<text>A software patent is a patent on a piece of software, such as a computer program, library, user interface, or algorithm. The validity of these patents can be difficult to evaluate, as software is often at once a product of engineering, something typically eligible for patents, and an abstract concept, which is typically not. This gray area, along with the difficulty of patent evaluation for intangible, technical works such as libraries and algorithms, makes software patents a frequent subject of controversy and litigation.

Different jurisdictions have radically different policies concerning software patents, including a blanket ban, no restrictions, or attempts to distinguish between purely mathematical constructs and &quot;embodiments&quot; of these constructs. For example, an algorithm itself may be judged unpatentable, but its use in software judged patentable.

==Background==
A patent is a set of exclusionary rights granted by a state to a patent holder for a limited period of time, usually 20 years. These rights are granted to patent applicants in exchange for their disclosure of the inventions. Once a patent is granted in a given country, no person may make, use, sell or import/export the claimed invention in that country without the permission of the patent holder. Permission, where granted, is typically in the form of a license which conditions are set by the patent owner: it may be free or in return for a royalty payment or lump sum fee.

Patents are territorial in nature. To obtain a patent, inventors must file patent applications in each and every country in which they want a patent. For example, separate applications must be filed in Japan, China, the United States and India if the applicant wishes to obtain patents in those countries. However, some regional offices exist, such as the European Patent Office (EPO), which act as supranational bodies with the power to grant patents which can then be brought into effect in the member states, and an international procedure also exists for filing a single international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which can then give rise to patent protection in most countries.

These different countries and regional offices have different standards for granting patents. This is particularly true of software or computer-implemented inventions, especially where the software is implementing a business method.

==Early example of a software patent==
On 21 May 1962, a British patent application entitled &quot;A Computer Arranged for the Automatic Solution of Linear Programming Problems&quot; was filed. The invention was concerned with efficient memory management for the simplex algorithm, and could be implemented by purely software means. The patent struggled to establish that it represented a &#x27;vendible product&#x27;. &quot;The focus of attention shifted to look at the relationship between the [unpatentable] computer program and the [potentially patentable] programmed computer&quot;. The patent was granted on August 17, 1966, and seems to be one of the first software patents, establishing the principle that the computer program itself was unpatentable and therefore covered by copyright law, while the computer program embedded in hardware was potentially patentable.

==Jurisdictions==
Most countries place some limits on the patenting of inventions involving software, but there is no one legal definition of a software patent. For example, U.S. patent law excludes &quot;abstract ideas&quot;, and this has been used to refuse some patents involving software. In Europe, &quot;computer programs as such&quot; are excluded from patentability, thus European Patent Office policy is consequently that a program for a computer is not patentable if it does not have the potential to cause a &quot;technical effect&quot; which is by now understood as a material effect (a &quot;transformation of nature&quot;). Substantive law regarding the patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions, and case law interpreting the legal provisions, are different under different jurisdictions.

Software patents under multilateral treaties:

* Software patents under TRIPs Agreement
* Software patents under the European Patent Convention
* Computer programs and the Patent Cooperation Treaty

Software patents under national laws:

* Software patents under United States patent law
* Software patents under United Kingdom patent law

===Australia===
In Australia, there is no particular exclusion for patents relating to software. The subject matter of an invention is patentable in Australia, if it is a &quot;manner of manufacture&quot; within the meaning of section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies. The High Court of Australia has refrained from ruling on the precise definition of manner of manufacture stating that any such attempt is bound to fail for the policy reason of encouraging national development in fields that may be unpredictable. In assessing whether an invention is a manner of manufacture, the High Court has relied on the inquiry of whether the subject of the claims defining the invention has as its end result an &quot;artificially created state of affairs&quot;.

In a decision of the Federal Court of Australia, on the patentability of an improved method of representing curved images in computer graphics displays, it was held that the application of selected mathematical methods to computers may involve steps which are foreign to the normal use of computers and hence amount to a manner of manufacture. In another unanimous decision by the Full Federal Court of Australia, an invention for methods of storing and retrieving Chinese characters to perform word processing was held to be an artificially created state of affairs and consequently within the concept of a manner of manufacture.

Nevertheless, in a recent decision on the patentability of a computer implemented method of generating an index based on selection and weighing of data based on certain criterion, the Full Federal Court of Australia reaffirmed that mere methods, schemes and plans are not manners of manufacture. The Full Court went on to hold that the use of a computer to implement a scheme did not contribute to the invention or the artificial effect of the invention. The subject matter of the invention was held to be an abstract idea and not a manner of manufacture within the meaning of the term in the Patents Act. The same Full Federal Court in another decision regarding the patentability of an invention regarding a method and system for assessing an individual&#x27;s competency in relation to certain criterion, reiterated that a business method or mere scheme were per se are not patentable.

In principle, computer software is still a valid patentable subject matter in Australia. But, in circumstances where patents have been sought over software to merely implement abstract ideas or business methods, the courts and the Commissioner of Patents have resisted granting patent protection to such applications both as a matter of statutory interpretation and policy.

===Canada===

In Canada, courts have held that the use of a computer alone neither lends, nor reduces patentability of an invention. However, it is the position of the Canadian Patent Office that where a computer is an &quot;essential element&quot; of a patent&#x27;s claims, the claimed invention is generally patentable subject matter.

===China===
In China, the starting time of software patent is relatively late. Before 2006, software patents were basically not granted, and software and hardware had to be combined when applying for a patent. With the development of network technology and software technology, China&#x27;s patent examination system has been constantly updated. Recently, the design idea of the software itself has been allowed to apply for patent separately, instead of requiring to be combined with hardware. However, software patent writing requirements are relatively high.

Software patents can be written as either a product or a method, depending on the standards of review. However, no matter what form it is written in, it is difficult to highlight the creativity of the scheme, which requires specific case analysis.

Software that can be patented mainly includes (but is not limited to):

(1) Industrial control software, such as controlling the movement of mechanical equipment;

(2) Software to improve the internal performance of the computer, such as a software can improve the virtual memory of the computer;

(3) External technical data processing software, such as digital camera image processing software.

It is fair to say that a considerable proportion of software belongs to category (3).

The patent protection measures can be seen in the patent law and the regulations on the protection of computer software.

===Europe===

Within European Union member states, the EPO and other national patent offices have issued many patents for inventions involving software since the European Patent Convention (EPC) came into force in the late 1970s. excludes &quot;programs for computers&quot; from patentability (Art. 52(2)) to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program &quot;as such&quot; (Art. 52(3)). This has been interpreted to mean that any invention that makes a non-obvious &quot;technical contribution&quot; or solves a &quot;technical problem&quot; in a non-obvious way is patentable even if that technical problem is solved by running a computer program.&lt;ref name=&quot;t0469/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When the EPO examines a patent application with questionable subject matter eligibility, their approach is to simply disregard any ineligible portions or aspects and evaluate the rest. This is notably different from the U.S. approach (see below).

Computer-implemented inventions that &quot;only&quot; solve a business problem using a computer, rather than a technical problem, are considered unpatentable as lacking an inventive step (see T 258/03). Nevertheless, the fact that an invention is useful in business does not mean it is not patentable if it also solves a technical problem.

A summary of the developments concerning patentability of computer programs under the European Patent Convention is given in (see G 3/08) as a response of the Enlarged Board of Appeal to questions filed by the President of the European Patent Office according to .

Concerns have been raised by free software campaigners, such as the Free Software Foundation, that the Unified Patent Court will be much more open to patents generally and software patents in particular.

====Germany====
In April 2013, the German Parliament adopted a joint motion &quot;against the growing trend of patent offices to grant patents on software programs&quot;.

====United Kingdom====

United Kingdom patent law is interpreted to have the same effect as the European Patent Convention such that &quot;programs for computers&quot; are excluded from patentability to the extent that a patent application relates to a computer program &quot;as such&quot;. Current case law in the UK states that an (alleged) invention will only be regarded as an invention if it provides a contribution that is not excluded and that is also technical. A computer program implementing a business process is therefore not an invention, but a computer program implementing an industrial process may well be.

===India===
In India, a clause to include software patents was quashed by the Indian Parliament in April 2005. However, following publication of the new guidelines on the examination of computer-related inventions on 19 February 2016, the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trade marks accepts applications for software patents, as long as the software is claimed in conjunction with a novel hardware. On 30 June 2017, revised guidelines on the examination of computer related inventions were published. This 2017 guidelines provides clarity on patentability of software invention in India, i.e., the claimed computer-related invention needs to be ascertained whether it is of a technical nature involving technical advancement as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both, and is not subject to exclusion under Section 3 of the Patents Act.
In 2019, the Court observed,
Patent applications in these fields would have to be examined to see if they result in a “technical contribution”, it added. Further elaborating on the usage of the term ‘per se’ in Section 3(k), the Court said,
With respect to the term per se, the joint parliamentary committee had expressed the following view:
===Japan===
Software-related inventions are patentable. To qualify as an invention, however, there must be &quot;a creation of technical ideas utilizing a law of nature&quot; although this requirement is typically met by &quot;concretely realising the information processing performed by the software by using hardware resources&quot;. Software-related inventions may be considered obvious if they involve the application of an operation known in other fields, the addition of a commonly known means or replacement by equivalent, the implementation in software of functions which were previously performed by hardware, or the systematisation of known human transactions.

In 1999, the allowance rate for business method patents at the Japan Patent Office (JPO) reached an all-time high of roughly 35 percent. Subsequently, the JPO experienced a surge in business method patent filings. This surge was met with a dramatic decrease in the average grant rate of business method patents during the following six years; it lingered around 8 percent between 2003 and 2006 (8 percent is extremely low in comparison to the average of 50 percent across all technical fields). A report from 2012 found that the average grant rate since 2006 for business method patents has risen to the current rate of roughly 25 percent.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand computer programs are excluded from patentability under the Patents Act 2013, but guidelines permitting embedded software were added since the initial Patents Bill. From 2013 computer programs &#x27;as such&#x27; are excluded from patentability. The as such wording rules out only those software based patents where novelty lies solely in the software. Similar to Europe.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, &quot;schemes, rules and methods of performing mental acts, playing games or doing business, and programs for computers&quot; are non-patentable inventions under Sec. 22.2 of Republic Act No. 8293, otherwise known as the &quot;Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines&quot;.

===Russian Federation===
In the Russian Federation according to article #1350 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation the following do not qualify as inventions:

# discoveries;
# scientific theories and mathematical methods;
# solutions concerning only the appearance of products and aimed at meeting the aesthetic needs;
# the rules and methods of games, intellectual or economic activities;
# computer programs; 
# solutions consisting only in the presentation of information.

However, the article provides for that the patentability of these objects is excluded only in the case when the application for the grant of a patent for an invention concerns these objects &quot;as such&quot;.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, &quot;a program for a computer&quot; is excluded from recognition as an invention by section 25(2) of the Patents Act. However, this restriction applies &quot;only to the extent to which a patent or an application for a patent relates to that thing as such&quot; and should not prevent, for example, a product, process, or method which may be implemented on a computer from being an invention, provided that the requirements of novelty and inventiveness are met.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, software is considered patentable and many patents directed towards &quot;computer programs&quot; have been issued. In 2006, Microsoft&#x27;s sales of its &quot;Office&quot; suite were jeopardized due to a possible patent infringement. A ruling by the Supreme Court of Korea found that patents directed towards automatic language translation within software programs were valid and possibly violated by its software.

===Thailand===
As like as 52(2) of the European Patent Convention (EPC), section 9 of the Thai Patent Act 1999 states that Thai patent law does not include software (or computer program) from patentability because the computer software is not considered as an “invention”, in which it is not the idea of the product itself. Hence, the software is considered as the manual or instruction that was controlled by users to perform the tasks.

A software patents law in Thailand has been controversial debates among the economists and national developers’ overtime since there were two significant developments in the international patent law; (1) the European Union&#x27;s attempt to harmonize national patent laws by the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, and (2) the US court decision to expand patent protection to business methods. The opinions are divided into two sides. Dr. Tangkitvanich, the IT specialist of Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), raised his concern that Thailand is not in a good stage for a software patent as there were several flaws in patent rights. For example, the business method prevention has high tendency to hinder the growth in innovations especially for the infant software companies. Moreover, the software patent may cause monopoly and innovation problems. “Monopoly will thwart innovations of new software products, particularly open-source software”, said by a group of Thai Economists. However, Dr. Hirapruk who is the Director of Software Park Thailand, on the other hand, provides his support on allowing the computer programs to be patentable: “Thailand had to provide a patent-right protection for computer software to ensure foreign high-tech investors that software producers&#x27; creativity would be secured from violations in Thailand”. As a result, Mr. Sribhibhadh, president of the Association of Thai Software Industry, emphasized that there will need to be a clear overview of the impact on the local industry if Thailand really had to fully implement the patent right protections.

===United States===
The first software patent was issued June 19, 1968 to Martin Goetz for a data sorting algorithm. The United States Patent and Trademark Office has granted patents that may be referred to as software patents since at least the early 1970s. In Gottschalk v. Benson (1972), the United States Supreme Court ruled that a patent for a process should not be allowed if it would &quot;wholly pre-empt the mathematical formula and in practical effect would be a patent on the algorithm itself&quot;, adding that &quot;it is said that the decision precludes a patent for any program servicing a computer. We do not so hold.&quot; In 1981, the Supreme Court stated that &quot;a claim drawn to subject matter otherwise statutory does not become nonstatutory simply because it uses a mathematical formula, computer program, or digital computer&quot; and a claim is patentable if it contains &quot;a mathematical formula [and] implements or applies the formula in a structure or process which, when considered as a whole, is performing a function which the patent laws were designed to protect&quot;. When a patent application is examined by the USPTO, the initial threshold question (for each claim) is whether the subject matter is eligible, so this is evaluated separately and prior to the other patentability criteria (novelty, nonobviousness). This is notably different than the European approach (see above).

Due to different treatment of federal patent rights in different parts of the country, in 1982 the U.S. Congress created a new court (the Federal Circuit) to hear patent cases. Following several landmark decisions by this court, by the early 1990s the patentability of software was well established, and in 1996 the USPTO issued Final Computer Related Examination Guidelines stating that &quot;A &quot;practical application&quot; of a computer-related invention is statutory subject matter. This requirement can be discerned from the variously phrased prohibitions against the patenting of abstract ideas, laws of nature or natural phenomena&quot; (emphasis added).

The emergence of the Internet and e-commerce led to many patents being applied for and being granted for business methods implemented in software and the question of whether business methods are statutory subject matter is a separate issue from the question of whether software is. Critics of the Federal Circuit believe that the non-obviousness standard is partly responsible for the large increase in patents for software and business methods. There have been several successful enforcement trials in the United States, some of which are listed in the list of software patents article.

An issue with software patent intellectual property rights is typically revolved around deciding whether the company or inventor owns it.

As a matter of law, in the United States, the employee generally owns the IP right unless the employee&#x27;s inventing skills or task to create the invention is the main specific hiring reason or a specific clause in the employment agreement assigning invention rights.

A work for hire created after 1978 has copyright protection for 120 years from its creation date or 90 years from its publication date whichever comes first. Patent protection for software lasts 20 years.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, software cannot be protected by patents, until the implementation of the Law No. 13 Year 2016, Patent Law in Indonesia. To begin evaluation, it is necessary to distinguish whether or not the application is considered an invention. Under Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 1 of Patent Law in Indonesia, application is considered as an invention if the activity is created to solve a particular conflict or problem in the technology sector. Furthermore, it can be executed in the medium of a new process or product or a developmental enhancement in a product or process. According to Law No. 14 Year 2001, Article 7 of Patent Law in Indonesia., an application can not be patented as an invention if the product or process contradicts or challenges the current regulations and rules, public order or ethics, and religious morality. In addition, if the application is treated as a method or theory in the scientific or mathematics, argued to be any type of living creatures, with the exception of micro-organisms, or is considered as an essential biological measure to produce plants or animals, the application is not a patentable invention.

As software contains algorithms, it is deemed to be part of the field of mathematics; hence, software cannot be protected by patents in Indonesia. However, one way for the Indonesian Intellectual Property office to grant software patents in Indonesia is if the application has been patented in other nations, which have ratified the Patent Corporation Treaty (PCT). Therefore, in accordance to the regulations under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, a software will have a regional protection among the participating entities of World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

An important update was enacted on 26 August 2016, the Law No. 13 Year 2016, Patent Law in Indonesia. This update is geared to encourage innovation and growth by augmenting the number of patents within the public and private sector in Indonesia. This update proposes an extension of protection for simple patent, which grants application for patents for new improvements or inventions to existing processes. Intangible inventions can also be patented; under the former law, simple patent is restricted for tangible inventions, which has a positive implication for software patents in Indonesia. Furthermore, these changes provide more protection to the pharmaceutical industry and encourage public access to medical knowledge. This can boost new software ideas and processes within the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector. This update provides a stronger protection of traditional knowledge. In addition, a significant update is the usability of electronic filling and electronic media. Under this new law, application can be made electronically.

==Purpose of patents==

For the U.S., the purpose of patents is laid down in the constitutional clause that gives Congress the power to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;&quot; (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8). For Europe, there is no similar definition. Commonly four patent justification theories are recognised, as laid down for instance by Machlup in 1958, which include justice to the inventor and benefit for society by rewarding inventors. Disclosure is required in return for the exclusive right, and disclosure may promote further development. However, the value of disclosure should not be overestimated: some inventions could not be kept secret otherwise, and patents also prohibit independent reinventions to be exploited.

There is debate as to whether or not these aims are achieved with software patents.

==Proposals==
In seeking to find a balance, different countries have different policies as to where the boundary between patentable and non-patentable software should lie. In Europe, a number of different proposals for setting a boundary line were put forward during the debate concerning the proposed Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, none of which were found acceptable by the various parties to the debate. Two particular suggestions for a hurdle that software must pass to be patentable include:

* A computer program that utilises &quot;controllable forces of nature to achieve predictable results&quot;.
* A computer program which provides a &quot;technical effect&quot;.

In the US, Ben Klemens, a Guest Scholar at the Brookings Institution, proposed that patents should be granted only to inventions that include a physical component that is by itself nonobvious. This is based on Justice William Rehnquist&#x27;s ruling in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Diamond v. Diehr that stated that &quot;... insignificant postsolution activity will not transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process.&quot; By this rule, one would consider software loaded onto a stock PC to be an abstract algorithm with obvious postsolution activity, while a new circuit design implementing the logic would likely be a nonobvious physical device. Upholding an &quot;insignificant postsolution activity&quot; rule as per Justice Rehnquist&#x27;s ruling would also eliminate most business method patents.

==Obviousness==
A common objection to software patents is that they relate to trivial inventions. A patent on an invention that many people would easily develop independently of one another should not, it is argued, be granted since this impedes development.

Different countries have different ways of dealing with the question of inventive step and non-obviousness in relation to software patents. Europe uses an &#x27;Inventive step test&#x27;; see the Inventive step requirement in Europe and, for instance, T 258/03.

==Criticism==

===Compatibility===
There are a number of high-profile examples where the patenting of a data exchange standards forced another programming group to introduce an alternative format. For instance, the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format was largely introduced to avoid the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) patent problems, and Ogg Vorbis to avoid MP3. If it is discovered that these new suggested formats are themselves covered by existing patents, the final result may be a large number of incompatible formats. Creating such formats and supporting them costs money and creates inconvenience to users.

===Computer-implemented invention (CII)===

Under the European Patent Convention (EPC), and in particular its Article 52, &quot;programs for computers&quot; are not regarded as inventions for the purpose of granting European patents, but this exclusion from patentability only applies to the extent to which a European patent application or European patent relates to a computer program as such. As a result of this partial exclusion, and despite the fact that the EPO subjects patent applications in this field to a much stricter scrutiny when compared to their American counterpart, that does not mean that all inventions including some software are &quot;de jure&quot; not patentable.

===Overlap with copyright===

Patent and copyright protection constitute two different means of legal protection which may cover the same subject matter, such as computer programs, since each of these two means of protection serves its own purpose. Software is protected as works of literature under the Berne Convention. This allows the creator to prevent another entity from copying the program and there is generally no need to register code in order for it to be copyrighted.

Patents, on the other hand, give their owners the right to prevent others from using the technology defined by the patent claims, even if the technology was independently developed and there was no copying of a software or software code involved. In fact, one of the most recent EPO decisions clarifies the distinction, stating that software is patentable, because it is basically only a technical method executed on a computer, which is to be distinguished from the program itself for executing the method, the program being merely an expression of the method, and thus being copyrighted.

Patents cover the underlying methodologies embodied in a given piece of software, or the function that the software is intended to serve, independent of the particular language or code that the software is written in. Copyright prevents the direct copying of some or all of a particular version of a given piece of software, but does not prevent other authors from writing their own embodiments of the underlying methodologies. Assuming a dataset meets certain criteria, copyright can also be used to prevent a given set of data from being copied while still allowing the author to keep the contents of said set of data a trade secret.

Whether and how the numerus clausus principle shall apply to the legal hybrid software to provide a judicious balance between property rights of the title holders and freedom rights of computing professionals and society as a whole, is in dispute.

===Debate===
There is a debate over the extent to which software patents should be granted, if at all. Important issues concerning software patents include:

* Whether software patents should be allowed, and if so, where the boundary between patentable and non-patentable software should lie;
* Whether the inventive step and non-obviousness requirement is applied too loosely to software; and
* Whether patents covering software discourage, rather than encourage, innovation;
*Whether software based on mathematical methods may be allowed if the mathematics or algorithm in question is complicated enough and may not be implemented with pencil and paper.

===Open source software===

There is strong dislike in the free software community towards software patents. Much of this has been caused by free software or open source projects terminating when the owners of patents covering aspects of a project demanded license fees that the project could not pay, or was not willing to pay, or offered licenses with terms that the project was unwilling to accept, or could not accept, because it conflicted with the free software license in use.

Several patent holders have offered royalty-free patent licenses for a very small portion of their patent portfolios. Such actions have provoked only minor reaction from the free and open source software communities for reasons such as fear of the patent holder changing their mind or the license terms being so narrow as to have little use. Companies that have done this include Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Nokia, Novell, Red Hat, and Sun (now Oracle).

In 2005, Sun Microsystems announced that they were making a portfolio of 1,600 patents available through a patent license called Common Development and Distribution License.

In 2006, Microsoft&#x27;s pledge not to sue Novell Linux customers, openSUSE contributors, and free/open source software developers over patents and the associated collaboration agreement with Novell was met with disdain from the Software Freedom Law Center while commentators from the Free Software Foundation stated that the agreement would not comply with GPLv3. Meanwhile, Microsoft has reached similar agreements with Dell and Samsung, due to alleged patent infringements of the Linux operating system. Microsoft has also derived revenue from Android by making such agreements-not-to-sue with Android vendors.

===Unisys case===
In the late 1990s, Unisys claimed to have granted royalty free licenses to hundreds of not-for-profit organizations that used the patented LZW compression method and, by extension, the GIF image format. However, this did not include most software developers and Unisys were &quot;barraged&quot; by negative and &quot;sometimes obscene&quot; emails from software developers.

===Licensing===

Patenting software is widespread in the US. , approximately 500,000 patents had issued in the 23 classes of patents covering &quot;computer implemented inventions&quot; (see table).

Many software companies cross license their patents to each other. These agreements allow each party to practice the other party&#x27;s patented inventions without the threat of being sued for patent infringement. Microsoft, for example, has agreements with IBM, Sun (now Oracle), SAP, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens, Cisco, Autodesk, and recently Novell. Microsoft cross-licensed its patents with Sun, despite being direct competitors, and with Autodesk even though Autodesk has far fewer patents than Microsoft.

The ability to negotiate cross licensing agreements is a major reason that many software companies, including those providing open source software, file patents. As of June 2006, for example, Red Hat had developed a portfolio of 10 issued US patents, 1 issued European patent, 163 pending US patent applications, and 33 pending international PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty) patent applications. Red Hat uses this portfolio to cross license with proprietary software companies so that they can preserve their freedom to operate.

Other patent holders are in the business of inventing new &quot;computer implemented inventions&quot; and then commercializing the inventions by licensing the patents to other companies that manufacture the inventions. Walker Digital, for example, has generated a large patent portfolio from its research efforts, including the basic patent on the Priceline.com reverse auction technology. US universities also fall into this class of patent owners. They collectively generate about $1.4 billion per year through licensing the inventions they develop to both established and start up companies in all fields of technology, including software.

Still other patent holders focus on obtaining patents from original inventors and licensing them to companies that have introduced commercial products into the marketplace after the patents were filed. Some of these patent holders, such as Intellectual Ventures, are privately held companies financed by large corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Google, etc. Others, such as Acacia Technologies, are publicly traded companies with institutional investors being the primary shareholders.

The practice of acquiring patents merely to license them is controversial in the software industry. Companies that have this business model are pejoratively referred to as patent trolls. It is an integral part of the business model that patent licensing companies sue infringers that do not take a license. Furthermore, they may take advantage of the fact that many companies will pay a modest license fee (e.g. $100,000 to $1,000,000) for rights to a patent of questionable validity, rather than pay the high legal fees ($2,000,000 or more) to demonstrate in court that the patent is invalid.

<text>Shatranj (, ; from , ) is an old form of chess, as played in the Sasanian Empire. Its origins lie in the Indian game of chaturanga. Modern chess gradually developed from this game, as it was introduced to Europe by contacts in Muslim Al-Andalus (modern Spain) and in Sicily in the 10th century. In modern Persian, the term is also used as the translation of chess.

==Etymology and origins==
The name of the game in adjoining countries appears to be derived from chaturanga - chatrang in Persian, shatranj in Arabic, Chanderaki in Tibetan are examples. This suggests that the game, as well as its name, came from India. Also, as will appear, it was believed in Persia that the game arrived there from India. The Persian word ultimately derives from Sanskrit (; ) (: &quot;four&quot;; : &quot;arm&quot;), referring to the game of the same name: Chaturanga. In Middle Persian the word appears as , with the &#x27;u&#x27; lost due to syncope and the &#x27;a&#x27; lost to apocope, such as in the title of the text (&quot;Book of Chess&quot;) from the 7th century AD.

The Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan refers to Ardashir I as a master of the game: &quot;By the help of Providence, Ardeshir became more victorious and warlike than all, on the polo and the riding-ground, at Chatrang and Vine-Artakhshir, and in several other arts.&quot; However, &quot;Karnamak&quot; contains many fables and legends, and this only establishes the popularity of chatrang at the time of its composition.

During the reign of the later Sassanid king Khosrau I (531–579), a gift from an Indian king (possibly a Maukhari Dynasty king of Kannauj) included a chess game with sixteen pieces of emerald and sixteen of ruby (green vs. red). The game came with a challenge which was successfully resolved by Khosrau&#x27;s courtiers. This incident, originally referred to in the (c. 620 AD), is also mentioned in Ferdowsi&#x27;s Shahnama (c. 1010).

The rules of chaturanga seen in India today have enormous variation, but all involve four branches (&quot;angas&quot;) of the army: the horse (knight), the elephant (bishop), the chariot (rook) and the foot soldier (pawn), played on an 8×8 board. Shatranj adapted much of the same rules as chaturanga, and also the basic 16-piece structure. There is also a larger 10×11 board derivative; the 14th-century Tamerlane chess, or (perfect chess), with a slightly different piece structure.

In some later variants the darker squares were engraved. The game spread Westwards after the Islamic conquest of Persia and a considerable body of literature on game tactics and strategy was produced from the 8th century onwards.

In early Indian chaturanga ( 500–700), the king could be and this ended the game. Persian shatranj (c. 700–800) introduced the idea of warning that the king was under attack (announcing &quot;check&quot; in modern terminology). This was done to avoid the early and accidental end of a game. Later the Persians added the additional rule that a king could not be moved into check or left in check. As a result, the king could not be captured, and checkmate was the only decisive way of ending a game.

With the spread of Islam, chess diffused into the Maghreb and then to Andalusian Spain. During the Islamic conquest of India (c. 12th century), some forms came back to India as well, as evidenced in the North Indian term &quot;māt&quot; (mate, derivative from Persian ) or the Bengali (pawn, presumed derived from the Arabic ). Over the following centuries, chess became popular in Europe, eventually giving rise to modern chess.

==Rules==

The initial setup in shatranj was essentially the same as in modern chess; however, the position of the white shah (king), on the right or left side was not fixed. Either the arrangement as in modern chess or as shown in the diagram were possible. In either case, the white and black shāh would be on the same file. The game was played with these pieces:

* Shāh (&quot;king&quot; in Persian) moves like the king in chess.
* Ferz (Wazir) (&quot;counselor&quot;; also spelled &quot;fers&quot;; Arabic &quot;firz&quot;, from Persian &quot;farzīn&quot;) moves exactly one square diagonally, which makes it a rather weak piece. It was renamed &quot;queen&quot; in Europe. Even today, the word for the queen piece is &quot;ферзь&quot; (ferz) in Russian, &quot;vezér&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;vezir&quot; in Turkish, &quot;vazīr&quot; in Persian and &quot;wazīr&quot; in Arabic. It has analogue to the guards in xiangqi.
* Rukh (&quot;chariot&quot;; from Persian &quot;rokh&quot;) moves like the rook in chess.
* Pīl, alfil, aufin, and similar (&quot;elephant&quot;; from Persian &quot;pīl&quot;; al- is the Arabic for &quot;the&quot;) moves exactly two squares diagonally, jumping over the square between. Each pīl could reach only one-eighth of the squares on the board, and because their circuits were disjoint, they could never capture one another. This piece might have had a different move sometimes in chaturanga, where the piece is also called &quot;elephant&quot;. The pīl was replaced by the bishop in modern chess. Even today, the word for the bishop piece is &quot;alfil&quot; in Spanish, &quot;alfiere&quot; in Italian, &quot;fil&quot; in Turkish, &quot;fīl&quot; in Persian and Arabic, and &quot;слон&quot; (&quot;elephant&quot;) in Russian. As chess spread from Iran northward to Russia, and westward into eastern Europe, south to Italy, and finally westward, it mostly retained the original name and look of the piece as an elephant. Usually, it was carved as a rounded shape with two blunt points representing the elephant&#x27;s tusks. In Christian Europe, this piece became a bishop because the two points looked like a bishop&#x27;s mitre to those unfamiliar with elephants in Western Europe. An early example of the bishop being used is the Lewis chessmen chess set of the 12th century. The elephant piece survives in xiangqi with the limitations that the elephant in xiangqi cannot jump over an intervening piece and is restricted to the owner&#x27;s half of the board. In janggi, its movement was changed to become a slightly further-reaching version of the horse.
* Asb (Faras) (current meaning of &quot;horse&quot; in Persian, from old Persian &quot;Asp&quot; ()), moves like the knight in chess.
* Piyadeh (&quot;infantryman&quot;; from Persian &quot;piyāde&quot;; also called Sarbaz &quot;soldier&quot;) in Persian and adopted later to &quot;Baydaq&quot; () in Arabic (a new singular extracted by treating the Persian form as an Arabic broken plural), moves and captures like the pawns in chess, but not moving two squares on the first move. When they reach the eighth rank, they are promoted to ferz.

Pieces are shown on the diagrams and recorded in the notation using the equivalent modern symbols, as in the table above. In modern descriptions of shatranj, the names king, rook, knight and pawn are commonly used for shah, rukh, faras, and baidaq. However, the ferz and alfil are sometimes treated as distinct, and given their own symbols. Specific ferz and alfil symbols have been provisionally accepted for a future version of Unicode.

There were also other differences compared to modern chess: Castling was not allowed (it was invented much later). Stalemating the opposing king resulted in a win for the player delivering stalemate. Capturing all one&#x27;s opponent&#x27;s pieces apart from the king (&quot;baring the king&quot;) was a win, unless the opponent could capture the last piece on their next move, which was considered a draw in most places in the Islamic world (except for Medina, where it was a win).

The possible movements of the main shatranj pieces, excluding that of the king and pawn, are complementary to one another, and without any omission or redundancy occupy all available squares with respect to the central position of a 5x5 grid, as shown in the figure to the right.

=== Middle Persian literature ===
Three books written in Pahlavi, &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot;, &quot;Khosrow and ridag&quot;, and &quot;Wizārišn ī čhatrang&quot; (&quot;Treatise on Chess&quot;), also known as the &quot;Chatrang Nama&quot; (&quot;Book of Chess&quot;), all mention &quot;chatrang&quot;. In &quot;Kār-nāmak&quot; it is said that Ardashīr &quot;with the help of the gods became more victorious and experienced than all others in polo, horsemanship, chess, backgammon, and other arts,&quot; and in the small treatise on &quot;Khosrow and ridag&quot;, the latter declares that he is superior to his comrades in chess, backgammon, and &quot;hašt pāy&quot;. Bozorgmehr, the author of &quot;Wizārišn ī čhatrang&quot;, describes how the game of chess was sent as a test to Khosrow I (r. 531–79) by the &quot;king of the Hindus Dēvsarm&quot; with the envoy Takhtarītūs and how the test was answered by the vizier Bozorgmehr, who in his turn invented the game Backgammon as a test for the Hindus. These three Middle Persian sources do not give any certain indication of the date when chess was introduced into Persia. The mentions of chess in &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot; and &quot;Khosrow and ridag&quot; are simply conventional and may easily represent late Sasanian or even post-Sasanian redactions. According to Touraj Daryaee, &quot;Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan&quot; is from 6th century. &quot;Wizārišn ī čhatrang&quot; was written in the 6th century.

===Early Arabic literature===
During the Islamic Golden Age, many works on shatranj were written, recording for the first time the analysis of opening moves, game problems, the knight&#x27;s tour, and many more subjects common in modern chess books. Many of these manuscripts are missing, but their content is known due to compilation work done by the later authors.

The earliest listing of works on chess is in the &quot;Fihrist&quot;, a general bibliography produced in 377 AH (988 AD) by Ibn al-Nadim. It includes an entire section on the topic of chess, listing:
* Al-Adli&#x27;s &quot;Kitab ash-shatranj&quot; (&#x27;Book of Chess&#x27;)
* Ar-Razi&#x27;s &quot;Latif fi &#x27;sh-shatranj&quot; (&#x27;Fun with Chess&#x27;)
* As-Suli&#x27;s &quot;Kitab ash-shatranj&quot; (two volumes)
* Al-Lajlaj&#x27;s &quot;Kitab mansubat ash-shatranj&quot; (&#x27;Book: Strategies of Chess&#x27;)
* B. Aluqlidisi&#x27;s &quot;Kitab majmu&#x27; fi mansubat ash-shatranj&quot; (&#x27;Book: Intent of Strategies of Chess&#x27;)

There is a passage referring to chess in a work said to be by al-Hasan al-Basri, a philosopher from Basra who died in 728 AD. The attribution of authorship is dubious, however.

===Player classification===
Al-Adli as well as As-Suli introduced classifications of players by their playing strength. Both of them specify five classes of players:
* Aliyat (or aliya), grandees
* Mutaqaribat, proximes – players who could win 2–4 games out of 10 in the match against grandee. They received odds of a pawn from grandee (better players g-, a- or h-pawn, weaker ones d- or e-pawn).
* Third class – players who received odds of a ferz from grandee.
* Fourth class – received odds of a knight.
* Fifth class – received odds of a rook.

To determine a player&#x27;s class, a series or match would be undertaken with a player of a known class without odds. If the player won 7 or more games out of 10, he belonged to a higher class.

===Notable players===
During the reign of the Arab caliphs, shatranj players of highest class were called &quot;aliyat&quot; or grandees. There were only a few players in this category including:
* Jabir al-Kufi, Rabrab and Abun-Naam were three aliyat players during the rule of caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun.
* Al-Adli was the strongest player during the rule of caliph al-Wathiq. At this time he was the only player in aliyat category.
* Al-Razi (Persian polymath) in 847 won a match against an already old al-Adli in the presence of caliph al-Mutawakkil and so become a player of aliyat category.
* As-Suli was the strongest player during the reign of caliph al-Muktafi. Al-Razi was already dead and there were no players of comparable strength before as-Suli appeared on the scene. In the presence of al-Muktafi he easily won a match against a certain al-Mawardi and thus proved that he was the best player of that time. As-Suli considered Rabrab and al-Razi as the greatest of his predecessors.
* Al-Lajlaj was a pupil of as-Suli and also a great shatranj master of his time.

==Gameplay==

===Openings===

Openings in shatranj were usually called taʿbīya (pl. taʿbīyāt), in Arabic, which can be translated as &quot;battle array&quot;. Due to slow piece development in shatranj, the exact sequence of moves was relatively unimportant. Instead players aimed to reach a specific position, tabiya, mostly ignoring the play of their opponent.

The works of al-Adli and as-Suli contain collections of tabiyat. Tabiyat were usually given as position on a half-board with some comments about them. The concrete sequence of moves to reach them was not specified. In his book Al-Lajlaj analyzed some tabiya in detail. He started his analysis from some given opening, for example &quot;Double Mujannah&quot; or &quot;Mujannah–Mashaikhi&quot;, and then continued up to move 40, giving numerous variations.

===Piece values===
Both al-Adli and as-Suli provided estimation of piece values in their books on shatranj. They used a monetary system to specify piece values. For example, as-Suli gives piece values in dirhem, the currency in use in his time:

==Mansubat==

Persian chess masters composed many shatranj problems. Such shatranj problems were called manṣūba (pl. manṣūbāt), . This word can be translated from Arabic as &quot;arrangement&quot;, &quot;position&quot; or &quot;situation&quot;. Mansubat were typically composed in such a way that a win could be achieved as a sequence of checks. One&#x27;s own king was usually threatened by immediate checkmate.

One Mansuba is the &quot;Dilaram Problem&quot;. Black threatens immediate checkmate by 1...Ra2#, Ra8#, or either Rb4#. But White can win with a two-rook sacrifice:
:1. Rh8+ Kxh8 2. Bf5+ Kg8 3. Rh8+ Kxh8 4. g7+ Kg8 5. Nh6

Note that the alfil (♗) moves two squares diagonally, jumping over intermediate pieces; this allows it to jump over the white knight to deliver the discovered check from the second rook with 2.Bf5+. It was said that a nobleman (playing White) wagered his wife Dilārām on a chess game and this position arose. She appealed &quot;Sacrifice your two Rooks, and not me.&quot;

<doc id="76272" wikidata="Q1529151" url="?curid=76272" title="Glamis Castle">
<text>Glamis Castle is situated beside the village of Glamis (, ) in Angus, Scotland. It is the home of the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and is open to the public.

Glamis Castle has been the home of the Lyon family since the 14th century, though the present building dates largely from the 17th century. Glamis Castle was the childhood home of the late Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother. Her second daughter, Princess Margaret was born there on 21 August 1930.

The castle is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens.

==Setting==
Glamis is set in the broad and fertile lowland valley of Strathmore, in Forfar, county town of Angus, which lies between the Sidlaw Hills to the south and the Grampian Mountains to the north, approximately inland from the North Sea. The estate surrounding the castle covers more than and, in addition to parks and gardens, produces several cash crops including lumber and beef. There are two streams running through the estate, one of them the Glamis Burn. An arboretum overlooking Glamis Burn features trees from all over the world, many of them rare and several hundred years old.

==History==

The vicinity of Glamis Castle has prehistoric traces; for example, a noted intricately carved Pictish stone known as the Eassie Stone was found in a creek-bed at the nearby village of Eassie.

In 1034, Malcolm II was murdered at Glamis, where there was a Royal Hunting Lodge. In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1603–06), the eponymous character resides at Glamis Castle, although the historical King Macbeth (d. 1057) had no connection to the castle.

By 1372, a castle had been built at Glamis, since in that year it was granted by Robert II to Sir John Lyon, Thane of Glamis, husband of the king&#x27;s daughter. Glamis has remained in the Lyon (later Bowes-Lyon) family since this time. The castle was rebuilt as an L-plan tower house in the early 15th century.

The title Lord Glamis was created in 1445 for Sir Patrick Lyon (1402–1459), grandson of Sir John. John Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis, married Janet Douglas, daughter of the Master of Angus, at a time when James V was feuding with the Douglases. In December 1528, Janet was accused of treason for bringing supporters of the Earl of Angus to Edinburgh. She was then charged with poisoning her husband, Lord Glamis, who had died on 17 September 1528. Eventually, she was accused of witchcraft, and was burned at the stake at Edinburgh on 17 July 1537. James V subsequently seized Glamis, living there for some time.

In 1543, Glamis was returned to John Lyon, 7th Lord Glamis. In 1606, Patrick Lyon, 9th Lord Glamis, was created Earl of Kinghorne. He began major works on the castle, commemorated by the inscription &quot;Built by Patrick, Lord Glamis, and D[ame] Anna Murray&quot; on the central tower. The English architect Inigo Jones has traditionally been linked to the redesign of the castle, though Historic Scotland consider the King&#x27;s Master Mason William Schaw a more likely candidate, due to the traditional Scottish style of the architecture.

During the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, soldiers were garrisoned at Glamis. In 1670,
Patrick Lyon, 3rd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, returned to the castle and found it uninhabitable. Restorations took place until 1689, including the creation of a major Baroque garden. John Lyon, 9th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, succeeded in 1753, and in 1767 he married Mary Eleanor Bowes, heiress to a coal-mining fortune. He set about improving the grounds of the castle in the picturesque style in the 1770s. The south-west wing was rebuilt after a fire in the early 19th century. In the 1920s, a huge fireplace from Gibside, the Bowes-Lyon estate near Gateshead, was removed and placed in Glamis&#x27; Billiard Room. The fireplace displays the coat of arms of the Blakiston family; Gibside heiress Elizabeth Blakiston had married Sir William Bowes. Several interiors, including the Dining Room, also date from the 18th and 19th centuries.

In 1900, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon was born, the youngest daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and his wife, Cecilia (née Cavendish-Bentinck). She spent much of her childhood at Glamis, which was used during the First World War as a military hospital. She was particularly instrumental in organising the rescue of the castle&#x27;s contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916. On 26 April 1923 she married Prince Albert, Duke of York, second son of George V, at Westminster Abbey. Their second daughter, Princess Margaret, was born at Glamis Castle in 1930.

Since 1987, an illustration of the castle has featured on the reverse side of ten pound notes issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland. Glamis is currently the home of Simon Bowes-Lyon, 19th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, who succeeded to the earldom in 2016.

==Statuary==
In the 17th century four &quot;brazen&quot; statues were placed on the approach avenue: Charles I in boots; James VI in a stole; Charles II in Roman dress; and James II as in his Whitehall portrait. The first two were sculpted by Arnold Quellin.

==Legends and tales==

===The Monster of Glamis===

The most famous legend connected with the castle is that of the Monster of Glamis, a hideously deformed child born to the family. Some accounts came from singer and composer Virginia Gabriel who stayed at the castle in 1870. In the story, the monster was kept in the castle all his life and his suite of rooms bricked up after his death. Another monster is supposed to have dwelt in Loch Calder near the castle.

An alternative version of the legend is that to every generation of the family a vampire child is born and is walled up in that room.

There is an old story that guests staying at Glamis once hung towels from the windows of every room in a bid to find the bricked-up suite of the monster. When they looked at it from outside, several windows were apparently towel-less. Though this is more likely due to the owners removing them in order so that the guests would not find the rooms, according to several relatives of the family.

The legend of the monster may have been inspired by the true story of the Ogilvies.

===Earl Beardie===
A legend tells of the 15th-century &quot;Earl Beardie,&quot; who has been identified with both Alexander Lyon, 2nd Lord Glamis (died 1486), and with Alexander Lindsay, 4th Earl of Crawford (died 1453). Several versions exist, but they all involve &quot;Earl Beardie&quot; playing cards. However, it was the sabbath, and either his hosts refused to play, or a servant advised him to stop. Lord Beardie became so furious that he claimed that he would play until doomsday, or with the Devil himself, depending on the version. A stranger then appears at the castle and joins Lord Beardie in a game of cards. The stranger is identified with the Devil, who takes Earl Beardie&#x27;s soul and, in some versions, condemns the Earl to play cards until doomsday.

===Other traditions===
According to the official website for Glamis Castle, in 1034, Malcolm II was mortally wounded in a nearby battle and taken to a Royal Hunting Lodge, which sat at the site of the present castle, where he died.

==Description==

The towers in front of the castle each measure in diameter and are about high, each having a modern parapet. The walls are thick.

There is a small chapel within the castle with seating for 46 people. The story given to visitors by castle tour guides states that one seat in the chapel is always reserved for the &quot;White Lady&quot; (supposedly a ghost which inhabits the castle), thought to be Janet Douglas, Lady Glamis. According to the guides, the chapel is still used regularly for family functions, but no one is allowed to sit in that seat. 

==Archives==
The clock tower houses the castle&#x27;s archives which include a wide range of historical material relating to the castle and the Bowes and Lyon families. These include a papal bull and the memoirs of Mary Eleanor Bowes. The Glamis archives have a close connection with the archives at the University of Dundee, and researchers who wish to consult material held in the Glamis Castle Archive do so in the search room at the University.

==In popular culture==
In the British children’s television series Thomas &amp; Friends, Lord Callan’s castle is based on Glamis Castle. 

The 1982 Yoko Tsuno album &quot;La Proie et l&#x27;ombre&quot; by Roger Leloup prominently features the fictional &quot;Loch Castle&quot;, which is drawn as being near-identical to Glamis Castle.

<doc id="76273" wikidata="Q4127" url="?curid=76273" title="Lake Constance">
<text>Lake Constance (, ) refers to three bodies of water on the Rhine at the northern foot of the Alps: Upper Lake Constance (&quot;Obersee&quot;), Lower Lake Constance (&quot;Untersee&quot;), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein (). These waterbodies lie within the Lake Constance Basin () in the Alpine Foreland through which the Rhine flows. The nearby &quot;Mindelsee&quot; is not considered part of Lake Constance.
The lake is situated where Germany, Switzerland, and Austria meet. Its shorelines lie in the German states of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria; the Swiss cantons of St. Gallen, Thurgau, and Schaffhausen; and the Austrian state of Vorarlberg. The actual locations of the country borders within the lake are disputed.

The Alpine Rhine forms, in its original course (Alter Rhein), the Austro-Swiss border and flows into the lake from the south. The High Rhine flows westbound out of the lake and forms (with the exception of the Canton of Schaffhausen, Rafzerfeld and Basel-Stadt) the German-Swiss border as far as to the city of Basel. The Leiblach forms the Austria–Germany border east of the lake.

The most populous towns on the Upper Lake are Constance (), Friedrichshafen, Bregenz, Lindau, Überlingen and Kreuzlingen. The largest town on the Lower Lake is Radolfzell. The largest islands are Reichenau in the Lower Lake, and Lindau and Mainau in the Upper Lake. Bodanrück, a large peninsula, separates the Upper and Lower Lake.

While in English and in the Romance languages, the lake is named after the city of Constance, the German name derives from the village of Bodman (municipality of Bodman-Ludwigshafen), in the northwesternmost corner of the lake.

==Description==
Lake Constance is located along the Rhine between the Alpine Rhine, its main tributary, and the High Rhine, its outflow. It is the third largest freshwater lake by surface area in Central and Western Europe (and the second largest in volume), after Lake Geneva and (in surface area) Lake Balaton.

It is long, and, nearly at its widest point. It covers about , and is above sea level. Its greatest depth is , exactly in the middle of the Upper Lake. Its volume is about .

The lake has two parts. The main east section, called Obersee or &quot;Upper Lake&quot;, covers about , including its northwestern arm, the Überlinger See (), and the smaller west section, called Untersee or &quot;Lower Lake&quot;, with an area of about .

The connection between these two lakes is the Seerhein (lit.: &quot;Rhine of the Lake(s)&quot;). Geographically, usually it is not considered to be part of the lake, but a very short river.

The Lower Lake Constance is loosely divided into three sections around the Island of Reichenau. The two German parts, the Gnadensee (lit.: &quot;Lake Mercy&quot;) north of the island and north of the peninsula of Mettnau (the Markelfinger Winkel), and the Zeller See, south of Radolfzell and to the northwest of the Reichenau island, and the mainly Swiss Rheinsee (lit.: &quot;Lake Rhine&quot;) – not to be mistaken for the &quot;Seerhein&quot; (lit.: &quot;Rhine of the Lake(s)&quot;) at its start – to the south of the island and with its southwestern arm leading to its effluent in Stein am Rhein.

The water of the regulated Alpine Rhine flows into the lake in the southeast near Bregenz, Austria, then through the Upper Lake Constance hardly targeting the &quot;Überlinger See&quot;, into the &quot;Seerhein&quot; in the town of Konstanz, then through the &quot;Rheinsee&quot; virtually without feeding both German parts of the Lower Lake, and finally feeds the start of the High Rhine in Swiss town Stein am Rhein.

The lake itself is an important source of drinking water for southwestern Germany.

The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the Swiss peak Piz Russein of the Tödi massif of the Glarus Alps at above sea level. It starts with the creek &quot;Aua da Russein&quot; (lit.: &quot;Water of the Russein&quot;).

==History==
Lake Constance was formed by the Rhine Glacier during the Quaternary glaciation ice age and is a &quot;Zungenbecken&quot; or Tongue lake. After the end of the last glacial period, about 10,000 years ago, the Obersee and Untersee still formed a single lake. The downward erosion of the High Rhine caused the lake level to gradually sink and a sill, the &quot;Konstanzer Schwelle&quot;, to emerge.

The Rhine, the Bregenzer Ach, and the Dornbirner Ach carry sediments from the Alps to the lake, thus gradually decreasing the depth and reducing the extension of the lake in the southeast.

In antiquity, the two lakes had different names; later, for reasons which are unknown, they came to have the same name.

In the 19th century, there were five different local time zones around Lake Constance. Constance, belonging to the Grand Duchy of Baden, adhered to Karlsruhe time, Friedrichshafen used the time of the Duchy of Württemberg, in Lindau, the Bavarian Munich time was observed, and Bregenz used Prague time, while the Swiss shore used Berne time. One would have needed to travel only to visit five time zones. Given the amount of trade and traffic over Lake Constance, this led to serious confusion. Public clocks in harbors used three different clock faces, depending on the destinations offered by the boat companies. In 1892, all German territories used CET, the Austrian railways had already introduced CET the previous year and Switzerland followed in 1894. Because traffic timetables had not been yet updated, CET became the sole valid time around and on Lake Constance in 1895.

=== Name ===
The earliest recorded reference to the lakes is by Roman geographer Pomponius Mela around 43 AD, calling the upper lake &quot;Lacus Venetus&quot; and the lower lake &quot;Lacus Acronius&quot;, the Rhine passing through both. Around 75 AD, the naturalist Pliny the Elder called them both &quot;Lacus Raetiae Brigantinus&quot; after the main Roman town on the lake, &quot;Brigantium&quot; (later Bregenz). This name is associated with the Celtic Brigantii who lived here, although it is not clear whether the place was named after the tribe or the inhabitants of the region were named after their main settlement. Ammianus Marcellinus later used the form &quot;Lacus Brigantiae&quot;.

The current German name of &quot;Bodensee&quot; derives from the place name Bodman, which probably originally derived from the Old High German &quot;bodamon&quot; which meant &quot;on the soils&quot;, indicating a place on level terrain by the lake. This place, situated at the west end of Lake Überlingen (&quot;Überlinger See&quot;), had a more supraregional character for a certain period in the early Middle Ages as a Frankish imperial palace (&quot;Königspfalz&quot;), Alamannian ducal seat and mint, which is why the name may have been transferred to the lake (&quot;lake, by which Bodman is situated&quot; = &quot;Bodmansee&quot;). From 833/834 AD, in Latin sources, the name appears in its Latinised form &quot;lacus potamicus&quot;. Therefore, the name actually derived from the Bodman &quot;Pfalz&quot; (Latinized as &quot;Potamum&quot;) was wrongly assumed by monastic scholars like Walahfrid Strabo to be derived from the Greek word &quot;potamos&quot; for &quot;river&quot; and meant &quot;river lake&quot;. They may also have been influenced by the fact that the Rhine flowed through the lake.

Wolfram von Eschenbach describes it in Middle High German as the &quot;Bodemensee&quot; or &quot;Bodemsee&quot; which has finally evolved into the present German name, &quot;Bodensee&quot;. The name may be linked to that of the Bodanrück, the hill range between Lake Überlingen and the Lower Lake, and the history of the House of Bodman.

The German name of the lake, &quot;Bodensee&quot;, has been adopted by many other languages, for example: Dutch: &quot;Bodenmeer&quot;, Danish: &quot;Bodensøen&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Bodensjøen&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Bodensjön&quot;, Finnish: &quot;Bodenjärvi&quot;, Russian: &quot;Боденское озеро&quot;, Polish: &quot;Jezioro Bodeńskie&quot;, Czech: &quot;Bodamské jezero&quot;, Slovak: &quot;Bodamské jazero&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Bodeni-tó&quot;, Serbo-Croatian: &quot;Bodensko jezero&quot;, Albanian: &quot;Liqeni i Bodenit&quot;.

After the Council of Constance in the 15th century, the alternative name &quot;Lacus Constantinus&quot; was used in the (Roman Catholic) Romance language area. This name, which had been attested as early as 1187 in the form &quot;Lacus Constantiensis&quot;, came from the town of Konstanz at the outflow of the Rhine from the Obersee, whose original name, Constantia, was in turn derived from the Roman emperor, Constantius Chlorus (around 300 AD). Hence the French: &quot;Lac de Constance&quot;, Italian: &quot;Lago di Costanza&quot;, Portuguese: &quot;Lago de Constança&quot;, Spanish: &quot;Lago de Constanza&quot;, Romanian: &quot;Lacul Constanța&quot;, Greek: &quot;Λίμνη της Κωνσταντίας – Limni tis Konstantias&quot;. The Arabic, بحيرة كونستانس &quot;buħaira Konstans&quot; and the Turkish, &quot;Konstanz gölü&quot;, probably go back to the French form of the name. Even in Romance-influenced English the name &quot;Lake Constance&quot; gained a foothold and was then exported into other languages such as Hebrew: ימת קונסטנץ &quot;yamat Konstanz&quot; and Swahili: &quot;Ziwa la Konstanz&quot;. In many languages both forms exist in parallel e.g. Romansh: &quot;Lai da Constanza&quot; and &quot;Lai Bodan&quot;, Esperanto: &quot;Konstanca Lago&quot; and &quot;Bodenlago&quot;.

The poetic name, &quot;Swabian Sea&quot;, was adopted by authors of the early modern era and the Enlightenment from ancient authors, possibly Tacitus. However, this assumption was based on an error (similar to that of the Teutoburg Forest and the Taunus): the Romans sometimes used the name &quot;Mare Suebicum&quot; for the Baltic Sea, not Lake Constance. In times when the Romans had located the so-called &quot;Suebi&quot;, then an Elbe Germanic tribe near a sea, this was understandable. The authors of the Early Modern Period overlooked this and adopted the name for the largest lake in the middle of the former Duchy of Swabia, which also included parts of today&#x27;s Switzerland. Today the name Swabian Sea (&quot;Schwäbisches Meer&quot;) is only used jocularly as a hyperbolic term for Lake Constance.

=== Key facts ===

No Paleolithic finds have been made in the immediate vicinity of the lake, because the region of Lake Constance was long covered by the Rhine Glacier. The discovery of stone tools (microliths) indicate that hunters and gatherers of the Mesolithic period (Middle Stone Age, 8,000–5,500 BC) frequented the area without settling, however. Only hunting camps have been confirmed. The earliest Neolithic farmers, who belonged to the Linear Pottery culture, also left no traces behind, because the Alpine foreland lay away from the routes along which they had spread during the 6th millennium BC. This changed only in the middle and late Neolithic when shore settlements were established, the so-called pile dwelling and wetland settlements, which have now been uncovered mainly on Lake Überlingen, the Constance Hopper and on the Obersee. At Unteruhldingen, a pile dwelling village has been reconstructed, and now forms an open air museum.
In 2015, a 20 km line of about 170 man-made dated in the neolithic period or early Bronze Age was discovered on the south-west shore of the lake between Bottighofen and Romanshorn.

Grave finds from Singen am Hohentwiel date to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age and shore settlements were repeatedly built during the Neolithic Period and the Bronze Age (up to 800 BC). During the following Iron Age the settlement history is interrupted. The settlement of the shore of Lake Constance during the Hallstatt period is attested by grave mounds, which today are usually found in forests where they have been protected from the destruction by agriculture. Since the late Hallstatt period, the peoples living on Lake Constance are referred to as the Celts. During the La Tène period from 450 BC, the population density decreases, as can be deduced partly due from the fact that no more grave mounds were built. For the first time, written reports on Lake Constance have survived. Thus, we learn that the Helvetians settled by the lake in the south, the Rhaetians in the area of the Alpine Rhine Valley and the Vindelici in the north-east. The most important places on the lake were Bregenz (Celtic &quot;Brigantion&quot;) and today&#x27;s Constance.

In the course of the Roman Alpine campaign of 16/15 BC, the Lake Constance region was integrated into the Roman Empire. During the campaign, there was also supposed to have been a battle on Lake Constance. The geographer, Pomponius Mela, makes the first mention in 43 AD of Lake Constance as two lakes – the &quot;Lacus Venetus&quot; (Upper Lake) and the &quot;Lacus Acronius&quot; (Untersee) – with the Rhine flowing through both. Pliny the Elder referred to Lake Constance as &quot;Lacus Brigantinus&quot; for the first time. The most important Roman site was Bregenz, which soon became subject to Roman municipal law and later became the seat of the Prefect of the Lake Constance fleet. The Romans were also in Lindau, but settled only on the hills around Lindau as the lakeshore was swampy. Other Roman towns were &quot;Constantia&quot; (Constance) and &quot;Arbor Felix&quot; (Arbon).

After the borders of the Roman Empire were drawn back to the Rhine boundary in the 3rd century BC, the Alemanni gradually settled on the north shore of Lake Constance and, later, on the south bank as well. After the introduction of Christianity, the cultural significance of the region grew as a result of the founding of Reichenau Abbey and the Bishopric of Constance. Under the rule of the Hohenstaufens, Imperial Diets (&quot;Reichstage&quot;) were held by Lake Constance. In Constance, too, a treaty was drawn up between the Hohenstaufen emperor and the Lombard League. Lake Constance also played an important role as a trading post for goods being traded between German and Italian states.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, there were various conflicts over the control of the region during the Lake War (1632–1648).

After the War of the Second Coalition (1798–1802), which also affected the region and during which Austrian and French flotillas operated on Lake Constance, there was a reorganisation of state relationships.

== Geography ==
=== Divisions ===
Lake Constance is located in the foothills of the Alps. The shore length of both main lakes is long. Of this, are located in Germany (Baden-Württemberg , Bavaria ), run through Austria and through Switzerland. If the upper and lower lakes are combined, Lake Constance has a total area of , the third largest lake in Central Europe by area after Lake Balaton () and Lake Geneva (). It is also the second largest by water volume () after Lake Geneva () and extends for over between Bregenz and Stein am Rhein. Its catchment area is around , and reaching as far south as Lago di Lei in Italy.

The area of the Obersee, or Upper Lake, is . It extends from Bregenz to Bodman-Ludwigshafen for over and is wide between Friedrichshafen and Romanshorn. At its deepest point between Fischbach and Uttwil, it is deep.
The three small bays on the Vorarlberg shore have their own names: the Bay of Bregenz, off Hard and Fußach is the Bay of Fussach and, west of that is the Wetterwinkel. Farther west, now in Switzerland, is the Bay of Rorschach. To the north, on the Bavarian side, is the Bay of Reutin. The railway embankment from the mainland to the island of Lindau and the motorway bridge over the lake border the so-called Little Lake (&quot;Kleiner See&quot;), which is located between the Lindau village of Aeschach and the island.

The northwestern, finger-shaped arm of the Obersee is called Überlinger See (or Überlingersee in Swiss Standard German), or Lake Überlingen. It is sometimes regarded as a separate lake, the boundary between Lake Überlingen and the rest of the Upper Lake runs approximately along the line between the southeast tip of Bodanrück (the &quot;Hörnle&quot;, which belongs to the town of Konstanz) and Meersburg. The Constance Hopper lies between the German and Swiss shores east of Konstanz.

The Obersee and Untersee are connected by the Seerhein.

The Untersee, or Lower Lake, which is separated from the Obersee and from its north-west arm, the Überlinger See, by the large peninsula of Bodanrück, has an area of . It is strongly characterised and divided into different areas by end moraines, various glacial snouts and medial moraines. These various areas of the lake have their own names. North of Reichenau Island is the Gnadensee. West of the island of Reichenau, between the peninsula of Höri and the peninsula of Mettnau is the Zeller See (or Zellersee in Swiss Standard German), or Lake Zell. North of the peninsula and swamp land Mettnau lies the lake part Markelfinger Winkel. The drumlins of the southern Bodanrück continue along the bed of these northern parts of the lake. South of the Reichenau, from Gottlieben to Eschenz, stretches the &quot;Rheinsee&quot; (lit.: &quot;Rhine Lake&quot;) with strong Rhine currents in places. Previously this lake part was named Lake Bernang after the village of Berlingen. On most of the maps the name of the &quot;Rheinsee&quot; is not shown, because this place is best suited for the name of the Untersee.

=== Emergence and future ===
The present-day shape of Lake Constance has resulted from the combination of several factors:
* The tectonic Lake Constance Basin between the Alps and the Jura was created in the Jurassic and Tertiary periods.
* The current Alpine Rhine was initially a tributary of the Danube.
* Over time, the basin was captured by the High Rhine as a result of headward erosion (fluvial erosion).
** The capture was not always only along the present Rhine valley; Lake Überlingen marks part of an older valley course.
* The river valleys were deepened during several cold periods by the Rhine Glacier from the valley of the Alpine Rhine (glacial erosion).
* Behind the present impressive traces of the Würm Ice Age, the effects of older cold periods can no longer be explored in any detail. Lake Constance now represents, above all, a zungenbecken or glacial lake of the Würm Glaciation.
* During a later phase of the ice age, only the Obersee was glaciated. As the glacier retreated further, the glacial meltwaters flowed out of the emerging Überlingen See through the older more northerly valley into the present High Rhine valley.
* Due to the advancing headward erosion, the present course of the High Rhine was finally (again) reconnected to Lake Constance. 

Like any glacial lake, Lake Constance will also silt up by sedimentation. This process can best be observed at the mouths of the larger rivers, especially that of the Alpine Rhine. The silting up process is accelerated by ever-increasing erosion by the Rhine and the associated reduction in the level of the lake.

=== Tributaries ===

The main tributary of Lake Constance is the Alpine Rhine. The Alpine Rhine and the Seerhein do not mix greatly with the waters of the lake and flow through the lakes along courses that change relatively little. There are also numerous smaller tributaries (236 in all). The most important tributaries of the Obersee are (counterclockwise) the Dornbirner Ach, Bregenzer Ach, Leiblach, Argen, Schussen, Rotach, Brunnisach, Seefelder Aach, Stockacher Aach, Salmsacher Aach, the Aach near Arbon, Steinach, Goldach and the Old Rhine. The outflow of the Obersee is the Seerhein, which in turn is the main tributary of the Untersee. The most important tributary of the Untersee is the Radolfzeller Aach. The source of the Radolfzeller Aach is the Aachtopf, a karst spring whose waters mostly derive from the Danube Sinkhole. Therefore, the Danube is indirectly also a tributary of the Rhine.
Because the Alpine Rhine brings with it drift from the mountains and deposits this material as sediment, the Bay of Bregenz will silt up in a few centuries time. The silting up of the entire Lake Constance is estimated to take another ten to twenty thousand years.

=== Outflows, evaporation, water extraction ===
The outflow of the Untersee is the High Rhine with the Rhine Falls at Schaffhausen. Both the average precipitation of 0.45 km3/a and evaporation which averages 0.29 km3/a cause a net change in the level of Lake Constance that is less when compared to the influence of the inflows and outflows. Further quantities of lake water are extracted by municipal waterworks around the lake and the water company of Bodensee-Wasserversorgung.

=== Islands ===

In Lake Constance there are ten islands that are larger than .

By far the largest is the island of Reichenau in the Untersee, which belongs to the municipality of Reichenau. The former abbey of Reichenau is a UNESCO World Heritage Site due to its three early and highly medieval churches. The island is also known for its intensive cultivation of fruit and vegetables.

The island of Lindau is located in the east of the Obersee, and is the second largest island. On it is the old town and main railway station of Lindau.

The third largest island is Mainau in the southeast of Lake Überlingen. The owners, the family of Bernadotte, have set up the island as a tourist attraction and created botanical gardens and wildlife enclosures.

Relatively large, but uninhabited and inaccessible because of their status as nature reserves, are two islands off the Wollmatinger Ried: the Triboldingerbohl which has an area of and Mittler or Langbohl which is just in area.

Smaller islands in the Obersee are:
* Dominican Island (&quot;Dominikanerinsel&quot;) separated by a six-metre-wide ditch from the old town of Constance which is home to the Steigenberger Hotel ()
* The tiny island of Hoy near Lindau
* The ten artificial islands on the Rhine Causeway on the Fußach side
* The little island by the port of Romanshorn
* The Wollschweininsel (officially &quot;Wulesaueninsle&quot;) by the Seepark in Kreuzlingen

In the Untersee are:
* the islands of Werd, Mittleres Werdli and Unteres Werdli which together form the Werd Islands group are located at the outflow of the Rhine from the Untersee at Stein am Rhein into the High Rhine.
* The so-called Liebesinsel (&quot;Love Island&quot;, , southwest of the Mettnau peninsula.

=== Peninsulas ===
In Lake Constance there are several peninsulas which vary greatly in size:
* The Bodanrück, the largest peninsula, separates the Überlinger See (Obersee) from the Untersee. It covers an area of .
* The Mettnau in the Untersee, which extends towards the Island of Reichenau, separates Zeller See in the south from the Markelfinger Winkel in the north. It has a surface area of .
* The Höri, (about 45-square-kilometres) also extends towards the Island of Reichenau, and separates the Zeller See to the north from the Rheinsee to the south.
* In the southeast, near the mouth of the new Rhine Canal, the Rohrspitz juts out about into the lake and forms the western perimeter of the Bay of Fußach. It has an area of about 50 hectares.
* The Wasserburg peninsula has a castle, Schloss Wasserburg, and the parish church of St. George. The peninsula is on the northeastern shore of the Obersee between the Bay of Nonnenhorn in the west and Bay of Wasserburg in the east. It has an area of and was an island until 1720, when the Fuggers built a causeway. In March 2009, 27 people lived on the peninsula.
* The Galgeninsel (&quot;Gallows Island&quot;) in the Bay of Reutin is also a peninsula that was formerly an island. It is only 0.16 hectares in area.

=== Shore ===

The shores of Lake Constance consist mainly of gravel. In some places there are also sandy beaches, such as the Rohrspitz in the Austrian section of the lake, the Langenargen and Marienschlucht.

According to the data of the International Water Protection Commission for the Lake Constance, the approximate shore length is (see Coastline paradox). The inflow of water is constantly changing, mainly due to rain and the snow melt in the Alps. Its average surface area is about (in Switzerland the absolute value is slightly higher in m above sea level). The more or less regular seasonal fluctuations in the water level also lead to slight variations in shore length and differences in the shore zone habitats (depending on high and low water).

=== Transportation ===
==== Road ====
Roads westbound Bundesstraße 33 (B 33, highway), Bundesautobahn 81 (A 81), at Stockach, Konstanz: Bundesautobahn 98 (A 98), Switzerland: Autobahn 7 (A7), Autobahn 1 (A 1), Autobahn 23 (A 23) and eastbound at Bregenz Rheintal/Walgau Autobahn (A 14), at Lindau Bundesautobahn 96 (A 96), Bundesstraße 31 (B 31)

==== Ship / Ferry ====

There are eight main harbors offering boat services across the Upper Lake:

;Austria:
* Bregenz

;Switzerland:
* Rorschach
* Romanshorn

;Germany:
* Lindau
* Friedrichshafen
* Meersburg
* Unteruhldingen (touristic harbor)
* Konstanz

Additionally, car ferries link Romanshorn to Friedrichshafen, and Konstanz to Meersburg. Between 1869 and 1976, there used to be train ferries across the lake.

Several smaller harbors on the Upper Lake offer boat trips along the German or Swiss coast (with one continuing over the Old Rhine to Rheineck).

The harbour in Konstanz is also served by the &quot;Schweizerische Schifffahrtsgesellschaft Untersee und Rhein&quot; (URh), which operates via the &quot;Seerhein&quot;, Lower Lake and High Rhine to Schaffhausen. It docks at the harbours of Kreuzlingen, Konstanz, Gottlieben, Ermatingen, Reichenau, Mannenbach, Berlingen, Gaienhofen, Steckborn, Hemmenhofen, Wangen, Mammern, Öhningen, Stein am Rhein, Diessenhofen, Büsingen and Schaffhausen. Radolfzell and Iznang are also linked by a boat line over the Lower Lake (to Konstanz).

====Rail====
A network of several railway lines surrounds the lake. The lines are operated by regional train services (S-Bahn, RegioExpress, Regional-Express) spreading over four countries (Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland). In Switzerland, they belong to S-Bahn St. Gallen and trains are operated by THURBO (Swiss Federal Railways, SBB), Südostbahn (SOB) and Appenzell Railways (AB). The so-called belt railway () along the northern shore is operated by DB Regio and SBB GmbH. In Austria and Liechtenstein, train services are operated by Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) for the Vorarlberg S-Bahn. Regional train services around Lake Constance are marketed as Bodensee S-Bahn.

Railway stations close to harbours are, among others: , , , , , , and .

Long-distance trains (RJ/RJX, EC/ECE, IC (DB)/IC (SBB), IR, IRE) link larger lakeside railway stations (e.g., , , , , ) with major cities.

====Air====
Two airports are located near the lake&#x27;s shores: Friedrichshafen Airport (Germany) and St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport (Switzerland). Zeppelin NT offers touristic zeppelin flights around Lake Constance departing from Friedrichshafen Airport.

=== Climate ===

The climate of the Lake Constance area is characterised by mild temperatures with moderate gradients, thanks to the balancing and retarding effect of the large body of water. 

It has a subtropical microclimate, which allows the cultivation of some exotic fruits and trees. Constance counts 2069 sunshine hours a year and is therefore considered one of the sunniest cities in Germany.

Winters are generally short and mild, although night temperatures can fall under 0°C, especially from December to February. Typically day temperatures range between +5 and +12°C, while nights with +1 to +8°C on average stay cold, though mostly without long and severe frosts.

The Föhn, a warm wind from the Mediterranean Sea, that regularly blows through the Alps, can cause temperatures between 15 and 20°C with sunshine for several days, while on the other hand fog creates a few cold days between 1 and 5°C each year. Generally, Lake Constance is affected more by fog than neighboring regions more inland. 

Spring goes from March to May and is usually sunny, with day temperatures between 15 and 22°C but still relatively cold water. This is also resulting in still cold night temperatures that range between 4°C in March and 12°C in May only. 

As the lake temperature heats up by the increasing warm days, the nights are also becoming milder, though moderated a little bit by the height and lake. This results in average morning lows of 16-18°C during the high summer months. Lake Constance counts one of the highest amount of tropical nights in Germany (lowest temperature at 20°C or more). 

The days in Summers (June-September) are warm to hot with day temperatures of 26-33°C on average, decreasing to around 20°C until the end of September. Humidity levels raise noticeable and temperatures often move up to 35°C between June and August. This increases the heat index, causing Lake Constance to have a stressful climate.

The region receives most of its sunny days during high summer. In the recent years, in 2018 and 2022, the water levels fall to new record lows due to weeks without significant rain. On the other hand, the closeness to the Alps can cause thunderstorms in the evenings that sometimes occur out of nowhere.

While the official bathing season ends in September, the average lake temperature stays around 20°C until October. Autumn is generally the time when Lake Constance starts to experience more foggy mornings again, but the day temperatures still range between 21 in the beginning and 10-12°C at the end of the season. Night temperatures fall from 13°C in September to an average of 5°C in November.

Lake Constance is one of the best known wine growing regions in Germany and experiences several outdoor events during harvest time in autumn. 

Lake Constance is also considered to be a risky and challenging lake for water sports because of the danger of gusty winds which can whip up waves as the weather changes suddenly. The most dangerous wind is the föhn, a warm down-slope wind from the Alps, which spreads out across the water, especially through the Alpine Rhine Valley and can generate waves several metres high.

Similarly dangerous for those unfamiliar with the area, are the sudden stormy gusts of wind during summer thunderstorms. They constantly claim victims from the water sports fraternity. During a thunderstorm in July 2006, waves reached heights of up to 3.50 metres.

For these reasons, there is a storm warning system in all three neighbouring countries. For storm warning purposes, Lake Constance is divided into three warning regions (west, centre and east). Warnings can be issued for each region independently. A &quot;high winds&quot; warning will be issued when squalls are expected of between 25 and 33 knots or registering force 6 to 8 on the Beaufort scale. A gale warning announces the likelihood of gale-force winds, i.e. those at speeds as of 34 knots or more or force 8 on the Beaufort scale. In order to issue these warnings, orange-coloured flashing lights are installed around the lake, which flash at a frequency of 40 times per minute for high winds or 90 times per minute for gales. It can happen that, due to the differently regulated responsibilities and assessments, a gale warning is issued on the Swiss side of the Obersee, but not on the German or Austrian shores, and vice versa. Ships and ferries on Lake Constance indicate a gale warning by hoisting a &quot;Sturmballon&quot; (&quot;storm ball&quot;) up the mast.

==== Freeze over ====
A one-hundred year event is the freezing over of Lake Constance, when the Lower Lake and the Upper Lake are completely frozen over so that people can safely cross the lake on foot. The last so-called &quot;Seegfrörne&quot; (Alemannic) event was in 1963. The following is a list of years in which Lake Constance froze over partially or completely:

*875, 895
*1074, 1076
*1108
*1217, 1227, 1277
*1323, 1325, 1378, 1379, 1383
*1409, 1431, 1435 (complete), 1460, 1465, 1470, 1479
*1512, 1517, 1553, 1560 (complete), 1564, 1565, 1571, 1573 (complete)
*1684, 1695 (complete)
*1788, 1796 (complete)
*1830 (complete), 1880 (complete)
*1929, 1963 (complete)

Certain parts of the lake freeze over more frequently, mainly due to their shallow depth of water and shelter, as is the case, for example, of the so-called Markelfinger Winkel between the municipality of Markelfingen and the Mettnau peninsula.

==== Floods ====
* A 100-year flood around June 1999 (Pfingsthochwasser 1999) raised the level about 2 metres above normal, flooding harbors and many shoreline buildings and hotels.
* In late August 2005, heavy rain raised the level by more than in a few days. The rains caused widespread flooding and washed out highways and railroads.
* Frequent rainfall and snowmelt in the summer of 2024 raised water levels to above normal level.

=== International borders ===

The lake lies where the countries of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland meet. Beyond areas less than deep, considered to be under the jurisdiction of the nearest country, there is no legally binding agreement as to where the borders lie between the three countries. However, Switzerland holds the view that the border runs through the middle of the lake, Austria is of the opinion that the contentious area belongs to all the states on its banks, which is known as a &quot;condominium&quot;, and Germany holds an ambiguous opinion. Legal questions pertaining to ship transport and fishing are regulated in separate treaties.

Disputes occasionally arise. One concerns a houseboat which was moored in two states (ECJ c. 224/97 Erich Ciola); another concerns the rights to fish in the Bay of Bregenz. In relation to the latter, an Austrian family was of the opinion that it alone had the right to fish in broad portions of the bay. However, this was accepted neither by the Austrian courts nor by the organs and courts of the other states.

== Ecology ==
=== Flora ===
Until the 19th century, Lake Constance was a natural lake. Since then, nature has been heavily influenced by clearing and the cultivation of much of the land around its shores. However, some near-natural areas have been largely conserved, especially in the nature reserves, or were re-naturalised. As a result, the Lake Constance region has some unusual ecological features. These include the large forested area on the Bodanrück, the occurrence of marsh gentian and orchids of the genera &quot;Dactylorhiza&quot; and &quot;Orchis&quot; in the Wollmatinger Ried, and the Siberian iris (&quot;Iris sibirica&quot;) in the Eriskircher Ried, which was therefore given its own name. One unique species among the local flora is the Lake Constance forget-me-not (&quot;Myosotis rehsteineri&quot;), whose habitat is restricted to undisturbed limestone gravel beaches.

=== Fauna ===
==== Birds ====

Lake Constance is also the home of numerous bird species, many of which nest in its nature reserves, such as the Wollmatinger Ried or the Mettnau peninsula. 412 species have so far been recorded.

===== Songbirds =====
The ten most common breeding bird species at Lake Constance according to a 2000–2003 survey in descending order are the: blackbird, chaffinch, house sparrow, great tit, blackcap, starling, robin, chiffchaff, greenfinch, and blue tit.

===== Waterfowl =====

In spring, the Lake Constance is an important breeding ground, especially for the coot and great crested grebe. Typical waterfowl include the: shoveler, goldeneye, goosander, pochard, grey heron, pintail, tufted duck and mallard.

In December 2014, 1,389 cormorant were counted. The International Lake Constance Fishery Association (IBF) estimates the food requirements of the cormorants on Lake Constance at 150 tonnes of fish annually.

===== Overwintering =====
Lake Constance is an important overwintering area for around 250,000 birds. annually. Bird species such as the dunlin, the curlew and the lapwing overwinter at Lake Constance. In the middle of December 2014 there were 56,798 heron, 51,713 coot and 43,938 pochard. In November/December are about 10,000 to 15,000 red-crested pochard and 10,000 great crested grebe on Lake Constance.

===== Migration =====
During migration in late autumn there are also numerous loons on the lake (black-throated and red-throated loon, as well as a few great northern loons). Lake Constance is also very important as a staging post during the bird migration. Bird migration is often inconspicuous and most noticeable when there are special weather conditions that make day migration obvious. Only where there is a prolonged spell of widespread low-pressure is it common to observe the congestion of large groups of migratory birds. This can often be observed in autumn on the Eriskircher Ried on the northern shore of Lake Constance. This is where broad front migration converges on the lake and birds then try to move along the shore towards the northwest. The importance of Lake Constance as an important area for resting and overwintering is underlined by the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology&#x27;s Radolfzell Bird Observatory (&quot;Vogelwarte Radolfzell&quot;), which is the bird ringing centre for the German states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and the Saarland as well as for Austria, and which researches bird migration.

==== Fish ====
Around 45 species of fish live in Lake Constance. The annual haul from fishing is 1.5 million kg. Unusual species occurring here considering the location of the lake are the whitefish (&quot;Coregonus&quot; spec.) and the Arctic char (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;). Fish that are important for the fishing industry are:
* Bodenseefelchen (German: also &quot;Blaufelchen&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Coregonus wartmanni&quot;)
* Sandfelchen (German: also &quot;Weißfelchen&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Coregonus arenicolus&quot;)
* Gangfisch (Lat.: &quot;Coregonus macrophthalmus&quot;)
* Lake Constance whitefish (German: &quot;Kilch&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Coregonus gutturosus&quot;)
* Grayling (German: &quot;Äsche&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Thymallus thymallus&quot;)
* Perch (German: &quot;Flussbarsch, Kretzer, Barschling,&quot; Swiss German: &quot;Egli&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;)
* Bream (German: &quot;Brachse&quot;, &quot;Brasse&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Abramis brama&quot;)
* Northern pike (German: &quot;Hecht&quot; (Lat.: &quot;Esox lucius&quot;)
* Zander (Lat.: &quot;Sander lucioperca&quot;)
* Burbot (German: &quot;Quappe&quot;, &quot;Trüsche&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Lota lota&quot;)
* Eel (German: &quot;Aal&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;)
* Bullhead (German: &quot;Groppe&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Cottus gobio&quot;)
* Tench (German: &quot;Schleie&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Tinca tinca&quot;)
* Wels catfish (German: &quot;Wels&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Silurus glanis&quot;)
* Lake trout (German: &quot;Seeforelle&quot;, Lat.: &quot;Salmo trutta lacustris&quot;)

The Bodenseefelchen (&quot;Coregonus wartmanni&quot;), which was named after Lake Constance due to the great numbers found there, is often prepared whole or as a fillet, in the style of the miller&#x27;s wife (&quot;nach Müllerin Art&quot;), in local fish restaurants in a similar way to other trout It is also often served smoked.

Two endemic species are known to have existed only in Lake Constance, the Bodensee-Kilch (&quot;Coregonus gutturosus&quot;) and deepwater char (&quot;Salvelinus profundus&quot;). The former is now assumed to be extinct, while the latter was feared extinct for decades until its rediscovery in the 2010s.

==== Introduced species ====
For many years non-native species have settled in the Lake Constance ecosystem and, in some cases, endangered or threatened native flora and fauna. At Lake Constance, non-native species have been increasing annually. Several have been transported from other waterbodies as &#x27;stowaways&#x27; on the outside of boats, life jackets, anchor chains or ropes or diving gear. Others have immigrated from the Black Sea or the Danube since the opening of the Main-Danube Canal. Others have been deliberately introduced.

===== Well-known non-native species =====
Even the rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) is not a native fish. It was introduced into Lake Constance around 1880 for economic reasons to enhance the local fauna.

Among the foreign species of animal in Lake Constance are the zebra mussel (&quot;Dreissena polymorpha&quot;) which, since the 18th century, has spread from the Black Sea region across most of Europe and was carried into Lake Constance between 1960 and 1965. After a huge increase in numbers during the 1980s in the Rhine and large lakes, this species is now in retreat today. The zebra mussel causes problems because, among other things, it blocks water extraction pipes. In addition, the species can be a disaster for domestic shellfish, because it competes for their food. Today, according to the Institute for Lake Research (&quot;Institut für Seenforschung&quot;, ISF), the zebra mussel is also an important food for overwintering waterfowl. In fact, the number of overwinterers has more than doubled in around 30 years.

The killer shrimp (&quot;Dikerogammarus villosus&quot;) has spread since 2002 from two sections of shoreline near Hagnau and Immenstaad, over the whole Lake Überlingen (2004), the whole of the Upper Lake (2006) and almost the whole Lake Constance and Rheinsee shore (2007). As its name implies, it is a voracious burglar of fish larvae and fish eggs.

The most recent example is the little opossum shrimp (&quot;Limnomysis benedeni&quot;), only six to eleven millimeters long, which was found in 2006 in the Vorarlberg region of Hard, and can now be found almost all over Lake Constance. It comes from the waters around the Black Sea. It was presumably first transported by ships up the Danube before it spread into the Rhine river system and entered Lake Constance. The opossum shrimp, which occurs in many places in shoals of several million in winter, are already an influential link in the food chain in Lake Constance. They consume dead animal and plant material as well as phytoplankton, but are also eaten by fish themselves.

Today, in western Lake Constance are found: the North American spinycheek crayfish (&quot;Orconectes limosus&quot;), which was introduced into European waters in the mid-19th century to increase the yield, occasionally the Chinese mitten crab (&quot;Eriocheir sinensis&quot;), and in the lake&#x27;s tributaries, the signal crayfish (&quot;Pacifastacus leniusulus&quot;). As these species of large crayfish are immune to crayfish plague, but spread the pathogen, they are a great danger to native species such as noble crayfish, white-clawed crayfish or stone crayfish. The animals are often undemanding, multiply rapidly and lead predatory lives, thus also posing a threat to various small species of fish. The ISF has been systematically researching the subject since 2003.

=== Wrecks on the lake bed ===

After a collision with the &quot;Stadt Zürich&quot; in 1864 the wreck of the &quot;Jura&quot; has lain on the lake bed at a depth of 45 metres off the Swiss shore. In the early 20th century four ships were sunk in the Obersee after being taken out of service: in 1931 the &quot;Baden&quot;, formerly the &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm&quot;, in 1932 the &quot;Helvetia&quot;, in 1933 the &quot;Säntis&quot; and in 1934 the &quot;Stadt Radolfzell&quot;. The hull of the burnt-out &quot;Friedrichshafen&quot; was scuttled in 1944 off the mouth of the Argen in 100 to 150 metres of water.

== Tourism, leisure and sports ==
The tourism and leisure industry is important for this region. Overnight stays reached 17,56m visitors in 2012 with a turnover of about 1.9bn Euros. The same amount comes from the 70 million visitors that visit Lake Constance each year.

This region is known for sightseeing, water-sports, winter-sports like Skiing, summer-sports like Swimming (sport), Sailing and recreation. It is also one of the few places where modern Zeppelin airships operate and 12–14 people can take a trip above the lake around various points of interest.

In cooperation with tourism service providers, tourism organizations and public institutions in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the International Bodensee Tourismus GmbH (IBT GmbH) is responsible for the tourism marketing of the Lake Constance region.
=== Sights and cultural heritage ===
The lake and the region around it have a substantial touristic infrastructure as well as many attractions and points of interests. Important are especially towns like Konstanz, Überlingen, Meersburg, Friedrichshafen, Lindau, Romanshorn, Rorschach and Bregenz as they are the big hubs for boating tourism and lake crossing ferries. The main tourism attractions are places like Rhine Falls, one of the three biggest waterfalls in Europe (located near Schaffhausen), the islands of Mainau, Lindau and Reichenau (UNESCO world heritage), the pilgrimage church Birnau, castles and palaces like Salem Abbey, Meersburg Castle as well as another UNESCO world heritage site, the Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen (German for Stilt house museum), Zeppelin Museum Friedrichshafen as well as the Church of St. George, Oberzell, Reichenau or the &quot;Rheinschauen&quot; heritage railway.

==== Overlooks ====
High mountain ranges are mainly located near the southeastern shore of the Upper Lake (&quot;Obersee&quot;). The lower foothills of the Appenzell Alps in Switzerland are accessible by bus routes and two railway lines: the Rorschach–Heiden railway between / near the lake shore and , and the Rheineck–Walzenhausen mountain railway between and . Both lines are operated by Appenzell Railways and part of St. Gallen S-Bahn and Bodensee S-Bahn, respectively. A popular overlook near Heiden is &quot;Fünfländerblick&quot; (). In Austria, the Pfänderbahn, an aerial tram, takes passengers from the valley station near to the top station on Pfänder mountain (Allgäu Alps).

The Hegau region adjacent to Lower Lake Constance (&quot;Untersee&quot;) contains several higher mountains of volcanic origin, many with ruins of fortresses on their tops (e.g. Hohenkrähen, Mägdeberg). The southernly located of these Hegau volcanoes (e.g. Hohentwiel) also offer a view over the lakes.

=== Cultural events ===
Lake Constance is the location for the annual Bregenzer Festspiele, a well-known arts festival that, among other venues, takes place on a floating stage in Bregenz. The operas, plays and concerts performed are usually popular works, e.g. &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart or &quot;Rigoletto&quot; by Giuseppe Verdi.

Since 2001, the ART BODENSEE takes place in Dornbirn. It is an annual meeting point for the exchange between collectors, artists and art appreciators.

=== Biking ===
Biking around the lake is also possible on the long trail called &quot;Bodensee-Radweg&quot;. It brings its visitors to the most interesting sites and goes around the whole lake. Nevertheless, various shortcuts via ferries allow shorter routes and the trail is suitable for all levels. Note: There is also a trail that goes by the name &quot;Bodensee-Rundweg&quot;. This road was intended for pedestrians so biking is sometimes not suitable or allowed.

=== Hiking and pilgrim trails ===

The 260 kilometers long Lake Constance circular route, signposted as &quot;Bodensee Rundwanderweg&quot;, leads around Lake Constance through the territories of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. It is mainly intended for hiking; cyclists follow the sometimes slightly different managed Lake Constance cycle path. The trail can be walked in smaller stages of various lengths and offers nice views of the lake, landscape and wildlife. However, due to industrial settlements, buildings and nature reserves, not all the coastal zones are readily accessible. Furthermore, in the estuary of the rivers, such the Leiblach, Bregenzer Ach, canalized Rhine and Old Rhine (Fußacher breakthrough), considerable distances have to be covered inland to the next bridge or river crossing point. Due to busy riverside roads, the Bodensee-Rundweg sometimes runs as a trail above the lake with some lookout possibilities.

Lake Constance is also a hub for long-distance hikers and pilgrims. It has been a crucial reference point of important pilgrimage routes since ancient times:
* Via Beuronensis, a Way of St. James from the Neckar region over the Swabian Alb
* the Upper Swabian pilgrimage-route of St. James, which leads from Upper Swabia to the lake and branches north of the lake both in the direction of Nonnenhorn and in the direction of Meersburg
* the Bavarian-Swabian route of St. James, which leads down from the West Allgäu to the lake

Swimming in the lake is usually best from mid-June to mid-September. Depending on the weather and exact location, the water temperatures reach . Within one day, differences of up to are possible with appropriate sunlight, so that the lake invites to swim, especially on warm summer evenings.

=== Diving ===

Diving in Lake Constance is considered attractive and challenging. Most of the diving areas are located in the northern part of the lake (Überlingen, Ludwigshafen, Marienschlucht and others), a few also in the south. The areas should be dived exclusively by experienced divers under the guidance of one of the local diving schools or a seasoned diver. Diving at some spots like the devils table (&quot;Teufelstisch&quot;) called rock needle in the lake in front of the Marienschlucht, is only allowed after approval by the district office Konstanz.

A famous freshwater wreck in Europe is the paddle steamer Jura, which lies in front of Bottighofen at a depth of . The canton of Thurgau, the office for archaeology in Frauenfeld, has placed the Jura under protection as an underwater industrial monument.

For all divers, the water in Lake Constance—even in summer—is already below from a depth of which requires suitable cold-water regulators that do not freeze at such temperatures.

=== Boating, recreational boating ===

Pleasure boating is important. At the beginning of 2011, 57,875 amusement vehicles were registered for Lake Constance.

The legal basis for all shipping on the lake is the ordinance on shipping on Lake Constance, or &quot;Bodensee-Schifffahrtsordnung&quot;. It is monitored on Lake Constance and on the Upper Rhine by the German, Swiss and Austrian Water Police, the &quot;Seepolizei&quot;.

All boats must be registered, and boat drivers must hold a &quot;Bodenseeschifferpatent&quot; (authorization to drive a patented vehicle on Lake Constance). It is issued in Germany by the shipping offices of the district of Constance, the Lake Constance district, and the district of Lindau; in Switzerland by the cantonal authorities; and in Austria by the District Commission Bregenz. For pleasure boaters short-term guest licenses are possible (for the categories A for motorboats over 4.4 kW and D for sailboats over 12 m2 sail area).

Boating events
* Since 1979, every year to the assumption of Mary, Europe&#x27;s largest ship procession is held on Lake Constance. 
* Every year (early summer) the spectacular all-around (&quot;Rund-um&quot;) Regatta from Lindau to Lindau via Meersburg, Überlingen, Romanshorn is organized. 
* Since 2009, the annual water sports and sailing festival &quot;International Lake Constanze week&quot;, a joint sports event takes place in Konstanz. 
* In Friedrichshafen, one of the most important water sports fairs in Europe, the Interboot, takes place annually.

== Fishing ==
The lake was frozen in the years 1077 (?), 1326 (partial), 1378 (partial), 1435, 1465 (partial), 1477 (partial), 1491 (partial?), 1517 (partial), 1571 (partial), 1573, 1600 (partial), 1684, 1695, 1709 (partial), 1795, 1830, 1880 (partial), and 1963.

About of fish were caught by 150 professional fishermen in 2001 which was below the previous ten-year average of per year. The Lake Constance trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot;) was almost extinct in the 1980s due to pollution, but thanks to protective measures they have made a significant return. Lake Constance is the home of the critically endangered species of trout &quot;Salvelinus profundus&quot;, and formerly also the now extinct Lake Constance whitefish (&quot;Coregonus gutturosus&quot;).

<doc id="76275" wikidata="Q466985" url="?curid=76275" title="Thalys">
<text>Thalys (French: ) was a brand name used for high-speed train services between Paris Gare du Nord and both Amsterdam Centraal and German cities in the Rhein-Ruhr, including Aachen, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Essen and Dortmund, both via Brussels-South.

Thalys was created out of a political ambition formalised in October 1987 to establish a network of international high-speed railway services between the cities of Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam. The Thalys name was created in January 1995. The company procured a fleet of Alstom-built TGV trains to operate its services as they were viewed as the only existing rolling stock suitable to the task.

On 4 June 1996, the first Thalys-branded train departed from Paris. Early services were more reliant on slower conventional lines as many of the intended new high-speed lines were still under construction. Service speeds would improve with the opening of Belgium&#x27;s HSL 1 line in December 1997 and the Dutch HSL-Zuid in December 2009, alongside other infrastructure works. Thalys&#x27;s busiest route was the Paris–Belgium corridor; various airlines, such as Air France and KLM, opted to discontinue flights directly competing with Thalys&#x27;s high speed services.

From 1996 to April 2022, the service was managed by Thalys International, which was 70% owned by the French national railway company SNCF and 30% owned by the Belgian national railway company NMBS/SNCB. It was operated by THI Factory, which was 60% owned by SNCF and 40% owned by NMBS/SNCB. Between 2007 and 2013, the German national railway company had also held a 10% stake in the company.

On 30 March 2015, Thalys was restructured as a conventional train operating company, becoming less reliant on SNCF and NMBS/SNCB. During September 2019, a plan was announced to merge Thalys and the cross-Channel high-speed train operator Eurostar. Approval of the merger was issued by the European Commission on 28 March 2022. In February 2022, Thalys International was integrated into THI Factory, which in turn was acquired by the holding company Eurostar Group during the following month. From April 2022 to September 2023, Thalys services were operated by the Eurostar Group. Since 29 September 2023, the services operate under the Eurostar name; sometimes referred to as Eurostar Red, based on the colour of the trains.

==History==
===Background and establishment===

Prior to the creation of Thalys, an express rail service had long been operated between the capital cities of Paris and Brussels, the earliest being run in 1924 in the form of the train service l&#x27;Étoile du Nord. By the 1970s, the conventional service connecting the two cities had a journey time of around two hours and 30 minutes. In the following decade, interest in an international high-speed train service along a similar route was gaining traction amongst various governments.

During October 1987, the political decision to create a network of high-speed services between the cities of Paris, Brussels, Cologne, and Amsterdam was made in Brussels. However, in 1991, the Dutch parliament initially rejected the project; continued discussions led to an agreement being reached with Belgium for a route via Breda instead of Roosendaal. The building of the HSL-Zuid high speed line in the Netherlands was finally approved in 1996. Meanwhile, Germany decided against the construction of a new railway between Aachen and Cologne, instead opting to renovate the existing track between Duren and Cologne, which resulted in a top speed of 250 kilometres per hour along this section. On 28 January 1993, SNCF, SNCB/NMBS, and (which became part of in 1994) signed an agreement to operate the axis on a joint basis.

During January 1995, &quot;Westrail International&quot; was created by the French and Belgian national railways to operate the new international services. That same month, both the logo and brand of &quot;Thalys&quot; were also created; the word deliberately lacked any particular meaning, save for being pronounceable in the languages of all the countries served. It was decided to procure Alstom-built TGV trains, similar to those already used by SNCF on the French national railways, as these were the only suitable rolling stock available at the time. Another key decision was to launch the service in advance of many of the planned high speed lines, being initially reliant upon slower conventional lines until these were eventually completed; the existing international services that used conventional rolling stock were deliberately withdrawn in preparation for the running of Thalys trains in early June 1996.

On 4 June 1996, the first Thalys-branded train departed Paris, this maiden journey took two hours and seven minutes to reach to Brussels, and four hours and 47 minutes to arrive in Amsterdam. Initially, Thalys services only operated four times per day to Amsterdam and Cologne, while a far greater volume were run between Paris and Belgium. While quite restricted early on, the number of Thalys services would be gradually expanded over time, as would the high speed network that supported it.

===Changes and improvements===

During December 1997, the Belgian HSL 1 line, allowing and running from the French border to the outskirts of Brussels, was inaugurated. On 14 December 1997, the first Thalys train from Paris to Brussels ran on the HSL 1, reducing travel time to 1:25 hours. At the same time, service commenced to Cologne and Aachen in Germany, and Bruges, Charleroi, Ghent, Mons, Namur and Ostend in Belgium. On 19 December 1998, the Thalys Neige service started to the ski resorts of Tarentaise Valley and Bourg-Saint-Maurice. In May 1999, the new high-speed line serving Charles de Gaulle Airport opened, and Thalys started direct services from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Brussels, including codeshare agreements with Air France, American Airlines and Northwest Airlines. On 28 November 1999, Westrail International changed its name to Thalys International.

In 2000, Thalys started a daily service between Brussels and Geneva. With its (French for &#x27;Thalys Sun&#x27;), it started offering direct connections to Provence, initially to Valence, and extended to Avignon and Marseille in 2002. Service between Brussels and Cologne was improved in December 2002 when trains began running on the new HSL 2 in Belgium. During 2003, Thalys services started to Brussels Airport and the Thalys Nuits d&#x27;Été service to Marne-la-Vallée. In 2007, Deutsche Bahn purchased a 10% shareholding, while SNCF reduced its stake to 62% and SNCB to 28%.

Beginning on 14 June 2009, the journey between Brussels and Cologne was shortened by 19 minutes when the new high-speed line HSL 3 between Liège and Aachen opened using Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s thrice-daily ICE trains running between Brussels and Frankfurt. While HSL 3 was completed during 2007, Thalys trains had not been initially equipped with the European Train Control System (ETCS) signaling equipment necessary to use the new line. Following the completion of installation and testing work, Thalys began operating on HSL 3 on 13 December 2009. For the same reasons, Thalys started operating on the HSL 4/HSL-Zuid high-speed line between Antwerp and Amsterdam on 13 December 2009, two years after the line&#x27;s construction.

Since 29 August 2011, one return journey to Cologne has been extended to Essen Hauptbahnhof, and since 30 October 2011, one return journey to Brussels had been extended to Brussels National Airport.

On 9 June 2013, permanently ceased the sale of tickets for Thalys services, forcing affected travellers to purchase separate tickets. The company also opted to sell its 10 per cent shareholding in Thalys, marking a general parting of ways between the two operators.

Since the winter 2013 schedule, Thalys has operated services stopping at Düsseldorf Airport station. On 12 April 2014, it launched a regular service between Lille Europe and Amsterdam Centraal.

At the end of March 2015, Thalys dropped the Paris – Oostende and the Paris – Brussels – Mons – Charleroi – Namur – Liège routes; this withdrawal was reportedly due to a lack of funding from the Belgian government.

On 30 March 2015, Thalys was restructured as a conventional train operating company, adopting the name &quot;THI Factory&quot;, and has since operated under its own train operator certificate. Prior to this date, the ownership of Thalys&#x27;s 26 multi-voltage TGVs had been divided between the four national railway operators holding stakes in the company; they were transferred to the company at this point. These changes were promoted as making Thalys a truly independent company, reducing its interactions with both SNCF and SNCB; headquarters were established in Brussels, with a branch office in Paris.

On 21 March 2016, services in Germany were extended to Dortmund.

In March 2018, Thalys ceased all its operations from Lille-Europe, citing disappointing demand (despite lower-than-average ticket prices) and financial results.

===Merger with Eurostar===
In September 2019, the shareholders of the cross-Channel high speed train operator Eurostar and Thalys introduced a plan to merge the two companies, named project &quot;Green Speed&quot;. Both companies already operate in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with Eurostar also operating in the United Kingdom, and Thalys also operating in Germany, while SNCF already held a majority stake in both operators. The project was promoted as reducing costs and providing a more seamless experience to passengers via the use of a single ticketing system and loyalty program.

During September 2020, the merger between Thalys and Eurostar International was confirmed, In October 2021, it was announced that, upon the completion of the merger, it was intended for all of Thalys&#x27;s services to be rebranded as Eurostar. On 28 March 2022, the European Commission approved the merger. The rebranding of Thalys services commenced in the autumn of 2023, and is planned to be completed by early in 2024. All services of the Eurostar brand will carry a common Eurostar logo, but with the cross-channel trains retaining their dark blue livery, and Thalys&#x27;s rolling stock retaining its deep red livery. In April 2022, THI Factory was acquired by a new holding company, Eurostar Group; its former shareholders received a corresponding stake in the new holding company.

The change of logo on the trains took time to complete; during a transition period, some PBA/PBKA trains with the new &quot;Eurostar&quot; logo could be seen together with others still wearing the older &quot;Thalys&quot; logo.

==Routes==

Beyond Brussels, the main cities Thalys trains reached are Antwerp, Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Liège, Aachen and Cologne. Trains to these destinations ran partly on dedicated high-speed tracks, and partly on conventional tracks shared with normal-speed trains. The high-speed lines formerly used by Thalys are HSL 1 between Paris and Brussels, HSL 4/HSL-Zuid between Antwerp and Amsterdam, and the HSL 2 and HSL 3 between Brussels and Aachen. For its seasonal operations within France, other high-speed lines were used.

Journeys from Brussels (Brussels-South) to Paris (&quot;Gare du Nord&quot;) are normally 1 hour and 22 minutes, for a distance of approximately . The peak service speed is while travelling a dedicated high-speed railway track, which is typically electrified at 25 kV AC by an overhead line.

The &quot;ligne à grande vitesse&quot; (LGV) link with Charles de Gaulle Airport allowed Air France to withdraw its air service between Paris and Brussels; instead, Air France transfers connecting passengers onto Thalys trains. Thalys has been given the IATA designator 2H. This is used in conjunction with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines. American Airlines has a code-sharing agreement with Thalys for rail service from Charles de Gaulle airport to Brussels-South. The airline alliance SkyTeam also has a code-sharing agreement with Thalys for rail service connecting its hub Amsterdam Schiphol Airport with Antwerp-Centraal and Bruxelles Midi/Brussel Zuid. Thalys and the Dutch flagcarrier KLM jointly collaborate on &quot;AirRail&quot;, an initiative to encourage passengers to travel by train to connect with KLM flights; this effort led to KLM reducing air services between Brussels and Amsterdam.

== Market ==

Thalys targets a passenger market in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany.

The percentage of income coming from different routes demonstrates on which routes the company is most used:
* Paris-Brussels: 55.6%
* Paris-Belgium (outside Brussels): 8.9%
* Paris-Belgium-Netherlands: 21.3%
* Paris-Belgium-Germany: 11.8%
* Others: 2.4%

52% of customers are from the leisure market, while 48% are from the business market. A large segment of Thalys&#x27;s total sales and income comes from the connection between Paris and Brussels.

Unlike many national train companies, Thalys does not allow children below 12 years old to travel alone. Children onboard Thalys services must be accompanied and possess appropriate travel documents as required by the relevant national authorities pertaining to the journey being made.

Since 24 August 2010, there has been a supplement of €7 to Thalys (as well as other international high-speed tickets) tickets bought at SNCB/NMBS ticket offices at train stations (but not on tickets bought over the Internet). This is due to a reduction of a sales fee paid by Thalys and Eurostar to the Belgian rail company. The sales prices have evolved, by June 2019, the &quot;booking fee&quot; (as it is referred to as) had risen to €9.


=== Accessibility ===
Thalys trains are wheelchair-accessible, with the assistance of the train staff. Bicycles are not allowed on Thalys unless disassembled or packed in a special wrap. Folding bikes are allowed.

In February 2020, Thalys announced that its new first-and-last mile travel service &#x27;My Driver by Thalys&#x27;s enables passengers can choose between around 50 local taxi fleets to complete their rail journeys.

=== Thalys Lounge ===
Thalys operates station lounges in Brussels and Paris. Opened on 9 July 2015, the newest lounge in Paris&#x27; Gare du Nord, located on 
, offers travelers with a valid &quot;My Thalys World&quot; membership (Thalys&#x27;s loyalty program) a variety of services, including free WiFi and a luggage storage service. For business travelers, a fully equipped meeting room is available for up to six people.

==Rolling stock==
Thalys uses two models of trains, both of which are part of the TGV (&quot;train à grande vitesse&quot;) family of high-speed trains built by Alstom in France.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On 9 May 1998, a truck was struck by a Thalys PBKA on an unprotected level crossing; it had attempted to cross the tracks at the crossing when the train arrived. The truck driver was killed in the impact and the train&#x27;s power unit and first two passenger carriages derailed; the trainset was left heavily damaged. Six passengers were injured and the tracks and catenary were broken in the incident. Passenger carriages R1 and R2 had to be scrapped. The trainset was later repaired with the R1 and R2 carriages from a regular TGV trainset.

* On 11 October 2008, a Thalys PBA set bound for Amsterdam collided with a national ICM train set at Gouda railway station in the Netherlands. The Thalys train set had been diverted via Gouda due to engineering work on its usual route. None of the passengers were seriously injured, but both trains incurred serious damage. An investigation concluded that staff of the ICM train was to blame, as they left the station while still under a red signal.

* On 21 August 2015, a gunman attacked passengers on an Amsterdam–Paris train near Arras. The incident was treated as a terrorist attack. Three passengers along with the gunman received non-fatal injuries.

<text>Disneyland Paris is an entertainment resort in Marne-la-Vallée, France, located about east of Paris. It encompasses two theme parks, seven Disney-owned hotels, two convention centers, a golf course, an arena, and a shopping, dining and entertainment complex. Opened on 12 April 1992, the resort is operated by Disney Experiences, a division of the Walt Disney Company. 

It is the second Disney park outside the United States, following the opening of the Tokyo Disney Resort in 1983, and the largest. Disneyland Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be completely owned by the company. Disneyland Park, opened in 1992, is the original theme park of the complex. A second theme park, Walt Disney Studios Park, opened in 2002. 

The resort is located on approximately of land which is being developed under a master agreement with French governmental authorities. About half of the land has been developed, including a planned community, Val d&#x27;Europe. 

Disneyland Paris is Europe&#x27;s most-visited theme park, and the largest single-site employer in France with 17,000 employees. It generated $343 million in profit for Disney in 2023. By 2022, 375 million people had visited the park.

==Ownership==
The Walt Disney Company announced a plan (equivalent to at the time) to rescue the financially struggling Disneyland Paris resort, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported on 6 October 2014. The park was burdened by its debt, which at the time was calculated at about (), roughly 15 times its gross average earnings.

Up to that point, Disney only held a minority ownership stake in the resort. In early 2017, the company purchased 9% of Euro Disney S.C.A., buying 9% from Kingdom Holding and issued a tender offer of €2 per share for the remaining stock. This brought The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s total ownership to 85.7%. The Walt Disney company also invested an additional to strengthen and develop Disneyland Paris. In June 2017, Disney completed its tender offer and at the time owned over 97% of Euro Disney. It then implemented a full buyout of the shares they did not already own. In 2018, after taking full control of Disneyland Paris, Walt Disney reported its plans to invest () into the Disneyland Paris resort.

==History==
===Seeking a location for a European resort===

Following the success of Disneyland in California, plans to build a similar theme park in Europe emerged in 1966 with sites in Frankfurt, Paris, London or Milan under consideration. Under the leadership of E. Cardon Walker, Tokyo Disneyland opened in 1983 in Japan with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion. In late 1984 the heads of Disney&#x27;s theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. Britain, France, Italy and Spain were all considered. However, Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land. By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in Spain. Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney.

Both Spanish sites were located near the Mediterranean and offered a subtropical climate similar to Disney&#x27;s parks in California and Florida. Disney had asked each site to provide average temperatures for every month for the previous 40 years, which proved a complicated endeavour as none of the records were computerised. The site in Pego, Alicante became the front-runner, but the location was controversial as it would have meant the destruction of Marjal de Pego-Oliva marshlands, a site of natural beauty and one of the last homes of the almost extinct Samaruc or Valencia Toothcarp, so there was some local outcry among environmentalists. Disney had also shown interest in a site near Toulon in southern France, not far from Marseille. The pleasing landscape of that region, as well as its climate, made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland. However, shallow bedrock was encountered beneath the site, which would have rendered construction too difficult. Finally, a site in the rural town of Marne-la-Vallée was chosen because of its proximity to Paris and its central location in Western Europe. This location was estimated to be no more than a four-hour drive for 68 million people and no more than a two-hour flight for a further 300 million.

Michael Eisner signed the first letter of agreement with the French government for the site on 18 December 1985, and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring. The final contract was signed by the leaders of the Walt Disney Company and the French government and territorial collectivities on 24 March 1987. Construction began in August 1988, and in December 1990, an information centre named &quot;Espace Euro Disney&quot; was opened to show the public what was being constructed at the time. Plans for a theme park next to Euro Disneyland based on the entertainment industry, Disney-MGM Studios Europe, quickly went into development, scheduled to open in 1995 with a construction budget of US$2.3 billion. The construction manager was Bovis.

===Design and construction===
To provide lodging to patrons, it was decided that 5,200 Disney-owned hotel rooms would be built within the complex. In March 1988, Disney and a council of architects (Frank Gehry, Michael Graves, Robert A.M. Stern, Stanley Tigerman, and Robert Venturi) decided on an exclusively American theme in which each hotel would depict a region of the United States. At the time of the opening in April 1992, seven hotels collectively housing 5,800 rooms had been built.

An entertainment, shopping, and dining complex based on Walt Disney World&#x27;s Downtown Disney was designed by Frank Gehry.

With its towers of oxidised silver and bronze-coloured stainless steel under a canopy of lights, it opened as &quot;Festival Disney&quot;. For a projected daily attendance of 55,000, Euro Disney planned to serve an estimated 14,000 people per hour inside the Euro Disneyland park. To accomplish this, 29 restaurants were built inside the park (with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival Disney). Menus and prices were varied with an American flavor predominant and Disney&#x27;s precedent of not serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park.

2,300 patio seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy Europeans&#x27; expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In test kitchens at Walt Disney World, recipes were adapted for European tastes. Walter Meyer, executive chef for menu development at Euro Disney and executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted, &quot;A few things we did need to change, but most of the time people kept telling us, &#x27;Do your own thing. Do what&#x27;s American&#x27;.&quot;

===Recruitment/employment===
Unlike Disney&#x27;s American theme parks, Euro Disney aimed for permanent employees (an estimated requirement of 12,000 for the theme park itself), as opposed to seasonal and temporary part-time employees. Casting centres were set up in Paris, London, and Amsterdam. However, it was understood by the French government and Disney that &quot;a concentrated effort would be made to tap into the local French labour market&quot;. Disney sought workers with sufficient communication skills, who spoke two European languages (French and one other), and were socially outgoing. Following precedent, Euro Disney set up its own Disney University to train workers. 24,000 people had applied by November 1991.

In 2011, the park provided 55,643 direct and indirect jobs in France. According to Damien Audric, Director of Development and the Environment, Disneyland Paris would generate 63,000 jobs by 2022. Overall, in 2022, Disneyland Paris was still Seine-et-Marne&#x27;s largest employer.

===Controversies===
The prospect of a Disney park in France was a subject of debate and controversy. Critics, who included prominent French intellectuals, denounced what they considered to be the cultural imperialism of Euro Disney and felt it would encourage an unhealthy American type of consumerism in France. On 28 June 1992, a group of French farmers blockaded Euro Disney in protest of farm policies supported at the time by the United States.

A journalist at the centre-right French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; wrote, &quot;I wish with all my heart that the rebels would set fire to [Euro] Disneyland.&quot; Ariane Mnouchkine, a Parisian stage director, named the concept a &quot;cultural Chernobyl&quot;, a phrase which would be echoed in the media during Euro Disney&#x27;s initial years.

In response, French philosopher Michel Serres noted, &quot;It is not America that is invading us. It is we who adore it, who adopt its fashions and above all, its words.&quot; Euro Disney S.C.A.&#x27;s then-chairman Robert Fitzpatrick responded, &quot;We didn&#x27;t come in and say O.K., we&#x27;re going to put a beret and a baguette on Mickey Mouse. We are who we are.&quot;

Topics of controversy also included Disney&#x27;s American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney&#x27;s appearance code for members of staff, which listed regulations and limitations for the use of makeup, facial hair, tattoos, jewellery, and more.

French labour unions mounted protests against the appearance code, which they saw as &quot;an attack on individual liberty&quot;. Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture, individualism, and privacy, because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under French law, unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary.

Disney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. &quot;For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint,&quot; said Thor Degelmann, Euro Disney&#x27;s personnel director. &quot;Without it we couldn&#x27;t be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting.&quot;

===Opening day and early years===
Euro Disney opened for employee preview and testing in March 1992. During this time, visitors were mostly park employees and their family members, who tested facilities and operations. The press was able to visit the day before the park&#x27;s opening day, 12 April 1992.

On 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened. Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct RER railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible. Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance. The failure of Euro Disney caused the cancellation of several projects like WestCOT, Disney&#x27;s America, Tomorrowland 2055 at Disneyland and Beastly Kingdom at Disney&#x27;s Animal Kingdom.

A new Indiana Jones roller coaster ride was opened at Euro Disney in 1993. A few weeks after the ride opened, there were problems with the emergency brakes which resulted in guest injuries.

In 1994, the company was still having financial difficulties. There were rumours that Euro Disney was getting close to having to file for bankruptcy. The banks and the backers had meetings to work out some of the financial problems facing Euro Disney. In March 1994, Team Disney went into negotiations with the banks so that they could get some help for their debt. As a last resort, the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Euro Disney theme park, leaving the banks with the land.

===Financial, attendance and employment struggles===

In May 1992, entertainment magazine &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that about 25% of Euro Disney&#x27;s workforce, approximately 3,000 people, had resigned from their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park&#x27;s attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the recession and increased unemployment, which was affecting France and most of the rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.

Euro Disney S.C.A. responded in an interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, in which Robert Fitzpatrick claimed only 1,000 people had left their jobs. In response to the financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios Europe project would be put on halt until a further decision could be made. Prices at the hotels were reduced.
Despite these efforts in May 1992, park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock price spiraled downward and on 23 July 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million French francs. During Euro Disney&#x27;s first winter, hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the Newport Bay Club hotel during the season.

Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts found spending to be around 12% lower. Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began 12 June 1993.

By the summer of 1994, Euro Disney was burdened with $3 billion worth of debt. Disney CFO Richard Nanula and Wall Street financier Steve Norris worked with Alwaleed&#x27;s business advisor Mustafa Al Hejailan to rescue the overleveraged company. In that deal, Disney&#x27;s 49 percent stake was reduced to 39 percent, the banks agreed to forego interest payments until 1997, Disney wrote off royalties and fees until 1999, and Alwaleed agreed to pay $345 million for a 24 percent stake in Euro Disney.

===1995 turnaround===
On 1 October 1994, Euro Disney changed its name to Disneyland Paris. On 31 May 1995, a new attraction opened at the theme park. Space Mountain: De la Terre à la Lune had been planned since the inception of Disneyland Paris under the name &quot;Discovery Mountain&quot;, but was reserved for a revival of public interest. With a redesign of the attraction (which had premiered as Space Mountain at the Walt Disney World Resort&#x27;s Magic Kingdom in 1975) including a &quot;cannon launch&quot; system, inversions, and an on-ride soundtrack, the US$100 million attraction was dedicated in a ceremony attended by celebrities such as Elton John, Claudia Schiffer, and Buzz Aldrin.

On 25 July 1995, Disneyland Paris reported its first quarterly profit of US$35.3 million. On 15 November 1995, the results for the fiscal year ending 30 September 1995 were released; in one year the theme park&#x27;s attendance had climbed from 8.8 million to 10.7 million, an increase of 21%. Hotel occupancy had also climbed from 60 to 68.5%. After debt payments, Disneyland Paris ended the year with a net profit of US$22.8 million.

===2000–2017===
In March 2002, Disneyland Paris underwent a second name change to Disneyland Resort Paris. In 2002, Euro Disney S.C.A. and the Walt Disney Company announced another annual profit for Disneyland Paris. However, it then incurred a net loss in the three years following. By March 2004, the Walt Disney Company had agreed to write off all debt that Euro Disney S.C.A. owed to the Walt Disney Company. On 1 December 2003, Euro Disney S.C.A launched the &#x27;Need Magic?&#x27; campaign, which lasted until March 2006 to bring new, first-time European visitors to the resort.

In March 2006, Disneyland Resort Paris launched the advertising campaign &quot;believe in your dreams&quot; and paired with the TGV East European Line to encourage European family attendance to the resort. Shortly after announcing a 12% increase in revenues for the fiscal year of 2007, Euro Disney S.C.A. implemented a &quot;reverse split&quot; consolidation of shares of 100 to 1. August 2008 brought the resort&#x27;s 200 millionth visitor, and made for the third consecutive year of growth in revenues for the resort as well as a record 15.3 million visitors in attendance.

In 2009, the resort started to recruit new employees, especially for the Christmas and summer seasons, which continued in 2010 and 2011 when 2,000 and 3,000 employment contracts being offered, respectively. The 2009 fiscal year saw a decrease in revenues by 7% and a net loss of €63 million followed by stable revenues at €1.2 billion in fiscal year 2010. Euro Disney S.C.A. refinanced their debt to Walt Disney Company again for €1.3 billion in September 2012.

A study done by the Inter-ministerial Delegation reviewing Disneyland Paris&#x27; contribution to the French economy was released in time for the Resort&#x27;s 20th anniversary in March 2012. It found that despite the resort&#x27;s financial hardships, it had generated &quot;37 billion euros in tourism-related revenues over twenty years&quot;, supports on average 55,000 jobs in France annually, and that one job at Disneyland Paris generates nearly three jobs elsewhere in France.

For the first time in the resort&#x27;s history, both the Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park closed from 14 to 17 November 2015, as part of France&#x27;s period of national mourning following the terrorist attacks that took place that month in Paris.

In 2015, Euro Disney announced major renovations for 2015, 2016 and 2017 in preparation for the complex&#x27;s 25th anniversary.

The Themed Entertainment Association considers Disneyland Paris to be the leading European resort in 2016 with a total of 13.37 million visitors. With two amusement parks and 5,800 rooms, it is followed by the Europa-Park resort with 5.6 million visitors and 953 rooms. The Spanish complex PortAventura World completes the rank top three in Europe. It features three themed-parks as well as 2,100 rooms.

=== 2017–present: Expansions ===

On 19 June 2017, the resort&#x27;s operating company, Euro Disney S.C.A, was acquired by The Walt Disney Company, giving them full control of the resort.

In March 2018, a Disney Parks West regional division was formed with Disneyland Resort in California, Walt Disney World in Florida, and Disneyland Paris under Catherine Powell, outgoing Disneyland Paris president. This mirrors the Disney Parks East regional division consisting of Shanghai Disney Resort, Hong Kong Disneyland and Walt Disney Attractions Japan and headed by Michael Colglazier. In September 2019, Powell exited her post as president of the Parks West division, with the division dissolving, and Disneyland Paris transferred to Disney Parks International.

On 1 June 2019, Disneyland Paris sponsored the Magical Pride Party, an LGBTQ celebration. Previous similar events have taken place at the park since 2014, but were not officially sponsored by Disney.

== Regional impact ==
Disneyland Paris is the driving force behind the urban and economic development of the Val-d’Europe conurbation due to tourism brought in by the park.

Disneyland is also one of Europe&#x27;s leading private tourist destinations with nearly 15 million visitors every year. After 25 years of its opening, Disneyland Paris recorded 320 million visits in 2017. The same year, it was reported that Disneyland Paris benefited the French economy by €66 billion in added value since its opening in 1992. It was also noted that Disneyland Paris contributed to the French economy through producing 56,000 direct and indirect jobs in 2017.

Disneyland Paris significantly contributes to the sector of tourism in France. Tourists visiting Disneyland Paris generate 6% of tourism revenue in France and 17% of sales in the Ile-de-France region. In 2023, it was reported that more than 375 million visitors have been to Disneyland Paris with an average of 50% French and 50% foreign.

== Environmental sustainability ==
Since 2019, plastic straws and bags have been replaced by paper equivalents and bags made from 80% recycled plastic. This is not the site&#x27;s first eco-responsible initiative. In 2013, it launched a program to optimize water management. Since 2013, the park has had its own wastewater treatment plant, enabling it to produce 2,100 m3 of water a day from its wastewater. On-site treatment enables ecological and economical management. Being the only theme park in Europe to have this kind of installation, Disneyland Paris has saved over 2 million m3 of drinking water since launching the system.

In 2022, Disneyland Paris announced that a total of 82,000 solar panels would be installed, generating 36 GWh of electricity per year. The system will cover 17% of the tourist park&#x27;s electricity needs and already includes 46,000 photovoltaic panels. The project is expected to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 890 tonnes of CO₂ yearly.

In September 2023, Disneyland Paris renewed its involvement in World-Clean-Up Day, the world&#x27;s largest environmental clean-up campaign. Accordingly, Disneyland Paris encouraged its team and Disney VoluntEARS to take part of the initiative.

The park is approximately , and is divided into two main parks, the fairytale-themed Disneyland Park and the Walt Disney Studios Park, each holds its separate attraction areas within them. While the first park opened in 1992 and included attractions inspired by &#x27;classic Disney characters&#x27;, the second one opened in 2002 and included &#x27;cinema-themed rides&#x27;.

The park receives around fifteen million visitors a year, accordingly, it is considered to be one of the most famous amusement parks in Europe.

===Hotels===
The complex features six Disneyland Paris hotels. The Disneyland Hotel is located over the entrance of the Disneyland Park and is marketed as the most prestigious hotel on the property. A body of water known as Lake Disney is surrounded by Disney Hotel New York – The Art of Marvel, Disney Newport Bay Club, and Disney Sequoia Lodge. Disney Hotel Cheyenne and Disney Hotel Santa Fe are located near Lake Disney; Disney Davy Crockett Ranch is located in a woodland area outside the resort perimeter.


Disneyland Paris includes six on-site partner hotels that are not managed by The Walt Disney Company but provide free shuttle buses to the parks: B&amp;B Hotel, Algonquin&#x27;s Explorers Hotel and Campanile Val de France. There are also two associated hotels located in Val d&#x27;Europe: Adagio Marne-la-Vallée Val d&#x27;Europe and Hôtel l&#x27;Élysée Val d&#x27;Europe.

===Resorts===
Located set back from the parks, these resorts specialize in adventurous and aquatic activities.

===Transport===

A large railway station, Marne-la-Vallée–Chessy, is located between the theme parks and Disney Village. It opened on 1 April 1992 and is notably served by regional express line RER A which provides a direct connection with the centre of Paris and for further connections, direct to Paris-Gare-de-Lyon.

The railway station is also served by long-distance high-speed TGV and Ouigo trains offering direct services to many cities across France. There are also Thalys services to both Brussels and Amsterdam.

Eurostar services were introduced between Disneyland Paris and London St Pancras International in 1996. These were suspended on 7 June 2023, though Eurostar announced they may be reinstated the following year. Customers can still travel from St Pancras to the resort by changing trains at Lille Europe. The suspension has been caused by the financial collapse of Eurostar during the COVID-19 pandemic, and further complications with post-Brexit border controls although Eurostar intends to revisits options the following year.

Free Disney shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels and Les Villages Nature Paris (except Disney Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels. They are accessed from the Disneyland bus station.

===Backstage Disney===
Disneyland Paris has strict rules designed to prevent guests from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in all backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not for the public to see. Numerous area gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade floats, etc. When area gates around the park are open, anything that can be seen through them is considered to be on-stage and part of the Disney Magic. Therefore, from the moment the gates are open, all of the cast must be in character and in place to &#x27;perform&#x27;. As the complex is so big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the parks via service roads located around the perimeter of the parks.

Many attractions are housed in large, soundstage-like buildings called &quot;show buildings&quot;, some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming. Most show buildings have off-white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for maintenance cast members. Housed inside show buildings are the actual attractions, which include hidden walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other backstage operations.

<text>The temperance movement is a social movement promoting temperance or total abstinence from consumption of alcoholic beverages. Participants in the movement typically criticize alcohol intoxication or promote teetotalism, and its leaders emphasize alcohol&#x27;s negative effects on people&#x27;s health, personalities, and family lives. Typically the movement promotes alcohol education and it also demands the passage of new laws against the sale of alcohol: either regulations on the availability of alcohol, or the prohibition of it. 

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the temperance movement became prominent in many countries, particularly in English-speaking, Scandinavian, and majority Protestant ones, and it eventually led to national prohibitions in Canada (1918 to 1920), Norway (spirits only from 1919 to 1926), Finland (1919 to 1932), and the United States (1920 to 1933), as well as provincial prohibition in India (1948 to present). A number of temperance organizations promote temperance.

==Context==
In late 17th-century North America, alcohol was a vital part of colonial life as a beverage, medicine, and commodity for men, women, and children. Drinking was widely accepted and completely integrated into society; however, drunkenness was not tolerated. In the colonial period of America from around 1623, when a Plymouth minister named William Blackstone began distributing apples and flowers, up until the mid-1800s, hard cider was the primary alcoholic drink of the people. Hard cider was prominent throughout this entire period and nothing compared in scope or availability. It was one of the few aspects of American culture that all the colonies shared. Settlement along the frontier often included a legal requirement whereby an orchard of mature apple trees bearing fruit within three years of settlement were required before a land title was officially granted. For example, The Ohio Company required settlers to plant not less than fifty apple trees and twenty peach trees within three years. These plantings guaranteed land titles. In 1767, the average New England family was consuming seven barrels of hard cider annually, which equates to about 35-gallons per person. Around the mid-1800s, newly arrived immigrants from Germany and elsewhere increased beer&#x27;s popularity, and the temperance movement and continued westward expansion caused farmers to abandon their cider orchards.

Attitudes toward alcohol in Great Britain became increasingly negative in the late 18th century. One of the reasons for this shift was the need for sober laborers to operate heavy machinery developed in the Industrial Revolution. Anthony Benezet suggested abstinence from alcohol in 1775. As early as the 1790s, physician Benjamin Rush envisioned a disease-like syndrome caused by excessive drinking, the &quot;symptoms&quot; being moral and physical decay. He cited abstinence as the only treatment option. Rush saw benefits in fermented drinks, but condemned the use of distilled spirits. As well as addiction, Rush noticed the correlation that drunkenness had with disease, death, suicide, and crime. According to &quot;Pompili, Maurizio et al&quot;, there is increasing evidence that, aside from the volume of alcohol consumed, the pattern of the drinking is relevant for health outcomes. Overall, there is a causal relationship between alcohol consumption and more than 60 types of diseases and injuries. Alcohol is estimated to cause about 20–30% of cases of esophageal cancer, liver cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, homicide, epilepsy and motor vehicle accidents. After the American Revolution, Rush called upon ministers of various churches to act in preaching the messages of temperance. However, abstinence messages were largely ignored by Americans until the 1820s.

== History ==
Temperance is one of the cardinal virtues listed in Aristotle&#x27;s tractate the Nicomachean Ethics.

===Origins (pre-1820)===
During the 18th century, Native American cultures and societies were severely affected by alcohol, which was often given in trade for furs, leading to poverty and social disintegration. As early as 1737, Native American temperance activists began to campaign against alcohol and for legislation to restrict the sale and distribution of alcoholic drinks in indigenous communities. During the colonial era, leaders such as Peter Chartier, King Hagler and Little Turtle resisted the use of rum and brandy as trade items, in an effort to protect Native Americans from cultural changes they viewed as destructive.

In the 18th century, there was a gin craze in Great Britain. The middle classes became increasingly critical of the widespread drunkenness among the lower classes. Motivated by the middle-class desire for order, and amplified by the population growth in the cities, the drinking of gin became the subject of critical national debate. In 1743, John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Churches, proclaimed &quot;that buying, selling, and drinking of liquor, unless absolutely necessary, were evils to be avoided&quot;.

In the early 19th-century United States, alcohol was still regarded as a necessary part of the American diet for both practical and social reasons. Water supplies were often polluted, milk was not always available, and coffee and tea were expensive. Social constructs of the time also made it impolite for people (particularly men) to refuse alcohol. Drunkenness was not a problem, because people would only drink small amounts of alcohol throughout the day; at the turn of the 19th century, however, overindulgence and subsequent intoxication became problems that often led to the disintegration of the family. Early temperance societies, often associated with churches, were located in upstate New York and New England, but only lasted a few years. These early temperance societies called for moderate drinking (hence the name &quot;&quot;), but had little influence outside of their geographical areas.

In 1810, Calvinist ministers met in a seminary in Massachusetts to write articles about abstinence from alcohol to use in preaching to their congregations. The Massachusetts Society for the Suppression of Intemperance (MSSI) was formed in 1813. The organization only accepted men of high social standing and encouraged moderation in alcohol consumption. Its peak of influence was in 1818, and it ended in 1820, having made no significant mark on the future of the temperance movement. Other small temperance societies appeared in the 1810s, but had little impact outside their immediate regions and they disbanded soon after. Their methods had little effect in implementing temperance, and drinking actually increased until after 1830; however, their methods of public abstinence pledges and meetings, as well as handing out pamphlets, were implemented by more lasting temperance societies such as the American Temperance Society.

The first temperance society in Pennsylvania, of which a record has been found was that of &quot;Darby Association for Discouraging the Unnecessary Use of Spirituous Liquors&quot; organized in Delaware County in 1819, at the Darby Friends Meetinghouse.

=== Promoting moderation (1820s–1830s) ===

The temperance movement in the United States began at a national level in the 1820s, having been popularized by evangelical temperance reformers and among the middle classes. There was a concentration on advice against hard spirits rather than on abstinence from all alcohol, and on moral reform rather than legal measures against alcohol. An earlier temperance movement had begun during the American Revolution in Connecticut, Virginia and New York state, with farmers forming associations to ban whiskey distilling. The movement spread to eight states, advocating temperance rather than abstinence and taking positions on religious issues such as observance of the Sabbath.

After the American Revolution there was a new emphasis on good citizenship for the new republic. With the Evangelical Protestant religious revival of the 1820s and 1830s, called the Second Great Awakening, social movements began aiming for a perfect society. This included abolitionism and temperance. The Awakening brought with it an optimism about moral reform, achieved through volunteer organizations. Although the temperance movement was nonsectarian in principle, the movement consisted mostly of church-goers.

The temperance movement promoted temperance and emphasized the moral, economical and medical effects of overindulgence. Connecticut-born minister Lyman Beecher published a book in 1826 called &quot;Six Sermons on...Intemperance&quot;. Beecher described inebriation as a &quot;national sin&quot; and suggested legislation to prohibit the sales of alcohol. He believed that it was only possible for drinkers to reform in the early stages of addiction, because anyone in advanced stages of addiction, according to Beecher, had damaged their morality and could not be saved. Early temperance reformers often viewed drunkards as warnings rather than as victims of a disease, leaving the state to take care of them and their conduct. In the same year, the American Temperance Society (ATS) was formed in Boston, Massachusetts, within 12 years claiming more than 8,000 local groups and over 1,250,000 members. Presbyterian preacher Charles Grandison Finney taught abstinence from ardent spirits. In the Rochester, New York revival of 1831, individuals were required to sign a temperance pledge in order to receive salvation. Finney believed and taught that the body represented the &quot;temple of God&quot; and anything that harmed the &quot;temple&quot;, including alcohol, must be avoided. By 1833, several thousand groups similar to the ATS had been formed in most states. In some of these large communities, temperance almanacs were released which gave information about planting and harvesting as well as current information about temperance-related issues.

Temperance societies were being organized in England about the same time, many inspired by a Belfast professor of theology, and Presbyterian Church of Ireland minister John Edgar, who poured his stock of whiskey out of his window in 1829. He mainly concentrated on the elimination of spirits rather than wine and beer. On August 14, 1829, he wrote a letter in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; publicizing his views on temperance. He also formed the Ulster Temperance Movement with other Presbyterian clergy, initially enduring ridicule from members of his community.

The 1830s saw a tremendous growth in temperance groups, not just in England and the United States, but also in British colonies, especially New Zealand and Australia. The Pequot writer and minister William Apess (1798–1839) established the first formal Native American temperance society among the Maspee Indians on 11 October 1833.

Out of the religious revival and reform appeared the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Seventh-day Adventism, new Christian denominations that established criteria for healthy living as a part of their religious teachings, namely temperance.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The Word of Wisdom is a health code followed by the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other Latter Day Saint denominations which advises how to maintain good health: what one should do and what one should abstain from. One of the most prominent items in the Word of Wisdom is the complete abstinence from alcohol. When the Word of Wisdom was written, the Latter Day Saints were residing in Kirtland, Ohio and the Kirtland Temperance Society was organized on October 6, 1830, with 239 members. According to some scholars, the Word of Wisdom was influenced by the temperance movement. In June 1830, the &quot;Millennial Harbinger&quot; quoted from a book &quot;The Simplicity of Health&quot;, which strongly condemned the use of alcohol and tobacco, and the untempered consumption of meat, similar to the provisions in the Word of Wisdom revealed three years later. This gave publicity to the movement and Temperance Societies began to form. On February 1, 1833, a few weeks before the Word of Wisdom was published, all distilleries in the Kirtland area were shut down. During the early history of the Word of Wisdom, temperance and other items in the health code were seen more as wise recommendations than as commandments.

Although he advocated temperance, Joseph Smith did not preach complete abstinence from alcohol. According to Paul H. Peterson and Ronald W. Walker, Smith did not enforce abstinence from alcohol because he believed that it threatened individual choice and agency and that a requirement for the Latter Day Saints to comply would cause division in the church. In Harry M. Beardsley&#x27;s book &quot;Joseph Smith and his Mormon Empire&quot;, Beardsley argues that some Mormon historians attempted to portray Smith as a teetotaler, but according to the testimonies of his contemporaries, he often drank alcohol in his own home or the homes of his friends in Kirtland. In Nauvoo, Illinois, Smith was far less discreet with his drinking habits. However, at the end of the 19th century, second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Brigham Young said that the Saints could no longer justify disobeying the Word of Wisdom because of the way that it originally was presented. In 1921, Heber J. Grant, then president of the LDS church, officially called on the Latter-day Saints to strictly adhere to the Word of Wisdom, including complete abstinence from alcohol.
====Millerites and Seventh-day Adventists====
William Miller, the founder of the Millerites, claimed that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ would be in 1843 and that anyone who drank alcohol would be unprepared for the Second Coming. After the Great Disappointment in 1843, the Seventh-day Adventist denomination adopted health reforms inspired by influential church pioneers Ellen G. White and her husband, a preacher, James Springer White, who did not use alcohol or tobacco. Ellen preached healthful living to her followers, without specifying abstinence from alcohol, as most of her followers were temperance followers, and abstinence would have been implied.

=== Teetotalism (1830s) ===

As a response to rising social problems in urbanized areas, a stricter form of temperance emerged called teetotalism, which promoted the complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages, this time including wine and beer, not just ardent spirits. The term &quot;teetotaler&quot; came from the capital &quot;T&quot;s that were written next to the names of people who pledged complete abstinence from alcohol. People were instructed to only drink pure water and the teetotalists were known as the &quot;pure-water army&quot;. In the US, the American Temperance Union advocated total abstinence from distilled and fermented liquors. By 1835, they had gained 1.5million members. This created conflict between the teetotalists and the more moderate members of the ATS. Although there were temperance societies in the South, as the movement became more closely tied with the abolitionist movement, people in the South created their own teetotal societies. Considering drinking to be an important part of their cultures, German and Irish immigrants resisted the movement. In the UK, teetotalism originated in Preston, Lancashire in 1833. The Catholic temperance movement started in 1838 when the Irish priest Theobald Mathew established the Teetotal Abstinence Society in 1838. In 1838, the mass working class movement for universal suffrage for men, Chartism, included a current called &quot;temperance chartism&quot;. Faced with the refusal of the Parliament of the time to give the right to vote to working people, the temperance chartists saw the campaign against alcohol as a way of proving to the elites that working-class people were responsible enough to be granted the vote. In short, the 1830s was mostly characterized by moral persuasion of workers.

=== Growing radicalism and influence (1840s–1850s) ===
==== The Washingtonian movement ====
In 1840, a group of artisans in Baltimore, Maryland created their own temperance society that could appeal to hard-drinking men like themselves. Calling themselves the Washingtonians, they pledged complete abstinence, attempting to persuade others through their own experience with alcohol rather than relying on preaching and religious lectures. They argued that sympathy was an overlooked method for helping people with alcohol addictions, citing coercion as an ineffective method. For that reason, they did not support prohibitive legislation of alcohol. They were suspicious of the divisiveness of denominational religion and did not use religion in their discussions, emphasizing personal abstinence. They never set up national organizations, believing that concentration of power and distance from citizens causes corruption. Meetings were public and they encouraged equal participation, appealing to both men and women and northerners and southerners. Unlike early temperance reformers, the Washingtonians did not believe that intemperance destroyed a drinker&#x27;s morality. They worked on the platform that abstinence communities could be created through sympathizing with drunkards rather than ostracizing them through the belief that they are sinners or diseased.

On February 22, 1842, in Springfield, Illinois, while a member of the Illinois Legislature, Abraham Lincoln gave an address to the Springfield Washington Temperance Society on the 110th anniversary of the birth of George Washington. In the speech, Lincoln criticized early methods of the temperance movement as overly forceful and advocated reason as the solution to the problem of intemperance, praising the current temperance movement methods of the Washingtonian movement.

By 1845, the Washingtonian movement was no longer as prominent for three reasons. First, the evangelist reformers attacked them for refusing to admit alcoholism was a sin. Secondly, the movement was criticized as unsuccessful due to the number of men who returned to drinking. Finally, the movement was internally divided by differing views on prohibition legislation. Temperance fraternal societies such as the Sons of Temperance and the Good Samaritans took the place of the Washingtonian movement with largely similar views relating to helping alcoholics by way of sympathy and philanthropy. They, however, differed from the Washingtonians through their closed rather than public meetings, fines, and membership qualifications, believing their methods were more effective in curbing men&#x27;s alcohol addictions. After the 1850s, the temperance movement was characterized more by prevention by means of prohibitions laws than remedial efforts to facilitate the recovery of alcoholics.

==== Gospel temperance ====
By the mid-1850s, the United States was divided from differing views of slavery and prohibition laws and economic depression. This influenced the Third Great Awakening in the United States. The prayer meeting largely characterized this religious revival. Prayer meetings were devotional meetings run by laypeople rather than clergy and consisted of prayer and testimony by attendees. The meetings were held frequently and pledges of temperance were confessed. Prayer meetings and pledges characterized the post-Civil war &quot;gospel&quot; temperance movement. This movement was similar to early temperance movements in that drunkenness was seen as a sin; however, public testimony was used to convert others and convince them to sign the pledge. New and revitalized organizations emerged including the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) and the early Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The movement relied on the reformed individuals using local evangelical resources to create institutions to reform drunk men. Reformed men in Massachusetts and Maine formed &quot;ribbon&quot; clubs to support men who were interested in stopping drinking. Ribbon reformers traveled throughout the Midwest forming clubs and sharing their experiences with others. Gospel rescue missions or inebriate homes were created that allowed homeless drunkards a safe place to reform and learn to practice total abstinence while receiving food and shelter. These movements emphasized sympathy over coercion, yet unlike the Washingtonian movements, emphasized helplessness as well with relief from their addictions as a result from seeking the grace of God.

As an expression of moralism, the membership of the temperance movement overlapped with that of the abolitionist movement and women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

During the Victorian period, the temperance movement became more political, advocating the legal prohibition of all alcohol, rather than only calling for moderation. Proponents of temperance, teetotalism and prohibition came to be known as the &quot;drys&quot;.

There was still a focus on the working class, but also their children. The Band of Hope was founded in 1847 in Leeds, UK by the Reverend Jabez Tunnicliff. It aimed to save working class children from the drinking parents by teaching them the importance and principles of sobriety and teetotalism. In 1855, a national organisation was formed amidst an explosion of Band of Hope work. Meetings were held in churches throughout the UK and included Christian teaching. The group campaigned politically for the curtailment of the influence of pubs and brewers. The organization became quite radical, organizing rallies, demonstrations and marches to influence as many people as possible to sign the pledge of allegiance to the society and to resolve to abstain &quot;from all liquors of an intoxicating quality, whether ale, porter, wine or spirits, except as medicine.&quot;

In this period there was local success at restricting or banning the sale of alcohol in many parts of the United States. In 1838, Massachusetts banned certain sales of spirits. The law was repealed two years later, but it set a precedent. In 1845, Michigan allowed its municipalities to decide whether they were going to prohibit. In 1851, a law was passed in Maine that was a full-fledged prohibition, and this was followed by bans in several other states in the next two decades.

The movement became more effective, with alcohol consumption in the US being decreased by half between 1830 and 1840. During this time, prohibition laws came into effect in twelve US states, such as Maine. A Maine law was passed in 1851 by the efforts of Neal Dow. Organized opposition caused five of these states to eliminate or weaken the laws.

=== Transition to a mass movement (1860s–1900s) ===

By the 1860s the temperance movement had become a significant mass movement and it encouraged a general abstinence from the consumption of alcohol. A general movement to build alternatives to replace the functions of public bars existed, so the Independent Order of Rechabites was formed in England, with a branch later opening in the US as a friendly society that did not hold meetings in public bars. There was also a movement to introduce temperance fountains across the United States—to provide people with reliably safe drinking water rather than saloon alcohol.

In the United States, the National Prohibition Party which was led by John Russell gradually became more popular, gaining more votes, as they felt that the existing Democrat and Republican parties did not do enough for the temperance cause. The party was associated with the Independent Order of Good Templars, which entertained a universalist orientation, being more open to blacks and repentant alcoholics than most other organizations.

Reflecting the teaching on alcohol of their founder John Wesley, Methodist churches were aligned with the temperance movement. Methodists believed that despite the supposed economic benefits of liquor traffic such as job creation and taxes, the harm that it caused society through its contribution to murder, gambling, prostitution, crime, and political corruption outweighed its economic benefits. In Great Britain, both Wesleyan Methodists and Primitive Methodists championed the cause of temperance; the Methodist Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals was later established in the United States to advance the movement. In 1864, the Salvation Army, another denomination in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition, was founded in London with a heavy emphasis on abstinence from alcohol and ministering to the working class, which led publicans to fund a Skeleton Army in order to disrupt their meetings. The Salvation Army quickly spread internationally, maintaining an emphasis on abstinence. Many of the most important prohibitionist groups, such as the avowedly prohibitionist United Kingdom Alliance (1853) and the US-based (but international) Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU; 1873), began in the latter half of the 19th century, the latter of which was one of the largest women&#x27;s societies in the world at that time. But the largest and most radical international temperance organization was the Good Templars. In 1862, the &quot;Soldiers Total Abstinence Association&quot; was founded in British India by Joseph Gelson Gregson, a Baptist missionary. In 1898, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was formed by James Cullen, an Irish Catholic, which spread to other English-speaking Catholic communities.

In 1870, a group of physicians founded the American Association of the Cure of Inebrity (AACI) in order to treat alcohol addiction. The two goals of this organization were to convince skeptical members of the medical community of the existence and seriousness of the disease of alcoholism and prove the efficacy of asylum treatments for alcoholics. They argued for more genetic causes of alcohol addictions. Treatments often included restraining patients while they reformed, both physically and morally.

During the same period, there was significant pushback against the growing temperance movement, particularly in urban areas with significant European immigrant communities. Chicago political bosses A.C. Hesing and Hermann Raster forced the Republican Party to adopt an anti-temperance platform at the 1872 Republican National Convention with the threat of taking the German and European vote away from the party. The following year, Hesing formed the People&#x27;s Party, a breakaway pro-liquor faction of the Republican Party, and elected Harvey Doolittle Colvin as mayor of Chicago by a wide margin.

The Anti-Saloon League was an organization that began in Ohio in 1893. Reacting to urban growth, it was driven by evangelical Protestantism. Furthermore, the League was strongly supported by the WCTU: in some US states alcoholism had become epidemic and rates of domestic violence were also high. At that time, Americans drank about three times as much alcohol as they drank in the 2010s. The League simultaneously campaigned for suffrage and temperance, with its leader Susan B. Anthony stating that &quot;The only hope of the Anti-Saloon League&#x27;s success lies in putting the ballot into the hands of women&quot;, i.e. it was expected that the first act that women were to take upon themselves after having obtained the right to vote, was to vote for an alcohol ban.

The actions of the temperance movement included organizing sobriety lectures and setting up reform clubs for men and children. Some proponents also opened special temperance hotels and lunch wagons, and they also lobbied for banning liquor during prominent events. The Scientific Temperance Instruction Movement published textbooks, promoted alcohol education and held many lectures. Political action included lobbying local legislators and creating petition campaigns.

This new trend in the history of the temperance movement was the last but it proved to be the most effective. Scholars have estimated that by 1900, one in ten Americans had signed a pledge to abstain from drinking, as the temperance movement became the most well-organized lobby group of the time. International conferences were held, in which temperance advocacy methods and policies were discussed. By the turn of the century, temperance societies became commonplace in the US.

During that time, there was also a growth in the number of non-religious temperance groups which were linked to left-wing movements, such as the Scottish Prohibition Party. Founded in 1901, it went on to defeat Winston Churchill in Dundee in the 1922 general election.

=== Legislative successes and failures (1910s) ===

A favorite goal of the British Temperance movement was sharply to reduce heavy drinking by closing as many pubs as possible. Advocates were Protestant nonconformists who played a major role in the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party adopted temperance platforms focused on local option. In 1908, Prime Minister H.H. Asquith—although a heavy drinker himself—took the lead by proposing to close about a third of the 100,000 pubs in England and Wales, with the owners compensated through a new tax on surviving pubs. The brewers controlled the pubs and organized a stiff resistance, supported by the Conservatives, who repeatedly defeated the proposal in the House of Lords. However, the People&#x27;s Tax of 1910 included a stiff tax on pubs.

The movement gained traction during the First World War, with President Wilson issuing sharp restrictions on the sale of alcohol in many combatant countries. This was done to preserve grain for food production. During this time, prohibitionists used anti-German sentiment related to the war to rally against alcohol sales, since many brewers were of German-American descent.

L&#x27;Alarme: société française d&#x27;action contre l&#x27;alcoolisme was a movement in France, inaugurated in 1914, under the auspices of the Ligue National contre l&#x27;Alcoolisme (National League Against Alcoholism), to bring public sentiment for increased restrictions upon the liquor traffic to bear upon the election of candidates for the Chamber of Deputies. As late as 1919, L&#x27;Alarme did not only oppose fermented liquors, but considered wine and wine-producers among the most powerful forces against ardent spirits, to which the alcoholism opposed by L&#x27;Alarme was considered to be due.

According to alcohol researcher Johan Edman, the first country to issue an alcohol prohibition was Russia, as part of war mobilization policies. This followed after Russia had made significant losses in the war against the sober Japanese in 1905. In the UK, the Liberal government passed the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 when pub hours were licensed, beer was watered down and was subject to a penny a pint extra tax, and in 1916 a State Management Scheme meant that breweries and pubs in certain areas of Britain were nationalized, especially in places where armaments were made.

In 1913, the ASL began its efforts for national prohibition. Wayne Wheeler, a member of the Anti-Saloon League was integral in the prohibition movement in the United States. He used hard political persuasion called &quot;Wheelerism&quot; in the 1920s of legislative bodies. Rather than ask directly for a vote, which Wheeler viewed as weak, Wheeler covered the desks of legislators in telegrams. He was also accomplished in rallying supporters; the Cincinnati &quot;Enquirer&quot; called Wheeler &quot;the strongest political force of his day&quot;. His efforts specifically influenced the passing of the eighteenth-amendment. And in 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment was successfully passed in the United States, introducing prohibition of the manufacture, sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. The amendment, also called &quot;the noble experiment&quot;, was preceded by the National Prohibition Act, which stipulated how the federal government should enforce the amendment.

National prohibition was proposed several times in New Zealand as well, and nearly successful. On a similar note, Australian states and New Zealand introduced
restrictive early closing times for bars during and immediately after the First World War. In Canada, in 1916 the Ontario Temperance Act was passed, prohibiting the sales of alcoholic beverages with more than 2.5% alcohol. In the 1920s imports of alcohol were cut off by provincial referendums.

Norway introduced partial prohibition in 1917, which became full prohibition through a referendum in 1919, but this legislation was overturned in 1926. Similarly, Finland introduced prohibition in 1919, but repealed it in 1932 after an upsurge in violent crime associated with criminal opportunism and the illegal liquor trade. Iceland introduced prohibition in 1915, but liberalized consumption of spirits in 1933, but beer was still illegal until 1989. In the 1910s, half of the countries in the world had introduced some form of alcohol control in their laws or policies.

=== Association with independence movements (1920s–1960s) ===

The temperance movement started to wane in the 1930s, with prohibition being criticised as creating unhealthy drinking habits, encouraging criminals and discouraging economic activity. Prohibition would not last long: The legislative tide largely moved away from prohibition when the Twenty-first Amendment to the Constitution was ratified on December 5, 1933, repealing nationwide prohibition. The gradual relaxation of licensing laws went on throughout the 20th century, with Mississippi being the last state to end prohibition in 1966. In Australia, early hotel closing times were reverted in the 1950s and 1960s.

Initially, prohibition had some positive effects in some states, with Ford reporting that absenteeism in his companies had decreased by half. Alcohol consumption decreased dramatically. Also, statistical analysis has shown that the temperance movement during this time had a positive, but moderate, effect on later adult educational outcomes through providing a healthy pre-natal environment. However, prohibition had negative effects on the US economy, with thousands of jobs being lost, the catering and entertainment industries losing huge profits. The US and other countries with prohibition saw their tax revenues decrease dramatically, with some estimating this at a loss of 11 billion dollars for the US. Furthermore, enforcement of the alcohol ban was an expensive undertaking for the government. Because the Eighteenth Amendment did not prohibit consumption, but only manufacture, distribution and sale, illegal consumption became commonplace. Illegal production of alcohol rose, and a thousand people per year died of alcohol that was illegally produced with little quality control. Bootlegging was a profitable activity, and crime increased rather than decreased as expected and advocated by proponents.

In the United States, the temperance movement was in decline: Fundamentalist and nativist groups had become dominant in the movement, which led moderate members to leave the movement.

During this time, in former colonies (such as Gujarat in India, Sri Lanka and Egypt), the temperance movement was associated with anti-colonialism or religious revival. As such, the temperance movement in India became closely tied with the Indian independence movement as Mahatma Gandhi viewed alcohol as being a foreign importation. He viewed foreign rule as the reason that national prohibition was not yet established at his time.

=== 1960s–present ===
The temperance movement still exists in many parts of the world, but it is generally less politically influential than it was in the early 20th century. Its efforts today include disseminating research regarding alcohol and health, in addition to its effects on society and the family unit.

The addition of warning labels on alcoholic beverages is supported by organizations of the temperance movement, such as the WCTU.

Prominent temperance organizations active today include the World Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Alcohol Justice, International Blue Cross, Independent Order of Rechabites, and International Organisation of Good Templars.

The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection, a Methodist denomination in the conservative holiness movement, as well as the Salvation Army, for example, are Christian Churches that continue to require that their members refrain from drinking alcohol as well as smoking, taking illegal drugs, and gambling.

In youth culture in the 1990s, temperance was an important part of the straight edge scene, which stresses abstinence from other drugs.

Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Herbal Health in Lancashire, England is thought to be the oldest temperance bars and other such establishments have become popular in recent times.

In various parts of the world, voters continue to advocate for alcohol prohibition. For example, in 2016, many women in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu blamed alcohol for societal ills, such as domestic violence, and thus took to the polls to elect a pro-prohibition leader. Their effort succeeded and when Jayaram Jayalalithaa was voted in, she shut down five hundred liquor shops on her first day in office. In 2017, women agitated for temperance and the prohibition of alcohol in the state of Bihar; they campaigned for the election of Nitish Kumar, who upon the request of women, pledged that he would prohibit alcohol. Since signing prohibition legislation, &quot;Murders and gang robberies are down almost 20 percent from a year earlier, and riots by 13 percent. Fatal traffic accidents fell by 10 percent.&quot;

== Beliefs, principles and culture ==
Temperance proponents saw the alcohol problem as the most crucial problem of Western civilization. Alcoholism was seen to cause secondary poverty, and all types of social problems: alcohol was the enemy of everything good that modernity and science had to offer. They believed that abstinence would help decrease crime, make families stronger, and improve society as a whole. Although the temperance movement was non-denominational in principle, the movement consisted mostly of church-goers. Temperance advocates used scientific arguments to back up their views, but at the core the temperance philosophy was moral-religious in nature. The alcohol problem was connected with a sense of purpose and modernity of the western nation, and was largely international in nature, in keeping with the international optimism typical for the period preceding the First World War.

Historical analysis of conference documents helps create an image of what the temperance movement represented. The movement believed that alcohol use disorder was a threat to scientific progress, as it was believed citizens had to be strong and sober to be ready for the modern age. Progressive themes and causes such as abolition, natural self-determination, worker&#x27;s rights, and the importance of women in rearing children to be good citizens were key themes of this citizenship ideology. The movement put itself at service of the state, but was critical of it. In that sense, it was a radical movement with liberal and socialist aspects, but in some parts of the world, notably the US, allied with conservatism. Alcohol was often associated with oppression: not only oppression in the West, but also in colonies. Temperance advocates saw alcohol as a product that &quot;...enables a few to become rich while it impoverishes the very many&quot;. Temperance advocates worked closely with the labor movement, as well as the women suffrage movement, partly because there was mutual support and benefit, and the causes were seen as connected.

=== Prevention, treatment and restriction ===
Temperance proponents used a variety of means to prevent and treat alcohol use disorder and restrict its consumption. At the end of the 19th century, medically oriented treatment of alcohol use disorder became more common. In a trend that was preceded by Rush&#x27;s writings, alcoholism came to be seen as an illness which could be medically treated. Scientists who were temperance proponents attempted to find the underlying causes of alcohol use disorder. At the same time, criticism rose toward use of alcohol in medical care. The notion of alcohol use disorder as a disease became widely accepted much later, generally after the Second World War.

Nevertheless, restriction of consumption was most emphasized in the movement, but ideas on how to accomplish this were varied and conflicting. Apart from the prohibition by law, there were also ideas to establish state monopoly on all alcohol sales, or through law reform remove profit from the alcohol industry.

During the 1900s decade, the ideal of strong citizens was developed into the hygienism ideology. Through the influence of scientific theories on heredity, temperance proponents came to believe that alcohol problems were not just a personal concern, but caused later generations of people to &quot;degenerate&quot; as well. Public hygiene and improving the population through personal lifestyle were therefore promoted. A variety of temperance halls, temperance bars and coffee palaces were established as replacements for saloons. Numerous periodicals devoted to temperance were published and temperance theatre, which had started in the 1820s, became an important part of the American cultural landscape at this time. The temperance movement generated its own popular culture. Popular songwriters such as Susan McFarland Parkhurst, George Frederick Root, Henry Clay Work and Stephen C. Foster composed a number of these songs. At temperance inns puppet plays, minstrel acts, parades and other shows were held.

=== Role of women ===

Much of the temperance movement was based on organized religion, which saw women as responsible for edifying their children to be abstaining citizens. Nevertheless, temperance was tied in with both religious renewal and progressive politics, particularly female suffrage. Furthermore, temperance activists were able to promote suffrage more effectively than suffrage activists were, because of their wide-ranging experiences as activists, and because they argued for a concrete desire for safety at home, rather than for an abstract desire for justice as suffragists did.

By 1831, there were over 24 women&#x27;s organizations which were dedicated to the temperance movement. Women were specifically drawn to the temperance movement, because it represented a fight to end a practice that greatly affected women&#x27;s quality of life. Temperance was seen as a feminine, religious and moral duty, and when it was achieved, it was also seen as a way to gain familial and domestic security as well as salvation in a religious sense. Indeed, scholar Ruth Bordin stated that the temperance movement was &quot;the foremost example of American feminism&quot;. Prominent women such as Amelia Bloomer, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony were active in temperance and abolitionist movements in the 1840s.

A myriad of factors contributed to women&#x27;s interest in the temperance movement. One of the initial contributions was the frequency in which women were the victims of those who had an alcohol use disorder. At a Chicago meeting of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Susan B. Anthony stated that women suffer the most from drunkenness. The inability of women to control wages, vote, or own property added to their vulnerability. Another contribution was related to the role of women in the home in the 19th century, which was largely to preside over the spiritual and physical needs of their homes and families. Because of this, women believed that it was their duty to protect their families from the danger of alcohol and convert their family members to the ideas of abstinence. This newfound calling to temperance, however, did not change the widely held viewpoint that women were only responsible for matters which pertained to their homes. Consequently, women had what Ruth Bordin referred to as the &quot;maternal struggle&quot; which women felt was the internal contradiction that came with their newly discovered power to make change, while still believing in their nurturing and domestic roles without yet understanding how to use their newly acquired power. June Sochen called women who joined movements such as women&#x27;s temperance organizations &quot;pragmatic feminists&quot;, because they took action to solve their grievances, but were not interested in altering traditional sex roles. The missionary organizations of many Protestant denominations gave women an avenue to work from; several all-female missionary societies already existed and it was easy for them to transform themselves into women&#x27;s temperance organizations.

In the 1870s and 1880s, the number of women who were in the middle and upper classes was large enough to support women&#x27;s participation in the temperance movement. Higher class women did not need to work because they could rely on their husbands&#x27; ability to support their families and they consequently had more leisure time to engage in organizations and associations that were affiliated with the temperance movement. The influx of Irish immigrants filled the servant jobs that freed African-Americans left after the American Civil War, leaving upper and middle-class women with even more time to participate in the community while domestic jobs were being filled. Moreover, the birth rate had fallen, leaving women with an average of four children in 1880 as compared to seven children at the beginning of the 19th century. The gathering of people in urban areas and the extra leisure time for women contributed to the mass female temperance movement.
The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) grew out of a spontaneous crusade against saloons and liquor stores that began in Ohio and spread throughout the Midwestern United States during the winter of 1873–1874. The crusade consisted of over 32,000 women who stormed into saloons and liquor stores in order to disrupt business and stop the sales of alcohol. The WCTU was officially organized in late November 1874 in Cleveland, Ohio. Frances Willard, the organization&#x27;s second president, helped grow the organization into the largest women&#x27;s religious organization in the 19th century. Willard was interested in suffrage and women&#x27;s rights as well as temperance, believing that temperance could improve the quality of life on both the family and community level. The WCTU trained women in skills such as public speaking, leadership, and political thinking, using temperance as a springboard to achieve a higher quality of life for women on many levels. In 1881, the WCTU began lobbying for the mandation of instruction in temperance in public schools. In 1901, schools were required to instruct students on temperance ideas, but they were accused of perpetuating misinformation, fear mongering, and racist stereotypes. Carrie Nation was one of the most extreme temperance movement workers and she was arrested 30 times for her &quot;hatchetations&quot; - using a hatchet to destroy property at bars, saloons, and even pharmacies, believing that even alcohol which was used for medicine was unjustified. At the approach of the 20th century, the temperance movement became more interested in legislative reform as pressure from the Anti-Saloon League increased. 
Women, who had not yet achieved suffrage, became less central to the movement in the early 1900s.

=== Other causes ===
Prohibition agendas also became popular among factory owners, who strove for more efficiency during a period of increased industrialization. For this reason, industrial leaders such as Henry Ford and S.S. Kresge supported Prohibition. The cause of the sober factory worker was related to the cause of women temperance leaders: concerned mothers protested against the enslavement of factory workers, as well as the temptation which saloons offered to these workers. Efficiency was also an important argument for the government because it wanted its soldiers to be sober.

At the end of the 19th century, temperance movement opponents started to criticize the slave trade in Africa. This criticism came during the last period of rapid colonial expansion. Slavery and the alcohol trade in colonies were seen as two closely related problems, and they were frequently called &quot;the twin oppressors of the people&quot;. Again, this subject tied in with the ideas of civilization and effectiveness: temperance advocates raised the issue that the &quot;natives&quot; could not be properly &quot;civilized&quot; and put to work, if they were provided with the vice of alcohol.

<text>The Bay of Skaill (from Old Norse &quot;Bugr Skála&quot;) is a small bay on the west coast of the Orkney Mainland, Scotland.

==Visitor attractions==
Bay of Skaill is the location of the famous Neolithic settlement, Skara Brae, and a large residence, Skaill House, the property of the laird on whose estate Skara Brae was discovered. Skaill House has connections with Captain James Cook.

==Skaill Viking hoard==
In March 1858, a boy named David Linklater was digging at Muckle Brae, near the Sandwick parish church, when he came across a few pieces of silver lying in the earth. Astounded by the find, Linklater was soon joined by a number of folk. Together they unearthed over one hundred items. This hoard is the largest Viking treasure trove found so far in Scotland.

<text>Red River is a 1948 American Western film, directed and produced by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift. It gives a fictional account of the first cattle drive from Texas to Kansas along the Chisholm Trail. The dramatic tension stems from a growing feud over the management of the drive between the Texas rancher who initiated it (Wayne) and his adopted adult son (Clift).

The film&#x27;s supporting cast features: Walter Brennan, Joanne Dru, Coleen Gray, Harry Carey, John Ireland, Hank Worden, Noah Beery Jr., Harry Carey Jr. and Paul Fix. Borden Chase and Charles Schnee wrote the screenplay based on Chase&#x27;s original story (which was first serialized in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1946 as &quot;Blazing Guns on the Chisholm Trail&quot;).

Upon its release, &quot;Red River&quot; was both a critical and commercial success and was nominated for two Academy Awards. In 1990, &quot;Red River&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; &quot;Red River&quot; was selected by the American Film Institute as the fifth-greatest Western of all time in the AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list in 2008.

==Plot==

In 1851, Thomas Dunson and his friend Nadine Groot leave St Louis on the California Trail. When they are just north of the Texas border, Dunson says he is going to leave the wagon train saying he will go south and start his ranch there. The trail boss says it isn&#x27;t safe as there are Indians around and he needs a good gunman like Dunson with the train. Dunson&#x27;s love interest Fen wants to join him but he tells her to stay with the wagons and he will send for her when he is properly settled. Before he and Groot leave, Dunson gives Fen his late mother&#x27;s bracelet.

Hours later, as Dunson and Groot reach the Red River (the Texas border), they spot smoke coming from the direction of the wagon train. That night they are attacked by Indians, but manage to kill them all. On the wrist of one, Dunson finds the bracelet he had given. The next day, teenager Matt Garth wanders into their camp, apparently the sole survivor of the wagon train. Dunson takes the boy with them. They enter Texas by crossing the river and four weeks later settle near the Rio Grande. Dunson names his new spread the Red River D, after his chosen cattle brand for his herd. He promises to add M (for Matt) to the brand, once Matt has earned it. Two men arrive and say they work for Don Diego who owns all the land from there south for four hundred miles (640 km). Dunson tells them to tell Don Diego that now all land north of the Rio Grande is his. One of the men draws on Dunson, who kills him. He tells the other to tell Don Diego what happened.

After fourteen years Dunson had built a successful ranch, but the Civil War has left him broke. His only option is to drive his herd of 10,000 head a thousand miles (1,609.3 km) to the railhead in Missouri, where he believes they will fetch a good price. Cherry Valance, a professional gunman, joins the drive. Valance relates that he has heard the railroad has reached Abilene, Kansas, which is much closer than Sedalia where they are heading. When Dunson confirms that Valance had not actually &quot;seen&quot; the railroad, he ignores the rumor in favor of continuing to Missouri.

One of the drovers, Bunk Kenneally, causes a stampede by accidentally making a lot of noise while sneaking sugar from one of the chuckwagons, resulting in the death of drover Dan Latimer. When Dunson attempts to whip him for causing the stampede, Kenneally draws his gun. Both Matt and Dunson draw, but Matt is faster, shooting and wounding Kenneally. Dunson confirms that he would have killed Kenneally. Valance tells Matt that he is soft for not shooting to kill.

Dunson keeps driving the men harder and harder and they get more and more disgruntled. They find the lone survivor from an earlier drive who says they should have followed the Chisholm Trail to Abilene. When Dunson presses him, he says he can&#x27;t remember for sure that the railway had reached Abilene, so Dunson says they will still go to Missouri. Three men say they have had enough and are going to leave the drive. Dunson says they agreed to finish when they signed on. There is a shootout and the three men are killed, with Matt helping Dunson. Three more men leave in the middle of the night, taking precious supplies with them. Dunson sends Valence to bring them back.

They cross the Red River and camp for the night. The next morning Valance returns with two of the three deserters, the other having tried to fight and being killed. When Dunson announces he intends to lynch them, Matt says he won&#x27;t allow it. Dunson tries to shoot Matt but is shot in the hand by Valance. With the support of the cowhands, Matt takes charge of the drive saying they will head for Abilene, leaving Dunson behind. Groot is the only one who offers to stay with Dunson, but is told to go with the drive. As they leave, Dunson says he will find Matt and kill him.

The drive saves a wagon train of gamblers and dance hall girls from an Indian attack. One of the girls, Tess Millay, becomes very interested in Matt, who is not interested, at first. With the weather getting worse, and the next river rising, Matt gets the drive moving on early the next morning. Eight days after they have left, Dunson arrives with some men he has hired to help him catch up with Matt. Dunson is surprised that Tess knows his name. Dunson notices she is wearing his mother&#x27;s bracelet. He tells Tess what he wanted a son to pass his ranch on to, and that was going to be Matt, until he stole the herd. He offers her half the ranch if she will bear him a son. She agrees, on the condition he abandons his pursuit of Matt, and when he says he won&#x27;t, she begs to go with him, to which he agrees.

When Matt reaches Abilene, he finds the town has been awaiting the arrival of such a herd to buy. He accepts an offer for the cattle, and later finds Tess in his room. She tells him Dunson is camped a few miles out of town. The next morning, as Dunson comes into town, he is challenged by Valance. They shoot each other, both getting wounded, but Dunson carries on towards Matt. He tells Matt to draw, but he refuses, even after Dunson has emptied his gun with near misses and grazing Matt&#x27;s cheek. He throws his gun away and does the same with Matt&#x27;s. Even when he starts punching him, Matt does not fight back, until eventually they both fight until Tess interrupts them. Making peace, Dunson advises Matt to marry Tess and tells him that when they get back to the ranch, he will incorporate an M into the brand, telling Matt that he has earned it.

==Production==

&quot;Red River&quot; was filmed in 1946, copyrighted in 1947, but not released until September 30, 1948. Footage from &quot;Red River&quot; was later incorporated into the opening montage of Wayne&#x27;s last film, &quot;The Shootist&quot;, to illustrate the backstory of Wayne&#x27;s character. The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Film Editing (Christian Nyby) and Best Writing, Motion Picture Story (Borden Chase). John Ford, who worked with Wayne on many films such as &quot;Stagecoach&quot;, &quot;The Searchers&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot;, was so impressed with Wayne&#x27;s performance that he is reported to have said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know the big son of a bitch could act!&quot;

Hawks felt Dru&#x27;s final speech after Dunson and Matt fight didn&#x27;t work, wishing his original choice to play Tess Margaret Sheridan had been available. He felt Sheridan could have done a far better job of delivering the lines than Dru did.

The film was shot in black and white rather than color, because director Howard Hawks found Technicolor technology to be too &quot;garish&quot; for the realistic style desired. But as with many remembrances of Hawks, he has also said the exact opposite to Peter Bogdanovich, to whom he claimed that he wished he had shot the picture in color, especially the sequence involving driving the cattle across the Red River. Had he done so, he thought it would have made a lot more money. Second unit director Arthur Rosson was given credit in the opening title crawl as co-director. He shot parts of the cattle drive and some action sequences. The film&#x27;s ending differed from that of the original story. In Chase&#x27;s original &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; story, published in 1946 as &quot;Blazing Guns on the Chisholm Trail&quot;, Valance shoots Dunson dead in Abilene and Matt takes his body back to Texas to be buried on the ranch.

=== Alternate versions ===
During the production and while the film was still being shot, Hawks was not satisfied with the editing and asked Christian Nyby to take over cutting duties. Nyby worked for about a year on the project. After production, the pre-release version was 133 minutes and included book-style transitions. This version was briefly available for television in the 1970s, but was believed to be lost. It was rediscovered after a long search as a Cinémathèque Française 35 mm print, and released by the Criterion Collection.

Before the film could be released, Howard Hughes sued Hawks, claiming that the climactic scene between Dunson and Matt was too similar to the film &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1943), which both Hawks and Hughes had worked on. Hughes prepared a new 127-minute cut, which replaced the book inserts with spoken narration by Walter Brennan. Nyby salvaged the film by editing in some reaction shots, which resulted in the original theatrical version. This version was lost, and the 133-minute pre-release version was seen on television broadcasts and home video releases. The original theatrical cut was reassembled by Janus Films (in co-operation with UA parent company MGM) for their Criterion Collection Blu-ray/DVD release on May 27, 2014.

Film historian Peter Bogdanovich interviewed Hawks in 1972, and he was led to believe that the narrated theatrical version was the director&#x27;s preferred cut. This view was upheld by Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien in his 2014 essay for the Criterion release. Contrarily, some, including film historian Gerald Mast, argue that Hawks preferred the 133-minute version. Mast points out that this is told from an objective third-person point of view, while the shorter cut has Brennan&#x27;s character narrating scenes he could not have witnessed. Filmmaker/historian Michael Schlesinger, in his essay on the film for the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry, argues that when Bogdanovich interviewed Hawks, the director &quot;was 76 and in declining health&quot;, when he was prone to telling tall tales. Schlesinger also points out that Hughes&#x27;s shortened version was prepared for overseas distribution because it is easier to replace narration than printed text.

==Soundtrack==

The song &quot;Settle Down&quot;, by musician Dimitri Tiomkin and lyricist Frederick Herbert, was heard over the credits and at various places throughout the film score. It was later adapted by Tiomkin with a new lyric by Paul Francis Webster as &quot;My Rifle, My Pony, and Me&quot; in the 1959 film &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; for an onscreen duet by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson as John Wayne and Walter Brennan look on.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a mostly positive review, praising the main cast for &quot;several fine performances&quot; and Hawks&#x27; direction for &quot;credible substance and detail.&quot; He only found a &quot;big let-down&quot; in the Indian wagon train attack scene, lamenting that the film had &quot;run smack into &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; in the form of a glamorized female, played by Joanne Dru.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a spectacle of sweeping grandeur&quot; with &quot;a first rate script,&quot; adding, &quot;John Wayne has his best assignment to date and he makes the most of it.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; found the film &quot;full of fine Western shots,&quot; with the main cast&#x27;s performances &quot;all first-rate.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;an epic of such sweep and magnitude that it deserves to take its place as one of the finest pictures of its type ever to come out of Hollywood.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 100% rating, based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10.

Roger Ebert considered it one of the greatest Western films of all time.

This movie was the last movie shown in the 1971 Peter Bogdanovich motion picture, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;.

In 1990, &quot;Red River&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

&quot;Red River&quot; was selected by the American Film Institute as the 5th greatest Western of all time in the AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list in 2008.

==&quot;Red River D&quot; belt buckles==
To commemorate their work on the film, director Howard Hawks had special Western belt buckles made up for certain members of the cast and crew of &quot;Red River&quot;. The solid silver belt buckles had a twisted silver wire rope edge, the Dunson brand in gold in the center, the words &quot;Red River&quot; in gold wire in the upper left and lower right corners, the initials of the recipients in the lower left corner, and the date &quot;1946&quot; in cut gold numerals in the upper right corner. Hawks gave full-sized (men&#x27;s) buckles to John Wayne, his son David Hawks, Montgomery Clift, Walter Brennan, assistant director Arthur Rosson, cinematographer Russell Harlan, and John Ireland. Joanna Dru and Hawks&#x27; daughter Barbara were given smaller (ladies&#x27;) versions of the buckle. According to David Hawks, other men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s buckles were distributed, but he can only confirm the family members and members of the cast and production team listed above received Red River D buckles.

Wayne and Hawks exchanged buckles as a token of their mutual respect. Wayne wore the Red River D belt buckle with the initials &quot;HWH&quot; in nine other movies: &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959), &quot;North to Alaska&quot; (1960), &quot;Hatari!&quot; (1962), &quot;McLintock!&quot; (1963), &quot;Circus World&quot; (1964), &quot;The Sons of Katie Elder&quot; (1965), &quot;El Dorado&quot; (1966), &quot;The War Wagon&quot; (1967) and &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; (1970). The actor did this even when he wasn&#x27;t filming under the direction of Howard Hawks, with one known exception: Apparently John Wayne didn&#x27;t wear the Red River belt buckle in films of John Ford.

In 1981, John Wayne&#x27;s son, Michael, sent the buckle to a silversmith, in order to have duplicates made for all of Wayne&#x27;s children. While in the silversmith&#x27;s care, it was stolen and has not been seen since. Red River D buckles, made by a number of sources, are among the most popular and sought after icons of John Wayne fans.

<text>Regeneration (alternately called The Regeneration) is a 1915 American silent biographical crime drama co-written and directed by Raoul Walsh. The film, which was the first full-length feature film directed by Walsh, stars Rockliffe Fellowes and Anna Q. Nilsson and was adapted for the screen by Carl Harbaugh and Walsh from the 1903 memoir &quot;My Mamie Rose&quot;, by Owen Frawley Kildare and the adapted 1908 play by Kildare and Walter C. Hackett.

It was feared lost until a copy was located by the Museum of Modern Art.

==Plot==
Cited as one of the first full-length gangster films, &quot;Regeneration&quot; tells the story of a poor orphan who rises to control the mob until he meets a woman for whom he wants to change.

The film is a &quot;candid adaptation&quot; of the autobiography of Owen Frawley Kildare, called the Kipling of the Bowery. The story follows the life of Owen (Rockliffe Fellowes), a young Irish American boy who is forced into a life of poverty after his mother dies. As a result, Owen is forced to live on the street eventually turning to a life of crime. Owen is eventually reformed, however, by the benevolent social worker Marie Deering (Anna Q. Nilsson). Also featured is a fire aboard an excursion ferry, much like the General Slocum disaster of 1904.

Deering&#x27;s choices perplex her beau, a district attorney (Harbaugh) who has declared war on the gangs.

==Cast==
* Rockliffe Fellowes – Owen Conway
* James A. Marcus – Jim Conway
* Anna Q. Nilsson – Marie &quot;Mamie Rose&quot; Deering
* Maggie Weston – Maggie Conway
* William Sheer – Skinny
* Carl Harbaugh – District Attorney Ames
* John McCann – Owen Conway (10 years old)
* Harry McCoy – Owen Conway (17 years old)

==Production==
Set in New York City, &quot;Regeneration&quot; was shot on location in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side and used real prostitutes, gangsters and homeless people as extras. It is the first produced by Fox Film Corporation, a forerunner of the 20th Century Fox.

By 1915, 28-year-old director Raoul Walsh was in New York, with a three-picture contract with Fox Film Corporation for $400 a week - he was assigned &quot;Regeneration&quot;, to be the first feature-length gangster film in the United States. It was based on the book &quot;My Mamie Rose&quot;. Walsh&#x27;s statement that he wrote the script was contradicted by other comments he made that he worked on it with Carl Harbaugh. Walsh had previously played John Wilkes Booth in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, and this was his first directing project on a feature, with him going on to film 140 other feature films.

When he filmed the scene with actors jumping off a boat into the river, fireboats and police showed up to calm the &quot;crowds&quot;, and Walsh was taken to the local station house, amused. The studio &quot;relished&quot; the free publicity. French cinematographer Georges Benoit worked on the film as his first Fox picture.

==Release==

&quot;Regeneration&quot; was originally released on September 13, 1915, to critical acclaim and was a box office hit. It was re-released to theaters on January 12, 1919.

The release was &quot;rife with the dramatic elements that pleased broad audiences of early cinema - violence and redemption, heavy sentiment, romance and tragedy&quot;. It opened to critical and box-office success. William Fox was so pleased, he bought Walsh a Simplex automobile and afforded him a salary of $800 a week, a small fortune in 1915. It cemented his reputation as an action director, although critics noted had &quot;had a gift for revealing emotional vulnerability in even his roughest, toughest heroes.&quot;

===Home media===
In 2001, &quot;Regeneration&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD by Image Entertainment, along with the 1915 film &quot;Young Romance&quot;. The same two-film set was released on manufactured-on-demand DVD by Image Entertainment in 2012. The film is in the public domain.

==Legacy==
&quot;Regeneration&quot; was previously thought to be lost but was rediscovered in the 1970s. A copy of the film is preserved and held by the Museum of Modern Art Department of Film and the Film Preservation Associates. TimeOut wrote that &quot;intriguingly, its eventful plotline is revealed as flatly contradicting the accepted synoptic account provided by Walsh in his autobiography. There the eventual fates of Nilsson and Fellowes are reversed, and an ending is transposed from another film entirely.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; says &quot;it&#x27;s a milestone in the history of the gangster film, and with its religious themes, mobile camerawork, and potent evocation of its grim locations, it&#x27;s the spiritual ancestor of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Time Out&quot; says it is notable for its &quot;remarkable approach to physical casting, a robust treatment of violent action, and a sheer narrative pace to shame contemporary ponderousness.&quot;

In 2000, &quot;Regeneration&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Republic Steel Strike Riot Newsreel Footage is a 1937 newsreel of the strike at Republic Steel on Memorial Day, May 30, 1937, which escalated into a massacre when Chicago police fired on protestors (1937 Memorial Day massacre). Ten protesters were killed by the police and thirty others suffered gunshot wounds. The police also used clubs and tear gas on the protesters. The film was produced by Paramount Pictures for their Paramount News series. In 1997, the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. The footage contained in the newsreel was illegally banned from being shown in Chicago by the Chicago Police Department for fear of causing unrest, and later the Paramount News company agreed to refrain from screening it elsewhere. The editor of Paramount News described the footage as &quot;not fit to be seen,&quot; and that allowing the public to view it in its entirety could &quot;incite local riot.&quot; However, clips from the footage were edited and released as a newsreel that framed the strikers as a violent mob.

<text>Return of the Secaucus 7 is a 1980 American independent drama film written and directed by John Sayles and starring Bruce MacDonald, Maggie Renzi, David Strathairn, Adam LeFevre, Maggie Cousineau, Gordon Clapp, and Jean Passanante, and others. The film tells the story of seven friends who spend a weekend together in New Hampshire. The weekend is marred by the break-up of a relationship between two of the friends. This causes a ripple effect among the group and brings up old desires and problems.

The picture was thought to have inspired &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), which is a more widely known film with a similar storyline. However, writer-director Lawrence Kasdan has denied having seen &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; before working on &quot;The Big Chill&quot;. In 1997, the film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress for its historic merits.

== Plot ==
Teachers Mike Donnelly (MacDonald) and Katie Sipriano (Renzi) prepare to host a gathering of their old college activist friends at their rural New Hampshire home. Frances (Cousineau), now in medical school, drives in with her old boyfriend, wannabe folk singer J.T. (LeFevre), who she found hitchhiking to the gathering. Irene (Passanante), a speechwriter for a Democratic U.S. senator, arrives with her conservative boyfriend, Chip (Clapp), who did not attend college with the others. Maura (Trott) says that she and Jeff (Arnott) are no longer a couple, which shocks the others and causes a somewhat uneasy first evening. Maura and J.T. are mutually attracted and have sex that night while Frances is nearby. The group attends a play that their old friend, Lacey, is acting in. Katie heckles Lacey, annoying Mike.

Jeff arrives and is apparently unaware that Maura has ended their relationship. This further strains the group&#x27;s cohesion, especially when J.T. tells Jeff he had sex with Maura, believing she was single. Jeff acknowledges being angry at J.T., but it does not end their friendship. After playing basketball and skinny-dipping with Mike&#x27;s high school friends, Ron (Strathairn) and Howie (Sayles), the group goes to a bar. Jeff and Maura get into a loud argument and Ron makes a pass at Frances, who is upset that J.T. and Maura were intimate. Ron and Frances leave for a local hotel, while Maura leaves by herself, and the rest of the group drives separately. Out on the road, the group come upon a deer carcass. An undercover cop arrests them on suspicion of illegal game hunting. While sitting in lock-up, the group recounts their various arrests during their college years and the formation of their nickname, the &quot;Secaucus 7&quot;. A local drunk confesses to hitting the deer, and everyone is released. The following day, the group leaves one-by-one, and J.T. insists on hitchhiking to Boston, refusing money from Maura for a bus ticket. Jeff is left alone, and angrily chops wood on Mike&#x27;s property. The film ends with Mike and Katie finding a farewell note from Jeff reading, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. --Jeff&quot;.

===Critical response===
Film critic Emanuel Levy liked the film and wrote, &quot;The movie became influential, launching a cycle of &quot;reunion&quot; films, which included &quot;The Big Chill&quot; and the TV series &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;. As a portrait of disenchantment, &quot;Return&quot; was more authentic and honest than Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s star-studded &quot;Big Chill&quot;...A rueful movie about unexceptional lives that have prematurely grown stale, &quot;Secaucus&quot; is a bit commonplace, lacking genuine drama. But Sayles uses effectively a discursive, episodic format; he constructs strong scenes with resonant dialogue. The characters are complex and individually distinguished by speech, gesture, and manner.&quot;

Critic Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat wrote, &quot;Here&#x27;s a nice little movie about the baby boom generation...Novelist John Sayles wrote, directed, and edited this movie. It is a labor of love. We watch these laidback individuals share their stories and reminisce about the past...But these baby boomers can&#x27;t handle tension; the rift between Jeff and Maura sends tremors through the weekend. And although they put up a front of having a good time, one senses that things haven&#x27;t turned out well for them — either in terms of meaningful relationships or in terms of personal fulfillment. &quot;Return of the Secaucus Seven&quot; leaves one with a rueful feeling about this generation.&quot;

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 81% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on sixteen reviews.

Film critic Aljean Harmetz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in her review: &quot;For a movie that cost $60,000, &quot;The Return of the Secaucus Seven&quot; is traveling in heady company. Most $60,000 movies play at two film festivals, then end up on a 16-millimeter projector in their director&#x27;s living room. &quot;The Return of the Secaucus Seven,&quot; about seven antiwar activists who spend a weekend together 10 years later, was the surprise hit of last spring&#x27;s Los Angeles Filmex festival. The movie was also selected as one of the 10 best films of 1980 by The Boston Globe, The Los Angeles Times and Time magazine, and last week it was nominated by the Writers Guild as best comedy written directly for the screen. When it opened an unsuccessful commercial run in New York last September, Vincent Canby, although expressing some reservations, praised the film as &quot;sweet and engaging&quot; and &quot;an honest, fully realized movie.&quot; Today it will try again, opening at the Quad in Greenwich Village this time.&quot;

===Release===
&quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; was released in United States theatres on September 5, 1980.

The film was first released for home entertainment by RCA/Columbia (VHS) and Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment (Betamax) in 1982.

It was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on September 16, 2003.

<text>Ride the High Country (released internationally as Guns in the Afternoon) is a 1962 American CinemaScope Western film directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, and Mariette Hartley. The supporting cast includes Edgar Buchanan, James Drury, Warren Oates, and Ron Starr. The film&#x27;s script, though credited solely to veteran TV screenwriter N.B. Stone Jr., was – according to producer Richard E. Lyons – almost entirely the work of Stone&#x27;s friend and colleague, William S. Roberts, and Peckinpah himself. 

In 1992, &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress as being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant

The film featured Scott&#x27;s final screen performance. After this film, Joel McCrea did not make another feature film until 1970. That year saw him make &quot;Cry Blood, Apache&quot;, with his son Jody. He appeared in The Young Rounders in 1972. His final film appearance was in 1976 in &quot;Mustang Country&quot;.

==Plot==
In the early 20th century, aging ex-lawman Steve Judd is hired by a bank to transport gold from a high country mining camp to the town of Hornitos. Six miners were recently murdered trying to transport a gold shipment. Judd was once respected, but his threadbare clothes and spectacles show that he is long past his prime. He enlists his old friend and partner Gil Westrum to guard the gold transfer. Gil, who makes his living claiming to be a legendary sharpshooter named The Oregon Kid, recruits his young sidekick, Heck Longtree.

The three men ride toward Coarsegold, the mining camp. Judd doesn&#x27;t realize that Gil and Heck plan to steal the gold. They stop for the night at the farm of Joshua Knudsen and his daughter Elsa. Knudsen is a domineering religious man who warns against those who &quot;traffic in gold&quot; and trades Bible verses with Judd at the dinner table. That night, Elsa and Heck secretly meet in the moonlight for conversation, but Knudsen catches them and pulls her away. Back at the house, he admonishes and slaps her.

The next morning, after the three men have left, she catches up and asks to ride with them. She is also going to Coarsegold, to marry a miner named Billy Hammond. Along the way, Elsa and Heck flirt, and at one time he tries to force himself on her. Heck is stopped by Judd, and then punched by both Judd and Gil. He later apologizes to Elsa.

When they reach Coarsegold, the two older men set up a tent to weigh and accept gold dust. Elsa and Billy are married in the camp&#x27;s brothelthe only substantial building thereby the retired Judge Tolliver. Billy forces Elsa to a room in the brothel for their wedding night, and strikes her when she resists. Dead drunk, he fails to prevent his brothers Elder, Sylvus, Jimmy, and Henry from entering the room and attempting to rape her. Hearing her screams, Judd and Heck rescue Elsa and let her stay in their tent overnight.

The next day, the miners of the camp organize an extrajudicial &quot;miner&#x27;s trial&quot; to make the outsiders return Elsa to her &quot;legal&quot; husband; because they are outnumbered, Judd agrees to the miners&#x27; demands. However, Gil rouses the drunken Tolliver, demands to see his license, then keeps it. He forces Tolliver at gunpoint to agree that when asked if he has a license to marry, he must say no (because Gil has it). The ruse works and the three men leave the camp with the gold and Elsa.

Along the way, Judd says to Gil that right and wrong are &quot;something you just know&quot;. After all his years working in disreputable places, he tells Gil that he&#x27;s grateful to have regained some of his self-respect. Realizing Judd will never agree to steal the gold, Gil plans to take it without his help. That night, as Gil and Heck prepare to leave with the gold, Judd confronts them at gunpoint. Heck gives up his gun immediately. Angered by Gil&#x27;s betrayal, Judd puts his gun away, then slaps Gil and challenges him to draw. Instead, Gil throws down his guns and accepts that Judd will turn him in when they return to town. Judd has to change his plans when the Hammonds appear looking for Elsa. They found out about the ruse and know that the marriage is legal. In the ensuing gunfight, Jimmy and Sylvus are killed, and Billy, Elder and Henry give up and escape.

During the night, Gil returns to the site of the gunfight, where he takes a horse and gun from one of the dead brothers. Then he follows Judd, Heck, and Elsa. Heck has shown himself to be trustworthy, and although he will probably go to prison, Elsa tells him she&#x27;ll be there when he gets out. When they reach Elsa&#x27;s farm, the Hammonds are waiting, having already killed her father. A gunfight breaks out and both Judd and Heck are wounded. Gil rides in to help his old friend, and together the pair challenge the brothers to a face-to-face shootout. When the dust settles, the Hammonds are dead, but Judd is mortally wounded. After forgiving Gil, Judd casts a look back towards the high country, then dies.

==Production==
The script, originally called &quot;Guns in the Afternoon&quot;, was written by N.B. Stone. Producer Richard Lyon was looking for a Western at MGM and William Roberts remembered Stone&#x27;s script. Lyons liked the story but had Roberts rewrite the script, as Stone refused to do so. Lyons then signed Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea to star. He was looking for a director and, impressed by episodes of &quot;The Westerner&quot;, signed Sam Peckinpah. Peckinpah also rewrote the script. 

The part of Billy Hammond was originally offered to Robert Culp who turned it down. James Drury played it instead.

Peckinpah flipped a coin in the presence of a producer to see which leading man got top billing, Scott or McCrea. Scott won the toss. However, in the opening credits, both stars&#x27; names are shown in the same shot, so both Scott and McCrea received equal top billing.

Filming began in October 1961.

==Reception==
The film was released on the bottom half of a double bill. William Goldman says he spoke to an MGM executive at the time who says the film had tested strongly but they felt the film &quot;didn&#x27;t cost enough to be that good&quot;.

According to MGM records, the film lost $160,000.

Seeing it as half of a double bill with &quot;The Tartars&quot;, Bosley Crowther greatly preferred &quot;Ride the High Country&quot;, calling it a &quot;perfectly dandy little Western&quot; and &quot;the most disarming little horse opera in months.&quot; According to Crowther:
The two young people are quite good, especially Miss Hartley, a newcomer with real promise. R. G. Armstrong and Edgar Buchanan also contribute telling bits. We know little about the director and scenarist, but Mr. Peckinpah and Mr. Stone certainly have what it takes. And so, if anybody ever doubted it, do a couple of leathery, graying hombres named McCrea and Scott.

&quot;Ride the High Country&quot; was hailed as a success upon its release in Europe. The film&#x27;s reputation has only grown in following years, with Peckinpah&#x27;s admirers citing it as his first great film. They also note that all of the themes of Peckinpah&#x27;s later films, such as honor and ideals compromised by circumstance, the difficulty of doing right in an unjust world, the destruction of the West and its heroes by industrial modernity, and the importance of loyalty between men are all present in &quot;Ride the High Country&quot;. In 1964 the film won the prestigious Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

In his autobiography &quot;In the Arena&quot; (1995), Charlton Heston wrote that he was considering remaking the film in the late 1980s, presumably with Clint Eastwood as a co-star, but after viewing &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; Heston proposed Harry Julian Fink&#x27;s script of &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965) to Peckinpah.

The original casting was for McCrea to play the Gil Westrum part and Randolph Scott to play Steve Judd. After reading the script the two men agreed that a switch of roles was in order.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Western Film

<doc id="76304" wikidata="Q2067313" url="?curid=76304" title="The River (1938 film)">
<text>The River is a 1938 short documentary film which shows the importance of the Mississippi River to the United States, and how farming and timber practices had caused topsoil to be swept down the river and into the Gulf of Mexico, leading to catastrophic floods and impoverishing farmers. It ends by briefly describing how the Tennessee Valley Authority project was beginning to reverse these problems.

It was written and directed by Pare Lorentz and, like Lorentz&#x27;s earlier 1936 documentary &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot;, was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, going into the registry in 1990. The film won the &quot;best documentary&quot; category at the 1938 Venice International Film Festival.

Both films have notable scores by Virgil Thomson that are still heard as concert suites, featuring an adaptation of the hymn &quot;How Firm a Foundation&quot;. The film was narrated by the American baritone Thomas Hardie Chalmers. Thomson&#x27;s score was heavily adapted from his own concert work &quot;Symphony on a Hymn Tune&quot;. &quot;The River&quot; later served as the score for the 1983 TV movie &quot;The Day After&quot;.

The two films were sponsored by the U.S. government and specifically the Resettlement Administration (RA) to raise awareness about the New Deal. The RA was folded into the Farm Security Administration in 1937, so &quot;The River&quot; was officially an FSA production.

There is also a companion book, &quot;The River&quot;. The text was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in poetry in that year.

<text>The Ring of Brodgar (or Brogar, or Ring o&#x27; Brodgar) is a Neolithic henge and stone circle about 6 miles north-east of Stromness on Mainland, the largest island in Orkney, Scotland. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Heart of Neolithic Orkney.

==General information==
The Ring of Brodgar (or Brogar, or Ring o&#x27; Brodgar) is a Neolithic henge and stone circle in Mainland, Orkney, Scotland. It is the only major henge and stone circle in Britain which is an almost perfect circle. Most henges do not contain stone circles; Brodgar is a striking exception, ranking with Avebury and Stonehenge among the greatest of such sites. The ring of stones stands on a small isthmus between the Lochs of Stenness and Harray. These are the northernmost examples of circle henges in Britain. Unlike similar structures such as Avebury, there are no obvious stones inside the circle, but since the interior of the circle has never been excavated by archaeologists, the possibility remains that wooden structures, for example, may have been present. The site has resisted attempts at scientific dating and the monument&#x27;s age remains uncertain. It is generally thought to have been erected between 2500 BCE and 2000 BCE, and was, therefore, the last of the great Neolithic monuments built on the Ness. A project called The Ring of Brodgar Excavation 2008 was undertaken in the summer of that year in an attempt to settle the age issue and help answer other questions about a site that remains relatively poorly understood. The results of the excavation are still preliminary.

The stone circle is in diameter, and the third largest in the British Isles. The ring originally had up to 60 stones, of which only 27 remained standing at the end of the 20th century. The tallest stones stand at the south and west of the ring, including the &quot;Comet Stone&quot; to the south-east. The stones are set within a circular ditch up to deep, wide and in circumference that was carved out of the solid sandstone bedrock by the ancient residents. Technically, this ditch does not constitute a true henge as there is no sign of an encircling bank of earth and rock. Many archaeologists continue to refer to this structure as a henge; for example, Aubrey Burl classifies the ditch as a Class II henge; one that has two opposing entrances, in this case on the north-west and south-east.

The ditch appears to have been created in sections, possibly by workforces from different parts of Orkney. The stones may have been a later addition, maybe erected over a long period of time.

Examination of the immediate environs reveals a concentration of ancient sites, making a significant ritual landscape. Within there are the two circle-henges, four chambered tombs, groups of standing stones, single stones, barrows, cairns, and mounds. The immediate area has also yielded a number of flint arrowheads and broken stone mace-heads that seem to date from the Bronze Age. Although its exact purpose is not known, the proximity to the Ness of Brodgar site and the Standing Stones of Stenness and its Maeshowe tomb beyond make the Ring of Brodgar a site of major importance.

The first formal survey of the Ring of Brodgar and surrounding antiquities was performed in 1849 by Royal Navy Captain F.W.L. Thomas of HM cutter &quot;Woodlark&quot;. Captain Thomas was in the area drawing up Admiralty Charts in 1848–49, and he and his crew performed archaeological surveys as well resulting in the publication in 1852 of &quot;The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney&quot;.

===Excavations of Neolithic ruins===

Ongoing excavations by Orkney College at the nearby Ness of Brodgar site located roughly midway between the Ring and the Stones of Stenness have uncovered several buildings, both ritual and domestic. Geophysics suggest there are likely to be more in the vicinity. Pottery, bones, stone tools and a polished stone mace head have also been discovered. Perhaps the most important find is the remains of a large stone wall which may have been long and up to wide. It appears to traverse the entire peninsula the site is on and may have been a symbolic barrier between the ritual landscape of the Ring and the mundane world around it.

==Nordic rites==

Invaders from Scandinavia reached Orkney by the 9th century, bringing a complex theology that they imposed on the preexisting Orcadian monuments; at least according to local legend. For example, the Ring of Brodgar and the Standing Stones of Stenness were allegedly known as the Temple of the Sun and Moon respectively. Young people supposedly made their vows and prayed to Wōden at these &quot;temples&quot; and at the so-called &quot;Odin Stone&quot; that lay between the stone circles until it was destroyed by a farmer in 1814. Others view these fanciful names with skepticism; Sigurd Towrie suggests that &quot;they were simply erroneous terms applied by the antiquarians of the 18th or 19th centuries – romantic additions, in the same vein as the infamous &quot;Druid&#x27;s Circle&quot; and &quot;Sacrificial Altar&quot;.&quot; At the very least, several of the stones at Brodgar contain runic carvings that were left by Nordic peoples. These include the name &quot;Bjorn&quot; and a small cross as well as an anvil.

==&quot;Megalithic Yard&quot; and Neolithic astronomers at Brodgar==

Burl notes that the diameter of the bank at Brodgar is almost exactly the same as the inner banks of the Avebury monument in England and the Newgrange ring in Ireland: 125 &quot;megalithic yards&quot; (MY), at per MY. This is a controversial unit originally proposed by Alexander Thom. Thom&#x27;s thesis, based on a statistical analysis of Neolithic monuments in the United Kingdom, is that the builders of these sites employed a common unit of measurement, although it has not been demonstrated how this information could have been shared.

Heggie casts doubt on this as well, stating that his careful analysis uncovered &quot;little evidence for a highly accurate unit&quot; and &quot;little justification for the claim that a highly accurate unit was in use&quot;. Thom and his father made other controversial contentions, for example, that Brodgar and the burial mounds that surround it were designed specifically as backsights for astronomical observations of the Moon. Graham Ritchie points out that the burial mounds have not been reliably dated, and he casts doubt on the astronomical prowess of the builders.

Euan MacKie suggested that the nearby village of Skara Brae might be the home of a privileged theocratic class of wise men who engaged in astronomical and magical ceremonies at sites like Brodgar and Stenness. Graham and Anna Ritchie cast doubt on this interpretation noting that there is no archaeological evidence for the claim, although a Neolithic &quot;low road&quot; connects Skara Brae with the chambered tomb of Maeshowe, passing near Brodgar and Stenness. Low roads connect Neolithic ceremonial sites throughout Britain.

==Conservation and access==
The site is a scheduled monument and was included in the &quot;Heart of Neolithic Orkney&quot; World Heritage Site in 1999.

===World Heritage status===
The Heart of Neolithic Orkney includes, in addition to the Ring of Brodgar, Maeshowe, Skara Brae, the Standing Stones of Stenness and other nearby sites. It is managed by Historic Environment Scotland, whose &#x27;Statement of Significance&#x27; for the site begins:

The monuments at the heart of Neolithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the triumphs of the human spirit in early ages and isolated places. They were approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt (first and second dynasties), the brick temples of Sumeria, and the first cities of the Harappa culture in India, and a century or two earlier than the Golden Age of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and with a remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol of the achievements of early peoples away from the traditional centres of civilisation...The Ring of Brodgar is the finest known truly circular late Neolithic or early Bronze Age stone ring and a later expression of the spirit which gave rise to Maeshowe, Stenness and Skara Brae
===Access===
Access at the Ring of Brodgar, especially to the inner ring, poses conservation issues. Site management has included periods of partial site closure, required to allow areas of footpath to recover.

==Cultural impact==

The Ring of Brodgar features in Kathleen Fidler&#x27;s 1968 novel &quot;The Boy with the Bronze Axe&quot;; here, it is depicted in a midsummer ceremony in which a lamb is sacrificed. In Fidler&#x27;s story, women are forbidden from entering the Ring, which is a male-only space.

In Troika Games 2001 title &quot;&quot;, the Ring of Brodgar appears in the town of Roseborough and is pivotal to the plot.

<text>Road to Morocco is a 1942 American comedy film starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour, and featuring Anthony Quinn and Dona Drake. Written by Frank Butler and Don Hartman and directed by David Butler, it’s the third of the &quot;Road to ...&quot; films. It was preceded by &quot;Road to Zanzibar&quot; (1941) and followed by &quot;Road to Utopia&quot; (1946). The story is about two fast-talking guys cast away on a desert shore and sold into slavery to a princess. In 1996, &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
A freighter explodes off the coast of North Africa under mysterious circumstances. All hands are accounted for save for stowaways Jeff Peters and Orville &#x27;Turkey&#x27; Jackson, the latter&#x27;s smoking habit causing the explosion. Upon reaching land, Orville reminds Jeff of his promise to Aunt Lucy to take care of him, but Jeff says she died before he could agree to it. Conveniently, a camel appears, and they hitch a ride.

As Jeff and Orville make their way into the city, they are nearly run over by Arabs led by Sheik Mullay Kasim, who has come to propose to Princess Shalmar. Orville is approached by men carrying a mysterious woman in a veiled palanquin, and her hand takes his before they leave. While at a restaurant, Jeff and Orville plan to skip out on the bill, but a man takes Jeff aside and gives him some money. Jeff has sold Orville, and although he is initially angry, he eventually calms down after Jeff promises to buy him back. Two men then throw a hood over Orville and carry him off.

Jeff has a vision of Aunt Lucy, who shames him for selling Orville. He attempts to buy Orville back but discovers that he has been sold once again. Aunt Lucy then advises Jeff to find Orville and suggests that he sing his favorite song. Jeff walks and sings until a note and Orville&#x27;s locket are thrown from the palace, warning him of danger. Jeff climbs over the palace wall and hears a woman singing. He sneaks in and finds Orville with Princess Shalmar and other beautiful girls.

Jeff storms into the palace but is caught by guards. Orville pretends not to know him, resulting in the princess dismissing everyone except Jeff. Orville then confesses to their engagement, but the princess reveals that she bought him and that her wise man advised her to marry him. The princess invites Jeff to stay, and Orville is waited on by girls, including Mihirmah, who confesses her love for him. Jeff confronts Orville, who then has him thrown out.

Later, Jeff sings and attracts the princess, and they go for a walk. Mihirmah tries to convince Orville to leave with her. Jeff tells the princess that he should be the one marrying her, but Orville threatens him with a sword. The following day, Kasim threatens to kill Orville, but the princess takes him to the wise man, who reveals a prophecy: the first husband will die a violent death within a week of marriage, and the second will have a long and happy life. The princess declares that Orville is the first husband, and Kasim finally understands.

Orville learns of the prophecy and runs off with Mihirmah, convincing Jeff that the princess actually loves him. That night, Aunt Lucy&#x27;s spirit rebukes Orville. Princess Shalmar refuses to marry Jeff and sends Orville away to prepare for the wedding. Later, the wise man tells the princess and Jeff that he misread the stars and that the prophecy is incorrect. Jeff now understands why Orville wanted to avoid the marriage, and tells him that the princess has changed her mind. Meanwhile, Kasim learns of the news and rallies his men.

Princess Shalmar and Jeff decide to get married in the United States along with Orville and Mihirmah. However, Kasim intervenes and abducts the princess while giving Mihirmah to one of his men. Jeff and Orville attempt to use their &#x27;patty-cake&#x27; routine on Kasim, but it fails, and they end up getting captured along with the girls.

Kasim leaves Jeff and Orville stranded in the desert and takes the women with him. While wandering in the desert, they discover an oasis near Kasim&#x27;s camp. They try to sneak in but are caught. They then witness a clash between two sheiks and take advantage of the chaos to escape with the girls. The four board a boat back home. However, things take a dangerous turn when Orville causes an explosion while smoking in the powder room. Fortunately, they all survive by clinging onto a pile of wreckage near New York Harbor.

==Reception==
The film was placed at No. 4 in the list of top-grossing movies for 1942 in the USA.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; liked it: &quot;Let us be thankful that Paramount is still blessed with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and that it has set its cameras to tailing these two irrepressible wags on another fantastic excursion, &quot;Road to Morocco&quot;, which came to the Paramount yesterday. For the screen, under present circumstances, can hold no more diverting lure than the prospect of Hope and Crosby ambling, as they have done before, through an utterly slaphappy picture, picking up Dorothy Lamour along the way and tossing acid wisecracks at each other without a thought for reason or sense...The short of it is that &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; is a daffy, laugh-drafting film. And you’ll certainly agree with the camel which, at one point, offers the gratuitous remark, &#x27;This is the screwiest picture I was ever in&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; commented: &quot;Crosby, Hope and Lamour have done it again. Their click in &quot;Road to Singapore&quot; and &quot;Road to Zanzibar&quot; is eclipsed by &quot;Road to Morocco&quot;... Crosby, of course, is still more or less straighting for Hope’s incessantly steaming gags. The two have never teamed better, nor have they, seemingly, romped with such abandon.&quot;

==Songs==
* &quot;(We&#x27;re Off on the) Road to Morocco&quot;, sung by Bing Crosby and Bob Hope
* &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got a Dime to My Name&quot;, sung by Bing Crosby
* &quot;Constantly&quot;, sung by Dorothy Lamour
* &quot;Moonlight Becomes You&quot;, sung by Bing Crosby, and later by Lamour, Hope, and Crosby

All lyrics to all songs are by Johnny Burke to music by Jimmy Van Heusen.

Bing Crosby recorded several of the songs for Decca Records. &quot;Moonlight Becomes You&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for two weeks during a 17-week stay in the lists. &quot;Constantly&quot; and &quot;(We&#x27;re Off on the) Road to Morocco&quot; also charted briefly. Crosby&#x27;s songs were also included in the Bing&#x27;s Hollywood series.

== Awards and honors ==
The picture received Oscar nominations for Best Sound Recording (Loren L. Ryder) and Best Writing, Original Screenplay. In 1996, &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies – Nominated
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #78
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;(We&#x27;re Off on the) Road to Morocco&quot; – #95
** &quot;Moonlight Becomes You&quot; – Nominated
* 2007: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – Nominated

== Legacy ==
In an NPR interview, Middle East expert Dr. Jack Shaheen of Southern Illinois University cites &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; as &quot;one of the most stereotypical films ever to come out of Hollywood.&quot; The films themselves were spoofing the popular adventure movies of the time, however.

== History ==
&quot;Road to Morocco&quot; featured the first affectionate interracial kiss (between Bob Hope and Dona Drake) in film. Previously in 1934, the movie &quot;Java Head&quot; had a quick kiss between married characters Anna Mae Wong and Gerrit Ammidon.

<doc id="76309" wikidata="Q167745" url="?curid=76309" title="Allison V-1710">
<text>The Allison V-1710 aircraft engine designed and produced by the Allison Engine Company was the only US-developed V-12 liquid-cooled engine to see service during World War II. Versions with a turbocharger gave excellent performance at high altitude in the twin-engined Lockheed P-38 Lightning, and turbo-superchargers were fitted to experimental single-engined fighters with similar results.

The United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) preference for turbochargers early in the V-1710&#x27;s development program meant that less effort was spent on developing suitable mechanically driven centrifugal superchargers for the Allison V-12 design, as other V-12 designs from friendly nations like the British Rolls-Royce Merlin were already using.

When smaller-dimensioned or lower-cost versions of the V-1710 were desired, they generally had poor performance at higher altitudes. The V-1710 nevertheless gave excellent service when turbocharged, notably in the P-38 Lightning, which accounted for much of the extensive production run.

==Design and development==

The Allison Division of General Motors began developing an ethylene glycol-cooled engine in 1929 to meet a USAAC need for a modern, , engine to fit into a new generation of streamlined bombers and fighters. To ease production, the new design could be equipped with different propeller gearing systems and superchargers, allowing a single production line to build engines for various fighters and bombers.

The United States Navy (USN) hoped to use the V-1710 in its rigid airships &quot;Akron&quot; and &quot;Macon&quot;, but both were equipped with German-built Maybach VL II engines as the V-1710 was still in testing when the &quot;Macon&quot; was lost in February 1935 (the &quot;Akron&quot; having been lost in April 1933). The USAAC purchased its first V-1710 in December 1932. The Great Depression slowed development, and it was not until December 14, 1936, that the engine next flew in the Consolidated XA-11A testbed. The V-1710-C6 successfully completed the USAAC &quot;150 hour Type Test&quot; on April 23, 1937, at , the first engine of any type to do so. The engine was then offered to aircraft manufacturers where it powered the prototype Curtiss XP-37s. All entrants in the new pursuit competition were designed around it, powering the Lockheed P-38, Bell P-39 and Curtiss P-40. When war material procurement agents from the United Kingdom asked North American Aviation to build the P-40 under license, NAA instead proposed their own improved aircraft design, using the V-1710 in their NA-73.

==Technical description==
The V-1710 has 12 cylinders with a bore and stroke of in 60° V format, for a displacement of , with a compression ratio of 6.65:1. The valvetrain has a single overhead camshaft per bank of cylinders and four valves per cylinder.

===Versatility and reversibility of rotation===
The engine design benefited from the General Motors philosophy of built-in production and installation versatility, embracing a philosophy of modular design for aviation powerplants. The engine was constructed around a basic power section, from which different installation requirements could be met by fitting the appropriate accessories section at the rear, and an appropriate power output drive at the front. A turbo-supercharger could be used, if desired.

The P-39, P-63, and Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster used V-1710-Es, exchanging the integral reduction gear for an extension shaft driving a remotely located reduction gear and propeller. Aircraft such as the P-38, P-40, P-51A, and North American P-82E used close-coupled propeller reduction gears, a feature of the V-1710-F series.

The accessory end had a one- or two-speed engine-driven supercharger that might have a second stage with or without an intercooler, the ignition magnetos and the customary assortment of oil and fuel pumps, all dictated by the application requirements. The front of the engine could have one of a number of different output drives. The drive might be a &quot;long-nose&quot; or close coupled propeller reduction gear, an extension drive to a remote gearbox, or a gearbox that could drive two wing-mounted propellers from a fuselage-mounted engine. Another key feature of the V-1710 design was its ability to turn the output shaft clockwise or counter-clockwise by assembling the engine with the crankshaft turned end-for-end, by installing an idler gear in the drive train to the supercharger, camshafts, and accessories, installing a starter turning the proper direction, and re-arranging the ignition wiring on the right side to accommodate a changed firing order. No change to the oil pump nor coolant pump circuits was needed. The ability to reverse the direction of rotation with a minimum of extra parts to achieve the task allowed the use of either a &quot;tractor&quot; or &quot;pusher&quot; propeller. This approach allowed easy changes of the supercharger(s) and supercharger drive-gear ratio. That gave different critical altitude (the maximum altitude at which the engine could produce full power) ratings ranging from .

===Supercharger===

The V-1710 has often been criticized for not having a &quot;high-altitude&quot; supercharger. The comparison is usually to the later, two-stage, versions of the Rolls-Royce Merlin 60-series engines also built by Packard as the V-1650 and used in the P-51B Mustang and subsequent variants. The USAAC had specified that the V-1710 was to be a single-stage supercharged engine and, if a higher altitude capability was desired, the aircraft could use their newly developed turbo-supercharger as was featured in the XP-37(YP-37), P-38, and XP-39.

The benefits of a two-stage supercharger eventually became so clear that Allison did make some efforts in this direction. Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger in various configurations to the existing engine-mounted supercharger and carburetor. Early versions of these two-stage supercharger engines were used on the P-63. No intercooler, aftercooler, or backfire screen (flame trap) were incorporated into these two-stage V-1710 engines (except for the V-1710-119 used on the experimental P-51J, which had an aftercooler). The two-stage Merlin engines had all of these features, which were designed to prevent detonation from charge heating and backfire into the supercharger. The G-series V-1710s installed on the F-82 E/F/G models had only anti-detonation injection (ADI) to deal with these problems, and not surprisingly had severe reliability and maintenance problems. In one record, it was stated that the F-82 required 33 hours of maintenance for each hour of flight.

Although the early V-1710 powered P-39, P-40 and P-51A were limited to combat operations at a maximum of about they were available in comparatively large numbers and were the mainstay of some Allied Air Forces in all but the European theater of war. The engines proved to be robust and little affected by machine-gun fire. In total, over 60 percent of the post-June 1941 USAAF&#x27;s pursuit aircraft operated during WWII were powered by the V-1710.

Allison slowly but continuously improved the engine during the war. The initial rating of was incrementally increased; the final V-1710-143/145(G6R/L) was rated for . By 1944, the War Emergency Power rating on the P-38L was .

The most powerful factory variant was the V-1710-127, designed to produce at low altitude and at . This engine was static tested at and was planned for installation in an XP-63H aircraft. The end of the war ended this development, so this promising experiment never flew. The extra power of this version was derived from using exhaust turbines, not to drive a turbo-supercharger, but to return that energy to turning the crankshaft, called a turbo-compound engine.

Improvements in manufacturing brought the cost to produce each engine from $25,000 down to $8,500 and allowed the installed lifetime of the engine to be increased from 300 hours to as much as 1,000 hours for the less-stressed power-plants. Weight increases needed to accomplish this were minimal, with the result that all models were able to produce more than 1 hp/lb (1.6 kW/kg) at their takeoff rating.

There was also a high degree of commonality of parts throughout the series. The individual parts of the Allison series were produced to a high degree of standardization and reliability, using the best technology available at the time. Even after the war, racing Merlins used Allison connecting rods. As stated previously, General Motors&#x27; policies regarding versatility meant that their Allison division would also employ modular design features on the V-1710 from its &quot;long block&quot; core V-12 unit outwards, so that it was capable of being mated to many different styles of turbo-superchargers and various other accessories, although the variety of turbo-superchargers available for installation was limited due to the constraints of single-engine fighter design. Since it was produced in large numbers and was highly standardized, the engine has been used in many postwar racing designs. Its reliability and well-mannered operation allowed it to operate at high rpm for extended periods.

Following the war, North American built 250 P-82E/F for air defense roles into the early 1950s. This was the final military role for the V-1710.

===Turbo-supercharger===
The USAAC had earlier decided to concentrate on turbo-superchargers for high altitude boost, believing that further development of turbo-superchargers would allow their engines to outperform European rivals using crankshaft driven superchargers. Turbo-superchargers are powered by the engine exhaust and so do not draw much power from the engine crankshaft, whereas displacement superchargers are coupled directly by shafts and gears to the engine crankshaft. Turbo-superchargers do increase the exhaust back-pressure and thus do cause a very small decrease in engine power, but the power increase due to increased induction pressures more than makes up for that decrease. Crankshaft-driven superchargers require an increase in directly driven percentage of engine power as altitude increases (the two-stage supercharger of the Merlin 60 series engines consumed some at . General Electric was the sole source for research and production of American turbo-superchargers during this period, from its four decades worth of steam turbine engineering experience.

Turbo-superchargers were highly successful in U.S. bombers, which were exclusively powered by radial engines. The P-47 fighter had the same combination of radial engine (R-2800) and turbo-supercharger and was also successful, apart from its large bulk, which was caused by the need for the ductwork for the aft-mounted turbo-supercharger.

However, mating the turbocharger with the Allison V-1710 proved to be problematic. As a result, designers of the fighter planes that used the V-1710 were invariably forced to choose between the poor high-altitude performance of the V-1710 versus the increased problems brought on by addition of the turbo-supercharger. The fates of all of the V-1710 powered fighters of World War II would thus hinge on that choice.

The original XP-39 was built with a V-1710 augmented by a General Electric Type B-5 turbo-supercharger as specified by Fighter Projects Officer Lieutenant Benjamin S. Kelsey and his colleague Gordon P. Saville. Numerous changes were made to the design during a period of time when Kelsey&#x27;s attention was focused elsewhere, and Bell engineers, NACA aero-dynamic specialists and the substitute fighter project officer determined that dropping the turbocharger would be among the drag reduction measures indicated by borderline wind tunnel test results; an unnecessary step, according to aviation engineer and historian Warren M. Bodie. The production P-39 was thus stuck with poor high-altitude performance and proved unsuitable for the air war in Western Europe which was largely conducted at high altitudes. The P-39 was rejected by the British, but used by the U.S. in the Mediterranean and the early Pacific air war, as well as shipped to the Soviet Union in large numbers under the Lend Lease program. The Soviets were able to make good use of P-39s because of its excellent maneuverability and because the air war on the Eastern Front in Europe was primarily short ranged, tactical, and conducted at lower altitudes. In the P-39, Soviet pilots scored the highest number of individual kills made on &quot;any&quot; American, or British fighter type. The P-40, which also had only the single-stage, single-speed-supercharged V-1710, had similar problems with high-altitude performance.

The P-38 was the only fighter to make it into combat during World War II with turbo-supercharged V-1710s. The operating conditions of the Western European air war – flying for long hours in intensely cold weather at – revealed several problems with these engines. They had a poor manifold fuel-air distribution and poor temperature regulation of the turbo-supercharger air, which resulted in frequent engine failures (detonation occurred as the result of persistent uneven fuel-air mixture across the cylinders caused by the poor manifold design). Specially formulated fuels were a necessity for the P-38 as were specific spark plugs needed for specific cylinders. The turbo-supercharger had additional problems with getting stuck in the freezing air in either high or low boost mode; the high boost mode could cause detonation in the engine, while the low boost mode would be manifested as power loss in one engine, resulting in sudden fishtailing in flight. These problems were aggravated by sub-optimal engine management techniques taught to many pilots during the first part of WWII, including a cruise setting that ran the engine at high RPM and low manifold pressure with a rich mixture. These settings can contribute to over-cooling of the engine, fuel condensation problems, accelerated mechanical wear, and the likelihood of components binding or &quot;freezing up.&quot; Details of the failure patterns were described in a report by General Doolittle to General Spatz in January 1944. In March 1944, the first Allison engines appearing over Berlin belonged to a group of P-38Hs of 55th Fighter Group, engine troubles contributing to a reduction of the force to half strength over the target. It was too late to correct these problems in the production lines of Allison or GE, and as the numbers of Merlin-engined P-51 Mustangs based in England mounted up through the end of 1943 and into 1944, the P-38s were steadily withdrawn from Europe until October 1944 when they were no longer used for bomber escort duty with the Eighth Air Force. A few P-38s would remain in the European theater as the F-5 for photo reconnaissance.

The P-38 had fewer engine failures in the Pacific Theater, where operating techniques were better developed (such as those recommended by Charles Lindbergh during his development work in the theater),) and the Japanese did not operate at such high altitudes. Using the same P-38Gs which were proving difficult to maintain in England, Pacific-based pilots were able to use the aircraft to good advantage including, in April 1943, Operation Vengeance, the interception and downing of the Japanese bomber carrying Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. New P-38 models with ever-increasing power from more advanced Allisons were eagerly accepted by Pacific air groups.

When Packard started building Merlin V-1650 engines in America in 1942, certain American fighter designs using the Allison V-1710 were changed to use the Merlin. The P-40F, a Lend Lease export to Britain, was one of the first American fighters to be converted to a Packard-Merlin engine. However, the installed engine was the V-1650-1 (a Packard-produced Merlin XX) with a slightly improved single-stage, two-speed supercharger, yielding only modest gains over the Allison V-1710.

The last Allison powered P-51, the Mustang I(II)/P-51A, used the single-stage, single-speed Allison V-1710-81, with a 9.6:1 blower ratio. This allowed the P-51A to reach a maximum speed of at and maintain at . This was more than faster than the Merlin 45-powered Spitfire V at , and more than faster at . Its speed impressed the British, and the RAF quickly realized the airplane would possess excellent high altitude performance if the Allison V-1710 engine were replaced by the 60-Series Merlin. A similar proposal to cure the P-38&#x27;s problems by replacing its Allisons with Merlins was quashed by the USAAF, after protests from Allison. 
Starting with the V-1710-45 around 1943 (after the P-51 had been fitted with a Merlin 61 by Rolls-Royce), Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger to some of its engines in an effort to improve high-altitude performance. The two-stage supercharged Allison was essentially developed as an &quot;add on&quot; to the single-stage engine, and required minimal changes to the base engine. While it lacked the refinement, compactness and after-cooler of the two-stage Merlin, the Allison used a pressure-altitude governed variable-speed first stage. Various configurations of this auxiliary supercharger were used in production versions of the V-1710 that powered aircraft such as the Bell P-63 and North American P-82E/F/G series. In addition, it was tried or studied as the powerplant for many experimental and test aircraft such as the Curtiss XP-55 Ascender, North American XP-51J &quot;lightweight Mustang&quot;, Boeing XB-38 Flying Fortress, and Republic XP-47A (AP-10), both of the latter with turbo-superchargers.

==Post-war==

The V-1710-powered F-82 did not arrive in time for World War II, but did see brief action in the Korean War, although the type was completely withdrawn from Korea by the end of 1950. It had a short service life that was probably due to a combination of factors: poor reliability from the G-series V-1710 engines, low numbers of F-82s produced, and the arrival of jet fighters. The initial production P-82B had Merlin engines, but North American was forced to use the Allison V-1710 for the E/F/G models when Rolls Royce required a &quot;Royalty&quot; of $6,500.00 per engine and the U. S. Government stopped buying the Merlin engine because of the excessive cost.

In total, 69,305 V-1710s were built by Allison during the war, all in Indianapolis, Indiana.

==Other uses==
The V-1710&#x27;s useful life continued, as thousands were available on the surplus market. In the 1950s, many drag racers and land speed racers, attracted by its reliability and good power output, adopted the V-1710; Art Arfons and brother Walt in particular used one, in &quot;Green Monster&quot;. It proved unsuccessful as a drag racing engine, being unable to accelerate rapidly, but &quot;could taxi all day at 150&quot;. Unlimited hydroplane racing also became a big sport across the U.S. at this time and V-1710s were often tuned for racing at up to —power levels that were beyond design criteria and significantly reduced durability.

Later, as purpose-built V8 engines became available for drag racing and unlimited boats shifted to turboshaft power, tractor pullers began using the Allison engine, again developing unimagined power. Finally, the warbird movement began to restore and return to the air examples of the classic fighters of the war and many V-1710-powered pursuit airplanes began to fly again, with freshly overhauled engines. The reliability, maintainability, and availability of the engine has led others to use it to power flying examples of aircraft whose original engines are unobtainable. This includes newly manufactured Russian Yak-3 and Yak-9 airplanes, originally powered by Klimov V-12s in World War II and the two (so far) airworthy examples of the Ilyushin Il-2, taking the place of the Mikulin V-12 it originally used, as well as ambitious projects such as a replica Douglas World Cruiser and Focke-Wulf Fw 190D by Flug Werk of Germany.

==Variants==

Allison&#x27;s internal model designation for the V-1710 started with the letter A and proceeded to the letter H. Each letter designated a family of engines that shared major components, but differed in specific design details. Each of these designs were identified by a number, starting with number 1. The last letter, which was introduced when both right hand turning and left hand turning engines were built, identified by the letter R or L respectively.

The military model numbers were identified by a &quot;dash number&quot; following the engine description &quot;V-1710&quot;. The USAAC/USAAF models were the odd numbers, starting with &quot;-1&quot; and the USN models were the even numbers, starting with &quot;-2&quot;.
&quot;A&quot; series engines were early development engines for the USN and USAAC. The first military model was a single V-1710-2, which was first sold to the USN on June 26, 1930. The &quot;A&quot; engines had no counterweights on the crankshaft, 5.75:1 compression ratio, 2:1 internal spur gear-type reduction gear boxes, 8.77:1 supercharger ratio, impeller, SAE #50 propeller shaft, a float-type carburetor, and produced at 2800 rpm on 92 octane gasoline.
&quot;B&quot; series engines were designed for USN airships. The military model was V-1710-4. They differed from the &quot;A&quot; series engines in that they did not have a supercharger, had two float-type down-draft carburetors were mounted directly to the intake manifold, an SAE #40 propeller shaft, and could be brought from full power to stop and back to full power in the opposite rotation in less than 8 seconds. They produced at 2400 rpm.
&quot;C&quot; series engines were developed for highly streamlined pursuit aircraft for the USAAC, and are easily identified by the long reduction gear case. The military models were V-1710-3, -5, -7, -11. -13, -15, -19, -21, -23, -33, producing between at 2600 rpm. These engines came in two groups, one group rated at full power at sea level, the other rated at full power at high altitude. The altitude rating difference was in the supercharger gear ratio, four of which were used: 6.23:1, 6.75:1, 8.0:1 and 8.77:1. These engines received heavier crankcases, a stronger crankshaft, SAE #50 propeller shaft, and Bendix pressure carburetors.
&quot;D&quot; series engines were designed for pusher applications using propeller-speed extension shafts and remote thrust bearings mounted to the airframe. The military models were V-1710-9, -13, -23, and -41, producing at 2600 rpm. Supercharger ratios were 6.23:1, 8.0:1 or 8.77:1, depending on altitude rating. These engines had the compression ratio increased to 6.65:1. Marvel MC-12 fuel injection, which was unsatisfactory and quickly replaced by a float-type carburetor on -9 and -13 models. Later dash number engines used Bendix pressure carburetors. These engines were being designed at the same time as the V-3420 engine, and shared many assemblies as they were developed. The &quot;D&quot; series engines were the last of the &quot;early&quot; V-1710 engines.
&quot;E&quot; series engines were designed for remote gearbox applications using crankshaft-speed extension shafts and remote 1.8:1 gearboxes with SAE #60 hollow propeller shafts. The military models were V-1710-6, -17, -31, 35, -37, -47, -59, -63, -83, -85, -93, -103, -109, -117, -125, -127, -129, -133,-135 and -137, producing at 3000 rpm. Supercharger gear ratios were: 6.44:1, 7.48:1, 8.10:1, 8.80:1 and 9.6:1 depending on altitude rating. These engines were a complete redesign, and did not share many components with the earlier engine series. Almost all components were interchangeable with later series engines and the V-3420, and could be assembled as right hand or left hand turning engines in either pusher or tractor applications.

&quot;F&quot; series engines were designed for late model pursuit aircraft, and are identified by the compact external spur gear-type reduction gear box. Military models were V-1710-27, -29, -39, -45, -49, -51, -53, -55, -57, -61, -75, -77, -81, -87, -89, -91, -95, -99, -101, -105, -107, -111, -113, -115, -119, producing at 3000 rpm. The V-1710-101, -119 and -121 models has an auxiliary supercharger, some with a liquid-cooled aftercooler. Supercharger gear ratios were: 6.44:1, 7.48:1, 8.10:1, 8.80:1 and 9.60:1 depending on altitude rating. These engines had either a six or twelve weight crankshaft, revised vibration dampeners that combined to allow higher engine speeds, SAE #50 propeller shaft, and higher horsepower ratings. The &quot;E&quot; series and &quot;F&quot; series engines were very similar, the primary difference being the front crankcase cover, which was interchangeable between the two series engines.
&quot;G&quot; series engines were designed for high-altitude pursuit aircraft, and are identified by the auxiliary supercharger with a Bendix &quot;Speed-Density&quot; fuel control. Military models were V-1710-97, -131, -143, -145, and -147, producing at 3000 rpm. Supercharger gear ratios were: 7.48:1, 7.76:1, 8.10:1, 8.80:1 and 9.60:1 depending on altitude rating. These engines were equipped with an SAE #50 propeller shaft and a single power lever to regulate engine performance, reducing the pilot&#x27;s workload when managing this very complex engine.
&quot;H&quot; series engines were to use a two-stage supercharger driven by a two-stage air-cooled power recovery turbine. The engine was to have an aftercooler and port-type fuel injection. This variant, however, was never built.

<doc id="76310" wikidata="Q201293" url="?curid=76310" title="Roman Holiday">
<text>Roman Holiday is a 1953 American romantic comedy film directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Audrey Hepburn as a princess out to see Rome on her own and Gregory Peck as a reporter. Hepburn won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance; the film also won the Academy Award for Best Story and the Academy Award for Best Costume Design.

The script was written by Dalton Trumbo and John Dighton, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit, and Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo&#x27;s name was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003, and on December 19, 2011, full credit for Trumbo&#x27;s work was restored. Blacklisted director Bernard Vorhaus worked on the film as an assistant director under a pseudonym.

The film was shot at the Cinecittà studios and on location around Rome during the &quot;Hollywood on the Tiber&quot; era. The film opened the 14th Venice International Film Festival within the official program.

In 1999, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film has been considered one of the most romantic films in cinema history.

==Plot==
Crown Princess Ann is on a tightly-scheduled tour of European capital cities for her unnamed nation. After an especially hard day in Rome, her doctor gives her an injection and advises: &quot;Best thing I know is to do exactly what you wish for awhile.&quot; She secretly leaves the embassy to explore the city and, as the drug takes effect, falls asleep atop a low wall, where Joe Bradley, an American reporter, finds her. Not recognizing her, he thinks she is intoxicated and takes her to his apartment to sleep it off.

Joe oversleeps and misses the princess&#x27;s scheduled press conference, but claims to his editor, Hennessy, that he attended. Hennessy shows him a news item about the cancellation of the press conference due to the princess&#x27;s &quot;sudden illness&quot;. Joe realizes the woman in his apartment is the princess from the newspaper photograph, and asks Hennessy what he would pay for an exclusive interview with her. Hennessy offers $5000, and counters with a $500 bet that Joe will not be able to get it.

Joe calls his photographer friend, Irving Radovich, and offers to show &quot;Anya&quot; around Rome, without revealing that he is a reporter and that he knows her true identity. Ann cites an important appointment and leaves. Joe follows and sees her explore an outdoor market, buy shoes, and get her long hair cut short. Joe contrives to meet her on the Spanish Steps and convinces her to spend the day with him, taking her to a street café to meet up with Irving, who takes pictures with a camera concealed in his cigarette lighter. Ann claims to be playing truant from school. When Ann clumsily drives a Vespa through Roman traffic with Joe as a passenger, they are arrested, but Joe and Irving show their &quot;fake&quot; press passes and are released. They tour the Colosseum. Joe then takes Ann to the Mouth of Truth and tells her the legend attached to it: if a liar puts their hand in the mouth, it will be bitten off. After Ann tries it after hesitating, it is Joe&#x27;s turn, and he startles her by pretending that his hand was cut off.

As they attend a dance on a boat that her barber had invited her to, agents from Ann&#x27;s government try to forcibly take her back. Ann joins Joe, Irving, and the barber to fight them, and smashes a guitar over one of the pursuers heads. When Joe is knocked into the river, Ann jumps in after him. They swim away and kiss as they sit shivering on the riverbank. While drying their wet clothes at Joe&#x27;s apartment, a radio bulletin says that the people of Ann&#x27;s country are concerned that her illness may be serious. Ann asks Joe to drive her to a corner near the embassy, where they kiss again. She bids him a tearful farewell.

Upon her return, the princess replies to those attempting to remind her of her duty, &quot;Were I not completely aware of my duty to my family and my country, I would not have come home tonight...or indeed ever again.&quot;

Joe tells a disbelieving Hennessy that he did not get the story, but tells Irving he cannot stop him from selling the photographs. Joe and Irving attend the rescheduled press conference, to Ann&#x27;s surprise. She asserts her faith in relations between nations just as between people, and Joe assures her that her faith is not misplaced. When asked which city she most enjoyed visiting, she begins to say it would be difficult before declaring &quot;Rome. By all means, Rome.&quot; Other photographers take pictures with their large press cameras, while Irving makes a show of using his cigarette lighter. Ann speaks briefly with each journalist, and Irving presents her with his photographs as a memento of Rome. Joe remains behind after everyone else leaves, before walking from the room.

==Cast==
==Casting==
Wyler first offered the role to Hollywood favorite Cary Grant. Grant declined, believing he was too old to play Hepburn&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest, though he would do so ten years later in &quot;Charade&quot;. Other sources say Grant declined because he knew all of the attention would be centered on the princess. Peck&#x27;s contract gave him solo star billing, with newcomer Hepburn listed much less prominently in the credits. Halfway through the filming, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate her to equal billing—an almost unheard-of gesture in Hollywood.

Wyler had initially considered Elizabeth Taylor and Jean Simmons for the princess role, but both were unavailable. On 18 September 1951, director Thorold Dickinson made a screen test with Hepburn and sent it to director William Wyler, who was in Rome preparing &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. Wyler wrote to Dickinson, saying that &quot;as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her.&quot; &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; was not Hepburn&#x27;s first acting role, as she had appeared in Dutch and British films from 1948 and on stage, but it was her first major film role and her first appearance in an American film. Wyler wanted an &quot;anti-Italian&quot; actress who was different from the curvy Italian stars of that era: She was perfect; his new star had, in words attributed to Wyler, &quot;no arse, no tits, no tight-fitting clothes, no high heels. In short a Martian. She will be a sensation.&quot;

==Filming locations==

The Italian Ministry of Tourism had originally refused permission for the movie to be filmed in Rome on the grounds that it would &quot;degrade Italians&quot;. Once the matter was resolved, filming took place entirely in Rome and in the studios of Cinecittà. Wyler wanted to shoot the film in color, but doing so on location was so expensive that it had to be done in black and white.

Locations include:
* Mouth of Truth, Piazza Bocca della Verità, Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin
* Caffè Rocca, Piazza della Rotonda and Pantheon
* Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo
* Trevi Fountain
* Piazza Venezia
* Piazza di Spagna
* Spanish Steps
* Trinità dei Monti
* Colosseum
* Tiber river
* Via Margutta 51, the location of Joe&#x27;s apartment where he hosts Princess Ann
* Via dei Fori Imperiali
* Via della Stamperia 85, the barber shop where Ann has her hair cut
* Palazzo Colonna Gallery, shown in the final scenes of the princess&#x27;s press appearance
* Palazzo Brancaccio, the princess&#x27; ornate Roman bedroom.

==Reception==
The film opened the 14th Venice International Film Festival on August 20, 1953. It opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on August 27, 1953, grossing $165,000 in its first week. The film also opened the same week in two theatres in Portland, Oregon, on a double bill with &quot;Murder Without Tears&quot;, grossing $14,000.

The film received critical acclaim from reviewers of its initial release. Milton Luban of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the movie &quot;proves a charming, laugh-provoking affair that often explodes into hilarity... it has a delightful screenplay that sparkles with wit and outrageous humor that at times comes close to slapstick&quot; and that the &quot;cinematographers do a fine job of incorporating Roman landmarks into the storyline&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that it was &quot;a natural, tender and amusing yarn&quot; with &quot;laughs that leave the spirits soaring&quot;.

&quot;Roman Holiday&quot; was the second most popular film at the US box office during September 1953 behind &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;, grossing almost $1 million. It earned an estimated $3 million at the United States and Canadian box office during its first few months of release, and a total of $5 milion. While the domestic box office disappointed Paramount, it was very successful elsewhere, including the UK, where the film benefited from both the current romance between Princess Margaret and commoner Peter Townsend—&quot;No film studio could have bought such publicity&quot;, Alexander Walker wrote—and a fad for Italian culture. It earned around $12 milion in the overseas market.

Due to the film&#x27;s popularity, both Peck and Hepburn were approached about filming a sequel, but this project never got off the ground.

The film has been well received, with a 95% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, based on 63 reviews with an average rating of 8.50/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;With Audrey Hepburn luminous in her American debut, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; is as funny as it is beautiful, and sets the standard for the modern romantic comedy.&quot; It is considered a classic by twenty-first-century viewers and reviewers. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the film is a &quot;modern fairytale whose two leads have a charm and innocence that irradiate the whole movie&quot;, giving the film five out of five. &quot;Empire&quot; concluded that the film is a &quot;timeless, exuberant classic, with Hepburn&#x27;s naïve sense of fun and perfectly charming performance matched equally by Peck&#x27;s louche and charismatic worldy American&quot;. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling the movie a &quot;staple of the romantic comedy fan&#x27;s library&quot;, and &quot;remains one of only a few black-and-white movies that modern audiences willingly watch&quot;.

The film was very popular outside of the United States. As late as of 1990, it was cited as the favorite foreign film of all time for Japanese audiences.

==Awards and nominations==
* The Academy Award for Best Story was initially given to Ian McLellan Hunter, since he took story credit on behalf of Dalton Trumbo (who was blacklisted). The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences later credited the win to Trumbo, and in 1993 Trumbo&#x27;s widow, Cleo, received her late husband&#x27;s Oscar.
* In 1999, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.
* The American Film Institute lists the film at No. 4 in its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions, and at No. 4 in the romantic comedy category in its AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10.

==Adaptations==
A number of films were later claimed to be based on &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;, or likened to it. They include
the Malayalam &quot;Kilukkam&quot; (1991), the Tamil-language &quot;May Madham&quot; (1994), and &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999) - which a review described as &quot;a 90&#x27;s London-set version of &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;&quot;

When Lewis Gilbert was making &quot;The Adventurers&quot; for Paramount, he said Charles Bludhorn, whose company owned the studio, wanted the director to make a musical remake of &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; with songs by the Sherman Brothers. Gilbert agreed but said Paramount then got &quot;cold feet&quot; and the film was cancelled. The director went on to make &quot;Seven Nights in Japan&quot; (1976), which was in the style of &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;. Paramount Pictures has since licensed three musical adaptations of &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;: Toho&#x27;s Japanese version of 1998; Teatro Sistina&#x27;s &quot;Vacanze romane&quot; (2004), using the Cole Porter score, supplemented with music by Armando Trovajoli, which has since toured Italy and Spain; and the American stage version of 2012, described as a jukebox musical using the songs of Cole Porter.

<doc id="76311" wikidata="Q451801" url="?curid=76311" title="Rose Hobart">
<text>Rose Hobart (born Rose Kefer; May 1, 1906 – August 29, 2000) was an American actress and a Screen Actors Guild official.

==Early years==
Born in New York City, Hobart was the daughter of a cellist in the New York Symphony Orchestra, Paul Kefer, and an opera singer, Marguerite Kefer. Her parents&#x27; divorce when she was seven resulted in Hobart and her sister, Polly, going to France to live with their grandmother. When World War I began, they came back to the United States and went to boarding schools. By 1921, she was a student at Kingston High School in Kingston, New York.

== Career ==
When Hobart was 15, she debuted professionally in &quot;Cappy Ricks&quot;, a Chautauqua production. She was accepted for the 18-week tour because she told officials that she was 18. At that same age, she was cast in Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot;, which opened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Hobart&#x27;s Broadway stage debut was on September 17, 1923 at the Knickerbocker Theater, playing a young girl in &quot;Lullaby&quot;. In 1925, she played Charmian in &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;.

Hobart was an original member of Eva Le Gallienne&#x27;s Civic Repertory Theatre. In 1928, she made her London debut, playing Nina Rolf in &quot;The Comic Artist&quot;. During her career in theater, she toured with Noël Coward in &quot;The Vortex&quot; and was cast opposite Helen Hayes in &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot;.

Her performance as Grazia in &quot;Death Takes a Holiday&quot; won her a Hollywood contract. Hobart appeared in more than 40 motion pictures over a 20-year period. Her first film role was the part of Julie in the first talking picture version of &quot;Liliom&quot;, made by Fox Film Corporation in 1930, starring Charles Farrell in the title role, and directed by Frank Borzage. Under contract to Universal, Hobart starred in &quot;A Lady Surrenders&quot; (1930), &quot;East of Borneo&quot; (1931), and &quot;Scandal for Sale&quot; (1932). On loan to other studios, she appeared in &quot;Chances&quot; (1931) and &quot;Compromised&quot; (1931). In 1931, she co-starred with Fredric March and Miriam Hopkins in Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s original film version of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1931). She played the role of Muriel, Jekyll&#x27;s fiancée. In 1936, Surrealist artist Joseph Cornell, who bought a print of &quot;East of Borneo&quot; to screen at home, became smitten with the actress, and cut out nearly all the parts that did not include her. He also showed the film at silent film speed and projected it through a blue-tinted lens. He named the resulting work &quot;Rose Hobart&quot;. Hobart often played the &quot;other woman&quot; in movies during the 1940s, with her last major film role in &quot;Bride of Vengeance&quot; (1949).

===Politics===
The House Un-American Activities Committee investigated Hobart in 1949, effectively ending her career. She believed that she first came to the attention of anti-Communist activists because of her commitment to improving working conditions for actors in Hollywood. In 1986, she recalled that &quot;On my first three pictures, they worked me 18 hours a day and then complained because I was losing so much weight that they had to put stuff in my evening dress... When I did &quot;East of Borneo&quot; (1931), that schlocky horror [film that] I did, we shot all night long. They started at 6 o&#x27;clock at night and finished at 5 in the morning. For two solid weeks, I was working with alligators, jaguars and pythons out on the back lot. I thought, &#x27;This is acting?&#x27; It was ridiculous. We were militant about the working conditions. We wanted an eight-hour day like everybody else.&quot;

Hobart also served on the board of the Screen Actors Guild and was an active participant in the Actors&#x27; Laboratory Theatre, a group which anti-Communists like Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed was subversive. In 1948, Hobart was subpoenaed to appear before the Tenney Committee on Un-American Activities. Although Hobart was not a member of the Communist Party, she refused to cooperate, instead reading a prepared statement that concluded, &quot;In a democracy no one should be forced or intimidated into a declaration of his principles. If one does yield to such pressure, he gives away his birthright. I am just mulish enough not to budge when anyone uses force on me.&quot; In 1950, Hobart was also listed in the anti-Communist blacklisting publication, &quot;Red Channels&quot;. Hobart never worked in film again, although she did work on stage, and, later as the blacklist eased, in the 1960s, she took on television roles, including a part on &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

===Personal life===
Hobart was married three times. Her first marriage, to Benjamin L. Winter, ended in divorce in 1929. On October 9, 1932, she married William Mason Grosvenor, Jr., an executive in a chemical engineering firm. They were divorced on February 17, 1941. She had one child, son Judson Bosworth, from her third marriage to architect Barton H. Bosworth.

===Later years===
In 1994, Hobart published her autobiography, &quot;A Steady Digression to a Fixed Point&quot;.

==Death==
On August 29, 2000, Hobart died at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California, aged 94, from natural causes. She was survived by her only child, son Judson Bosworth (b. 1949).

<text>Safety Last! is a 1923 American silent romantic-comedy film starring Harold Lloyd. It includes one of the most famous images from the silent-film era: Lloyd clutching the hands of a large clock as he dangles from the outside of a skyscraper above moving traffic. The film was highly successful and critically hailed, and it cemented Lloyd&#x27;s status as a major figure in early motion pictures. It is still popular at revivals, and it is viewed today as one of the great film comedies.

The film&#x27;s title is a play on the common expression &quot;safety first&quot;, which describes the adoption of safety measures as a means to avoid accidents, especially in workplaces. Lloyd performed some of the climbing stunts himself, despite having lost a thumb and forefinger four years earlier in a film accident.

In 1994, &quot;Safety Last!&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. It is one of many works from 1923 that notably entered the public domain in the United States in 2019, the first time any works had done so in 20 years.

==Plot==
In 1922, Harold Lloyd is behind bars. His mother and his girlfriend, Mildred, are consoling him as a somber official and priest show up. The three of them walk toward what looks like a noose. It then becomes obvious they are at a train station and the &quot;noose&quot; is actually a trackside pickup hoop used by train crews to receive orders without stopping, and the bars are merely the ticket barrier. He promises to send for his girlfriend so they can get married once he has &quot;made good&quot; in the big city. Then he is off.

He gets a job as a salesclerk at the De Vore Department Store, where he has to pull various stunts to get out of trouble with the picky and arrogantly self-important head floorwalker, Mr. Stubbs. He shares a rented room with his pal &quot;Limpy&quot; Bill, a construction worker.

When Harold finishes his shift, he sees an old friend from his hometown who is now a policeman walking the beat. After he leaves, Bill shows up. Bragging to Bill about his supposed influence with the police department, he persuades Bill to knock the policeman backwards over him while the man is using a callbox. When Bill does so, he knocks over the wrong policeman. To escape, he climbs up the façade of a building. The policeman tries to follow, but cannot get past the first floor; in frustration he shouts at Bill, &quot;You&#x27;ll do time for this! The first time I lay eyes on you again, I&#x27;ll pinch you!&quot;

Meanwhile, Harold has been hiding his lack of success by sending his girlfriend expensive presents he cannot really afford. She mistakenly thinks he is successful enough to support a family and, with his mother&#x27;s encouragement, takes a train to join him. In his embarrassment, he has to pretend to be the general manager, even succeeding in impersonating him to get back at Stubbs. While going to retrieve her purse (which Mildred left in the manager&#x27;s office), he overhears the real general manager say he would give $1,000 to anyone who could attract people to the store. He remembers Bill&#x27;s talent and pitches the idea of having a man climb the &quot;12-story Bolton building&quot;, which De Vore&#x27;s occupies. He gets Bill to agree to do it by offering him $500. The stunt is highly publicized and a large crowd gathers the next day.

When a drunkard shows &quot;The Law&quot; (the policeman who was pushed over) a newspaper story about the event, the lawman suspects Bill is going to be the climber. He waits at the starting point despite Harold&#x27;s frantic efforts to get him to leave. Finally, unable to wait any longer, Bill suggests Harold climb the first story himself and then switch his hat and coat with Bill, who will continue on from there. After Harold starts up, the policeman spots Bill and chases him into the building. Every time Harold tries to switch places with Bill, the policeman appears and chases Bill away. Each time, Bill tells his friend he will meet him on the next floor up.

Eventually, Harold reaches the top, despite his troubles with some hungry pigeons, a net, several cheering girls, an old lady, a construction duo, a clock, a rope, a dog, a mouse, a gun man, and a wind gauge, he finally kisses his girl. While they walk away, Harold accidentally steps in a tar pit and loses his boots and socks.

==Cast==
* Harold Lloyd as Harold Lloyd
* Mildred Davis as The Girl
* Bill Strother as The Pal, &quot;Limpy&quot; Bill
* Noah Young as The Law
* Westcott Clarke as Mr. Stubbs, The Floorwalker 
* Earl Mohan as The Drunk 
* Mickey Daniels as The Newsboy 
* Anna Townsend as The Grandma

==Production==

Lloyd hanging from a giant clock on the corner of a building was seen as an iconic image for him, though it was achieved through a certain degree of improvisation. Lloyd performed most of his own stuntwork, but a circus performer was used when The Boy hangs by a rope, and a stunt double – sometimes Bill Strother, who played &quot;Limpy&quot; Bill and was a steeplejack who inspired the sequence when Lloyd saw him climbing – was used in long shots. The giant clock scene was filmed on the roof of Broadway Leasehold Building, as was the final shot of the film.

A number of buildings from 1st Street to 9th Street in downtown Los Angeles, all of different heights, were used, with sets built on their roofs to match the facade of the main building, the International Bank Building at Temple and Spring Streets. In this way, the illusion of Lloyd climbing higher and higher up the side of one building was created (although the streetscapes seen beyond the sets are noticeably different at different stages of the climb).

Stuntman Harvey Parry also appeared in the climactic sequence, a fact he revealed only after Lloyd&#x27;s death. In the 1980 Thames Television series &quot;Hollywood&quot;, he discussed at length how the stunts were achieved.

==Reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; gave &quot;Safety Last!&quot; a very positive review. A contemporary review in &quot;Photoplay&quot; predicted the film&#x27;s future: &quot;This new Harold Lloyd farce will become a classic of its kind, or we will miss our guess. For it is the bespectacled comedian&#x27;s best effort to date.&quot; &quot;This is easily one of the big comedies of the year. It is seven-reels in length—but it speeds by with the rapidity of a corking two-reeler,&quot; the reviewer concluded.

The Library of Congress added &quot;Safety Last!&quot; to its National Film Registry in 1994. The American Film Institute nominated the film for both their 1998 and 2007 lists of &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies&quot;. It was also nominated for &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs&quot;. It placed #97 on &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 97% from 70 reviews, with the consensus: &quot;Persuasive enough to give audiences acrophobia when they aren&#x27;t laughing at Harold Lloyd&#x27;s antics, &quot;Safety Last!&quot; is a marvel of visual effects and slapstick comedy.&quot; 
==Home video==
The film was released in multiple versions on home video, both on VHS and DVD. It was released via the Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray on June 18, 2013.

<doc id="76314" wikidata="Q2586674" url="?curid=76314" title="Salesman (1969 film)">
<text>Salesman is a 1969 direct cinema documentary film, directed by brothers Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, about door-to-door Bible salesmen.

==Synopsis==
The documentary follows four salesmen as they travel across New England and southeast Florida, trying to sell large, expensive Bibles door-to-door in low-income neighborhoods, and attend a sales meeting in Chicago. The film focuses in particular on salesman Paul Brennan, a middle-aged Irish-American Catholic from Jamaica Plain, Boston, who struggles to maintain his sales.

==Cast==
* Paul Brennan, &quot;The Badger&quot;
* Charles McDevitt, &quot;The Gipper&quot;
* James Baker, &quot;The Rabbit&quot;
* Raymond Martos, &quot;The Bull&quot;
* Kennie Turner, Bible Sales Manager
* Melbourne I. Feltman, Theological Consultant (1905-1982)
* Margaret McCarron, Motel Maid

==Production==
The Maysles brothers wanted to be the first to make a nonfiction feature film (which turned out to be &quot;Salesman&quot;) after learning that Truman Capote had made the claim that his newly released book &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; was a nonfiction novel. The film was made on a low budget; just under seven minutes into the film, one of the two cameras used can be seen in the shot, which was not unusual for a documentary film. The handheld microphone used to record the film&#x27;s sound is visible in other shots, also not unusual in a documentary setting.

The Maysles brothers self-funded &quot;Salesman&quot;, costing approximately $100,000. The brothers paid each salesman $100, along with their expenses. During production, the crew consisted of Albert Maysles shooting and lighting and David Maysles doing sound. Albert Maysles never prompted anyone for the film, except when he asked Brennan to describe his fellow salesmen. In determining whom and what they would film, the Maysles brothers consulted the salesmen&#x27;s schedules. Throughout production, the Maysles brothers sent footage to Zwerin, who viewed it and provided feedback. When post-production began, David Maysles and Zwerin tried to structure a story about the four salesmen, but found they did not have the material. Instead, they realized that they were dealing with a story about Brennan.

The Maysles brothers had themselves been door-to-door salesmen in the past, selling everything from cosmetics to encyclopedias. While filming, they became part of the pitch, telling those who let the salesmen and the camera crew into their homes that they were now part of &quot;a human interest story.&quot;

Elements of popular culture that appear as backdrops to the main story include the song &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot; from &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;; a recorded orchestral performance of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Yesterday&quot;; &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;; the theme music of the television series &quot;Ben Casey&quot;; and televised boxing matches.

As stated in the closing credits,
:The filming team of Albert and David Maysles went home to Boston to take another look at the kind of people they grew up with. The idea for the film was researched and developed by David Maysles[,] who found the salesmen. The photography was by Albert Maysles. The film was edited by David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin.

&quot;Salesman&quot; was filmed in January 1967 (perhaps also late December 1966) and bears a copyright date of 1968.

==Distribution==
The Maysles brothers faced challenges in showing the completed film. As they tried to arrange distribution, they were told that the content was too depressing and realistic for the public. The brothers self-distributed through their production company, Maysles Films, and they booked theaters for screenings. The first theatrical screening occurred on April 17, 1969, at the 68th Street Playhouse in New York City.

==Reception==

At the time of the documentary&#x27;s initial release, the film critic for &quot;New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby, praised both its content and structure in his April 18, 1969 review: Documentary filmmaker James Blue once said of Albert Maysles that &quot;his cinema is one in which ethics and aesthetics are interdependent, where beauty starts with honesty, where a cut or a change in camera angle can become not only a possible aesthetic error, but also a &#x27;sin&#x27; against truth.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; included &quot;Salesman&quot; on his list of the ten best films of 1970. In late 1970, however, Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; expressed her problems with the film in her negative review of the Maysles&#x27; subsequent documentary &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. She insists in that same review that &quot;Salesman&quot; is not truly direct cinema and alleges that the production was &quot;set up&quot; and that its principal characters are effectively acting. Kael even accuses the Maysles of &quot;recruit[ing] Paul Brennan, who was in the roofing and siding business, to play a bible salesman.&quot; In response, the Maysles threatened to sue &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for libel and rebutted Kael&#x27;s claims in an open letter sent to the magazine. Since &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s policy at the time prohibited the publication of such correspondence, the letter did not appear in print until 1996, when it was included in the appendix to the anthology &quot;Imagining Reality: The Faber Book of Documentary&quot;. The letter, which is signed by all three of the film&#x27;s credited directors, states in part:

==Legacy==
In 1992, &quot;Salesman&quot; was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; The film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2018.

<doc id="76320" wikidata="Q2115816" url="?curid=76320" title="Salomé (1923 film)">
<text>Salomé is a 1923 American silent drama film directed by Charles Bryant and Alla Nazimova, who also stars. It is an adaptation of the 1891 Oscar Wilde play of the same name. The play itself is a loose retelling of the biblical story of King Herod and his execution of John the Baptist (here, as in Wilde&#x27;s play, called Jokanaan) at the request of Herod&#x27;s stepdaughter, Salomé, whom he lusts after.

&quot;Salomé&quot; is often called one of the first art films to be made in the United States. The highly stylized costumes, exaggerated acting, minimal sets, and absence of all but the most necessary props make for a screen image much more focused on atmosphere and on conveying a sense of the characters&#x27; individual heightened desires than on conventional plot development.

==Plot==

The film starts by giving context for the banquet we are about to see unfold. We are informed that the Tetrarch murdered his brother to obtain the throne and for access to his brother&#x27;s (now his) wife and daughter. 

At some point after this coup, Jokanaan arrived from the desert speaking of the upcoming birth of Christ, as well as the infidelity of The Tetrarch&#x27;s wife, Herodias. With his wife furious, The Tetrarch locks Jokanaan away to protect him from great mobs. 

We then discuss Salomé, daughter of Herodias, who is described as &quot;... An uncontaminated blossom in a wilderness of evil&quot;, but despite this, is known as a girl who is unafraid to kill and does it as a form of affection. After this context, we are brought to Herod&#x27;s palace, where the Tetrarch displays his intense obsession with his stepdaughter and niece Salomé, angering Herodias. Salomé escapes this scenario by entering the courtyard from the banquet hall and charms a young guard to allow her to see Jokanaan. 

He is, after much struggle, then brought up from his prison below. Salomé bridles a deep obsession for the Prophet. After he ignores her affections, she expresses her intent to kiss him. This causes the young guard Salomé had previously charmed to take a blade to his chest. Unnerved by this, Salomé continues to pester Jokanaan, causing him to retreat back to his prison. This infuriates Salomé, and she waits just outside his cell door. Seeking out his stepdaughter, The Tetrarch stumbles out into the courtyard and finds the body of the young guard. This horrifies him, as he did not order for anyone to be killed. 

After the initial horror subsides, The Tetrarch orders for the banquet to be served outside, so Salomé is visible while he eats. He begs her to join and dance for him and his guests, promising anything she desires. Salomé realizes she can use this to kill the man she love, Jokanaan, as she knows her stepfather would keep him safe in his cage otherwise, and her mother despises him as well. 

Salomé then performs The Dance of the Seven Veils, which greatly pleases The Tetrarch. In return for this, Salomé asks for Jokanaan&#x27;s head to be delivered to her on a silver platter. The Tetrarch is horrified by this request and offers multiple alternatives to the request, but being cheered on by her mother, Salomé insists on the head of Jokanaan. When delivered the head, Salomé hides it under her long train and kisses it, finally doing what she had desired from the beginning. 

Seeing this, The Tetrarch orders the execution of Salomé. Guards rush her with spears and the final card shown is the words &quot;THE MYSTERY OF LOVE IS GREATER THAN THE MYSTERY OF DEATH!&quot;

==Cast==
* Alla Nazimova as Salomé, Stepdaughter of Herod
* Mitchell Lewis as Herod Antipas, Tetrarch of Judea
* Rose Dione as Herodias, wife of Herod
* Earl Schenck as Narraboth, Captain of the Guard
* Arthur Jasmine as Page of Herodias
* Nigel De Brulier as Jokanaan, the Prophet
* Frederick Peters as Naaman, the Executioner
* Louis Dumar as Tigellinus

==Production==
Despite the film being only a little over an hour in length and having no real action to speak of, it cost over $350,000 to make. All the sets were constructed indoors to be able to have complete control over the lighting. The film was shot completely in black and white, matching the illustrations done by Aubrey Beardsley in the printed edition of Wilde&#x27;s play. The costumes, designed by Natacha Rambova, used material only from Maison Lewis of Paris, such as the real silver lamé loincloths worn by the guards.

No major studio would be associated with the film, and it was years after its completion before it was released, by a minor independent distributor. It was a complete failure at the time and marked the end of Nazimova&#x27;s producing career.
==Gay cast rumor== 
There is a longstanding rumor, which seems to have started while the film was still in production and has been asserted by chronicler of Hollywood decadence Kenneth Anger, that the film&#x27;s cast is composed entirely of gay or bisexual actors in an homage to Oscar Wilde, as per star and producer Nazimova&#x27;s demand. 

It is, of course, impossible to say, but one of the extras in &quot;Salomé&quot; reported that a number of the cast members—both featured and extras—were indeed gay, but not an unusual percentage of them, and certainly not all of them. What can be said is that Nazimova herself was usually thought of as a lesbian (despite occasional flings with men including Paul Ivano), the two guard characters (who, next to Salomé, have the most screen time) are at least played very stereotypically gay, and several of the female courtiers are men in drag.

According to Vito Russo&#x27;s &quot;The Celluloid Closet&quot;, some scenes in which homosexuality was exposed more explicitly were cut out, including one showing the relationship between two Syrian soldiers.

==Critical reception and legacy ==
A reviewer for &quot;Screenland&quot; described &quot;Salomé&quot; as &quot;a painting deftly stroked upon the silversheet&quot; and that &quot;poets and dreamers will find imaginative delights in the weird settings and the still more weird acting, depressing at times to ordinary folks. And it is worth something to watch Nazimova balance her Christmas-tree headdress!&quot;

&quot;Photoplay&quot; did not know quite what to make of the film. Calling Wilde’s original story “a hot-house orchid of decadent passion,” the review was skeptical of the film adaptation:
&quot;We are not sure whether we like Madame Nazimova’s idea of Salome as a petulant little princess with a Freudian complex and a headdress of glass bubbles. We rather believe such a Salome would not have stirred men so in those good old pagan days. You have our warning: this is bizarre stuff.&quot;

&quot;Salomé&quot; was screened in 1989 at the New York International Festival of Lesbian and Gay films and in 1990 at the New York Gay Experimental Film Festival.

In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Salomé&quot; became available on DVD as a double feature with the avant garde film &quot;Lot in Sodom&quot; (1933) by James Sibley Watson and Melville Webber.

In 2013 &quot;Salomé&quot; was screened at the Ojai Music Festival, where the Bad Plus performed a live improvised soundtrack.

The film was nominated in 2001 by the American Film Institute for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions.

<doc id="76325" wikidata="Q512618" url="?curid=76325" title="Salt of the Earth (1954 film)">
<text>Salt of the Earth is a 1954 American film drama written by Michael Wilson, directed by Herbert J. Biberman, and produced by Paul Jarrico. Because all three men were blacklisted by the Hollywood establishment due to their alleged involvement in communist politics, &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was one of the first fully independent films made outside of the Hollywood studio system.

It was also one of the first motion pictures to advance the feminist social and political point of view. Its plot centers on a long and difficult strike, based on the 1951 strike against the Empire Zinc Company in Grant County, New Mexico. The company is identified as &quot;Delaware Zinc&quot;, and the setting is &quot;Zinc Town, New Mexico&quot;. The film shows how the miners, the company, and the police react during the strike. Shot in a style influenced by Italian neorealism, and making atmospheric use of New Mexico&#x27;s landscapes, &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; employed mostly local miners and their families as actors.

The film was initially mired in Red Scare controversy and was suppressed. Eventually though, it was seen by more and more people until it came to be recognized as an important cultural, political and aesthetic work. In 1992, it was selected to the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Film Registry of significant U.S. films.

==Plot==

Esperanza Quintero is a miner&#x27;s wife in Zinc Town, New Mexico, a community which is essentially run and owned by Delaware Zinc, Inc. Esperanza is thirty-five years old, pregnant with her third child and emotionally dominated by her husband, Ramón Quintero. We know from her concern about her &quot;onomásticos&quot; or &quot;día de mi/su santo&quot; (a.k.a. Name Day) that it is 12 November as that is the &quot;onomásticos&quot; of persons named Esperanza.

The majority of the miners are Mexican-Americans and want decent working conditions equal to those of white or &quot;Anglo&quot; miners. The unionized workers go on strike, but the company refuses to negotiate and the impasse continues for months. Esperanza gives birth and, simultaneously, Ramón is beaten by police and jailed on bogus assault charges following an altercation with a union worker who betrayed his fellows. When Ramón is released, Esperanza tells him that he&#x27;s no good to her in jail. He counters that if the strike succeeds, they will not only get better conditions right now but also win hope for their children&#x27;s futures.

The company presents a Taft-Hartley Act injunction to the union, meaning any miners who picket will be arrested. Taking advantage of a loophole, the wives picket in their husbands&#x27; places. Some men dislike this tactic, seeing it as improper and dangerous. At first, Ramón forbids Esperanza from picketing, but she eventually joins the line while carrying her baby.

The sheriff, by company orders, arrests the leading women of the strike. Esperanza is among those taken to jail. The women are loud and unruly in jail and make it so unendurable for the sheriff, he releases them. When Esperanza returns home, Ramón tells her the strike is hopeless, as the company will easily outlast the miners. She insists that the union is stronger than ever and asks Ramón why he can&#x27;t accept her as an equal in their marriage. Both angry, they sleep separately that night.

The next day the company evicts the Quintero family from their house. The union men and women arrive to protest the eviction. Ramón tells Esperanza that they can all fight together. The mass of workers and their families prove successful in saving the Quinteros&#x27; home. The company admits defeat and plans to negotiate. Esperanza believes that the community has won something no company can ever take away and it will be inherited by her children.

==Production==

Herbert Biberman was one of the ten Hollywood screenwriters and directors who refused in 1947 to answer questions from the House Committee on Un-American Activities about their affiliations with the Communist Party USA. The &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot; were cited for contempt of Congress and jailed. Biberman was imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution at Texarkana for six months. After his release, and unable to obtain work in Hollywood, he met with fellow blacklistees about establishing their own production company and collaborating to make movies. In 1951, they formed the Independent Productions Corporation (IPC). &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was the sole production that IPC was able to finish. Other blacklistees who participated in the movie included Paul Jarrico, Will Geer, and Michael Wilson.

Before production commenced in Silver City, New Mexico, the mainstream press already labeled the film dangerous and subversive because it was known to be the creation of blacklisted professionals, and because the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (a.k.a. &quot;Mine Mill&quot;) was helping to fund it. The Mine Mill union had been expelled from the CIO in 1950 for its unwillingness to purge suspected Communists from its leadership. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; warned readers that &quot;H&#x27;wood Reds are shooting a feature length anti-American racial issue propaganda movie.&quot; &quot;Newsweek&quot; headlined its attack on the film, &quot;Reds in the Desert&quot;.

As Tom Miller notes in a &quot;Cinéaste&quot; article, the early negative publicity made it difficult to assemble a film crew: &quot;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees—IATSE, an AFL affiliate—refused to allow its members to work on &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; because of the movie&#x27;s politics. That the Hollywood unions wouldn&#x27;t let their members work on such a pro-union film was bitter irony.&quot; As a consequence, IPC had to scramble to put together a makeshift crew.
Only five professional actors were cast. The rest were residents of Grant County, New Mexico, or members of Mine Mill, Local 890, many of whom took part in the strike that inspired the movie. Juan Chacón was a real-life union local president. In the film he plays the protagonist who has trouble dealing with women as equals. The director was reluctant to cast him at first, thinking he was too &quot;gentle&quot;, but both Revueltas and the director&#x27;s sister-in-law, Sonja Dahl Biberman (wife of Biberman&#x27;s brother Edward), urged him to cast Chacón as Ramón.

According to one journalist&#x27;s account, &quot;During the course of production in New Mexico in 1953, the trade press denounced it as a subversive plot, anti-Communist vigilantes fired rifle shots at the set, the film&#x27;s leading lady Rosaura Revueltas was deported to Mexico, and from time to time a small airplane buzzed noisily overhead ... The film, edited in secret, was stored for safekeeping in an anonymous wooden shack in Los Angeles.&quot; After principal photography ended, laboratories wouldn&#x27;t process the film, which delayed postproduction work for months. As producer Paul Jarrico recalled in a 1983 interview, &quot;I had to trot around the country with cans of film under my arms, putting the film through different labs under phony names. We had a lot of trouble, but we did complete the film, despite the obstacles.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
With McCarthyism in full force at the time of release, the movie establishment did not embrace &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. Pauline Kael, who reviewed it for &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, panned it as a simplistic left-wing &quot;morality play&quot; and said it was &quot;as clear a piece of Communist propaganda as we have had in many years.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; praised several elements in the film but called it &quot;a propaganda picture which belongs in union halls rather than theatres.&quot;

Bosley Crowther, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewed the picture somewhat favorably, both for its direction and screenplay:

As anti-Communist fervor waned, the movie started to be judged on its merits. By 2021, the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics (based on thirteen reviews) had given the movie a positive rating.

===Suppression===
Although &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; received limited distribution in Western and Eastern Europe in the 1950s and won awards there, it was nearly impossible to see it in the United States. After its opening night in New York City, it languished for a decade because only thirteen theaters in the country were willing to show it. Roy Brewer of the IATSE leveraged his ties with the projectionists&#x27; union to cancel numerous bookings. The American Legion threatened to picket any theater that exhibited the movie. &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was denounced by the U.S. House of Representatives for its communist sympathies, and the FBI investigated the film&#x27;s financing, looking for evidence of foreign funds that could justify prosecution under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.

In 1959, officials from the United States Information Agency testified before a House Appropriations subcommittee that a handful of movies, including &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, &quot;were giving the United States trouble overseas.&quot; Representative Frank T. Bow (R-OH) said, &quot;such films were painting a false picture abroad of the United States and that something should be done about it.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t until 1965 that &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was re-released.

===Accolades===
* Grand Prix - Crystal Globe for Best Feature Film (shared with &quot;True Friends&quot;) at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia in 1954. At that same festival, Rosaura Revueltas won the Best Actress Award.
* International Grand Prize from the Academie du Cinema de Paris in 1955.
* In 1992, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;
* The film is preserved by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

==Later history==

The story of the suppression of &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, as well as the people and labor struggle it depicts, inspired an underground audience of unionists, feminists, Mexican-Americans, leftists, film historians, and labor scholars. The movie found a new life in the U.S. in the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s and reached larger audiences through union halls, college campuses, art houses, women&#x27;s associations, and film schools, even though it was projected with a relatively poor 16mm stock.

In subsequent decades, the film was shown on public television and released on videocassette. In 1997, Turner Classic Movies screened &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; which further raised its profile beyond the initial cult following. In the early 2000s, the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary prompted a number of commemorative events, including a national conference hosted by the College of Santa Fe in which &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was called &quot;one of the most important and controversial films in American cinema history.&quot; In an interview, political commentator Noam Chomsky praised the film&#x27;s portrayal of union activity: &quot;[T]he real work is being done by people who are not known, that&#x27;s always been true in every popular movement in history ... I don&#x27;t know how you get that across in a film. Actually, come to think of it, there are some films that have done it. I mean, I don&#x27;t see a lot of visual stuff ... but I thought &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; really did it. It was a long time ago, but at the time I thought that it was one of the really great movies—and of course it was killed, I think it was almost never shown.&quot;

The &quot;Salt of the Earth Labor College&quot; located in Tucson, Arizona is named after the film. The pro-labor institution (not a college &quot;per se&quot;) holds lectures and forums related to unionism and economic justice. The film is screened on a frequent basis.

===Other releases===

In 1987, a laserdisc version was released by the Voyager Company. On July 27, 1999, a digitally restored print of the film was released on DVD by Organa through Geneon (Pioneer), and packaged with the documentary &quot;The Hollywood Ten&quot;, which reported on the ten filmmakers who were blacklisted for refusing to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In 2004, a budget edition DVD was released by Alpha Video.

Because the film&#x27;s copyright was not renewed in 1982, &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; is now in the public domain.

===Adaptations===
The film was adapted into a two-act opera called &quot;Esperanza&quot; (Hope). The labor movement in Wisconsin along with University of Wisconsin–Madison opera professor Karlos Moser commissioned the production. The music was written by David Bishop and the libretto by Carlos Morton. The opera premiered in Madison, Wisconsin, on August 25, 2000, to positive reviews.

===Portrayals in media===
John Sayles&#x27; &quot;Return of the Secaucus 7&quot; (1980) includes a wry homage to &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;. When the reunited baby boomer characters are briefly jailed, they reminisce about their radical college days when they were locked up in a Secaucus, New Jersey jail and chanted &quot;We want the formula! We want the formula!&quot; to bewildered guards. The guards didn&#x27;t realize it was an allusion to a &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; scene in which the picketing Mexican-American women are arrested and thrown in jail. Esperanza has her infant child with her, and all the women chant &quot;We want the formula!&quot; to pressure the sheriff to either bring formula for the hungry baby or let them out of jail. He opts for the latter.

A documentary titled &quot;A Crime to Fit the Punishment&quot;, about the making of the film, was released in 1982 and directed by Barbara Moss and Stephen Mack. The title comes from a Paul Jarrico quote regarding the blacklistees who formed Independent Productions Corporation: &quot;I have said that &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; was our chance to really say something in film, because we had already been punished, we had already been blacklisted. I used the phrase, &#x27;We wanted to commit a crime to fit the punishment.&#x27;&quot; The documentary premiered on May 1, 1982 in Silver City, New Mexico, with many of the surviving &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; cast and crew members in attendance.

A film drama, also based on the making of &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, was chronicled in &quot;One of the Hollywood Ten&quot; (2000). It was produced and directed by Karl Francis, starred Jeff Goldblum and Greta Scacchi, and was released in European countries on September 29, 2000.

A fictionalized account of the movie&#x27;s production figured prominently in the Audible podcast series, &quot;The Big Lie&quot; (2022). Based on source material written by Paul Jarrico, the production features voice performances from Jon Hamm, Kate Mara, Ana de la Reguera, Bradley Whitford, John Slattery, Giancarlo Esposito, and David Strathairn, and was written by John Mankiewicz and Jamie Napoli.

<text>Scarface (also known as Scarface: The Shame of the Nation and The Shame of a Nation) is a 1932 American pre-Code gangster film directed by Howard Hawks and produced by Hawks and Howard Hughes. The screenplay, by Ben Hecht, is based loosely on the novel first published in 1930 by Armitage Trail, which was inspired by Al Capone. The film stars Paul Muni as Italian immigrant gangster Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Camonte who violently rises through the Chicago gangland, with a supporting cast that includes George Raft and Boris Karloff. Camonte&#x27;s rise to power dovetails with his relentless pursuit of his boss&#x27;s mistress while his own sister pursues his best hitman. In an overt tie to the life of Capone, a version of the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre is depicted.

After purchasing the rights to Trail&#x27;s novel, Hughes quickly selected Hawks to direct and Hecht to write the film&#x27;s screenplay. Beginning in January 1931, Hecht wrote the script over an eleven-day period. &quot;Scarface&quot; was produced before the introduction of the Production Code in 1934, which enforced regulations on film content. However, the Hays Code, a more lenient precursor, called for major alterations, including a prologue condemning gangsters, an alternate ending to more clearly reprehend Camonte, and the alternative title &quot;The Shame of a Nation&quot;. The censors believed the film glorified violence and crime. These changes delayed the film by a year, though some showings retained the original ending. Modern showings of the film have the original ending, though some DVD releases also include the alternate ending as a feature; these versions maintain the changes Hughes and Hawks were required to make for approval by the Hays Office. No completely unaltered version was known to exist until the limited-edition set of &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983) was released on October 15, 2019.

Audience reception was positive, but censors banned the film in several cities and states, forcing Hughes to remove it from circulation and store it in his vault. The rights to the film were recovered after Hughes&#x27;s death in the 1970s. Alongside &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (both 1931), &quot;Scarface&quot; is regarded as one of the most significant and influential gangster films.

&quot;Scarface&quot; was added to the National Film Registry in 1994 by the Library of Congress. In 2008, the American Film Institute listed &quot;Scarface&quot; as the sixth-best gangster film. It was remade as the 1983 film of the same title starring Al Pacino.

==Plot==

In 1920s Chicago, an Italian immigrant and ambitious low-level thug Tony &quot;Scarface&quot; Camonte works as a bodyguard for crime lord &quot;Big&quot; Louis Costillo. Siding with Costillo&#x27;s disgruntled lieutenant Johnny Lovo, Tony guns down his boss. Lovo takes over Costillo&#x27;s territory in the South Side and has Tony and his associates, the dim-witted Angelo and the handsome playboy Guino &quot;Little Boy&quot; Rinaldo, supervise a lucrative bootlegging operation selling illegal beer to all of the bars there and forcing out rivals.

Tony urges Lovo to start moving in on the North Side, where the bootlegging is controlled by the Irish gangster O&#x27;Hara; Lovo refuses, ordering Tony to leave the North Side alone. Tony ignores these orders and starts taking out O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s men while expanding his rackets to the North. Before long, Lovo is only the nominal boss while Tony becomes increasingly notorious and powerful, attracting the attention of both other gangsters and the police.

Meanwhile, Tony pursues Johnny&#x27;s girlfriend, Poppy. At first, she is dismissive of him but pays him more attention as his status rises, and he starts flaunting his wealth. She visits his &quot;gaudy&quot; apartment where he shows her his window-view of an electric billboard advertising Cook&#x27;s Tours, which features the slogan which inspires him: &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;.

Tony finally gets rid of O&#x27;Hara. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s successor, Tom Gaffney, declares war on the South Side and attempts to kill Tony with tommy guns—which an excited Tony quickly arms his own men with. The war results in Tony’s victory while Gaffney is forced to go into hiding. A group of prominent citizens, including the police chief, vow to bring Tony down for all the carnage and bloodshed he has inflicted on the city.

During a night out at the theatre, Tony learns that Gaffney and the remainder of his crew are at a nearby bowling alley. Leaving Angelo behind to watch the rest of the show and report back to him the outcome, Tony personally kills Gaffney. Lovo&#x27;s anger at Tony finally boils over when Tony openly flirts and dances with Poppy in front of him at a nightclub. Tony sees his beloved sister Francesca &quot;Cesca&quot; dancing with a stranger at the club; obsessively protective over her, he becomes enraged and hits her. Later that night, some hired gunmen try to assassinate Tony, but he kills them.

Suspecting Lovo&#x27;s involvement, Tony goes to his office after bribing the local barber to call him and pretend to be part of the hit crew. When Lovo hangs up after claiming that he must have gotten the wrong number, Tony forces him to confess to the hit and then has Guino kill him. Tony, now the undisputed kingpin of the city&#x27;s underworld, takes Poppy on an expensive vacation to Florida to escape the police and media attention, while Cesca secretly visits Guino at Tony&#x27;s office and seduces him. The two began an affair.

 Returning home, Tony learns from his mother, who has often warned him of his bad behavior, that Cesca has moved in with another man and rushes over to find her with Guino. He kills his friend in a jealous rage, and Cesca runs away in tears after revealing that they had just gotten married and were planning to surprise him. The police issue a warrant for Tony&#x27;s arrest; he barricades himself in his home while Angelo is killed trying to protect him in a shootout with the police.

Cesca slips inside, planning to kill her brother, but can&#x27;t bring herself to do it. Tony and Cesca arm themselves, and Tony shoots at the police from the window with a Thompson submachine gun, laughing maniacally as he guns them down. Moments later, however, Cesca is killed by a stray bullet. Calling Cesca&#x27;s name as the apartment fills with tear gas, Tony stumbles down the stairs just as the police break down his door. Tony pleads for his life but instead of putting on the offered handcuffs, tries to escape, resulting in him being shot. As Tony falls dead on the street, the electric billboard blazes &quot;The World Is Yours&quot; above him.

===Development===
Business tycoon Howard Hughes, then involved in film-making, wanted a box-office hit after the success of his 1931 film &quot;The Front Page&quot;. Gangster films were topical in the early 1930s in the age of Prohibition, and Hughes wanted to make a film based on the life of gangster Al Capone superior to all other films in the genre. He was advised against making the film, as the genre was crowded; &quot;Little Caesar&quot; starring Edward G. Robinson and &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; starring James Cagney were already box-office successes, and Warner Bros. claimed nothing new could be done with the gangster genre. Furthermore, industry censors such as the Hays Office were becoming concerned with the glamorization of crime in media.

Hughes bought the rights to Armitage Trail&#x27;s novel &quot;Scarface&quot;, inspired by the life of Capone. Trail wrote for a number of detective story magazines during the early 1920s, but died of a heart attack at the age of 28, shortly before the release of &quot;Scarface&quot;. Hughes hired Fred Pasley, a New York reporter and authority on Capone, as a writer. Hughes asked Ben Hecht, who had won the first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1929 for his silent crime film &quot;Underworld&quot;, to be head writer. Suspicious of Hughes as an employer, Hecht requested a daily salary of $1,000, to be paid every day at six o&#x27;clock. Hecht claimed he would only waste a day&#x27;s labor if Hughes turned out to be a fraud.

Hughes wanted film director Howard Hawks to direct and co-produce. This surprised Hawks, as the two had never been friendly; Hughes had filed a lawsuit against Howard Hawks in July 1930, alleging that Hawks&#x27;s film &quot;The Dawn Patrol&quot; had plagiarized his film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Over a game of golf, Hughes promised to drop the lawsuit (irrelevant as it had already been dismissed by the judge), and by the eighteenth hole, Hawks had become interested in directing the film. He became more convinced when he discovered Hecht would be the head writer. Hecht and Hawks worked well together, intending to portray the Capone character as of the Borgia Family, including the suggestion of incest between the main character and his sister, present in Trail&#x27;s novel.

===Writing===
Hecht wrote the screenplay over eleven days in January 1931, adapted from Trail&#x27;s novel. Additional writing was provided by Fred Pasley and W.R. Burnett, author of the novel &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, upon which the film &quot;Little Caesar&quot; was based. Pasley&#x27;s contributions included elements of the book &quot;Al Capone: Biography of a Self-Made Man;&quot; the book contains a barbershop scene with Capone similar to the introduction of Tony Camonte in the film. Pasley was not credited for his work on the screenplay. John Lee Mahin and Seton I. Miller rewrote the script for continuity and dialogue.

Because there were five writers, it is difficult to distinguish which components were contributed by which writer; however, the ending of &quot;Scarface&quot; is similar to Hecht&#x27;s first gangster film &quot;Underworld,&quot; in which gangster Bull Weed traps himself in his apartment with his lover and fires at the hordes of police outside, and thus was likely a Hecht contribution.

The film version of &quot;Scarface&quot; bears little resemblance to the novel. Though the film contains the same major characters, plot points, and incestual undertones, changes were made to reduce the length and the number of characters, and to satisfy the requests of censorship offices. To make gangsters appear less admirable, Tony&#x27;s character was made to appear less intelligent and more brutish than in the novel. Similarly, the sibling relationship between Tony and the police officer was removed to avoid depicting police corruption.

====Ties to Capone====
Both the film and novel are loosely based upon the life of gangster Al Capone, whose nickname was &quot;Scarface&quot;. The names of characters and locations were changed only minimally. Capone became Camonte, Torrio became Lovo, and Moran became Doran. In some early scripts, Colosimo was Colisimo and O&#x27;Bannion was Bannon, but the names were changed to Costillo and O&#x27;Hara, respectively. This, including other alterations made to characters and other identifying locations to maintain anonymity, were due to censorship and Hawks&#x27;s concern about the overuse of historical details.

Ben Hecht had met Capone and &quot;knew a lot about Chicago&quot;, so he did no research for the script. According to Hecht, while he worked on the script, Capone sent two men to visit him in Hollywood to make sure the film was not based on Capone&#x27;s life. He told them the Scarface character was a parody of numerous people, and that the title was chosen as it was intriguing. The two left Hecht alone.

The references to Capone and actual events from the Chicago gang wars were obvious to audiences at the time. Muni&#x27;s character had a scar similar to Capone&#x27;s, received in similar fights. The police in the film mention Camonte is a member of the Five Points Gang in Brooklyn, of which Capone was a known member. Tony kills his boss &quot;Big Louis&quot; Costillo in the lobby of his club; Capone was involved in the murder of his first boss &quot;Big Jim&quot; Colosimo in 1920. Rival boss O&#x27;Hara is murdered in his flower shop; Capone&#x27;s men murdered Dean O&#x27;Bannion in his flower shop in 1924. The assassination of seven men in a garage, with two of the gunmen costumed as police officers, mirrors the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre of 1929. The leader of this rival gang narrowly escapes the shooting, as did gang leader Bugs Moran. The film opens at the intersection of 22nd Street and Wabash Avenue in the middle of Capone&#x27;s South Side, the site of many Capone&#x27;s crimes.

Despite the clear references to Capone, Capone was rumored to have liked the film so much he owned a print of it. However, this was likely an exaggerated claim by Hawks as Capone was imprisoned in Atlanta for tax evasion during the film&#x27;s release.

===Casting===

Hawks and Hughes found casting difficult as most actors were under contract and studios were reluctant to allow their artists to freelance for independent producers. Producer Irving Thalberg suggested Clark Gable, but Hawks believed Gable was a personality, not an actor. After seeing Paul Muni on Broadway, talent agent Al Rosen suggested him for the lead role. Muni initially declined, feeling he was not physically suited for the role, but after reading the script, his wife, Bella, convinced him to take it. After a test run in New York, Hughes, Hawks, and Hecht approved Muni for the role.

Boris Karloff was cast as Irish gangster Gaffney, listed on a theatrical release poster as &quot;Boris &#x27;Frankenstein&#x27; Karloff&quot;. Jack La Rue was cast as Tony Camonte&#x27;s sidekick Guino Rinaldo (modeled after Al Capone&#x27;s bodyguard Frank Rio) but as he was taller than Muni, Hawks worried he would overshadow Muni&#x27;s tough Scarface persona. He was replaced with George Raft, a struggling actor at the time, after Hawks encountered him at a prizefight. Raft had played an almost identical part the previous year as his feature film debut in &quot;Quick Millions&quot;, a gangster film starring Spencer Tracy, but the &quot;Scarface&quot; role would catapult Raft to stardom.

Though Karen Morley was under contract at MGM, Hawks was close with MGM studio executive Eddie Mannix, who loaned out Morley for the film. She was reportedly given the choice between the role of Poppy or Cesca. Though Cesca was the stronger role, she chose Poppy as she felt Cesca would be a better fit for her friend Ann Dvorak. She considered this &quot;probably the nicest thing [she] did in [her] life&quot;. Morley invited 20-year-old Dvorak to a party at Hawks&#x27; house to introduce them. According to Hawks, at the party, Dvorak zeroed in on George Raft who played her love interest. He initially declined her invitation to dance. She tried to dance in front of him in order to lure him; eventually, he gave in, and their dance together stopped the party. After this event, Hawks was interested in casting her but had reservations about her lack of experience. After a screen test, he gave her the part, and MGM was willing to release her from her contract as a chorus girl. Dvorak had to both receive permission from her mother Anna Lehr and to win a petition presented to the Superior Court to be able to sign on with Howard Hawks as a minor.

===Filming===
Filming lasted six months, which was long for films made in the early 1930s. Howard Hughes remained off-set to avoid interfering with the filming of the movie. Hughes urged Hawks to make the film as visually exciting as possible by adding car chases, crashes, and machine-gun fire. Hawks shot the film at three different locations: Metropolitan Studios, Harold Lloyd Studios, and the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. Filming took three months with the cast and crew working seven days a week. For the most violent scene of the film in the restaurant, Hawks cleared the set to avoid harming extras and had the set fired on by machine guns. The actors acted out the scene in front of a screen with the shooting projected in the back, so as everyone crowded under the tables in the restaurant, the room appeared to be simultaneously under fire.

During filming, Hawks and Hughes met with the Hays Office to discuss revisions. Despite that, &quot;Scarface&quot; was filmed and put together quickly. In September 1931, a rough cut of the film was screened for the California Crime Commission and police officials, neither of whom thought the movie was a dangerous influence for audiences or would elicit a criminal response. Irving Thalberg was given an advanced screening and was impressed by the film. Despite the positive feedback the film was given, the Hays Office was insistent on changes before final approval.

===Censorship===
&quot;Scarface&quot; was produced and filmed during the pre-Code era of Hollywood, which spanned from 1930 to 1934. The pre-Code era is characterized by its informal and haphazard screening and regulation of film content, before the establishment of the Production Code Administration (PCA) on July 1, 1934. Before the influence of the PCA, censorship was overseen by the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA). In 1930, Will Hays, the chairman of the MPPDA, attempted to regulate the content of movies; the MPPDA became known as the Hays Office. The goal of the Hays Office was to censor nudity, sexuality, drug use, and crime. More specific to &quot;Scarface&quot;, the Hays Office wanted to avoid the sympathetic portrayal of crime by either showing criminals recognizing the error of their ways or showing criminals getting punished. The Hays Office, however, did not have authority to remove material from a film until the MPPDA officially pledged to adhere to the Production Code in 1934, so they relied on delaying film release and lobbying to remove scenes or prevent movies from being produced. Films evaded the Hays Office by adding extremely suggestive scenes so they could remove them and satisfy the Hays Office enough that they would not notice the lesser immoralities that remained in the film.

J. E. Smyth described &quot;Scarface&quot; as &quot;one of the most highly censored films in Hollywood history&quot;. Howard Hawks believed the Hays Office had personal vendettas against the movie, while Hughes believed the censorship was due to &quot;ulterior and political motives&quot; of corrupt politicians. However, James Wingate of the New York censor boards rebutted that Hughes was preoccupied with &quot;box-office publicity&quot; in producing the film. After repeated demands for a script rewrite from the Hays Office, Hughes ordered Hawks to shoot the film: &quot;Screw the Hays Office, make it as realistic, and grisly as possible.&quot; The Hays Office was outraged by &quot;Scarface&quot; when they screened it. According to the Hays Office, &quot;Scarface&quot; violated the Code, because the film elicited sympathy for Muni&#x27;s character, and it revealed to youth a successful method of crime. The Hays Office called for scenes to be deleted, scenes to be added to condemn gangsterism, and a different ending. They believed Tony&#x27;s death at the end of the film was too glorifying. In addition to the violence, the MPPDA felt an inappropriate relationship between the main character and his sister was too overt, especially when he holds her in his arms after he slaps her and tears her dress; they ordered this scene be deleted. Hughes, in order to receive the MPPDA&#x27;s approval, deleted the more violent scenes, added a prologue to condemn gangsterism, and wrote a new ending.

In addition, a couple of scenes were added to overtly condemn gangsterism, such as a scene in which a newspaper publisher looks at the screen and directly admonishes the government and the public for their lack of action in fighting against mob violence and a scene in which the chief detective denounces the glorification of gangsters. Hawks refused to shoot the extra scenes and the alternate ending. They were directed by Richard Rosson, earning Rosson the title of &quot;co-director&quot;. Hughes was instructed to change the title to &quot;The Menace&quot;, &quot;Shame of the Nation&quot; or &quot;Yellow&quot; to clarify the subject of the film; after months of haggling, he compromised with the title &quot;Scarface: The Shame of the Nation&quot; and by adding a foreword condemning &quot;gangsters&quot; in a general sense. Hughes made an attempt to release the film under the title &quot;The Scar&quot; when the original title was disallowed by the Hays office. Besides the title, the term &quot;Scarface&quot; was removed from the film. In the scene where Tony kills Rinaldo, Cesca says the word &quot;murderer&quot;, but she can be seen mouthing the word &quot;Scarface&quot;.

The original script had Tony&#x27;s mother loving her son unconditionally, praising his lifestyle, and even accepting money and gifts from him. In addition, there was a politician who, despite campaigning against gangsters on the podium, is shown partying with them after hours. The script ends with Tony staying in the building, unaffected by tear gas and a multitude of bullets fired at him. After the building is set on fire, Tony is forced to exit, guns blazing. He is sprayed with police gunfire but appears unfazed. Upon noticing the police officer who had been arresting him throughout the film, he fires at him, only to hear a single &quot;click&quot; noise implying his gun is empty. He is killed after the police officer shoots him several times. A repeated clicking noise is heard on the soundtrack implying he was attempting to fire while he was dying.

===Alternate ending===
The first version of the film (Version A) was completed on September 8, 1931, but censors required the ending be modified or they would refuse to grant &quot;Scarface&quot; a license. Paul Muni was unable to re-film the ending in 1931 due to his work on Broadway. Consequently, Hawks was forced to use a body double. The body double was mainly filmed by way of shadows and long shots in order to mask Muni&#x27;s absence in these scenes. The alternate ending (Version B) differs from the original ending in the manner that Tony is caught and in which he dies. Unlike the original ending, where Tony tries to escape from the police and dies after being shot several times, in the alternate ending, Tony reluctantly hands himself over to the police. After the encounter, Tony&#x27;s face is not shown. A scene follows where a judge is addressing Tony during sentencing. The next scene is the finale, in which Tony (seen from a bird&#x27;s eye view) is brought to the gallows and hanged.

However, Version B did not pass the New York and Chicago censors. Howard Hughes felt the Hays Office had suspicious intentions in rejecting the film because Hays was friends with Louis B. Mayer, and Hughes believed censorship was to prevent wealthy, independent competitors from producing films. Confident his film could stand out among audiences more than Mayer&#x27;s films, Hughes organized a press showing of the film in Hollywood and New York. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; praised Hughes for his courage in opposing the censors. Hughes disowned the censored film and finally, in 1932, released Version A with the added text introduction in states that lacked strict censors (Hughes attempted to take the New York censors to court). This 1932 release version led to bonafide box-office status and positive critical reviews. Hughes was successful in subsequent lawsuits against the boards that censored the film. Due to criticism from the press, Hays claimed the version shown in theaters was the censored film he had previously approved.

===Music===
Due to the film&#x27;s urban setting, nondiegetic music (not visible on the screen or implied to be present in the story) was not used in the film. The only music that appears in the film is during the opening and closing credits and during scenes in the movie where music appears naturally in the film&#x27;s action such as in the nightclub. Adolf Tandler served as the film&#x27;s musical director, while Gus Arnheim served as the orchestra&#x27;s conductor. Gus Arnheim and his Cocoanut Grove Orchestra perform &quot;Saint Louis Blues&quot; by W.C. Handy and &quot;Some of These Days&quot; by Shelton Brooks in the nightclub. The tune Tony whistles in the film is the sextet from Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. This tune is accompanied by words that translate to, &quot;What restrains me in such a moment?&quot;, and this tune continues to appear during violent scenes in the movie. The song Cesca sings while playing the piano is &quot;Wreck of the Old 97&quot;.

===Cultural references===
The serious play Tony and his friends go to see, leaving at the end of Act 2, is John Colton and Clemence Randolph&#x27;s &quot;Rain&quot;, based on W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s story &quot;Miss Sadie Thompson&quot;. The play opened on Broadway in 1922 and ran throughout the 1920s. (A film version of the play, also titled &quot;Rain&quot; and starring Joan Crawford, was released by United Artists the same year as &quot;Scarface&quot;.) Though fairly inconspicuous in the film, and unnoticed by most viewers, the Camonte family was meant to be partially modeled after the Italo-Spanish Borgia family. This was most prominent through the subtle and arguably incestuous relationship Tony Camonte and his sister share. Camonte&#x27;s excessive jealousy of his sister&#x27;s affairs with other men hint at this relationship. Coincidentally, Donizetti wrote the opera for &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;, about the Borgia family, and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; from where Tony Camonte&#x27;s whistle tune comes.
==Release==
After battling with censorship offices, the film was released around a year later than &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; and &quot;Little Caesar&quot;. &quot;Scarface&quot; was released in theaters on April 9, 1932. Hughes planned a grand premiere in New York, but New York censor boards rejected the showing of the film. State censorship boards in Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, and Kansas and citywide censorship boards in Detroit, Seattle, Portland, and Chicago banned the film as well. Hughes threatened to sue censorship boards for preventing the release of his film much to the approval of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. Each state had a different board of censors which allowed Hughes to release the film in areas without strict censorship. At the request of Will Hays, Jason Joy convinced the strict censor boards to allow the release of &quot;Scarface&quot;, because the Hays Office acknowledged and appreciated the changes Hughes made to the film. Joy visited state censor boards individually, stating that while the Hays Office was against the positive portrayal of crime, gang films were actually documents against gangster life. Joy was successful and eventually all state and municipal censorship boards allowed &quot;Scarface&quot; to be released, accepting only the cut and censored version of &quot;Scarface&quot;.

==Reception==
At the time of release, audiences were generally positive. According to George Raft, who met Al Capone a few times at casinos, even Capone himself liked the film adding, &quot;you tell &#x27;em that if any of my boys are tossin&#x27; coins, they&#x27;ll be twenty-dollar gold pieces.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; cited &quot;Scarface&quot; as having &quot;that powerful and gripping suspense which is in all gangster pictures is in this one in double doses and makes it compelling entertainment&quot;, and that the actors play, &quot;as if they&#x27;d been doing nothing else all their lives&quot;. The National Board of Review named &quot;Scarface&quot; as one of the best pictures of 1932. However, at the time of release in 1932, there was a general public outcry about this motion picture and the gangster genre in general, which negatively affected the film&#x27;s box-office receipts. Jack Alicoate gave &quot;Scarface&quot; a scathing review in &quot;The Film Daily&quot;, stating that the violence and subject matter of the film left him with, &quot;the distinct feeling of nausea&quot;. He goes on to say the film &quot;should never have been made&quot; and showing the film would &quot;do more harm to the motion picture industry, and everyone connected with it, than any picture ever shown&quot;. Although Ben Hecht was often critical of his work for Hollywood, he admitted that &quot;Scarface&quot; was &quot;the best-directed picture [he has] seen&quot;. Hecht did, however, criticize Muni&#x27;s performance. Having known Al Capone, Hecht claimed that Muni portrayed Capone as too &quot;silent&quot; and &quot;moody&quot;, more similar to &quot;Hitler&quot;. Some critics disagreed with the casting of British actor Boris Karloff, believing his accent was out of place in a gangster film; a &quot;New York Times&quot; article stated &quot;his British accent is hardly suitable to the role&quot;. However, other critics considered him a high point. The film earned $600,000 at the box office, and while &quot;Scarface&quot; was more financially successful than Hughes&#x27;s other films at the time, due to the large cost of production, it is unlikely the film did better than break even.

The film initiated outrage among Italian organizations and individuals of Italian descent, remarking a tendency of filmmakers to portray gangsters and bootleggers in their films as Italian. In the film, an Italian American makes a speech condemning gangster activities; this was added later in production to appease censors. This, however, did not prevent the Italian embassy from disapproving &quot;Scarface&quot;. Believing the film to be offensive to the Italian community, the Order Sons of Italy in America formally denounced the film and other groups urged community members to boycott the film and other films derogatory towards Italians or Italian-Americans. Will Hays wrote to the ambassador in Italy, excusing himself from scrutiny by stating the film was an anachronism because it had been delayed in production for two years and was not representative of the current practice of censorship at the time. Nazi Germany permanently prohibited showings of the film. Some cities in England banned the film as well, believing the British Board of Film Censorship&#x27;s policy on gangster films was too lax. The film had been banned in Ireland on August 19, 1932, and on August 29, 1941, (under the alternate title of &#x27;Gang War&#x27;). The decisions were upheld by the Films Appeal Board each time. It was banned on April 24, 1953, (under its original title). No appeal was lodged. Various reasons include pandering to sensationalism, glamorizing the gangster lifestyle and implying an incestuous relationship between the protagonist and his sister.

Several cities in the United States, including Chicago, and some states refused to show the film. The magazine &quot;Movie Classics&quot; ran an issue urging the people to demand to see the film at theaters despite the censorship bans. The film broke box-office records at the Woods Theatre in Chicago after premiering Thanksgiving Day, November 20, 1941, after having been banned from showing in Chicago by censors for nine years. Despite the favorable reception of the film among the public, the censorship battles and the unflattering reviews from some press contributed to the film&#x27;s generally poor performance at the box-office. Upset at the inability to make money from &quot;Scarface&quot;, Howard Hughes removed the film from circulation. The film remained unavailable until 1979 except for occasional release prints of suspect quality from questionable sources. Hughes had plans in 1933 to direct and produce a sequel to &quot;Scarface&quot;, but due to stricter censorship rules, the film was never made.

Based on a sampling of 46 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Scarface&quot; holds a 98% rating, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;This &quot;Scarface&quot; foregoes his &quot;little friend&quot; and packs a different kind of heat, blending stylish visuals, thrilling violence, and an incredible cast.&quot; It holds a rating of 90 on Metacritic based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Industry reception===
In 1994, &quot;Scarface&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The character of Tony Camonte ranked at number 47 on &quot;AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains&quot; list. The film was named the best American sound film by critic and director Jean-Luc Godard in &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;. In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot;—the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Scarface&quot; was acknowledged as the sixth best in the gangster film genre. The 1983 version was placed 10th, making &quot;Scarface&quot; the only film to make the same &quot;10 Top 10&quot; list as its remake.

==Analysis==

Scholars debate whether &quot;Scarface&quot; classifies as a film with historical significance or as merely a Hollywood gangster-era motion picture. Its historical significance was augmented by the film&#x27;s writing credits: W. R. Burnett, author of gangster novel &quot;Little Caesar&quot; from which the film of the same name was based on; Fred D. Pasley, a prominent Chicago gangland historian; and Ben Hecht, an ex-Chicago reporter. Events similar to the assassination of Jim Colismo and the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre contribute to the film&#x27;s realism and authenticity. Film critic Robert E. Sherwood stated that the film &quot;merits...as a sociological or historical document&quot;, and &quot;an utterly inexcusable attempt has been made to suppress it—not because it is obscene...but because...it comes too close to telling the truth.&quot;

===Excess===
According to film studies professor Fran Mason, a prominent theme in the film is excess. The opening of the film sets the stage as Big Louie Costillo sits in the remnants of a wild party, convincing his friends his next party will be bigger, better, and have &quot;much more everything&quot;. This indicates the excessive life of a gangster, whether in pleasure or in violence. The death scene of Costillo sets the next tone of excess. In this scene, the audience sees only the shadow of Tony Camonte with a gun, hears the shots and the sound of the body hitting the floor. The violent scenes become more severe as the film progresses. Most of the violence in the film is shown through montage, as scenes go by in sequence, showing the brutal murders that Tony and his gang commit such as roughing up bar owners, participating in a drive-by bombing, and massacring seven men against a wall. A scene shows a peel-off calendar rapidly changing dates while shot by a machine gun, making the excessive violence clear. The violence is not only perpetrated by the gangsters. The police in the final scene with Tony and Cesca spare no effort to catch the notorious Camonte siblings, visible through the disproportionate number of police officers and cars surrounding the apartment complex to apprehend one man. Tony and the police&#x27;s excessive use of violence throughout the film normalizes it. An element of parody underlies Tony&#x27;s abnormal joy in using Tommy guns. In the scene in the restaurant in which men from the North Side gang attempt to shoot Tony with a Tommy, he obtains pleasure from the power. Rather than cowering beneath the tables, he tries to peek out to watch the guns in action, laughing maniacally from his excitement. He reacts jovially upon getting his first Tommy gun and enthusiastically leaves to &quot;write [his] name all over the town with it in big letters&quot;.

The gangster&#x27;s excessive consumption is comically represented through Tony&#x27;s quest to obtain expensive goods and show them off. In Tony&#x27;s first encounter with Poppy alone on the staircase, he boasts about his new suit, jewelry, and bulletproof car. Poppy largely dismisses his advances calling his look &quot;kinda effeminate&quot;. His feminine consumption and obsession with looks and clothes is juxtaposed by his masculine consumption, which is represented by his new car. Later, Tony shows Poppy a stack of new shirts, claiming he will wear each shirt only once. His awkwardness and ignorance of his own exorbitance make this Gatsby-style scene more comical than serious. His consumption serves to symbolize the disintegration of values of modernity, specifically represented by his poor taste and obsession with money and social status. Tony&#x27;s excess transcends parody and becomes dangerous because he represents a complete lack of restraint that ultimately leads to his downfall.

Tony&#x27;s excess is manifested in the gang wars in the city. He is given express instruction to leave O&#x27;Hara, Gaffney, and the rest of the North Side gang alone. He disobeys because of his lust for more power, violence, and territory. Not only does he threaten the external power structure of the gangs in relation to physical territory, but he also disrupts the internal power structure of his own gang by blatantly disobeying his boss, Johnny Lovo. Gaffney&#x27;s physical position juxtaposes Tony&#x27;s position. Throughout the film, Gaffney&#x27;s movement is restricted by both setting and implication because of the crowded spaces in which he is shown onscreen and his troupe of henchmen by whom he is constantly surrounded. Tony is able to move freely at the beginning of the film, becoming progressively more crowded until he is as confined as Gaffney. He is surrounded by henchmen and cannot move as freely throughout the city. This, however, is self-imposed by his own excessive desire for territory and power.

The theme of excessiveness is further exemplified by Tony&#x27;s incestuous desires for his sister, Cesca, whom he attempts to control and restrict. Their mother acts as the voice of reason, but Tony does not listen to her, subjecting his family to the excess and violence he brings upon himself. His lust for violence mirror&#x27;s Cesca&#x27;s lust for sexual freedom, symbolized by her seductive dance for Rinaldo at the club. Rinaldo is split between his loyalty for Tony and his passion for Cesca, serving as a symbol of the power struggle between the Camonte siblings. Rinaldo is a symbol of Tony&#x27;s power and prominence; his murder signifies Tony&#x27;s lack of control and downfall, which ends in Tony&#x27;s own death.

===American Dream===

Camonte&#x27;s rise to prominence and success is modeled after the American Dream, but more overtly violent. As the film follows the rise and fall of an Italian gangster, Tony becomes increasingly more Americanized. When Tony appears from under the towel at the barbershop, this is the first time the audience gets a look at his face. He appears foreign with a noticeable Italian accent, slicked hair, and an almost Neanderthal appearance evident by the scars on his cheek. As the movie progresses, he becomes more Americanized as he loses his accent and his suits change from gaudy to elegant. By the end of the film, his accent is hardly noticeable. Upon the time of his death, he had accumulated many &quot;objects&quot; that portray the success suggested by the American Dream: his own secretary, a girlfriend of significant social status (more important even is that she was the mistress of his old boss), as well as a fancy apartment, big cars, and nice clothes. Camonte exemplifies the idea that one can obtain success in America by following Camonte&#x27;s own motto to &quot;Do it first, do it yourself, and keep on doin&#x27; it.&quot; On the other hand, Camonte represents the American urge to reject modern life and society, in turn rejecting Americanism itself. The gangster strives for the same American Dream as anyone else, but approaches it in a way at odds with modern societal values, through violence and illicit activity.

===Gangster territory===
Control of territory is a theme in the gangster film genre in a physical sense and on the movie screen. Tony works to control the city by getting rid of competing gangs and gaining physical control of the city, and he likewise gains control of the movie screen in his rise to power. This is most evident in scenes and interactions involving Tony, Johnny, and Poppy. In an early scene in the film, Tony comes to Johnny&#x27;s apartment to receive his payment after killing Louie Costillo. Two rooms are visible in the shot: the main room, where Tony sits, and the room in the background where Poppy sits and where Johnny keeps his money. Lovo goes into the back room but Tony does not, so this room represents Johnny&#x27;s power and territory. The men are sitting across from each other in the scene with Poppy sitting in the middle of them in the background representing the trophy they are both fighting for. However, they both appear equally in the shot, representing their equality of power. Later, in the nightclub scene, Tony sits himself in between Poppy and Johnny showing he is in control through his centrality in the shot. He has gained the most power and territory, as indicated by &quot;winning&quot; Poppy.

===Fear of technology===
&quot;Scarface&quot; represents the American fears and confusion that stemmed from the technological advancement of the time: whether technological advancement and mass production should be feared or celebrated. An overall anxiety post-World War I was whether new technology would cause ultimate destruction, or whether it would help make lives easier and bring happiness. In the film, Tony excitedly revels in the possibilities machine guns can bring by killing more people, more quickly, and from further away. This represents the question of whether or not mass production equals mass destruction or mass efficiency.

===Objects and gestures===
The use of playful motifs throughout the film showcased Howard Hawks&#x27;s dark comedy he expressed through his directing. In the bowling alley scene, where rival gang leader Tom Gaffney was murdered, when Gaffney throws the ball, the shot remains on the last standing bowling pin, which falls to represent the death of kingpin Tom Gaffney. In the same scene, before the death of Gaffney, a shot shows an &quot;X&quot; on the scoreboard, foreshadowing Gaffney&#x27;s death. Hawks used the &quot;X&quot; foreshadowing technique throughout the film (seen first in the opening credits) which were chiefly associated with death appearing many times (but not every scene) when a death is portrayed; the motif appears in numerous places, most prominently as Tony&#x27;s &quot;X&quot; scar on his left cheek. The motifs mock the life of the gangster. The gangster&#x27;s hat is a common theme throughout gangster films, specifically &quot;Scarface&quot;, as representative of conspicuous consumption. Hawks included hand gestures, a common motif in his films. In &quot;Scarface&quot;, George Raft was instructed to repetitively flip a coin, which he does throughout the film.

===&quot;The World Is Yours&quot;===
Camonte&#x27;s apartment looks out on a neon, flashing sign that says &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;. This sign represents the modern American city as a place of opportunity and individualism. As attractive as the slogan is, the message is impossible, yet Tony does not understand this. The view from his apartment represents the rise of the gangster. When Camonte is killed in the street outside his building, the camera pans up to show the billboard, representative of the societal paradox of the existence of opportunity yet the inability to achieve it. According to Robert Warshow, the ending scene represents how the world is not ours, but not his either. The death of the gangster momentarily releases us from the idea of the concept of success and the need to succeed. In regards to the theme of excess, the sign is a metaphor for the dividing desires created by modernity seen through the lens of the excessive desires of the gangster persona.

===Style===
&quot;Sharp&quot; and &quot;hard-edged&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot; set the visual style for the gangster films of the 1930s. Hawks created a violent, gripping film through his use of strong contrast of black and white in his cinematography. For example, dark rooms, silhouettes of bodies against drawn shades, and pools of carefully placed light. Much of the film is shown to take place at night. The tight grouping of subjects within the shot and stalking camera movement followed the course of action in the film. The cinematography is dynamic and characterized by highly varied camera placement and mobile framing.

===Italian-language versions===
In October 1946, after World War II and the relations between Italy and the United States softened, Titanus, an Italian film production company was interested in translating &quot;Scarface&quot; into Italian. Initially, upon requesting approval from the Italian film office, the request was rejected due to censorship concerns of the portrayal of violence and crime throughout the film. There was no initial concern about the film&#x27;s portrayal of Italians. Titanus appealed to the Italian film office calling &quot;Scarface&quot;, &quot;one of the most solid and constructive motion pictures ever produced overseas&quot;. They lobbied to bring in a foreign language film to help domestic film producers save money in the Italian economy damaged by the recent war. After receiving approval at the end of 1946, Titanus translated a script for dubbing the film. One difference in the Italian script is the names of the characters were changed from Italian sounding to more American sounding. For example, Tony Camonte was changed to Tony Kermont, and Guino Rinaldo was changed to Guido Reynold. This and several other changes were made to conspicuously remove references to Italians. Another example is the difference in the scene in the restaurant with Tony and Johnny. In the American version, Tony makes a comical statement about the garlic in the pasta, whereas, in the Italian translation, the food in question is a duck liver pâté, a less overtly Italian reference to food. Moreover, in the American version, the gangsters are referred to as illegal immigrants by the outraged community; however, in the Italian dubbed version, the citizen status of the criminals are not mentioned, merely the concern of repeat offenders.

The film was redubbed into Italian in 1976 by the broadcasting company &quot;Radio Televisione Italiana&quot; (RAI). Franco Dal Cer translated the script, and the dub was directed by Giulio Panicali. Pino Locchi dubbed the voice of Tony Camonte for Paul Muni and Pino Colizzi dubbed the voice of Gunio Rinaldo for George Raft. A difference between the 1947 version and the 1976 version is that all of the Italian names are and Italian cultural references were untouched from the original American script. The 1976 version celebrates the Italian backgrounds of the characters, adding noticeably different Italian dialects to specific characters. This version of the dubbed film translates the opening and closing credit scenes as well as the newspaper clippings shown into Italian; however, the translation of the newspaper clippings was not done with particular aesthetic care.

The film was redubbed in the 1990s and released on Universal&#x27;s digital edition. According to scholarly consensus, the 1990 dub is a combination of re-voicing and reuse of audio from the 1976 redub.

==Legacy==

Despite being unsuccessful at the box office, &quot;Scarface&quot; was one of the most discussed films of 1932 due to its subject matter and its struggle and triumph over censor boards. &quot;Scarface&quot; is cited (often with &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;) as the archetype of the gangster film genre, because it set the early standard for the genre which continues to appear in Hollywood. However, &quot;Scarface&quot; was the last of the three big gangsters films of the early 1930s, as the outrage at the pre-Code violence caused by the three films, particularly &quot;Scarface&quot;, sparked the creation of the Production Code Administration in 1934. Howard Hawks cited &quot;Scarface&quot; as one of his favorite works, and the film was a subject of pride for Howard Hughes. Hughes locked the film in his vaults a few years after release, refusing many profitable offers to distribute the film or to buy its rights. In 1979, three years after his death, Summa Corporation, which controlled his estate, sold the rights to &quot;Scarface&quot;, along with seven other films to Universal Pictures, which sparked the 1983 remake starring Al Pacino. Though rare for a remake, the 1983 version was also critically acclaimed.

Paul Muni&#x27;s performance in &quot;Scarface&quot; as &quot;the quintessential gangster anti-hero&quot; contributed greatly to his rapid ascent into his acclaimed film career. Paul Muni received significant accolades for his performance as Tony Camonte. Critics praised Muni for his robust and fierce performance. Al Pacino stated he was greatly inspired by Paul Muni, and Muni influenced his own performance in the 1983 &quot;Scarface&quot; remake. However, despite the impressive portrayal of a rising gangster, critics claim the character minimally resembled Al Capone. Unlike Camonte, Capone avoided grunt work and typically employed others to do his dirty work for him. Moreover, Muni&#x27;s Scarface at the end revealed the Capone character to be a coward as he pled for mercy and tried to escape before getting shot in the street. Capone was not known for his cowardice and did not die in battle.

&quot;Scarface&quot; was Ann Dvorak&#x27;s best known film. The film launched Raft&#x27;s lengthy career as a leading man. Raft, in the film&#x27;s second lead, had learned to flip a coin without looking at it, a trait of his character, and he made a strong impression in the comparatively sympathetic but colorful role. Howard Hawks told Raft to use this in the film to camouflage his lack of acting experience. A reference is made in Raft&#x27;s later role as gangster Spats Columbo in &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; (1959), wherein he asks a fellow gangster (who is flipping a coin) &quot;Where did you pick up cheap trick?&quot;

The movie &quot;Scarface&quot; may have had an influence on actual gangster life four years after the film was released. In 1936, Jack McGurn, who was thought to be responsible for the St. Valentine&#x27;s Massacre depicted in the film, was murdered by rivals in a bowling alley.

===Home media===
The film was one of the first films released on video by MCA Videocassette in May 1980. The film was released on DVD on May 22, 2007, and was released again on August 28, 2012, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Universal Studios, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. Both versions of the DVD include an introduction by &quot;Turner Classic Movies&quot; host and film historian Robert Osborne and the film&#x27;s alternate ending. On video and on television, the film maintains Hawks&#x27;s original ending but still contains the other alterations he was required to make during filming. A completely unaltered and uncensored version of the film was not known to exist until the limited-edition set of &quot;Scarface&quot; (1983) was released on October 15, 2019. In 2024, The Criterion Collection announced a 4K/Blu-ray release for November of that year.

===Related films===
After the rights for &quot;Scarface&quot; were obtained after the death of Howard Hughes, Brian de Palma released a remake of the film in 1983 featuring Al Pacino as Scarface. The film was set in contemporary 1980s Miami in the Hispanic underworld and is known for its inclusion of graphic violence and obscene language, considered &quot;as violent and obscene for the 1980s&quot; as the original film was considered for 1930s cinema. The 2003 DVD &quot;Anniversary Edition&quot; limited-edition box set of the 1983 film includes its 1932 counterpart. At the end of the 1983 film, a title reading &quot;This film is dedicated to Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht&quot; appears over the final shot.

Universal announced in 2011 that the studio is developing a new version of &quot;Scarface&quot;. The studio claims the new film is neither a sequel nor a remake, but will take elements from both the 1932 and the 1983 version, including the basic premise of a man who becomes a kingpin in his quest for the American Dream. In 2016, Antoine Fuqua was in talks to direct the remake, but left the project the following year in February, with the Coen brothers rewriting the script. Universal later hired David Ayer to direct and contracted Diego Luna to star, but dismissed Ayer because his script was too violent. In 2018, Fuqua was back on the project, but left again in May 2020. Instead, Luca Guadagnino has signed to direct the film, with the script from Coen brothers.

&quot;Scarface&quot; is often associated with other pre-code crime films released in the early 1930s such as &quot;The Doorway to Hell&quot; (1930), &quot;Little Caesar&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (1931). According to Fran Mason of the University of Winchester, &quot;Scarface&quot; is more similar to the film &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; than its early 1930s gangster film contemporaries because of its excess.

<text>The Searchers is a 1956 American epic Western film directed by John Ford and written by Frank S. Nugent, based on the 1954 novel by Alan Le May. It is set during the Texas–Indian wars, and stars John Wayne as a middle-aged Civil War veteran who spends years looking for his abducted niece (Natalie Wood), accompanied by his adopted nephew (Jeffrey Hunter). It was shot in VistaVision on Eastmancolor negative with processing and prints by Technicolor.

The film was a critical and commercial success. Since its release, it has come to be considered a masterpiece and one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. It was named the greatest American Western by the American Film Institute in 2008, and it placed 12th on the same organization&#x27;s 2007 list of the 100 greatest American movies of all time. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also named it the best Western. The British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine ranked it as the seventh-best film of all time based on a 2012 international survey of film critics and in 2008, the French magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; ranked &quot;The Searchers&quot; number 10 in their list of the 100 best films ever made.

In 1989, &quot;The Searchers&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress, and selected for preservation in its National Film Registry; it was one of the first 25 films selected for the registry.

&quot;The Searchers&quot; was the first major film to have a purpose-filmed making-of, requested by John Ford. It deals with most aspects of making the film, including preparation of the site, construction of props, and filming techniques.

== Plot ==
In 1868, Ethan Edwards returns after an eight-year absence to the home of his brother Aaron in West Texas. Ethan fought in the Civil War on the side of the Confederacy, and in the three years since that war ended, he also apparently fought in the Second Franco–Mexican War. He has a lot of gold coins of uncertain origin in his possession, and a medal from the Mexican campaign that he gives to his eight-year-old niece, Debbie. As a former Confederate soldier, when he is asked to take an oath of allegiance to the Texas Rangers, he refuses.

Shortly after Ethan&#x27;s arrival, cattle belonging to his neighbor Lars Jorgensen are stolen, and Rev. Captain Samuel Clayton leads Ethan and a group of Rangers to recover them. After discovering that the theft was a Comanche ploy to draw the men away from their families, they return and find the Edwards homestead in flames. Aaron, his wife Martha, and their son Ben are dead, while Debbie and her older sister Lucy have been abducted.

After a brief funeral, the men set out in pursuit. When they find the Comanche camp, Ethan recommends a frontal attack, but Clayton insists on a stealth approach to avoid killing the hostages. The camp turns out to be deserted, and further along the trail, the men ride into an ambush. Despite fending off the attack, the Rangers are left with too few men to fight the Comanche effectively. They return home, leaving Ethan to continue his search for the girls with only Lucy&#x27;s fiancé, Brad Jorgensen, and Debbie&#x27;s adopted brother, Martin Pawley. Ethan finds Lucy murdered (and, it is implied, raped) in a canyon near the Comanche camp. In a blind rage, Brad rides directly into the camp and is killed.

When winter arrives, Ethan and Martin lose the trail and return to the Jorgensen ranch. Martin is enthusiastically welcomed by the Jorgensens&#x27; daughter Laurie, and Ethan finds a letter waiting for him from a trader named Futterman, who claims to have information about Debbie. Ethan, who would rather travel alone, leaves without Martin the next morning, but Laurie reluctantly provides Martin with a horse to catch up. At Futterman&#x27;s trading post, Ethan and Martin learn that Debbie has been taken by Scar, the chief of the Nawyecka band of Comanches. A year or more later, Laurie receives a letter from Martin describing the ongoing search. Reading the letter aloud, Laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which Ethan kills Futterman for trying to steal his money, and Martin accidentally buys a Comanche wife who runs away when she hears Scar&#x27;s name; later, she is among the dead when the two men find a portion of Scar&#x27;s band killed by soldiers.

In New Mexico Territory, they find Debbie after five years, now an adolescent, living as one of Scar&#x27;s wives. She says that she has become a Comanche and wishes to remain with them. Ethan would rather see her dead than living as a Native American, and tries to shoot her, but Martin shields her with his body and a Comanche wounds Ethan with an arrow as they escape. Although Martin tends to Ethan&#x27;s wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill Debbie. Later, they return home.

Meanwhile, Charlie McCorry has been courting Laurie in Martin&#x27;s absence. Ethan and Martin arrive home just as Charlie and Laurie&#x27;s wedding is about to begin. After a fistfight between Martin and Charlie, a nervous Yankee soldier, Lieutenant Greenhill, brings news that Ethan&#x27;s friend Mose Harper has located Scar. Clayton leads his men to the Comanche camp, this time for a direct attack, but Martin is allowed to sneak in ahead of the assault to find Debbie, who welcomes him. Martin kills Scar to save Debbie. Ethan, finding Scar&#x27;s body, scalps him for revenge. Ethan then finds Debbie, and pursues her on horseback. Martin chases them desperately, fearing that Ethan will shoot her. Instead, Ethan sweeps her up into his arms and takes her to the Jorgensen ranch, where Martin reunites with Laurie. While everyone else enters the house, Ethan watches, then walks out.

== Production ==
&quot;The Searchers&quot; was the first production from &quot;distinguished &quot; C. V. Whitney; it was directed by John Ford and distributed by Warner Bros. While the film was primarily set in the staked plains (Llano Estacado) of northwestern Texas, it was actually filmed in Monument Valley, Arizona/Utah. Additional scenes were filmed in Mexican Hat, Utah, in Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park, Los Angeles, and in Elk Island National Park. The film was shot in the VistaVision widescreen process. Ford originally wanted to cast Fess Parker, whose performance as Davy Crockett on television had helped spark a national craze, for the Martin Pawley role, but Walt Disney, to whom Parker was under contract, refused to allow it and did not tell Parker about the offer, according to Parker&#x27;s videotaped interview for the Archive of American Television. Parker has said retrospectively that this was easily his worst career reversal.

As part of its promotion of &quot;The Searchers&quot; in 1956, Warner Bros. produced and broadcast one of the first behind-the-scenes, &quot;making-of&quot; programs in movie history, which aired as an episode of its &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; TV series.

&quot;The Searchers&quot; is the first of only three films produced by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney&#x27;s C. V. Whitney Pictures; the second was &quot;The Missouri Traveler&quot; in 1958 with Brandon deWilde and Lee Marvin, and the last was &quot;The Young Land&quot; in 1959 with Wayne&#x27;s son Patrick Wayne and Dennis Hopper.

== Historical background ==

Author Alan Le May&#x27;s surviving research notes indicate that the two characters who go in search of a missing girl were inspired by Britton Johnson, an African-American teamster who ransomed his captured wife and children from the Comanches in 1865. Afterward, Johnson made at least three trips to Indian Territory and Kansas, relentlessly searching for another kidnapped girl, Millie Durgan (or Durkin), until Kiowa raiders killed him in 1871.

Several film critics have suggested that &quot;The Searchers&quot; was inspired by the 1836 kidnapping of nine-year-old Cynthia Ann Parker by Comanche warriors, who raided her family&#x27;s home at Fort Parker, Texas. She spent 24 years with the Comanches, married a war chief, and had three children (one of whom was the famous Comanche Chief Quanah Parker), only to be rescued against her will by Texas Rangers. James W. Parker, Cynthia Ann&#x27;s uncle, spent much of his life and fortune in what became an obsessive search for his niece, much like Ethan Edwards in the film.

In addition, the rescue of Cynthia Ann, during a Texas Ranger attack known as the Battle of Pease River, resembles the rescue of Debbie Edwards when the Texas Rangers attack Scar&#x27;s village. Parker&#x27;s story was only one of 64 real-life cases of 19th-century child abductions in Texas that author Alan Le May studied while researching the novel on which the film was based.

The ending of Le May&#x27;s novel contrasts to the film&#x27;s, with Debbie running from the white men and the Native Americans. Marty, in one final leg of his search, finds her days later, only after she has fainted from exhaustion.

In the film, Scar&#x27;s Comanche group is referred to as the Nawyecka, correctly the &quot;Noyʉhka&quot; or &quot;Nokoni&quot;, the same band that kidnapped Cynthia Ann Parker. Some film critics have speculated that the historical model for the cavalry attack on a Comanche village, resulting in Look&#x27;s death and the taking of Comanche prisoners to a military post, was the well-known Battle of Washita River, November 27, 1868, when Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s 7th U.S. Cavalry attacked Black Kettle&#x27;s Cheyenne camp on the Washita River (near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma). The sequence also resembles the 1872 Battle of the North Fork of the Red River, in which the 4th Cavalry captured 124 Comanche women and children and imprisoned them at Fort Concho.

== Reception ==
=== Contemporaneous reviews ===
Upon the film&#x27;s release, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;ripsnorting Western&quot; (in spite of the &quot;excessive language in its ads&quot;); he credits Ford&#x27;s &quot;familiar corps of actors, writers, etc., [who help] to give the gusto to this film. From Frank S. Nugent, whose screenplay from the novel of Alan LeMay is a pungent thing, right on through the cast and technicians, it is the honest achievement of a well-knit team.&quot; Crowther noted &quot;two faults of minor moment&quot;:
* &quot;Episode is piled upon episode, climax upon climax, and corpse upon corpse... The justification for it is that it certainly conveys the lengthiness of the hunt, but it leaves one a mite exhausted, especially with the speed at which it goes.
* &quot;The director has permitted too many outdoor scenes to be set in the obviously synthetic surroundings of the studio stage... some of those campfire scenes could have been shot in a sporting-goods store window.&quot;
&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;handsomely mounted and in the tradition of &quot;Shane&quot;&quot;, yet &quot;somewhat disappointing&quot; due to its length and repetitiveness; &quot;The John Ford directorial stamp is unmistakable. It concentrates on the characters and establishes a definite mood. It&#x27;s not sufficient, however, to overcome many of the weaknesses of the story.&quot;

The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; termed the movie &quot;distinguished&quot;; &quot;Newsweek&quot; deemed it &quot;remarkable&quot;. &quot;Look&quot; described &quot;The Searchers&quot; as a &quot;Homeric odyssey&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Wayne&#x27;s performance as &quot;uncommonly commanding&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Though it does not consistently achieve the highest Ford standards, &quot;The Searchers&quot; is surely the best Western since &quot;Shane&quot;.&quot;

The film earned rentals of $4.8 million in the US and Canada during its first year of release.

=== Later assessments ===
Critic Roger Ebert found Wayne&#x27;s character, Ethan Edwards, &quot;one of the most compelling characters Ford and Wayne ever created&quot;. Ebert writes: &quot;&quot;The Searchers&quot; indeed seems to be two films. The Ethan Edwards story is stark and lonely, a portrait of obsession, and in it we can see Schrader&#x27;s inspiration for Travis Bickle of &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;. [...] The film within this film involves the silly romantic subplot and characters hauled in for comic relief, including the Swedish neighbor Lars Jorgensen (John Qualen), who uses a vaudeville accent, and Mose Harper (Hank Worden), a half-wit treated like a mascot. [...] This second strand is without interest, and those who value &quot;The Searchers&quot; filter it out, patiently waiting for a return to the main story line.&quot;

&quot;The Searchers&quot; has been cited as one of the greatest films of all time, such as in the BFI&#x27;s decennial &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls. In 1972, &quot;The Searchers&quot; was ranked 18th; in 1992, 5th; in 2002, 11th; in 2012, 7th. In a 1959 &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; essay, Jean-Luc Godard compared the movie&#x27;s ending to the reuniting of Odysseus with Telemachus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. In 1963, he ranked &quot;The Searchers&quot; as the fourth-greatest American movie of the sound era, after &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932), &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940), and &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958). The 1998 American Film Institute 100 greatest American films list ranked &quot;The Searchers&quot; in 96th place, and the 2007 iteration of the list ranked it in 12th place. In 1998, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it 18th. In 2008, the American Film Institute named &quot;The Searchers&quot; as the greatest Western of all time. In 2010, Richard Corliss noted the film was &quot;now widely regarded as the greatest Western of the 1950s, the genre&#x27;s greatest decade&quot; and characterized it as a &quot;darkly profound study of obsession, racism, and heroic solitude&quot;.

The film currently maintains an 87% rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 9.1/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Searchers&quot; is an epic John Wayne Western that introduces dark ambivalence to the genre that remains fashionable today.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 94 out of 100 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The film has been recognized multiple times by the American Film Institute:
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies – #96
* AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #12
* AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 – #1 Western Film

On &quot;They Shoot Pictures Don&#x27;t They&quot;, a site which numerically calculates critical reception for any given film, &quot;The Searchers&quot; has been recognized as the ninth-most acclaimed movie ever made. Members of the Western Writers of America chose its title song as one of the top 100 Western songs of all time.

Scott McGee stated, &quot;... more than just making a social statement like other Westerns of the period were apt to do, Ford instills in &quot;The Searchers&quot; a visual poetry and a sense of melancholy that is rare in American films and rarer still to Westerns.&quot;

Glenn Frankel&#x27;s 2013 study of the film calls it &quot;the greatest Hollywood film that few people have seen&quot;.

== Critical interpretations ==

=== Race relations ===

A major theme of the film is the historical attitude of white settlers toward Native Americans. Ford was not the first to attempt this examination cinematically, but his depiction of harshness toward Native Americans was startling, particularly to later generations of viewers; Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;I think Ford was trying, imperfectly, even nervously, to depict racism that justified genocide.&quot; At the heart of &quot;The Searchers&quot; is Wayne&#x27;s performance as the angry, vengeful Ethan Edwards. From the beginning of his quest, he is quite clearly less interested in rescuing Debbie than in wreaking vengeance on the Comanches for the slaughter of his brother&#x27;s family.

In a 1964 interview with &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, Ford said, Film scholar Ed Lowry writes, &quot;[W]hile the Comanches are depicted as utterly ruthless, Ford ascribes motivations for their actions, and lends them a dignity befitting a proud civilization. Never do we see the Indian commit atrocities more appalling than those perpetrated by the white man. &quot;Wayne is plainly Ahab&quot;, wrote cultural critic Greil Marcus. &quot;He is the good American hero driving himself past all known limits and into madness, his commitment to honor and decency burned down to a core of vengeance.&quot; For Brenton Priestley, Ford indicates that Scar&#x27;s cruelty is also motivated by revenge (&quot;Two sons killed by white men. For each son, I take many... scalps.&quot;)

==== Miscegenation ====
The theme of miscegenation also runs through the film. Many critical analyses of &quot;The Searchers&quot; highlight Ethan&#x27;s view of Debbie as having been &quot;contaminated&quot; through her abduction and implied rape.

The rape of captive white women by the Comanche is an unspoken theme. No actual rape scene is depicted, but Alexandra Heller-Nicholas in her study of &quot;Rape-Revenge Films&quot; says, &quot;the abduction, captivity, and implied rape of Debbie (Natalie Wood)... drives the narrative&quot;; and Edward Buscombe points out a scene in which
&quot;[Ethan] turns off the trail to penetrate a narrow crevice in the rocks, and when he emerges, his savage stabbing with his knife seems to mimic a violent sexual act, drawing us &#x27;a picture&#x27; of the act of rape which obsesses him.&quot; Glenn Frankel writes that in real life, &quot;Rape was a fact of life for many captives, although it was seldom discussed by those women who escaped or were ransomed back to the white world.&quot;

Early on, Martin earns a sour look from Ethan when he admits to being one-eighth Cherokee. Ethan says repeatedly that he will kill his niece rather than have her live &quot;with a buck&quot;, that &quot;living with the Comanche ain&#x27;t living&quot;. Even one of the film&#x27;s gentler characters, Vera Miles&#x27;s Laurie, tells Martin when he explains he must protect his adoptive sister, &quot;Ethan will put a bullet in her brain. I tell you Martha would want him to.&quot; This outburst makes it clear that even the supposedly gentler characters hold the same fear of miscegenation.

Randy Roberts and James Olson write that Ethan Edwards:
:&quot;...is also an obsessed maniac. White settlers are not simply the advanced vanguard of civilization; they are racists. Indians are not just noble savages; they are savage killers. The frontier is not a place of opportunity; it is a wasteland... In the character of Ethan Edwards, John Wayne had extended the Western hero to the border of evil.

=== Ethan and Martha ===
An important plot undercurrent is the obvious mutual attraction between Ethan Edwards and his brother&#x27;s wife, Martha. Although no dialogue alludes to it, many visual references to their relationship are seen throughout the film. Some critics have suggested that this unspoken passion implies that Debbie—who is specifically described as eight years old, as Ethan returns from an eight-year absence—may be Ethan&#x27;s daughter. Such a situation would add further layers of nuance to Ethan&#x27;s obsessive search for Debbie, his revulsion at the thought that she might be living as a Native American, and his ultimate decision to bring her home—and then walk away. Beyond the ostensible motivations, it might depict a guilt-ridden father&#x27;s need to save the daughter he made by cuckolding his brother, then abandoned.

== Influence ==
&quot;The Searchers&quot; has influenced many films. David Lean watched the film repeatedly while preparing for &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; to help him get a sense of how to shoot a landscape. The entrance of Ethan Edwards in &quot;The Searchers&quot;, across a vast prairie, is echoed in the across-the-desert entrance of Sherif Ali in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Sam Peckinpah referenced the aftermath of the massacre and the funeral scene in &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965), and according to a 1974 review by Jay Cocks, Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; contains dialogue with &quot;direct tributes to such classics as John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; and John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot;.&quot;

Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Who&#x27;s That Knocking at My Door&quot; features a sequence in which the two primary characters discuss &quot;The Searchers&quot;. In 2012, in a &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll, Scorsese listed &quot;The Searchers&quot; as one of his all-time favorite films.

Scott McGee, writing for Turner Classic Movies, notes &quot;Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, John Milius, Paul Schrader, Wim Wenders, Jean-Luc Godard, and George Lucas have all been influenced and paid some form of homage to &quot;The Searchers&quot; in their work.&quot; Wenders&#x27; Palme d&#x27;Or-winning 1984 film &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; in particular has been cited for similarities.

The film influenced several aspects of George Lucas&#x27; film saga &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The scene in which Ethan Edwards discovers the flaming wreckage of his family homestead is reflected in 1977&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;, wherein the character Luke Skywalker finds that his homestead has been burned and destroyed by Imperial Stormtroopers. &quot;The Searchers&quot; was also an influence on the 2002 prequel film in the series, &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. In the film, Anakin Skywalker learns that one of his family members has been abducted by a group of Tusken Raiders (though the character&#x27;s mother is kidnapped, rather than a niece). Anakin massacres the kidnappers in vengeance, much like &quot;The Searchers&quot;&#x27; climactic battle in the Comanche camp. The opening scenes of &quot;Rogue One&quot; mirror those of &quot;The Searchers&quot;: the pig-tailed character of Jyn is hidden by her parents when their homestead is attacked in the same way little Debbie is saved by her parents when they are attacked by the Comanches.

Douglas Gordon&#x27;s 1995 artwork, &quot;5 Year Drive-By&quot;, stretches out &quot;The Searchers&quot; from the original 113-minute runtime to five years (reflecting the events of the movie taking place over a timespan of five years), playing at a speed of one frame every 24 minutes.

The 2007 film &quot;Searchers 2.0&quot; by Alex Cox includes many discussions of &quot;The Searchers&quot; as well as other revenge films. In the film, the characters attend a screening of a remake of &quot;The Searchers&quot; directed by Ted Post and starring James Mitchum as Ethan Edwards and Telly Savalas as Chief Cicatriz (Scar), though no such remake was ever made in reality (Ted Post had actually directed a remake of John Ford&#x27;s &quot;Stagecoach&quot;).

&quot;Breaking Bad&quot; creator Vince Gilligan stated that the ending to the show&#x27;s final episode, &quot;Felina&quot;, was influenced by the film.

The 2016 Canadian film &quot;Searchers&quot; is a partial remake of the film, in which an Inuk man in 1913 finds his wife and daughter have been kidnapped. However, co-director Zacharias Kunuk discarded the original&#x27;s plot about conflicts between white people and indigenous peoples, instead using only Inuit characters. Kunuk explained racism was not an intended theme of his film. Kunuk said he watched Western films in the Igloolik community hall as a boy, and declared &quot;The Searchers&quot; star John Wayne &quot;was our hero&quot;.

John Wayne&#x27;s repeatedly used line &quot;that&#x27;ll be the day&quot; inspired Buddy Holly to write the song &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; after seeing the film in a theater in Lubbock, Texas.

The title of the novel &quot;The Searcher&quot; by Tana French is an allusion to the film.

== Comic book adaptation ==
* Dell Comics published an adaptation of &quot;The Searchers&quot; in &quot;Dell Four Color&quot; #709 (June 1956), written by Leo Dorfman and drawn by Mike Roy. The comic book downplays Ethan&#x27;s racism and omits the final iconic scene of the film.

<text>Serene Velocity is a 1970 American experimental short film directed by Ernie Gehr. Gehr filmed it in the basement hallway of a Binghamton University academic building, using a static camera position and changing only the focal length of the camera. It is recognized as a key work of structural filmmaking and has been inducted into the U.S. National Film Registry.

==Description==
&quot;Serene Velocity&quot; lasts twenty-three minutes and is silent. To make the film, Gehr locked his camera down in the center of a hallway, shooting several individual frames at a time. After each set of exposures, he changed the focal length on the lens, zooming in and then out in increasing increments. What begins as a small difference in apparent distance several frames at a time expands to extreme closeups and wide shots jumping back and forth. By the end of the film, the zoom into the end of the hallway reveals a set of double doors with daylight filtering through.

==Production==

In early 1970 Gehr was at SUNY Binghamton while Larry Gottheim was beginning to form a film department. Gottheim was impressed with Gehr&#x27;s earlier short films &quot;Morning&quot; and &quot;Wait&quot;, and the two became acquainted when Gottheim replaced a damaged print of one of Gehr&#x27;s works. With the encouragement of Gottheim and Ken Jacobs, Gehr taught two courses there during the summer session. He had been interested in making a film that explored &quot;the intervals between frames–activating the screen plane from frame to frame more dynamically&quot;. One day during the session, Gehr was on his way to the film department&#x27;s editing rooms in a basement and thought of the hallway as an ideal place to film. A long, plain area appealed to him as a good space to &quot;maximize the tension between representation and abstraction&quot;.

Gehr began shooting test footage in the basement hallway. He tested mid-range and extreme focal lengths in &quot;bars&quot; of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 frames. He decided to use bars of 4 frames, projected at 16 frames per second. This would have been roughly equivalent to 6 frames at 24 frames per second, but Gehr chose a lower frame rate so that each frame would remain on screen longer, accentuating the optical effects. He was surprised by the physical effect of watching the footage and felt nauseated afterward.

The footage for &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; was shot over the course of one night. Gehr began filming once it was dark outside, planning to take a break for several hours and finish filming during sunrise. He started by alternating between focal lengths of 50 mm and 55 mm. After roughly of film, he moved each of the lengths apart by 5 mm, to 45 mm and 60 mm, then 40 mm and 65 mm, and so on. He marked off lengths in intervals of 5 mm on a piece of tape and gradually moved the lengths farther apart throughout filming. He manually recorded each frame, and without the use of a cable release his fingers became swollen from holding the shutter button. The process took longer than he had expected; he took only one break to use a restroom and held his head under water to keep awake.

==Analysis and interpretations==

Watching &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; produces the appearance of motion and other optical effects, positioning it as a cinematic version of op art. Gehr has noted that the effects of watching the film vary significantly based on which part of the screen the viewer focuses on. The composition of the screen is divided into five sections: the ceiling&#x27;s fluorescent lights and exit signs; the doors, water fountains, and ashtrays on the left and right walls; the reflections on the floor; and the doors in the center of the frame. The perspective lines point to the center of the frame, which would normally be the center of interest, but the motion along the margins of the frame draws attention away. Viewing the images as flat, two-dimensional spaces transforms the work into an abstract, flashing sign. Focusing on individual features of the successive images produces the illusion of motion. The illusion of depth perception can transform the image into an upright pyramid pointing into or out of the screen. Ken Jacobs emphasized this sense of thrusting and described &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; as a &quot;sexual metaphor, or sex-become cinema&quot;, and J. Hoberman described it as a &quot;piston-powered mandala&quot;.

Critics have often evaluated &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; as a metacinematic work. Noël Carroll pointed to the simplified procedure with which it was photographed as an example of minimalist cinema. Carroll wrote that the film, with its lack of movement, is an argument for &quot;the impression of movement&quot; as the essential characteristic of cinema. Critics have drawn parallels with Andy Warhol&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;Empire&quot;, an extended, continuous shot of the Empire State Building. Both films advance a philosophical argument with a lack of movement and an emphasis on the recording process.

Gilberto Perez characterized the building&#x27;s design as a descendant of Bauhaus architecture, calling it &quot;barren and dehumanizing&quot;. He interpreted &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; as &quot;neither a celebration–nor exactly a condemnation&quot; of Bauhaus minimalism.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Serene Velocity&quot; received a positive reaction from many of Gehr&#x27;s contemporaries, including Ken Jacobs, Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, Richard Foreman, Steve Reich, and Andrew Noren. However, the film received little coverage from the press upon its 1970 release, save for a mention by Jonas Mekas. In 1972, Bob Cowan wrote in his column for &quot;Take One&quot; that &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; was &quot;one of the few really unique films I have seen during the last few years…It is rare that a film, which on the surface seems to be only a technical tour-de-force, can lift one to such emotional heights as it develops from surprise to surprise.&quot; &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; cemented Gehr&#x27;s reputation as a structural filmmaker. He demurred to the term, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t know what that word really means–[Labels] stop people from actually seeing, actually experiencing the work.&quot;

&quot;Serene Velocity&quot; is part of Anthology Film Archives&#x27; Essential Cinema Repertory collection. In 2001, the United States Library of Congress named the film &quot;culturally significant&quot; and entered it into the National Film Registry. The film was preserved in 2006 by The Museum of Modern Art, which enlarged the original 16 mm print to 35 mm.

Director Laura Poitras began making films while taking a course that Gehr taught at the San Francisco Art Institute. The first film Gehr screened was &quot;Serene Velocity&quot;, and Poitras has identified it as an influence on her work. For their 2008 short film &quot;Lossless #4&quot;, Rebecca Baron and Douglas Goodwin used a digital reproduction of &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; as source material. They fed it through a motion estimation algorithm to create a vector representation of the apparent motion in the film. In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Poll of the Greatest Films of All Time, Noël Carroll listed &quot;Serene Velocity&quot; in his submission.

<text>Jackson DeForest Kelley (January 20, 1920 – June 11, 1999) was an American actor, screenwriter, poet, and singer. He was known for his roles in film and television Westerns and achieved international fame as Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy of the in the television and film series &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966–1991).

==Early life==
Kelley was born in Atlanta, Georgia. His mother was Clora (née Casey) and his father was Ernest David Kelley, a Baptist minister of Irish ancestry. Kelley was named after pioneering electronics engineer Lee de Forest. He later named his &quot;Star Trek&quot; character&#x27;s father &quot;David&quot; after his own father. Kelley had an older brother, Ernest Casey Kelley. Kelley was immersed in his father&#x27;s mission at his father&#x27;s church in Conyers, Georgia.

Before the end of his first year at Conyers, Kelley was regularly putting to use his musical talents, and often sang solo in morning church services. Kelley wanted to become a doctor like his uncle, but his family could not afford to send him to medical school. He began singing on local radio shows, including an appearance on WSB AM in Atlanta. As a result of Kelley&#x27;s radio work, he won an engagement with Lou Forbes and his orchestra at the Paramount Theater.

In 1934, the family left Conyers for Decatur, Georgia. He attended the Decatur Boys High School, where he played on the Decatur Bantams baseball team. Kelley also played football and other sports. Before his graduation in 1938, Kelley got a job as a drugstore car hop. He spent his weekends working in the local theaters.

He made his film debut in the chorus of &quot;New Moon&quot; (1940), and nearly secured the lead role in &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; (1942), but Alan Ladd was chosen instead.

During World War II, Kelley served as an enlisted man in the United States Army Air Forces from March 10, 1943, to January 28, 1946, assigned to the First Motion Picture Unit with the rank of private first class. After an extended stay in Long Beach, California, Kelley decided to pursue an acting career and relocate to Southern California permanently, living for a time with his uncle Casey. He worked as an usher in a local theater to earn enough money for the move. Kelley&#x27;s mother encouraged her son in his new career goal, but his father disliked the idea. While in California, Kelley was spotted by a Paramount Pictures scout while appearing in a United States Navy training film.

In 1945, Kelley married Carolyn Charlotte Meagher Dowling.

==Career==

===Early roles===

Kelley&#x27;s acting career began with the feature film &quot;Fear in the Night&quot; in 1947. The low-budget movie was a hit, bringing him to the attention of a national audience and giving Kelley reason to believe he would soon become a star. His next role, in &quot;Variety Girl&quot;, established him as a leading actor and resulted in the founding of his first fan club. Kelley did not become a leading man, however, and his wife Carolyn and he decided to move to New York City. He found work on stage and on live television, but after three years in New York, the Kelleys returned to Hollywood.

In California, he received a role in an installment of &quot;You Are There,&quot; anchored by Walter Cronkite. He played ranch owner Bob Kitteridge in the 1949 episode &quot;Legion of Old Timers&quot; of the television series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. This led to an appearance in &quot;Gunfight at the O.K. Corral&quot; as Morgan Earp (brother to Burt Lancaster&#x27;s Wyatt Earp), which in turn led to three movie offers, including &quot;Warlock&quot; with Henry Fonda and Anthony Quinn.

DeForest Kelley appeared in three episodes of the television series &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;. In 1957, he had a small role as a Southern officer in &quot;Raintree County&quot;, a Civil War film directed by Edward Dmytryk, alongside Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift, and Lee Marvin. He also appeared in leading roles as a U.S. Navy submarine captain in the World War II-set television series, &quot;The Silent Service&quot;. He appeared in season one, episode five, &quot;The Spearfish Delivers&quot;, as Commander Dempsey, and in the first episode of season two, &quot;The Archerfish Spits Straight&quot;, as Lieutenant Commander Enright. His future &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star Leonard Nimoy also appeared in two different episodes of the series around the same time.

Kelley appeared three times in various portrayals of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral; the first was in 1955, as Ike Clanton in the television series &quot;You Are There&quot;. Two years later, in the 1957 film Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, he played Morgan Earp. His third appearance was in a third-season &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode (broadcast originally on October 25, 1968), titled &quot;Spectre of the Gun&quot;, this time portraying Tom McLaury.

Kelley, known to colleagues as &quot;Dee&quot;, also appeared in episodes of &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Boots and Saddles&quot;, &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Riverboat&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, and &quot;Laredo&quot;. He appeared in the 1962 episode of &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;1800 Days to Justice&quot; and &quot;The Clover Throne&quot; as Willis. He had a small role in the movie &quot;The View from Pompey&#x27;s Head&quot;.

For nine years, Kelley primarily played villains. He built up an extensive list of credits, alternating between television and motion pictures. He was afraid of typecasting, though, so he broke away from villains by starring in &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; and a television pilot called &quot;333 Montgomery&quot;. The pilot was written by an ex-policeman named Gene Roddenberry, and a few years later, Kelley appeared in another Roddenberry pilot, &quot;Police Story&quot; (1967), that was again not developed into a series.

Kelley also appeared in at least one radio drama, the 1957 episode of &quot;Suspense&quot; entitled &quot;Flesh Peddler&quot;, in which series producer William M. Robson introduced him as &quot;a bright new luminary in the Hollywood firmament&quot;.

Kelley played a doctor several times before he did so in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 1956, nine years before being cast as Dr. McCoy, Kelley played a small supporting role as a medic in &quot;The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit&quot;, in which he utters the diagnosis &quot;This man&#x27;s dead, Captain&quot; and &quot;That man is dead&quot; to Gregory Peck. In 1962, he appeared in the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode titled &quot;The Decision&quot;, as a doctor sentenced to hang for the murder of a journalist. (The judge in this episode was portrayed by John Hoyt, who later portrayed Dr. Phillip John Boyce, one of Leonard McCoy&#x27;s predecessors, on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; pilot &quot;The Cage&quot;.) In 1963, he appeared in &quot;The Virginian&quot; episode &quot;Man of Violence&quot; as a &quot;drinking&quot; cavalry doctor with Leonard Nimoy as his patient. (That episode was written by John D. F. Black, who went on to become a writer-producer on &quot;Star Trek&quot;.) Just before &quot;Star Trek&quot; began filming, Kelley appeared as a doctor again, in the &quot;Laredo&quot; episode &quot;The Sound of Terror&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot;===

Kelley played Dr. Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy from 1966 to 1969 in &quot;Star Trek&quot; (Gene Roddenberry had offered Kelley the role of Spock in 1964, but he refused it).. He reprised the character in a voice-over role in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series (1973–74), and the first six &quot;Star Trek&quot; motion pictures (1979 to 1991). In 1987, he also had a cameo in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, the first episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, as Admiral Leonard McCoy, Starfleet Surgeon General Emeritus. Several aspects of Kelley&#x27;s background became part of McCoy&#x27;s characterization, including his pronunciation of &quot;nuclear&quot; as &quot;nucular&quot;.

Kelley became a good friend of &quot;Star Trek&quot; castmates William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, from their first meeting in 1964. During &quot;Trek&quot;&#x27;s first season, Kelley&#x27;s name was listed in the end credits along with the rest of the cast. Only Shatner and Nimoy were listed in the opening credits. As Kelley&#x27;s role grew in importance during the first season, he received a pay raise to about $2,500 per episode and received third billing starting in the second season after Nimoy. Despite the show&#x27;s recognition of Kelley as one of its stars, he was frustrated by the greater attention that Shatner received as its lead actor and that Nimoy received because of &quot;Spockamania&quot; among fans.Shy by his own admission, Kelley was the only cast member of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series program never to have written or published an autobiography; the authorized biography &quot;From Sawdust to Stardust&quot; (2005) was written posthumously by Terry Lee Rioux of Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas. Kelley regarded &quot;The Empath&quot; as his favorite &quot;Star Trek&quot; television episode.

===Later career===

After &quot;Star Trek&quot; was canceled in 1969, Kelley found himself a victim of the very typecasting he had so feared. In 1972, he was cast in the horror film &quot;Night of the Lepus&quot;. After that, Kelley made occasional appearances on television and in film, but essentially went into &quot;de facto&quot; retirement, other than playing McCoy in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film series. By 1978, he was earning up to $50,000 ($ today) annually from appearances at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions. Like other &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors, Kelley received little of the enormous profits that the franchise generated for Paramount, until Nimoy, as executive producer, helped arrange for Kelley to be paid $1 million for &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991), which was his final live-action film appearance. In 1987, he appeared in the first &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, in which he portrayed a 137-year-old Dr. McCoy. For his final film, Kelley provided the voice of Viking 1 in &quot;The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars&quot;. Later in life, Kelley developed an interest in poetry, eventually publishing the first of two books in an unfinished series, &quot;The Big Bird&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Dream Goes On&quot;.

In 1971, he appeared in &quot;Room 222&quot; as Matt Silverton, a student&#x27;s father.

In a TLC interview done in the late 1990s, Kelley joked that one of his biggest fears was that the words etched on his gravestone would be &quot;He&#x27;s dead, Jim&quot;. Kelley&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Newsweek&quot; began: &quot;We&#x27;re not even going to try to resist: He&#x27;s dead, Jim&quot;. He stated the year before his death that his legacy would be the many people McCoy had inspired to become doctors; &quot;That&#x27;s something that very few people can say they&#x27;ve done. I&#x27;m proud to say that I have&quot;. In 1991, Kelley received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1999, shortly before he died, he was awarded a Golden Boot award for his contribution to the genre of Western television and movies.

==Personal life==
Kelley married former actress Carolyn Charlotte Meagher Dowling in 1945, exchanging two 25-cent Indian rings. They met in 1942 when both were actors in a play and remained married for nearly 55 years until Kelley&#x27;s death, living in a humble one-story ranch house in Sherman Oaks, California. The couple, who had no children, &quot;...were the most loving couple you’ve ever seen in your life,&quot; said Star Trek&#x27;s Majel Barrett.

==Health and death==
Kelley was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1997, from which he died on June 11, 1999, aged 79, attended by his wife at the Motion Picture and Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. His remains were cremated and the ashes were spread over the Pacific Ocean.

<text>Shadow of a Doubt is a 1943 American psychological thriller film noir directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and starring Teresa Wright and Joseph Cotten. Written by Thornton Wilder, Sally Benson, and Alma Reville, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Story for Gordon McDonell.

The story follows Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton and her family who live in very quiet Santa Rosa, California. An unexpected visit by Charles Oakley, her charming and sophisticated Uncle Charlie, brings much excitement to the family and the small town. That excitement turns to fear as young Charlie slowly realizes her uncle is in fact a wanted serial murderer known as the &quot;Merry Widow&quot; killer. The fear escalates when Oakley realizes she knows his secret.

In 1991, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. Hitchcock&#x27;s favorite of all his films, &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; was also the one he enjoyed making the most.

==Plot==
Charles Oakley spots two detectives outside his Newark, New Jersey hotel room and gives them the slip. He telegraphs his sister Emma Newton in Santa Rosa, California to let her know he will visit. His niece Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton is bored with her family&#x27;s routine and visits the telegraph office to invite Uncle Charlie to visit. While there she learns he has already sent a telegram announcing his visit.

Uncle Charlie arrives bearing extravagant gifts for everyone: a watch for his brother-in-law, a fur for his sister, and an emerald ring for his niece. Young Charlie notices the ring is engraved with someone else&#x27;s initials.

Two men appear at the Newton home pretending to survey a typical American family. They go to great lengths to take Uncle Charlie&#x27;s picture. Young Charlie guesses they are undercover detectives. They explain that her uncle is one of two suspects in a nationwide manhunt. Charlie refuses to believe it at first, but she learns that the initials engraved inside her emerald ring match one of the victims of the Merry Widow Murderer. She eyes her uncle with growing suspicion and dread.

During dinner one night, Uncle Charlie rants about rich widows, describing them as &quot;fat, wheezing animals.&quot; Horrified, young Charlie runs out of the house. Uncle Charlie follows her and takes her to a seedy bar. He admits he is one of the two murder suspects and begs her for help. She reluctantly agrees not to say anything since she wants to avoid a disgrace that would destroy her mother, who adores her younger brother.

The two detectives confide in young Charlie that the picture they took of her uncle has been sent east for identification by a witness. News breaks that the other Merry Widow suspect was killed while being chased by police. Everyone assumes he was the actual murderer. Uncle Charlie is delighted to be cleared, but young Charlie still suspects him. Later she falls down the back porch stairs, which she discovers were deliberately sabotaged.

Uncle Charlie reveals he wants to settle down in Santa Rosa. Young Charlie is appalled, but he reminds her there is no proof that he is a killer since he has taken back the emerald ring with the initials. Young Charlie says she will kill him if he stays. Later that night, Uncle Charlie leaves the car idling in the garage and traps Young Charlie inside with the car belching exhaust fumes. A neighbor hears her struggling and alerts the Newtons. Uncle Charlie makes a show of saving her.

Young Charlie finds the emerald ring in her uncle&#x27;s room and puts it on. When Uncle Charlie sees it on her finger, he abruptly announces he is leaving for San Francisco—coincidentally on the same train as Mrs. Porter, a rich widow. At the station, Uncle Charlie invites his niece onboard to see his compartment. When the train starts to move, he stops her from leaving and explains he has to kill her because she knows too much. He tries to throw young Charlie from a train door, but she manages to change positions with him. Uncle Charlie then tells her to wait for the train to speed up and she pushes him into the path of an oncoming train, killing him.

At his funeral, Uncle Charlie is honored by the townspeople, who are unaware of his crimes. Young Charlie laments to one of the detectives that they know he was the Merry Widow Murderer, but they resolve to keep Uncle Charlie&#x27;s crimes a secret.

==Cast==

* Teresa Wright as Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Newton who initially idolizes her loving uncle. Wright was given the screenplay, and pursued the role of Charlie due to her adoration of Hitchcock&#x27;s work.

* Macdonald Carey as Detective Jack Graham
* Henry Travers as Joseph Newton, Young Charlie&#x27;s father, who loves to read crime stories.
* Patricia Collinge as Emma Newton, Young Charlie&#x27;s mother and Uncle Charlie&#x27;s sister. Emma was named after Hitchcock&#x27;s mother, who died during production of the film.

* Edna May Wonacott as Ann Newton. Wonacott was chosen for the role of Ann Newton by Alfred Hitchcock while they were waiting for a bus. She had no previous acting experience, and had to be coached by Hitchcock&#x27;s daughter between takes. Wonacott had received a seven-year contract with a film studio, and Hitchcock believed she would have a successful acting career.

====Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo====
Alfred Hitchcock appears about 16 minutes into the film, on the train to Santa Rosa, playing bridge with Doctor and Mrs. Harry. Charlie is traveling on the train under the assumed name of Otis, and is lying down due to a migraine. Mrs. Harry is eager to help him, but her husband is not interested and keeps playing bridge. Doctor Harry replies to Hitchcock that he does not look well while Hitchcock is holding a full suit of spades, the best hand for bridge.

==Production==

The project began when the head of David Selznick&#x27;s story department, Margaret McDonell, told Hitchcock that her husband Gordon had an interesting idea for a novel that she thought would make a good movie. His idea, called &quot;Uncle Charlie&quot;, was based on the true story of Earle Nelson, a serial killer of the late 1920s known as &quot;the Gorilla Man&quot;.

&quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; was both filmed and set in Santa Rosa, California, which was portrayed as a paragon of a supposedly peaceful, small, pre-War American city. Since Thornton Wilder wrote the original script, the story is set in a small American town, a popular setting of Wilder&#x27;s, but with an added Hitchcock touch to it. The director specifically wanted Wilder to work on McDonell&#x27;s nine-page treatment because he admired &quot;Our Town&quot;. In Patrick McGilligan&#x27;s biography of Hitchcock, he said the film was perhaps the most American film that Hitchcock had made up to that time.

The opening scenes take place in the East Ward (aka the &quot;Ironbound&quot;/&quot;Down Neck&quot; section of Newark, New Jersey). The city skyline and landmarks such as the Pulaski Skyway are featured in the opening shot. The location shots were used to comply with the wartime War Production Board restrictions of a maximum cost of $5,000 for set construction.

An Italianate-style house, built in 1872, was used for exterior shots of the Newton family home. As of 2024, it is still standing, located at 904 McDonald Avenue in Santa Rosa.

The stone railway station in the film was built in 1904 for the Northwestern Pacific Railroad and is one of the few commercial buildings in central Santa Rosa to survive the earthquake of April 18, 1906. The station is currently a visitor center and passenger service is provided by the Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit system. The library was a Carnegie Library which was demolished in 1964 due to seismic concerns. Some of the buildings in the center of Santa Rosa that are seen in the film were damaged or destroyed by earthquakes in 1969; much of the area was cleared of debris and largely rebuilt.

The film was scored by Dimitri Tiomkin, his first collaboration with Hitchcock (the others being &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;, &quot;I Confess&quot; and &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;). In his score, Tiomkin quotes the &quot;Merry Widow Waltz&quot; of Franz Lehár, often in somewhat distorted forms, as a leitmotif for Uncle Charlie and his serial murders. During the opening credits, the waltz theme is heard along with a prolonged shot of couples dancing. The image recurs frequently throughout the film, and Lehár&#x27;s melody is an earworm for several characters. When Young Charlie is on the verge of identifying it at the dinner table, Uncle Charlie distracts her.

==Cinematography==

Cinematographer Joseph A. Valentine described his work on the film: &quot;Our Santa Rosa location was chosen because it seemed to be typical of the average American small city, and offered, as well, the physical facilities the script demanded. There was a public square, around which much of the city&#x27;s life resolves. There was an indefinable blending of small town and city, and of old and new, which made the town a much more typical background of an average American town than anything that could have been deliberately designed. The Santa Rosans were very cooperative, and most of our problems in these scenes were the ordinary ones of rigging scrims and placing reflectors or booster lights where they were needed.&quot;

&quot;The most spectacular part of our work was naturally the making of the night exterior sequences. We had with us two generator sets, ten 150-ampere arc spotlights, and the usual assortment of incandescent lights...making a total of 3,000 ampere maximum electrical capacity. With this we lit up an expanse of four city blocks for our night-effect long shots!...Oddly enough, one of our less spectacular night scenes proved really the harder problem. This was a sequence played around the city&#x27;s public library. This building is a lovely Gothic structure, almost completely clothed in ivy. I think all of us were surprised at the way those dark green ivy leaves drank up the light. Actually, on our long shots of that single building we used every unit of lighting equipment we had with us—and we could very conveniently have used more if we had had them!...Frequently people who have seen these night scenes of ours have jumped to the conclusion that with such an area to illuminate we must have filmed them by day with Infra-Red film rather than actually by night. If only they&#x27;d seen how we worked to finish our night scenes before the Pacific Coast&#x27;s &quot;dim-out&quot; order [of WWII] went into effect, they&#x27;d change their minds. All of our night scenes were filmed actually at night—and we just got under the wire, finishing the last one scarcely a matter of hours before the dim-out became effective.&quot;

==Reception==

Upon release, the film received unanimously positive reviews. Bosley Crowther, critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, loved the film, stating that &quot;Hitchcock could raise more goose pimples to the square inch of a customer&#x27;s flesh than any other director in Hollywood&quot;. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; called the film &quot;superb&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; stated that &quot;Hitchcock deftly etches his small-town characters and homey surroundings&quot;. The entertainment trade paper &quot;The Film Daily&quot; was yet another reviewer in 1943 that praised every aspect of the production. The publication predicted big box office for theaters presenting Hitchcock&#x27;s latest work:

In a 1964 interview on &quot;Telescope&quot; with host Fletcher Markle, Markle noted, &quot;Mr. Hitchcock, most critics have always considered &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;, which you made in 1943, as your finest film.&quot; Hitchcock replied immediately, &quot;Me too.&quot; Markle then asked, &quot;That is your opinion of it still?&quot; Hitchcock replied, &quot;Oh, no question.&quot; At the time, Hitchcock&#x27;s most recent work was &quot;Marnie&quot;. When later interviewed by François Truffaut, Hitchcock denied the suggestion that &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; was his &quot;favourite&quot;. But in the audio interview with Truffaut, Hitchcock confirmed it was his favourite film, and later reiterated that &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; was his favorite film in his interview with Mike Douglas in 1969 and in his interview with Dick Cavett in 1972. Hitchcock&#x27;s daughter Pat Hitchcock also said that her father&#x27;s favorite film was &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot;. Hitchcock also enjoyed making &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; the most, due to his &quot;pleasant memories of working on it with Thornton Wilder&quot; according to his conversation with Truffaut.

Today, the film is still regarded as a major work of Hitchcock&#x27;s. Contemporary critic Dave Kehr called it Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;first indisputable masterpiece.&quot; In 2005 film critic David Denby of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it Hitchcock&#x27;s most &quot;intimate and heart-wrenching&quot; film. Based on 48 reviews on the website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received a 100% approval rating, with a weighted average of 9.20/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s earliest classic — and his own personal favorite — deals its flesh-crawling thrills as deftly as its finely shaded characters&quot;. On Metacritic it has a score of 94 out of 100, based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. When asked by critics as to an overarching theme for the film Hitchcock responded: &quot;Love and good order is no defense against evil&quot;. In his book &quot;Bambi vs. Godzilla&quot;, David Mamet calls it Hitchcock&#x27;s finest film. In his 2011 review of the film, film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his Great Movies list. In 2022, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked the film at No. 41 on their list of &quot;The 100 best thriller films of all time&quot;.

==Adaptations and remakes==
===Radio===
The film was adapted for Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;Lux Radio Theater&quot; aired on January 3, 1944, with its original leading actress Teresa Wright and William Powell as Uncle Charlie (Patrick McGilligan said Hitchcock had originally wanted Powell to play Uncle Charlie, but MGM refused to lend the actor for the film). In 1950, &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; was featured as a radio-play on &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;. It starred Cary Grant as Uncle Charlie and Betsy Drake as the young Charlie. It was also adapted to the Ford Theater (February 18, 1949). &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; adapted the film twice with Joseph Cotten, the first with Vanessa Brown as young Charlie, and the second with Deanna Durbin in the role. The &quot;Academy Award Theater&quot; production of &quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; was aired on September 11, 1946.

===Film===
The film has been remade twice: in 1958 as &quot;Step Down to Terror&quot;, and again (under the original title) as a 1991 TV movie in which Mark Harmon portrayed Uncle Charlie.

&quot;Shadow of a Doubt&quot; influenced the beginning of Park Chan-wook&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;Stoker&quot;.

<text>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique with applications in exploratory data analysis, visualization and data preprocessing.

The data is linearly transformed onto a new coordinate system such that the directions (principal components) capturing the largest variation in the data can be easily identified.

The principal components of a collection of points in a real coordinate space are a sequence of formula_1 unit vectors, where the formula_2-th vector is the direction of a line that best fits the data while being orthogonal to the first formula_3 vectors. Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared perpendicular distance from the points to the line. These directions (i.e., principal components) constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Many studies use the first two principal components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely related data points.

Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science.

== Overview ==
When performing PCA, the first principal component of a set of formula_1 variables is the derived variable formed as a linear combination of the original variables that explains the most variance. The second principal component explains the most variance in what is left once the effect of the first component is removed, and we may proceed through formula_1 iterations until all the variance is explained. PCA is most commonly used when many of the variables are highly correlated with each other and it is desirable to reduce their number to an independent set.
The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The formula_2-th principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first formula_3 principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data.

For either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data&#x27;s covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain-specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard PCA have also been proposed.

== History ==

PCA was invented in 1901 by Karl Pearson, as an analogue of the principal axis theorem in mechanics; it was later independently developed and named by Harold Hotelling in the 1930s. Depending on the field of application, it is also named the discrete Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT) in signal processing, the Hotelling transform in multivariate quality control, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in mechanical engineering, singular value decomposition (SVD) of X (invented in the last quarter of the 19th century), eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of XTX in linear algebra, factor analysis (for a discussion of the differences between PCA and factor analysis see Ch. 7 of Jolliffe&#x27;s &quot;Principal Component Analysis&quot;), Eckart–Young theorem (Harman, 1960), or empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) in meteorological science (Lorenz, 1956), empirical eigenfunction decomposition (Sirovich, 1987), quasiharmonic modes (Brooks et al., 1988), spectral decomposition in noise and vibration, and empirical modal analysis in structural dynamics.

== Intuition ==
PCA can be thought of as fitting a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional ellipsoid to the data, where each axis of the ellipsoid represents a principal component. If some axis of the ellipsoid is small, then the variance along that axis is also small.

To find the axes of the ellipsoid, we must first center the values of each variable in the dataset on 0 by subtracting the mean of the variable&#x27;s observed values from each of those values. These transformed values are used instead of the original observed values for each of the variables. Then, we compute the covariance matrix of the data and calculate the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of this covariance matrix. Then we must normalize each of the orthogonal eigenvectors to turn them into unit vectors. Once this is done, each of the mutually-orthogonal unit eigenvectors can be interpreted as an axis of the ellipsoid fitted to the data. This choice of basis will transform the covariance matrix into a diagonalized form, in which the diagonal elements represent the variance of each axis. The proportion of the variance that each eigenvector represents can be calculated by dividing the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector by the sum of all eigenvalues.

Biplots and scree plots (degree of explained variance) are used to interpret findings of the PCA. 

== Details ==
PCA is defined as an orthogonal linear transformation on a real inner product space that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.

Consider an formula_8 data matrix, X, with column-wise zero empirical mean (the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero), where each of the &quot;n&quot; rows represents a different repetition of the experiment, and each of the &quot;p&quot; columns gives a particular kind of feature (say, the results from a particular sensor).

Mathematically, the transformation is defined by a set of size formula_9 of &quot;p&quot;-dimensional vectors of weights or coefficients formula_10 that map each row vector formula_11 of X to a new vector of principal component &quot;scores&quot; formula_12, given by

:formula_13
in such a way that the individual variables formula_14 of t considered over the data set successively inherit the maximum possible variance from X, with each coefficient vector w constrained to be a unit vector (where formula_9 is usually selected to be strictly less than formula_1 to reduce dimensionality).

The above may equivalently be written in matrix form as 
:formula_17
where
formula_18,
formula_19, and
formula_20.

=== First component ===
In order to maximize variance, the first weight vector w(1) thus has to satisfy
:formula_21

Equivalently, writing this in matrix form gives
:formula_22

Since w(1) has been defined to be a unit vector, it equivalently also satisfies
:formula_23

The quantity to be maximised can be recognised as a Rayleigh quotient. A standard result for a positive semidefinite matrix such as XTX is that the quotient&#x27;s maximum possible value is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix, which occurs when w is the corresponding eigenvector.

With w(1) found, the first principal component of a data vector x(&quot;i&quot;) can then be given as a score &quot;t&quot;1(&quot;i&quot;) = x(&quot;i&quot;) ⋅ w(1) in the transformed co-ordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the original variables, {x(&quot;i&quot;) ⋅ w(1)} w(1).

=== Further components ===
The &quot;k&quot;-th component can be found by subtracting the first &quot;k&quot; − 1 principal components from X:

:formula_24

and then finding the weight vector which extracts the maximum variance from this new data matrix
:formula_25

It turns out that this gives the remaining eigenvectors of XTX, with the maximum values for the quantity in brackets given by their corresponding eigenvalues. Thus the weight vectors are eigenvectors of XTX.

The &quot;k&quot;-th principal component of a data vector x(&quot;i&quot;) can therefore be given as a score &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) = x(&quot;i&quot;) ⋅ w(&quot;k&quot;) in the transformed coordinates, or as the corresponding vector in the space of the original variables, {x(&quot;i&quot;) ⋅ w(&quot;k&quot;)} w(&quot;k&quot;), where w(&quot;k&quot;) is the &quot;k&quot;th eigenvector of XTX.

The full principal components decomposition of X can therefore be given as
:formula_17
where W is a &quot;p&quot;-by-&quot;p&quot; matrix of weights whose columns are the eigenvectors of XTX. The transpose of W is sometimes called the whitening or sphering transformation. Columns of W multiplied by the square root of corresponding eigenvalues, that is, eigenvectors scaled up by the variances, are called &quot;loadings&quot; in PCA or in Factor analysis.

=== Covariances ===
XTX itself can be recognized as proportional to the empirical sample covariance matrix of the dataset XT.

The sample covariance &quot;Q&quot; between two of the different principal components over the dataset is given by:

:formula_27

where the eigenvalue property of w(&quot;k&quot;) has been used to move from line 2 to line 3. However eigenvectors w(&quot;j&quot;) and w(&quot;k&quot;) corresponding to eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal (if the eigenvalues are different), or can be orthogonalised (if the vectors happen to share an equal repeated value). The product in the final line is therefore zero; there is no sample covariance between different principal components over the dataset.

Another way to characterise the principal components transformation is therefore as the transformation to coordinates which diagonalise the empirical sample covariance matrix.

In matrix form, the empirical covariance matrix for the original variables can be written
:formula_28

The empirical covariance matrix between the principal components becomes
:formula_29

where Λ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of XTX. &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is equal to the sum of the squares over the dataset associated with each component &quot;k&quot;, that is, &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) = Σ&quot;i&quot; &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot;2(&quot;i&quot;) = Σ&quot;i&quot; (x(&quot;i&quot;) ⋅ w(&quot;k&quot;))2.

=== Dimensionality reduction ===
The transformation T = X W maps a data vector x(&quot;i&quot;) from an original space of &quot;p&quot; variables to a new space of &quot;p&quot; variables which are uncorrelated over the dataset. However, not all the principal components need to be kept. Keeping only the first &quot;L&quot; principal components, produced by using only the first &quot;L&quot; eigenvectors, gives the truncated transformation

:formula_30

where the matrix TL now has &quot;n&quot; rows but only &quot;L&quot; columns. In other words, PCA learns a linear transformation formula_31 where the columns of matrix formula_32 form an orthogonal basis for the &quot;L&quot; features (the components of representation &quot;t&quot;) that are decorrelated. By construction, of all the transformed data matrices with only &quot;L&quot; columns, this score matrix maximises the variance in the original data that has been preserved, while minimising the total squared reconstruction error formula_33 or formula_34.
Such dimensionality reduction can be a very useful step for visualising and processing high-dimensional datasets, while still retaining as much of the variance in the dataset as possible. For example, selecting &quot;L&quot; = 2 and keeping only the first two principal components finds the two-dimensional plane through the high-dimensional dataset in which the data is most spread out, so if the data contains clusters these too may be most spread out, and therefore most visible to be plotted out in a two-dimensional diagram; whereas if two directions through the data (or two of the original variables) are chosen at random, the clusters may be much less spread apart from each other, and may in fact be much more likely to substantially overlay each other, making them indistinguishable.

Similarly, in regression analysis, the larger the number of explanatory variables allowed, the greater is the chance of overfitting the model, producing conclusions that fail to generalise to other datasets. One approach, especially when there are strong correlations between different possible explanatory variables, is to reduce them to a few principal components and then run the regression against them, a method called principal component regression.

Dimensionality reduction may also be appropriate when the variables in a dataset are noisy. If each column of the dataset contains independent identically distributed Gaussian noise, then the columns of T will also contain similarly identically distributed Gaussian noise (such a distribution is invariant under the effects of the matrix W, which can be thought of as a high-dimensional rotation of the co-ordinate axes). However, with more of the total variance concentrated in the first few principal components compared to the same noise variance, the proportionate effect of the noise is less—the first few components achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio. PCA thus can have the effect of concentrating much of the signal into the first few principal components, which can usefully be captured by dimensionality reduction; while the later principal components may be dominated by noise, and so disposed of without great loss. If the dataset is not too large, the significance of the principal components can be tested using parametric bootstrap, as an aid in determining how many principal components to retain.

=== Singular value decomposition ===

The principal components transformation can also be associated with another matrix factorization, the singular value decomposition (SVD) of X,
:formula_35
Here Σ is an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;p&quot; rectangular diagonal matrix of positive numbers &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), called the singular values of X; U is an &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrix, the columns of which are orthogonal unit vectors of length &quot;n&quot; called the left singular vectors of X; and W is a &quot;p&quot;-by-&quot;p&quot; matrix whose columns are orthogonal unit vectors of length &quot;p&quot; and called the right singular vectors of X.

In terms of this factorization, the matrix XTX can be written
:formula_36

where formula_37 is the square diagonal matrix with the singular values of X and the excess zeros chopped off that satisfies formula_38. Comparison with the eigenvector factorization of XTX establishes that the right singular vectors W of X are equivalent to the eigenvectors of XTX, while the singular values &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of formula_39 are equal to the square-root of the eigenvalues &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of XTX.

Using the singular value decomposition the score matrix T can be written
:formula_40
so each column of T is given by one of the left singular vectors of X multiplied by the corresponding singular value. This form is also the polar decomposition of T.

Efficient algorithms exist to calculate the SVD of X without having to form the matrix XTX, so computing the SVD is now the standard way to calculate a principal components analysis from a data matrix, unless only a handful of components are required.

As with the eigen-decomposition, a truncated score matrix TL can be obtained by considering only the first L largest singular values and their singular vectors:
:formula_41
The truncation of a matrix M or T using a truncated singular value decomposition in this way produces a truncated matrix that is the nearest possible matrix of rank &quot;L&quot; to the original matrix, in the sense of the difference between the two having the smallest possible Frobenius norm, a result known as the Eckart–Young theorem [1936].

== Further considerations ==

The singular values (in Σ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix XTX. Each eigenvalue is proportional to the portion of the &quot;variance&quot; (more correctly of the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean) that is associated with each eigenvector. The sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the squared distances of the points from their multidimensional mean. PCA essentially rotates the set of points around their mean in order to align with the principal components. This moves as much of the variance as possible (using an orthogonal transformation) into the first few dimensions. The values in the remaining dimensions, therefore, tend to be small and may be dropped with minimal loss of information (see below). PCA is often used in this manner for dimensionality reduction. PCA has the distinction of being the optimal orthogonal transformation for keeping the subspace that has largest &quot;variance&quot; (as defined above). This advantage, however, comes at the price of greater computational requirements if compared, for example, and when applicable, to the discrete cosine transform, and in particular to the DCT-II which is simply known as the &quot;DCT&quot;. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques tend to be more computationally demanding than PCA.

PCA is sensitive to the scaling of the variables. If we have just two variables and they have the same sample variance and are completely correlated, then the PCA will entail a rotation by 45° and the &quot;weights&quot; (they are the cosines of rotation) for the two variables with respect to the principal component will be equal. But if we multiply all values of the first variable by 100, then the first principal component will be almost the same as that variable, with a small contribution from the other variable, whereas the second component will be almost aligned with the second original variable. This means that whenever the different variables have different units (like temperature and mass), PCA is a somewhat arbitrary method of analysis. (Different results would be obtained if one used Fahrenheit rather than Celsius for example.) Pearson&#x27;s original paper was entitled &quot;On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space&quot; – &quot;in space&quot; implies physical Euclidean space where such concerns do not arise. One way of making the PCA less arbitrary is to use variables scaled so as to have unit variance, by standardizing the data and hence use the autocorrelation matrix instead of the autocovariance matrix as a basis for PCA. However, this compresses (or expands) the fluctuations in all dimensions of the signal space to unit variance.

Mean subtraction (a.k.a. &quot;mean centering&quot;) is necessary for performing classical PCA to ensure that the first principal component describes the direction of maximum variance. If mean subtraction is not performed, the first principal component might instead correspond more or less to the mean of the data. A mean of zero is needed for finding a basis that minimizes the mean square error of the approximation of the data.

Mean-centering is unnecessary if performing a principal components analysis on a correlation matrix, as the data are already centered after calculating correlations. Correlations are derived from the cross-product of two standard scores (Z-scores) or statistical moments (hence the name: &quot;Pearson Product-Moment Correlation&quot;). Also see the article by Kromrey &amp; Foster-Johnson (1998) on &quot;Mean-centering in Moderated Regression: Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. Since covariances are correlations of normalized variables (Z- or standard-scores) a PCA based on the correlation matrix of X is equal to a PCA based on the covariance matrix of Z, the standardized version of X.

PCA is a popular primary technique in pattern recognition. It is not, however, optimized for class separability. However, it has been used to quantify the distance between two or more classes by calculating center of mass for each class in principal component space and reporting Euclidean distance between center of mass of two or more classes. The linear discriminant analysis is an alternative which is optimized for class separability.

== Properties and limitations ==

=== Properties ===

Some properties of PCA include:

:&quot;Property 1&quot;: For any integer &quot;q&quot;, 1 ≤ &quot;q&quot; ≤ &quot;p&quot;, consider the orthogonal linear transformation
::formula_42
:where formula_43 is a &quot;q-element&quot; vector and formula_44 is a (&quot;q&quot; × &quot;p&quot;) matrix, and let formula_45 be the variance-covariance matrix for formula_43. Then the trace of formula_47, denoted formula_48, is maximized by taking formula_49, where formula_50 consists of the first &quot;q&quot; columns of formula_51 formula_52 is the transpose of formula_53. (formula_51 is not defined here)

:&quot;Property 2&quot;: Consider again the orthonormal transformation
::formula_55
:with formula_56 and formula_47 defined as before. Then formula_58 is minimized by taking formula_59 where formula_60 consists of the last &quot;q&quot; columns of formula_51.

The statistical implication of this property is that the last few PCs are not simply unstructured left-overs after removing the important PCs. Because these last PCs have variances as small as possible they are useful in their own right. They can help to detect unsuspected near-constant linear relationships between the elements of , and they may also be useful in regression, in selecting a subset of variables from , and in outlier detection.

:&quot;Property 3&quot;: (Spectral decomposition of )
::formula_62

Before we look at its usage, we first look at diagonal elements,
:formula_63
Then, perhaps the main statistical implication of the result is that not only can we decompose the combined variances of all the elements of into decreasing contributions due to each PC, but we can also decompose the whole covariance matrix into contributions formula_64 from each PC. Although not strictly decreasing, the elements of formula_64 will tend to become smaller as formula_66 increases, as formula_64 is nonincreasing for increasing formula_66, whereas the elements of formula_69 tend to stay about the same size because of the normalization constraints: formula_70.

=== Limitations ===

As noted above, the results of PCA depend on the scaling of the variables. This can be cured by scaling each feature by its standard deviation, so that one ends up with dimensionless features with unital variance.

The applicability of PCA as described above is limited by certain (tacit) assumptions made in its derivation. In particular, PCA can capture linear correlations between the features but fails when this assumption is violated (see Figure 6a in the reference). In some cases, coordinate transformations can restore the linearity assumption and PCA can then be applied (see kernel PCA).

Another limitation is the mean-removal process before constructing the covariance matrix for PCA. In fields such as astronomy, all the signals are non-negative, and the mean-removal process will force the mean of some astrophysical exposures to be zero, which consequently creates unphysical negative fluxes, and forward modeling has to be performed to recover the true magnitude of the signals. As an alternative method, non-negative matrix factorization focusing only on the non-negative elements in the matrices is well-suited for astrophysical observations. See more at the relation between PCA and non-negative matrix factorization.

PCA is at a disadvantage if the data has not been standardized before applying the algorithm to it. PCA transforms the original data into data that is relevant to the principal components of that data, which means that the new data variables cannot be interpreted in the same ways that the originals were. They are linear interpretations of the original variables. Also, if PCA is not performed properly, there is a high likelihood of information loss.

PCA relies on a linear model. If a dataset has a pattern hidden inside it that is nonlinear, then PCA can actually steer the analysis in the complete opposite direction of progress. Researchers at Kansas State University discovered that the sampling error in their experiments impacted the bias of PCA results. &quot;If the number of subjects or blocks is smaller than 30, and/or the researcher is interested in PC&#x27;s beyond the first, it may be better to first correct for the serial correlation, before PCA is conducted&quot;. The researchers at Kansas State also found that PCA could be &quot;seriously biased if the autocorrelation structure of the data is not correctly handled&quot;.

=== PCA and information theory ===
Dimensionality reduction results in a loss of information, in general. PCA-based dimensionality reduction tends to minimize that information loss, under certain signal and noise models.

Under the assumption that

:formula_71

that is, that the data vector formula_72 is the sum of the desired information-bearing signal formula_73 and a noise signal formula_74 one can show that PCA can be optimal for dimensionality reduction, from an information-theoretic point-of-view.

In particular, Linsker showed that if formula_73 is Gaussian and formula_74 is Gaussian noise with a covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix, the PCA maximizes the mutual information formula_77 between the desired information formula_73 and the dimensionality-reduced output formula_79.

If the noise is still Gaussian and has a covariance matrix proportional to the identity matrix (that is, the components of the vector formula_74 are iid), but the information-bearing signal formula_73 is non-Gaussian (which is a common scenario), PCA at least minimizes an upper bound on the &quot;information loss&quot;, which is defined as

:formula_82

The optimality of PCA is also preserved if the noise formula_74 is iid and at least more Gaussian (in terms of the Kullback–Leibler divergence) than the information-bearing signal formula_73. In general, even if the above signal model holds, PCA loses its information-theoretic optimality as soon as the noise formula_74 becomes dependent.

== Computation using the covariance method ==

The following is a detailed description of PCA using the covariance method as opposed to the correlation method.

The goal is to transform a given data set X of dimension &quot;p&quot; to an alternative data set Y of smaller dimension &quot;L&quot;. Equivalently, we are seeking to find the matrix Y, where Y is the Karhunen–Loève transform (KLT) of matrix X:

formula_86
== Derivation using the covariance method ==

Let X be a &quot;d&quot;-dimensional random vector expressed as column vector. Without loss of generality, assume X has zero mean.

We want to find formula_87 a orthonormal transformation matrix P so that PX has a diagonal covariance matrix (that is, PX is a random vector with all its distinct components pairwise uncorrelated).

A quick computation assuming formula_88 were unitary yields:

:formula_89

Hence formula_87 holds if and only if formula_91 were diagonalisable by formula_88.

This is very constructive, as cov(X) is guaranteed to be a non-negative definite matrix and thus is guaranteed to be diagonalisable by some unitary matrix.

== Covariance-free computation ==

In practical implementations, especially with high dimensional data (large ), the naive covariance method is rarely used because it is not efficient due to high computational and memory costs of explicitly determining the covariance matrix. The covariance-free approach avoids the operations of explicitly calculating and storing the covariance matrix , instead utilizing one of matrix-free methods, for example, based on the function evaluating the product at the cost of operations.

=== Iterative computation ===

One way to compute the first principal component efficiently is shown in the following pseudo-code, for a data matrix with zero mean, without ever computing its covariance matrix.

 = a random vector of length 
 r = r / norm(r)
 do times:
 (a vector of length )
 
 
 
 return 

This power iteration algorithm simply calculates the vector , normalizes, and places the result back in . The eigenvalue is approximated by , which is the Rayleigh quotient on the unit vector for the covariance matrix . If the largest singular value is well separated from the next largest one, the vector gets close to the first principal component of within the number of iterations , which is small relative to , at the total cost . The power iteration convergence can be accelerated without noticeably sacrificing the small cost per iteration using more advanced matrix-free methods, such as the Lanczos algorithm or the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) method.

Subsequent principal components can be computed one-by-one via deflation or simultaneously as a block. In the former approach, imprecisions in already computed approximate principal components additively affect the accuracy of the subsequently computed principal components, thus increasing the error with every new computation. The latter approach in the block power method replaces single-vectors and with block-vectors, matrices and . Every column of approximates one of the leading principal components, while all columns are iterated simultaneously. The main calculation is evaluation of the product . Implemented, for example, in LOBPCG, efficient blocking eliminates the accumulation of the errors, allows using high-level BLAS matrix-matrix product functions, and typically leads to faster convergence, compared to the single-vector one-by-one technique.

=== The NIPALS method ===
&quot;Non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS)&quot; is a variant the classical power iteration with matrix deflation by subtraction implemented for computing the first few components in a principal component or partial least squares analysis. For very-high-dimensional datasets, such as those generated in the *omics sciences (for example, genomics, metabolomics) it is usually only necessary to compute the first few PCs. The non-linear iterative partial least squares (NIPALS) algorithm updates iterative approximations to the leading scores and loadings t1 and r1T by the power iteration multiplying on every iteration by X on the left and on the right, that is, calculation of the covariance matrix is avoided, just as in the matrix-free implementation of the power iterations to , based on the function evaluating the product .

The matrix deflation by subtraction is performed by subtracting the outer product, t1r1T from X leaving the deflated residual matrix used to calculate the subsequent leading PCs.
For large data matrices, or matrices that have a high degree of column collinearity, NIPALS suffers from loss of orthogonality of PCs due to machine precision round-off errors accumulated in each iteration and matrix deflation by subtraction. A Gram–Schmidt re-orthogonalization algorithm is applied to both the scores and the loadings at each iteration step to eliminate this loss of orthogonality. NIPALS reliance on single-vector multiplications cannot take advantage of high-level BLAS and results in slow convergence for clustered leading singular values—both these deficiencies are resolved in more sophisticated matrix-free block solvers, such as the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (LOBPCG) method.

=== Online/sequential estimation ===
In an &quot;online&quot; or &quot;streaming&quot; situation with data arriving piece by piece rather than being stored in a single batch, it is useful to make an estimate of the PCA projection that can be updated sequentially. This can be done efficiently, but requires different algorithms.

== Qualitative variables ==
In PCA, it is common that we want to introduce qualitative variables as supplementary elements. For example, many quantitative variables have been measured on plants. For these plants, some qualitative variables are available as, for example, the species to which the plant belongs. These data were subjected to PCA for quantitative variables. When analyzing the results, it is natural to connect the principal components to the qualitative variable &quot;species&quot;.
For this, the following results are produced.
* Identification, on the factorial planes, of the different species, for example, using different colors.
* Representation, on the factorial planes, of the centers of gravity of plants belonging to the same species.
* For each center of gravity and each axis, p-value to judge the significance of the difference between the center of gravity and origin.

These results are what is called &quot;introducing a qualitative variable as supplementary element&quot;. This procedure is detailed in and Husson, Lê, &amp; Pagès (2009) and Pagès (2013).
Few software offer this option in an &quot;automatic&quot; way. This is the case of SPAD that historically, following the work of Ludovic Lebart, was the first to propose this option, and the R package FactoMineR.

== Applications ==

=== Intelligence ===
The earliest application of factor analysis was in locating and measuring components of human intelligence. It was believed that intelligence had various uncorrelated components such as spatial intelligence, verbal intelligence, induction, deduction etc and that scores on these could be adduced by factor analysis from results on various tests, to give a single index known as the Intelligence Quotient (IQ). The pioneering statistical psychologist Spearman actually developed factor analysis in 1904 for his two-factor theory of intelligence, adding a formal technique to the science of psychometrics. In 1924 Thurstone looked for 56 factors of intelligence, developing the notion of Mental Age. Standard IQ tests today are based on this early work.

=== Residential differentiation ===
In 1949, Shevky and Williams introduced the theory of factorial ecology, which dominated studies of residential differentiation from the 1950s to the 1970s. Neighbourhoods in a city were recognizable or could be distinguished from one another by various characteristics which could be reduced to three by factor analysis. These were known as &#x27;social rank&#x27; (an index of occupational status), &#x27;familism&#x27; or family size, and &#x27;ethnicity&#x27;; Cluster analysis could then be applied to divide the city into clusters or precincts according to values of the three key factor variables. An extensive literature developed around factorial ecology in urban geography, but the approach went out of fashion after 1980 as being methodologically primitive and having little place in postmodern geographical paradigms.

One of the problems with factor analysis has always been finding convincing names for the various artificial factors. In 2000, Flood revived the factorial ecology approach to show that principal components analysis actually gave meaningful answers directly, without resorting to factor rotation. The principal components were actually dual variables or shadow prices of &#x27;forces&#x27; pushing people together or apart in cities. The first component was &#x27;accessibility&#x27;, the classic trade-off between demand for travel and demand for space, around which classical urban economics is based. The next two components were &#x27;disadvantage&#x27;, which keeps people of similar status in separate neighbourhoods (mediated by planning), and ethnicity, where people of similar ethnic backgrounds try to co-locate.

About the same time, the Australian Bureau of Statistics defined distinct indexes of advantage and disadvantage taking the first principal component of sets of key variables that were thought to be important. These SEIFA indexes are regularly published for various jurisdictions, and are used frequently in spatial analysis.

=== Development indexes ===
PCA can be used as a formal method for the development of indexes. As an alternative confirmatory composite analysis has been proposed to develop and assess indexes. 

The City Development Index was developed by PCA from about 200 indicators of city outcomes in a 1996 survey of 254 global cities. The first principal component was subject to iterative regression, adding the original variables singly until about 90% of its variation was accounted for. The index ultimately used about 15 indicators but was a good predictor of many more variables. Its comparative value agreed very well with a subjective assessment of the condition of each city. The coefficients on items of infrastructure were roughly proportional to the average costs of providing the underlying services, suggesting the Index was actually a measure of effective physical and social investment in the city.

The country-level Human Development Index (HDI) from UNDP, which has been published since 1990 and is very extensively used in development studies, has very similar coefficients on similar indicators, strongly suggesting it was originally constructed using PCA.

=== Population genetics ===
In 1978 Cavalli-Sforza and others pioneered the use of principal components analysis (PCA) to summarise data on variation in human gene frequencies across regions. The components showed distinctive patterns, including gradients and sinusoidal waves. They interpreted these patterns as resulting from specific ancient migration events.

Since then, PCA has been ubiquitous in population genetics, with thousands of papers using PCA as a display mechanism. Genetics varies largely according to proximity, so the first two principal components actually show spatial distribution and may be used to map the relative geographical location of different population groups, thereby showing individuals who have wandered from their original locations.

PCA in genetics has been technically controversial, in that the technique has been performed on discrete non-normal variables and often on binary allele markers. The lack of any measures of standard error in PCA are also an impediment to more consistent usage. In August 2022, the molecular biologist Eran Elhaik published a theoretical paper in Scientific Reports analyzing 12 PCA applications. He concluded that it was easy to manipulate the method, which, in his view, generated results that were &#x27;erroneous, contradictory, and absurd.&#x27; Specifically, he argued, the results achieved in population genetics were characterized by cherry-picking and circular reasoning.

=== Market research and indexes of attitude ===
Market research has been an extensive user of PCA. It is used to develop customer satisfaction or customer loyalty scores for products, and with clustering, to develop market segments that may be targeted with advertising campaigns, in much the same way as factorial ecology will locate geographical areas with similar characteristics.

PCA rapidly transforms large amounts of data into smaller, easier-to-digest variables that can be more rapidly and readily analyzed. In any consumer questionnaire, there are series of questions designed to elicit consumer attitudes, and principal components seek out latent variables underlying these attitudes. For example, the Oxford Internet Survey in 2013 asked 2000 people about their attitudes and beliefs, and from these analysts extracted four principal component dimensions, which they identified as &#x27;escape&#x27;, &#x27;social networking&#x27;, &#x27;efficiency&#x27;, and &#x27;problem creating&#x27;.

Another example from Joe Flood in 2008 extracted an attitudinal index toward housing from 28 attitude questions in a national survey of 2697 households in Australia. The first principal component represented a general attitude toward property and home ownership. The index, or the attitude questions it embodied, could be fed into a General Linear Model of tenure choice. The strongest determinant of private renting by far was the attitude index, rather than income, marital status or household type.

=== Quantitative finance ===
In quantitative finance, PCA is used
in financial risk management, and has been applied to other problems such as portfolio optimization.

PCA is commonly used in problems involving fixed income securities and portfolios, and interest rate derivatives. 
Valuations here depend on the entire yield curve, comprising numerous highly correlated instruments, and PCA is used to define a set of components or factors that explain rate movements,
thereby facilitating the modelling.
One common risk management application is to calculating value at risk, VaR, applying PCA to the Monte Carlo simulation.

Here, for each simulation-sample, the components are stressed, and rates, and in turn option values, are then reconstructed; 
with VaR calculated, finally, over the entire run. 
PCA is also used in hedging exposure to interest rate risk, given partial durations and other sensitivities.

Under both, the first three, typically, principal components of the system are of interest (representing &quot;shift&quot;, &quot;twist&quot;, and &quot;curvature&quot;).
These principal components are derived from an eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of yield at predefined maturities; 

and where the variance of each component is its eigenvalue (and as the components are orthogonal, no correlation need be incorporated in subsequent modelling).

For equity, an optimal portfolio is one where the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk, or alternatively, where risk is minimized for a given return; see Markowitz model for discussion.
Thus, one approach is to reduce portfolio risk, where allocation strategies are applied to the &quot;principal portfolios&quot; instead of the underlying stocks.
A second approach is to enhance portfolio return, using the principal components to select companies&#x27; stocks with upside potential.

PCA has also been used to understand relationships between international equity markets, and within markets between groups of companies in industries or sectors.

PCA may also be applied to stress testing, essentially an analysis of a bank&#x27;s ability to endure a hypothetical adverse economic scenario. Its utility is in &quot;distilling the information contained in [several] macroeconomic variables into a more manageable data set, which can then [be used] for analysis.&quot; Here, the resulting factors are linked to e.g. interest rates – based on the largest elements of the factor&#x27;s eigenvector – and it is then observed how a &quot;shock&quot; to each of the factors affects the implied assets of each of the banks.

=== Neuroscience ===
A variant of principal components analysis is used in neuroscience to identify the specific properties of a stimulus that increases a neuron&#x27;s probability of generating an action potential. This technique is known as spike-triggered covariance analysis. In a typical application an experimenter presents a white noise process as a stimulus (usually either as a sensory input to a test subject, or as a current injected directly into the neuron) and records a train of action potentials, or spikes, produced by the neuron as a result. Presumably, certain features of the stimulus make the neuron more likely to spike. In order to extract these features, the experimenter calculates the covariance matrix of the &quot;spike-triggered ensemble&quot;, the set of all stimuli (defined and discretized over a finite time window, typically on the order of 100 ms) that immediately preceded a spike. The eigenvectors of the difference between the spike-triggered covariance matrix and the covariance matrix of the &quot;prior stimulus ensemble&quot; (the set of all stimuli, defined over the same length time window) then indicate the directions in the space of stimuli along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble differed the most from that of the prior stimulus ensemble. Specifically, the eigenvectors with the largest positive eigenvalues correspond to the directions along which the variance of the spike-triggered ensemble showed the largest positive change compared to the variance of the prior. Since these were the directions in which varying the stimulus led to a spike, they are often good approximations of the sought after relevant stimulus features.

In neuroscience, PCA is also used to discern the identity of a neuron from the shape of its action potential. Spike sorting is an important procedure because extracellular recording techniques often pick up signals from more than one neuron. In spike sorting, one first uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the space of action potential waveforms, and then performs clustering analysis to associate specific action potentials with individual neurons.

PCA as a dimension reduction technique is particularly suited to detect coordinated activities of large neuronal ensembles. It has been used in determining collective variables, that is, order parameters, during phase transitions in the brain.

== Relation with other methods ==

=== Correspondence analysis ===

Correspondence analysis (CA)
was developed by Jean-Paul Benzécri
and is conceptually similar to PCA, but scales the data (which should be non-negative) so that rows and columns are treated equivalently. It is traditionally applied to contingency tables.
CA decomposes the chi-squared statistic associated to this table into orthogonal factors.
Because CA is a descriptive technique, it can be applied to tables for which the chi-squared statistic is appropriate or not.
Several variants of CA are available including detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis. One special extension is multiple correspondence analysis, which may be seen as the counterpart of principal component analysis for categorical data.

=== Factor analysis ===

Principal component analysis creates variables that are linear combinations of the original variables. The new variables have the property that the variables are all orthogonal. The PCA transformation can be helpful as a pre-processing step before clustering. PCA is a variance-focused approach seeking to reproduce the total variable variance, in which components reflect both common and unique variance of the variable. PCA is generally preferred for purposes of data reduction (that is, translating variable space into optimal factor space) but not when the goal is to detect the latent construct or factors.

Factor analysis is similar to principal component analysis, in that factor analysis also involves linear combinations of variables. Different from PCA, factor analysis is a correlation-focused approach seeking to reproduce the inter-correlations among variables, in which the factors &quot;represent the common variance of variables, excluding unique variance&quot;. In terms of the correlation matrix, this corresponds with focusing on explaining the off-diagonal terms (that is, shared co-variance), while PCA focuses on explaining the terms that sit on the diagonal. However, as a side result, when trying to reproduce the on-diagonal terms, PCA also tends to fit relatively well the off-diagonal correlations. Results given by PCA and factor analysis are very similar in most situations, but this is not always the case, and there are some problems where the results are significantly different. Factor analysis is generally used when the research purpose is detecting data structure (that is, latent constructs or factors) or causal modeling. If the factor model is incorrectly formulated or the assumptions are not met, then factor analysis will give erroneous results.

=== -means clustering ===
It has been asserted that the relaxed solution of -means clustering, specified by the cluster indicators, is given by the principal components, and the PCA subspace spanned by the principal directions is identical to the cluster centroid subspace. However, that PCA is a useful relaxation of -means clustering was not a new result, and it is straightforward to uncover counterexamples to the statement that the cluster centroid subspace is spanned by the principal directions.

=== Non-negative matrix factorization ===
 Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a dimension reduction method where only non-negative elements in the matrices are used, which is therefore a promising method in astronomy, in the sense that astrophysical signals are non-negative. The PCA components are orthogonal to each other, while the NMF components are all non-negative and therefore constructs a non-orthogonal basis.

In PCA, the contribution of each component is ranked based on the magnitude of its corresponding eigenvalue, which is equivalent to the fractional residual variance (FRV) in analyzing empirical data. For NMF, its components are ranked based only on the empirical FRV curves. The residual fractional eigenvalue plots, that is, formula_93 as a function of component number formula_66 given a total of formula_95 components, for PCA have a flat plateau, where no data is captured to remove the quasi-static noise, then the curves drop quickly as an indication of over-fitting (random noise). The FRV curves for NMF is decreasing continuously when the NMF components are constructed sequentially, indicating the continuous capturing of quasi-static noise; then converge to higher levels than PCA, indicating the less over-fitting property of NMF.

=== Iconography of correlations ===
It is often difficult to interpret the principal components when the data include many variables of various origins, or when some variables are qualitative. This leads the PCA user to a delicate elimination of several variables. If observations or variables have an excessive impact on the direction of the axes, they should be removed and then projected as supplementary elements. In addition, it is necessary to avoid interpreting the proximities between the points close to the center of the factorial plane.
The iconography of correlations, on the contrary, which is not a projection on a system of axes, does not have these drawbacks. We can therefore keep all the variables.

The principle of the diagram is to underline the &quot;remarkable&quot; correlations of the correlation matrix, by a solid line (positive correlation) or dotted line (negative correlation).

A strong correlation is not &quot;remarkable&quot; if it is not direct, but caused by the effect of a third variable. Conversely, weak correlations can be &quot;remarkable&quot;. For example, if a variable Y depends on several independent variables, the correlations of Y with each of them are weak and yet &quot;remarkable&quot;.

== Generalizations ==

=== Sparse PCA ===

A particular disadvantage of PCA is that the principal components are usually linear combinations of all input variables. Sparse PCA overcomes this disadvantage by finding linear combinations that contain just a few input variables. It extends the classic method of principal component analysis (PCA) for the reduction of dimensionality of data by adding sparsity constraint on the input variables.
Several approaches have been proposed, including
* a regression framework,
* a convex relaxation/semidefinite programming framework,
* a generalized power method framework
* an alternating maximization framework
* forward-backward greedy search and exact methods using branch-and-bound techniques,
* Bayesian formulation framework.
The methodological and theoretical developments of Sparse PCA as well as its applications in scientific studies were recently reviewed in a survey paper.

=== Nonlinear PCA ===
Most of the modern methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction find their theoretical and algorithmic roots in PCA or K-means. Pearson&#x27;s original idea was to take a straight line (or plane) which will be &quot;the best fit&quot; to a set of data points. Trevor Hastie expanded on this concept by proposing Principal curves as the natural extension for the geometric interpretation of PCA, which explicitly constructs a manifold for data approximation followed by projecting the points onto it. See also the elastic map algorithm and principal geodesic analysis. Another popular generalization is kernel PCA, which corresponds to PCA performed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with a positive definite kernel.

In multilinear subspace learning, PCA is generalized to multilinear PCA (MPCA) that extracts features directly from tensor representations. MPCA is solved by performing PCA in each mode of the tensor iteratively. MPCA has been applied to face recognition, gait recognition, etc. MPCA is further extended to uncorrelated MPCA, non-negative MPCA and robust MPCA.

&quot;N&quot;-way principal component analysis may be performed with models such as Tucker decomposition, PARAFAC, multiple factor analysis, co-inertia analysis, STATIS, and DISTATIS.

=== Robust PCA ===
While PCA finds the mathematically optimal method (as in minimizing the squared error), it is still sensitive to outliers in the data that produce large errors, something that the method tries to avoid in the first place. It is therefore common practice to remove outliers before computing PCA. However, in some contexts, outliers can be difficult to identify.
For example, in data mining algorithms like correlation clustering, the assignment of points to clusters and outliers is not known beforehand.
A recently proposed generalization of PCA based on a weighted PCA increases robustness by assigning different weights to data objects based on their estimated relevancy.

Outlier-resistant variants of PCA have also been proposed, based on L1-norm formulations (L1-PCA).

Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) via decomposition in low-rank and sparse matrices is a modification of PCA that works well with respect to grossly corrupted observations.

== Similar techniques ==

=== Independent component analysis ===
Independent component analysis (ICA) is directed to similar problems as principal component analysis, but finds additively separable components rather than successive approximations.

=== Network component analysis ===
Given a matrix formula_96, it tries to decompose it into two matrices such that formula_97. A key difference from techniques such as PCA and ICA is that some of the entries of formula_98 are constrained to be 0. Here formula_88 is termed the regulatory layer. While in general such a decomposition can have multiple solutions, they prove that if the following conditions are satisfied :
# formula_98 has full column rank
# Each column of formula_98 must have at least formula_102 zeroes where formula_103 is the number of columns of formula_98 (or alternatively the number of rows of formula_88). The justification for this criterion is that if a node is removed from the regulatory layer along with all the output nodes connected to it, the result must still be characterized by a connectivity matrix with full column rank.
# formula_88 must have full row rank.
then the decomposition is unique up to multiplication by a scalar.

=== Discriminant analysis of principal components ===

Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) is a multivariate method used to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. Genetic variation is partitioned into two components: variation between groups and within groups, and it maximizes the former. Linear discriminants are linear combinations of alleles which best separate the clusters. Alleles that most contribute to this discrimination are therefore those that are the most markedly different across groups. The contributions of alleles to the groupings identified by DAPC can allow identifying regions of the genome driving the genetic divergence among groups
In DAPC, data is first transformed using a principal components analysis (PCA) and subsequently clusters are identified using discriminant analysis (DA).

A DAPC can be realized on R using the package Adegenet. (more info: adegenet on the web)

=== Directional component analysis ===

Directional component analysis (DCA) is a method used in the atmospheric sciences for analysing multivariate datasets.
Like PCA, it allows for dimension reduction, improved visualization and improved interpretability of large data-sets.
Also like PCA, it is based on a covariance matrix derived from the input dataset.
The difference between PCA and DCA is that DCA additionally requires the input of a vector direction, referred to as the impact. 
Whereas PCA maximises explained variance, DCA maximises probability density given impact.
The motivation for DCA is to find components of a multivariate dataset that are both likely (measured using probability density) and important (measured using the impact).
DCA has been used to find the most likely and most serious heat-wave patterns in weather prediction ensembles
, and the most likely and most impactful changes in rainfall due to climate change

<doc id="76341" wikidata="Q1535980" url="?curid=76341" title="Shadows (1959 film)">
<text>Shadows is a 1959 American independent drama film directed by John Cassavetes about race relations during the Beat Generation years in New York City. The film stars Ben Carruthers, Lelia Goldoni, and Hugh Hurd as three black siblings, though only one of them is dark-skinned enough to be considered African American. The film was initially shot in 1957 and shown in 1958, but a poor reception prompted Cassavetes to rework it in 1959. Promoted as a completely improvisational film, it was intensively rehearsed in 1957, and in 1959 it was fully scripted.

The film depicts two weeks in the lives of three siblings on the margins of society: two brothers who are struggling jazz musicians and their light-skinned younger sister who goes through three relationships, one with an older white writer, one with a shallow white lover, and finally one with a gentle young black admirer.

Film scholars consider &quot;Shadows&quot; a milestone of American independent cinema. In 1960, the film won the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival.

In 1993, &quot;Shadows&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. 

==Plot==
Light-skinned Ben, diffident and awkward, wants to be a jazz trumpeter, but spends most of his time drinking in Manhattan bars and trying to pick up girls with two fellow-idlers, Dennis and Tom. He is supported by his darker-skinned brother Hugh, a jazz singer who is unable to find much work because of his old-fashioned vocal style. Hugh&#x27;s career is managed by Rupert.

Ben and Hugh live with their fair-skinned younger sister Lelia, who wants to be an artist. Recently, she has been under the wing of an older boyfriend, the intellectual David, who encourages her to write and attempts to be helpfully critical of her efforts. At a party, Lelia abandons David for a younger man, Tony, who coaxes her back to his apartment. Tony professes his love for Lelia, and, despite her apparent apprehension, he takes her virginity. Afterward, she is filled with ambivalence and regret about Tony and about her first sexual encounter, but they agree to continue dating. Seeing her home, he is shocked to discover that her family is black. Sensing his racial animosity, Hugh kicks Tony out of the apartment, as he does not want his sister dating a perceived bigot.

Hugh has some guests over, and a friend urges Lelia to flirt with a gentlemanly black man named Davey. She is distant and contrary, but she and Davey arrange to go on a date. When Davey comes to pick Lelia up, she makes him wait for hours while she gets ready. As they are walking out the door, Tony arrives. He is disappointed to see her already dating another man, and she exits past him without a word. Hugh and Tony nearly come to blows, but Ben intervenes and listens to an apologetic message that he promises to relay to Lelia, though, after Tony leaves, Ben laughs at Tony with Hugh and Rupert. Lelia and Davey go dancing, and she continues to be rude, but softens after Davey asserts himself.

At the train station, Rupert informs Hugh that one of the two bookings of Hugh&#x27;s upcoming tour has been canceled. He vents his frustration about their state of affairs, and, for once, it is Hugh who says some encouraging words to lift Rupert&#x27;s spirits, instead of the other way around. Smiling, the friends get on the train for a week&#x27;s billing in Chicago.

Ben, Dennis, and Tom drunkenly clown around with some girls in a bar. When the girls&#x27; tough male dates come out of the bathroom, tensions flare, and the two sides take their argument outside, where Ben, Dennis and Tom are badly beaten up. Over a drink, Ben tells his friends that he is tired of their way of living. Tom heads home, and, while Dennis goes to buy some cigarettes, Ben wanders off alone down the nighttime New York City streets.

==Production==
The idea for the film came from a classroom exercise. With acting coach Burt Lane (later the father of Diane Lane), Cassavetes was conducting classes for aspiring actors at the off-Broadway Variety Arts Theatre in Manhattan&#x27;s Union Square neighborhood. The classes, listed as &quot;The Cassavetes-Lane Drama Workshop&quot;, were Cassavetes&#x27; attempt to counter method acting, which was ascendant in New York theatre and film. A particular exercise became the core of the film: A young African-American woman who was very light-skinned dated a young white man, but he was repulsed when he discovered she had a black brother. Cassavetes determined to put the scene on film, so he began looking for funding. While ostensibly promoting the film &quot;Edge of the City&quot; on Jean Shepherd&#x27;s &quot;Night People&quot; radio show on WOR in February 1957, Cassavetes said he could make a better film than could director Martin Ritt. He pitched the drama workshop idea to Shepherd&#x27;s radio audience. Cassavetes was surprised when listeners sent about $2,000 to start the project. Money also came from Cassavetes&#x27; friends, including Hedda Hopper, William Wyler, Joshua Logan, Robert Rossen, José Quintero, and Cassavetes&#x27; agent Charlie Feldman. Cassavetes hired German cinematographer Erich Kollmar as cameraman, the only crew member except Cassavetes with any experience in film.

Using student actors from the Cassavetes-Lane Drama Workshop, shooting started in February 1957 in a largely improvised form. Cassavetes composed an outline for the film, but not a script. Cassavetes and assistant director/producer Maurice McEndree gave detailed instructions to the actors, constraining the situation to guide the story, with the words and the movements improvised by the actors. Cassavetes intended the story to evolve from the characters rather than vice versa. Three initial weeks of work was thrown out, the first week because of technical problems with quality, and the next two weeks because Cassavetes felt that the actors were talking too much. After they had developed their characters to the point at which they could portray emotion in silence, the actors improvised with more clarity and with a level of truth that Cassavetes found revealing. He was a demanding director who required a critical romantic scene to be performed more than 50 times before he was satisfied with the results. About 30 hours of film was exposed during several months of off-and-on shooting.

Filming took place in various locations, including inside the apartment that Cassavetes shared with his wife Gena Rowlands, and on the streets of New York. Using a 16 mm camera borrowed from Shirley Clarke, and monochrome film stock, Kollmar was forced to shoot scenes in which the actors could move in any direction they wished, making for unpredictable zoom and focus requirements. No filming permits were obtained, so the cast and crew were necessarily ready to pack quickly and leave a location. The lighting was a general wash rather than specific effects. The microphone was placed by Jay Crecco (who was also an actor in the film), and dialogue was recorded to tape with street noises intruding. Even though Cassavetes said &quot;print it!&quot; after he was satisfied with a scene, there was nobody on the crew keeping track of the film takes, so all of the exposed film had to be printed. The editing of the film was made much more difficult by the lack of notes taken during shooting, and by the sound recorded &quot;wild&quot; on tape, not synchronized with the film. The microphone failed to pick up some of the dialogue, requiring lip-readers to watch the footage and write down what had been said so that the actors could re-record their dialogue. Editors Len Appelson, Maurice McEndree and Wray Bevins began work while shooting was still under way, editing the film in an office next door to the Variety Arts Theatre, the office that is seen hosting a rock &#x27;n roll party in the film. Primary photography was finished by mid-May 1957, with of film exposed, but the editing took more than a year. Cassavetes was not available during much of this time; starting in June, he was on location working as an actor first in &quot;Saddle the Wind&quot;, then in &quot;Virgin Island&quot; (both 1958). At the end of 1957, the editors moved to a professional editing suite to complete the task.

Cassavetes intended to have the jazz music of Charles Mingus on the soundtrack, but Mingus composed a number of songs that could stand on their own rather than impressionistic film music to follow the story. Three hours of Mingus and his band were recorded, and much of this material was placed in the first version of &quot;Shadows&quot;, screened in 1958, but almost all of it was removed during the 1959 reworking of the film. Two of Mingus&#x27; compositions for the film were subsequently included on the 1959 album &quot;Jazz Portraits: Mingus in Wonderland&quot;.

==1958 screening==
The film was finished late in 1958, printed onto 16 mm stock, and three free screenings were announced by Shepherd on his radio show. Cassavetes overestimated the audience; only about 100 people showed up for each of the midnight showings at Manhattan&#x27;s Paris Theater, which could hold almost 600 people. At the first showing, there were initial problems with the sound, which were remedied. Some of the audience members were friends and colleagues of Cassavetes; he later said that 90% of them disliked the film. A number of people walked out before the film ended, including Burt Lane, who had coached most of the cast. Assistant cameraman Al Ruban told Cassavetes that the film was &quot;okay in a kind of naive way&quot;. Cassavetes&#x27; father told him it was a &quot;pure&quot; film, not a good film. Cassavetes thought it was &quot;totally intellectual&quot; and thus &quot;less than human&quot;. The poor reception made him decide that the film should be radically reworked.

However, avant-garde film critic Jonas Mekas highly praised the film, writing in the January 1959 issue of &quot;Film Culture&quot; that &quot;Shadows&quot; &quot;presents contemporary reality in a fresh and unconventional manner... The improvisation, spontaneity, and free inspiration that are almost entirely lost in most films from an excess of professionalism are fully used in this film.&quot; The magazine, founded by Mekas and his brother, bestowed upon &quot;Shadows&quot; its first &quot;Independent Film Award&quot;. Mekas then arranged to have the film shown six more times at the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association.

==1959 reworking==
Cassavetes shot new scenes in 1959 using a script that he co-wrote with Robert Alan Aurthur. The racial prejudice angle was reduced, and the three main characters were given more complications, as well as more time exploring their connectedness. With financing from Nikos Papatakis and others, Cassavetes reassembled the required members of the cast and crew. Half to two-thirds of the original footage was replaced, which angered those whose work was diminished. A 16 mm print was struck, and the new version was shown on November 11, 1959, at Amos Vogel&#x27;s avant-garde Cinema 16, on a double bill with the 30-minute beat poetry film &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot;.

The first version was an ensemble performance, while the second version put more emphasis on Lelia. The revelation that she was African-American came much earlier in the second version. The first version had more of a conventional narrative, but its pace was slow in sections. It also contained a number of technical flaws, such as lip-sync errors. Lelia&#x27;s date with Tony was greatly altered: in the first version, she only talks with him, but in the second version, she loses her virginity to him. The first version had more scenes of Ben and his friends hanging around Times Square. Actor Anthony Ray, the son of famous director Nicholas Ray, had top billing in the first version, playing the part of Lelia&#x27;s date Tony, but in the second version, this billing was reduced to reflect his diminished screen time. His character was given greater dignity in the second version.

A major difference between the two versions was that Mingus&#x27; music was featured more in the first version, but the music was incongruously paired with the visuals, according to film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum. For the second version, Cassavetes replaced almost all of the Mingus recordings. For example, he removed a section in which a muted trumpet replaces the speech of character Tony on the phone, the sound mocking him. Another removed part involves the Mingus band shouting out a snatch of the gospel song &quot;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&quot; during a scene in which Ben and his friends are recovering from a brutal fight. The first version also uses two Frank Sinatra songs that are not in the second version because Cassavetes could not obtain the rights. Mingus&#x27;s saxophonist Shafi Hadi, previously known as Curtis Porter, provided most of the second version&#x27;s soundtrack, expanding on a short passage that Mingus had written. Hadi was directed in his improvisation by Cassavetes, who acted out all the parts for him in the recording studio.

Another difference between the versions is that Ben&#x27;s statement &quot;I&#x27;ve learned a lesson&quot; comes at the end of the second version, conveying to the viewer that Ben will improve himself after receiving such a cruel beating. This brings a sense of moral closure to the film. In the first version, the fight and Ben&#x27;s statement appear halfway through the film, following which he is shown doing the same things again, having failed to learn his lesson. Thus, Ben is portrayed as unlikely ever to change his ways in the first version.

==Reception==
In his December 1959 manifesto &quot;A Call for a New Generation of Film Makers&quot;, Mekas said that &quot;Shadows&quot; was the start of a new movement that would inspire independent filmmakers, energize the flagging avant-garde film scene, and triumph over the commercial Hollywood film industry. Even so, he was upset that the film had been reworked. In January 1960, he wrote in his movie-review column in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that the 1959 version was commercialized, &quot;just another Hollywood film&quot;, and that everything he had praised in the first version had been &quot;completely destroyed&quot;. Later in his life, he said that the first version should have never been remade, but that the second version was a better indication of the direction in which Cassavetes was going as a filmmaker.

&quot;Shadows&quot; was given the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival. Cassavetes obtained distribution through British Lion in 1961.

==Legacy==
The film was shocking to American audiences in the late 1950s and early 1960s because it turned the &quot;concept of race upside down&quot;. Two of the principal actors portraying African-Americans were not actually black: Goldoni was born in the U.S. to Sicilian parents, fully European in heritage, and Carruthers was only one-sixteenth black. Carruthers used a sunlamp to darken his skin during the 1957 shooting of the film, but in 1959 for the new scenes, he abandoned this effort. Carruthers and Goldoni were married in 1960, but quickly divorced.

After &quot;Shadows&quot; was honored by the Venice Film Festival, the international publicity helped it become the first American film to see success outside of the Hollywood system. It joined &quot;Pull My Daisy&quot; and Shirley Clarke&#x27;s &quot;The Connection&quot; to establish a new wave of American independent films.

In 1994, film critic Leonard Maltin said the film &quot;was considered a watershed in the birth of American independent cinema&quot;.

===2003 rediscovery===
The second version of the film, the result of the reshooting and reworking Cassavetes did in 1959, is the one that Cassavetes considered to be the final product, and he refused to show the 1958 version. In time, he lost track of the first version&#x27;s only print, and for decades it was believed to have been lost or destroyed. In the 1980s, Cassavetes said he may have donated the film to a school far away. In fact, the 16 mm print of the first version had been left on a New York City subway train, taken to the subway&#x27;s lost-and-found department, and then purchased by a second-hand-goods shop owner as part of a box of unclaimed items. The shop owner saw &quot;Shadows&quot; scratched into the leader on the first reel, but he did not recognize the film&#x27;s name. The shop eventually went out of business, and the owner retired. The reels of film were stored in an attic in Florida, and, in November 2003, they were given by the shop owner&#x27;s daughter to film professor Ray Carney, who had been searching for the print of the first version of &quot;Shadows&quot; since the 1980s. A digital copy was shown at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in late January 2004. Since then, few people have seen this version, as Rowlands and the Cassavetes estate have been involved in a legal dispute regarding Carney&#x27;s use of the film.

<doc id="76345" wikidata="Q596260" url="?curid=76345" title="Shaft (1971 film)">
<text>Shaft is a 1971 American blaxploitation crime action thriller film directed by Gordon Parks and written by Ernest Tidyman and John D. F. Black. It is an adaptation of Tidyman&#x27;s novel of the same name and is the first entry in the &quot;Shaft&quot; film series. The plot revolves around a private detective named John Shaft who is hired by a Harlem mobster to rescue his daughter from the Italian mobsters who kidnapped her. The film stars Richard Roundtree as Shaft, alongside Moses Gunn, Charles Cioffi, Christopher St. John, and Lawrence Pressman.

The film explores themes including masculinity and sexuality, with a specific emphasis on Black Power. It was filmed in Harlem, Greenwich Village, and Times Square within the Manhattan borough of New York City. The &quot;Shaft&quot; soundtrack album, recorded by Isaac Hayes, was also a success, winning a Grammy Award for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture and a second Grammy (shared with Johnny Allen) for Best Instrumental Arrangement. The &quot;Theme from &quot;Shaft&quot;&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making Hayes the first Black man to win the award for that category. The song has appeared on multiple Top 100 lists, including AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs.

A prime example of the blaxploitation genre, it was selected in 2000 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; &quot;Shaft&quot; initially had two sequels called &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score!&quot; (1972) and &quot;Shaft in Africa&quot; (1973), though neither enjoyed the critical success of the original.

==Plot==
In January 1971, private detective John Shaft is informed that some gangsters are looking for him. He spots one of the men waiting for him in his office building and ambushes him. At gunpoint, he brings him to his office, where the second gangster is already waiting. During a short fight, Shaft dodges one of them, who falls out of a window. The other one reveals that Bumpy Jonas, the leader of a Harlem-based organized crime family, wants Shaft brought uptown to Harlem for a meeting. At the police station, Lieutenant Vic Androzzi and a detective question Shaft about the gangster&#x27;s death, which Shaft calls an &quot;accident&quot;. Androzzi allows Shaft to return to the streets for 48 hours to gather more information. Shaft meets with Bumpy, who tearfully reveals that his daughter has been kidnapped. Shaft is at first dismissive, accusing her of being a runaway or on drugs, until Jonas says she was on her way to college when she got abducted. He asks Shaft to ensure her safe return, and Shaft agrees to help. Bumpy advises that Shaft should seek out Ben Buford, a black militant leader.

Shaft tracks down Buford, and a shootout ensues with an unknown assailant. Afterward, Shaft is told by Androzzi that Shaft, not Ben, was the target, and that tensions brewing between the uptown hoods belonging to Bumpy Jonas and the downtown Mafiosi have culminated in other murders. Androzzi laments that the issue is seen as black-against-white to the general public and worries about the escalation into a full-blown race war. He also shows Shaft some pictures of Mafia men who just arrived in New York. Shaft and Ben meet with Bumpy and accuse him of setting up the shootout. After Bumpy agrees to pay $10,000 for each of Ben&#x27;s men who died, Ben and Shaft join forces to find Bumpy&#x27;s daughter.

Later, Shaft surmises that mobsters are watching his apartment from a local bar. Shaft pretends to be a bartender and calls Androzzi to have the mobsters arrested. Shaft then confronts the arrested mobsters about Bumpy&#x27;s daughter, and he sets up a meeting. When he gets home, Vic arrives and tells Shaft that the room at the station house was bugged and his superior wants to bring Shaft in for questioning regarding the kidnapping. Instead of taking him in, Androzzi leaves. Shaft is escorted by a Mafia member to the apartment where Marcy Jonas is being held, and Ben and two of his men tail them. Once there, a shootout ensues: two Mafia men are killed, and Shaft takes a bullet in the shoulder. After receiving medical attention, Shaft tells Ben to round up his men and meet him at the hotel where Marcy has been taken. He calls Bumpy to tell him his daughter is fine, but that he needs taxicabs at the hotel for the getaway.

At the hotel, Shaft, Ben, and Ben&#x27;s men dress as hotel workers and slowly infiltrate the hotel. Shaft gets to the roof of the hotel, and swings into the room where Marcy is kept. He kills the gangster guarding her and brings her outside. Meanwhile, Ben and his men kill the gangsters in the surrounding rooms, and exit. After the taxicabs take Marcy, Ben, and Ben&#x27;s men away, Shaft calls Androzzi from a phone booth, telling him that his case has just busted open. Androzzi asks him to close it, and Shaft replies, in reference to an earlier scene, &quot;You&#x27;re gonna have to close it yourself, shitty!&quot;, then hangs up the phone and walks away laughing.

&quot;Shaft&quot; was adapted from Ernest Tidyman&#x27;s novels by Tidyman and screenwriter John D. F. Black. Joel Freeman and executive producers Stirling Silliphant and Roger Lewis produced the film.

The screen detective genre in the late 1960s had been dominated by the big movies, big stars. Paul Newman had established his Harper in 1966, (the character reprised 1975, in &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot;). Soon following, Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Tony Rome&quot; (1967), &quot;The Detective&quot; (1968), and &quot;Lady in Cement&quot; (1968) further set the quality. Industry knowledge suggested that the first of the Clint Eastwood &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; productions was also slated for a 1971 release. Gordon Parks&#x27;s directorial debut of a major entertainment production was set on a course for an appreciation of comparisons. The instinctive cultural polymath knew where a coup of casting was his by necessity to play.

Although black in the source novel, Tidyman&#x27;s original draft screenplay had Shaft as white. However, [Gordon] Parks cast African American actor Richard Roundtree as the eponymous hero. The entire dynamic of the film, its later success, and the future of blaxploitation films were all greatly impacted by Parks&#x27; decision. This film was created less to impact black consciousness and more to simply to show a fun film&#x27;, which people could attend on Saturday night and see a black guy winning.&quot; Nevertheless, Parks said in the documentary about his work, &quot;Half Past Autumn&quot; (2000), that he had hoped the film would inspire young African Americans by presenting them with &quot;a hero they hadn&#x27;t had before.&quot; &quot;Shaft&quot; was intentionally created to &quot;appeal to a black urban audience, along with contiguous white youths.&quot;

After production, in an effort to entice a large black audience to see the film, MGM hired UniWorld, a black advertising firm, who &quot;popularized &quot;Shaft&quot; by using the rhetoric of black power.&quot; Although this film was notable for its crossover success with both white and black audiences, UniWorld focused largely on attracting members of the African-American community. &quot;For example, &quot;Variety&quot; reported UniWorld&#x27;s advertisement description of the protagonist John Shaft as, &#x27;A lone, black Superspade—a man of flair and flamboyance who has fun at the expense of the (white) establishment.&#x27;&quot; They also promoted the behind-the-camera participation of blacks&#x27;, thereby appealing to blacks who would appreciate the film as a black production or could fantasize that blacks had somehow beat the Hollywood system and taken over Metro-Goldwyn Mayer studios.&quot;

=== Roundtree&#x27;s view about being in the film ===
When asked at the 2014 Virginia Film Festival how it felt to be cast as Shaft, Richard Roundtree responded that he had been extremely excited about the part at the time. He had previously been cast mostly in commercials, and this role, his first in a feature film, was a big break for him.

=== Production ===

Melvin Van Peebles claimed that the success of his film &quot;Sweet Sweetback&#x27;s Baadasssss Song&quot; caused &quot;Shaft&quot; to be changed from a &quot;white movie&quot; into a &quot;black one&quot;. In fact, filming of &quot;Shaft&quot; began in January 1971, several months before the release of Van Peebles&#x27; film, with Roundtree already confirmed in the lead role. The story is set in the same month, as shown by a calendar on Shaft&#x27;s office wall.

Tidyman, who is white, was an editor at &quot;The New York Times&quot; prior to becoming a novelist. He sold the movie rights to &quot;Shaft&quot; by showing the galley proofs to the studio (the novel had not yet been published). Tidyman was honored by the NAACP for his work on the &quot;Shaft&quot; movies and books.

== Themes ==
=== Portrayal of race ===
&quot;Shaft&quot; played a crucial part in the development of African-American advancement in Hollywood.
In the creation of &quot;Shaft&quot;, there was a significant African-American presence, with director Parks, editor Hugh A. Robertson, and composer Isaac Hayes playing crucial roles. On the other hand, white men controlled the other important aspects of &quot;Shaft&quot;&#x27;s production. Scenarist and writer Tidyman, writer Black, producer Freeman, and executive producers Silliphant and Lewis were all white men who heavily influenced the making of &quot;Shaft&quot;. In an analysis of &quot;Shaft&quot;, Stanly Corkin stated, &quot;Further, the reception of the idea of blackness also becomes various, defined by any number of subject positions, and again, those cannot be fixed to any particular racially defined place of origin.&quot; In other words, the perception of race depends on the viewer and thus differs between individuals. Since different representations of race appeal to different people, the film&#x27;s white creators fabricated its representation of blackness in order to appeal to African American and white audiences alike. MGM was struggling financially during the making of this film, so making a profitable film was a necessity. &quot;Under the devious guise of providing the Black American with a new and positive image of his/her life, these films confer upon the viewer, Black or White, little more than a pretended glamour and sophistication, the empty, repetitive wasteland of ancient Hollywood traditionalism.&quot;

Parks&#x27; decision to cast Roundtree rather than a white actor, for whom the role was written, instantly altered the presentation of race in the film. Critics, however, believed the plot was not altered enough to accommodate the change in racial dynamics. &quot;Mark Reid, for example, argues that Shaft is a product of the (white) studio imagination and merely a &#x27;black-skinned replica&#x27; of the white action hero commonly found in the detective genre.&quot;

One way that Shaft&#x27;s blackness was showcased was through his attire. Shaft was &quot;stylistically racialized: [He] wears clothes and affects manners that are associated with being black&quot;. Shaft was known for his elegant garb, as he was frequently draped in leather coats and turtlenecks throughout the film. Although his smooth, classy look evoked a greater interest from viewers, it in no way represented fashion typical of the black community in that era.

Further, Shaft relies upon a group of militant black nationalists in helping him complete his mission to save Bumpy&#x27;s daughter. The inclusion of a group so strongly identified with the Black Power movement was clearly an effort to appeal to black audience members. However, the film presented the black nationalists as a group that failed to further the black cause, raised no awareness of the black struggle, and displayed them simply as a hired team of assailants to assist Shaft on his mission.

The filming of &quot;Shaft&quot; partly in the neighborhood of Harlem also allowed the black viewer to have a deeper connection to this film. The writers portrayed Shaft as a man who clearly had a good relationship with this neighborhood, yet rejected it once he became wealthy, moving to the predominantly white area of Greenwich Village. Traditional black thought in this era was that African Americans who had been prosperous financially should invest in and give back to the communities from which they came. Instead, &quot;the implication is that the wise black (Shaft) will want to sever ties with the people of Harlem and find a place among whites.&quot; This point further indicates the false portrayal of race in &quot;Shaft&quot;, as a true black action hero of his time period would have been more loyal to his neighborhood.

The result of this inauthentic portrayal of blackness in early 1970s blaxploitation films like &quot;Shaft&quot; had an effect on black audiences viewing them. Instead of the collective nature of the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movement in the 1960s, these films helped to usher in a decade of self-indulgence, material gain, and drug consumption. &quot;Equally important, Riley points out that the narratives about, and images of, blacks in these new films are no more than thematic templates reworked with black casts and updated stereotypes that reconfirm white expectations of blacks and serve to repress and delay the awakening of any real political consciousness.&quot;

=== Black power through masculinity ===

Although &quot;Shaft&quot; was a depiction of Blackness by white creators, the movie touched on several themes that reflected the ideals of the Black Power movement. Some of the actions taken by Shaft highlighted the positive aspects of this movement, while others brought out some of its less progressive facets.

A noticeable quality of Roundtree&#x27;s character was his commanding presence and the control that he displayed in almost every situation he faced throughout the film. In the Black Power movement, leaders ardently fought to gain greater presence and control for their people, because even after desegregation, African Americans were still greatly excluded from the economic, political, and cultural systems engrained in white American society. Shaft was depicted as a character that had achieved a high level of personal freedom, confidence, and control in his life, which was exciting for African American viewers. At the beginning of the film, Shaft was approached by two police officers seeking information. As the officers were depending upon his information, Shaft dictated the conversation from a position of power. Spatially, he also was much taller than the officers, further boosting his position of control. Shaft&#x27;s economic independence was a crucial part of his persona. Once bankrolled by Bumpy, Shaft was often seen giving money to others, which showed that he had substantial financial security. He also had a beautiful apartment located in Greenwich Village, where rent would have been expensive. The Black Power movement frequently stressed the importance of upward social mobility.

Another prominent characteristic of this movement was its strong focus on masculinity. This emphasis on the male effort to improve black life was accompanied by sexist beliefs by many leading activists. Their sexist views were felt to be a reaction to the hierarchical power structure already prevalent in society. Having been subjugated by white people for years, African-American men in turn treated women as beneath them. &quot;Robyn Wiegman argues that the members of the Black Power Movement defined the politics of race within &#x27;a metaphorics of phallic power,&#x27; which developed out of male activists&#x27; desire to counter cultural articulations of black male inferiority, and that this perspective is readily seen in the writings of influential figures such as Malcolm X, Huey Newton, Eldridge Cleaver, and Amiri Baraka.&quot;

Shaft directly embodied this ideal of extreme black masculinity through displays of hypersexuality and misogyny. &quot;Although Shaft lacked power in the racial sphere, by virtue of being a heterosexual male in a patriarchal system, he still maintains a semblance of power in relation to women.&quot; From the very beginning of the film, Shaft&#x27;s sexuality was highlighted as an important characteristic of his persona. In this scene, Shaft was parting ways with two white officers and one asks him, &quot;Where are you going?&quot; &quot;To get laid&quot;, Shaft replied. Shaft was described as a legendary &quot;sex machine&quot;, and this dominance over females was presented as an instrument of power. Shaft not only has ample sexual relationships with women, but he treats them with little respect. &quot;While he ha[d] a black girlfriend, which would satisfy the expectations of cultural nationalism, he is not above sleeping around and having random sex with attractive white women.&quot; In one scene, Shaft&#x27;s girlfriend told him that she loves him, and Shaft memorably responded with &quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; Also, after a white woman slept with Shaft, she told him, &quot;You&#x27;re pretty good in the sack, but you&#x27;re pretty shitty afterwards. You know that?&quot; This statement further highlights both Shaft&#x27;s sexual prowess and his misogynist actions.

== Context ==
The fifth blaxploitation film released, &quot;Shaft&quot; is one of the most popular films of the genre. Commenting on the film shortly after its release, &quot;New York Times&quot; movie critic Vincent Canby accurately predicted the wave of blaxploitation films to follow: &quot;How audiences react, however, has a great deal to do with the kind of movies that do get made, and having watched the extraordinary receptions given to both &quot;Sweet Sweetback&quot; and &quot;Shaft&quot; I&#x27;m led to wonder if, perhaps, the existence of what seems to be a large, hungry, Black movie audience—an audience whose experiences and interests are treated mostly in token fashion by TV—might not be one of the more healthy and exciting developments on the current movie scene.&quot; &quot;Shaft&quot; greatly impacted future blaxploitation films which &quot;crudely tried to emulate the success of &quot;Shaft&quot; and &quot;Sweetback&quot;, repeated, filled in, or exaggerated the ingredients of the Blaxploitation formula, which usually consisted of a pimp, gangster, or their baleful female counterparts, violently acting out a revenge or retribution motif against corrupt whites in the romanticized confines of the ghetto or inner city.&quot;

==Cultural impact==
Considered as &quot;the first Black action hero&quot;, Roundtree is credited with having an impact on the rise of African American leading actors in Hollywood projects, thanks to his successful performances in the Shaft franchise.

The way Richard Roundtree portrayed Shaft created a Black male style that was so distinct and pervasive it became known as “swag”. After Shaft the representation of Black masculinity in American films was dramatically changed. It became the norm to see black men in roles that before would have been filled by white men.

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
The film was one of only three profitable movies that year for MGM, grossing what &quot;Time&quot; magazine called an &quot;astonishing&quot; $13 million on a budget of $500,000.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said the film cost $1 million after advertising and other costs and grossed $4.5 million. According to &quot;Variety&quot; by 1976 it earned $7.656 million in theatrical rentals.

It not only spawned several years of &quot;blaxploitation&quot; action films, it earned enough money to save then-struggling MGM from bankruptcy.

=== Public reception ===
&quot;Shaft&quot; was extremely successful in theaters, which was a huge accomplishment for the then-struggling MGM studios. It was produced at a cost of $1.2 million while earning $10.8 million in its first year of distribution, $7 million in the U.S. alone.

===Critical reception===
The critical reception of &quot;Shaft&quot; was mixed. In general, the film was applauded for its innovation, success, and its lasting effect on the film industry. &quot;Because of the film&#x27;s positioning securely within the parameters of industry standards, &quot;Shaft&quot; was generally applauded by the critics both black and white, as being a breakthrough production in terms of expanding black representation in commercial cinema.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;The strength of Parks&#x27;s movie is his willingness to let his hero fully inhabit the private-eye genre, with all of its obligatory violence, blood, obscenity, and plot gimmicks. The weakness of &#x27;Shaft,&#x27; I suspect, is that Parks is not very eager to inhabit that world along with his hero.&quot; Gene Siskel awarded two stars out of four and wrote that the film &quot;offers little more than a rousing opening fight and a chance to see Roundtree glower while he models some fancy leather outfits.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;directed by Gordon Parks with a subtle feel for both the grit and the humanity of the script. Excellent cast, headed by newcomer Richard Roundtree, may shock some audiences with a heavy dose of candid dialog and situation.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the first good Saturday night movie I&#x27;ve seen in years ... &#x27;Shaft&#x27; is not a great film, but it&#x27;s very entertaining.&quot; In a review for &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, Nigel Andrews called it &quot;in the main a highly workmanlike and enjoyable thriller.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a diverting commercial thriller, inconsequential but slick and casually enjoyable.&quot;

Other critics like Clayton Riley mainly found fault in the films&#x27; failure to &quot;deal with Black life in serious terms,&quot; writing that &quot;Sam Spade is all right for the field hands because the White folks don&#x27;t want to carry that weight any more. But how seriously would &#x27;Five Easy Pieces&#x27; have been taken with a Black pianist as the weary protagonist?&quot; Riley also harshly stated, &quot;Mediocre is the only word to describe the work of Gordon Parks, the director of this nonsense, inept is the kindest thing to say about the performances of Richard Roundtree as John Shaft, a Black private eye on the prowl for kicks in the Big Apple underworld.&quot; Parks responded to Riley&#x27;s social criticisms with a letter to the editor in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stating that &quot;Riley seems sadly alone among blacks in this reaction. Most black critics have lauded the film for its portrayal of Shaft as a strong black hero ... I share Riley&#x27;s desire to see black actors playing roles now assumed by actors such as Jack Nicholson or Dustin Hoffman, but I don&#x27;t think the choice for black people is limited to either &#x27;Five Easy Pieces&#x27; or Stepin Fetchit.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 88% based on 49 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The website&#x27;s &quot;Critics Consensus&quot; quotes the movie&#x27;s opening song: &quot;This is the man that would risk his neck for his brother, man. Can you dig it?&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
In 2000, &quot;Shaft&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Shaft&quot; was chosen as one of &quot;The 1000 Best Movies Ever Made&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

One of the greatest factors contributing to &quot;Shaft&quot;&#x27;s wild success and lasting appeal is its memorable musical score, &quot;a revolutionary funk/soul masterpiece&quot;. Hayes auditioned for the role of Shaft but was asked to compose the musical score instead. &quot;Vulgar, shallow, and crudely done, &quot;Shaft&quot; distinguished itself mainly by having the best musical score of the year. Isaac Hayes&#x27;s sensual, moody background music added to the texture of the film…&quot;

Hayes&#x27; soundtrack was recognized for its unique and catchy sound. &quot;Instead of laying out a series of lengthy, chilled-out raps and jams, the episodic nature of a movie structure obliged him to focus on shorter instrumentals, featuring laid-back, jazz-infused riffs and solos.&quot; For example, from the &#x27;Theme from Shaft,&#x27; &quot;The instrumental section, played by the Bar Kays and Movement, deploys pulsating bass, stuttering wah-wah guitar, Hayes&#x27;s own distinctive piano playing, a descending four-note horn motif, ascending flute runs and the now famous Pearl and Dean-style blasts of brass and strings.&quot; &quot;Thirty five years on, &quot;Shaft&quot; may sound dated, but it&#x27;s a sound that inspired a generation of soul musicians. Hayes&#x27; laid back vocal delivery and the gorgeous arrangements by Johnny Allen are still breathtaking, and the album remains a quintessential slice of &#x27;70s soul.&quot;

The soundtrack received praise and awards. Only a few weeks after the release of the film, the soundtrack album had earned $2 million and had gone platinum. &quot;The &quot;Shaft&quot; theme became so popular that it was heard everywhere, from nightclubs to halftime at football games.&quot; (Guerrero 1993) Hayes was also nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Original Dramatic Score and for Best Original Song with the &#x27;Theme from Shaft.&#x27;. When he won for Best Original Song, it was the first time an African American composer had won an Academy Award. &quot;The 45-single release of the record topped the US charts, hit number 4 in the UK and is still popular today, enjoying a new lease of life as a cellphone ring tone.&quot;

== Home media ==
&quot;Shaft&quot; was released on VHS, followed by a DVD release in June 2000, and a Blu-ray release in 2012. The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray in June 2022, featuring a 4K restoration.

== Sequels==
&quot;Shaft&quot; initially had two sequels called &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Big Score!&quot; (1972) and &quot;Shaft in Africa&quot; (1973), with &quot;neither capturing the soul of the original&quot;, according to author Howard Hughes. An additional sequel, and part remake, was released in 2000, also called &quot;Shaft&quot;, starring Samuel L. Jackson as the title character, and Roundtree appearing as his &quot;Uncle&quot; John Shaft. The earlier sequels were followed by a short-lived 1973–1974 television series titled &quot;Shaft&quot; on CBS. Richard Roundtree was the only person to ever play John Shaft, appearing in all four films and the television series.

Ernest Tidyman wrote six &quot;Shaft&quot; novel sequels, including &quot;Goodbye, Mr Shaft&quot; and &quot;Shaft&#x27;s Carnival of Killers&quot;.

In February 2015, TheWrap reported that &quot;Shaft&quot; would be ed by New Line Cinema with John Davis producing the new film. In July 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Kenya Barris and Alex Barnow would be writing the script, Davis and Ira Napoliello would be producing, and Richard Brener and Samuel J. Brown would direct. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that the film &quot;will have a comedic tone but will retain its action roots&quot;. When he was asked about that characterization of the film, Davis said &quot;It&#x27;s drama, but it&#x27;s going to be drama with a lot of fun moments. A lot of lighter moments.&quot; In January 2017, Deadline reports that Tim Story will direct the film, a sequel, which will follows the son of John Shaft. In August 2017, it was revealed that Richard Roundtree and Samuel L. Jackson would reprise their roles from the 2000 film, and Jessie T. Usher would portray J. J. Shaft, the son of Jackson&#x27;s character. Roundtree&#x27;s character would no longer be the uncle, but Jackson&#x27;s character&#x27;s father John Shaft Sr. In November 2017, the film was revealed to be entitled &quot;Shaft&quot; and was released on June 14, 2019.

<text>Sherlock Jr. is a 1924 American silent comedy film starring and directed by Buster Keaton and written by Clyde Bruckman, Jean Havez, and Joseph A. Mitchell. It features Kathryn McGuire, Joe Keaton, and Ward Crane.

In 1991, &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2000, the American Film Institute, as part of its AFI 100 Years... series, ranked the film #62 in its AFI&#x27;s 100 Years... 100 Laughs. David Thomson calls it &quot;a breakthrough. It is as if a filmmaker had at least learned the point of the whole thing.&quot;

==Plot==

Buster Keaton stars as Projectionist, who moonlights as an amateur detective. When the cinema is empty, he reads the book &quot;How to be a Detective.&quot; He is in love with The Girl (Kathryn McGuire) but has a rival, &quot;The Local Sheik&quot; (Ward Crane). Neither has much money. He finds a dollar note in the garbage he swept up in the lobby. He takes it and adds it to the $2 he has. A woman comes and says that she lost a dollar. He gives it back. But then a sad old woman also says that she lost a dollar, so he gives that also, leaving himself with $1. A man comes and searches the garbage and finds a wallet full of money. Projectionist buys a $1 box of chocolates, all he can afford, and changes the price to $4 before giving it to the woman he loves at her house. He later gives her a ring.

The Sheik comes into the house and steals the pocket watch of the Girl&#x27;s Father (Joe Keaton) and pawns it for $4. With the money, he buys a $3 box of chocolates for the Girl. When the Father notices that his watch is missing, the Sheik slips the pawn ticket into the Projectionist&#x27;s pocket unnoticed. The Projectionist offers to solve the crime, but when the pawn ticket is found in his pocket, he is banished from the house. When the Sheik leaves, the Projectionist shadows his every movement. The Sheik loses him by shutting him in a train car. Later, the Girl takes the pawn ticket to the pawnbroker and asks him to describe who pawned it. He points to the Sheik, standing outside.

While showing a film (advertised in the lobby as &quot;Hearts and Pearls&quot;) about the theft of a pearl necklace, the Projectionist falls asleep and dreams that he enters the movie as a detective, Sherlock Jr. The other actors are replaced by the Projectionist&#x27;s acquaintances, with the Sheik taking the role of the Villain. The dream begins with the theft being committed by the Villain with the aid of the Butler. The Girl&#x27;s Father calls for the world&#x27;s greatest detective and Sherlock Jr. arrives.

Fearing that they will be caught, the Villain and the Butler attempt to kill Sherlock Jr. through several traps, poison, and an elaborate pool game with an exploding 13 ball. When these fail, the Villain and Butler try to escape. Sherlock Jr. tracks them down to a warehouse but is outnumbered by the gang to which the villain was selling the necklace. During the confrontation, Sherlock Jr. discovers that they have kidnapped the Girl. With the help of his assistant, Gillette, Sherlock Jr. manages to save the woman, and after a car chase, manages to defeat the gang.

When he awakens, the Girl shows up to tell him that she and her father learned the identity of the real thief after she went to the pawn shop to see who actually pawned the pocket watch. As a reconciliation scene happens to be playing on the screen, the Projectionist mimics the actor&#x27;s romantic behavior.

==Production==
Originally titled &quot;The Misfit&quot;, production began in January 1924 in Los Angeles. Keaton later said that his character walking onto the screen and into a film was &quot;the reason for making the whole picture ... Just that one situation.&quot; Having cast her in &quot;Three Ages&quot;, Keaton cast Marion Harlan as the lead actress, but she became sick and was replaced by up-and-coming Keystone Studios actress Kathryn McGuire, who had previously starred in &quot;The Silent Call&quot; and was a WAMPAS Baby Star of 1923.

Keaton initially hired Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle as his co-director for the film. Keaton had been discovered by Arbuckle, whose career was at a standstill after being accused of raping Virginia Rappe in 1921. During the scandal and court case, Arbuckle had lost his mansion and cars and was in debt for $750,000. Keaton wanted to help his old friend and hired Arbuckle under the pseudonym &quot;William Goodrich&quot;. It is believed that the idea for the film was a tribute to Oscar Heinrich, the forensic scientist involved in the rape trial against Arbuckle. Filming began well and Arbuckle was happy to be back on set, but after Keaton corrected a mistake that Arbuckle had made, his attitude changed dramatically.

Arbuckle became angry and abusive on set, yelling at actors and according to Keaton becoming &quot;flushed and mad ... [the scandal] just changed his disposition.&quot; In his autobiography, Keaton claimed that Arbuckle was difficult to work with and he arranged for him to direct &quot;The Red Mill&quot; instead so that Keaton could complete the film alone. &quot;The Red Mill&quot; did not begin production until 1927. Arbuckle&#x27;s second wife Doris Deane later claimed that Arbuckle had directed the entire film and had come up with all of the ideas for the film.

The production included one of Keaton&#x27;s most famous on-set accidents. In a scene where Keaton grabs a water spout while walking on a moving boxcar train, the water unexpectedly flooded down on Keaton much harder than anticipated, throwing him to the ground. The back of Keaton&#x27;s neck slammed against a steel rail on the ground and caused him to black out. The pain was so intense that Keaton had to stop shooting later that day and he had &quot;blinding headaches&quot; for weeks afterwards, but continued working, having a well-known high threshold for physical pain.

It was not until 1935 that a doctor spotted a callus over a fracture in Keaton&#x27;s top vertebra in an X-ray. The doctor informed Keaton that he had broken his neck during the accident nine years earlier and not realized it. Keaton famously always performed his own stunts, and this was not the only accident on set. In another scene, the motorcycle Keaton was riding skidded and smashed into two cameras, knocking over Eddie Cline and throwing Keaton onto a nearby car.

&quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; was also Keaton&#x27;s most complicated film for special optical effects and in-camera tricks. The film&#x27;s most famous trick shot involves Keaton jumping into a small suitcase and disappearing. Keaton later said that it was an old vaudeville trick that his father had invented, and he later performed it on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1957, but never publicly revealed how he did it. The trick was accomplished with a trap door behind the suitcase and an actor lying horizontally with long clothes hiding his absent bottom torso, which then allowed the actor to smoothly fall forward and walk as though he had always been standing vertically.

Keaton later said that they &quot;spent an awful lot of time getting those scenes&quot;. Filming took four months, while typically it took Keaton two months to finish a feature film. The editing was also difficult and took longer than a typical Keaton film. Keaton later told film historian Kevin Brownlow &quot;every cameraman in the business went to see that picture more than once trying to figure out how the hell we did some of that.&quot;

Keaton depicted an early example of a film within a film in the dream sequence. Keaton&#x27;s character leaves the projection room and goes down into the theater, then walks into the film being screened on the stage. Keaton later explained that this stunt was achieved through the use of lighting: &quot;We built a stage with a big black cut-out screen. Then we built the front-row seats and orchestra pit. ... We lit the stage so it looked like a motion picture being projected on to a screen&quot;.

Keaton&#x27;s character is kicked out of the film a few times but finally manages to stay in, and is depicted in a series of different scenes including a park, a lake and a desert, through a series of cuts. This was unique at the time because there was a continuity to the scenes and this strategy had rarely been used by filmmakers before. Keaton and his cameraman were able to do this by using surveyor&#x27;s instruments to position Keaton and the camera at exactly the right distances and positions to support the illusion of continuity.

== Music ==
In 2014, the Dallas Chamber Symphony commissioned Craig Marks to write an original musical score for Sherlock Jr. It premiered during a concert screening at Moody Performance Hall on February 25, 2014 with Richard McKay conducting.

==Reception==

===Release and critical response===
Keaton first previewed the film in Long Beach, California. Although audience members gasped at some of the special effects, there were very few laughs, and Keaton began re-editing the film to make it funnier. However, the second preview screening was more disappointing than the first, and Keaton continued cutting the film down to a very short 5-reel film. Producer Joseph Schenck wanted Keaton to add another 1,000 feet of film (approximately 11 minutes), but Keaton refused.

The film was retitled &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; and released on April 21, 1924. It made $448,337, slightly less than &quot;Three Ages&quot;. Keaton considered the film &quot;alright [but] not one of the big ones&quot;, possibly due to the fact that it was his first real failure after a 25-year career on stage and screen.

&quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; received mixed critical reviews. It received good reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which called it &quot;one of the best screen tricks ever incorporated in a comedy&quot;, and &quot;Photoplay&quot;, which called it &quot;rare and refreshing&quot;. Other positive notices came from &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot;. Negative reviews included &quot;Picture Play&quot;, which wrote that it was devoid of &quot;ingenuity and originality&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote it was as funny as &quot;a hospital operating room&quot;. Edmund Wilson of &quot;The New Republic&quot; criticized Keaton&#x27;s performance for not having enough character development and the film for having too much &quot;machinery and stunts&quot;.

===Legacy===
Dwight Macdonald, in his book &quot;On Movies&quot;, notes the sophistication of the premise: the second half of &quot;Sherlock Junior&quot; cuts free across magical territory. By a great stroke of invention, the lovesick Buster is a movie projectionist, so that the medium becomes the artist’s material, an advanced approach Buster had never heard of ... He falls asleep in the projection booth, dreaming about his girl and his frustrated love. His &quot;doppelganger&quot; extracts itself from his sleeping body ... and walks down the aisle of the darkened theatre to climb up on the stage and into the society-crook melodrama being projected on the screen ... There&#x27;s no explanation for this or any other &quot;lapsus naturalis&quot; in this 1924 film which makes later efforts by Dalí, Buñuel and Cocteau look pedestrian and a bit timid. They felt obliged to clarify matters by a symbolistic apparatus. Keaton never rose—or sunk—to that.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; as one of the All-Time 100 Movies, writing &quot;The impeccable comedian directs himself in an impeccable silent comedy ... Is this, as some critics have argued, an example of primitive American surrealism? Sure. But let&#x27;s not get fancy about it. It is more significantly, a great example of American minimalism—simple objects and movement manipulated in casually complex ways to generate a steadily rising gale of laughter. The whole thing is only 45 minutes long, not a second of which is wasted. In an age when most comedies are all windup and no punch, this is the most treasurable of virtues.&quot;

Dennis Schwartz wrote that &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; is &quot;one of Buster&#x27;s superior silent comedies that&#x27;s noted for his usual deadpan humor, frolicsome slapstick, the number of very funny sight gags, the many innovative technical accomplishments and that he did his own stunts (including the dangerous one where he was hanging off a ladder connected to a huge water basin as the water poured out and washed him onto the railroad track, fracturing his neck nearly to the point of breaking it. Keaton suffered from severe migraines for years after making this movie).&quot; David Thomson calls &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; Keaton&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;the most philosophically eloquent of silent comedies&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes reports an 88% approval from 41 critics, with an average rating of 9.8/10.

&quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; was a major influence on Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), in which a character walks out of a movie and into real life. Forty minutes into the film, Buster jams on the brakes of the car he is driving, causing the chassis to stop and the body to keep going, a gag reused in the James Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987). In 2012, it was ranked number 61 in a list of the best-edited films of all time as selected by the members of the Motion Picture Editors Guild. In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls, it was ranked the 59th-greatest film ever made in the critics&#x27; poll. In 2015, &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; ranked 44th on BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot; list, voted on by film critics from around the world. On January 5, 2023, Richard Brody included it on his list of &quot;Thirty-four Movies That Celebrate the Movies&quot;.

On January 1, 2020, the film entered into the public domain in the United States.

==Merger in 1924==
On April 17, 1924, between the makings of Metro Pictures&#x27; &quot;Mademoiselle Midnight&quot; and &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;, Marcus Loew announced that the three companies intended merging. Eventually, the same day, they merged to form their biggest success, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
