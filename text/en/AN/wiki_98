<text>In Greek mythology, Thersites (; Ancient Greek: Θερσίτης) was a soldier of the Greek army during the Trojan War.
== Family ==
The &quot;Iliad&quot; does not mention his father&#x27;s name, which may suggest that he should be viewed as a commoner rather than an aristocratic hero. However, a quotation from another lost epic in the Trojan cycle, the &quot;Aethiopis&quot;, names his parents as Agrius of Calydon and Dia, a daughter of King Porthaon.

== Mythology ==
In some accounts, Thersites, together with his five brothers including Melanippus, overthrew Oeneus from the throne of Calydon and gave the kingdom to Agrius, their father and Oeneus&#x27;s brother. Later on, they were deposed by Diomedes who reinstated his grandfather Oeneus as king and slew all of Thersites&#x27;s brothers.

Homer described him in detail in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Book II, even though he plays only a minor role in the story. He is said to be bow-legged and lame, to have shoulders that cave inward, and a head which is covered in tufts of hair and comes to a point. This deformity has even given rise to a medical eponym. Vulgar, obscene, and somewhat dull-witted, Thersites disrupts the rallying of the Greek army:

He got up in the assembly and attacked Agamemnon in the words of Achilles [calling him greedy and a coward] ... Odysseus then stood up, delivered a sharp rebuke to Thersites, which he coupled with a threat to strip him naked, and then beat him on the back and shoulders with Agamemnon&#x27;s sceptre; Thersites doubled over, a warm tear fell from his eye, and a bloody welt formed on his back; he sat down in fear, and in pain gazed helplessly as he wiped away his tear; but the rest of the assembly was distressed and laughed ... There must be a figuration of wickedness as self-evident as Thersites—the ugliest man who came to Troy—who says what everyone else is thinking.

He is not mentioned elsewhere in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, but it seems that in the lost &quot;Aethiopis&quot; Achilles eventually killed him by punching him very hard &quot;for having torn out the eyes of the Amazon Penthesilea that the hero had just killed in combat.&quot;

In his Introduction to &quot;The Anger of Achilles&quot;, Robert Graves speculates that Homer might have made Thersites a ridiculous figure as a way of dissociating himself from him, because his remarks seem entirely justified. This was a way of letting these remarks, along with Odysseus&#x27; brutal act of suppression, remain in the record.

==In later literature==
Thersites is also mentioned in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot; (525e) as an example of a soul that can be cured in the after-life because of his lack of might; and in &quot;The Republic&quot; he chooses to be reborn as a nonhuman ape. According to E. R. Dodds, &quot;There he is not so much the typical petty criminal as the typical buffoon; and so Lucian describes him.&quot;

The &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; refers to Thersites when Alexander the Great is claimed to have said that it would be a greater honor to be immortalized in the poetry of Homer, even if only as a minor and detestable character like Thersites, than by the poets of his own day: &quot;I would sooner be a Thersites in Homer than an Agamemnon in your writing&quot;. Other recensions replace Agamemnon with Achilles in the comparison.

&quot;A New Interlude Called Thersites&quot;, an anonymous play from 1537 sometimes attributed to Nicholas Udall, is based on a Latin dialogue by Jean Tixier de Ravisi, a professor of rhetoric at the College of Navarre and rector of the University of Paris from 1520–1524, written under the pen name &quot;J. Ravisius Textor.&quot; It is described by Karl J. Holzknecht as &quot;the earliest example of the braggart soldier (&quot;miles gloriosus&quot;) on the English stage.&quot; While derived from plays of Plautus, elements such as combat with a snail (&quot;an old medieval joke, usually at the expense of the Lombards&quot;) and an episode in which Telemachus comes to the title character&#x27;s mother to be cured of worms, are wholly original to this version. 

Along with many of the major figures of the Trojan War, Thersites was a character in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1602) in which he is described as &quot;a deformed and scurrilous Grecian&quot; and portrayed as a comic servant, in the tradition of the Shakespearean fool, but unusually given to abusive remarks to all he encounters. He begins as Ajax&#x27;s slave, telling Ajax, &quot;I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee; I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece.&quot; Thersites soon leaves Ajax and puts himself into the service of Achilles (portrayed by Shakespeare as a kind of bohemian figure), who appreciates his bitter, caustic humor. Shakespeare mentions Thersites again in his later play &quot;Cymbeline&quot;, when Guiderius says, &quot;Thersites&#x27; body is as good as Ajax&#x27; / When neither are alive.&quot;

Laurence Sterne writes of Thersites in the last volume of his &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot;, chapter 14, declaring him to be the exemplar of abusive satire, as black as the ink it is written with.

In Part Two of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (1832), Act One, during the Masquerade, Thersites appears briefly and criticizes the goings-on. He says, &quot;When some lofty thing is done / I gird at once my harness on. / Up with what&#x27;s low, what&#x27;s high eschew, / Call crooked straight, and straight askew&quot;. The Herald, who acts as Master of Revels or Lord of Misrule, strikes Thersites with his mace, at which point he metamorphoses into an egg, from which a bat and an adder are hatched.

==As social critic==
The role of Thersites as a social critic has been advanced by several philosophers and literary critics, including Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, Edward Said, Thomas Woods and Kenneth Burke. In the passage below from &quot;Language as Symbolic Action&quot;, Burke cites Hegel&#x27;s coinage of the term &quot;Thersitism&quot;, and he proceeds to describe a version of it as a process by which an author both privileges protest in a literary work but also disguises or disowns it, so as not to distract from the literary form of the work, which must push on toward other effects than the protest &quot;per se&quot;:

An example of this stratagem is the role of Thersites in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. For any Greeks who were likely to resent the stupidity of the Trojan War, the text itself provided a spokesman who voiced their resistance. And he was none other than the abominable Thersites, for whom no &quot;right-minded&quot; member of the Greek audience was likely to feel sympathy. As early as Hegel, however, his standard role was beginning to be questioned. Consider, for instance, these remarks in the introduction to Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of History&quot;:

Thersites also appears in the writings of Karl Marx, and those of later Marxist literature in Soviet times much in the spirit of Hegel&#x27;s construal. Heiner Müller casts Thersites in the role of Shepherd who also shears his sheep reflecting the contradictions broached by Hegel.
==Thersites complex==
In medicine, the term Thersites complex refers to patients who have a very minor deformity, yet who are extremely anxious about it. They frequently contact surgeons to correct their &quot;highly perceived&quot; deformity. The doctors tend to ignore the complaint and refer them to psychologists and psychiatrists. Psychotherapy, however is often refused, or ineffective.

<text>In Greek mythology, Tiphys (; Ancient Greek: Τῖφυς &quot;Tîphus&quot;) was the helmsman of the Argonauts.

== Family ==
Tiphys was the Thespian son of Hagnias or of Phorbas of Elis and Hyrmine, daughter of Epeius. In the latter account, he was possibly the brother of Augeas and Actor.

== Mythology ==

=== Pilot of Argo ===
Among his crew members, Tiphys was chosen to steer the long ship Argo.

==== Apollonius&#x27; account ====

: Tiphys, son of Hagnias, left the Siphaean people of the Thespians, well skilled to foretell the rising wave on the broad sea, and well skilled to infer from sun and star the stormy winds and the time for sailing. Tritonian Athena herself urged him to join the band of chiefs, and he came among them a welcome comrade.

==== Valerius&#x27; account ====
==== Statius&#x27; account ====

: Tiphys himself wearies by his labours the heavy billows and the tiller that will not hear him, and pale with anxiety oft changes his commands, and turns right- and leftward from the land the prow that would fain dash itself to shipwreck on the rocks, until from the vessel&#x27;s tapering bows the son of Aeson holds forth the olive-branch of Pallas hat Mopsus bore, and through the tumult of his comrades would prevent him, asks for peace; his words were swept away by the headlong gale.

====&quot;Orphic Argonautica&quot;====

: He (Tiphys) left the Thespians to work on the waters of Teumessia near the mountain of poplars. He knew the painstaking art of discerning from the bellowing and flashing of storms when and how to guide the ship.

=== Death ===
During the voyage to Colchis, Tiphys died of a mysterious illness in the land of the Mariandynians or, according to some sources, a snakebite. After his death, Ancaeus piloted the &quot;Argo&quot;.

<doc id="84726" wikidata="Q172290" url="?curid=84726" title="Sulfate">
<text>The sulfate or sulphate ion is a polyatomic anion with the empirical formula . Salts, acid derivatives, and peroxides of sulfate are widely used in industry. Sulfates occur widely in everyday life. Sulfates are salts of sulfuric acid and many are prepared from that acid.

==Spelling==

&quot;Sulfate&quot; is the spelling recommended by IUPAC, but &quot;sulphate&quot; was traditionally used in British English.

==Structure==
The sulfate anion consists of a central sulfur atom surrounded by four equivalent oxygen atoms in a tetrahedral arrangement. The symmetry of the isolated anion is the same as that of methane. The sulfur atom is in the +6 oxidation state while the four oxygen atoms are each in the −2 state. The sulfate ion carries an overall charge of −2 and it is the conjugate base of the bisulfate (or hydrogensulfate) ion, , which is in turn the conjugate base of , sulfuric acid. Organic sulfate esters, such as dimethyl sulfate, are covalent compounds and esters of sulfuric acid. The tetrahedral molecular geometry of the sulfate ion is as predicted by VSEPR theory.

==Bonding==

The first description of the bonding in modern terms was by Gilbert Lewis in his groundbreaking paper of 1916 where he described the bonding in terms of electron octets around each atom, that is no double bonds and a formal charge of +2 on the sulfur atom and -1 on each oxygen atom.

Later, Linus Pauling used valence bond theory to propose that the most significant resonance canonicals had two pi bonds involving d orbitals. His reasoning was that the charge on sulfur was thus reduced, in accordance with his principle of electroneutrality. The S−O bond length of 149 pm is shorter than the bond lengths in sulfuric acid of 157 pm for S−OH. The double bonding was taken by Pauling to account for the shortness of the S−O bond.

Pauling&#x27;s use of d orbitals provoked a debate on the relative importance of pi bonding and bond polarity (electrostatic attraction) in causing the shortening of the S−O bond. The outcome was a broad consensus that d orbitals play a role, but are not as significant as Pauling had believed.

A widely accepted description involving pπ – dπ bonding was initially proposed by Durward William John Cruickshank. In this model, fully occupied p orbitals on oxygen overlap with empty sulfur d orbitals (principally the d&quot;z&quot;2 and d&quot;x&quot;2–&quot;y&quot;2). However, in this description, despite there being some π character to the S−O bonds, the bond has significant ionic character. For sulfuric acid, computational analysis (with natural bond orbitals) confirms a clear positive charge on sulfur (theoretically +2.45) and a low 3d occupancy. Therefore, the representation with four single bonds is the optimal Lewis structure rather than the one with two double bonds (thus the Lewis model, not the Pauling model). 

In this model, the structure obeys the octet rule and the charge distribution is in agreement with the electronegativity of the atoms. The discrepancy between the S−O bond length in the sulfate ion and the S−OH bond length in sulfuric acid is explained by donation of p-orbital electrons from the terminal S=O bonds in sulfuric acid into the antibonding S−OH orbitals, weakening them resulting in the longer bond length of the latter.

However, Pauling&#x27;s representation for sulfate and other main group compounds with oxygen is still a common way of representing the bonding in many textbooks. The apparent contradiction can be clarified if one realizes that the covalent double bonds in the Lewis structure actually represent bonds that are strongly polarized by more than 90% towards the oxygen atom. On the other hand, in the structure with a dipolar bond, the charge is localized as a lone pair on the oxygen.

==Preparation==
Typically metal sulfates are prepared by treating metal oxides, metal carbonates, or the metal itself with sulfuric acid:
:
Although written with simple anhydrous formulas, these conversions generally are conducted in the presence of water. Consequently the product sulfates are hydrated, corresponding to zinc sulfate , copper(II) sulfate , and cadmium sulfate .

Some metal sulfides can be oxidized to give metal sulfates.

==Properties==
There are numerous examples of ionic sulfates, many of which are highly soluble in water. Exceptions include calcium sulfate, strontium sulfate, lead(II) sulfate, barium sulfate, silver sulfate, and mercury sulfate, which are poorly soluble. Radium sulfate is the most insoluble sulfate known. The barium derivative is useful in the gravimetric analysis of sulfate: if one adds a solution of most barium salts, for instance barium chloride, to a solution containing sulfate ions, barium sulfate will precipitate out of solution as a whitish powder. This is a common laboratory test to determine if sulfate anions are present.

The sulfate ion can act as a ligand attaching either by one oxygen (monodentate) or by two oxygens as either a chelate or a bridge. An example is the complex or the neutral metal complex where the sulfate ion is acting as a bidentate ligand. The metal–oxygen bonds in sulfate complexes can have significant covalent character.

==Uses and occurrence==

===Commercial applications===

Sulfates are widely used industrially. Major compounds include:

* Gypsum, the natural mineral form of hydrated calcium sulfate, is used to produce plaster. About 100 million tonnes per year are used by the construction industry.
* Copper sulfate, a common algaecide, the more stable form () is used for galvanic cells as electrolyte
* Iron(II) sulfate, a common form of iron in mineral supplements for humans, animals, and soil for plants
* Magnesium sulfate (commonly known as Epsom salts), used in therapeutic baths
* Lead(II) sulfate, produced on both plates during the discharge of a lead–acid battery
* Sodium laureth sulfate, or SLES, a common detergent in shampoo formulations
* Polyhalite, , used as fertiliser.

===Occurrence in nature===
Sulfate-reducing bacteria, some anaerobic microorganisms, such as those living in sediment or near deep sea thermal vents, use the reduction of sulfates coupled with the oxidation of organic compounds or hydrogen as an energy source for chemosynthesis.

==History==
Some sulfates were known to alchemists. The vitriol salts, from the Latin &quot;vitreolum&quot;, glassy, were so-called because they were some of the first transparent crystals known. Green vitriol is iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate, ; blue vitriol is copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, and white vitriol is zinc sulfate heptahydrate, . Alum, a double sulfate of potassium and aluminium with the formula , figured in the development of the chemical industry.

==Environmental effects==
Sulfates occur as microscopic particles (aerosols) resulting from fossil fuel and biomass combustion. They increase the acidity of the atmosphere and form acid rain. The anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria &quot;Desulfovibrio desulfuricans&quot; and &quot;D. vulgaris&quot; can remove the black sulfate crust that often tarnishes buildings.

===Main effects on climate===

====Reversal and accelerated warming====

====Hydrological cycle====
====Solar geoengineering====

==Hydrogensulfate (bisulfate)==
The hydrogensulfate ion (), also called the bisulfate ion, is the conjugate base of sulfuric acid (). Sulfuric acid is classified as a strong acid; in aqueous solutions it ionizes completely to form hydronium () and hydrogensulfate () ions. In other words, the sulfuric acid behaves as a Brønsted–Lowry acid and is deprotonated to form hydrogensulfate ion. Hydrogensulfate has a valency of 1. An example of a salt containing the ion is sodium bisulfate, . In dilute solutions the hydrogensulfate ions also dissociate, forming more hydronium ions and sulfate ions ().

<doc id="84727" wikidata="Q8143" url="?curid=84727" title="1932 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1932 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the X Olympiad and also known as Los Angeles 1932) were an international multi-sport event held from July 30 to August 14, 1932, in Los Angeles, California, United States. The Games were held during the worldwide Great Depression, with some nations not traveling to Los Angeles as a result; 37 countries competed, compared to the 46 at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam, and even then-U.S. President Herbert Hoover did not attend the Games. The organizing committee did not report the financial details of the Games, although contemporary newspapers stated that the Games had made a profit of .

==Host city selection==
The selection of the host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics was made at the 23rd IOC Session in Rome, Italy, on April 9, 1923. Remarkably, the selection process consisted of a single bid, from Los Angeles’ Olympic Committee led by Billy May Garland, and as there were no bids from any other city, Los Angeles was selected by default to host the 1932 Games.

==Highlights==
===Facilities and opening ceremony===
Charles Curtis became the first and only U.S. Vice President to inaugurate the Olympic Games. An Olympic Village was built for the first time and became a model for future games, in Baldwin Hills, occupied by male athletes. Female athletes were housed at the Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard. Tenth Street, a major thoroughfare in Los Angeles, was renamed Olympic Boulevard in honor of the Games of the Tenth Olympiad. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was known in 1932 as &quot;Olympic Stadium&quot;.

The victory podium was used for the first time at the summer games (a podium was also used earlier in the year at the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid). An Olympic mascot, Scottish Terrier Smoky, was featured for the first time in history, albeit unofficially. 

===Athletics and field events===
Babe Didrikson won two gold medals in the javelin and the hurdles event. She also competed in a jump-off for a gold in the high jump. Her technique in the jump-off was ruled illegal, leaving Didrikson with second place.

Finland&#x27;s Paavo Nurmi was suspended from competition by the IAAF for alleged violation of amateur rules. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi&#x27;s amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international. After Nurmi&#x27;s suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.

Eddie Tolan won both the 100 m and 200 m sprint events. Poland&#x27;s Stanisława Walasiewicz won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s 100 m; she also won the silver medal in the event four years later. After her death in 1980, it was discovered that she was intersex and would have been ineligible to participate under modern rules.

Due to an official&#x27;s error, the 3,000 m steeplechase went for 3,460 m, or one extra lap.

Several women&#x27;s events debuted at these games, among them the 80 meters hurdles and javelin throw. Babe Didrikson won both events and also competed in the high jump where she was controversially denied gold, leaving her with silver. As women, unlike men, were only allowed to enter a maximum of three events, Didrikson could not compete in the discus throw, long jump, and relay where she would have likely medaled based on her prior results. Had the 200 meters and pentathlon been contested at these games (they debuted in 1964), Didrikson would have won them easily based on her performances prior to the Olympics.

===Team sports===
In field hockey, only three nations took part. The host nation lost both matches, 1–24 to India and 2–9 to Japan, but still won a bronze medal.

===Gymnastics===
Romeo Neri won three gold medals in gymnastics. Although women&#x27;s team gymnastics debuted in the previous Olympics, the event was not held in these games; however, there were women gymnasts who traveled to Los Angeles and participated in exhibition events at the 1932 games. 

===Swimming===
Helene Madison won three gold medals in swimming, while the Japanese upset the men&#x27;s events and took all but one title. Kusuo Kitamura won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s 1500 meter freestyle swimming race. He was and continues to be the youngest ever male swimmer to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games.

===Equestrian===
Takeichi Nishi (Baron Nishi) was the gold medalist with his horse Uranus in the equestrian show jumping individual event. Nishi&#x27;s gold medal is Japan&#x27;s only gold medal in the equestrian event to this day. Nishi died in 1945 as an officer stationed in the defense of the island of Iwo Jima, and as such is an important character in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s film, &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot;.

===Cycling===
Dunc Gray won Australia&#x27;s first cycling gold medal; he set a world record of 1m 13s in the 1000 time trial. The Dunc Gray Velodrome, built for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, was named after him.

==Medals awarded==
117 events in 20 disciplines, comprising 14 sports, were part of the Olympic program in 1932. In one of two Equestrian jumping events (team competitions) no medals were awarded. The number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.

===Art===
The Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics awarded medals for works inspired by sport-related themes in five categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture.

==Venues==
Fifteen sports venues were used for the 1932 Summer Olympics. In order to control costs in the wake of the Great Depression, existing venues were used. They included two golf courses, two city parks, three public highways, and a city road. The Swimming Stadium was the only new venue constructed for these games. The Rose Bowl, constructed in 1921, was made into a temporary velodrome for track cycling events under the auspices of the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, constructed in 1923, was used as the Olympic Stadium. The Olympic Auditorium was constructed in 1924 in preparation for Los Angeles being awarded the Games; it was modified to meet the specifications of the boxing, weightlifting, and wrestling federations. Long Beach Marine Stadium was created in 1925 when Alamitos Bay was dredged, then further dredged seven years later in time for the 1932 Games. Elysian Park, the oldest city park in Los Angeles, was founded in 1886, and has been part of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) training academy since 1925. The Riviera Country Club opened in 1926 as the Los Angeles Athletic Club Golf Course and was renamed Riviera by the time of the 1932 Games. The Swimming Stadium, constructed adjacent to the Coliseum in 1932, was intended to be a temporary structure. Riverside Drive, Los Angeles Avenue, Vineyard Avenue, and the Pacific Coast Highway were common driving routes in California at the time of the 1932 Games.

The Coliseum was the first (&amp; temporary) Los Angeles home for the National League (NL) Dodgers baseball team when it moved from Brooklyn, New York before the 1958 season. The following year, it hosted the 2nd 1959 MLB All-Star Game and games 3, 4 &amp; 5 of the 1959 World Series. When Dodger Stadium was completed in 1962, the Dodgers moved there where they have been since. The National Football League (NFL) Los Angeles Rams used the Coliseum as its host stadium from 1946 to 1979 when it moved to Anaheim, located southeast of Los Angeles. It also hosted what became known as Super Bowl I in 1967. Even the American Football League&#x27;s Chargers used the Coliseum as a venue in 1960 until their move to San Diego the following year. The Coliseum continues to host USC Trojans football games to this day, and also hosted UCLA Bruins football for a number of years. The Rams returned to the Coliseum for a span of four years from 2016 to 2019 while SoFi Stadium was being built.

The track constructed in the Rose Bowl was given to the Tournament of Roses Association upon completion of the 1932 Games. The Bowl was expanded between 1932 and the 1984 Summer Olympics three times, increasing its capacity from 83,000 in 1931 to 104,594 in 1972. It hosted Super Bowl XI in 1977, where the Oakland Raiders defeated the Minnesota Vikings 32–14. It is the current home of UCLA Bruins football and the Rose Bowl Game, and was the home of the Major League Soccer (MLS) Los Angeles Galaxy from 1996 to 2003.

Elysian Park&#x27;s shooting range was left intact for the LAPD to use. Sunset Fields Golf Club was renamed Brentwood Country Club in 1941 and is still in use as of 2010. All of the road courses were returned to public usage after the Olympics. The Olympic Auditorium continued to be of use for boxing and roller derby events until June 2005 when it was bought to be used as a megachurch. Los Angeles Harbor continues to be a major sea port in the Western United States, employing 919,000 people and generating US$39.1 billion in annual wages and tax revenues as of 2007. The Riveria Country Club continues to host golf events, hosting the 1948 U.S. Open and the PGA Championship in 1983 and 1995. The Swim Stadium was renovated in 2003 and continues to be in use as of 2010.

For the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Coliseum and the Rose Bowl were used as venues.

==Participating nations==

A total of 37 nations were represented at the 1932 Games. Colombia made its first appearance at the Olympic Games, and the Republic of China competed for the first time after its failed appearance at the 1924 Games.

<text>Western Connecticut State University (WCSU and WestConn) is a public university in Danbury, Connecticut. It was founded in 1903 as a teacher&#x27;s college and is part of the Connecticut State University System.

WCSU consists of four schools: the Ancell School of Business, the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Professional Studies, and the School of Visual and Performing Arts. The university offers 38 Bachelor&#x27;s and one associate degree programs, 15 Master&#x27;s degree programs, and two doctoral programs. WCSU is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

WCSU is home to the Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies, which is the result of a partnership between WCSU and the Jane Goodall Institute (a private non-profit organization that promotes research, education and wildlife conservation). The university&#x27;s Westside campus houses the Ives Concert Park, one of the premier performance venues in the area.

Western Connecticut State University is part of the Little East Conference and Massachusetts State Collegiate Athletic Conference in NCAA Division III. WCSU has 14 varsity sports

Students from New York and New Jersey residents pay in-state tuition; students from New England pay reduced rates because of WCSU&#x27;s participation in the New England Board of Higher Education&#x27;s Regional Student Program.

== History ==

=== Founding and growth ===

WCSU was founded in 1903 as a teachers&#x27; college, training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut&#x27;s Fairfield County and surrounding areas. The school&#x27;s name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the Danbury Normal School (also known as the Danbury State Normal School), the school changed its name twice in the 1930s: it became the Danbury Unit of the Teachers College of Connecticut in 1933 and then the Danbury State Teachers College in 1937. The college was renamed Danbury State College in 1959, Western Connecticut State College in 1967, and, finally, Western Connecticut State University in 1983. In 2011, governance of the university was transferred to the Connecticut State Colleges &amp; Universities system.

In 1904, 41 students were enrolled in the first classes on campus, the number of enrollments climbing to 362 students by 1912.

=== WXCI and music publicization ===

In 1968, WCSU&#x27;s radio station, WXCI (91.7 FM), then going by the call sign WCST and broadcasting with AM transmission, was established.

In 1973 WCST was switched from AM to FM transmission, obtained an FCC license, was renamed WXCI, and went on air under that call sign.

In the early 1980s, WXCI became one of the first FM stations to focus on alternative rock. Throughout the 80s the station was instrumental in promoting the work of a number of contemporary bands and musicians. While the station is perhaps best known for popularizing the English band Duran Duran in the United States, it also helped to familiarize the American audience with other projects and musicians from Great Britain, such as Elvis Costello and Culture Club. It popularized among residents of the Northeastern U.S. the West Coast punk group Black Flag and the Georgia-based R.E.M., while also providing greater listenership to New York City&#x27;s Talking Heads. Thurston Moore, a founding member of Sonic Youth, attended WCSU for a quarter during the fall of 1976, though he left afterward.

=== Jane Goodall Institute and environmental projects ===
In 1995, the Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies (JGC) was founded on campus. The center is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to environmental stewardship and conservation, and wildlife education and research, being the result of a partnership between Western and the Jane Goodall Institute (JGI). Since the center&#x27;s founding, its namesake, primatologist Dr. Jane Goodall, has visited Western on at least a dozen occasions to give lectures on the issue of ecology.

The center has also hosted a number of seminars and public talks by other environmentalist speakers at the university: Notably, Smithsonian ethnobotanist Mark Plotkin and veteran ecologist Thomas Lovejoy spoke at the university in 1998, and in 2013 ocean conservationist Fabien Cousteau presented a public seminar on campus.

In 2005, Western was established by JGI as a &quot;National Center for University Roots and Shoots&quot;; this event resulted in the institution of the eponymous student environmental club, a chapter of the international Roots &amp; Shoots (also known as Jane Goodall&#x27;s Roots &amp; Shoots), on campus. Roots &amp; Shoots is a subsidiary organization of JGI, and its WCSU chapter is one of only several based in the United States. The club&#x27;s office, located in the Midtown campus&#x27;s White Hall, remained the first of its kind between 2005 and 2012; afterwards, the organization&#x27;s international headquarters was established at JGI&#x27;s head office in Washington, D.C.

Roots &amp; Shoots serves as, according to the university and the JGC, &quot;a regional and national office of excellence in training university students, faculty and administrators to develop programs for K–12 and college students in local, regional and global conservation.&quot;

=== Significant visitors and lectures ===
The university was visited by former President Bill Clinton in 2005 and by the 14th Dalai Lama in 2012.

=== Campus ===
WCSU has two campuses, midtown and westside, both located in Danbury. The campuses are three miles (5 km) apart and connected by a university shuttle service.

The midtown campus is the original campus, located on White Street near downtown Danbury and the Main Street Historic District. It is home to the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, School of Professional Studies, and most of the university&#x27;s administration. Dormitories on this campus include Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall. The Midtown student center is located on this campus. In 2018, the fully renovated Higgins Hall reopened. Higgins Hall features the MSAS Dean&#x27;s offices.

The westside campus is located on land purchased in 1969 on the outskirts of Danbury. This lot is home to the Ancell School of Business, the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the Westside Nature Preserve, an amphitheater and three residence halls. Westside also houses athletic facilities, including the William O&#x27;Neill Athletic and Convocation Center (completed in 1995), and the Westside Athletic Complex (completed in 2003), as well as an observatory with a 20-inch Ritchy-Chretien telescope and a 20-foot planetarium dome. On January 23, 2007, the Westside Campus Center was officially opened. This new facility serves as a student center, meeting and banquet facility for the Westside campus. In August 2014, the Westside campus saw the opening of the new Visual and Performing Arts Center, a comprehensive arts building with Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts wings.

A major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus. Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.

In April 2013, startup of a newly installed fuel cell power unit for the Science Building on the university&#x27;s Midtown campus began. The PureCell System, provided by ClearEdge Power, supports the university to reap significant energy cost savings and enhanced electricity and heating efficiencies.

The Midtown campus Science Building was the first state-funded building project to seek LEED Silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. The Visual and Performing Arts Center as well as Centennial Hall also obtained LEED certification. In 2014, WCSU installed four EV (electric vehicle) charging stations, two on each campus. These charging stations are available to both students and the public, free of charge. The university is a participant in EV Connecticut Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions program.
The &quot;WestConn at Waterbury&quot; program is located on the campus of Naugatuck Valley Community College in Waterbury, Connecticut. The program offers completion courses for a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in management or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), as well as a Master of Health Administration (M.H.A.).

==Mascot==
The original Western Connecticut State mascot was an Indian. A mascot committee formed to find a less offensive name in 1974 recommended changing the name to Canners, &quot;a name that our teams can carry with respect.&quot; From 1975 to 1978, the school adopted the nickname Canners to honor the region&#x27;s fish canneries, and in conjunction with a sponsorship with the Candlewood Canning Company of Connecticut. But once the sponsorship was deemed illegal by the NCAA, the official mascot became Chuck the Colonial, a man in a blue Tricorne hat. Following the murder of George Floyd and pressure from alumni and students in June 2020, the university announced the formation of a committee to determine the fate of the mascot and the Colonials nickname and decided to no longer use these. On April 19, 2022, the university announced that they would be changing their mascot name to the Wolves.

<text>Professor James Moriarty is a fictional character and criminal mastermind created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to be a formidable enemy for the author&#x27;s fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. He was created primarily as a device by which Doyle could kill Holmes and end the hero&#x27;s stories. Professor Moriarty first appears in the short story &quot;The Adventure of the Final Problem&quot;, first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1893. He also plays a role in the final Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, but without a direct appearance. Holmes mentions Moriarty in five other stories: &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Illustrious Client&quot;, and &quot;His Last Bow&quot;.

Moriarty is a criminal mastermind who uses his intelligence and resources to provide criminals with crime strategies and sometimes protection from the law, all in exchange for a fee or a cut of profit. Holmes likens Moriarty to a spider at the centre of a web and calls him the &quot;Napoleon of crime&quot;, a phrase Doyle lifted from a Scotland Yard inspector referring to Adam Worth, a real-life criminal mastermind and one of the individuals upon whom the character of Moriarty was based. Despite appearing only twice in Doyle&#x27;s original stories, later adaptations and pastiches have given Moriarty greater prominence, often using him as the main antagonist, and treated him as Sherlock Holmes&#x27; archenemy.

==Appearances in works==
Professor Moriarty&#x27;s first appearance occurred in the 1893 short story &quot;The Adventure of the Final Problem&quot; (set in 1891). The story features consulting detective Sherlock Holmes revealing to his friend and biographer Doctor Watson that for years now he has suspected many seemingly isolated crimes to actually all be the machinations of a single, vast, and subtle criminal organisation. After investigation, he has uncovered Professor Moriarty as a mastermind who provides strategy and protection to criminals in exchange for obedience and a share in their profits. Moriarty realizes Holmes is aware of his operation and confronts him in person, threatening death if Holmes interferes any further.

Holmes describes Moriarty&#x27;s physical appearance to Watson, saying the professor is extremely tall and thin, clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking. He has a forehead that &quot;domes out in a white curve&quot;, deeply sunken eyes, and shoulders that are &quot;rounded from much study&quot;. His face protrudes forward and is always slowly oscillating from side to side &quot;in a curiously reptilian fashion&quot;. Holmes mentions that during their meeting, Moriarty remarked in surprise, &quot;You have less frontal development than I should have expected,&quot; indicating the criminal believes in phrenology.

Holmes ignores the threat and delivers appropriate evidence to the police so Moriarty and those who operate his network will face justice in a few days. Knowing the mastermind and his trusted lieutenants intend to kill him before they hide or are arrested, Holmes flees to Switzerland, and Watson joins him. The mastermind follows, his pursuit ending when he confronts Holmes at the top of the Reichenbach Falls. Watson does not witness the confrontation but arrives later to find signs of hand-to-hand combat occurring at the cliff edge near the waterfall, indicating the battle ended with both men falling to their deaths. Watson also finds a goodbye note left behind by Holmes that Moriarty allowed him to write before their battle.

Moriarty plays a direct role in only one other Holmes story, &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; (1914), set before &quot;The Final Problem&quot; but written afterwards. In &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, Holmes attempts to prevent Moriarty&#x27;s men from committing a murder. A policeman who interviewed Moriarty tells Holmes that the professor has a painting by Jean-Baptiste Greuze hanging on his office wall. Learning this, Holmes mentions the great value of another painting by the same artist, pointing out such works could not have been purchased on a university professor&#x27;s salary. The work referred to is ; which some commentators have described as a pun by Doyle on a famous Thomas Gainsborough painting, the &quot;Portrait of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire&quot;, which was taken from the Thomas Agnew and Sons art gallery. The gallery believed Adam Worth (the criminal who helped inspire Doyle to create Moriarty) was responsible, but was unable to prove the claim.

Holmes mentions Moriarty in five other stories: &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; (the immediate sequel to &quot;The Final Problem&quot;), &quot;The Adventure of the Norwood Builder&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter&quot;, &quot;The Adventure of the Illustrious Client&quot;, and &quot;His Last Bow&quot; (the final adventure in Holmes&#x27;s canon timeline, taking place years after he has officially retired).

Doctor Watson, even when narrating, never meets Moriarty (only getting distant glimpses of him in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;) and relies upon Holmes to relate accounts of the detective&#x27;s feud with the criminal. Doyle is inconsistent on Watson&#x27;s familiarity with Moriarty. In &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, Watson tells Holmes he has never heard of Moriarty, while in &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, set earlier on, Watson already knows of him as &quot;the famous scientific criminal.&quot;

In &quot;The Empty House&quot;, Holmes says Moriarty commissioned a powerful air gun from a blind German mechanic surnamed von Herder, a weapon later used by the professor&#x27;s employee/acolyte Colonel Moran. It closely resembles a cane, allows easy concealment, is capable of firing revolver bullets at long range, and makes very little noise when fired, making it ideal for criminal sniping. Moriarty also has a marked preference for organising lethal &quot;accidents&quot; to befall his targets. His attempts to kill Holmes include falling masonry and a speeding horse-drawn vehicle. He is also responsible for stage-managing the death of Birdy Edwards, making it appear the man was lost overboard while sailing to South Africa.

==Personality==
Moriarty is highly ruthless, shown by his steadfast vow to Sherlock Holmes that &quot;if you are clever enough to bring destruction upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you&quot;. Moriarty is categorised by Holmes as an extremely powerful criminal mastermind adept at committing any atrocity to perfection without losing any sleep over it. It is stated in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; that Moriarty does not directly participate in the activities he plans, but only orchestrates the events or provides the plans that will lead to a successful crime. What makes Moriarty so dangerous is his extremely cunning intellect:
Holmes echoes and expounds this sentiment in &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, stating:
Moriarty respects Holmes&#x27;s intelligence, stating: &quot;It has been an intellectual treat for me to see the manner in which you [Holmes] have grappled with this case.&quot; Nevertheless, he makes numerous attempts upon Holmes&#x27;s life through his agents. He shows a fiery disposition, becoming enraged when his plans are thwarted, resulting in his being placed &quot;in positive danger of losing my liberty&quot;. While personally pursuing Holmes at a train station, he furiously elbows aside passengers, heedless of whether this draws attention to himself.

Doyle&#x27;s original motive in creating Moriarty was evidently his intention to kill Holmes off. &quot;The Final Problem&quot; was intended to be exactly what its title says; Doyle sought to sweeten the pill by letting Holmes go in a blaze of glory, having rid the world of a criminal so powerful and dangerous that any further task would be trivial in comparison (as Holmes says in the story itself). Eventually, however, public pressure and financial troubles impelled Doyle to bring Holmes back. While Doyle conceded to revealing that Holmes did not die during &quot;The Final Problem&quot; (as Watson mistakenly concludes), he chose not to undo Moriarty&#x27;s death in a similar fashion. For this reason, the later novel &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; features Moriarty as an active villain but is specified to take place before the events of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
As established in Doyle&#x27;s canon, Moriarty first gains recognition at the age of 21 for writing &quot;a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem&quot;, which leads to his being awarded the Mathematical Chair at one of England&#x27;s smaller universities. Moriarty later authors a much respected work titled &quot;The Dynamics of an Asteroid&quot;. After he becomes the subject of unspecified &quot;dark rumours&quot; in the university town, he is compelled to resign his teaching post and leave the area. He moves to London, where he establishes himself as an &quot;army coach&quot;, a private tutor to officers preparing for exams. He becomes a consulting criminal mastermind for various London gangs and criminals (it is uncertain if he was already doing this before leaving his teaching post). When multiple plans of his are hampered or undone by Sherlock Holmes, Moriarty targets the consulting detective.

Multiple pastiches and other works outside of Doyle&#x27;s stories purport to provide additional information about Moriarty&#x27;s background. John F. Bowers, a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Leeds, wrote a tongue-in-cheek article in 1989 in which he assesses Moriarty&#x27;s contributions to mathematics and gives a detailed description of Moriarty&#x27;s background, including a statement that Moriarty was born in Ireland (an idea based on the fact that the surname is Irish in origin). The 2005 pastiche novel &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized Biography&quot; also reports that Moriarty was born in Ireland, and states that he was employed as a professor by Durham University. According to the 2020 audio drama &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Voice of Treason&quot;, written by George Mann and Cavan Scott, Moriarty was a professor at Stonyhurst College (where Arthur Conan Doyle was educated and knew two students with the surname Moriarty).

===Family===
The stories give contradictory indications about Moriarty&#x27;s family. In his first appearance in &quot;The Final Problem&quot; (1893), the villain is referred to only as &quot;Professor Moriarty&quot;. Watson mentions no forename but does refer to the name of another family member when he writes of &quot;the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother&quot;. In &quot;The Adventure of the Empty House&quot; (1903), Holmes refers to Moriarty as &quot;Professor James Moriarty&quot;. This is the only time Moriarty is given a first name, and oddly, it is the same as that of his purported brother. In the 1914 novel &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; (written after the preceding two stories, but set earlier), Holmes says of Professor Moriarty: &quot;He is unmarried. His younger brother is a station master in the west of England.&quot; In &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts&quot;, an 1899 stage play, of which Doyle was a co-author, the villain is named Professor Robert Moriarty.

Writer Vincent Starrett suggested that Moriarty could have one brother (who is both a colonel and station master) or two brothers (one a colonel and the other a station master); he added that he considered the presence of two siblings more likely, and suggested that all three brothers were named James. Writer Leslie S. Klinger suggested that Professor Moriarty has an older brother named Colonel James Moriarty in addition to an unnamed younger brother. According to Klinger, writer Ian McQueen proposed that Moriarty does not actually have any brothers, while Sherlockian John Bennett Shaw suggested, like Starrett, that there are three Moriarty brothers, all named James.

==Real-world role models==
&quot;Moriarty&quot; is an ancient Irish name as is Moran, the surname of Moriarty&#x27;s henchman, Sebastian Moran. Doyle himself was of Irish Catholic descent, educated at Stonyhurst College, although he abandoned his family&#x27;s religious tradition, neither marrying nor raising his children in the Catholic faith, nor cleaving to any politics that his ethnic background might presuppose. Doyle is known to have used his experiences at Stonyhurst as inspiration for details of the Holmes series; among his contemporaries at the school were two boys surnamed Moriarty.

ln addition to the master criminal Adam Worth, there has been speculation among astronomers and Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts that Doyle based his fictional character Moriarty on the Canadian-American astronomer Simon Newcomb. Newcomb was revered as a multitalented genius, with a special mastery of mathematics, and he had become internationally famous in the years before Doyle began writing his stories. More to the point, Newcomb had earned a reputation for spite and malice, apparently seeking to destroy the careers and reputations of rival scientists.
Moriarty may have been inspired in part by two real-world mathematicians. If the characterisations of Moriarty&#x27;s academic papers are reversed, they describe real mathematical events. Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote a famous paper on the dynamics of an asteroid in his early 20s, and was appointed to a chair partly on the strength of this result. Srinivasa Ramanujan wrote about generalisations of the binomial theorem, and earned a reputation as a genius by writing articles that confounded the best extant mathematicians. Gauss&#x27;s story was well known in Doyle&#x27;s time, and Ramanujan&#x27;s story unfolded at Cambridge from early 1913 to mid 1914; &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;, which contains the comment about maths so abstruse that no one could criticise it, was published in September 1914. Irish mathematician Des MacHale has suggested George Boole may have been a model for Moriarty.

Jane Stanford, in &quot;That Irishman&quot;, suggests that Doyle borrowed some of the traits and background of the Fenian John O&#x27;Connor Power for his portrayal of Moriarty. In &quot;Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel&quot;, 2017, Stanford explores Doyle&#x27;s relationship with the Irish literary and political community in London. She suggests that Moriarty, Ireland&#x27;s Napoleon, represents the Fenian threat at the heart of the British Empire. O&#x27;Connor Power studied at St Jarlath&#x27;s Diocesan College in Tuam, County Galway. In his third and last year he was Professor of Humanities. As an ex-professor, the Fenian leader successfully made a bid for a Westminster seat in County Mayo.

It is averred that surviving Jesuit priests at the preparatory school Hodder Place, Stonyhurst, instantly recognised the physical description of Moriarty as that of the Rev. Thomas Kay, SJ, Prefect of Discipline, under whose authority Doyle fell as a wayward pupil. According to this hypothesis, Doyle as a private joke has Inspector MacDonald describe Moriarty: &quot;He&#x27;d have made a grand meenister with his thin face and grey hair and his solemn-like way of talking.&quot;

The model which Doyle himself cited (through Sherlock Holmes) in &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot; is the London arch-criminal of the 18th century, Jonathan Wild. He mentions this when seeking to compare Moriarty to a real-world character that Inspector Alec MacDonald might know, but it is in vain as MacDonald is not so well read as Holmes.

==Legacy==

T. S. Eliot&#x27;s character Macavity the Mystery Cat is based on Moriarty. Author Timothy Zahn&#x27;s fictional Star Wars warlord Nuso Esva is also based on the professor; in fact, if each consonant and vowel of the character&#x27;s name is replaced with the consonants and vowels before them in the Latin alphabet, &quot;Nuso Esva&quot; becomes &quot;Moriarty.&quot;

A Sherlockian society was formed by noted Sherlockian John Bennett Shaw called &quot;The Brothers Three of Moriarty&quot;, in honour of Professor Moriarty and his two brothers. The group held annual dinners in Moriarty, New Mexico.

The action movie &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003) has a character named &quot;M&quot;, later known as Moriarty.

<doc id="84766" wikidata="Q919859" url="?curid=84766" title="Role and reference grammar">
<text>Role and reference grammar (RRG) is a model of grammar developed by William A. Foley and Robert Van Valin, Jr. in the 1980s, which incorporates many of the points of view of current functional grammar theories.

In RRG, the description of a sentence in a particular language is formulated in terms of (a) its logical (semantic) structure and communicative functions, and (b) the grammatical procedures that are available in the language for the expression of these meanings.

Among the main features of RRG are the use of lexical decomposition, based upon the predicate semantics of David Dowty (1979), an analysis of clause structure, and the use of a set of thematic roles organized into a hierarchy in which the highest-ranking roles are &#x27;Actor&#x27; (for the most active participant) and &#x27;Undergoer&#x27;.

RRG&#x27;s practical approach to language is demonstrated in the multilingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) system of cognitive scientist John Ball. In 2012, Ball integrated his Patom Theory with Role and Reference Grammar, producing a language independent NLU breaking down language by meaning.

<text>Delia &#x27;Chiquita&#x27; Gonzalez (born November 20, 1971) is an American former flyweight female boxer. She has a record of 13-9-4 with 3 knockout wins, although several of her losses have been controversial.

==Personal and early life==
Gonzalez is Mexican-American, and trained at the gym under her father&#x27;s guidance. Soon she earned the nickname &quot;Chiquita&quot;, after her favorite boxer, the former 2 time World flyweight champion Humberto &quot;Chiquita&quot; Gonzalez of Mexico.

==Career==
As a professional, Delia began with a 4-round decision win over Lucy Tellez in Texas. A couple of fights later, she beat Gloria Ramirez twice, once by knockout in the 3rd, and once by decision in 4. Both fights again took place in Texas. Two more wins followed and a title shot came after that, and she beat Klee Fenie in Las Vegas to become the WIBF&#x27;s world Flyweight champion. She defended her title against Anissa Zamarron winning on points, then met Phoenix&#x27;s Yvonne Trevino which the judges called a technical draw (word used for tie in boxing). She later met Jolene Blackshear and lost the world title.

She traveled to Cologne, Germany in May 2000 for a bout against Regina Halmich, which she lost. She won four fights after her loss, including two wins over Yolanda Gonzalez.

Later, Gonzales fought in the bantamweight ranks, and in June 2003 lost a fight against Ada Vélez for the WIBA bantamweight title on a seventh-round disqualification. She has also managed boxer Rebecca Rodriguez.

On March 19, 2004, Gonzalez returned to the ring for a 6-round draw with Johanna Peña-Álvarez.

Gonzalez was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2022.

<text>A fingerprint is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger. The recovery of partial fingerprints from a crime scene is an important method of forensic science. Moisture and grease on a finger result in fingerprints on surfaces such as glass or metal. Deliberate impressions of entire fingerprints can be obtained by ink or other substances transferred from the peaks of friction ridges on the skin to a smooth surface such as paper. Fingerprint records normally contain impressions from the pad on the last joint of fingers and thumbs, though fingerprint cards also typically record portions of lower joint areas of the fingers.

Human fingerprints are detailed, unique, difficult to alter, and durable over the life of an individual, making them suitable as long-term markers of human identity. They may be employed by police or other authorities to identify individuals who wish to conceal their identity, or to identify people who are incapacitated or dead and thus unable to identify themselves, as in the aftermath of a natural disaster.

Their use as evidence has been challenged by academics, judges and the media. There are no uniform standards for point-counting methods, and academics have argued that the error rate in matching fingerprints has not been adequately studied and that fingerprint evidence has no secure statistical foundation. Research has been conducted into whether experts can objectively focus on feature information in fingerprints without being misled by extraneous information, such as context.

== Biology ==
Fingerprints are impressions left on surfaces by the friction ridges on the finger of a human. The matching of two fingerprints is among the most widely used and most reliable biometric techniques. Fingerprint matching considers only the obvious features of a fingerprint.

The composition of fingerprints consists of water (95%-99%), as well as organic and inorganic constituents. The organic component is made up of amino acids, proteins, glucose, lactase, urea, pyruvate, fatty acids and sterols. Inorganic ions such as chloride, sodium, potassium and iron are also present. Other contaminants such as oils found in cosmetics, drugs and their metabolites and food residues may be found in fingerprint residues.

A friction ridge is a raised portion of the epidermis on the digits (fingers and toes), the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, consisting of one or more connected ridge units of friction ridge skin. These are sometimes known as &quot;epidermal ridges&quot; which are caused by the underlying interface between the dermal papillae of the dermis and the interpapillary (rete) pegs of the epidermis. These unique features are formed at around the 15th week of fetal development and remain until after death, when decomposition begins. During the development of the fetus, around the 13th week of a pregnancy, ledge-like formation is formed at the bottom of the epidermis beside the dermis. The cells along these ledges begin to rapidly proliferate. This rapid proliferation forms primary and secondary ridges. Both the primary and secondary ridges act as a template for the outer layer of the skin to form the friction ridges seen on the surface of the skin.

These epidermal ridges serve to amplify vibrations triggered, for example, when fingertips brush across an uneven surface, better transmitting the signals to sensory nerves involved in fine texture perception. These ridges may also assist in gripping rough surfaces and may improve surface contact in wet conditions.

== Genetics ==
Consensus within the scientific community suggests that the dermatoglyphic patterns on fingertips are hereditary. The fingerprint patterns between monozygotic twins have been shown to be very similar (though not identical), whereas dizygotic twins have considerably less similarity. Significant heritability has been identified for 12 dermatoglyphic characteristics. Current models of dermatoglyphic trait inheritance suggest Mendelian transmission with additional effects from either additive or dominant major genes.

Whereas genes determine the general characteristics of patterns and their type, the presence of environmental factors result in the slight differentiation of each fingerprint. However, the relative influences of genetic and environmental effects on fingerprint patterns are generally unclear. One study has suggested that roughly 5% of the total variability is due to small environmental effects, although this was only performed using total ridge count as a metric. Several models of finger ridge formation mechanisms that lead to the vast diversity of fingerprints have been proposed. One model suggests that a buckling instability in the basal cell layer of the fetal epidermis is responsible for developing epidermal ridges. Additionally, blood vessels and nerves may also serve a role in the formation of ridge configurations. Another model indicates that changes in amniotic fluid surrounding each developing finger within the uterus cause corresponding cells on each fingerprint to grow in different microenvironments. For a given individual, these various factors affect each finger differently, preventing two fingerprints from being identical while still retaining similar patterns.

It is important to note that the determination of fingerprint inheritance is made difficult by the vast diversity of phenotypes. Classification of a specific pattern is often subjective (lack of consensus on the most appropriate characteristic to measure quantitatively) which complicates analysis of dermatoglyphic patterns. Several modes of inheritance have been suggested and observed for various fingerprint patterns. Total fingerprint ridge count, a commonly used metric of fingerprint pattern size, has been suggested to have a polygenic mode of inheritance and is influenced by multiple additive genes. This hypothesis has been challenged by other research, however, which indicates that ridge counts on individual fingers are genetically independent and lack evidence to support the existence of additive genes influencing pattern formation. Another mode of fingerprint pattern inheritance suggests that the arch pattern on the thumb and on other fingers are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Further research on the arch pattern has suggested that a major gene or multifactorial inheritance is responsible for arch pattern heritability. A separate model for the development of the whorl pattern indicates that a single gene or group of linked genes contributes to its inheritance. Furthermore, inheritance of the whorl pattern does not appear to be symmetric in that the pattern is seemingly randomly distributed among the ten fingers of a given individual. In general, comparison of fingerprint patterns between left and right hands suggests an asymmetry in the effects of genes on fingerprint patterns, although this observation requires further analysis.

In addition to proposed models of inheritance, specific genes have been implicated as factors in fingertip pattern formation (their exact mechanism of influencing patterns is still under research). Multivariate linkage analysis of finger ridge counts on individual fingers revealed linkage to chromosome 5q14.1 specifically for the ring, index, and middle fingers. In mice, variants in the gene EVI1 were correlated with dermatoglyphic patterns. EVI1 expression in humans does not directly influence fingerprint patterns but does affect limb and digit formation which in turn may play a role in influencing fingerprint patterns. Genome-wide association studies found single nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene ADAMTS9-AS2 on 3p14.1, which appeared to have an influence on the whorl pattern on all digits. This gene encodes antisense RNA which may inhibit ADAMTS9, which is expressed in the skin. A model of how genetic variants of ADAMTS9-AS2 directly influence whorl development has not yet been proposed.

In February 2023, a study identified WNT, BMP and EDAR as signaling pathways regulating the formation of primary ridges on fingerprints, with the first two having an opposite relationship established by a Turing reaction-diffusion system.

== Classification systems ==


Before computerization, manual filing systems were used in large fingerprint repositories. A fingerprint classification system groups fingerprints according to their characteristics and therefore helps in the matching of a fingerprint against a large database of fingerprints. A query fingerprint that needs to be matched can therefore be compared with a subset of fingerprints in an existing database. Early classification systems were based on the general ridge patterns, including the presence or absence of circular patterns, of several or all fingers. This allowed the filing and retrieval of paper records in large collections based on friction ridge patterns alone. The most popular systems used the pattern class of each finger to form a numeric key to assist lookup in a filing system. Fingerprint classification systems included the Roscher System, the Juan Vucetich System and the Henry Classification System. The Roscher System was developed in Germany and implemented in both Germany and Japan. The Vucetich System was developed in Argentina and implemented throughout South America. The Henry Classification System was developed in India and implemented in most English-speaking countries.

In the Henry Classification System, there are three basic fingerprint patterns: loop, whorl, and arch, which constitute 60–65 percent, 30–35 percent, and 5 percent of all fingerprints respectively. There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches, and into loops that may be radial or ulnar, depending on the side of the hand toward which the tail points. Ulnar loops start on the pinky-side of the finger, the side closer to the ulna, the lower arm bone. Radial loops start on the thumb-side of the finger, the side closer to the radius. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, double loop whorls, peacock&#x27;s eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.

The &quot;primary classification number&quot; in the Henry Classification System is a fraction whose numerator and denominator are whole numbers between 1 and 32 inclusive, thus classifying each set of ten fingerprints into one of 1024 groups. (To distinguish these groups, the fraction is &quot;not&quot; reduced by dividing out any common factors.) The fraction is determined by ten indicators, one for each finger, an indicator taking the value 1 when that finger has a whorl, and 0 otherwise. These indicators can be written 
formula_1 for the right hand and 
formula_2 for the left hand, where the subscripts are &quot;t&quot; for thumb, &quot;i&quot; for index finger, &quot;m&quot; for middle finger, &quot;r&quot; for ring finger and &quot;l&quot; for little finger. The formula for the fraction is then as follows:

formula_3

For example, if only the right ring finger and the left index finger have whorls, then the set of fingerprints is classified into the &quot;9/3&quot; group:

formula_4

Note that although 9/3 = 3/1, the &quot;9/3&quot; group is different from the &quot;3/1&quot; group, as the latter corresponds to having whorls only on the left middle finger.

== Fingerprint identification ==
Fingerprint identification, known as dactyloscopy, ridgeology, or hand print identification, is the process of comparing two instances of friction ridge skin impressions (see minutiae), from human fingers or toes, or even the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, to determine whether these impressions could have come from the same individual. The flexibility and the randomized formation of the friction ridges on skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same hand may be slightly different. Fingerprint identification, also referred to as individualization, involves an expert, or an expert computer system operating under threshold scoring rules, determining whether two friction ridge impressions are likely to have originated from the same finger or palm (or toe or sole).

In 2024, research using deep learning neural networks found contrary to &quot;prevailing assumptions&quot; that fingerprints from different fingers of the same person could be identified as belonging to that individual with 99.99% confidence. Further, features used in traditional methods were nonpredictive in such identification while ridge orientation, particularly near the center of the fingerprint center provided most information. 

An intentional recording of friction ridges is usually made with black printer&#x27;s ink rolled across a contrasting white background, typically a white card. Friction ridges can also be recorded digitally, usually on a glass plate, using a technique called live scan. A &quot;latent print&quot; is the chance recording of friction ridges deposited on the surface of an object or a wall. Latent prints are invisible to the naked eye, whereas &quot;patent prints&quot; or &quot;plastic prints&quot; are viewable with the unaided eye. Latent prints are often fragmentary and require the use of chemical methods, powder, or alternative light sources in order to be made clear. Sometimes an ordinary bright flashlight will make a latent print visible.

When friction ridges come into contact with a surface that will take a print, material that is on the friction ridges such as perspiration, oil, grease, ink, or blood, will be transferred to the surface. Factors which affect the quality of friction ridge impressions are numerous. Pliability of the skin, deposition pressure, slippage, the material from which the surface is made, the roughness of the surface, and the substance deposited are just some of the various factors which can cause a latent print to appear differently from any known recording of the same friction ridges. Indeed, the conditions surrounding every instance of friction ridge deposition are unique and never duplicated. For these reasons, fingerprint examiners are required to undergo extensive training. The scientific study of fingerprints is called dermatoglyphics or dactylography.

== Fingerprinting techniques ==
=== Exemplar ===
Exemplar prints, or known prints, is the name given to fingerprints deliberately collected from a subject, whether for purposes of enrollment in a system or when under arrest for a suspected criminal offense. During criminal arrests, a set of exemplar prints will normally include one print taken from each finger that has been rolled from one edge of the nail to the other, plain (or slap) impressions of each of the four fingers of each hand, and plain impressions of each thumb. Exemplar prints can be collected using live scan or by using ink on paper cards.

=== Latent ===
In forensic science, a partial fingerprint lifted from a surface is called a &quot;latent fingerprint&quot;. Moisture and grease on fingers result in latent fingerprints on surfaces such as glass. But because they are not clearly visible, their detection may require chemical development through powder dusting, the spraying of ninhydrin, iodine fuming, or soaking in silver nitrate. Depending on the surface or the material on which a latent fingerprint has been found, different methods of chemical development must be used. Forensic scientists use different techniques for porous surfaces, such as paper, and nonporous surfaces, such as glass, metal or plastic. Nonporous surfaces require the dusting process, where fine powder and a brush are used, followed by the application of transparent tape to lift the latent fingerprint off the surface.

While the police often describe all partial fingerprints found at a crime scene as latent prints, forensic scientists call partial fingerprints that are readily visible &quot;patent prints&quot;. Chocolate, toner, paint or ink on fingers will result in patent fingerprints. Latent fingerprints impressions that are found on soft material, such as soap, cement or plaster, are called &quot;plastic prints&quot; by forensic scientists.

== Capture and detection ==

=== Live scan devices ===

Fingerprint image acquisition is considered to be the most critical step in an automated fingerprint authentication system, as it determines the final fingerprint image quality, which has a drastic effect on the overall system performance. There are different types of fingerprint readers on the market, but the basic idea behind each is to measure the physical difference between ridges and valleys.

All the proposed methods can be grouped into two major families: solid-state fingerprint readers and optical fingerprint readers. The procedure for capturing a fingerprint using a sensor consists of rolling or touching with the finger onto a sensing area, which according to the physical principle in use (optical, ultrasonic, capacitive, or thermalsee ) captures the difference between valleys and ridges. When a finger touches or rolls onto a surface, the elastic skin deforms. The quantity and direction of the pressure applied by the user, the skin conditions and the projection of an irregular 3D object (the finger) onto a 2D flat plane introduce distortions, noise, and inconsistencies in the captured fingerprint image. These problems result in inconsistent and non-uniform irregularities in the image. During each acquisition, therefore, the results of the imaging are different and uncontrollable. The representation of the same fingerprint changes every time the finger is placed on the sensor plate, increasing the complexity of any attempt to match fingerprints, impairing the system performance and consequently, limiting the widespread use of this biometric technology.

In order to overcome these problems, as of 2010, non-contact or touchless 3D fingerprint scanners have been developed. Acquiring detailed 3D information, 3D fingerprint scanners take a digital approach to the analog process of pressing or rolling the finger. By modelling the distance between neighboring points, the fingerprint can be imaged at a resolution high enough to record all the necessary detail.

=== Fingerprinting on cadavers ===
The human skin itself, which is a regenerating organ until death, and environmental factors such as lotions and cosmetics, pose challenges when fingerprinting a human. Following the death of a human, the skin dries and cools. Fingerprints of dead humans may be obtained during an autopsy.

The collection of fingerprints off of a cadaver can be done in varying ways and depends on the condition of the skin. In the case of cadaver in the later stages of decomposition with dried skin, analysts will boil the skin to recondition/rehydrate it, allowing for moisture to flow back into the skin and resulting in detail friction ridges. Another method that has been used in brushing a powder, such as baby powder over the tips of the fingers. The powder will embed itself into the furrows of the friction ridges, allowing the lifted ridges to be seen.

=== Latent fingerprint detection ===
In the 1930s, criminal investigators in the United States first discovered the existence of latent fingerprints on the surfaces of fabrics, most notably on the insides of gloves discarded by perpetrators.

Since the late nineteenth century, fingerprint identification methods have been used by police agencies around the world to identify suspected criminals as well as the victims of crime. The basis of the traditional fingerprinting technique is simple. The skin on the palmar surface of the hands and feet forms ridges, so-called papillary ridges, in patterns that are unique to each individual and which do not change over time. Even identical twins (who share their DNA) do not have identical fingerprints. The best way to render latent fingerprints visible, so that they can be photographed, can be complex and may depend, for example, on the type of surfaces on which they have been left. It is generally necessary to use a &quot;developer&quot;, usually a powder or chemical reagent, to produce a high degree of visual contrast between the ridge patterns and the surface on which a fingerprint has been deposited.

Developing agents depend on the presence of organic materials or inorganic salts for their effectiveness, although the water deposited may also take a key role. Fingerprints are typically formed from the aqueous-based secretions of the eccrine glands of the fingers and palms with additional material from sebaceous glands primarily from the forehead. This latter contamination results from the common human behaviors of touching the face and hair. The resulting latent fingerprints consist usually of a substantial proportion of water with small traces of amino acids and chlorides mixed with a fatty, sebaceous component which contains a number of fatty acids and triglycerides. Detection of a small proportion of reactive organic substances such as urea and amino acids is far from easy.

Fingerprints at a crime scene may be detected by simple powders, or by chemicals applied &quot;in situ&quot;. More complex techniques, usually involving chemicals, can be applied in specialist laboratories to appropriate articles removed from a crime scene. With advances in these more sophisticated techniques, some of the more advanced crime scene investigation services from around the world were, as of 2010, reporting that 50% or more of the fingerprints recovered from a crime scene had been identified as a result of laboratory-based techniques.

== Forensic laboratories ==
Although there are hundreds of reported techniques for fingerprint detection, many of these are only of academic interest and there are only around 20 really effective methods which are currently in use in the more advanced fingerprint laboratories around the world.

Some of these techniques, such as ninhydrin, diazafluorenone and vacuum metal deposition, show great sensitivity and are used operationally. Some fingerprint reagents are specific, for example ninhydrin or diazafluorenone reacting with amino acids. Others such as ethyl cyanoacrylate polymerisation, work apparently by water-based catalysis and polymer growth. Vacuum metal deposition using gold and zinc has been shown to be non-specific, but can detect fat layers as thin as one molecule.

More mundane methods, such as the application of fine powders, work by adhesion to sebaceous deposits and possibly aqueous deposits in the case of fresh fingerprints. The aqueous component of a fingerprint, while initially sometimes making up over 90% of the weight of the fingerprint, can evaporate quite quickly and may have mostly gone after 24 hours. Following work on the use of argon ion lasers for fingerprint detection, a wide range of fluorescence techniques have been introduced, primarily for the enhancement of chemically developed fingerprints; the inherent fluorescence of some latent fingerprints may also be detected. Fingerprints can for example be visualized in 3D and without chemicals by the use of infrared lasers.

A comprehensive manual of the operational methods of fingerprint enhancement was last published by the UK Home Office Scientific Development Branch in 2013 and is used widely around the world.

A technique proposed in 2007 aims to identify an individual&#x27;s ethnicity, sex, and dietary patterns.

== Limitations and implications in a forensic context ==
One of the main limitations of friction ridge impression evidence regarding the actual collection would be the surface environment, specifically talking about how porous the surface the impression is on. With non-porous surfaces, the residues of the impression will not be absorbed into the material of the surface, but could be smudged by another surface. With porous surfaces, the residues of the impression will be absorbed into the surface. With both resulting in either an impression of no value to examiners or the destruction of the friction ridge impressions.

In order for analysts to correctly positively identify friction ridge patterns and their features depends heavily on the clarity of the impression. Therefore, the analysis of friction ridges is limited by clarity.

In a court context, many have argued that friction ridge identification and ridgeology should be classified as opinion evidence and not as fact, therefore should be assessed as such. Many have said that friction ridge identification is only legally admissible today because during the time when it was added to the legal system, the admissibility standards were quite low. There are only a limited number of studies that have been conducted to help confirm the science behind this identification process.

== Crime scene investigations ==


The application of the new scanning Kelvin probe (SKP) fingerprinting technique, which makes no physical contact with the fingerprint and does not require the use of developers, has the potential to allow fingerprints to be recorded while still leaving intact material that could subsequently be subjected to DNA analysis. A forensically usable prototype was under development at Swansea University during 2010, in research that was generating significant interest from the British Home Office and a number of different police forces across the UK, as well as internationally. The hope is that this instrument could eventually be manufactured in sufficiently large numbers to be widely used by forensic teams worldwide.

== Detection of drug use ==
The secretions, skin oils and dead cells in a human fingerprint contain residues of various chemicals and their metabolites present in the body. These can be detected and used for forensic purposes. For example, the fingerprints of tobacco smokers contain traces of cotinine, a nicotine metabolite; they also contain traces of nicotine itself. Caution should be used, as its presence may be caused by mere contact of the finger with a tobacco product. By treating the fingerprint with gold nanoparticles with attached cotinine antibodies, and then subsequently with a fluorescent agent attached to cotinine antibodies, the fingerprint of a smoker becomes fluorescent; non-smokers&#x27; fingerprints stay dark. The same approach, as of 2010, is being tested for use in identifying heavy coffee drinkers, cannabis smokers, and users of various other drugs.

== Police force databases ==

Most American law enforcement agencies use Wavelet Scalar Quantization (WSQ), a wavelet-based system for efficient storage of compressed fingerprint images at 500 pixels per inch (ppi). WSQ was developed by the FBI, the Los Alamos National Lab, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). For fingerprints recorded at 1000 ppi spatial resolution, law enforcement (including the FBI) uses JPEG 2000 instead of WSQ.

== Validity ==

Fingerprints collected at a crime scene, or on items of evidence from a crime, have been used in forensic science to identify suspects, victims and other persons who touched a surface. Fingerprint identification emerged as an important system within police agencies in the late 19th century, when it replaced anthropometric measurements as a more reliable method for identifying persons having a prior record, often under a false name, in a criminal record repository. Fingerprinting has served all governments worldwide during the past 100 years or so to provide identification of criminals. Fingerprints are the fundamental tool in every police agency for the identification of people with a criminal history.

The validity of forensic fingerprint evidence has been challenged by academics, judges and the media. In the United States fingerprint examiners have not developed uniform standards for the identification of an individual based on matching fingerprints. In some countries where fingerprints are also used in criminal investigations, fingerprint examiners are required to match a number of &quot;identification points&quot; before a match is accepted. In England 16 identification points are required and in France 12, to match two fingerprints and identify an individual. Point-counting methods have been challenged by some fingerprint examiners because they focus solely on the location of particular characteristics in fingerprints that are to be matched. Fingerprint examiners may also uphold the &quot;one dissimilarity doctrine&quot;, which holds that if there is one dissimilarity between two fingerprints, the fingerprints are not from the same finger. Furthermore, academics have argued that the error rate in matching fingerprints has not been adequately studied and it has even been argued that fingerprint evidence has no secure statistical foundation. Research has been conducted into whether experts can objectively focus on feature information in fingerprints without being misled by extraneous information, such as context.

Fingerprints can theoretically be forged and planted at crime scenes.

== Professional certification ==
Fingerprinting was the basis upon which the first forensic professional organization was formed, the International Association for Identification (IAI), in 1915. The first professional certification program for forensic scientists was established in 1977, the IAI&#x27;s Certified Latent Print Examiner program, which issued certificates to those meeting stringent criteria and had the power to revoke certification where an individual&#x27;s performance warranted it. Other forensic disciplines have followed suit and established their own certification programs.

== History ==

=== Antiquity and the medieval period ===
Fingerprints have been found on ancient clay tablets, seals, and pottery. They have also been found on the walls of Egyptian tombs and on Minoan, Greek, and Chinese pottery. In ancient China officials authenticated government documents with their fingerprints. In about 200 BC, fingerprints were used to sign written contracts in Babylon. Fingerprints from 3D-scans of cuneiform tablets are extracted using the GigaMesh Software Framework.

With the advent of silk and paper in China, parties to a legal contract impressed their handprints on the document. Sometime before 851 CE, an Arab merchant in China, Abu Zayd Hasan, witnessed Chinese merchants using fingerprints to authenticate loans.

References from the age of the Babylonian king Hammurabi (reigned 1792–1750 BCE) indicate that law officials would take the fingerprints of people who had been arrested. During China&#x27;s Qin dynasty, records have shown that officials took hand prints and foot prints as well as fingerprints as evidence from a crime scene. In 650, the Chinese historian Kia Kung-Yen remarked that fingerprints could be used as a means of authentication. In his &quot;Jami al-Tawarikh&quot; (Universal History), the Iranian physician Rashid-al-Din Hamadani (1247–1318) refers to the Chinese practice of identifying people via their fingerprints, commenting: &quot;Experience shows that no two individuals have fingers exactly alike.&quot;
Whether these examples indicate that ancient peoples realized that fingerprints could uniquely identify individuals has been debated, with some arguing these examples are no more meaningful than an illiterate&#x27;s mark on a document or an accidental remnant akin to a potter&#x27;s mark on their clay.

=== Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries ===
From the late 16th century onwards, European academics attempted to include fingerprints in scientific studies. But plausible conclusions could be established only from the mid-17th century onwards. In 1686, the professor of anatomy at the University of Bologna Marcello Malpighi identified ridges, spirals and loops in fingerprints left on surfaces. In 1788, a German anatomist Johann Christoph Andreas Mayer was the first European to conclude that fingerprints were unique to each individual.

=== 19th century ===

In 1823, Jan Evangelista Purkyně identified nine fingerprint patterns. The nine patterns include the tented arch, the loop, and the whorl, which in modern-day forensics are considered ridge details. In 1840, following the murder of Lord William Russell, a provincial doctor, Robert Blake Overton, wrote to Scotland Yard suggesting checking for fingerprints. In 1853, the German anatomist Georg von Meissner (1829–1905) studied friction ridges, and in 1858, Sir William James Herschel initiated fingerprinting in India. In 1877, he first instituted the use of fingerprints on contracts and deeds to prevent the repudiation of signatures in Hooghly near Kolkata and he registered government pensioners&#x27; fingerprints to prevent the collection of money by relatives after a pensioner&#x27;s death.

In 1880, Henry Faulds, a Scottish surgeon in a Tokyo hospital, published his first paper on the usefulness of fingerprints for identification and proposed a method to record them with printing ink. Henry Faulds also suggested, based on his studies, that fingerprints are unique to a human. Returning to Great Britain in 1886, he offered the concept to the Metropolitan Police in London but it was dismissed at that time. Up until the early 1890s, police forces in the United States and on the European continent could not reliably identify criminals to track their criminal record. Francis Galton published a detailed statistical model of fingerprint analysis and identification in his 1892 book &quot;Finger Prints&quot;. He had calculated that the chance of a &quot;false positive&quot; (two different individuals having the same fingerprints) was about 1 in 64 billion. In 1892, Juan Vucetich, an Argentine chief police officer, created the first method of recording the fingerprints of individuals on file. In that same year, Francisca Rojas was found in a house with neck injuries, while her two sons were found dead with their throats cut. Rojas accused a neighbour, but despite brutal interrogation, this neighbour would not confess to the crimes. Inspector Álvarez, a colleague of Vucetich, went to the scene and found a bloody thumb mark on a door. When it was compared with Rojas&#x27; prints, it was found to be identical with her right thumb. She then confessed to the murder of her sons. This was the first known murder case to be solved using fingerprint analysis.

In Kolkata, a fingerprint Bureau was established in 1897, after the Council of the Governor General approved a committee report that fingerprints should be used for the classification of criminal records. The bureau employees Azizul Haque and Hem Chandra Bose have been credited with the primary development of a fingerprint classification system eventually named after their supervisor, Sir Edward Richard Henry.

=== 20th century ===
The French scientist Paul-Jean Coulier developed a method to transfer latent fingerprints on surfaces to paper using iodine fuming. It allowed the London Scotland Yard to start fingerprinting individuals and identify criminals using fingerprints in 1901. Soon after, American police departments adopted the same method and fingerprint identification became a standard practice in the United States. The Scheffer case of 1902 is the first case of the identification, arrest, and conviction of a murderer based upon fingerprint evidence. Alphonse Bertillon identified the thief and murderer Scheffer, who had previously been arrested and his fingerprints filed some months before, from the fingerprints found on a fractured glass showcase, after a theft in a dentist&#x27;s apartment where the dentist&#x27;s employee was found dead. It was able to be proved in court that the fingerprints had been made after the showcase was broken.

The identification of individuals through fingerprints for law enforcement has been considered essential in the United States since the beginning of the 20th century. Body identification using fingerprints has also been valuable in the aftermath of natural disasters and anthropogenic hazards. In the United States, the FBI manages a fingerprint identification system and database called the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), which currently holds the fingerprints and criminal records of over 51 million criminal record subjects and over 1.5 million civil (non-criminal) fingerprint records. OBIM, formerly U.S. VISIT, holds the largest repository of biometric identifiers in the U.S. government at over 260 million individual identities. When it was deployed in 2004, this repository, known as the Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT), stored biometric data in the form of two-finger records. Between 2005 and 2009, the DHS transitioned to a ten-print record standard in order to establish interoperability with IAFIS.
In 1910, Edmond Locard established the first forensic lab in France. Criminals may wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting glove prints, law enforcement can match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence or to prints collected at other crime scenes. In many jurisdictions the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an inchoate offense.

== Use of fingerprints in schools ==

The non-governmental organization (NGO) Privacy International in 2002 made the cautionary announcement that tens of thousands of UK school children were being fingerprinted by schools, often without the knowledge or consent of their parents. That same year, the supplier Micro Librarian Systems, which uses a technology similar to that used in US prisons and the German military, estimated that 350 schools throughout Britain were using such systems to replace library cards. By 2007, it was estimated that 3,500 schools were using such systems. Under the United Kingdom Data Protection Act, schools in the UK do not have to ask parental consent to allow such practices to take place. Parents opposed to fingerprinting may bring only individual complaints against schools. In response to a complaint which they are continuing to pursue, in 2010, the European Commission expressed &#x27;significant concerns&#x27; over the proportionality and necessity of the practice and the lack of judicial redress, indicating that the practice may break the European Union data protection directive.

In March 2007, the UK government was considering fingerprinting all children aged 11 to 15 and adding the prints to a government database as part of a new passport and ID card scheme and disallowing opposition for privacy concerns. All fingerprints taken would be cross-checked against prints from 900,000 unsolved crimes. Shadow Home secretary David Davis called the plan &quot;sinister&quot;. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Nick Clegg criticised &quot;the determination to build a surveillance state behind the backs of the British people&quot;. The UK&#x27;s junior education minister Lord Adonis defended the use of fingerprints by schools, to track school attendance as well as access to school meals and libraries, and reassured the House of Lords that the children&#x27;s fingerprints had been taken with the consent of the parents and would be destroyed once children left the school. An Early Day Motion which called on the UK Government to conduct a full and open consultation with stakeholders about the use of biometrics in schools, secured the support of 85 Members of Parliament (Early Day Motion 686). Following the establishment in the United Kingdom of a Conservative and Liberal Democratic coalition government in May 2010, the UK ID card scheme was scrapped.

Serious concerns about the security implications of using conventional biometric templates in schools have been raised by a number of leading IT security experts, one of whom has voiced the opinion that &quot;it is absolutely premature to begin using &#x27;conventional biometrics&#x27; in schools&quot;. The vendors of biometric systems claim that their products bring benefits to schools such as improved reading skills, decreased wait times in lunch lines and increased revenues. They do not cite independent research to support this view. One education specialist wrote in 2007: &quot;I have not been able to find a single piece of published research which suggests that the use of biometrics in schools promotes healthy eating or improves reading skills amongst children... There is absolutely no evidence for such claims&quot;.

The Ottawa Police in Canada have advised parents who fear their children may be kidnapped to fingerprint their children.

== Absence or mutilation of fingerprints ==
A very rare medical condition, adermatoglyphia, is characterized by the absence of fingerprints. Affected persons have completely smooth fingertips, palms, toes and soles, but no other medical signs or symptoms. A 2011 study indicated that adermatoglyphia is caused by the improper expression of the protein SMARCAD1. The condition has been called &quot;immigration delay disease&quot; by the researchers describing it, because the congenital lack of fingerprints causes delays when affected persons attempt to prove their identity while traveling. Only five families with this condition had been described as of 2011.

People with Naegeli–Franceschetti–Jadassohn syndrome and dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis, which are both forms of ectodermal dysplasia, also have no fingerprints. Both of these rare genetic syndromes produce other signs and symptoms as well, such as thin, brittle hair.

The anti-cancer medication capecitabine may cause the loss of fingerprints. Swelling of the fingers, such as that caused by bee stings, will in some cases cause the temporary disappearance of fingerprints, though they will return when the swelling recedes.

Since the elasticity of skin decreases with age, many senior citizens have fingerprints that are difficult to capture. The ridges get thicker; the height between the top of the ridge and the bottom of the furrow gets narrow, so there is less prominence.

Fingerprints can be erased permanently and this can potentially be used by criminals to reduce their chance of conviction. Erasure can be achieved in a variety of ways including simply burning the fingertips, using acids and advanced techniques such as plastic surgery. John Dillinger burned his fingers with acid, but prints taken during a previous arrest and upon death still exhibited almost complete relation to one another.

== Fingerprint verification ==

Fingerprints can be captured as graphical ridge and valley patterns. Because of their uniqueness and permanence, fingerprints emerged as the most widely used biometric identifier in the 2000s. Automated fingerprint verification systems were developed to meet the needs of law enforcement and their use became more widespread in civilian applications. Despite being deployed more widely, reliable automated fingerprint verification remained a challenge and was extensively researched in the context of pattern recognition and image processing. The uniqueness of a fingerprint can be established by the overall pattern of ridges and valleys, or the logical ridge discontinuities known as minutiae. In the 2000s, minutiae features were considered the most discriminating and reliable feature of a fingerprint. Therefore, the recognition of minutiae features became the most common basis for automated fingerprint verification. The most widely used minutiae features used for automated fingerprint verification were the ridge ending and the ridge bifurcation.

=== Patterns ===
The three basic patterns of fingerprint ridges are the arch, loop, and whorl:
* Arch: The ridges enter from one side of the finger, rise in the center forming an arc, and then exit the other side of the finger.
* Loop: The ridges enter from one side of a finger, form a curve, and then exit on that same side.
* Whorl: Ridges form circularly around a central point on the finger.
Scientists have found that family members often share the same general fingerprint patterns, leading to the belief that these patterns are inherited.

=== Fingerprint features ===
Features of fingerprint ridges, called &quot;minutiae&quot;, include:
* Ridge ending: The abrupt end of a ridge
* Bifurcation: A single ridge dividing in two
* Short or independent ridge: A ridge that commences, travels a short distance and then ends
* Island or dot: A single small ridge inside a short ridge or ridge ending that is not connected to all other ridges
* Lake or ridge enclosure: A single ridge that bifurcates and reunites shortly afterward to continue as a single ridge
* Spur: A bifurcation with a short ridge branching off a longer ridge
* Bridge or crossover: A short ridge that runs between two parallel ridges
* Delta: A Y-shaped ridge meeting
* Core: A circle in the ridge pattern


== Fingerprint sensors ==

A fingerprint sensor is an electronic device used to capture a digital image of the fingerprint pattern. The captured image is called a live scan. This live scan is digitally processed to create a biometric template (a collection of extracted features) which is stored and used for matching. Many technologies have been used including optical, capacitive, RF, thermal, piezoresistive, ultrasonic, piezoelectric, and MEMS.
* Optical scanners take a visual image of the fingerprint using a digital camera.
* Capacitive or CMOS scanners use capacitors and thus electric current to form an image of the fingerprint.
* Ultrasound fingerprint scanners use high frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal (outer) layer of the skin.
* Thermal scanners sense the temperature differences on the contact surface, in between fingerprint ridges and valleys.

=== Consumer electronics login authentication ===

Since 2000, electronic fingerprint readers have been introduced as consumer electronics security applications. Fingerprint scanners could be used for login authentication and the identification of computer users. However, some less sophisticated sensors have been discovered to be vulnerable to quite simple methods of deception, such as fake fingerprints cast in gels. In 2006, fingerprint sensors gained popularity in the laptop market. Built-in sensors in laptops, such as ThinkPad, VAIO, HP Pavilion and EliteBook laptops, and others also double as motion detectors for document scrolling, like the scroll wheel.

Two of the first smartphone manufacturers to integrate fingerprint recognition into their phones were Motorola with the Atrix 4G in 2011 and Apple with the iPhone 5S on September 10, 2013. One month after, HTC launched the One Max, which also included fingerprint recognition. In April 2014, Samsung released the Galaxy S5, which integrated a fingerprint sensor on the home button.

Following the release of the iPhone 5S model, a group of German hackers announced on September 21, 2013, that they had bypassed Apple&#x27;s new Touch ID fingerprint sensor by photographing a fingerprint from a glass surface and using that captured image as verification. The spokesman for the group stated: &quot;We hope that this finally puts to rest the illusions people have about fingerprint biometrics. It is plain stupid to use something that you can&#x27;t change and that you leave everywhere every day as a security token.&quot; In September 2015, Apple included a new version of the fingerprint scanner in the iPhone home button with the iPhone 6S. The use of the Touch ID fingerprint scanner was optional and could be configured to unlock the screen or pay for mobile apps purchases. Since December 2015, cheaper smartphones with fingerprint recognition have been released, such as the $100 UMI Fair. Samsung introduced fingerprint sensors to its mid-range A series smartphones in 2014.

By 2017, Hewlett Packard, Asus, Huawei, Lenovo and Apple were using fingerprint readers in their laptops. Synaptics says the SecurePad sensor is now available for OEMs to start building into their laptops. In 2018, Synaptics revealed that their in-display fingerprint sensors would be featured on the new Vivo X21 UD smartphone. This was the first mass-produced fingerprint sensor to be integrated into the entire touchscreen display, rather than as a separate sensor.

== Algorithms ==
Matching algorithms are used to compare previously stored templates of fingerprints against candidate fingerprints for authentication purposes. In order to do this either the original image must be directly compared with the candidate image or certain features must be compared.

=== Pre-processing ===
Pre-processing enhances the quality of an image by filtering and removing extraneous noise. The minutiae-based algorithm is only effective with 8-bit gray scale fingerprint images. One reason for this is that an 8-bit gray fingerprint image is a fundamental base when converting the image to a 1-bit image with value 1 for ridges and value 0 for furrows. This process allows for enhanced edge detection so the fingerprint is revealed in high contrast, with the ridges highlighted in black and the furrows in white. To further optimize the input image&#x27;s quality, two more steps are required: minutiae extraction and false minutiae removal. The minutiae extraction is carried out by applying a ridge-thinning algorithm that removes redundant pixels of ridges. As a result, the thinned ridges of the fingerprint image are marked with a unique ID to facilitate the conduction of further operations. After the minutiae extraction, the false minutiae removal is carried out. The lack of the amount of ink and the cross link among the ridges could cause false minutiae that led to inaccuracy in fingerprint recognition process.

=== Pattern-based (or image-based) algorithms ===
Pattern based algorithms compare the basic fingerprint patterns (arch, whorl, and loop) between a previously stored template and a candidate fingerprint. This requires that the images can be aligned in the same orientation. To do this, the algorithm finds a central point in the fingerprint image and centers on that. In a pattern-based algorithm, the template contains the type, size, and orientation of patterns within the aligned fingerprint image. The candidate fingerprint image is graphically compared with the template to determine the degree to which they match.

== In other species ==
Some other animals have evolved their own unique prints, especially those whose lifestyle involves climbing or grasping wet objects; these include many primates, such as gorillas and chimpanzees, Australian koalas, and aquatic mammal species such as the North American fisher. According to one study, even with an electron microscope, it can be quite difficult to distinguish between the fingerprints of a koala and a human.

== In fiction ==

=== Mark Twain ===
Mark Twain&#x27;s memoir &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; (1883), notable mainly for its account of the author&#x27;s time on the river, also recounts parts of his later life and includes tall tales and stories allegedly told to him. Among them is an involved, melodramatic account of a murder in which the killer is identified by a thumbprint. Twain&#x27;s novel &quot;Pudd&#x27;nhead Wilson&quot;, published in 1893, includes a courtroom drama that turns on fingerprint identification.

=== Crime fiction ===
The use of fingerprints in crime fiction has, of course, kept pace with its use in real-life detection. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a short story about his celebrated sleuth Sherlock Holmes which features a fingerprint: &quot;The Norwood Builder&quot; is a 1903 short story set in 1894 and involves the discovery of a bloody fingerprint which helps Holmes to expose the real criminal and free his client.

The British detective writer R. Austin Freeman&#x27;s first Thorndyke novel &quot;The Red Thumb-Mark&quot; was published in 1907 and features a bloody fingerprint left on a piece of paper together with a parcel of diamonds inside a safe-box. These become the center of a medico-legal investigation led by Dr. Thorndyke, who defends the accused whose fingerprint matches that on the paper, after the diamonds are stolen.

=== Film and television ===
In the television series &quot;Bonanza&quot; (1959–1973), the Chinese character Hop Sing uses his knowledge of fingerprints to free Little Joe from a murder charge.

The 1997 movie &quot;Men in Black&quot; required Agent J to remove his ten fingerprints by putting his hands on a metal ball, an action deemed necessary by the MIB agency to remove the identity of its agents.

In the 2009 science fiction movie &quot;Cold Souls&quot;, a mule who smuggles souls wears latex fingerprints to frustrate airport security terminals. She can change her identity by simply changing her wig and latex fingerprints.

<text>Jean Dorothy Seberg (; ; November 13, 1938August 30, 1979) was an American actress. She is considered an icon of the French New Wave as a result of her performance in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Breathless&quot;.

Seberg appeared in 34 films in the United States and Europe, including &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot;, &quot;Lilith&quot;, &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot;, &quot;Breathless&quot;, &quot;Moment to Moment&quot;, &quot;A Fine Madness&quot;, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, &quot;Airport&quot;, &quot;Macho Callahan&quot;, and &quot;Gang War in Naples&quot;. Seberg was among the best-known targets of the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO project. Her targeting was in retaliation for her support of the Black Panther Party, a smear directly ordered by J. Edgar Hoover.

Seberg died at the age of 40 in Paris, the French police ruling her death a probable suicide. Seberg&#x27;s second ex-husband, Romain Gary, called a press conference shortly after her body was found, at which he blamed the FBI&#x27;s campaign against Seberg for her mental demise. Gary mentioned how the FBI had planted false rumors in the media that Seberg&#x27;s pregnancy by Carlos Navarra in 1970 was by a Black Panther, and how the trauma had resulted in her overdosing on sleeping pills while pregnant. Gary stated that Seberg had attempted suicide on numerous anniversaries of the infant&#x27;s death, August 25. At the time of her death, Seberg was separated – though not divorced – from third husband Dennis Berry.

==Early life==
Seberg was born in Marshalltown, Iowa, the daughter of Dorothy Arline (née Benson), a substitute teacher, and Edward Waldemar Seberg, a pharmacist. Her family was Lutheran and of Swedish, English, and German ancestry. Seberg had a sister, Mary-Ann, and two brothers, Kurt and David, the younger of whom was killed in a car accident at the age of 18 in 1968.

Her paternal grandfather, Edward Carlson, arrived in the U.S. in 1882 and observed, &quot;there are too many Carlsons in the New World.&quot; He changed the family surname to Seberg in memory of the water and mountains of Sweden.

In Marshalltown, Seberg babysat Mary Supinger, some eight years her junior, who became stage and film actress Mary Beth Hurt. After high school, Seberg enrolled at the University of Iowa to study dramatic arts but took up filmmaking instead.

Seberg made her film debut in the title role of Joan of Arc in &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1957), based on the George Bernard Shaw play, having been chosen from among 18,000 hopefuls by director Otto Preminger in a $150,000 talent search. Her name was entered by a neighbor.

When she was cast on October 21, 1956, Seberg&#x27;s only acting experience had been a single season of summer stock performances. The film generated a great deal of publicity, but Seberg commented that she was &quot;embarrassed by all the attention.&quot; Despite great hype, called in the press a &quot;&quot;Pygmalion&quot; experiment&quot;, both the film and Seberg received poor reviews. On the failure, she later told the press:I am the greatest example of a very real fact, that all the publicity in the world will not make you a movie star if you are not also an actress.She also recounted:

I have two memories of &quot;Saint Joan&quot;. The first was being burned at the stake in the picture. The second was being burned at the stake by the critics. The latter hurt more. I was scared like a rabbit and it showed on the screen. It was not a good experience at all. I started where most actresses end up.

Preminger promised her a second chance, and he cast Seberg in his next film, &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; (1958), which was filmed in France. Preminger told the press: &quot;It&#x27;s quite true that, if I had chosen Audrey Hepburn instead of Jean Seberg, it would have been less of a risk, but I prefer to take the risk. [..] I have faith in her. Sure, she still has things to learn about acting, but so did Kim Novak when she started.&quot; Seberg again received negative reviews and the film nearly ended her career.

Seberg renegotiated her contract with Preminger and signed a long-term contract with Columbia Pictures. Preminger had an option to use her on another film, but they never again worked together. Her first Columbia film was the successful comedy &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; (1959), starring Peter Sellers.

Mylène Demongeot recalled in a 2015 filmed interview in Paris: &quot;Otto had high hopes in Jean and &quot;Saint Joan&quot;&#x27;s failure took a toll on him also because there was a 5-films-contract from what I recall. She was extremely sad too about it and when we all arrived on the set of &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; she carried on her shoulders the weight of guilt, she was scared. And with that type of man, of character [Preminger] she shouldn&#x27;t have shown fear, that&#x27;s why I got along with him. I was a supporting role, I didn&#x27;t have the weight of the expected success of the film on my shoulders. I had no apprehension regarding him. When he screamed, I would turn and tell him [sarcastically] &quot;you know, you shouldn&#x27;t screech like that, you gonna get yourself a stroke&quot;. Such words would defuse him. On the contrary, Jean was scared of him so he would take advantage and eventually became very mean to her.&quot;

===&quot;Breathless&quot; and French career===
During the filming of &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot;, Seberg met François Moreuil, the man who was to become her first husband, and she then based herself in France, finally achieving success as the free-love heroine of French New Wave films.

She appeared as the female lead in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (French title: &quot;À bout de souffle&quot;, 1960) as Patricia, co-starring with Jean-Paul Belmondo. The film became an international success and critics praised Seberg&#x27;s performance; film critic and director François Truffaut even hailed her as &quot;the best actress in Europe.&quot; Despite her achievements, Seberg did not identify with her characters or the film plots, saying that she was &quot;making films in France about people [I&#x27;m] not really interested in.&quot; Back in the U.S., she made another film for Columbia, the crime drama &quot;Let No Man Write My Epitaph&quot; (1960).

In France, after appearing in &quot;Time Out for Love&quot; (&quot;Les grandes personnes&quot;, 1961), Seberg took the lead role in Moreuil&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Love Play&quot; (&quot;La Recréation&quot;, also 1961). By that time, Seberg had become estranged from Moreuil, and she recollected that production was &quot;pure hell&quot; and that he &quot;would scream at [her].&quot; She followed with &quot;Five Day Lover&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;amant de cinq jours&quot;, 1962), &quot;Congo vivo&quot; (1962) and &quot;In the French Style&quot; (1963), a French-American film featuring Stanley Baker released through Columbia. She also appeared in the anthology film &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Swindlers&quot; (&quot;Les plus belles escroqueries du monde&quot;, 1963) and &quot;Backfire&quot; (&quot;Échappement libre&quot;, 1964), which reunited her with Jean-Paul Belmondo.

Seberg starred with Warren Beatty in the American film &quot;Lilith&quot; (1964) for Columbia, which prompted the critics to acknowledge Seberg as a serious actress. She returned to France to make romantic crime drama &quot;Diamonds Are Brittle&quot; (&quot;Un milliard dans un billard&quot;, 1965).

===Return to Hollywood===
In the late 1960s, Seberg was increasingly based in Hollywood. &quot;Moment to Moment&quot; (1965) was mostly filmed in Los Angeles; only a small part of the film was shot on the French Cote d&#x27;Azur. In New York City, she acted in the comedy &quot;A Fine Madness&quot; (1966) with Sean Connery and under the direction of Irvin Kershner.

In 1966 and 1967, Seberg played the leading roles in two French films directed by Claude Chabrol and co-starring Maurice Ronet. In February and March 1966, she starred in &quot;Line of Demarcation&quot;, filmed around Dole, Jura, and in May and June 1967, she played the lead role in the French-Italian Eurospy film &quot;The Road to Corinth&quot;, shot in Greece.

After making the crime drama &quot;Pendulum&quot; with George Peppard (1969), Seberg appeared in her only musical film, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; (also 1969), based on Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s stage musical and co-starring Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood. Her singing voice was dubbed by Anita Gordon. Seberg also starred in the ensemble disaster film &quot;Airport&quot; (1970), which drew mixed reviews but was a huge success at the box office.

===Later career===

Seberg acted in the western &quot;Macho Callahan&quot; (1970) and the violent crime drama &quot;Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!&quot; (1971), but both films were failures. In 1972, she appeared in &quot;Gang War in Naples&quot;, which was successful in Europe but not in the United States.
Seberg was François Truffaut&#x27;s first choice for the central role of Julie in &quot;Day for Night&quot; (&quot;La Nuit américaine&quot;, 1973), but after several fruitless attempts to contact her, he gave up and cast British actress Jacqueline Bisset instead.

Seberg&#x27;s last American film appearance was in the TV movie &quot;Mousey&quot; (1974). She remained active during the 1970s in European films, appearing in &quot;White Horses of Summer&quot; (&quot;Bianchi cavalli d&#x27;Agosto&quot;) (1975), &quot;The Big Delirium&quot; (&quot;Le Grand Délire&quot;, 1975, with husband Dennis Berry) and &quot;Die Wildente&quot; (1976, based on Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;).

At the time of Seberg&#x27;s death, she was working on the French film &quot;Operation Leopard&quot; (&quot;La Légion saute sur Kolwezi&quot;, 1980), which was based upon the book by Pierre Sergent. She had filmed scenes in French Guiana and returned to Paris for additional work in September. After her death, the scenes were reshot with actress Mimsy Farmer.

== FBI COINTELPRO operation ==
During the late 1960s, Seberg provided financial support to groups supporting civil rights, such as the NAACP as well as Native American school groups such as the Meskwaki Bucks at the Tama County settlement near her hometown of Marshalltown, for whom she purchased $500 worth of basketball uniforms.

As part of its extended campaign to smear and discredit black liberation and anti-war groups, which began in 1968, the FBI became aware of several gifts Seberg had made to the Black Panther Party, totaling an estimated $10,500 in contributions; these were noted among a list of other celebrities in FBI internal documents later declassified and released to the public under FOIA requests.

The FBI operation against Seberg, directly overseen by J. Edgar Hoover, used COINTELPRO program techniques to harass, intimidate, defame, and discredit her. The FBI&#x27;s stated goal was an unspecified &quot;neutralization&quot; of Seberg with a subsidiary objective to &quot;cause her embarrassment and serve to cheapen her image with the public&quot;, while taking the &quot;usual precautions to avoid identification of the Bureau.&quot; The FBI&#x27;s strategy and modalities can be found in its interoffice memos.

In 1970, the FBI created a false story from a San Francisco-based informant that the child Seberg was carrying was not fathered by her ex-husband Romain Gary, as initially claimed, but by Raymond Hewitt, a member of the Black Panther Party. The story was reported by gossip columnist Joyce Haber of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as a blind item. It was also printed by &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine, in which Seberg was directly named. Seberg went into premature labor and, on August 23, 1970, gave birth to a baby girl. The child died two days later. Seberg held a funeral in her hometown with an open casket that allowed reporters to see the infant&#x27;s white skin to disprove the rumors, though she later acknowledged that a Mexican student revolutionary, Carlos Navarra, was the actual father.

Seberg and Gary later sued &quot;Newsweek&quot; for libel and defamation, asking for $200,000 in damages. She contended that she had become so upset after reading the story that she went into premature labor, which resulted in the death of her daughter. A Paris court ordered &quot;Newsweek&quot; to pay the couple $10,800 in damages, and it ordered &quot;Newsweek&quot; to print the judgment in its publication and eight other newspapers.

The Seberg investigation went far beyond the publication of defamatory articles. According to friends interviewed after her death, she experienced years of aggressive in-person surveillance, amounting to constant stalking, as well as burglaries and other means of intimidation. Newspaper reports say Seberg was well aware of the surveillance. FBI files show that she was wiretapped, and in 1980, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published logs of her Swiss wiretapped phone calls. U.S. surveillance was deployed while she was residing in France and while traveling in Switzerland and Italy. The FBI files reveal that the agency contacted the FBI legal attachés in the U.S. embassies in Paris and Rome and provided files on Seberg to the CIA, Secret Service and military intelligence to assist in monitoring Seberg while she was abroad.

Two weeks after Seberg&#x27;s death in 1979, the FBI admitted what it had done nine years previously. FBI records show that Hoover kept President Richard Nixon informed of FBI activities related to the Seberg case through Nixon&#x27;s domestic affairs chief John Ehrlichman. Attorney General John Mitchell and Deputy Attorney General Richard Kleindienst were also kept informed of FBI activities related to Seberg. At the time of the FBI&#x27;s admission of its activities, Haber was no longer writing a column, having been fired in 1975 for often using unattributed information in her column. Following the FBI&#x27;s admission, Haber said she could not disclose the source of the information from her column and said, &quot;If I were used by the FBI, I didn&#x27;t know it. ... I am certainly shocked to learn that the FBI engaged in planting stories with news people.&quot; This point of view stands in stark contrast to historical analysts of FBI institutional behavior. Researchers Ward Churchill and Jim Vander Wall stated in their book, &quot;The Cointelpro Papers: Documents from the FBI&#x27;s Secret Wars Against Domestic Dissent&quot;, that &quot;There is no indication that Richard Wallace Held [Special Agent-in-Charge of the San Francisco FBI Office 1985-1993] ever considered [Seberg-related FBI activities to be anything other than an extremely successful COINTELPRO operation&quot;

===Possible Hollywood blacklisting===
At the peak of her career, Seberg suddenly stopped acting in Hollywood films. Reportedly, she was not pleased with the roles that she had been offered, some of which, she claimed, bordered on pornography. She was not offered any great Hollywood roles, regardless of their size. Experts on the FBI&#x27;s actions in the COINTELPRO project suggest that Seberg was &quot;effectively blacklisted&quot; from Hollywood films.

===Family reaction to FBI abuse of Seberg===
Seberg&#x27;s father reacted strongly to the story of FBI abuses, stating that &quot;if this is true, why in the dickens didn&#x27;t they just shoot her, instead of having all this travail that&#x27;s gone on. I have this flag in the corner, that I used to put out every morning, and I haven&#x27;t put it out since.&quot;

==Personal life==
On September 5, 1958, at the age of 19, Seberg married François Moreuil, a French lawyer (aged 23) in her native Marshalltown, having met him in France 15 months earlier. They divorced in 1960. Moreuil had ambitions to work in film and directed his estranged wife in &quot;Love Play&quot;. He said that the marriage was &quot;violent&quot; and that Seberg &quot;got married for all the wrong reasons.&quot;

On living in France for a period of time, Seberg said in an interview:

I&#x27;m enjoying it to the fullest extent. I&#x27;ve been tremendously lucky to have gone through this experience at an age where I can still learn. That doesn&#x27;t mean that I will stay here. I&#x27;m in Paris because my work has been here. I&#x27;m not an expatriate. I will go where the work is. The French life has its drawbacks. One of them is the formality. The system seems to be based on saving the maximum of yourself for those nearest you. Perhaps that is better than the other extreme in Hollywood, where people give so much of themselves in public life that they have nothing left over for their families. Still, it is hard for an American to get used to. Often I will get excited over a luncheon table only to have the hostess say discreetly that coffee will be served in the other room. ... I miss that casualness and friendliness of Americans, the kind that makes people smile. I also miss blue jeans, milk shakes, thick steaks and supermarkets.

Despite extended stays in the United States, Seberg remained in Paris for the rest of her life. In 1961 she met French aviator, resistance member, novelist and diplomat Romain Gary, who was 24 years her senior and married to author Lesley Blanch. Seberg gave birth to their son, Alexandre Diego Gary, in Barcelona on July 17, 1962. The child&#x27;s birth and first year of life were hidden, even from close friends and relatives. Gary&#x27;s divorce from Blanch took place on September 5, 1962, and he married Seberg secretly on October 6, 1962, in Corsica.

During her marriage to Gary, Seberg lived in Paris, Greece, Southern France and Majorca. She filed for divorce in September 1968, and the divorce was finalized on July 1, 1970. As of 2009, their son resides in Spain, where he runs a bookstore and oversees his father&#x27;s literary and real-estate holdings.

Seberg reportedly had affairs with co-stars Warren Beatty (&quot;Lilith&quot;), Clint Eastwood (&quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;) and Fabio Testi (&quot;Gang War in Naples&quot;), as well as filmmaker Ricardo Franco. Novelist Carlos Fuentes also claimed to have had an affair with her.

While filming &quot;Macho Callahan&quot; in Durango, Mexico, in the winter of 1969–70, Seberg became romantically involved with a student revolutionary named Carlos Ornelas Navarra. She gave birth to their daughter, Nina Hart Gary, by Caesarean section on August 23, 1970. The baby died two days later on August 25, 1970. Ex-husband Gary assumed responsibility for the pregnancy, but Seberg acknowledged that Navarra was the father. Nina is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Marshalltown.

On March 12, 1972, Seberg married director Dennis Berry. The couple separated in May 1976, but never divorced. Seberg subsequently dated aspiring French filmmaker Jean-Claude Messager, who later spoke to CBS&#x27;s Mike Wallace for a 1981 profile of the actress.

In 1979, while still legally married to her estranged husband Berry, Seberg went through &quot;a form of marriage&quot; to a 19-year-old Algerian named Ahmed Hasni. Hasni persuaded her to sell her second apartment on the Rue du Bac, and he kept the proceeds (reportedly 11 million francs in cash), announcing that he would use the money to open a Barcelona restaurant. The couple departed for Spain, but she was soon back in Paris alone, and went into hiding from Hasni, who she claimed had grievously abused her.

==Death==

On August 30, 1979, Seberg disappeared from her Paris apartment. Hasni told police that the couple had gone to see &quot;Womanlight&quot; and when he awoke the next morning, Seberg was gone. After Seberg went missing, Hasni told police that he had known that she was suicidal for some time. He claimed that she had attempted suicide in July 1979 by jumping in front of a Paris subway train.

On September 8, nine days after her disappearance, Seberg&#x27;s decomposing body was found wrapped in a blanket in the back seat of her Renault, parked close to her apartment in the 16th arrondissement. Police found a bottle of barbiturates, an empty mineral water bottle, and a note written in French by Seberg addressed to her son. It read in part, &quot;Forgive me. I can no longer live with my nerves.&quot; In 1979, her death was ruled a probable suicide by Paris police, but the following year additional charges were filed against persons unknown for &quot;non-assistance of a person in danger.&quot;

Romain Gary, Seberg&#x27;s second husband, called a press conference shortly after her death at which he blamed the FBI&#x27;s campaign against Seberg for her deteriorating mental health. Gary claimed that Seberg &quot;became psychotic&quot; after the media had reported the false story—planted by the FBI—that she was pregnant with a Black Panther&#x27;s child in 1970; Seberg had said in an interview that the story was such a shock to her that she went into early labour, leading to the stillbirth of her child. Gary stated that Seberg had repeatedly attempted suicide on the anniversary of the child&#x27;s death, August 25.

Seberg is interred at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

==Aftermath==
According to FBI documents obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, six days after the discovery of Seberg&#x27;s body, the FBI released documents admitting its defamation of Seberg, while making statements attempting to distance the agency from the practices of the Hoover era. The FBI&#x27;s campaign against Seberg was further explored by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in a front-page article titled &quot;The FBI vs. Jean Seberg.&quot;

Media attention surrounding the FBI&#x27;s abuse of Seberg led to an examination of the case by the Church Committee of the U.S. Senate, which noted that despite the FBI&#x27;s claims of reform, &quot;COINTELPRO activities may continue today under the rubric of investigation.&quot;

In his autobiography, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editor Jim Bellows describes events leading up to the Seberg articles, expressing regret that he had not vetted the articles sufficiently. He echoed this sentiment in subsequent interviews.

In June 1980, Paris police filed charges against &quot;persons unknown&quot; in connection with Seberg&#x27;s death. Police stated that Seberg had such a high amount of alcohol in her system at the time of her death that it would have rendered her comatose and unable to enter her car without assistance, and no alcohol was found in the car. Police theorized that someone was present at the time of Seberg&#x27;s death and failed to seek medical care.

In December 1980, Seberg&#x27;s former husband Romain Gary died by suicide. His suicide note, addressed to his publisher, indicated that he had not killed himself over the loss of Seberg, but because he could no longer produce literary works.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;The Talent Scout&quot; by Romain Gary (1961) features a recognizable portrait of Seberg.

In 1983, a musical based on Seberg&#x27;s life called &quot;Jean Seberg,&quot; by librettist Julian Barry, composer Marvin Hamlisch and lyricist Christopher Adler, was presented at the National Theatre in London.

In 1986, pop singer Madonna recreated Seberg&#x27;s iconic &quot;Breathless&quot; look in her music video for &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach,&quot; sporting a pixie blonde haircut, French striped jersey shirt and black capri pants in the style of Seberg&#x27;s character in &quot;Breathless&quot;.

In 1991, actress Jodie Foster, a fan of Seberg&#x27;s performance in &quot;Breathless&quot;, purchased the film rights to &quot;Played Out: The Jean Seberg Story&quot;, David Richards&#x27; biography of Seberg. Foster was set to produce and star in the film, but the project was canceled two years later.

In 1995, Mark Rappaport created a documentary about Seberg, &quot;From the Journals of Jean Seberg&quot;. Mary Beth Hurt played Seberg in a voiceover. Hurt was born in Marshalltown, Iowa in 1948, attended the same high school as Seberg and was babysat by Seberg.

The plot of the 1998 film &quot;Black Tears&quot;, starring Ariadna Gil, is reportedly inspired by Seberg&#x27;s reported affair with Ricardo Franco.

The 2000 short film &quot;Je t&#x27;aime John Wayne&quot; is a tribute parody of &quot;Breathless&quot;, with Seberg played by Camilla Rutherford.

In 2004, French author Alain Absire published &quot;Jean S.&quot;, a fictionalized biography. Seberg&#x27;s son Alexandre Diego Gary brought a lawsuit, unsuccessfully attempting to stop publication.

Also from 2004, Seberg is recalled in the Divine Comedy song &quot;Absent Friends&quot;: &quot;Little Jean Seberg seemed / So full of life / But in those eyes such troubled dreams / Poor little Jean&quot;.

Since 2011, Seberg&#x27;s hometown of Marshalltown, Iowa, has held an annual Jean Seberg International Film Festival.

In 2019, Amazon released an original film based on Seberg&#x27;s life called &quot;Seberg&quot; that focuses on her battle against the FBI, with the title role played by Kristen Stewart.

The character of Anny Vikland in William Boyd&#x27;s 2020 novel &quot;Trio&quot; strongly resembles Seberg&#x27;s in details of her life and death.

In 2022, Kacey Rohl portrayed Seberg in &quot;White Dog&quot; (&quot;Chien blanc&quot;), a film adaptation by Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette of Gary&#x27;s 1970 book.

<text>The government of [[Poland]] takes the form of a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government.

Executive power is exercised, within the framework of a multi-party system, by the president and the Government, which consists of the Council of Ministers led by the prime minister. Its members are typically chosen from the majority party or coalition, in the lower house of parliament (the &quot;Sejm&quot;), although exceptions to this rule are not uncommon. The government is formally announced by the president, and must pass a motion of confidence in the &quot;Sejm&quot; within two weeks.

Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of parliament, &quot;Sejm&quot; and Senate. Members of Sejm are elected by proportional representation, with the proviso that non-ethnic-minority parties must gain at least 5% of the national vote to enter the lower house. Currently five parties are represented. Parliamentary elections occur at least every four years.

The president, as the head of state, is the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, has the power to veto legislation passed by parliament, which may be overridden by a majority of three fifths, and can dissolve the parliament under certain conditions. Presidential elections occur every five years. When a majority of voters support the same candidate, that candidate is declared the winner, while when there is no majority, the top two candidates participate in a runoff election.

The political system is defined in the Polish Constitution, which also guarantees a wide range of individual freedoms. The judicial branch plays a minor role in politics, apart from the Constitutional Tribunal, which can annul laws that violate the freedoms guaranteed in the constitution.

== Executive branch ==
The prime minister proposes, the president appoints, and the &quot;Sejm&quot; approves the Council of Ministers. The president is elected by popular vote for a five-year term, while the prime minister and deputy prime ministers (if any) are appointed by the president and confirmed by the &quot;Sejm&quot;. The Council of Ministers is responsible to the prime minister and the &quot;Sejm&quot;.
===Head of state===
The president is elected by terms; as head of state, supreme commander of the Armed Forces, and supreme representative of the Republic of Poland. The president has the right to veto legislation, although veto may be overridden by the assembly with a three-fifths majority vote. The president, as representative of the state in foreign affairs, shall ratify and renounce international agreements, appoint and recall the plenipotentiary representatives of the Republic of Poland and shall cooperate with the prime minister and the appropriate minister in respect of foreign policy. As Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, the president shall appoint the chief of the General Staff and commanders of branches of the Armed Forces.

The president may, regarding particular matters, convene the Cabinet Council, although it does not possess the competence of the Council of Ministers. Official acts of the president shall require, for their validity, the signature of the prime minister, nevertheless this does not apply to:

#nominating and appointing the prime minister
#shortening of the term of office of the &quot;Sejm&quot; in the instances specified in the Constitution
#introducing legislation
#requesting the &quot;Sejm&quot; to appoint the president of the National Bank of Poland
#appointing judges
#proclaiming the holding of a nationwide referendum (a consent of the Senate is required)
#signing or refusing to sign a bill
#appointing the first president of the Supreme Court, president of the Constitutional Tribunal, members of the Council for Monetary Policy, appointing and dismissing members of the National Security Council
#exercising the power of pardon
#convening the Cabinet Council

The Polish Parliament has two chambers. The lower chamber (&quot;Sejm&quot;) has 460 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies using the d&#x27;Hondt method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems, with a 5% threshold (8% for coalitions, threshold waived for national minorities). The Senate (&quot;Senat&quot;) has 100 members elected for a four-year term under the single member, one-round first-past-the-post voting method. When sitting in joint session, members of the Sejm and Senate form the National Assembly, (Polish &quot;Zgromadzenie Narodowe&quot;). 

The National Assembly is formed on three occasions: Taking the oath of office by a new president, bringing an indictment against the president of the republic to the Tribunal of State, and declaration of a President&#x27;s permanent incapacity to exercise their duties due to the state of their health. Only the first kind has occurred to date. Since 1991 elections are supervised by the National Electoral Commission (&quot;Państwowa Komisja Wyborcza&quot;), whose administrative division is called the National Electoral Office (&quot;Krajowe Biuro Wyborcze&quot;).

== Judicial branch ==
=== Justice ===

Together with the tribunals, courts form part of the judiciary in Poland. Among the bodies that administer the justice system, the following are distinguished:

* Supreme Court;
* common courts;
* administrative courts;
* military courts.

Moreover, in times of war, the Constitution allows for the establishment of extraordinary courts or the establishment of an ad hoc procedure. Court proceedings have at least two instances. The main laws regulating the operation of the judiciary are:

* The Act of 27 July 2001 - Law on the System of Common Courts;
* The Act of July 25, 2002 - Law on the System of Administrative Courts;
* The Act of August 21, 1997 - Law on the System of Military Courts;
* The Act of 23 November 2002 on the Supreme Court;
* The Act of 27 July 2001 on the National Council of the Judiciary.

=== Judges ===

Judges are appointed by the president, at the request of the National Council of the Judiciary, for an indefinite period. They cannot belong to political parties or trade unions, are independent, and are subject only to the Constitution and statutes. They are entitled to immunity and personal inviolability. Judges are also irremovable and their removal from office or suspension requires a court decision. The participation of other citizens in the administration of justice is defined by law and boils down to the application of the system of a lay judge in the first instance in common and military courts.

=== Supreme Court ===

The Supreme Court (Supreme Court) is a supervisory body over common and military courts. It is headed by the first president of the Supreme Court, appointed for a six-year term by the president of the Republic of Poland, from among candidates presented by the General Assembly of the Supreme Court of Justice. Until 2018, the court was divided into four chambers: Civil, Criminal, Military and Labour, Social Security and Public Affairs. Since 2018, there are chambers: Civil, Criminal, Labour and Social Security, Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs, and Disciplinary. Apart from the General Assembly, the second body of judicial self-government is the College of the Supreme Court.

=== Common judiciary ===

The common judiciary has three tiers. Its structure consists of district, regional and appellate courts. Common courts rule on criminal, civil, labor, economic and family law. Until 2001, there were also misdemeanor colleges, but the Constitution abolished their functioning.

=== Military judiciary ===

Military courts are criminal courts, ruling primarily on crimes committed by soldiers on active military service. The structure of the military judiciary is made up of garrison courts and military district courts. The Criminal Chamber (until 2018, including the Military Chamber) of the Supreme Court acts as the second instance or court of cassation.

=== Administrative judiciary ===

Administrative judiciary already existed in the Second Polish Republic, but it was abolished after World War II. Its gradual restoration began in 1980 with the creation of the Supreme Administrative Court (NSA). The current Constitution introduced the principle of two-instance procedures, which resulted in the establishment of voivodeship administrative courts adjudicating in the first instance. Administrative courts control the legality of administrative decisions, both against the governmental and self-governmental authorities. The president of the Supreme Administrative Court is appointed by the president for a six-year term, from among the candidates nominated by the General Assembly of Judges of the Supreme Administrative Court.

=== National Council of the Judiciary ===

The National Council of the Judiciary is a body established to protect the independence of courts and judges. He submits applications to the president to appoint judges. It has the right to apply to the Constitutional Tribunal in matters relating to the compliance of normative acts with the Constitution in the area relating to the judiciary. The National Council of the Judiciary consists of: the first president of the Supreme Court, the minister of justice, the president of the Supreme Administrative Court, a person appointed by the president, 15 judges of the Supreme Court, common, administrative and military courts, four deputies and two senators. The term of office of elected members is four years. The chairman and two of his deputies are elected from among the members of the Council.

=== Tribunals ===

==Elections==
2023 parliamentary elections

2020 presidential election
== National security ==
Poland&#x27;s top national security goal is to further integrate with NATO and other west European defense, economic, and political institutions via a modernization and reorganization of its military. Polish military doctrine reflects the same defense nature as its NATO partners.

The combined Polish army consists of ~164,000 active duty personnel and in addition 234,000 reserves.
In 2009 the Armed Forces transformed into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. Personnel levels and organization in the different branches are as follows (2004):

* Land Forces: 60,000 (4 divisions, independent units and territorial forces)
* Air Force: 26,000 (Air and Air Defense Corps)
* Navy: 14,300 (2 Fleets)
* Special Forces: 1,700 (4 Special Units – GROM, 1 PSK, &quot;Formoza&quot;, special logistics Military Unit)

The Polish military continues to restructure and to modernize its equipment. The Polish Defense Ministry General Staff and the Land Forces staff have recently reorganized the latter into a NATO-compatible J/G-1 through J/G-6 structure. Budget constraints hamper such priority defense acquisitions as a multi-role fighter, improved communications systems, and an attack helicopter.

Poland continues to be a regional leader in support and participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace Program and has actively engaged most of its neighbors and other regional actors to build stable foundations for future European security arrangements. Poland continues its long record of strong support for United Nations peacekeeping operations; it maintaining a unit in Southern Lebanon (part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, a battalion in NATO&#x27;s Kosovo Force (KFOR), and providing and actually deploying the KFOR strategic reserve to Kosovo. Poland is a strong ally of the US in Europe, and it led the Multinational Division Central-South in Iraq in the 2000s.

=== Government Protection Bureau ===
The State Protection Service (Polish: Służba Ochrony Państwa, SOP) is Poland&#x27;s equivalent of the Secret Service in the United States, providing antiterrorism and VIP security detail services for the government.

==Administrative divisions==
Poland is divided in 16 provinces or Voivodeships (&quot;województwa&quot;, singular – &quot;województwo&quot;): Lower Silesia, Kuyavia-Pomerania, Łódzkie, Lubelskie, Lubuskie, Lesser Poland, Masovian, Opolskie, Subcarpathia, Podlaskie, Pomerania, Silesia, Świętokrzyskie, Warmia-Masuria, Greater Poland and West Pomerania.

== Foreign relations ==
Poland wields considerable influence in Central and Eastern Europe and is a middle power in international affairs. The foreign policy of Poland is based on four basic commitments: to Atlantic co-operation, to European integration, to international development and to international law. Since the collapse of communism and its re-establishment as a democratic nation, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and Western affairs, supporting and establishing friendly foreign relations with both the West and with numerous European countries.

Due to its tragic historical experience with aggression of powerful neighbors (e.g., Partitions of Poland, Second World War), Polish foreign policy pursues close cooperation with a strong partner, one apt enough to give strong military support in times of critical situations. This creates the background of Poland&#x27;s tight relations with the United States.At the same time, the equally burdened attitude towards Russia results in very tense diplomatic relations, which have been constantly worsening since Vladimir Putin&#x27;s rise to power. This is an important factor for the special attention Poland pays to the political emancipation of all its Eastern neighbors: Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.

<doc id="84783" wikidata="Q212873" url="?curid=84783" title="Jane Birkin">
<text>Jane Mallory Birkin (; 14 December 1946 – 16 July 2023) was a British-French actress, singer, and designer. She had a prolific career as an actress, mostly in French cinema.

A native of London, Birkin began her career as an actress, appearing in minor roles in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966) and &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1966). In 1968 she met Serge Gainsbourg while co-starring with him in &quot;Slogan&quot;, which marked the beginning of a years-long working and personal relationship. The duo released a debut album, &quot;Jane Birkin/Serge Gainsbourg,&quot; in 1969, and Birkin appeared in the film &quot;Je t&#x27;aime moi non plus&quot; in 1976 under Gainsbourg&#x27;s direction. She mostly worked in France, where she had become a major star, and occasionally appeared in English-language films such as the Agatha Christie adaptations &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978) and &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1982), as well as James Ivory&#x27;s &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Daughter Never Cries&quot; (1998).

Birkin lived mainly in France from the late 1960s onwards and acquired French citizenship. She was the mother of photographer Kate Barry with her first husband John Barry; of actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg with Serge Gainsbourg; and of musician Lou Doillon with Jacques Doillon. She lent her name to the Hermès Birkin handbag.

After separating from Gainsbourg in 1980, Birkin continued to work both as an actress and a singer, appearing in various independent films and recording numerous solo albums. In 2016, she starred in the Academy Award-nominated short film &quot;La femme et le TGV&quot;, which she said would be her final film role.

== Early life ==
Jane Mallory Birkin was born on 14 December 1946, in Marylebone, London. Her father, Lt- Cdr David Leslie Birkin (1914–1991), grandson of Sir Thomas Birkin, 1st Baronet and a member of the wealthy Birkin family, was a Royal Navy lieutenant commander and World War II spy who had worked with the French Resistance. His first cousin was Freda Dudley Ward, a mistress of Edward VIII while he was Prince of Wales. Through her father, Birkin was a first-cousin-once-removed of film director Carol Reed, whom Birkin turned to for advice about becoming an actress when she was a teenager, and a second cousin of Reed&#x27;s nephew, actor Oliver Reed. Reed told her it all depended on if the camera loved her. Her mother, Judy Mary Campbell, was an actress best known for her work on stage, whose family was acquainted with the family of Margaret Thatcher while living in Grantham. She was Noël Coward&#x27;s muse and &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot; was written for her. Birkin&#x27;s elder brother is screenwriter and director Andrew Birkin. 

Birkin was raised in Chelsea and described herself as a &quot;shy English girl&quot;. She said that she was bullied for her looks; &quot;I suffered a lot because of my physique, especially at boarding school. The others said I was half boy, half girl. I had no breasts, not even a developing bosom. It was horrible.&quot; She said she wanted to be as pretty as Jean Shrimpton, calling herself a &quot;bad version&quot; of her. Her middle name, &quot;Mallory&quot;, was invented by her mother; it was partly inspired by the name of Arthurian author Sir Thomas Malory.

Birkin attended Miss Ironside&#x27;s School in Kensington and Upper Chine School on the Isle of Wight. In 2021, she said she had started taking sleeping pills at 16 and never stopped. At the age of 17 she met composer John Barry, whom she married in 1965 and with whom she had her first daughter, Kate, in 1967. After Barry left for the United States, the couple divorced in 1968 and Birkin returned to live with her family in London. She began auditioning for film and television roles in Britain and in Los Angeles.

== Career ==
=== Early acting credits ===
Birkin emerged in the Swinging London scene of the 1960s, appearing in an uncredited part in &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965). In 1965 she also appeared in a musical, &quot;The Passion Flower Hotel&quot;, for which John Barry wrote the music. Barry, aged 30, proposed to 17-year old Birkin but her father forbade it as she was still a minor. They married when she was 18. 

In 1965 she had her first film role in Richard Lester&#x27;s &quot;The Knack&quot;. She had a small role in Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966) with Vanessa Redgrave and Sarah Miles as a brunette model. The movie gained notoriety because of Birkin&#x27;s nude scene, which she later said she did because John Barry had told her she would not have the courage to show up naked on set. Birkin also said that on the day of her audition, she had no idea who Antonioni was. She had a more substantial role in the counterculture era film &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1966) and a starring role as a fantasy-like model in Joe Massot&#x27;s psychedelic film &quot;Wonderwall&quot; (1968).

Birkin met Serge Gainsbourg when she auditioned for the lead female role in the French film &quot;Slogan&quot; in which he was starring (1969). Although she did not speak French she won the role, co-starring alongside Gainsbourg, and she performed with him on the film&#x27;s theme song, &quot;La Chanson de Slogan&quot;, the first of many collaborations between the two. After filming &quot;Slogan&quot;, Birkin relocated to France permanently. She had a role in the French thriller &quot;La Piscine&quot; (1969) and said that the movie had enabled her to stay in France: &quot;The film saved me and enabled me to stay in France. I just finished &quot;Slogan&quot; and was due to go back to England.&quot; Though her heavy accent in French eventually did prevent her from getting some roles, it turned out to be an asset in her career, as French audiences found it charming. She later stated: &quot;Without my accent, I would have had a different career.&quot;

=== Collaborations with Serge Gainsbourg and other work===
Birkin and Barry divorced in 1969 and Birkin moved in with Gainsbourg in the Rue de Verneuil in Paris. Their relationship was volatile; on one occasion after a quarrel she threw herself into the Seine. In 1969 she appeared with Gainsbourg in two films, &quot;Les Chemins de Katmandou&quot; and &quot;Cannabis&quot;, and by herself in Jacques Deray&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;La Piscine&quot;, which starred Romy Schneider and Alain Delon. Birkin sang backing vocals on two tracks of Gainsbourg&#x27;s album &quot;l&#x27;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot; and her portait appeared on the album cover.

In 1969, Gainsbourg and Birkin released the duet &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot; (&quot;I love you ... me neither&quot;). Gainsbourg had originally written the song for Brigitte Bardot and Birkin said it was &quot;jealousy&quot; that drove her to sing it. Shortly after making the recording, Birkin and Gainsbourg went for dinner at the Hotel des Beaux Arts in Paris and without saying anything, Gainsbourg put the record on the record player. Birkin recalled that all of a sudden, all the couples around them stopped talking with their knives and forks frozen in mid-air. Gainsbourg said, &quot;I think we&#x27;ve got a hit record&quot;. The song caused a scandal for its sexual explicitness and was banned by radio stations in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In Italy, the head of their record label was jailed for offending public morality.

&quot;Je t&#x27;aime&quot; made UK chart history when on 4 October 1969 and the following week on 11 October, the song was at two different chart positions, despite being the same song, the same artists, and the same recorded version, the only difference being that they were on different record labels. It was originally released on the Fontana label, but because of the controversy, Fontana withdrew the record, which was then released on the Major Minor label. Fontana singles were still in the shops, along with the Major Minor release, and on 4 October 1969 the Major Minor release was at number three and the Fontana single at number 16. At that time it was the biggest-selling single ever for a completely foreign-language record. 

Birkin appeared on Gainsbourg&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Histoire de Melody Nelson&quot;, portraying the Lolita-like protagonist in song and on the cover. Reflecting on being a muse and collaborator of Gainsbourg&#x27;s, Birkin commented: &quot;[It is] very flattering to have the most beautiful songs, probably, in the French language written for one. [But] how much talent did I really have? Perhaps not that much.&quot; During the 1970s she released three albums, all mainly written by Gainsbourg: &quot;Di doo dah&quot; (1973), &quot;Lolita Go Home&quot; (1975) and &quot;Ex-fan des sixties&quot; (1978).

She took a break from acting in 1971–1972 after her daughter Charlotte was born, and returned in 1973 as Brigitte Bardot&#x27;s lover in Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman&quot;. She called Bardot &quot;fabulously beautiful&quot;, saying: &quot;I observed Bardot in the tiniest detail to find a flaw in her. Her mouth, her nose, her skin, her hair... She was fabulously beautiful.&quot; The same year, she had a supporting role in the horror film &quot;Dark Places&quot; with Christopher Lee and Joan Collins. She made five films in 1975, including Claude Zidi&#x27;s box-office hit &quot;La course a l&#x27;echalote&quot; and Gainsbourg&#x27;s first film as a director, &quot;Je t&#x27;aime moi non plus&quot;, which created a stir for its frank examination of sexual ambiguity, and was banned in the United Kingdom by the British Board of Film Classification. For this performance, she was nominated for a Best Actress César Award. Further albums followed, including the well-received &quot;Ex-fan des sixties&quot;, and more films, among them John Guillermin&#x27;s &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;, in which she appeared opposite Peter Ustinov, Bette Davis, Mia Farrow and Maggie Smith. In 1978, Birkin modeled in trade advertisements for Lee Cooper jeans.

By 1980 Birkin was becoming disillusioned with the &quot;hard-drinking, domineering&quot; Gainsbourg. She left him and bought a house in the 16th arrondissement Paris, where she lived for the next 15 years. They remained on good terms and shared custody of their daughter. Birkin began a relationship with film-maker Jacques Doillon after they met on the set of his film &quot;La fille prodigue&quot; and a daughter, Lou, was born in 1982. She later appeared in his film &quot;La Pirate&quot; and Jacques Rivette&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Amour par Terre&quot;.

=== Later performances and recordings ===
Birkin renewed her professional partnership with Gainsbourg, who had continued to write music for her after their breakup and recorded several albums with him, from &quot;Baby Alone in Babylone&quot; (1983), their first collaboration after their separation in 1980, to &quot;Amours des feintes&quot; (1990), the last he wrote before his death from a heart attack in March 1991. Birkin said in 2011 that Gainsbourg had been someone who &quot;drank a vast amount. It started out being funny and then it got monotonous, (but) our friendship went on until his dying day.&quot;

Of &quot;Baby Alone in Babylone&quot; Birkin has said: &quot;This was the album of the break-up when everything changed. All of a sudden, Serge got me to sing of his wounds and his feminine side. It was very unsettling to sing about the wounds that you have triggered.&quot; While recording the album, she sang as high as she could and said she had become &quot;tired of singing as the little girl who excites gentlemen in trains&quot;. She also chose &quot;Les Dessous chics&quot; as &quot;a portrait of Serge.&quot; She said: &quot;It represents the modesty of feelings, made up outrageously in blood red. Les Dessous chics means keeping one&#x27;s true feelings deep inside, as fragile as a silk stocking.&quot; &quot;Lost Song&quot; (1987) was also written by Gainsbourg.

Birkin starred in two films directed by Jacques Doillon: as Anne in &quot;La fille prodigue&quot; (The Prodigal Daughter, 1981) and as Alma in &quot;La pirate&quot; (1984, nominated for a César Award). She said &quot;The Prodigal Daughter&quot; (1981) was the first time her performance had been well received and &quot;It touched [her] deeply to be taken seriously&quot;. Before working with Doillon she did not know about his work and said: &quot;No one had ever offered me a part like that or asked me to have a nervous breakdown&quot;. She cited this film as her favorite, saying: &quot;Piccoli and I were really good. If I die, I would like the film to be shown on television, even at midnight.&quot; When it was screened at Cannes it caused a scandal, which led to an invitation for Birkin from Patrice Chéreau to star on stage in &quot;La Fausse suivante&quot; by Marivaux at Nanterre. Recalling her experience on the stage, she said: &quot;That was my first stage experience, which finally gave me the courage to sing at the Bataclan.&quot;

She worked with director Herbert Vesely on &quot;Egon Schiele Exzess und Bestrafung&quot; in 1980, appearing as the mistress of Austrian artist Egon Schiele, played by Mathieu Carrière. She appeared in the Agatha Christie films &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978) and &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; (1982). Jacques Rivette collaborated with her in &quot;Love on the Ground&quot; (1983) and &quot;La Belle Noiseuse&quot; (1991, nominated Césars best supporting actress). In 1985, she co-starred with John Gielgud in &quot;Leave All Fair&quot; (1985). She won Female Artist of the Year in the 1992 Victoires de la Musique.

In 1995 Birkin played one of the lead roles in the Euripides tragedy &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; at the National Theatre in London. She appeared in Merchant Ivory&#x27;s &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Daughter Never Cries&quot; (1998) (which also used her song &quot;Di Doo Dah&quot;) and in &quot;Merci Docteur Rey&quot; (2002). The end title song for &quot;Le Divorce&quot; (2003) featured her singing &quot;L&#x27;Anamour&quot;, composed by Gainsbourg. In 2006, she played the title role in &quot;Elektra&quot;, directed by Philippe Calvario in France.

Birkin recorded the song &quot;Beauty&quot; on French producer Hector Zazou&#x27;s album &quot;Strong Currents&quot; (2003). The album brought together a number of well-known soloists and featured her alongside Laurie Anderson, Irene Grandi and Melanie Gabriel, among others. On this album Birkin and Melanie Gabriel covered songs by Nina Hynes. Birkin undertook world tours in which she performed Gainsbourg&#x27;s songs and recorded more albums, including &quot;Lolita Go Home&quot;, &quot;Rendez-vous&quot; (2004), an album of duets with, among others, Francoise Hardy and Bryan Ferry, &quot;Fictions&quot; (2006) and &quot;Enfants d&#x27;hiver&quot; (2008). 
The cover art of &quot;Have You Fed the Fish?&quot; (2002) by singer-songwriter Badly Drawn Boy featured her image. The album included backing vocals by her daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg. In 2006 Birkin recorded and released the album &quot;Fictions&quot;, and in 2010, recorded a duet, &quot;Marie,&quot; with Brazilian singer Sérgio Dias, which appeared on &quot;We Are the Lilies&quot;, an album by Dias and French band Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family featured contributions from Iggy Pop and others.

In 2016 Birkin appeared in an advertising campaign for Yves Saint Laurent shot by Hedi Slimane which featured various female musicians, including Marianne Faithfull, Courtney Love, and Joni Mitchell. The same year, she had the lead role in &quot;La femme et le TGV&quot;, a short film directed by Swiss filmmaker Timo von Gunten. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. In a 2017 interview, Birkin stated that &quot;La femme et le TGV&quot; would be her final acting performance and that she had no plans to return to acting.

On 24 March 2017, Birkin released &quot;Birkin/Gainsbourg: Le Symphonique&quot;, a collection of songs Gainsbourg had written for her during and after their relationship, reworked with full orchestral arrangements. In September 2017, she performed live in Brussels to promote the album.

== Personal life ==
On 16 October 1965, 18-year-old Birkin married British composer and conductor John Barry, 13 years her senior, in a private ceremony at Chelsea Register Office, London. They met in 1964 when Barry cast Birkin in his musical &quot;Passion Flower Hotel&quot;. Their daughter was photographer Kate Barry (1967–2013). Barry &quot;turned out to be a cold and unfaithful husband&quot; and Birkin wrote in her diary, aged 19, &quot;The feeling of being unwanted, undesired and unloved is beginning to strangle me&quot;. Their marriage ended in 1968. She said she was insecure during the relationship and &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe that this sophisticated, talented genius chose [her] and not any of the other girls.&quot; She did not want him to see her with her &quot;tiny, piggy eyes&quot; so she would sleep with an eye pencil under her pillow and put it on if he woke up in the night. He eventually went to the United States and left Birkin with their daughter in England.

Birkin had a romantic and creative relationship with French musician Serge Gainsbourg, 18 years her senior, whom she met on the set of &quot;Slogan&quot; in 1968. They were together for 12 years but never married, despite rumours and misreporting to the contrary. She eventually became a French citizen.
In 1971, Birkin and Gainsbourg had a daughter, actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg. The couple separated in 1980, because of his alcoholism and violence. She described him as &quot;a very difficult man to live with&quot;, and said that during recording sessions he would scream at her and hit her with a ruler if she could not sing a part. She took credit for helping him to develop his style later in life, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s all about me, he listened to me a lot.&quot;

On 4 September 1982, she gave birth to her third daughter, Lou Doillon, from her relationship with director Jacques Doillon. She said: &quot;Meeting Jacques was a real turning point in my career. In my private life, after I left Serge, Jacques and I lived together for thirteen years, and had Lou.&quot; She said she was surprised and happy to find out that Doillon was not &quot;an old man&quot;. They separated in 1993. &quot;The Observer&quot; reported in 2007 that Doillon &quot;could not compete with her grief for Gainsbourg&quot; (who died in 1991), and that she had lived alone since their separation. Birkin said that Doillon lost interest in casting her in his movies, and she felt &quot;pain for Jacques going off with all these young girls making all these films all the time&quot;. Later, Birkin had a relationship with French writer Olivier Rolin.

Birkin became a political activist, and joined protest marches through the streets of Paris against racism, in defence of illegal immigrants, and in support of Palestinian rights, Amnesty International and the fight against Aids. In 2001 she received an OBE award at Buckingham Palace in London. In 2004 she was awarded France&#x27;s Ordre nationale du Merite.

In 2002, she was diagnosed with leukaemia and underwent rounds of treatment. Birkin often spent time with her six grandchildren. Her daughter, Kate Barry, died in December 2013 after falling from her fourth floor apartment in Paris. 

Birkin mainly resided in Paris from the late 1960s onwards. She was described as &quot;a fixture of the Saint-Germain-des-Prés neighbourhood on the Left Bank&quot;. In 2020, recalling 1970s Paris, she said: &quot;it was a time of great innocence, and I don&#x27;t think social problems were as they are today.&quot; On 6 September 2021, it was reported that Birkin was doing well after having a stroke.

===Death===

On 16 July 2023, Birkin was found dead at home in Paris. She was 76. No cause of death was disclosed. The premiere of the documentary &quot;Jane by Charlotte&quot;, about Birkin&#x27;s relationship with her daughter Charlotte, on 8 July 2021, was one of her last public appearances. Her funeral took place at the Church of Saint-Roch in the 1st arrondissement of Paris on the morning of 24 July. After the funeral, her remains were cremated at the crematorium of Père Lachaise Cemetery and her ashes were interred at Montparnasse Cemetery, in the grave of her daughter, Kate Barry, in the same cemetery where Gainsbourg was buried.

Many fans gathered to watch the ceremony on a large screen outside of the church. France&#x27;s First Lady Brigitte Macron and Minister of Culture Rima Abdul Malak, Catherine Deneuve and her daughter Chiara Mastroianni; Vanessa Paradis; Maïwenn; Sandrine Kiberlain; Carole Bouquet; Charlotte Rampling and Anthony Vaccarello were among those who attended.

=== Philanthropy ===
Birkin&#x27;s humanitarian interests led her to work with Amnesty International on immigrant welfare and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Countries she visited included Bosnia, Rwanda and Palestine.

=== Political views and activism ===
As a child, Birkin demonstrated in the streets of London against capital punishment. In the 1970s, she campaigned for the right to abortion and appeared at the Bobigny trial in support of four women accused of having helped the high school student Marie-Claire Chevalier to have an abortion following a rape.

Birkin campaigned against the far-right in France, participating in a protest denouncing the qualification of Jean-Marie Le Pen in the second round of the 2002 presidential election. In 2017, she performed at a free concert at the Place de la République organised in opposition to Marine Le Pen in the 2017 presidential election.

Birkin also demonstrated support for immigrants, denouncing the French government&#x27;s policy towards undocumented migrants in 2010. The same year, she protested outside the residence of the Minister of Immigration, Éric Besson. She also announced that she was sponsoring a young Congolese who had requested political asylum. In 2015, she marched in Paris in support of refugees.

In September 2018, following the resignation of French environment minister Nicolas Hulot, Birkin was one of the 200 artists and scientists who signed an open letter published on the front page of the daily &quot;Le Monde&quot; titled &quot;The Greatest Challenge in the History of Mankind&quot;, which urged politicians to act &quot;firmly and immediately&quot; in fighting climate change and the &quot;collapse of biodiversity&quot;.

In late 2022, Birkin, among other French women, cut her hair in support of Iranian women and girls who had been killed in protests at the death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest by Iranian morality police.

== Awards and honours ==
Birkin won the &quot;Best Actress&quot; award at the 1985 Orleans Film Festival for &quot;Leave All Fair&quot;. The jury of the 1985 Venice Film Festival recognised Birkin&#x27;s performance in &quot;Dust&quot; as amongst the best of the year. They decided not to award a best actress prize because all of the actresses they judged to have made the best performances were in films that won major awards. &quot;Dust&quot; won the Silver Lion prize.
In the diplomatic and overseas list of the 2001 Birthday Honours, Birkin was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire &quot;for services to acting and UK-French cultural relations&quot;. She received the Order from the Prince of Wales in April 2002.

In 2013, she and her daughter, Lou Doillon, were appointed to the &quot;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot; as &quot;Chevaliers&quot;. In 2022, she was raised to the highest rank in the order, &quot;Commandeur&quot;. She was also awarded the French &quot;Ordre National du Mérite&quot; in 2004 and 2015.

In 2018, she was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun in the Spring Conferment for her efforts in promoting cultural exchanges between Japan and France.

== In popular culture ==
=== Birkin basket ===
Birkin was described as having carried a hand-woven straw basket from Castro Marim in Algarve, Portugal, everywhere she went, from the market,&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr/53052340715&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to nightclubs,&lt;ref name=&quot;flickr/53056141460&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to formal events until her husband Jacques Doillon intentionally ran over it with his car in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;vogue/birkin-basket&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lofficielbaltic/birkin-basket&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;i-d.vice/akw8xb&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Birkin bag ===

In 1983, Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas was seated next to Birkin on a flight from Paris to London. Birkin had just placed her straw basket in the overhead compartment of her seat when the contents fell out onto the floor, leaving her scrambling to recover them. Birkin explained to Dumas that it had been difficult to find a leather weekend bag she liked. In 1984, he created a black supple leather bag for her: the Birkin bag, based on a 1982 design. She used the bag initially, but later changed her mind because she was carrying too many things in it: &quot;What&#x27;s the use of having a second one?&quot; she said laughingly. &quot;You only need one and that busts your arm; they&#x27;re bloody heavy. I&#x27;m going to have an operation for tendinitis in the shoulder.&quot; Nonetheless, Birkin did use the bag for some time. The Birkin bag has, over the years, become a status symbol, with prices ranging from US$10,000 to $500,000.

In 2015, Birkin wrote a public letter to Hermès requesting her name be removed from the bag, stating she wanted the company to &quot;debaptise the Birkin Croco until better practices in line with international norms can be put in place&quot;, referring to the cruel methods used to acquire the skins for the crocodile variant of the bags. Hermès announced soon afterwards that it had satisfied Birkin with new reassurances on this.

<text>The was an era of Japanese history that extended from October 23, 1868, to July 30, 1912. The Meiji era was the first half of the Empire of Japan, when the Japanese people moved from being an isolated feudal society at risk of colonization by Western powers to the new paradigm of a modern, industrialized nation state and emergent great power, influenced by Western scientific, technological, philosophical, political, legal, and aesthetic ideas. As a result of such wholesale adoption of radically different ideas, the changes to Japan were profound, and affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded to the reign of Emperor Meiji. It was preceded by the Keiō era and was succeeded by the Taishō era, upon the accession of Emperor Taishō.

The rapid modernization during the Meiji era was not without its opponents, as the rapid changes to society caused many disaffected traditionalists from the former samurai class to rebel against the Meiji government during the 1870s, most famously Saigō Takamori, who led the Satsuma Rebellion. However, there were also former samurai who remained loyal while serving in the Meiji government, such as Itō Hirobumi and Itagaki Taisuke.

== Meiji Restoration ==

On February 3, 1867, the 14-year-old Prince Mutsuhito succeeded his father, Emperor Kōmei, to the Chrysanthemum Throne as the 122nd emperor.

This coincided with pressure on the ruling shogunate to modernize Japan, combining modern advances with traditional values. Mutsuhito was sympathetic to these ideas, leading to a call for the restoration of the governing power to the emperor.
On November 9, 1867, then-&quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Yoshinobu tendered his resignation to the Emperor, and &quot;put his prerogatives at the Emperor’s disposal&quot;, formally stepping down ten days later. Imperial restoration occurred the next year on January 3, 1868, with the formation of the new government. The fall of Edo in the summer of 1868 marked the end of the Tokugawa shogunate, and a new era, &quot;Meiji&quot;, was proclaimed.

The first reform was the promulgation of the Five Charter Oath in 1868, a general statement of the aims of the Meiji leaders to boost morale and win financial support for the new government. Its five provisions consisted of:
# Deliberative assembly shall be widely established and all matters decided by public discussion
# All classes, high and low, shall unite in vigorously carrying out the administration of the affairs of state
# The common people, no less than the civil and military of officials, shall each be allowed to pursue his own calling so that there may be no discontent. 
# Evil customs of the past shall be broken off and everything based upon the just laws of nature.
# Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule.

Implicit in the Charter Oath was an end to exclusive political rule by the bakufu (a &quot;shōgun&quot;″s direct administration including officers), and a move toward more democratic participation in government. To implement the Charter Oath, a rather short-lived constitution with eleven articles was drawn up in June 1868. Besides providing for a new Council of State, legislative bodies, and systems of ranks for nobles and officials, it limited office tenure to four years, allowed public balloting, provided for a new taxation system, and ordered new local administrative rules.

The Meiji government assured the foreign powers that it would follow the old treaties negotiated by the bakufu and announced that it would act in accordance with international law. Mutsuhito, who was to reign until 1912, selected a new reign title—&quot;Meiji&quot;, or Enlightened Rule—to mark the beginning of a new era in Japanese history. To further dramatize the new order, the capital was relocated from Kyoto, where it had been situated since 794, to Tokyo (Eastern Capital), the new name for Edo. In a move critical for the consolidation of the new regime, most &quot;daimyōs&quot; voluntarily surrendered their land and census records to the Emperor in the abolition of the Han system, symbolizing that the land and people were under the Emperor&#x27;s jurisdiction.

Confirmed in their hereditary positions, the daimyo became governors, and the central government assumed their administrative expenses and paid samurai stipends. The han were replaced with prefectures in 1871, and authority continued to flow to the national government. Officials from the favored former han, such as Satsuma, Chōshū, Tosa, and Hizen staffed the new ministries. Formerly old court nobles, and lower-ranking samurai, replaced bakufu appointees and daimyo as a new ruling class appeared.
Inasmuch as the Meiji Restoration had sought to return the Emperor to a preeminent position, efforts were made to establish a Shinto-oriented state much like it was 1,000 years earlier. Since Shinto and Buddhism had molded into a syncretic belief in the prior thousand years and Buddhism had been closely connected with the shogunate, this involved the separation of Shinto and Buddhism (shinbutsu bunri) and the associated destruction of various Buddhist temples and related violence (haibutsu kishaku). Furthermore, a new State Shinto had to be constructed for the purpose. In 1871, the Office of Shinto Worship (:ja:神祇省) was established, ranking even above the Council of State in importance. The &quot;kokutai&quot; ideas of the Mito school were embraced, and the divine ancestry of the Imperial House was emphasized. The government supported Shinto teachers, a small but important move. Although the Office of Shinto Worship was demoted in 1872, by 1877 the Home Ministry controlled all Shinto shrines and certain Shinto sects were given state recognition. Shinto was released from Buddhist administration and its properties restored. Although Buddhism suffered from state sponsorship of Shinto, it had its own resurgence. Christianity also was legalized, and Confucianism remained an important ethical doctrine. Increasingly, however, Japanese thinkers identified with Western ideology and methods.

== Politics ==
A major proponent of representative government was Itagaki Taisuke (1837–1919), a powerful Tosa leader who had resigned from the Council of State over the Korean affair in 1873. Itagaki sought peaceful, rather than rebellious, means to gain a voice in government. He started a school and a movement aimed at establishing a constitutional monarchy and a legislative assembly. Such movements were called The Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement. Itagaki and others wrote the in 1874, criticizing the unbridled power of the oligarchy and calling for the immediate establishment of representative government.

Between 1871 and 1873, a series of land and tax laws were enacted as the basis for modern fiscal policy. Private ownership was legalized, deeds were issued, and lands were assessed at fair market value with taxes paid in cash rather than in kind as in pre-Meiji days and at slightly lower rates.

Dissatisfied with the pace of reform after having rejoined the Council of State in 1875, Itagaki organized his followers and other democratic proponents into the nationwide Aikokusha (Society of Patriots) to push for representative government in 1878. In 1881, in an action for which he is best known, Itagaki helped found the Jiyūtō (Liberal Party), which favored French political doctrines.

In 1882, Ōkuma Shigenobu established the Rikken Kaishintō (Constitutional Progressive Party), which called for a British-style constitutional democracy. In response, government bureaucrats, local government officials, and other conservatives established the Rikken Teiseitō (Imperial Rule Party), a pro-government party, in 1882. Numerous political demonstrations followed, some of them violent, resulting in further government restrictions. The restrictions hindered the political parties and led to divisions within and among them. The Jiyūtō, which had opposed the Kaishinto, was disbanded in 1884 and Ōkuma resigned as Kaishintō president.

Government leaders, long preoccupied with violent threats to stability and the serious leadership split over the Korean affair, generally agreed that constitutional government should someday be established. The Chōshū leader Kido Takayoshi had favored a constitutional form of government since before 1874, and several proposals for constitutional guarantees had been drafted. While acknowledging the realities of political pressure, however, the oligarchy was determined to keep control. Thus, modest steps were taken.

The Osaka Conference in 1875 resulted in the reorganization of government with an independent judiciary and an appointed Chamber of Elders (genrōin) tasked with reviewing proposals for a legislature. The Emperor declared that &quot;constitutional government shall be established in gradual stages&quot; as he ordered the Council of Elders to draft a constitution.

Three years later, the Conference of Prefectural Governors established elected prefectural assemblies. Although limited in their authority, these assemblies represented a move in the direction of representative government at the national level, and by 1880 assemblies also had been formed in villages and towns. In 1880 delegates from twenty-four prefectures held a national convention to establish the Kokkai Kisei Dōmei.

Although the government was not opposed to parliamentary rule, confronted with the drive for &quot;people&#x27;s rights&quot;, it continued to try to control the political situation. New laws in 1875 prohibited press criticism of the government or discussion of national laws. The Public Assembly Law (1880) severely limited public gatherings by disallowing attendance by civil servants and requiring police permission for all meetings.

Within the ruling circle, however, and despite the conservative approach of the leadership, Okuma continued as a lone advocate of British-style government, a government with political parties and a cabinet organized by the majority party, answerable to the national assembly. He called for elections to be held by 1882 and for a national assembly to be convened by 1883; in doing so, he precipitated a political crisis that ended with an 1881 imperial rescript declaring the establishment of a national assembly in 1890 and dismissing Okuma.

Rejecting the British model, Iwakura and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the Prussian constitutional system. One of the Meiji oligarchy, Itō Hirobumi (1841–1909), a Chōshū native long involved in government affairs, was charged with drafting Japan&#x27;s constitution. He led a constitutional study mission abroad in 1882, spending most of his time in Germany. He rejected the United States Constitution as &quot;too liberal&quot;, and the British system as too unwieldy, and having a parliament with too much control over the monarchy; the French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism.

Ito was put in charge of the new Bureau for Investigation of Constitutional Systems in 1884, and the Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Ito as prime minister. The positions of chancellor (or chief-minister), minister of the left, and minister of the right, which had existed since the seventh century as advisory positions to the Emperor, were all abolished. In their place, the Privy Council was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution and to advise the Emperor.

To further strengthen the authority of the State, the Supreme War Council was established under the leadership of Yamagata Aritomo (1838–1922), a Chōshū native who has been credited with the founding of the modern Japanese army and was to become the first constitutional Prime Minister. The Supreme War Council developed a German-style general staff system with a chief of staff who had direct access to the Emperor and who could operate independently of the army minister and civilian officials.
The Constitution of the Empire of Japan was enacted on November 29, 1890. It was a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy. The Emperor of Japan was legally the supreme leader, and the Cabinet were his followers. The Prime Minister would be elected by a Privy Council. In reality, the Emperor was head of state but the Prime Minister was the actual head of government.

Class distinctions were mostly eliminated during modernization to create a representative democracy. The samurai lost their status as the only class with military privileges. However, during the Meiji period, most leaders in Japanese society (politics, business and military) were ex-samurai or descendants of samurai.

The 1889 Meiji Constitution made relatively small concessions to civil rights and parliamentary mechanisms. Party participation was recognized as part of the political process. The Emperor shared his authority and gave rights and liberties to his subjects. It provided for the Imperial Diet (Teikoku Gikai), composed of a popularly elected House of Representatives with a very limited franchise of male citizens who were over twenty-five years of age and paid fifteen yen in national taxes (approximately 1% of the population). The House of Peers was composed of nobility and imperial appointees. A cabinet was responsible to the Emperor and independent of the legislature. The Diet could approve government legislation and initiate laws, make representations to the government, and submit petitions to the Emperor. The Meiji Constitution lasted as the fundamental law until 1947.

In the early years of constitutional government, the strengths and weaknesses of the Meiji Constitution were revealed. A small clique of Satsuma and Chōshū elite continued to rule Japan, becoming institutionalized as an extra-constitutional body of genrō (elder statesmen). Collectively, the genrō made decisions reserved for the Emperor, and the genrō, not the Emperor, controlled the government politically.

Throughout the period, however, political problems usually were solved through compromise, and political parties gradually increased their power over the government and held an ever-larger role in the political process as a result. Between 1891 and 1895, Ito served as Prime Minister with a cabinet composed mostly of genrō who wanted to establish a government party to control the House of Representatives. Although not fully realized, the trend toward party politics was well established.

== Society ==

On its return, one of the first acts of the government was to establish new ranks for the nobility. Five hundred people from the old court nobility, former daimyo, and samurai who had provided valuable service to the Emperor were organized into a new peerage, the Kazoku, consisting of five ranks: prince, marquis, count, viscount, and baron.

In the transition between the Edo period and the Meiji era, the Ee ja nai ka movement, a spontaneous outbreak of ecstatic behavior, took place.

In 1885, noted public intellectual Yukichi Fukuzawa wrote the influential essay &quot;Leaving Asia&quot;, arguing that Japan should orient itself at the &quot;civilized countries of the West&quot;, leaving behind the &quot;hopelessly backward&quot; Asian neighbors, namely Korea and China. This essay certainly encouraged the economic and technological rise of Japan in the Meiji era, but it also may have laid the intellectual foundations for later Japanese colonialism in the region.
The Meiji era saw a flowering of public discourse on the direction of Japan. Works like Nakae Chōmin&#x27;s &quot;A Discourse by Three Drunkards on Government&quot; debated how best to blend the new influences coming from the West with local Japanese culture. Grassroots movements like the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement called for the establishment of a formal legislature, civil rights, and greater pluralism in the Japanese political system. Journalists, politicians, and writers actively participated in the movement, which attracted an array of interest groups, including women&#x27;s rights activists.

The elite class of the Meiji era adapted many aspects of Victorian taste, as seen in the construction of Western-style pavilions and reception rooms called &quot;yōkan or yōma&quot; in their homes. These parts of Meiji homes were displayed in popular magazines of the time, such as &quot;Ladies&#x27; Graphic,&quot; which portrayed the often empty rooms of the homes of the aristocracy of all levels, including the imperial palaces. Integrating Western cultural forms with an assumed, untouched native Japanese spirit was characteristic of Meiji society, especially at the top levels, and represented Japan&#x27;s search for a place within a new world power system in which European colonial empires dominated.

=== Fashion ===

The production of kimono started to use Western technologies such as synthetic dye, and decoration was sometimes influenced by Western motifs. The textile industry modernized rapidly and silk from Tokyo&#x27;s factories became Japan&#x27;s principal export. Cheap synthetic dyes meant that bold purples and reds, previously restricted to the wealthy elite, could be owned by anyone. Faster and cheaper manufacture allowed more people to afford silk kimono, and enabled designers to create new patterns. The Emperor issued a proclamation promoting Western dress over the allegedly effeminate Japanese dress. Fukuzawa Yukichi&#x27;s descriptions of Western clothing and customs were influential. Western dress became popular in the public sphere: many men adopted Western dress in the workplace, although kimono were still the norm for men at home and for women. In the 1890s the kimono reasserted itself, with people wearing bolder and brighter styles. A new type called the bridged the gap between formal dress and everyday dress.

The technology of the time allowed for subtle color gradients rather than abrupt changes of color. Another trend was for outer and inner garments of the same design. Another trend in the Meiji era was for women&#x27;s under-kimono made by combining pieces of different fabric, sometimes of radically different colors and designs. For men, the trend was for highly decorative under-kimono that would be covered by outer kimono that were plain or very simply designed. Even the clothing of infants and young children used bold colors, intricate designs, and materials common to adult fashions. Japanese exports led to kimono becoming an object of fascination in the West.

== Economy ==
The Industrial Revolution in Japan occurred during the Meiji era. The industrial revolution began around 1870 as Meiji era leaders decided to catch up with the West. The government built railroads, improved roads, and inaugurated a land reform program to prepare the country for further development. It inaugurated a new Western-based education system for all young people, sent thousands of students to the United States and Europe, and hired more than 3,000 Westerners to teach modern science, mathematics, technology, and foreign languages in Japan (O-yatoi gaikokujin).

In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians known as the Iwakura Mission toured Europe and the US to learn western ways. The result was a deliberate state-led industrialization policy to enable Japan to quickly catch up.

Japan developed modern industry through direct state intervention. Government-owned enterprises were important to the development of key economic sectors like railways. Through government connections, major private enterprises received various forms of financial support from the state.

Modern industry first appeared in textiles, including cotton and especially silk, which was based in home workshops in rural areas. Due to the importing of new textile manufacturing technology from Europe, between 1886 and 1897, Japan&#x27;s total value of yarn output rose from 12 million to 176 million yen. In 1886, 62% of yarn in Japan was imported; by 1902, most yarn was produced locally. By 1913, Japan was producing 672 million pounds of yarn per year, becoming the world&#x27;s fourth-largest exporter of cotton yarn.

The first railway was opened between Tokyo and Yokohama in 1872. The rail system was rapidly developed throughout Japan well into the twentieth century. The introduction of railway transportation led to more efficient production due to the decrease in transport costs, allowing manufacturing firms to move into more populated interior regions of Japan in search for labor input. The railway also enabled newfound access to raw materials that had previously been too difficult or too costly to transport.
There were at least two reasons for the speed of Japan&#x27;s modernization: the employment of more than 3,000 foreign experts (called &quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot; or &#x27;hired foreigners&#x27;) in a variety of specialist fields such as teaching foreign languages, science, engineering, the army and navy, among others; and the dispatch of many Japanese students overseas to Europe and America, based on the fifth and last article of the Charter Oath of 1868: &#x27;Knowledge shall be sought throughout the world so as to strengthen the foundations of Imperial rule.&#x27; The process of modernization was closely monitored and heavily subsidized by the Meiji government, enhancing the power of the great zaibatsu firms such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi.
Hand in hand, the zaibatsu and government led Japan through the process of industrialization, borrowing technology and economic policy from the West. Japan gradually took control of much of Asia&#x27;s market for manufactured goods, beginning with textiles. The economic structure became very mercantilistic, importing raw materials and exporting finished products—a reflection of Japan&#x27;s relative poverty in raw materials.

Other economic reforms passed by the government included the creation of a unified modern currency based on the yen, banking, commercial and tax laws, stock exchanges, and a communications network. Establishment of a modern institutional framework conductive to an advanced capitalist economy took time, but was completed by the 1890s, by which time the government had largely relinquished direct control of the modernization process, primarily for budgetary reasons. The Land Tax Reform of 1873 was another significant fiscal reform by the Meiji government, establishing the right of private land ownership for the first time in Japan&#x27;s history.

Many of the former daimyo, whose pensions had been paid in a lump sum, benefited greatly through investments they made in emerging industries. Those who had been informally involved in foreign trade before the Meiji Restoration also flourished. Old bakufu-serving firms that clung to their traditional ways failed in the new business environment.

The industrial economy continued to expand rapidly, until about 1920, due to inputs of advanced Western technology and large private investments. By World War I, Japan had become a major industrial nation.

== Military ==

===Overview===
Undeterred by opposition, the Meiji leaders continued to modernize the nation through government-sponsored telegraph cable links to all major Japanese cities and the Asian mainland and construction of railroads, shipyards, munitions factories, mines, textile manufacturing facilities, factories, and experimental agriculture stations. Greatly concerned about national security, the leaders made significant efforts at military modernization, which included establishing a small standing army, a large reserve system, and compulsory militia service for all men. Foreign military systems were studied, foreign advisers, especially French ones, were brought in, and Japanese cadets sent abroad to Europe and the United States to attend military and naval schools.

===Early Meiji period (1868–77)===
In 1854, after US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry forced the signing of the Treaty of Kanagawa, Japanese elites took the position that they needed to modernize the state&#x27;s military capacities, or risk further coercion from Western powers. 

In 1868, the Japanese government established the Tokyo Arsenal. The same year, Ōmura Masujirō established Japan&#x27;s first military academy in Kyoto. Ōmura further proposed military billets be filled by all classes of people including farmers and merchants. The &quot;shōgun&quot; class, not happy with Ōmura&#x27;s views on conscription, assassinated him the following year.

In 1870, Japan expanded its military production base by opening another arsenal in Osaka. The Osaka Arsenal was responsible for the production of machine guns and ammunition. Also, four gunpowder facilities were opened at this site. Japan&#x27;s production capacity gradually expanded.

In 1872, Yamagata Aritomo and Saigō Jūdō, both new field marshals, founded the Corps of the Imperial Guards. Also, in the same year, the hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years, when in January the Conscription Law of 1873 was passed. This monumental law, signifying the beginning of the end for the samurai class, initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (blood tax) literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. Avoidance methods included maiming, self-mutilation, and local uprisings.

In conjunction with the new conscription law, the Japanese government began modeling their ground forces after the French military. Indeed, the new Japanese army used the same rank structure as the French. The enlisted corps ranks were: private, noncommissioned officers, and officers. The private classes were: jōtō-hei or upper soldier, ittō-sotsu or first-class soldier, and nitō-sotsu or second-class soldier. The noncommissioned officer class ranks were: gochō or corporal, gunsō or sergeant, sōchō or sergeant major, and tokumu-sōchō or special sergeant major.


Despite the Conscription Law of 1873, and all the reforms and progress, the new Japanese army was still untested. That all changed in 1877, when Saigō Takamori led the last rebellion of the samurai in Kyūshū. In February 1877, Saigō left Kagoshima with a small contingent of soldiers on a journey to Tokyo. Kumamoto castle was the site of the first major engagement when garrisoned forces fired on Saigō&#x27;s army as they attempted to force their way into the castle. Rather than leave an enemy behind him, Saigō laid siege to the castle. Two days later, Saigō&#x27;s rebels, while attempting to block a mountain pass, encountered advanced elements of the national army en route to reinforce Kumamoto castle. After a short battle, both sides withdrew to reconstitute their forces. A few weeks later the national army engaged Saigō&#x27;s rebels in a frontal assault at what now is called the Battle of Tabaruzuka. During this eight-day-battle, Saigō&#x27;s nearly ten thousand strong army battled hand-to-hand the equally matched national army. Both sides suffered nearly four thousand casualties during this engagement. Due to conscription, however, the Japanese army was able to reconstitute its forces, while Saigō&#x27;s was not. Later, forces loyal to the emperor broke through rebel lines and managed to end the siege on Kumamoto Castle after fifty-four days. Saigō&#x27;s troops fled north and were pursued by the national army. The national army caught up with Saigō at Mt. Enodake. Saigō&#x27;s army was outnumbered seven-to-one, prompting a mass surrender of many samurai. The remaining five hundred samurai loyal to Saigō escaped, travelling south to Kagoshima. The rebellion ended on September 24, 1877, following the final engagement with Imperial forces which resulted in the deaths of the remaining forty samurai including Saigō, who, having suffered a fatal bullet wound in the abdomen, was honorably beheaded by his retainer. The national army&#x27;s victory validated the current course of the modernization of the Japanese army as well as ended the era of the samurai.

== Foreign relations ==

When the United States Navy ended Japan&#x27;s Sakoku policy, and thus its isolation, the latter found itself defenseless against military pressures and economic exploitation by the Western powers. For Japan to emerge from the feudal period, it had to avoid the colonial fate of other Asian countries by establishing genuine national independence and equality. Following the María Luz Incident, Japan released the Chinese coolies from a western ship in 1872, after which the Qing imperial government of China gave thanks to Japan.

Following Japan&#x27;s victory over China in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), Japan broke through as an international power with a victory against Russia in Manchuria (north-eastern China) in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Allied with Britain since the Anglo-Japanese Alliance signed in London on January 30, 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I, seizing German-held territory in China and the Pacific in the process, but otherwise remained largely out of the conflict.

Following World War I, a weakened Europe left a greater share in international markets to the United States and Japan, which emerged greatly strengthened. Japanese competition made great inroads into hitherto-European-dominated markets in Asia, not only in China, but even in European colonies such as India and Indonesia, reflecting the development of the Meiji era.

The final years of the Meiji era were also marked by the annexation of Korea in 1910. Its colonial rule would persist until Japan&#x27;s defeat and surrender in World War II in 1945 during the middle of the Shōwa period and would have lasting negative repercussions on foreign relations between Japan and both North and South Korea.

== Art ==

The government took an active interest in the art export market, promoting Japanese arts at a succession of world&#x27;s fairs, beginning with the 1873 Vienna World&#x27;s Fair.
As well as heavily funding the fairs, the government took an active role organizing how Japan&#x27;s culture was presented to the world. It created a semi-public company — the (First Industrial Manufacturing Company) — to promote and commercialize exports of art and established the (Exhibition Bureau) to maintain quality standards. For the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia, the Japanese government created a Centennial Office and sent a special envoy to secure space for the 30,000 items that would be displayed. The Imperial Household also took an active interest in arts and crafts, commissioning works (&quot;presentation wares&quot;) as gifts for foreign dignitaries. In 1890, the (Artist to the Imperial Household) system was created to recognize distinguished artists; seventy were appointed from 1890 to 1944. Among these were the painter and lacquer artist Shibata Zeshin, ceramicist Makuzu Kōzan, painter Hashimoto Gahō, and cloisonné enamel artist Namikawa Yasuyuki.

As Western imports became popular, demand for Japanese art declined within Japan itself. In Europe and America, the new availability of Japanese art led to a fascination for Japanese culture; a craze known in Europe as Japonisme. Imperial patronage, government sponsorship, promotion to new audiences, and Western technology combined to foster an era of Japanese artistic innovation. In the decorative arts, Japanese artists reached new levels of technical sophistication.

Today, Masayuki Murata owns more than 10,000 Meiji art works and is one of the most enthusiastic collectors. From that time, most of the excellent works of Meiji Art were bought by foreign collectors and only a few of them remained in Japan, but because he bought back many works from foreign countries and opened the Kiyomizu Sannenzaka Museum, the study and reevaluation of Meiji Art rapidly advanced in Japan from the 21st century. Nasser Khalili is also one of the world&#x27;s most dedicated collectors of Meiji art, and his collection encompasses many categories of Meiji art. The Japanese Imperial Family also owns excellent works of Meiji Art, some of which were donated to the state and are now stored in the Museum of the Imperial Collections.

=== Enamels===

During the Meiji era, Japanese cloisonné enamel reached a technical peak, producing items more advanced than any that had existed before. The period from 1890 to 1910 was known as the &quot;Golden age&quot; of Japanese enamels. Artists experimented with pastes and with the firing process to produce ever larger blocks of enamel, with less need for &quot;cloisons&quot; (enclosing metal strips). During this period, enamels with a design unique to Japan, in which flowers, birds and insects were used as themes, became popular. Designs also increasingly used areas of blank space. The two most famous enamelers of this era were Namikawa Yasuyuki and Namikawa Sōsuke, whose family names sound the same but who were not related. Namikawa Sōsuke promoted his work as technically innovative and adopted a style resembling fine paintings. Namikawa Yasuyuki was more conservative, opting for geometrical patterns but gradually becoming more pictorial during his career. Along with the two Namikawa, the Ando Cloisonné Company has produced many high-quality cloisonné works.

=== Lacquerware ===

Gold- or silver-decorated lacquerwares had been popular in the Edo period but fell out of favor in the early nineteenth-century due to economic hardship. The Meiji era saw a renewed interest in lacquer as artists developed new designs and experimented with new textures and finishes. Foremost among these was Shibata Zeshin, who has been called &quot;Japan&#x27;s greatest lacquerer&quot;. The appeal of his highly original style was in the choice of motifs and subject matter rather than embedded gold and silver. He placed lacquer panels in frames, imitating Western oil paintings. Other notable lacquer artists of the 19th century include Nakayama Komin and Shirayama Shosai, both of whom, in contrast with Zeshin, maintained a classical style that owed a lot to Japanese and Chinese landscape art. &quot;Maki-e&quot;, decorating the lacquer in gold or silver dust, was the most common technique for quality lacquerware in this period. Lacquer from Japanese workshops was recognized as technically superior to what could be produced anywhere else in the world.

=== Metalwork ===

At the start of the Meiji era, Japanese metalwork was almost totally unknown outside the country, unlike lacquer and porcelain which had previously been exported. Metalwork was connected to Buddhist practice, for example in the use of bronze for temple bells and incense cauldrons, so there were fewer opportunities for metalworkers once Buddhism was displaced as the state religion. International exhibitions brought Japanese cast bronze to a new foreign audience, attracting strong praise. Suzuki Chokichi, a leading producer of cast bronze for international exhibition, became director of the Kiritsu Kosho Kaisha from 1874 to the company&#x27;s dissolution in 1891. In 1896 he was appointed Artist to the Imperial Household. The works of Chokichi and his contemporaries took inspiration from late Edo period carvings and prints, combining and sometimes exaggerating traditional design elements in new ways to appeal to the export market. The past history of samurai weaponry equipped Japanese metalworkers to create metallic finishes in a wide range of colors. By combining and finishing copper, silver and gold in different proportions, they created specialized alloys including shakudō and shibuichi. With this variety of alloys and finishes, an artist could give the impression of full-color decoration. Some of these metalworkers were appointed Artists to the Imperial Household, including Kano Natsuo, Unno Shomin, Namekawa Sadakatsu, and Jomi Eisuke II.

=== Porcelain ===

Japan&#x27;s porcelain industry was well-established at the start of the Meiji era, but the mass-produced wares were not known for their elegance. During this era, technical and artistic innovations turned porcelain into one of the most internationally successful Japanese decorative art forms. The career of porcelain artist Makuzu Kōzan is an archetype for the trajectory of Meiji art. He was passionate about preserving traditional influences but adopted new technologies from the West. He was an entrepreneur as well as an artist, organizing a workshop with many artisans and actively promoting his work at international exhibitions, travelling extensively in Europe. As his career went on, he adopted more Western influences on his decoration, while his works shaped Western perceptions of Japanese design. Underglaze blue painting on porcelain was well-established in Japan, and the Kozan workshop transformed this practice, combining multiple underglaze colors on a single item and introducing more subtle graduations of color.

Satsuma ware was a name originally given to pottery from Satsuma province, elaborately decorated with gilt and enamel. These wares were highly praised in the West. Seen in the West as distinctively Japanese, this style actually owed a lot to imported pigments and Western influences and had been created with export in mind. Workshops in many cities raced to produce this style to satisfy demand from Europe and America, often producing quickly and cheaply. So, the term &quot;Satsuma ware&quot; came to be associated not with a place of origin but with lower-quality ware created purely for export. Despite this, artists such as Yabu Meizan and Makuzu Kōzan maintained the highest artistic standards while also successfully exporting. From 1876 to 1913, Kōzan won prizes at 51 exhibitions, including the World&#x27;s fair and the National Industrial Exhibition.

=== Ivory carving ===

In the Meiji period, Japanese clothes began to be westernized and the number of people who wore kimono decreased, so the craftsmen who made &quot;netsuke&quot; and &quot;kiseru&quot; with ivory and wood lost their demand. Therefore, they tried to create a new field, ivory sculptures for interior decoration, and many elaborate works were exported to foreign countries or purchased by the Imperial Family. In particular, the works of Ishikawa Komei and Asahi Gyokuzan won praise in Japan.

=== Textiles ===
The 1902 edition of &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; wrote, &quot;In no branch of applied art does the decorative genius of Japan show more attractive results than that of textile fabrics, and in none has there been more conspicuous progress during recent years. [...] Kawashima of Kyoto [...] inaugurated the departure a few years ago by copying a Gobelin, but it may safely be asserted that no Gobelin will bear comparison with the pieces now produced in Japan&quot;. Very large, colorful pictorial works were being produced in Kyoto. Embroidery had become an art form in its own right, adopting a range of pictorial techniques such as chiaroscuro and aerial perspective.
=== Music ===

The interaction of Western and Japanese music in Meiji era is foremost linked to the military, religious and educational fields. The Japanese assimilated Western culture and its music with the same surprising speed. Music panorama in Japan gradually became lively and prolific where the Western-inspired style music was flourishing.

====Military music====
The very first stage of Western adaptation in the Meiji period is associated with the military field. A little before the reopening of Japan the first military academy based on Dutch model was founded in Nagasaki where, alongside the military training, military music was taught, since it was acknowledged to be an important component of the martial arts. The first military band, called kotekitai, consisted of woodwind instruments and drums, was organized there.

Gradually, Western music became an integral part of the Japanese culture where the importance of Western music was undertaken as a part of a social project. The military bands played prominent role in the society. That included public concerts of Western music, which were held in a famous Rokumeikan Hall and Hibiya Open-Air stage in Tokyo, performing marches, patriotic music and European composers’ works (Richard Wagner, Charles Gounod, Peter Tchaikovsky).

With the contribution of foreign and Japanese authors, the first military music score collections were completed and published. In the military field, the Japanese conducting school was formed, the founders of which were English, French and German cultural figures such as John William Fenton, Charles Leroux, and Franz Eckert. Under their leadership, the first Japanese military conductors were raised: Suketsune Nakamura and Yoshitoyo Yotsumoto.

====Christian music====
Christian missions also became an important way for spreading Western-style music in Meiji era.

In the sixteenth century Portuguese missionaries introduced the first Western-style music to Japan: sacred choral music, music for organ, flute, harp, trumpet, violin, alto, double bass. However, soon Christianity, along with its institutions, was banned. In the Meiji era, the ban of Christianity was lifted. Thus, Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant missionaries started actively preaching, and the introduction of sacred music became an integral part of their activities.

The Orthodox mission introduced traditional choral music in Japan. The great impact in the choral music development was made by Ukrainian musicians: conductors Yakov Tikhai (served in the Orthodox mission from 1874 to 1886) and Dmytro Livovsky (served in the Orthodox mission from 1880 to 1921). They organized the first traditional choirs in Holy Resurrection Cathedral in Tokyo (known as Nikolai-do), taught music in Tokyo Theological Seminary, completed and published the first musical score collections, and educated the first Japanese choir conductors and music teachers. Among them are Roman Chiba, Alexey Obara, Innokentiy Kisu, Yakov Maedako, Petr Tokairin, Ioan Nakashima, Moisei Kawamura, Ioan Owata, Pavel Isiya, Vasiliy Takeda, Andrey Abe, Alexandr Komagai, Fedor Minato, Alexey Sawabe, Luka Orit.

All of them became Orthodox Christians and adopted Christian names.

====Education====
The educational field also was a major way for adopting Western-style music. The educational reforms were led by Isawa Shūji (1851–1917) and Luther Whiting Mason (1828–1896). In 1880, the Music Research Institute in Tokyo (Ongaku Torishirabe Gakari), headed by Izawa Shuji, was founded. The Institute had three main tasks: 1) to introduce compulsory music teaching in schools, to introduce Western-style songs; 2) to train music teachers for the further development of professional musical activities; 3) to create music score collections for children, in which Japanese and Western style music elements could be combined. Thus, the first music scores “The First Collection for Primary School” was published in 1881. The newly educated music teachers organized lessons in singing, music theory, playing musical instruments (koto, kokyū, piano, organ and violin).

In 1887, the Music Research Institute was reformed into Tokyo Academy of Music, which gave the Institution a new status and contributed to its further development. Western music was regarded as an essential contributory factor for modernization. The new curriculum was improved, and the number and quality of the musical events increased.

Tokyo Academy of Music became the first Western-style music educational establishment in Japan. This was the nascence of schools teaching composition in the Western style in Japan, the genesis of an opera tradition in Japan, and laid the foundations for the Japanese formal tradition of familiarization with Western music.
==Conversion tables==

===Before 1873===
Prior to Japan adopting the Gregorian calendar, it used the lunisolar Japanese calendar. The first five years of the era correspond to the following date ranges in the Gregorian calendar:
Conversely, the conversion table of Gregorian calendar years 1868 to 1872 to the traditional Japanese lunisolar calendar is shown below:
===Since 1873===
On January 1, 1873, Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar. To convert any Gregorian calendar year between 1873 and 1912 to Japanese calendar year in Meiji era, 1867 needs to be subtracted from the year in question.

<text>Willem Frederik &quot;Wim&quot; Duisenberg (; 9 July 1935 – 31 July 2005) was a Dutch politician and economist who served as President of the European Central Bank from 1 June 1998 until 31 October 2003. He was a member of the Labour Party (PvdA).
Duisenberg worked as a financial analyst for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from January 1966 until March 1969 and as an economist for the Dutch central bank (DNB) from March 1969 until February 1970. Duisenberg worked as a professor of Macroeconomics at the University of Amsterdam from February 1970 until May 1973. After the election of 1972 Duisenberg was appointed as Minister of Finance in the Cabinet Den Uyl taking office on 11 May 1973. The Cabinet Den Uyl fell just before the end of its term. After the election of 1977 Duisenberg was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives serving from 8 June 1977 until 8 September 1977 and again from 16 January 1978 and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances. In June 1978 Duisenberg unexpectedly announced his retirement and resigned from the House of Representatives on 28 June 1978. Duisenberg semi-retired from active politics at just 42 and became active in the private sector as a corporate director, and worked as a banker for the Rabobank. In November 1981 Duisenberg was nominated as the next President of the Central Bank taking office on 1 January 1982. In June 1997 Duisenberg was nominated as the next President of the European Monetary Institute (EMI), taking office on 1 July 1997. In May 1998 the EMI was reformed to the European Central Bank (ECB) with Duisenberg appointed as the first President of the European Central Bank serving from 1 June 1998 until 31 October 2003.

Duisenberg retired from active politics a second time at 68 and became active again in the private and public sectors as a corporate and non-profit director and served on several state commissions and councils on behalf of the government. Following his retirement Duisenberg continued to be active as an advocate and lobbyist for balanced governmental budgets, financial regulation and more European integration. Duisenberg was known for his abilities as a skillful manager and effective negotiator and continued to comment on political affairs until his death after suffering a heart attack and drowning in a swimming pool in July 2005 at the age of 70. He holds the distinction as the youngest-serving Dutch Minister of Finance at the age of .

==Early life and education==
Willem Frederik Duisenberg was born on 9 July 1935 in the Frisian city of Heerenveen in the Netherlands. He was the son of Lammert Duisenberg, who was a waterworks supervisor, and Antje Ykema. He went to a public primary school in his hometown. He went to secondary school, first one year of Hogere Burgerschool and then gymnasium with natural sciences, also in Heerenveen. In 1954, Duisenberg moved to Haren. He studied at the University of Groningen in Groningen from 1954 to 1961, where he received his &quot;doctorandus&quot; degree (equivalent of Master of Science) &quot;cum laude&quot; in economics, majoring in international relations. He was a member of Groninger Studentencorps Vindicat atque Polit. In 1959, he became a member of the Labour Party. In 1960, he married Tine Stelling. In 1965, he obtained his &quot;doctor&quot; degree (equivalent of Doctor of Philosophy) with his thesis &quot;De economische gevolgen van de ontwapening&quot; (The economic consequences of the disarmament) under the supervision of professor F. J. de Jong.

==Politics==

Duisenberg subsequently worked for the International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C., for years followed by a year as an advisor to the director of the Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank in Amsterdam. He was then appointed a professor at the University of Amsterdam where he taught macroeconomics. From 1973 to 1977, Duisenberg was Minister of Finance under Prime Minister Joop den Uyl. Shortly afterwards, he gave up his seat in Parliament to become vice president of Rabobank, a Dutch bank. Two years later, he was appointed director of the Nederlandsche Bank, serving as its president from 1982 to 1997. His tenure at the Dutch central bank was marked by caution and reserve. Under his direction, the Dutch guilder was linked to the German Deutsche Mark; this benefited the Dutch economy, owing to the strength of the German currency. He also followed German central bank&#x27;s interest rate policies closely, which earned him the nickname &quot;Mr. Fifteen Minutes&quot; because he quickly followed any interest rate changes made by the Deutsche Bundesbank.

==First president of the European Central Bank==

Owing to the success of his monetary policy, he became well known in other European countries, and this led to his appointment in 1998 as the first president of the new European Central Bank in Frankfurt, much to the chagrin of France, who wanted a French candidate. A compromise was agreed upon (although publicly denied by all parties) whereby Duisenberg would serve for at least four years, upon which the Frenchman Jean-Claude Trichet, director of the Banque de France, would take over. In 1999, Duisenberg received the Vision for Europe Award in recognition of his efforts toward the unification of Europe.

During his tenure at the bank, Duisenberg was known for his cautious monetary policy and for defending the euro through its early years. He sometimes frustrated investors and politicians by sticking to the bank&#x27;s inflation-fighting stance, keeping rates higher than some would have liked. &quot;I hear, but I don&#x27;t listen&quot; to such pleas, was one of his typically blunt responses. Duisenberg repeatedly said it was up to European governments to pursue structural changes such as loosening rigid rules on hiring and firing personnel if they wanted more growth. Duisenberg announced he would retire on 9 July 2003 (his 69th birthday), but he remained in office until Trichet was cleared of charges of fraud in connection with the collapse of the French bank Crédit Lyonnais. Trichet took over presidency of the ECB on 1 November 2003.

==Death==
Duisenberg died in 2005 at the age of 70 while on vacation at his villa in Faucon near Orange, France. He drowned in his swimming pool after suffering a heart attack. A commemoration service was held on 6 August 2005 in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. Duisenberg was buried later that day in the Zorgvlied cemetery in Amsterdam.

** Commander 
* Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau (Netherlands)
* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic

<text>&quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; is an 1820 short story by American author Washington Irving contained in his collection of 34 essays and short stories titled &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; Irving wrote the story while living in Birmingham, England.

Along with Irving&#x27;s companion piece &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; is among the earliest examples of American fiction with enduring popularity, especially during Halloween because of a character known as the Headless Horseman believed to be a Hessian soldier who was decapitated by a cannonball in battle.

It has been adapted for the screen several times, including a 1922 silent film and in 1949, a Walt Disney animation as one of two segments in the package film &quot;The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad&quot;.

==Plot==
The story is set in 1790 in the countryside near the former Dutch settlement of Tarry Town, in a secluded glen known as Sleepy Hollow. It relates the tale of Ichabod Crane, a lean, lanky, superstitious schoolmaster from Connecticut. Ichabod intends to woo Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter of a wealthy farmer, in order to procure her family&#x27;s riches for himself. He competes for her affection with Abraham &quot;Brom Bones&quot; Van Brunt, the town rowdy. Unable to goad Ichabod into fighting for Katrina&#x27;s hand, Brom instead wages a campaign of harassment against the schoolmaster, plaguing him with a series of pranks and practical jokes.

One autumn night, Ichabod is invited to attend a harvest party at the Van Tassel homestead. At the party, Brom tells the story of the Headless Horseman, the notorious ghost of a Hessian trooper decapitated by a cannonball during the Revolutionary War. The Horseman is supposedly buried in a churchyard in Sleepy Hollow and rises from his grave every night to search for his missing head but is supernaturally barred from crossing a wooden bridge that spans a nearby stream.

Katrina rejects Ichabod before he leaves. He leaves the party crestfallen and rides home on a borrowed plow horse named Gunpowder. He encounters a cloaked rider and believes it to be the Headless Horseman. Ichabod rides for his life with the apparition close behind. At the bridge, the Horseman rears his horse and hurls his severed head directly at Crane, knocking him off his horse.

The next morning, Gunpowder is found eating the grass at his master&#x27;s gate, but Ichabod has disappeared from the area, leaving Katrina to marry Brom Bones. Although the true nature of both the Headless Horseman and Ichabod&#x27;s disappearance is left open to interpretation, it is implied that the Horseman was actually Brom. A shattered pumpkin is found near Ichabod&#x27;s hat where he fell, suggesting that the severed head thrown at him was merely a jack-o&#x27;-lantern and that Crane survived the fall from Gunpowder and fled Sleepy Hollow in horror.

In a postscript, a Mr. Knickerbocker recounts hearing the tale at a Corporation meeting in Manhattan, narrated by a humorous, shabby gentleman. The story ends with mixed reactions from the audience, including laughter and skepticism. A serious old gentleman questions the moral of the story, to which the storyteller humorously responds that the tale proves life&#x27;s situations have their advantages if one can find humor in them. The old gentleman remains puzzled, and the storyteller admits he doesn&#x27;t believe half of the story himself.

==Background==
The story was the longest one published as part of &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;The Sketch Book&quot;), which Irving issued serially throughout 1819 and 1820, using the pseudonym &quot;Geoffrey Crayon&quot;. Irving wrote &quot;The Sketch Book&quot; during a tour of Europe, and parts of the tale may also be traced to European origins. Headless horsemen were staples of northern Europe storytelling, featured in German, Irish (e.g., Dullahan), Scandinavian (e.g., the Wild Hunt), and British legends, and included in Robert Burns&#x27;s Scots poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot; (1790) and Gottfried August Bürger&#x27;s &quot;Der Wilde Jäger&quot; (1778), translated as &quot;The Wild Huntsman&quot; (1796). Usually viewed as omens of ill fortune for those who chose to disregard their apparitions, these specters found their victims in proud, scheming persons and characters with hubris and arrogance. One particularly influential rendition of this folktale is the last of the &quot;&quot; () from Johann Karl August Musäus&#x27;s literary retellings of German folktales, (1783).

After the Battle of White Plains in October 1776, the country south of the Bronx River was abandoned by the Continental Army and occupied by the British. The Americans were fortified north of Peekskill, leaving Westchester County a 30-mile stretch of scorched and desolated no-man&#x27;s-land, vulnerable to outlaws, raiders, and vigilantes. Besides droves of Loyalist rangers and British light infantry, Hessian Jägers—renowned sharpshooters and horsemen—were among the raiders who often skirmished with Patriot militias. The Headless Horseman may have indeed been based loosely on the discovery of such a corpse found in Sleepy Hollow after a violent skirmish and later buried by the Van Tassel family in an unmarked grave in the Old Dutch Burying Ground.

According to another hypothesis, Irving could have drawn the figure of the &quot;headless rider&quot; from German Silesian literature, precisely from the Chronicle of Sprottau (since 1945 Polish Szprotawa) by J.G. Kreis, written in the first half of the 19th century. In the 19th century, the police counselor Kreis noted that, in the previous century, the inhabitants of this city were afraid to move after dusk on &quot;Hospitalstrasse&quot; (now Sądowa Street) due to the headless rider apparition seen there.
In support of the hypothesis, according to information in &quot;Polish Reception of Washington Irving&#x27;s Work: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism&quot; by Zofia Sinko, Walter Scott encouraged Irving to learn German to be able to read stories, ballads, and legends in their native language.

Irving, while he was an &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins, met an army captain named Ichabod Crane in Sackets Harbor, New York, during an inspection tour of fortifications in 1814. Irving may have patterned the character after Jesse Merwin, who taught at the local schoolhouse in Kinderhook, further north along the Hudson River, where Irving spent several months in 1809. Alternatively, it is claimed by many in Tarrytown that Samuel Youngs is the individual from whom Irving drew his character. Author Gary Denniss asserts that while Crane is loosely based on Merwin, it may include elements from Youngs&#x27;s life.
With &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; is one of Irving&#x27;s most anthologized, studied, and adapted sketches. Both stories are often paired together in books and other representations, and both are included in surveys of early American literature and Romanticism. Irving&#x27;s depictions of regional culture and themes of progress versus tradition, supernatural intervention in the commonplace, and the plight of the individual outsider in a homogeneous community permeate both stories and helped develop a unique sense of American cultural and existential selfhood during the early 19th century.

<text>The history of Ukraine spans thousands of years, rooted in the Pontic steppe, a region central to the spread of the Chalcolithic and Bronze Ages, Indo-European migrations, and domestication of the horse. In antiquity, the area was part of Scythia and later inhabited by Goths, Huns, and Slavic tribes. Southern Ukraine was colonized by the Greeks and Romans, leaving a significant cultural heritage.

Ukraine enters into written history with the establishment of the medieval state of Kievan Rus&#x27;. In Dnieper Ukraine, the tribe of Polans served as the organizers of Kievan Rus&#x27; state, beginning to name themself and their land &quot;Rus&#x27;&quot; in 9th century, a word that probably derived from the Varangians, who laid the foundation of the state itself. It emerged as one of the most powerful and advanced nations of Europe at that time, with Kyiv meeting its golden age and Christianization under Volodymyr the Great and Yaroslav the Wise. Kievan Rus&#x27; started to disintegrate in High Middle Ages, with Kyivan monarchs competing and fighting over the throne in the core Rus&#x27; land, while experiencing Turkic raids from Southern Ukraine. In 13th century, Kievan Rus&#x27; was destroyed by the Mongol invasion, leaving its core in Dnieper Ukraine absolutely devastated, but the Kingdom of Ruthenia (Galicia-Volhynia) succeeded Kievan Rus&#x27; under King Daniel.

In 14th and 15th centuries, the majority of Ukrainian territories became part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia, while Galicia and Transcarpathia came under Polish and Hungarian rule. Lithuania kept the local Ruthenian traditions, and was gradually influenced by Ruthenian language, law and culture, until Lithuania itself came under Polish influence, following the Union of Krewo and Union of Lublin, resulting in two countries merging into Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, leaving Ukrainian lands under the dominance of Polish crown. Meanwhile Southern Ukraine was dominated by Golden Horde and then Crimean Khanate, which came under protection of the Ottoman Empire, major regional power in and around Black Sea, which also had some of its own directly-administrated areas as well.

In the 17th century, the Cossack rebellion led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky marked a turning point in the Ukraine&#x27; history. The uprising, which began in 1648, was fueled by grievances against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s nobility, religious tensions, and social inequalities. This rebellion led to the creation of the Cossack Hetmanate, a semi-autonomous polity in central and eastern Ukraine. In 1654, the Cossack Hetmanate allied with the Tsardom of Moscow through the Pereyaslav Agreement. The nature of this alliance has been widely debated by historians. Some argue that it established a protectorate relationship, with Russia offering military support in exchange for loyalty, while others believe it symbolized the subordination of the Hetmanate to the Tsar. The ambiguity of the treaty&#x27;s terms and differing interpretations contributed to tensions over the following decades. Over time, the relationship between the Cossack Hetmanate and Russia evolved, with Russia increasingly asserting dominance. This process intensified in the late 17th and 18th centuries, especially after the Truce of Andrusovo, which divided Ukraine between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia.

The Cossack Hetmanate&#x27;s autonomy was progressively eroded, culminating in its abolition by Catherine the Great in the late 18th century. Simultaneously, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s internal decline and external pressures from neighboring powers facilitated the partitions of Poland. These partitions allowed the Russian Empire to incorporate vast Ukrainian territories, including those previously under Polish control. Western Ukraine, however, came under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy. This division set the stage for the different historical trajectories of Ukrainian lands under Russian and Austrian influence.

The 20th century began with a renewed struggle for Ukrainian statehood. Following the collapse of empires during World War I, the Ukrainian People’s Republic (UPR) was proclaimed in 1917 with Kyiv as its capital. Meanwhile, in the western territories, the West Ukrainian People’s Republic (WUPR) was established in 1918, centered in Lviv. Both republics sought to unite, forming the Unification Act (Act Zluky) on 22 January 1919. However, their independence was short-lived. The UPR faced constant military conflict with Bolshevik forces, Poland, and White Army factions. By 1921, following the Soviet-Ukrainian War, Ukrainian lands were divided: the eastern territories became the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (part of the USSR), while western Ukraine was absorbed by Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia.

Under Soviet rule, initial policies of Ukrainianization gave way to oppressive Russification. The Holodomor famine of 1932–1933, a man-made disaster, caused the deaths of 4-5 millions Ukrainians. During World War II, Ukraine endured brutal occupations by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) fought for independence, though parts of Ukrainian society also collaborated with occupying forces. Post-war, Soviet control was reestablished, and Crimea was transferred to Ukraine in 1954.

Ukraine became independent when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. This started a period of transition to a market economy, in which Ukraine suffered an eight-year recession. Subsequently however, the economy experienced a high increase in GDP growth until it plunged during the Great Recession. This period was marked by economic challenges, the rise of nationalism, and growing tensions with Russian Federation. In 2013, the Euromaidan protests began in response to President Viktor Yanukovych’s rejection of an EU association agreement. The Revolution of Dignity followed, leading to Yanukovych’s ousting. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and supported separatist movements in Donbas, initiating the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. This escalated on 24 February 2022, with Russia’s full-scale invasion, marking a critical phase in Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

== Prehistory ==
=== Paleolithic and Mesolithic Age ===

The discovery of 1.4-million-year-old stone tools in Korolevo, located in western Ukraine, marks one of the earliest securely dated presences of hominins in Europe. These tools offer crucial insights into the behaviors and adaptive strategies of early members of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, likely &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, as they expanded into the continent during the Lower Paleolithic period. The Neanderthal presence in Ukraine is well-documented through archaeological findings, particularly at the Molodova sites, which are located in the modern-day Chernivtsi region in southwestern Ukraine. These sites, dating to the Middle Paleolithic period (), provide significant evidence of Neanderthal activity. Molodova is known for its rich cultural layers attributed to the Mousterian tradition, showcasing the use of fire, mammoth bone processing, and possible construction of primitive shelters. These sites, located along the Dniester River, are particularly notable for their evidence of advanced behavior. One remarkable feature is the discovery of a dwelling constructed from mammoth bones, a testament to Neanderthal ingenuity and adaptation to harsh Ice Age environments. These structures highlight their ability to organize resources and create durable shelters.

The Crimean Mountains hold significant evidence of early modern humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) during the Upper Paleolithic period. The Buran-Kaya cave sites have yielded artifacts, such as tools and ornaments, along with skeletal remains, dating to approximately 32,000 BC. These Gravettian settlements reflect a sophisticated hunter-gatherer culture, known for their blade-based lithic technologies and artistic expression. The region likely served as a vital hub for human activity, offering both shelter and access to diverse ecological resources. The archaeological record in Ukraine highlights the area&#x27;s importance as a crossroads for early human populations migrating through Europe. From the earliest stone tools to evidence of complex social structures and artistic traditions, Ukraine offers a valuable lens into the evolution and adaptation of early humans over hundreds of thousands of years.

=== Neolithic and Bronze Age ===

The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture (), centered in modern-day Romania, Moldova, and Ukraine, represents one of the most advanced Neolithic civilizations in Europe. These people were known for their impressive settlements, some of which were among the largest in the world at the time, with populations reaching up to 10,000 inhabitants. They built concentric layouts of houses, often using clay and wood, demonstrating advanced planning. They are renowned for their intricate painted ceramics, featuring geometric and symbolic designs in red, black, and white. Their economy was primarily agrarian, complemented by animal husbandry and small-scale trade. Archaeological findings suggest a focus on fertility cults, as evidenced by numerous figurines and symbolic artifacts. The Cucuteni–Trypillia culture began to decline around 3000 BC, possibly due to environmental changes, resource depletion, or pressures from neighboring steppe cultures.

The Sredny Stog culture () emerged to the east of the Cucuteni–Trypillian zone, on the Pontic–Caspian steppe. It marked a transitional phase between the Neolithic and the emergence of the early Bronze Age steppe cultures. This culture is among the earliest to show evidence of horse domestication, which became a defining feature of steppe societies. Early indications of mound burial (kurgans) began to appear, reflecting evolving social hierarchies and ritual practices. The Sredny Stog culture played a significant role in the genesis of the later Yamna culture.
The Yamna culture (), also known as the Pit Grave culture, was a dominant force in the early Bronze Age across the Pontic–Caspian steppe. This culture is often linked with the spread of Indo-European languages and reflects a shift toward a more mobile, pastoralist lifestyle. The Yamna culture is characterized by its kurgans, often accompanied by grave goods such as weapons, ornaments, and animal sacrifices. The economy relied heavily on livestock, including sheep, cattle, and horses, which supported a semi-nomadic lifestyle. They utilized copper and bronze tools and weapons, demonstrating early metallurgical skills. Many scholars associate the Yamna culture with Proto-Indo-European speakers, as their migrations and cultural diffusion likely influenced vast areas of Europe and Asia.

Following the Yamna culture, the Catacomb culture () emerged, encompassing much of the same geographic area. It is distinguished by its unique burial practices, where bodies were interred in specially carved niches within grave pits. They further advanced bronze metallurgy, producing a variety of tools, weapons, and ornaments. The Catacomb culture maintained many traditions of the Yamna culture while also interacting with neighboring groups to the west and south.

== Antiquity ==
=== Scythian settlement, Greek colonization, and Roman domination ===

During the Iron Age, the region witnessed the rise and interaction of diverse peoples and cultures. Following earlier Bronze Age societies, the Dacians, alongside nomadic groups such as the Cimmerians (associated with the Novocherkassk archaeological culture), Scythians, and Sarmatians, dominated the landscape. Among these, the Scythians established a powerful kingdom that flourished between 750 and 250 BC, characterized by their mastery of mounted warfare and trade networks spanning vast territories.

One of the notable events in Scythian history was the campaign of Darius the Great in 513 BC. The Achaemenid Persian king led an expedition aimed at subjugating the Scythians. While the Scythians employed their signature scorched-earth and guerrilla tactics to evade outright defeat, the campaign resulted in the Persian domination of several Thracian peoples and regions along the Black Sea’s northern coast. These territories, encompassing parts of modern-day Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and southern Russia, were incorporated into the vast Achaemenid sphere of influence, though direct control remained tenuous.
Meanwhile, Greek colonization left a lasting imprint on the region. Beginning in the 7th or 6th century BC during the Archaic period, Greek settlers established colonies along the northern Black Sea coast, including Crimea and parts of modern Ukraine. These colonies, such as Chersonesus and Olbia, served as hubs of trade, cultural exchange, and Hellenic influence. The Bosporan Kingdom, a Greco-Scythian polity formed in this context, became a regional power, blending Greek traditions with local elements. It thrived until the 4th century AD, when invasions by the Goths and later the Huns disrupted its stability.

The Roman Empire, expanding its reach into the region, briefly annexed the Bosporan Kingdom from 62 to 68 AD under Emperor Nero. During this period, the reigning Bosporan king, Tiberius Julius Cotys I, was deposed, and the kingdom was directly administered by Rome. Following Nero’s rule, the Bosporan Kingdom was restored as a Roman client state, retaining local governance but under Roman military oversight. This arrangement ensured the region remained within Rome’s economic and strategic sphere during the middle of the 1st century AD.

=== Arrival of the Goths and Huns ===

In the 3rd century AD, the Goths, a Germanic people originally from Scandinavia, began migrating toward Eastern Europe. By approximately 250 to 375 AD, they had settled in the area of modern Ukraine, which they referred to as Oium. This region is linked to the archaeological Chernyakhov culture, known for its unique mix of local and Gothic influences.

The Goths in this region soon divided into two main groups: the Visigoths (Western Goths) and the Ostrogoths (Eastern Goths). The Ostrogoths established a stronghold in Ukraine but faced significant changes in the 370s with the arrival of the Huns, a nomadic group from Central Asia. The Huns were powerful warriors and ultimately brought the Ostrogoths under their control, leading to major shifts in Gothic society and governance.
To the north of the Ostrogothic territory was the Kyiv culture, a Slavic archaeological culture that thrived from the 2nd to the 5th centuries AD. As the Huns expanded their influence across Eastern Europe, this culture also came under threat. Many Slavic and other local groups were affected by the Hunnic invasions, resulting in changes in settlement patterns and local governance.

In 454 AD, a decisive battle known as the Battle of Nedao marked a turning point. The Ostrogoths, along with other Germanic tribes, rebelled against the Huns and contributed to their defeat. Following this victory, the Ostrogoths were permitted by the Romans to settle in Pannonia (modern-day Hungary), marking their departure from the Ukrainian lands.

Meanwhile, the Black Sea’s northeastern shores were dotted with ancient Greek colonies, such as Tyras, Pontic Olbia, and Hermonassa. Established as early as the 6th century BC, these colonies developed into important cultural and trading centers under Roman and later Byzantine rule. These cities continued to thrive until the 6th century AD, when Byzantine influence began to wane.

In the early 6th century AD, the Bosporan Kingdom on the Crimean Peninsula came under the rule of a Hunnic king named Gordas. Gordas maintained friendly relations with the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, but this ended when Gordas was killed in a local revolt around 527 AD. Justinian seized the opportunity to intervene, occupying the Bosporan Kingdom and further extending Byzantine influence over the region. However, even into the 12th century, Byzantine emperors continued to claim dominion over the Crimean region, known as the Cimmerian Bosporus.

== Middle Ages ==
=== Early Slavs ===

Following the power vacuum left by the fall of Hunnic and Gothic dominance, the Early Slavs began to expand over much of the territory that is now Ukraine during the 5th century, continuing their migration into the Balkans in the 6th century. The exact origins of the Early Slavs remain uncertain, though several theories suggest they may have originated near the Polesia region, a marshy area between modern-day Belarus and Ukraine. This period marks a transition from the Kyiv culture to the establishment of Slavic tribes across Eastern Europe.
In the 5th and 6th centuries, the Antes Union (a tribal confederation) is generally believed to have been situated in present-day Ukraine. The Antes are considered ancestors of several Slavic tribes that would later form the Ukrainians, including the Polans, Severians, Drevlians, White Croats, Dulebes, Ulichs, and Tivertsi. The migration of these tribes from Ukraine throughout the Balkans contributed to the foundation of several South Slavic nations, while northern migrations, reaching as far as Lake Ilmen, gave rise to the Ilmen Slavs, Krivichs, and Radimichs.

The collapse of the Antes Union in 602, following a devastating raid by the Pannonian Avars, led to a fragmentation of the early Slavic federation. Despite this, many of these tribes maintained their distinct identities until the formation of larger political entities in the early second millennium, such as Kievan Rus&#x27;, which began to consolidate Slavic lands.

The Early Slavs were primarily agrarian, relying on subsistence farming, and lived in semi-nomadic communities. Over time, they developed a complex social structure, with local chieftains leading tribal groups. They also practiced paganism, with a pantheon of gods tied to nature, such as Perun (god of thunder) and Dazhbog (sun god). By the time of the Antes Union&#x27;s decline, the cultural and religious practices of the Slavs had already begun to influence neighboring peoples, laying the groundwork for the Slavic cultural sphere that would emerge later in Eastern and Southeastern Europe.

=== Arrival of the Bulgars and Khazars ===
In the 7th century, the territory of modern Ukraine was at the core of the state of the Bulgars, often referred to as Old Great Bulgaria. This state, with its capital at Phanagoria (located in what is now the Taman Peninsula), controlled a significant part of the northern Black Sea region. The Bulgars, a semi-nomadic people from Central Asia, were known for their sophisticated society, military organization, and far-reaching influence.
By the end of the 7th century, the Bulgars faced increasing pressure from neighboring tribes and empires. Most of the Bulgar tribes migrated in various directions—some settled in the Balkans, where they eventually established the First Bulgarian Empire. Other groups moved towards the Volga region, forming Volga Bulgaria, which became a prominent center of trade and culture. The remaining parts of Old Great Bulgaria were eventually absorbed by the Khazars, another semi-nomadic people from Central Asia.

The Khazars founded the Khazar Khaganate, a powerful and influential state near the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus. The Khaganate&#x27;s territory expanded to include parts of modern-day western Kazakhstan, eastern Ukraine, southern Russia, and northern Azerbaijan. The Khazars were noted for their religious tolerance and political pragmatism, famously adopting Judaism as their state religion in the 8th century, although Christianity, Islam, and other faiths were also practiced within their borders.

The Khazars played a key role in the politics and economy of Eastern Europe and the Pontic–Caspian steppe. Their control over trade routes contributed to the establishment of the &quot;Pax Khazarica&quot;, a period of relative peace and stability that fostered safe long-distance trade. This stability allowed traders, including the Radhanite Jews, to operate along vast routes that stretched from China to the Byzantine Empire. These trade routes facilitated the exchange of goods, culture, and ideas across Eurasia.

=== Kievan Rus&#x27; (9th century–1240) ===
==== Origin and foundation of state ====

The origins of the Kievan state and the etymology of its name, Rus&#x27;, continue to be subjects of scholarly debate. One theory, often called the &#x27;Norman theory&#x27;, posits that the term Rus&#x27; originated from the Scandinavian Varangians, who were active in trade and military ventures across Eastern Europe in the early medieval period. Proponents of this theory argue that the Varangians, also known as the Rus&#x27;, initially brought a political and military influence that shaped the emerging state structure, with the term Rus&#x27; eventually becoming synonymous with the region and its people.

In contrast, the &#x27;anti-Norman theory&#x27; suggests that the term Rus&#x27; has indigenous Slavic roots, developing independently of Scandinavian influence. Advocates of this theory assert that Eastern Slavic tribes already had established political and social frameworks before any contact with the Varangians, and that these tribes were naturally progressing toward political consolidation. According to this perspective, the name Rus&#x27; could be linked to the Ros River, a historically significant waterway flowing through present-day Ukraine, which was home to various Slavic communities. In this view, Rus&#x27; may have referred to a collective identity tied to a specific geographic region or a union of native tribes, rather than to foreign invaders or rulers.
The first reliable mention of the Rus&#x27; dates back to the year 839 in the Frankish chronicle &quot;Annals of St. Bertin&quot;, where members of an embassy from the north, arriving in the Byzantine Empire, referred to themselves as Rus&#x27;. The second notable mention of the Rus&#x27; occurred in 860, when they launched a bold and unexpected naval raid on Constantinople. Commanding a fleet across the Black Sea, the Rus&#x27; forces struck at the very heart of the Byzantine Empire, quickly reaching the city’s outskirts. According to accounts from Greek eyewitnesses, the Rus&#x27; not only managed to pillage the suburbs of Constantinople but also instilled widespread fear among its residents. The Byzantine defenses were unprepared, allowing the Rus&#x27; to withdraw without significant resistance.

The earliest source about the history of the Dnieper Ukraine region is the &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; (or &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;), written no earlier than the 11th century. In its &#x27;legendary&#x27; part, it narrates the Rus&#x27; raid on Constantinople and the formation of a state centered in Kiev during the second half of the 9th century. The Chronicle, in particular, mentions the names of the leaders of the raid on Constantinople — Askold and Dir — and calls them retainers of the Scandinavian Rurik dynasty. According to the Chronicle, a representative of this dynasty, Oleg the Wise, allegedly came to Kiev from Novgorod in 882, killed Askold and Dir, and took control of the Kiev state. This narrative contains chronological errors—for example, it incorrectly dates the Constantinople raid to 867—and lacks corroboration from archaeological evidence, which suggests that Novgorod itself was only established in the 10th century. Therefore, modern historians view the Chronicle&#x27;s account of the 9th century as largely speculative and likely a later construction by the Chronicle&#x27;s author.
Scholars associate the state-building processes in the Middle Dnieper region with the emergence of the well-known trade route from Scandinavia to Constantinople, known as the &#x27;Route from the Varangians to the Greeks&#x27;. A significant section of this route ran along the Dnieper River, and Kiev was an important transshipment point, allowing control over trade along the Dnieper, Pripyat, and Desna rivers. The Middle Dnieper region began to serve as a political, cultural, and economic center for the East Slavic world. It eventually came to be known as the &quot;Rus&#x27; land&quot; in the narrow sense of this term. According to &quot;The Tale of Bygone Years&quot;, the East Slavic tribe of the Polans, inhabitants of the Middle Dnieper region, adopted the name &quot;Rus&quot;&#x27; for their land and were regarded as the most advanced among the East Slavs. Thus, they played a central role in forming a new tribal union centered around Kiev.

From the first half of the 10th century, the first confirmed ruler of the Kievan state, as documented in foreign sources, was Igor the Old, whom the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; identifies as a prince. Information in the Chronicle regarding governance during this period is considered relatively reliable. The princely retinue played a significant role in governance, accompanying rulers on campaigns and collecting tribute from subjugated local Slavic tribes. The collected tribute (such as furs, honey, hides, wax, and slaves) was mainly exported to Byzantium, with the proceeds used to purchase weapons, luxury goods, and wine—constituting the core of imports. When trade conditions no longer met the prince&#x27;s expectations, he led an unsuccessful campaign against Constantinople in 941, which eventually resulted in a new Rus-Byzantine trade treaty in 944. The &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; recounts Igor&#x27;s attempt to levy additional tribute from the subdued Slavs, which led to a rebellion by the Drevlians, who killed him in 945.
Following Igor&#x27;s death in 945, his widow, Princess Olga, assumed the role of regent for their young son, Sviatoslav, who was still too young to rule. Olga is best known for her calculated and fierce retaliation against the Drevlians, a campaign that culminated in the annexation of their lands into the expanding Kievan Rus&#x27;. Olga also implemented significant reforms, particularly by restructuring the tribute collection system known as &quot;poliudie&quot;. This new system made revenue collection more systematic and centralized, reducing the likelihood of rebellion by ensuring a more balanced distribution of power. In a landmark decision, Olga became the first ruler of Kievan Rus&#x27; to embrace Christianity around 957 during a diplomatic visit to Constantinople. However, despite her conversion, the state under her rule remained predominantly pagan, with Christianity gaining influence only later under her descendants.

When Sviatoslav assumed rule over Kievan Rus&#x27;, he launched an ambitious military expansion. His most notable achievement was the decisive defeat of the Khazar Khaganate, a once-dominant regional power that had controlled key trade routes for centuries. The fall of the Khazars opened opportunities for Kievan Rus&#x27; to extend its influence into the Caucasus and beyond. In addition to his campaigns in the east, Sviatoslav waged numerous battles against the Byzantine Empire, seeking to establish Kievan Rus&#x27; as a formidable power in the Balkans. His primary goal was to create a lasting base in Bulgaria, strengthening his strategic position in southeastern Europe. However, his ambitions in the Balkans were thwarted after a Byzantine counterattack. In 972, while returning from his Balkan campaign, Sviatoslav was ambushed and killed by the Pechenegs near the Dnieper River.
After Sviatoslav&#x27;s death, a power struggle ensued among his sons. Yaropolk, Sviatoslav&#x27;s eldest son, assumed the title of Grand Prince of Kiev and worked to consolidate power across the vast territory, leading to conflicts with his brothers. Oleg, Sviatoslav&#x27;s second son, governed the Drevlian lands, and rivalry between him and Yaropolk escalated into open warfare. During one of their clashes around 977, Oleg was killed, further intensifying the conflict. Initially, Vladimir, Sviatoslav&#x27;s youngest son, fled to avoid being entangled in the conflict. However, after Oleg&#x27;s death, he returned with a Varangian army. By 980, Vladimir had defeated Yaropolk and consolidated power, becoming the sole ruler of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

==== Golden Age and Christianisation ====

During the reign of Vladimir the Great, Kievan Rus&#x27; expanded significantly, notably through the conquest and annexation of Red Ruthenia, Transcarpathia, and Korsun. These territorial gains made Kievan Rus&#x27; the largest state in Europe at the time, covering over 800,000 square kilometers and boasting a population of more than 5 million. The socio-economic structure of Kievan Rus&#x27; was similar to that of other European states of the period, characterized by a natural economy, communal land ownership, and reliance on slash-and-burn agriculture, and animal husbandry.
Vladimir reformed local governance by abolishing the traditional tribal autonomies and installing his own appointed governors, further centralizing his authority. Under his rule, Kiev emerged as one of the wealthiest commercial centers in Europe during the 10th and 11th centuries, benefiting from its strategic location on trade routes and its growing political influence. Initially, Vladimir supported the worship of Slavic deities such as Perun. However, in 988, he made a historic decision to convert Kievan Rus&#x27; to Christianity, adopting Eastern Orthodoxy from the Byzantine Empire. He personally led the mass baptism of the people of Kiev in the Pochaina River and built the first stone church in Kievan Rus&#x27; — Church of the Tithes. He also introduced the &quot;Charter on Church Courts and Tithes&quot;, thereby securing a strong relationship between the church and state. Unlike the earlier attempts of his grandmother, Princess Olga, Vladimir&#x27;s reforms had a lasting impact, deeply influencing the religious and cultural development of the region.

Vladimir&#x27;s rule also saw administrative, monetary, and military reforms. He appointed governors and entrusted his sons with ruling major cities, also minted his own gold (Zolotnik) and silver (Serebryanik) coins, and granted borderlands to loyal vassals in exchange for military defense. To protect the realm, Vladimir oversaw the construction of an extensive system of defensive fortifications, known as the Serpent&#x27;s Walls, which stretched for 1,000 kilometers, safeguarding Kievan Rus&#x27; from external threats.
Despite these accomplishments, Kievan Rus&#x27; entered a turbulent period of internal strife following Vladimir&#x27;s death in 1015, as his sons fought for control. This era of internecine conflict lasted until 1019, when Yaroslav the Wise emerged victorious and assumed the throne. Ruling jointly with his brother Mstislav until 1036, Yaroslav presided over what is often regarded as the golden age of Kievan Rus&#x27;. One of Yaroslav&#x27;s key achievements was his decisive defeat of the Pechenegs, who had long been a threat to the state. To commemorate this victory, Yaroslav ordered the construction of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, a structure that still stands as a symbol of this prosperous era. He also founded the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra and supported the election of Hilarion of Kiev as the Kyiv Metropolitan, marking a significant step in the independence of the Kievan church. Yaroslav&#x27;s reign was also notable for the introduction of the first written legal code — &quot;Rus&#x27; Truth&quot;, which established a foundation for legal governance in the state. Additionally, Yaroslav engaged in extensive marriage diplomacy, forming alliances by arranging marriages between his daughters and European royalty. However, after Yaroslav&#x27;s death, Kievan Rus&#x27; began to fragment, as his sons divided the territory among themselves, leading to further internecine conflicts and the eventual decline of centralized power.

==== Feudal fragmentation ====
The feudal fragmentation of Kievan Rus&#x27; began in the late 11th century, driven by a complex interplay of internal and external factors. One significant factor was the rotational succession system, allowing power to pass among male relatives instead of directly from father to son. This system often sparked conflicts, as competing claims to power emerged. With princes often granted specific territories, autonomous principalities began to emerge clearly. Regional cities such as Chernihiv, Polotsk, and Novgorod gained power and asserted their independence, with local elites increasing their influence. By this time, the authority of the Grand Prince of Kiev was notably weakening. Regional princes, bolstered by local resources and armies, began to resist central control. Additionally, the vast geography and economic diversity of Rus&#x27; impeded unity, as various regions developed their own trade routes and systems. External threats from nomadic groups, such as the Pechenegs and Polovtsy (Cumans), further exacerbated regionalism, compelling local rulers to focus on defending their territories.
After Yaroslav the Wise&#x27;s death, his sons divided the lands, which significantly accelerated political fragmentation. Although his succession plan aimed to prevent conflict, it ultimately sowed the seeds of feudal division. The Council of Liubech, convened by several princes, including Vladimir Monomakh, sought to settle disputes and clarify the inheritance of principalities. This agreement formalized Kievan Rus&#x27;s division into regional hereditary principalities, thereby legalizing fragmentation. The adage &quot;Let everyone hold his own&quot; emerged, signifying that each prince would govern his own territory without interference from others.

Vladimir Monomakh, who served as Grand Prince of Kiev from 1113 to 1125, is remembered as one of Kievan Rus&#x27; most capable leaders. He ascended the throne amid internal strife and external threats, yet worked diligently to stabilize the fragmented territories of Rus&#x27;. Monomakh&#x27;s reign achieved relative unity through efforts to reduce feuds among princes and reinforce central authority. His military successes, particularly against the Polovtsy (Cumans), secured the region&#x27;s borders. Diplomatically, he forged strong ties with Europe, notably through his marriage to Gytha of Wessex, the daughter of English King Harold II. As an educated ruler, Monomakh authored &quot;The Instruction of Vladimir Monomakh&quot;, offering insights on governance, morality, and leadership. His reign is often regarded as one of the last periods of unity before Rus&#x27; descended further into division.

Monomakh&#x27;s son, Mstislav the Great, preserved some unity during his reign from 1125 to 1132. However, following his death, the principality fractured. The division of lands among Monomakh&#x27;s sons and other relatives resulted in multiple competing power centers. The process of feudal fragmentation marked a turning point in the history of Rus&#x27;, culminating in its eventual decline and the rise of smaller, more independent states. These would later evolve into the medieval powers of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, the Principality of Polotsk, the Novgorod Republic, and others.

==== Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; ====

In 1222, a new wave of nomads—the warlike Mongols—arrived in the Black Sea steppes and defeated the Polovtsians as part of the Mongol Empire&#x27;s westward expansion. The Polovtsians, who had family ties with the Rus&#x27; princes, turned to Rus&#x27; for help. A joint Rus&#x27;-Polovtsian force marched into the steppes, where the Battle of the Kalka River took place in 1223. Following the battle, the Mongols retreated eastward for approximately 15 years.

In the late 1230s, the Mongols returned with significantly larger forces under the leadership of Batu Khan and his general Subutai. The Mongols first attacked the eastern regions of the state, using superior siege tactics to overwhelm local defenses. Between 1239 and 1240, the Mongols shifted their focus to the southern territories. In 1240, they laid siege to Kiev, which ultimately fell after a brutal assault, marking the final collapse of Kievan Rus&#x27; as a unified political entity.

As a result of this invasion, Kievan Rus&#x27; was extensively destroyed, depopulated, and fragmented. Following their conquest, the Mongols established dominion over the region through the Golden Horde, transforming most of the Rus&#x27; principalities into tributary states. Under Mongol rule, the Rus&#x27; were required to pay heavy taxes and submit to Mongol authority. The invasion severely stunted the region&#x27;s political, cultural, and economic development, and the effects of Mongol domination reverberated for centuries. Despite its devastation, the Eastern Orthodox Church played an important role in preserving cultural identity during Mongol rule.

==== Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia ====
The Principality—later the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia (Ruthenia)—emerged from the disintegration of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Its rulers continued the political and cultural legacy of Kiev, preserving the traditions and governance of the Rus&#x27; state even as Kiev fell to Mongol control. Previously, Vladimir the Great had established the cities of Halych and Volodymyr as regional capitals, setting the foundation for future political entities in the region. The area was originally inhabited by the Dulebes, Tivertsi, and White Croats tribes. Initially, Volhynia and Galicia existed as separate principalities, each ruled by descendants of Yaroslav the Wise. Galicia was governed by the Rostislavich dynasty, while Volhynia was initially ruled by the Igorevichs and eventually by the Iziaslavich dynasty. During the reign of Yaroslav Osmomysl (1153–1187), Galicia expanded its influence, extending as far as the Black Sea.

Rivalry between the rulers of these principalities often revolved around efforts to assert dominance over one another. This conflict was finally resolved by Roman the Great (1197–1205), who not only succeeded in uniting Galicia and Volhynia under his rule but also briefly extended his authority over Kiev. Roman&#x27;s consolidation of power laid the groundwork for the rise of the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia, which became a significant political force in the region.
Following Roman&#x27;s death, a period of unrest ensued, lasting until his son Daniel Romanovich reclaimed the throne in 1238. Daniel successfully restored his father&#x27;s state, including Kiev. In 1240, the Mongol Empire, led by Batu Khan, unleashed devastating invasions across Kievan Rus&#x27;. Cities like Kiev were sacked, leaving much of the region in ruins. Daniel&#x27;s decisive victory at the Battle of Yaroslavl in 1245 ended internal conflicts and firmly secured his control over the state. By 1246, Daniel was compelled to recognize Mongol supremacy to safeguard his state. Though this submission was humiliating, it allowed Daniel to retain some degree of autonomy, provided he paid tribute to the Mongol khan.

Despite this subjugation, Daniel remained determined to free Ruthenia from Mongol dominance. He sought support from Western Europe, forging diplomatic ties with the Papacy, Poland, Hungary, and the Holy Roman Empire. In 1253, Daniel was crowned King of Ruthenia () by a papal legate in Drohiczyn, receiving formal recognition from Pope Innocent IV. This coronation symbolized Ruthenia&#x27;s alignment with Western Europe and its Christian identity, while still adhering to the Orthodox faith. The crowning also carried the hope of an anti-Mongol alliance, though such a coalition never materialized due to political divisions in Western Europe. King Daniel also founded numerous cities that became hubs of trade, culture, and military strength. Among his most notable achievements were the establishments of Lviv, named after his son Lev, and Kholm. These urban centers not only revitalized the kingdom&#x27;s economy but also helped Daniel consolidate his political authority over the region.

After King Daniel Romanovych&#x27;s death in 1264, the kingdom was inherited by his son, Lev Danylovych. Lev I ruled from 1269 to 1301 and relocated the capital from Kholm to Lviv. He continued his father&#x27;s policies of defending the kingdom against external threats, particularly from the Mongols, while also striving to maintain alliances with Poland and Lithuania to counterbalance Mongol influence. Although Lev managed to preserve the state&#x27;s territorial integrity, the kingdom&#x27;s power gradually eroded under the relentless pressure from the Mongol Golden Horde and ongoing internal political challenges. Following Lev&#x27;s death in 1301, his son, Yuri Lvovych, ascended the throne and ruled until 1308. During his reign, Yuri I succeeded in maintaining relative stability, yet the kingdom&#x27;s political position had significantly weakened compared to the time of Daniel. Despite his efforts, Yuri&#x27;s reign was short-lived, and after his death, the kingdom entered a period of fragmentation.
Yuri&#x27;s sons, Andrew and Lev II, attempted to co-rule, but their efforts to sustain the kingdom&#x27;s unity and strength ultimately failed. The Mongol Golden Horde continued to exert substantial influence over the weakened Kingdom of Ruthenia throughout the 14th century. After the deaths of the co-rulers around 1323, the kingdom found itself without strong leadership. Yuri II Boleslav, the last ruler of the Kingdom of Ruthenia, took power following the demise of the Romanovych line. Reigning from 1323 to 1340, he was a member of the Polish Piast dynasty, chosen as king due to his maternal connection to the Ruthenian royal family—his mother, Maria, was the daughter of Lev I. Upon ascending the throne, Boleslav converted to Orthodox Christianity and adopted the name Yuriy to garner support from the local Orthodox nobility. However, his reign was fraught with tension due to his Catholic background, which clashed with the predominantly Orthodox Ruthenian elite. During his rule, Yuriy II struggled to balance the competing interests of Poland, Lithuania, and the Mongol Golden Horde, while also introducing pro-Catholic policies that alienated the local nobility. His rule culminated in his assassination in 1340 by Ruthenian nobles discontented with his leadership. His death triggered a fierce power struggle between Poland and Lithuania for control over the region. Soon after, Galicia was annexed by Poland, and Volhynia fell under Lithuanian rule, marking the end of the independent Kingdom of Ruthenia.

=== Foreign domination ===

From the 13th century onwards, parts of Ukraine’s Black Sea called Genoese Gazaria came under the influence of the Republic of Genoa, which established fortified trading colonies. These included key settlements such as Caffa (modern Feodosia), Soldaia (modern Sudak), and others in today’s Odesa Oblast. These fortresses, heavily guarded by Genoese garrisons, functioned as hubs for maritime trade and ensured Genoa&#x27;s control over Black Sea commerce. The Genoese dominance, however, faced challenges from neighboring powers and ended with the Ottoman conquest in 1475.

In 1322, Pope John XXII established a Catholic diocese in Caffa (modern-day Feodosia), marking the only Catholic stronghold within Mongol-controlled territories. It served as a central religious authority from the Balkans to the capital of the Golden Horde, Sarai. The Genoese settlements were not only economic centers but also a point of cultural and religious interaction between Europe, the Mongol Empire, and the Middle East.
By the mid-14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania expanded into the territories of modern Ukraine. After the decisive Battle of the Blue Waters against the Golden Horde (1362/63), Lithuania annexed Polotsk, Volhynia, Chernihiv, and Kyiv. Lithuanian rulers adhered to the principle “We do not disturb the old, nor do we introduce the new”, which allowed local Ruthenian (Ukrainian) traditions, religion, and administration to remain largely intact. The Lithuanian rulers styled themselves as “rulers of Rus’”, integrating Ruthenian traditions and governance into their system. This integration included Ruthenian aristocrats, like the Olelkovich family, who became influential in the Lithuanian administration. Old Church Slavonic and Ruthenian served as primary administrative languages alongside Latin.

Simultaneously, Poland began asserting influence over western Ukraine. Red Ruthenia, parts of Volhynia, and Podolia were incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland, and the Polish monarch adopted the title &quot;lord and heir of Ruthenia&quot; (). Meanwhile, Kingdom of Hungary also maintained influence, particularly over Zakarpattia (Transcarpathia) and parts of Bessarabia. The Hungarian Crown controlled these regions, fostering Magyarization and Catholic influence while integrating them into the Hungary’s political and economic system.

Since the 14th century, Poland and Lithuania had developed a unique and evolving relationship, often defined by dynastic unions, military alliances, and shared geopolitical interests, particularly in countering external threats. These included the aggressive expansion of the Teutonic Knights in the Baltic region and the rise of the Principality of Moscow to the east. The need for mutual support in the face of these common enemies gradually led the two states toward closer cooperation. This relationship reached a decisive turning point with the Union of Krewo in 1385, which marked the beginning of a new political era. Through the marriage of Jadwiga of Poland, the Queen of Poland, and Władysław II Jagiełło, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, the Lithuanian Grand Duchy was brought under Polish influence. This union was not just a political arrangement but a dynastic consolidation, with Jagiełło converting to Christianity and agreeing to unite Lithuania with Poland under his rule. This union established the Jagiellonian dynasty, which would go on to rule both Poland and Lithuania for several generations. The creation of this shared monarchy laid the foundation for an increasingly intertwined relationship between the two states, leading to greater cooperation in military, political, and cultural matters.

In the early 15th century, tensions within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Ruthenia and Samogitia over the governance of the Rus&#x27; lands intensified. These tensions escalated into a power struggle following the death of Grand Duke Vytautas in 1430. Vytautas had been a powerful and unifying figure, and his passing left a power vacuum that deepened divisions within the Lithuanian elite. Two main contenders for the throne emerged: Švitrigaila, who had the support of the Orthodox Rus&#x27; nobility, and Sigismund Kęstutaitis, who represented the Catholic Lithuanian elite. In 1432, Sigismund Kęstutaitis declared himself the new Grand Duke of Lithuania. To consolidate his rule and gain favor with the Rus&#x27; lands, he proclaimed the creation of a new political entity—the . This new formation was intended to include several important regions, such as Volhynia, Podolia, Siveria, Berestia, and Kyivshchyna, with Kyiv as its capital. Despite this declaration, Švitrigaila remained formally the head of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and sought to transform the Rus&#x27; lands into an independent state under his control. His ambition to sever the ties with the rest of the Grand Duchy sparked a civil war that raged from 1432 to 1435, plunging Lithuania into internal conflict.
Švitrigaila&#x27;s forces, which included early Cossack, sought external support from the Teutonic Order, which had its own interests in weakening both Poland and Lithuania. The Teutonic Order&#x27;s involvement further complicated the political situation. However, Sigismund Kęstutaitis found strong backing from Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), as well as from the majority of the Lithuanian nobility. This external support proved pivotal in the conflict, tipping the scales in Sigismund&#x27;s favor. The turning point in the war came with the Battle of Wiłkomierz (modern-day Ukmergė, Lithuania) on September 1, 1435. This battle was one of the largest and most decisive military engagements in Eastern Europe during the 15th century. Švitrigaila&#x27;s forces were decisively defeated, suffering a crushing blow that effectively ended the Grand Principality of Rus&#x27;. The defeat led to the collapse of Švitrigaila&#x27;s short-lived state and ensured the continuation of Lithuanian rule over the Rus&#x27; lands. With the victory, Sigismund Kęstutaitis solidified his power as Grand Duke, and the Rus&#x27; territories were once again integrated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, these lands would now be firmly under Lithuanian control, with no 
significant autonomy for the Rus&#x27; people. The failure of the Grand Principality of Rus&#x27; also marked a significant shift in the governance of the region, as the aspirations of the Rus&#x27; nobility for greater independence were suppressed.

Southwestern Crimea saw the emergence of the Principality of Theodoro, also known as Gothia, a Byzantine successor state. Centered in Doros (modern Mangup), Theodoro was a multi-ethnic entity populated by Greeks, Goths, Alans, and others. Its rulers maintained close ties with the Byzantine Empire and the Empire of Trebizond. The principality acted as a buffer between Genoese colonies and the expanding Crimean Khanate. Despite its strong fortifications, Theodoro was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1475, as the Ottomans sought full dominance over the Black Sea region.

The increasing dominance of the Polish nobility over Ukrainian lands in the late 15th century sparked resistance, most notably Mukha’s Rebellion in 1490. Led by Petro Mukha and supported by Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, the uprising involved early Cossacks, Hutsuls, and Romanians (Moldavians). Mukha’s forces captured several towns in Pokuttya and advanced toward Lviv, though they failed to take the city. The rebellion, while ultimately suppressed, revealed growing dissatisfaction among Ukrainians under foreign rule and foreshadowed future uprisings in the region.

As the Golden Horde declined in the 15th century, the Crimean Khanate emerged as a dominant power in the southern Ukrainian steppe. Centered around the city of Bakhchisarai, the Khanate controlled much of the Black Sea coastline, including key ports and strategic territories in what is today southern Ukraine. This rise to power marked a significant shift in the region, as the Crimean Khanate not only played a key military and political role but also became a vital player in the economy of the Black Sea and beyond.
From the early 16th century to the late 18th century, the Crimean Khanate was deeply involved in the region’s slave trade, which became one of its main economic drivers. The Khanate, often acting as an intermediary between the steppes and the Ottoman Empire, exported an estimated 2 million slaves to slavery in the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East between 1500 and 1700. These slaves, many of whom were captured in raids on neighboring lands, were primarily sold to the Ottoman Empire, where they were used in various sectors, including the military, households, and harems.

Despite its growing power, the Crimean Khanate remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire throughout much of its history. This relationship provided the Khanate with military support and protection, but also limited its autonomy. The Crimean Khanate’s role as a vassal did not diminish its influence, however, and it continued to exert significant control over the Black Sea region until the late 18th century.

==Early modern period==
===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

After the Union of Lublin in 1569, which united the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Ukrainian lands transitioned under Polish administration, becoming part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The union was driven by the need to counter external threats, primarily the growing aggression of Tsardom of Moscow and persistent raids by the Teutonic Order, prompting both states to consolidate their resources and strengthen their defenses. This political shift marked a significant transformation of Ukraine&#x27;s social, economic, and cultural landscape. Polish authorities initiated large-scale colonization efforts, resulting in the foundation of numerous new towns and villages, particularly in the steppe regions. Settlers brought new legal norms, governance practices, and economic models, integrating Ukrainian lands more closely into the Commonwealth&#x27;s political system.
At the same time, Renaissance ideas began to permeate Ukrainian society, driven by the spread of new schools and educational institutions, which were often established by the Jesuits. The arrival of Polish settlers in large numbers led to cultural assimilation. Over time, a significant portion of the Ukrainian nobility became &#x27;polonized&#x27;, adopting Polish customs, language, and converting to Roman Catholicism. However, the majority of Ruthenian-speaking peasants remained loyal to the Eastern Orthodox Church, which caused growing social and religious tensions. Polish influence extended not only politically but also culturally. Some polonized Ukrainian nobles, such as Stanisław Orzechowski, made notable contributions to Polish intellectual and cultural life, writing influential works on theology, law, and politics. These changes contributed to the fragmentation of Ukrainian society, as the gap between the Catholic, Polish-speaking nobility and the Orthodox, Ruthenian-speaking peasants widened, creating the foundations for future conflicts.

The incorporation of Kyiv, Volhynia, Podolia, and Bratslav lands into the Crown also strengthened internal connections between various Ukrainian regions. New trade routes and urban centers facilitated greater economic, social, and cultural interaction across these previously fragmented territories, fostering regional cohesion. However, despite the spread of Polish culture and governance, the Ukrainian population maintained a distinct identity rooted in Orthodox traditions and Ruthenian language, which became a key factor in their resistance to cultural assimilation.

At the same time, the harsh conditions imposed on Ruthenian peasants by the Polish nobility sparked widespread resistance. As serfdom expanded and economic exploitation intensified, many peasants fled to the borderlands of the Dnipro region, seeking freedom and a better life. These frontier settlers became known as Cossacks, forming a distinct social and military group known for their martial prowess, independence, and deep ties to the Orthodox faith. The Cossacks quickly gained a reputation as skilled warriors, adept at defending the southeastern borders of the Commonwealth from Tatar raids. Recognizing their military value, the Polish authorities enlisted Cossacks into the Commonwealth’s army, particularly for the defense of frontier regions, and granted them limited privileges through the creation of the Registered Cossacks in the late 16th century. Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, one of the most prominent Cossack leaders, played a decisive role in the Battle of Khotyn in 1621, where the Commonwealth, with Cossack support, repelled a massive Ottoman army. His leadership and diplomatic efforts also strengthened ties with the Orthodox Church, as he sought to restore the Church’s influence in Ukrainian society.
However, despite their significant contributions to the Commonwealth’s military victories, the Cossacks were denied substantial political or social autonomy. The Szlachta (Polish nobility), which dominated the Commonwealth’s political system, viewed the Cossacks as a disruptive and uncontrollable force, refusing to recognize them as a distinct social class. Instead, the nobility made repeated attempts to reduce the Cossacks to the status of serfs, depriving them of their privileges and freedoms. This ongoing marginalization and denial of rights led to a series of Cossack uprisings, as they sought to defend their autonomy, way of life, and religious identity. Notable rebellions included the Kosiński Uprising (1591-1593) and the Nalyvaiko Uprising (1594-1596), both of which were brutally suppressed by the Polish authorities. These rebellions, however, underscored the growing discontent among the Cossacks and highlighted the tension between the Commonwealth’s central government and the frontier population.

By the early 17th century, the situation became increasingly volatile, with Cossack demands for recognition of their rights being continuously ignored. The Commonwealth&#x27;s refusal to integrate the Cossacks politically and respect their distinct cultural and religious identity ultimately set the stage for larger conflicts, most notably the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648, also known as the Cossack–Polish War, which profoundly reshaped the political landscape of Eastern Europe.

=== Cossack era ===
==== Cossack Hetmanate (1649–1764) ====

The Cossack Hetmanate, also known as the Hetmanate of Ukraine, was a self-governing Cossack state that existed between 1649 and 1764. It arose during a particularly volatile era in Eastern European history, following the seismic upheaval of the Khmelnytsky Uprising. This revolt, led by the charismatic and astute military leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky, sought to liberate Ukrainian lands from the dominion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The rebellion not only destabilized one of Europe’s most prominent states at the time but also triggered a broader period of chaos in the region, known in Ukrainian history as the &quot;Ruin&quot;, while in Polish historiography it is referred to as &quot;the Deluge&quot;.
The establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate in 1649 marked a pivotal shift in the political landscape of Eastern Europe. Officially recognized through the Treaty of Zboriv that same year, the Hetmanate emerged as a semi-autonomous entity within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Yet, this fragile self-governance was immediately tested by a turbulent geopolitical environment. The state found itself entangled in a web of diplomatic and military conflicts involving major regional powers, including the Ottoman Empire, the Commonwealth, the Crimean Khanate, and the Tsardom of Moscow. For these competing entities, the Hetmanate was not just a potential ally, but also a strategic prize, which complicated its quest for sovereignty and stability.

As ruler of the Hetmanate, Khmelnytsky engaged in state-building across multiple spheres: military, administration, finance, economics, and culture. He invested the Zaporozhian Host under the leadership of its hetman with supreme power in the new Ruthenian state, and he unified all the spheres of Ukrainian society under his authority. This involved building a government system and a developed military and civilian administration out of Cossack officers and Ruthenian nobles, as well as the establishment of an elite within the Cossack Hetman state.

In 1654, under the continuous pressure of Poland and in pursuit of a more secure route to sovereignty, the Cossack leadership, headed by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, entered into the Pereyaslav Agreement with the Tsardom of Russia. This pact positioned the Hetmanate under the Russian protection, signaling a significant shift in the region’s balance of power. While the agreement initially promised mutual military support and guaranteed a degree of autonomy for the Cossacks, it also laid the groundwork for Russia&#x27;s gradual encroachment on Ukrainian governance. Over time, the aspirations of the Hetmanate for true independence were systematically undermined, as the Tsardom’s ambitions to consolidate control over the territory took precedence.
Efforts to reclaim autonomy and negotiate favorable terms with neighboring powers continued, culminating in the 1658 Treaty of Hadiach. This ambitious agreement aimed to elevate the Hetmanate to the status of the Grand Principality of Rus&#x27;, an equal partner within the Commonwealth alongside Poland and Lithuania. While the treaty represented a significant step toward reconciliation, it was ultimately derailed by fierce Russian opposition and deep-seated divisions within the Ukrainian leadership. Moreover, the agreement failed to stabilize the region, as ongoing conflicts, including Russian military campaigns and internal unrest, plunged the Hetmanate into over a decade of turmoil, leaving its aspirations for autonomy unfulfilled.

The Truce of Andrusovo in 1667 marked a pivotal moment in Ukrainian history, as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia formalized an agreement to partition the Hetmanate&#x27;s territories along the Dnieper River. Under the terms of the treaty, Right-Bank Ukraine was returned to Polish control, while Left-Bank Ukraine, including Kyiv, was ceded to Russia. Although the Hetmanate retained a nominal degree of autonomy on the Left Bank, this autonomy was heavily constrained by Russian oversight. The division not only symbolized the beginning of a new long-term foreign domination of Ukrainian lands, but also violated the unity of the Cossack state. This fragmentation further weakened the Hetmanate&#x27;s capacity to resist external pressures and maintain its independence, leaving it increasingly vulnerable to the ambitions of neighboring powers.

The late 17th century was characterized by civil strife, foreign intervention, and territorial shifts. From 1657 to 1686, the region was embroiled in nearly constant conflict, with neighboring powers, including the Ottoman Empire, Poland, and Russia, capitalizing on Ukraine&#x27;s vulnerability. During this period, Hetman Petro Doroshenko, a prominent Cossack leader, sought to consolidate control over key territories such as Kyiv and Bratslav. However, his ambitions were thwarted as these areas fell under Turkish occupation, further complicating the geopolitical landscape.
In the broader context, the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699 played a pivotal role in redefining territorial control. It resulted in the return of much of the land previously held by the Ottomans to Polish authority. Despite this, Ukrainian Cossack forces, especially in the frontier regions of Zaporizhzhia and Sloboda Ukraine, managed to maintain a degree of autonomy. Semi-independent Cossack republics in these areas continued to challenge both Polish and Russian dominance, asserting their independence and preserving distinct cultural and political identities.

In addition to political turbulence, the Hetmanate played a pivotal role in the cultural and intellectual development of both Ukraine and Russia during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Ukrainian clerics, scholars, and intellectuals, many of whom were educated at the esteemed Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, served as key agents of cultural exchange and reform. Their influence was particularly pronounced during the reign of Peter the Great, as they introduced new ideas and approaches that helped modernize Russian society. Figures such as Theophan Prokopovich and Stefan Yavorsky, both leading members of the Most Holy Synod, played an important role in shaping religious and educational reforms in Russia. The intellectual movement often referred to as the &#x27;Ukrainian school&#x27; left a lasting imprint on Russian literature, theology, and pedagogy, becoming a dominant force in the region&#x27;s cultural landscape.

A critical turning point in Ukraine&#x27;s religious history occurred in 1686, when the Metropolis of Kyiv was annexed by the Moscow Patriarchate. This event symbolized the consolidation of Moscow&#x27;s influence over Ukrainian religious and cultural life. This annexation was a significant step towards the gradual erosion of Ukrainian ecclesiastical independence. Nonetheless, the Hetmanate’s leadership continued to assert their autonomy, navigating complex political realities to safeguard their unique identity and governance. The interplay between cooperation and resistance defined this era, highlighting Ukraine&#x27;s dual role as both a cultural sponsor of Moscovy&#x27;s reforms and a defender of its own sovereignty.
The Hetmanate reached its peak of independence under the leadership of Hetman Ivan Mazepa, a complex and ambitious figure in Ukrainian history. Seeking to assert the autonomy of the Hetmanate, Mazepa pursued an alliance with the Swedish Empire during the Great Northern War (1700–1721), hoping to break free from Russian dominance. His decision to align with Charles XII of Sweden was a bold but perilous move, rooted in the desire to safeguard Ukrainian sovereignty and escape the tightening grip of Moscow.

The turning point came in 1708, when the Moscovy’s army, under orders from Tsar Peter I, sacked the Hetmanate’s capital city, Baturyn. The brutal assault resulted in the massacre of thousands of defenders and civilians, with many burned alive or executed in other horrific ways. This act of retribution was a devastating blow to Mazepa’s efforts, as it not only destroyed the administrative and military center of the Hetmanate but also served as a warning to other potential dissenters. Mazepa&#x27;s rebellion culminated in the catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Poltava in 1709, where the combined Swedish-Ukrainian forces were decisively crushed by Peter’s army. The aftermath of Poltava marked the end of Mazepa’s aspirations for Ukrainian independence and significantly tightened Russia&#x27;s control over the Hetmanate. The rebellion’s failure also signaled a shift in the balance of power in Eastern Europe, consolidating Russia’s dominance in the region and diminishing the Hetmanate’s autonomy.

After the defeat at Poltava, Ivan Skoropadsky led the Hetmanate (1708–1722) during a challenging period of diminishing autonomy. While he sought to navigate the growing pressures from Russia, his efforts were significantly undermined in 1722 when Peter I established the Little Russian Collegium. This administrative body, composed largely of imperial officials, was tasked with supervising the Hetmanate’s governance, effectively curtailing Skoropadsky’s authority and undermining traditional Cossack institutions. His death in 1722 left the Hetmanate vulnerable to further imperial centralization. Following Skoropadsky’s death, Pavlo Polubotok, serving as acting Hetman, attempted to resist Moscow’s encroachments. Polubotok appealed to Peter I to honor the Hetmanate’s earlier agreements, particularly those guaranteeing autonomy. However, his resistance led to his arrest and imprisonment in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where he died in 1724. Polubotok’s fate symbolized the futility of overt resistance during this phase, as the imperial government tightened its grip on the region.
A brief resurgence of autonomy occurred under Danylo Apostol (1727–1734), whose election marked a temporary relaxation of imperial policies following Peter I’s death. Apostol negotiated limited autonomy for the Hetmanate, securing greater control over local taxation and governance. He also implemented administrative and judicial reforms aimed at strengthening internal stability. Despite these achievements, Apostol’s death led to another period of direct imperial administration under the Governing Council of the Hetman Office, a body dominated by Russian officials. This period (1734–1750) deepened the integration of the Hetmanate into the imperial administrative structure.

In 1750, the Hetmanate was restored under Kyrylo Rozumovsky, a politically savvy leader with close ties to the Russian court. Rozumovsky sought to modernize the Hetmanate by reforming its administration, judiciary, and military while working to strengthen its autonomy. He relocated the Hetmanate’s capital to Hlukhiv, transforming it into a political and cultural center. Rozumovsky also initiated ambitious projects, including plans to establish a university, reflecting his vision of the Hetmanate as a semi-autonomous, modernized polity within the Russian Empire. However, his growing influence and calls for greater independence alarmed Catherine the Great, who was determined to centralize power.

In 1764, Catherine the Great formally abolished the Hetmanate, transferring its governance to the Little Russian Collegium. This move marked the end of the Hetmanate’s semi-autonomous status and its complete incorporation into the administrative structure of the Russian Empire. The abolition not only dismantled the Hetmanate’s unique political and military institutions but also signified the culmination of a broader imperial strategy to suppress regional autonomy in favor of centralized governance.

==== Liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich ====

During the 18th century, the Russian Empire transitioned from providing nominal &quot;protection&quot; to exerting direct control over central Ukraine, progressively eroding the autonomy of the Cossacks. The Cossack uprisings, which had once been directed against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, now shifted focus to the Russian authorities. By the late 18th century, these uprisings had largely subsided, their potency undermined by the overwhelming might of the Russian Empire and deep divisions within the Cossack leadership.
The Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774 marked a pivotal moment for the Ukrainian Cossacks and their role within the Russian Empire. The Cossacks had provided crucial support during the war, significantly contributing to Russian victories. The conflict culminated in the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, which granted Russia significant territorial acquisitions along the Black Sea coast, further consolidating its influence in the region. This success reduced the strategic importance of the Zaporozhian Sich, as the borderlands the Cossacks had long defended were now firmly under Russian control. The geopolitical realignment weakened the Cossacks’ traditional role, setting the stage for their eventual demise.

In 1775, Empress Catherine the Great took decisive action to eliminate what she perceived as a potential threat to her centralized rule. The Zaporozhian Sich, with its semi-autonomous status and militarized society, stood as a symbol of independence that clashed with the empire’s drive toward unification. Acting on her orders, General Peter Tekeli led a massive military force to suppress the Sich. On June 15, 1775, Tekeli’s forces, composed of 45,000 troops—including 8 cavalry regiments, 10 infantry regiments, 20 hussar squadrons, 17 pike squadrons, and 13 squadrons of Don Cossacks—overwhelmed the Sich. Defended by a mere 3,000 Cossacks, the Sich fell with little resistance. The destruction of the Zaporozhian Sich marked the end of an era, effectively dismantling one of the last vestiges of Ukrainian self-rule.

The last Kosh Otaman, Petro Kalnyshevsky, was arrested and exiled to the Solovetsky Islands in the far north, where he spent the remainder of his life in harsh conditions, dying in captivity. Following the destruction, a smaller group of Cossacks fled to the lands of the Ottoman Empire, settling beyond the Danube, where they formed the Danubian Sich. Others relocated to the Kuban region in the Russian Empire, where they helped establish the Kuban Cossack Host. However, the majority of the Ukrainian Cossacks were deported to remote parts of the Russian Empire, including Siberia, in a move that sought to break their power and disperse their population. In addition to the loss of Cossack autonomy, the Russian troops seized over 30,000 documents, along with weapons and other valuables, representing the history of Ukraine from the 16th to the 18th centuries. These items were stored in the fortress of St. Elizabeth, which had been the primary military base of the Russian Imperial Army in Ukraine. These historical artifacts remained in St. Elizabeth’s fortress until they were eventually transferred to Kyiv in 1918, providing valuable insights into the rich history of the Ukrainian Cossacks.
Meanwhile, in right-bank Ukraine, dissatisfaction with Polish rule had been growing for decades. Increased corvée (forced labor) obligations, along with the abuse of power by Polish magnates, nobles, and their Jewish stewards, led to widespread unrest. The peasants, many of whom were Orthodox Christians, resented the imposition of taxes and labor on their lands, as well as the presence of Roman Catholic and Uniate clergy. The resulting discontent gave rise to a series of Haidamak uprisings, in which bands of rebels attacked and looted towns, targeting the estates of nobles, clergy, and Jewish populations. Major uprisings occurred in 1734, 1750, and the largest—known as Koliyivschyna—took place in 1768. This revolt was a culmination of decades of accumulated grievances, sparked by rumors of impending changes in religious and social policies that threatened the Orthodox community. The rebellion saw widespread attacks across towns and estates, resulting in significant loss of life and property. While the Haidamaks initially achieved some successes, the uprising was ultimately brutally suppressed by Polish forces with the assistance of Russian troops.

By the end of the century, Catherine the Great’s policies had reshaped the political landscape of Ukraine. The Cossack&#x27;s role in defending the borderlands was no longer necessary, as the Russian Empire now controlled the Black Sea and Crimea. In 1783, the Crimean Khanate was formally annexed by Russia, cementing control over the northern Black Sea region. A few years earlier, in 1778, a mass emigration of Christians from Crimea occurred, further altering the demographic balance of the region. Finally, in 1793, following the Second Partition of Poland, right-bank Ukraine was officially incorporated into the Russian Empire. By the end of Catherine’s reign, most of Ukraine had fallen under Russian control, bringing an end to the centuries-old struggle for autonomy and leaving the Ukrainian people under the rule of the imperial power.

== Modern history ==
=== Empires and Ukrainian National Revival ===

Under the reign of Alexander I (1801–1825), the Russian presence in Ukraine was largely limited to the imperial army and its bureaucracy. However, by the reign of Nicholas I (1825–1855), Russia had established a centralized administration in Ukraine. After suppressing the November Uprising of 1830, the tsarist regime implemented Russification policies, particularly on the Right-bank Ukraine. These policies not only suppressed the Ukrainian language but also aimed to weaken local traditions by emphasizing loyalty to the Russian Orthodox Church, which actively promoted Russification in contrast to the Uniate Church&#x27;s earlier influence in Western Ukraine.

The 1861 emancipation of serfs had a profound effect on Ukraine, as 42% of its population were serfs. By the late 19th century, heavy taxes, rapid population growth, and land shortages led to widespread impoverishment among the peasantry. Many rural Ukrainians began migrating to cities, where industrialization and urban development created new economic opportunities but also fostered a growing sense of class consciousness. The construction of the first railway track in 1866 not only integrated Ukraine’s economy into the Russian imperial system but also facilitated the mobility of workers and goods. Despite their hardships, Ukrainian peasants and workers contributed significantly to the empire’s economy, with the steppe regions producing 20% of the world&#x27;s wheat and 80% of the empire&#x27;s sugar.
The Ukrainian national revival began in the late 18th century with the emergence of modern Ukrainian literature, spearheaded by Ivan Kotliarevsky. Prominent 19th-century Ukrainian authors included Taras Shevchenko, Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky, and Lesya Ukrainka in the Russian Empire, and Ivan Franko in Austria-Hungary. The rise of a Ukrainian intelligentsia, increasingly composed of commoners and peasants, challenged the dominance of the traditional nobility and fueled the movement for national rights and social justice. However, fearing the rise of separatism, the Russian government imposed strict limits on Ukrainian language and culture. In 1863, the Valuev Circular banned the use of Ukrainian in religious and educational texts. Further repression came with the Ems Ukaz in 1876, which prohibited Ukrainian-language publications, the import of Ukrainian books from abroad, the use of Ukrainian in theater, and even public readings. Ukrainian schools were also suppressed. These policies prompted many Ukrainian intellectuals, such as Mykhailo Drahomanov and Mykhailo Hrushevsky, to flee to Austrian-ruled Western Ukraine. In addition, the development of underground educational organizations, such as the &quot;Prosvita&quot; society, played a critical role in preserving Ukrainian culture. Despite the restrictions, Ukrainians within the Russian Empire sometimes succeeded in advancing within the system, often blending loyalty to the tsar with a subtle promotion of their heritage.

The fate of Ukrainians under the Austrian Empire was markedly different. In Austrian-ruled Galicia, Ukrainians found themselves in a delicate position within the broader Russian-Austrian rivalry for influence in Central and Southern Europe. Unlike in the Russian Empire, Galicia’s ruling elite were primarily of Austrian or Polish descent, while the Ruthenian population remained predominantly peasant. During the 19th century, Russophilia was initially common among Galicia’s Slavic population. However, the influx of Ukrainian intellectuals fleeing Russian repression, combined with Austrian intervention, gradually replaced Russophilia with a growing Ukrainophilia. This sentiment spread back into Russian-ruled Ukraine, fueling the national revival.

The 2.4 million Ukrainians under Habsburg rule lived primarily in Eastern Galicia, with 95% of them being peasants. The region remained one of the poorest in Europe, with persistent land shortages and limited industrialization. Nevertheless, the Greek Catholic Church in Galicia became a key institution in preserving Ukrainian culture and fostering national identity. The first Ukrainian-language newspaper, &quot;Zoria Halytska&quot;, launched in 1848, symbolized the growing national awakening. Many Ukrainians from Galicia and other Austrian territories also emigrated to North America and South America during this period, seeking economic opportunities and escaping poverty.

The late 19th century witnessed a slow but steady growth of Ukrainian urban populations and the beginnings of a political awakening. Ukrainians in Galicia formed the Supreme Ruthenian Council and began advocating for autonomy and reforms, such as land redistribution. In Russian Ukraine, underground networks spread literature, education, and national ideas among the peasantry, contributing to the resilience of Ukrainian identity under challenging conditions.

=== War of Independence (1917–1922) ===


World War I and the wave of revolutions that swept across Europe—including the October Revolution in Russia—shattered empires such as the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires, leaving Ukraine caught in the midst of geopolitical upheaval. Between 1917 and 1919, several Ukrainian republics declared independence, marking the emergence of a complex array of states and territories seeking sovereignty. Among these were the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the Ukrainian State, the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the Makhnovshchina, the Kholodny Yar Republic, and the Kuban People&#x27;s Republic. Concurrently, a number of Bolshevik revolutionary committees, or revkoms, sought to establish Soviet power, leading to the formation of various Soviet-aligned entities, including the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of Soviets, the Odessa Soviet Republic, the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, the Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic, the Galician Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Each of these republics and regimes represented different visions for Ukraine&#x27;s future, reflecting the era&#x27;s ideological and territorial conflicts that would profoundly impact the region.

==== Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic ====

The Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR) was officially proclaimed on November 20, 1917, amidst the turmoil of the Russian Revolution and the disintegration of the Russian Empire. Initially, the Ukrainian Central Council (Rada), comprising influential Ukrainian political figures, pursued autonomy within a federated Russia. However, as the political situation in Russia grew increasingly unstable, the UPR took a decisive step by declaring full independence on January 22, 1918.

From its inception, the fledgling UPR faced significant challenges. Internally, political divisions among various factions, including socialists, nationalists, and federalists, complicated governance and decision-making. Economically, the nascent republic struggled with the transition from imperial control to an independent administration, resulting in shortages, inflation, and a weakened infrastructure. Externally, the UPR faced threats from multiple sides, primarily from the Bolsheviks, who regarded Ukraine as essential to their revolutionary agenda. As a result, they launched a series of military campaigns to assert control over Ukrainian territories, triggering prolonged and intense conflicts with UPR forces.

==== The first Bolshevik revolutionary committees ====

As the Bolsheviks sought to expand their influence across the former territories of the Russian Empire, Ukraine became a significant battleground. In December 1917, amidst the chaos of the Russian Revolution and the collapse of imperial power, the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of Soviets was proclaimed. This was a direct challenge to the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, which had declared its independence from the Russian Empire earlier that year. The UPR, led by nationalists and democrats, sought to build an independent Ukrainian state. In contrast, the Bolshevik-backed People&#x27;s Republic of Soviets aimed to bring Ukraine under Soviet control and align it with the goals of the Russian Bolsheviks.
In March 1918, this newly established republic merged with two other short-lived Soviet republics in the region: the Donetsk–Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic and the Odessa Soviet Republic. These republics were formed by local Bolshevik groups seeking to establish Soviet power across key industrial and strategic regions of Ukraine. The result of this merger was the Ukrainian Soviet Republic, a state that was aligned with Soviet Russia and part of the larger efforts of the Bolsheviks to secure control over Ukraine during the chaotic period of civil war and foreign intervention. This period was marked by fierce conflicts between various Ukrainian factions, including the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, anarchists, and foreign powers, alongside the advancing Bolshevik forces, contributing to the overall instability of the region. When the Bolshevik troops retreated from the territory, on April 18, 1918, the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was officially dissolved.

==== Ukrainian State ====
Amid growing unrest, a coup d&#x27;état led by General Pavlo Skoropadskyi on April 29, 1918, dismantled the UPR and established the Ukrainian State, also known as the Hetmanate. Skoropadskyi, a former officer in the Russian Imperial Army, assumed the title of Hetman of all Ukraine, aiming to create a strong, centralized state with close ties to the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. His vision for the Hetmanate included restoring order, promoting economic development, and implementing agrarian reforms to stabilize the economy and society.
While the Hetmanate initially brought some stability, Skoropadskyi&#x27;s alignment with the Central Powers and his authoritarian policies alienated many Ukrainians. Nationalists, socialists, and peasant groups grew increasingly discontented, perceiving his regime as prioritizing foreign interests over Ukrainian sovereignty. Additionally, Skoropadskyi&#x27;s agricultural reforms, which often favored large landowners and reinstated some pre-revolutionary land policies, furthered resentment among the rural populace.

As the Central Powers began to crumble in late 1918 with their defeat in World War I, opposition to Skoropadskyi&#x27;s rule surged. In November 1918, a coalition of anti-Hetmanate forces known as The Directorate, led by Symon Petliura, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, and other prominent Ukrainian leaders, initiated a successful uprising against Skoropadskyi’s government. By December 1918, Skoropadskyi was forced to abdicate, dissolving the Ukrainian State and restoring the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

==== West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic ====
Simultaneously, a separate Ukrainian state was established in the western part of the country. The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (WUPR) was proclaimed on October 19, 1918, following the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This new state centered around Eastern Galicia, including the key city of Lviv, Transcarpathia and extended into parts of Bukovina, areas with substantial Ukrainian populations. The WUPR government, led by Yevhen Petrushevych, aspired to build an independent Ukrainian state in Western Ukraine, distinct from both Polish and Russian influences.
The WUPR quickly developed its administrative structures, forming the Ukrainian Galician Army to defend its territories and introducing social and economic reforms to stabilize the new state. However, the WUPR’s claim over Eastern Galicia sparked immediate conflict with the re-established Polish state, which also sought control over the region. This territorial dispute erupted into the Polish-Ukrainian War (1918-1919), beginning with fierce fighting in Lviv, where Polish paramilitary forces resisted Ukrainian authority.

Although Ukrainian forces initially gained some ground, the Polish Army, bolstered by material support from the Entente Powers, soon regained momentum. By mid-1919, the Polish Army launched a major offensive, pushing back the Ukrainian Galician Army and regaining control over contested areas. Facing overwhelming opposition, WUPR forces retreated into Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR) territory by July 1919, marking the end of the WUPR as an independent state.

==== Unification Act ====

In an effort to consolidate their positions during a tumultuous period, UPR and WUPR formally united on January 22, 1919, through the signing of the Unification Act (Act Zluky). This historic declaration symbolized the unification of the two republics into a single Ukrainian state. Despite its significance as a milestone for Ukrainian national aspirations, the unification remained largely symbolic in practice. The lack of effective integration between the UPR and WUPR resulted in minimal military coordination or mutual support. Both entities were preoccupied with their respective military challenges: the UPR was engaged in a desperate struggle against advancing Bolshevik forces, while the WUPR was embroiled in a conflict with Polish troops over territorial claims in Eastern Galicia.

==== Other Ukrainian states and movements ====
The Makhnovshchina, which existed from 1918 to 1921, was a revolutionary anarchist movement in southern Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno. It emerged during the chaos of the Russian Civil War. The Makhnovists aimed to establish a stateless, self-managed society based on anarchist principles, where peasants and workers controlled the land and factories. Makhno&#x27;s forces fought against various powers, including the Bolsheviks, the White Army, and foreign invaders. Despite initial successes, the movement was eventually crushed by the Bolsheviks.
The Kholodny Yar Republic, which existed from 1919 to 1922, was a small Ukrainian insurgent state located in the Chyhyryn region. It was formed by local resistance fighters and peasants who opposed both the Bolshevik Red Army and White Army forces during the Russian Civil War. Inspired by Ukrainian independence and nationalist ideals, the republic remained independent for a few years but was eventually overwhelmed by Bolshevik forces.

In May 1919, in central Ukraine began the Hryhoriv Uprising, largest anti-soviet Uprising in Ukraine, which was brutally suppressed by regular troops.

The Kuban People&#x27;s Republic, which existed from 1918 to 1920, was a short-lived state established by Cossacks in the Kuban region, near the Black Sea. In the wake of the Russian Empire&#x27;s collapse during the revolution, the Kuban Cossacks declared independence and formed the Kuban Rada to govern. Their goal was to preserve their cultural identity and retain control over their land amid the Russian Civil War. The republic allied with the White Army against the Bolsheviks and sought to unite with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR) due to shared Cossack heritage and mutual strategic interests. However, these negotiations never culminated in a formal union, as the republic, isolated at the time, fell to the advancing Bolshevik Red Army in 1920, ending its brief independence.

==== Continued struggle and exile of the UPR government ====

After being driven out of Kyiv by Bolshevik forces in early 1919, the UPR government, led by Symon Petliura, continued to resist Bolshevik advances and Polish encroachment. By 1920, facing insurmountable odds and a deteriorating military position, Petliura sought an alliance with Poland. In April 1920, the Treaty of Warsaw was signed, under which the UPR agreed to recognize Polish control over Western Ukraine in exchange for Polish military support against the Bolsheviks.

The joint Polish-Ukrainian campaign initially achieved some success, including the temporary recapture of Kyiv in May 1920. However, the Bolshevik counter-offensive soon pushed back the allied forces. The situation for the UPR became even more precarious when Poland sought a peace agreement with Soviet Russia, culminating in the signing of the Treaty of Riga in March 1921. The treaty effectively partitioned Ukraine, leaving most of its territory under Soviet control and the western parts under Polish administration.

With the signing of the Treaty of Riga, the UPR government went into exile, primarily in Poland and other European countries. Ukrainian leaders continued their efforts to advocate for Ukrainian independence in the international arena, but without a territorial base or significant military forces, their influence was limited. Symon Petliura, a key figure in the UPR, continued his political activities in exile until his assassination in Paris in 1926.

Canadian scholar Orest Subtelny says:
: In 1919 total chaos engulfed Ukraine. Indeed, in the modern history of Europe no country experienced such complete anarchy, bitter civil strife, and total collapse of authority as did Ukraine at this time. Six different armies – those of the Ukrainians, the Bolsheviks, the Whites, the Entente [French], the Poles and the anarchists – operated on its territory. Kiev changed hands five times in less than a year. Cities and regions were cut off from each other by the numerous fronts. Communications with the outside world broke down almost completely. The starving cities emptied as people moved into the countryside in their search for food.

Historian Paul Kubicek says:
:Between 1917 and 1920, several entities that aspired to be independent Ukrainian states came into existence. This period, however, was extremely chaotic, characterized by revolution, international and civil war, and lack of strong central authority. Many factions competed for power in the area that is today&#x27;s Ukraine, and not all groups desired a separate Ukrainian state. Ultimately, Ukrainian independence was short-lived, as most Ukrainian lands were incorporated into the Soviet Union and the remainder, in western Ukraine, was divided among Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania.

==== Formation of the Ukrainian SSR ====

As both the UPR and WUPR faced defeat, the Bolshevik forces consolidated their control over Ukraine. On December 30, 1919, the Bolsheviks proclaimed the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (Ukrainian SSR), positioning it as a satellite of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). The new Soviet government aimed to establish complete Soviet authority over all Ukrainian territories, incorporating Ukraine into the broader framework of Soviet expansion.

The creation of the Ukrainian SSR marked the beginning of Soviet rule in Ukraine. Over the next two years, the Red Army systematically subdued remaining Ukrainian forces, nationalist resistance movements, and other anti-Bolshevik factions. By 1921, Bolshevik forces had largely crushed organized resistance, paving the way for the integration of the Ukrainian SSR as one of the founding republics of the Soviet Union in 1922.

=== Ukraine in Soviet Union (1922–1991) ===

==== Ukrainization and New Economic Policy ====

In the 1920s, the Soviet government implemented a policy of &quot;Ukrainization&quot; as part of its broader strategy to strengthen support for the Soviet regime in non-Russian republics. This policy encouraged the use of the Ukrainian language in education, government, and media. Ukrainian culture and history were promoted to win over the local population and intellectual elite. Ukrainization allowed a degree of cultural revival after years of Russian dominance in Ukraine. Ukrainian literature, theater, and arts experienced significant growth, and schools began teaching in the Ukrainian language. However, this policy was carefully controlled by the Communist Party, ensuring that cultural development aligned with Soviet ideology.

Following the devastation of war and revolution, the Soviet government introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP) to stabilize the economy. It represented a temporary retreat from pure socialist policies, allowing some elements of private enterprise and market mechanisms to function alongside state-controlled industries. The NEP had a mixed impact on Ukraine. On one hand, it allowed limited economic recovery, especially in agriculture and small-scale industry. Peasants were permitted to sell surplus products on the market, and small businesses could operate under certain conditions. On the other hand, large-scale industries remained under state control, and the heavy industrial sector, which Ukraine relied on, remained inefficient and slow to recover. While the NEP offered some relief to peasants, many remained suspicious of Soviet power, particularly after the harsh grain requisition policies during the civil war. Tensions between the peasantry and the Soviet regime continued to simmer.

During this period, the Communist Party tightened its control over Ukraine. The Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) became a key instrument in enforcing Soviet policies and maintaining order. Political power was highly centralized, with decisions made in Moscow dictating policy in Ukraine. Despite the relative cultural freedom of Ukrainization, any political opposition to the Soviet regime was harshly repressed. Former nationalists, intellectuals, and opponents of Soviet power were marginalized, and any movement toward true Ukrainian autonomy was quickly suppressed.
In the early Soviet years, there was a strong emphasis on rebuilding Ukraine&#x27;s war-ravaged economy. Ukraine was a critical industrial center, especially in coal, steel, and machinery production. While some infrastructure was rebuilt, economic challenges remained due to the inefficiency of state control and the lingering effects of war. Ukraine, being an agriculturally rich region, faced difficulties as the peasants were subjected to state control over grain production. Despite the NEP, rural areas continued to suffer from poverty, which would later fuel resistance to Soviet policies.

By the late 1920s, the NEP was being phased out as the Soviet Union prepared for a shift towards more centralized and state-controlled economic policies under Stalin. The focus was moving toward heavy industrialization and forced collectivization, setting the stage for the dramatic and tragic events of the 1930s, including the Holodomor. Although Ukrainization was relatively successful in the 1920s, by the end of the decade, Stalin&#x27;s regime began to reverse this policy, with a focus on Russian centralization. The coming years would see a crackdown on Ukrainian nationalism and culture as part of Stalin&#x27;s larger efforts to solidify control over the Soviet republics.

==== Forced collectivization, industrialization and Holodomor ====
In 1929, Joseph Stalin launched a campaign of forced collectivization across the Soviet Union, including Ukraine. The policy aimed to consolidate individual peasant farms into large, state-controlled collective farms (kolkhozes) to increase agricultural productivity and secure grain supplies for rapid industrialization. Ukrainian peasants, particularly wealthier ones known as &quot;kulaks&quot;, resisted collectivization. The Soviet regime responded with brutal force, seizing land, livestock, and grain, and deporting or executing those who resisted. Collectivization led to widespread chaos in rural areas. Agricultural output plummeted due to poor planning, lack of incentives, and resistance from the peasantry. The disruption of traditional farming practices and the state&#x27;s requisition of grain exacerbated food shortages.
In 1932-33, Holodomor, derived from the Ukrainian words for &quot;hunger&quot; () and &quot;extermination&quot; (), was a man-made famine that resulted from the Soviet government&#x27;s grain requisition policies and punitive measures against those who resisted collectivization. Millions of Ukrainians died from starvation during the Holodomor. Entire villages were decimated, and the event remains one of the most tragic episodes in Ukrainian history. The Soviet government denied the famine&#x27;s existence and continued exporting grain during the crisis. The Holodomor not only devastated the rural population but also weakened Ukrainian national identity and culture. It served as a stark warning against any resistance to Soviet authority.

Stalin&#x27;s economic strategy included a series of Five-Year Plans aimed at rapidly industrializing the Soviet Union. Ukraine, with its rich natural resources and strategic location, was a key focus of these plans. Ukraine became a major center for heavy industry, particularly in coal mining, steel production, and machine building. Cities like Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk (now Dnipro), and Stalino (now Donetsk) were transformed into industrial hubs. The rapid growth of industry led to significant urbanization. Millions of Ukrainians moved from rural areas to cities in search of work, fundamentally altering the demographic and social landscape.

==== Political repression and the Great Purge ====
Throughout the 1930s, Stalin&#x27;s regime became increasingly marked by paranoia and a relentless drive to eradicate any perceived threats to his authority. This climate of suspicion fueled widespread political repression across the Soviet Union, profoundly impacting every layer of society in Ukraine. The purges specifically targeted Ukrainian intellectuals, artists, political leaders, and ordinary citizens suspected of harboring nationalist sympathies or potential dissenting views. Stalin’s objective was clear: to eliminate any possible source of opposition to Soviet rule, no matter how tenuous or imagined.
The Great Purge, reaching its zenith between 1936 and 1938, devastated Ukraine. During this period, tens of thousands were arrested, tortured, and executed, or sent to forced labor camps (the Gulag) in remote Soviet regions. The Ukrainian intelligentsia, initially supported during the Soviet policy of Ukrainization in the 1920s, became a particular target as they were increasingly viewed as a threat to Soviet ideological conformity. In a systematic crackdown, the NKVD, Stalin’s secret police, dismantled the Ukrainian cultural and intellectual community. Most members of this intelligentsia were either imprisoned, executed, or driven to despair and suicide. One notable site, the Slovo Building in Kharkiv, where many prominent Ukrainian intellectuals resided, became infamous as a place where residents were closely surveilled, then rounded up in these purges.

The terror also took a horrific toll on Kyiv, which became the capital of the Ukrainian SSR in 1934, replacing Kharkiv. Tens of thousands of Kyiv’s citizens were abducted by Soviet security forces, tortured, and summarily executed on fabricated charges. Victims were accused of treason, espionage, or nationalist activities without evidence and sentenced to death in sham trials. Their bodies were secretly buried in Bykivnia, a wooded area near Kyiv, which later became one of the largest mass grave sites in Ukraine. After Ukraine’s independence and the declassification of KGB archives, thousands of graves were discovered in Bykivnia, leading to the establishment of the Bykivnia Graves Memorial Complex. Soviet authorities had long denied the truth, claiming instead that Nazi atrocities had caused the mass burials.

These purges were marked by infamous show trials, where prominent figures were coerced, often through brutal interrogation, into confessing to invented charges of anti-Soviet activity. The loss of Ukraine&#x27;s educated and skilled citizens stifled intellectual, cultural, and social progress for decades, creating a legacy of fear that has hampered Ukraine&#x27;s development and left a scar that is remembered in Ukraine to this day.

==== World War II and the Nazi Occupation ====

In October 1938, following the Munich Agreement, Carpatho-Ukraine, also known as Subcarpathian Ruthenia, gained autonomy within Czechoslovakia. This allowed the formation of a local government led by Avhustyn Voloshyn. However, this period of autonomy was brief.

In March 1939, as Czechoslovakia disintegrated under pressure from Nazi Germany, Carpathian Ukraine declared independence as the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine. The government envisioned this small, mountainous region as the nucleus of a future independent Ukrainian state. Unfortunately, this independence was short-lived. Within days, Hungarian forces, supported by Nazi Germany, invaded and occupied the region. The occupation was brutal, and many Ukrainian leaders were arrested or executed. Carpathian Ukraine remained under Hungarian control.

On 1 September 1939, World War II began with Nazi Germany’s invasion of western Poland. Sixteen days later, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The eastern part of Poland, which included Western Ukraine (Galicia and Volhynia), was annexed into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. As Soviet forces occupied these territories, they quickly implemented Sovietization policies, repressing nationalist movements and religious institutions, which fueled local resentment.

On 22 June 1941, Nazi Germany and its allies launched Operation Barbarossa, invading the Soviet Union. Ukraine became one of the main battlegrounds during the conflict, as Nazi forces occupied large parts of the country, including major cities such as Kyiv, Odesa, and Lviv. The German occupation, while initially seen by some as a potential liberation from the oppressive Soviet regime, quickly turned brutal. Nazi ideology viewed Ukraine as a critical part of its plan for Lebensraum (living space) and exploitation of resources.
Around 4.5 to 6 million Ukrainians fought in the Soviet Red Army against Nazi Germany, contributing significantly to the eventual Soviet victory. At the same time, Ukraine became a center of partisan resistance. Some Ukrainians collaborated with the Germans, hoping to secure independence, while others joined the resistance movement. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), formed by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), fought for an independent Ukraine, engaging in conflict with both the Nazis and the Soviet forces. This dual struggle was motivated by a desire to free Ukraine from foreign domination, but the complexity of alliances and enmities made this a multi-sided war.

Meanwhile, some factions within the Ukrainian nationalist movement, such as the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDA), sought autonomy within a pro-Polish framework before the war. However, Polish policies of forced assimilation marginalized these efforts, leading to growing tensions between Poles and Ukrainians. During the German occupation, these tensions escalated into violent ethnic conflicts in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, known as the Volhynian-Galician tragedy. The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and Polish underground forces, including the Armia Krajowa, engaged in a simultaneous campaign of mutual violence during 1943–1944. The UPA targeted Polish civilians in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, resulting in the deaths of up to 100,000 Poles, while Polish forces carried out attacks on Ukrainian civilians, killing tens of thousands of Ukrainians. These events, driven by competing nationalist ambitions, caused immense suffering on both sides and remain a deeply painful chapter in Ukrainian-Polish history.

The Nazi occupation of Ukraine was marked by extreme brutality, especially towards Jews. Around 1.5 million Jews were murdered during the Holocaust in Ukraine, with atrocities such as the Babi Yar massacre, where tens of thousands of Jews were executed near Kyiv. The occupation also saw widespread repression of other groups, including Roma, communists, and Ukrainian nationalists.

By 1943, following the Battle of Stalingrad, the tide of the war began to turn in favor of the Soviet Union. Soviet forces began to push the Germans out of Ukraine, and by 1944, the entire country was back under Soviet control. However, Soviet &quot;liberation&quot; did not bring freedom for many Ukrainians. The Soviet government imposed harsh reprisals against those suspected of collaboration with the Nazis or support for Ukrainian independence. The NKVD (Soviet secret police) conducted mass arrests, deportations, and executions. Small groups of UPA partisans continued their armed resistance against the Soviet regime well into the late 1940s and early 1950s, particularly in Western Ukraine, though the Soviet authorities eventually crushed this insurgency.
Carpathian Ukraine, during the Hungarian occupation, faced significant repression, particularly against its Jewish and Ukrainian populations. Thousands of Jews from the region were deported to Nazi concentration camps, and many Ukrainian nationalists were imprisoned or killed. In 1944, the Soviet Red Army &quot;liberated&quot; Carpathian Ukraine from Hungarian and German forces.

In addition to the annexation of Galicia and Volhynia, several other territories were incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and subsequent wartime events. These included Northern Bukovina, Carpathian Ukraine (Transcarpathia), and parts of Northern and South Bessarabia, regions with a predominantly Ukrainian population.

==== Post-war Ukrainian SSR, limited reforms and continuation of repressions ====
After World War II, amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR were accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of international law in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of the founding members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR. This was part of a deal with the United States to ensure a degree of balance in the General Assembly, which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. In its capacity as a member of the UN, the Ukrainian SSR was an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 1948–1949 and 1984–1985.
However, this period was also marked by severe repression and social upheaval. The famine of 1946-1947 devastated large parts of Ukraine, as the Soviet government requisitioned the entirety of the grain harvest, exacerbating food shortages. Western Ukraine, however, was less affected by the famine, largely due to the resistance efforts of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA). In response, the Soviet regime launched Operation &quot;West&quot; in 1947, forcibly deporting over 77,000 individuals—men, women, and children—from Western Ukraine to Siberia. These deportees later played a critical role in organizing uprisings within the Soviet Gulag system, including the notable Norilsk Uprising, which hastened the decline of the forced labor camp network.

After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 and the rise of Nikita Khrushchev to power, a significant number of political prisoners were released from the Gulag, including many Ukrainian nationalists and intellectuals. However, those deemed a threat to Soviet authority often remained under close surveillance. While some victims of Stalinist purges were formally rehabilitated, this process was selective and incomplete, with many individuals still excluded from full reintegration into society.
Khrushchev, focusing on agricultural development, emphasized the importance of Ukraine’s fertile soil in Soviet food production. This was particularly significant in the context of the Virgin Lands Campaign, which saw resources and personnel diverted to develop agricultural lands in Kazakhstan and Siberia. While the campaign had long-term effects on the Ukrainian agricultural sector, Ukrainian collective farms remained inefficient, plagued by bureaucratic mismanagement that hampered the potential benefits of these reforms. During this period, industrial growth continued, with particular emphasis on heavy industries like steel production and mining. However, outdated infrastructure and poor planning often undermined progress, and economic inefficiency persisted throughout the country.

The Khrushchev Thaw, a period of relative cultural liberalization, also allowed for a limited expression of Ukrainian identity, especially through literature, the arts, and historical studies. Prominent Ukrainian writers such as Oles Honchar and Lina Kostenko emerged, reflecting themes of national identity and social change. Their work offered subtle resistance to Soviet ideologies, though they had to navigate a highly censored environment. Industrialization also sparked rapid urbanization, with many Ukrainians moving to cities for factory and mining jobs. This period saw a rise in literacy rates and access to education, contributing to the development of a more technically skilled population. However, the curricula remained ideologically driven, prioritizing loyalty to the Communist Party over independent thought or national identity.
In 1954, the Crimean Peninsula was transferred from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) to the Ukrainian SSR. The transfer was largely administrative, as both the RSFSR and the Ukrainian SSR were part of the Soviet Union, and it was part of Khrushchev&#x27;s broader strategy, rather than a gesture of genuine autonomy for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian nationalists, including remnants of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), continued to face persecution. While the UPA’s armed resistance had been largely crushed by the early 1950s, nationalist sentiments remained a clandestine force, particularly among intellectuals and rural populations. Those who strayed too far from Soviet ideology faced censorship, harassment, and sometimes imprisonment. Despite the brief cultural revival and improvements in living standards, the era was marked by continued economic inefficiency and political repression. The limited freedoms allowed under Khrushchev&#x27;s rule fostered a new generation of Ukrainian intellectuals who began to explore national identity in ways that would later fuel the dissident movement. However, despite these small steps toward cultural and intellectual freedom, Ukraine remained firmly under Soviet control, with little political autonomy or room for genuine national development.

The transfer of power from Nikita Khrushchev to Leonid Brezhnev in 1964 was a result of a coup orchestrated by the Communist Party leadership. Khrushchev&#x27;s policies, such as de-Stalinization and economic reforms, had created dissatisfaction among party elites due to their perceived instability and inefficiency. In October 1964, during a Politburo meeting, Khrushchev was accused of policy failures and forced to resign. Leonid Brezhnev, who had gained the trust of party conservatives, replaced Khrushchev as General Secretary. Brezhnev’s leadership marked a return to collective decision-making, stability, and more conservative policies, emphasizing continuity and avoiding the bold reforms associated with Khrushchev.
Under Brezhnev, often associated with the &quot;stagnation&quot; period, Ukraine faced significant challenges. Centralized control from Moscow left Ukrainian Communist Party leaders, such as Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, as mere executors of Kremlin policies. Russification policies intensified, sidelining the Ukrainian language and culture in favor of Soviet Russian dominance. Ukrainian literature, art, and history were heavily censored, with works reflecting national identity banned or rewritten. Political repression was severe. The KGB targeted dissidents, intellectuals, and cultural figures advocating for Ukrainian autonomy or identity. Figures like Vasyl Stus, Ivan Dziuba, and Viacheslav Chornovil faced harassment, imprisonment, or exile. Despite repression, underground movements persisted, using samizdat to circulate banned works and raise awareness of Soviet human rights violations.

Economically, Ukraine remained an industrial powerhouse, producing steel, coal, and machinery, and serving as the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;breadbasket&quot;. However, inefficient planning, outdated infrastructure, and environmental degradation plagued the economy. Poor agricultural yields and bureaucratic mismanagement led to food shortages. Urbanization grew, but housing shortages and inadequate services highlighted the stagnation. Environmental issues worsened, particularly in industrial regions like Donbas, where pollution severely impacted public health. Rural areas were neglected, fueling urban migration. Despite Ukraine’s contributions to the Soviet space program and industrial output, minimal modernization occurred.
The suppression of Ukrainian identity and the struggles of dissidents sowed seeds of resistance. Activists like Vasyl Stus and the Ukrainian Helsinki Group exposed Soviet human rights abuses, though they faced harsh punishments. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Ukraine became a focal point for dissident activity within the USSR. A disproportionately high number of Ukrainian intellectuals, activists, and cultural figures were imprisoned, exiled, or subjected to punitive psychiatry for opposing the regime. These movements not only highlighted systemic oppression in the Soviet Union, but also laid the foundation for a national awakening that ultimately fueled Ukraine&#x27;s quest for independence.

After the death of Leonid Brezhnev in 1982, the Soviet Union experienced a period of short-lived leadership under Yuri Andropov (1982–1984) and Konstantin Chernenko (1984–1985), before Mikhail Gorbachev assumed power in 1985. Gorbachev&#x27;s introduction of &quot;glasnost&quot; (openness) and &quot;perestroika&quot; (restructuring) marked a turning point, fostering an atmosphere of reform and amplifying public dissatisfaction with Soviet governance. Glasnost opened the door for greater freedom of expression, allowing Ukrainian intellectuals, activists, and dissidents to publicly address long-suppressed issues such as Russification, environmental degradation, and historical atrocities like the Holodomor. During this time, organizations like the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, and movements like Rukh (the People’s Movement of Ukraine, established in 1989) emerged as key advocates for greater autonomy, cultural revival, and ultimately, independence. As a major industrial and agricultural hub within the USSR, Ukraine bore the brunt of the broader Soviet economic stagnation. Inefficient central planning, a lack of innovation, and overexploitation of resources resulted in widespread economic inefficiencies and severe environmental damage.
On 26 April 1986, the Ukrainian town of Pripyat became the site of one of the worst nuclear disasters in history when Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded. This released a significant amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere, which was carried across Europe by wind currents. The resulting radioactive fallout contaminated vast areas of northern Ukraine and neighboring Belarus. The immediate aftermath of the explosion was devastating. Two plant workers died on the night of the accident, and in the weeks that followed, 28 emergency workers succumbed to acute radiation sickness. The disaster forced the evacuation of over 100,000 people from Pripyat and surrounding areas, leaving behind ghost towns and a contaminated Chernobyl exclusion zone that remains uninhabitable to this day. This tragedy had profound environmental, health, and political consequences. The Chernobyl disaster galvanized local independence movements, such as Rukh, which gained significant momentum in the late 1980s and contributed to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union.

The late 1980s witnessed a cultural awakening in Ukraine, characterized by a renewed interest in the Ukrainian language, traditions, and history. Efforts to revive Ukrainian cultural identity challenged decades of Soviet policies aimed at suppressing it. The reestablishment of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and movements advocating for an independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church underscored growing dissatisfaction with Soviet atheism and fueled nationalist sentiment. These developments signaled a rising tide of Ukrainian self-awareness and a determination to reclaim national identity and sovereignty.

==== The Path to Independence ====

By 1990, calls for Ukrainian sovereignty reached a fever pitch, fueled by decades of cultural suppression, economic exploitation, and a growing national consciousness among Ukrainians. On 21 January 1990, one of the most iconic demonstrations of unity and determination occurred when over 300,000 Ukrainians formed the &quot;human chain&quot; stretching from Kyiv to Lviv. This symbolic act, known as the &quot;Chain of Unity&quot;, marked the anniversary of the Unification Act of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in 1919. It highlighted the nation&#x27;s steadfast commitment to reclaiming its independence, emphasizing the unity between eastern and western Ukraine.

In March 1991, a referendum on preserving the Soviet Union was held, and in Ukraine, the majority of voters approved the new Union Treaty, supporting the idea of joining the Soviet Union based on Ukraine&#x27;s Declaration of State Sovereignty. Voters were specifically asked, &quot;Do you agree that Ukraine should be part of a Union of Soviet sovereign states on the basis of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine?&quot; The proposal was approved by 81.7% of voters.

However, a few months later, events occurred that radically changed the situation. In August 1991, the so-called August Coup took place in Moscow, an attempt by conservative communists to seize power and regain tight control within the USSR. The coup failed, but it seriously undermined trust in the central government in the USSR, provoking a wave of declarations of independence among the republics.

==== Post-Soviet transition: building the foundations of independence ====


On August 24, 1991, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian Parliament) declared Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union, a decisive step taken in the wake of the failed August Coup. This historic decision was reinforced by a nationwide referendum on December 1, 1991, where 90.32% of voters supported independence, with majorities in every region (including 54.19% in Crimea). That same day, Ukraine held its first presidential election, a pivotal moment in its post-Soviet history. Leonid Kravchuk, a former high-ranking Soviet official, won the election, becoming first President of Ukraine. During his tenure, Kravchuk worked to maintain stability, distance Ukraine from Moscow’s influence, and manage internal political challenges.

The dissolution of the USSR was formalized in the Białowieża Forest in Belarus, where the leaders of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—Leonid Kravchuk, Stanislav Shushkevich, and Boris Yeltsin—signed the Belovezha Accords on 8 December 1991. These accords declared the Soviet Union defunct and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) as a loose association of former Soviet republics. By 26 December 1991, the USSR officially ceased to exist, and Ukraine&#x27;s independence gained de jure recognition from the international community.

After declaring independence, Ukraine began a complex post-Soviet transition, shaping its identity as a new independent nation. From 1991 to 1996, Ukraine experienced significant political, economic, and social transformations aimed at establishing itself as a sovereign state on the global stage.

In the early years of independence, the Verkhovna Rada played a key role in establishing the country’s legal and political framework. As Ukraine’s legislative body, the Rada was responsible for drafting and passing laws to build the foundation of Ukraine’s political and economic structures. However, it faced ideological divides as members debated Ukraine’s path—whether to orient toward Western integration or maintain stronger ties with Russian Federation. These debates mirrored broader societal divides and significantly influenced legislative reform.
To solidify its national identity, Ukraine adopted state symbols that resonated with historical and cultural significance. The Parliament selected the blue-and-yellow flag and the tryzub (trident) as national emblems, which became powerful representations of Ukrainian sovereignty and unity.

A significant historical moment of this period was the transfer of powers from the President of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in exile, Mykola Plaviuk, to the newly elected President of independent Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, during the solemn session of the Verkhovna Rada on August 22, 1992 in Kyiv. This transfer, while largely symbolic, marked a continuity of the Ukrainian struggle for independence, linking the efforts of past leaders to those of the new government. This act represented the culmination of over 70 years of Ukrainian national aspirations and signaled a deepening commitment to the state’s sovereignty and historical continuity. In his declaration, Plaviuk proclaimed that the current Ukrainian state is the lawful successor to the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and a continuation of its authority and state traditions.

The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, signed on December 5, 1994, by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, was a critical agreement in post-Soviet geopolitics. It formalized the process by which Ukraine surrendered the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, inherited after the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse, which included approximately 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads. Although these weapons were stationed on Ukrainian territory, they were operationally controlled by Moscow, and Ukraine’s possession of such an arsenal posed significant concerns for global non-proliferation efforts. In return for surrendering the weapons, the signatory powers provided assurances of Ukraine&#x27;s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence. The memorandum guaranteed that no force or threats of force would be used against Ukraine, and no economic or political pressure would be employed to undermine its status. It also affirmed that the United Nations Security Council would intervene in case of aggression against Ukraine. However, the assurances were political commitments, not legally binding guarantees, which made their enforcement dependent on the goodwill of the signatories.

The transition to a market economy was compounded by inflation and political instability. The absence of immediate reforms led to widespread frustration, culminating in a snap presidential election in 1994, where Leonid Kravchuk was succeeded by Leonid Kuchma, an engineer and former Soviet official. Kuchma’s presidency aimed at modernizing Ukraine’s economy and fostering a balanced relationship with both Russia and Western Europe, a delicate approach to preserving Ukraine’s independence amid complex geopolitical pressures.
Trying to stabilize the economy, back in 1992, Ukraine introduced a temporary currency, the Ukrainian karbovanets. This currency was intended to serve as a stopgap measure until a more permanent solution could be implemented. The karbovanets quickly devalued, contributing to growing economic instability. In 1996, Ukraine introduced the Hryvnia as the national currency, marking a significant milestone in the country’s economic transition and further solidifying its independence. It is named after a measure of weight used in Kievan Rus&#x27;.

Despite disputes in the Verkhovna Rada, which at the time struggled to reach consensus on reform initiatives and reconcile the interests of pro-Western and pro-Russian factions, Ukraine took a decisive step in defining its legal structure by adopting the Constitution of Ukraine on June 28, 1996. This document established Ukraine as a democratic, law-based state with a presidential-parliamentary system, clearly delineating the separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Drafted with input from various political factions and scholars, the Constitution enshrined Ukraine’s commitment to legal governance and human rights, becoming a cornerstone for Ukraine’s development as an independent nation.

At the end of its transition, Ukraine created the main components of its independence. With its own currency, Constitution, national symbols, and a growing sense of national identity, Ukraine began to chart its course as a sovereign state. Despite the fact that the post-Soviet transition period caused numerous economic and political challenges, this formative period played an important role in shaping the direction and identity of modern Ukraine.

==== Strengthening and growing contradictions ====

The third presidential election in Ukraine took place in 1999, resulting in a victory for Leonid Kuchma, who defeated Petro Symonenko in the run-off. This secured Kuchma a second consecutive term. However, his second term was plagued by widespread controversies, including allegations of authoritarianism, pervasive corruption scandals, curtailment of media freedoms, and large-scale public protests that challenged his leadership and legitimacy.
One of the darkest episodes of Kuchma’s presidency was the &quot;Cassette Scandal&quot;, which erupted after recordings allegedly made by his former bodyguard, Mykola Melnychenko, were leaked. These recordings implicated Kuchma in severe abuses of power, including involvement in the murder of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, as well as corruption and electoral manipulations. The scandal provoked massive public outrage, culminating in the &quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot; protests of 2000–2001. These protests, marked by their intensity and broad support, severely undermined Kuchma&#x27;s standing both domestically and internationally.

During his presidency, Kuchma’s administration was accused of suppressing opposition media outlets and harassing journalists and political opponents. High-profile figures like Viacheslav Chornovil died under mysterious circumstances, further fueling suspicions of state complicity. Historian Serhy Yekelchyk observed that Kuchma&#x27;s government &quot;employed electoral fraud freely&quot;, particularly during the 1999 presidential elections and the 2000 constitutional referendum.

Amid these challenges, Viktor Yushchenko, a respected economist and reformer, rose to prominence. His tenure as the Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine earned him recognition for his professionalism and integrity, which led to his appointment as Prime Minister in 1999, during Kuchma&#x27;s re-election campaign. Yushchenko was perceived as a technocratic leader capable of addressing Ukraine’s economic stagnation and corruption.
Initially, Yushchenko&#x27;s government embarked on an ambitious reform agenda. These reforms included fiscal discipline, restructuring of key industries, and efforts to stabilize the economy, which had suffered during Kuchma’s first term. However, Yushchenko&#x27;s policies soon clashed with the entrenched oligarchic networks that had flourished under Kuchma&#x27;s protection. These oligarchic factions, wielding significant influence in Parliament and the Kuchma administration, actively resisted reforms that threatened their monopolistic practices and access to state resources.

One of the most contentious episodes of Yushchenko’s premiership was the dismissal of his deputy prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, in 2001. Tymoshenko, who spearheaded anti-corruption initiatives and energy sector reforms, posed a significant challenge to oligarchic interests. Under pressure from Kuchma and oligarchic allies, Yushchenko was forced to dismiss Tymoshenko, a move that symbolized the constraints on reform under Kuchma’s presidency. Shortly after, the Verkhovna Rada, dominated by pro-Kuchma factions, passed a vote of no confidence in Yushchenko’s government, effectively ending his tenure as Prime Minister. Kuchma’s lack of support during this political crisis highlighted the deepening rift between the two leaders.

Following his dismissal, Yushchenko became a potent symbol of reform and anti-corruption, gaining significant public support. In 2002, he founded the &quot;Our Ukraine&quot; (&quot;Nasha Ukrayina&quot;) political coalition, which championed pro-Western and democratic ideals. This bloc emerged as a key opposition force against Kuchma’s policies and set the stage for the pivotal 2004 presidential election. In this election, Yushchenko, as the leading opposition candidate, challenged Viktor Yanukovych, Kuchma’s chosen successor, in a contest that would shape Ukraine’s political trajectory for years to come.

==== Orange Revolution and post-revolution challenges====

In 2004, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma announced he would not seek re-election after serving two terms in office. This decision created a political vacuum that set the stage for a highly contested 2004 presidential election between two main candidates. Viktor Yanukovych, the incumbent Prime Minister, was supported by Kuchma and the Russian Federation. He advocated closer ties with Russia. On the other hand, Viktor Yushchenko, the opposition leader, campaigned as a reformist, emphasizing democratic changes and closer integration with the European Union.
The campaign highlighted deep regional and cultural divisions within Ukraine. The western and central regions of the country rallied behind Yushchenko, while the eastern and southern regions strongly supported Yanukovych. A prominent figure in Yushchenko&#x27;s coalition was Yulia Tymoshenko, a charismatic and polarizing politician. Known for her iconic braided hairstyle and fiery rhetoric, Tymoshenko played a pivotal role in galvanizing support for the opposition. Her speeches and leadership became symbols of the movement for change.

The second round of the presidential election, held on November 21, 2004, officially declared Viktor Yanukovych as the winner. However, widespread allegations of electoral fraud, including ballot-stuffing, voter intimidation, and falsification of results, led to a political crisis. The situation was further intensified by the attempted poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko with dioxin during the campaign, which left him severely disfigured. This attack garnered widespread sympathy for Yushchenko and galvanized his supporters.

The announcement of Yanukovych’s victory sparked massive protests, marking the beginning of the Orange Revolution, a landmark event in Ukraine’s modern history. From November 22, 2004, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians gathered at Kyiv’s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), demanding justice, democracy, and fair elections. The protesters adopted the color orange, symbolizing Yushchenko’s campaign and the broader ideals of hope and resistance to corruption and authoritarianism.
Yulia Tymoshenko emerged as a central figure in the revolution, inspiring crowds with her impassioned speeches and coordinating efforts to sustain the movement. The protests remained largely peaceful, with participants emphasizing nonviolence and civil disobedience, despite provocations aimed at inciting unrest. On December 3, 2004, Ukraine’s Supreme Court invalidated the election results due to evidence of fraud and ordered a re-run of the runoff. This repeat election, held on December 26, 2004, resulted in Viktor Yushchenko&#x27;s victory with 52% of the vote. Yanukovych resigned as Prime Minister, and his cabinet was dismissed on January 5, 2005. Yushchenko&#x27;s inauguration as president marked the culmination of the Orange Revolution.

In February 2005, Yulia Tymoshenko was appointed Prime Minister, cementing her role as a key political figure in post-revolution Ukraine. However, the Orange coalition faced internal struggles during Yushchenko’s presidency. Relations between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko began to deteriorate, weakening the government’s ability to implement reforms. In September 2005, Yushchenko dismissed Tymoshenko from her position as Prime Minister, creating a rift that would have lasting effects on Ukrainian politics.

Under Yushchenko, Ukraine’s foreign policy shifted toward strengthening ties with the European Union, often at the expense of its relationship with Russia. This realignment caused tensions, particularly over energy issues. In 2005, a dispute over natural gas prices with Russia resulted in shortages across Europe, as Ukraine served as a critical transit country for gas supplies. A compromise was reached in January 2006, but the incident underscored the fragility of Ukraine&#x27;s relations with its eastern neighbor.
The 2006 parliamentary elections in Ukraine reflected a deeply fragmented political landscape. The elections were marked by the re-emergence of Viktor Yanukovych, a rival of President Viktor Yushchenko and a proponent of closer ties with Russia. Yanukovych’s Party of Regions secured significant support, enabling him to become Prime Minister. This marked a shift in Ukraine’s political orientation, with Yanukovych advocating for a more pro-Russian agenda in contrast to Yushchenko’s pro-European stance. The elections exacerbated tensions between the presidency and parliament, as the balance of power between the two branches of government became a central issue. Frequent political deadlocks ensued, paralyzing governance and delaying key reforms. The strained relationship between Yushchenko and Yanukovych led to a standoff, which ultimately resulted in snap elections in 2007. The snap elections led to the formation of a coalition opposed to Yanukovych’s agenda. Yulia Tymoshenko returned as Prime Minister, yet the political environment remained fraught with instability. Conflicts between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko, which had begun earlier, persisted, further weakening the government and contributing to widespread public frustration.

Tensions reached a breaking point in September 2008, triggering a major political crisis. The crisis began when Yushchenko’s Our Ukraine–People’s Self-Defense Bloc (NU-NS) withdrew from the governing coalition after the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) sided with the opposition Party of Regions in supporting a bill on 4 September 2008 that sought to curtail the president’s powers in favor of the prime minister and parliament. Yushchenko saw this as a direct challenge to his authority, accusing Tymoshenko of betraying the coalition’s principles and aligning with pro-Russian forces. On 16 September 2008, the official collapse of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was announced. As attempts to restore the alliance failed, this led to a deepening political stalemate.
The crisis finally ended on 9 December 2008, when the Orange Coalition was reformed, now including Lytvyn Bloc. This followed the election of Volodymyr Lytvyn as parliamentary speaker on 8 December, securing his faction’s support for a new governing majority. Shortly after, on 16 December 2008, a new government was formed, representing a 245-seat parliamentary majority composed of the Lytvyn Bloc, the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko, and Our Ukraine–People&#x27;s Self-Defense Bloc. Though this coalition temporarily stabilized the political landscape, deep divisions among Ukraine’s leadership persisted, continuing to undermine governance and public confidence.

Ukraine was severely impacted by the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The crisis led to a sharp economic downturn, with GDP contracting significantly as demand for Ukraine’s key exports, such as steel, plummeted. The government faced a budgetary crisis and had to rely on a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stabilize the economy. The IMF package came with stringent conditions, including fiscal austerity measures and structural reforms, which sparked domestic controversy. Adding to Ukraine’s economic woes was an escalating energy dispute with Russia. Ukraine, as a major transit country for Russian natural gas to Europe, found itself at the center of geopolitical tensions. Disagreements over gas pricing and transit fees between Ukraine’s Naftogaz and Russia’s Gazprom reached a boiling point in 2009.
The 2009 gas conflict was a major standoff that highlighted Ukraine’s vulnerability and its dependence on Russian energy. The dispute centered on allegations of unpaid bills and demands by Russia for higher gas prices. In January 2009, Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine, plunging several European countries into an energy crisis during the winter. Negotiations eventually resulted in a new agreement, but the episode underscored the fragility of Ukraine’s energy security. The crisis damaged Ukraine’s reputation as a reliable transit country and strained its relations with both Russia and the European Union. It also placed significant financial pressure on the government, further destabilizing the economy.

Throughout this period, the rivalry between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko continued to destabilize Ukrainian politics. Their clashes over policy, governance, and political priorities created a climate of dysfunction. Tymoshenko accused Yushchenko of obstructing her efforts to address economic and social issues, while Yushchenko criticized her populist policies as reckless and counterproductive. These internal conflicts not only hindered progress but also deepened public disillusionment with the political elite.

==== Period of political turbulence ====

By the time of Ukraine&#x27;s 2010 presidential election, the alliance between Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko, key figures of the Orange Revolution, had disintegrated. Tymoshenko competed against both Yushchenko and Viktor Yanukovych in a tightly contested three-way race. With Yushchenko’s approval rating drastically weakened, many pro-Orange voters abstained, leading to a runoff between Tymoshenko and Yanukovych. In the final round, Yanukovych secured the presidency with 48% of the vote, while Tymoshenko received 45%.

Upon taking office, Yanukovych and his Party of Regions swiftly moved to consolidate power. In March 2010, the newly formed parliamentary majority, the &quot;Coalition of Stability and Reforms&quot;, dismissed Tymoshenko as Prime Minister, replacing her with Yanukovych’s longtime ally, Mykola Azarov. His administration pursued closer ties with Russia, notably signing the controversial Kharkiv Pact, which extended Russia’s Black Sea Fleet lease in Sevastopol until 2042 in exchange for discounted gas prices. The deal sparked protests from pro-European and nationalist groups, who saw it as a threat to Ukraine’s sovereignty.
In the 2012 parliamentary elections, the Party of Regions further strengthened its grip on power, securing the largest number of seats despite widespread allegations of vote-rigging, administrative pressure, and misuse of state resources. The opposition remained fragmented, though it made notable gains. The newly formed UDAR party, led by heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, positioned itself as a pro-European force, while the nationalist Svoboda party, previously on the political margins, unexpectedly surpassed the electoral threshold, capitalizing on growing dissatisfaction with Yanukovych’s rule.

The largest opposition bloc, Batkivshchyna, led by Arseniy Yatsenyuk in Tymoshenko’s absence, struggled to counterbalance the ruling party’s dominance. By this time, Tymoshenko had been imprisoned since 2011 on charges of abuse of office, a case widely condemned by Western governments and human rights organizations as politically motivated. Her imprisonment, along with the selective prosecution of other opposition figures, was cited as a key reason for the European Union&#x27;s reluctance to deepen ties with Ukraine under Yanukovych’s leadership.

==== Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity ====

In November 2013, President Yanukovych did not sign the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement and instead pursued closer ties with Russia. This move sparked protests on the streets of Kyiv and, ultimately, the Revolution of Dignity. Protesters set up camps in Kyiv&#x27;s Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), and in December 2013 and January 2014 protesters started taking over various government buildings, first in Kyiv, and later in Western Ukraine. Battles between protesters and police resulted in about 80 deaths in February 2014.

Following the violence, the Ukrainian parliament on 22 February voted to remove Yanukovych from power (on the grounds that his whereabouts were unknown and he thus could not fulfil his duties), and to free Yulia Tymoshenko from prison. On the same day, Yanukovych supporter Volodymyr Rybak resigned as speaker of the Parliament, and was replaced by Tymoshenko loyalist Oleksandr Turchynov, who was subsequently installed as interim President. Yanukovych had fled Kyiv, and subsequently gave a press conference in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War and Western integration ====
In March 2014, the Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation occurred. Although official results of a referendum on Crimean reunification with Russia were reported as showing a large majority in favor of the proposition, the vote was organized under Russian military occupation and was denounced by the European Union and the United States as illegal.
The Crimean crisis was followed by pro-Russian unrest in east Ukraine and south Ukraine. In April 2014 Ukrainian separatists self-proclaimed the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic and held referendums on 11 May 2014; the separatists claimed nearly 90% voted in favor of independence. Later in April 2014, fighting between the Ukrainian army and pro-Ukrainian volunteer battalions on one side, and forces supporting the Donetsk and Lugansk People&#x27;s Republics on the other side, escalated into the war in Donbas. By December 2014, more than 6,400 people had died in this conflict, and according to United Nations figures it led to over half a million people becoming internally displaced within Ukraine and two hundred thousand refugees to flee to (mostly) Russia and other neighboring countries. During the same period, political (including adoption of the law on lustration and the law on decommunization) and economic reforms started. On 25 May 2014, Petro Poroshenko was elected president in the first round of the presidential election. By the second half of 2015, independent observers noted that reforms in Ukraine had considerably slowed down, corruption did not subside, and the economy of Ukraine was still in a deep crisis. By December 2015, more than 9,100 people had died (largely civilians) in the war in Donbas, according to United Nations figures.

The Budapest Memorandum&#x27;s fragility became evident in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea and began supporting separatist movements in Ukraine&#x27;s Donetsk and Luhansk regions. These actions violated the agreement’s commitments to respect Ukraine&#x27;s borders and sovereignty. Russia justified its actions by claiming they were protecting Russian-speaking populations, a rationale widely rejected by the international community. Despite protests from Ukraine and Western powers, no direct action was taken to compel Russia to adhere to the memorandum. The crisis exposed the limitations of non-binding agreements, leaving Ukraine in a precarious position and reshaping the global conversation about security assurances and the reliability of international commitments.

On 1 January 2016, Ukraine joined the DCFTA with the EU. Ukrainian citizens were granted visa-free travel to the Schengen Area for up to 90 days during any 180-day period on 11 June 2017, and the Association Agreement formally came into effect on 1 September 2017. Significant achievements in the foreign policy arena include support for anti-Russian sanctions, obtaining a visa-free regime with the countries of the European Union, and better recognition of the need to overcome extremely difficult tasks within the country. However, the old local authorities did not want any changes; they were cleansed of anti-Maidan activists (lustration), but only in part. The fight against corruption was launched, but was limited to sentences of petty officials and electronic declarations, and the newly established NABU and NACP were marked by scandals in their work. Judicial reform was combined with the appointment of old, compromised judges. The investigation of crimes against Maidan residents was delayed. In order to counteract the massive global Russian anti-Ukrainian propaganda of the &quot;information war&quot;, the Ministry of Information Policy was created, which for 5 years did not show effective work, except for the ban on Kaspersky Lab, Dr.Web, 1С, Mail.ru, Yandex and Russian social networks VKontakte or Odnoklassniki and propaganda media. In 2017, the president signed the law &quot;On Education&quot;, which met with opposition from national minorities, and quarreled with the Government of Hungary..

On 19 May 2018, Poroshenko signed a Decree which put into effect the decision of the National Security and Defense Council on the final termination of Ukraine&#x27;s participation in the statutory bodies of the Commonwealth of Independent States. As of February 2019, Ukraine minimized its participation in the Commonwealth of Independent States to a critical minimum and effectively completed its withdrawal. The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine did not ratify the accession, i.e. Ukraine has never been a member of the CIS.

The Kerch Strait incident occurred on 25 November 2018 when the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels attempting to pass from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol.
On 6 January 2019, in Fener, a delegation of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine with the participation of President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko received a Tomos on autocephaly. The Tomos was presented to the head of the OCU, Metropolitan Epiphanius, during a joint liturgy with the Ecumenical Patriarch. The next day, Tomos was brought to Ukraine for a demonstration at St. Sophia Cathedral. On 9 January, all members of the Synod of the Constantinople Orthodox Church signed the Tomos during the scheduled meeting of the Synod.

On 21 February 2019, the Constitution of Ukraine was amended, with the norms on the strategic course of Ukraine for membership in the European Union and NATO being enshrined in the preamble of the Basic Law, three articles and transitional provisions.

On 21 April 2019, Volodymyr Zelenskyy was elected president in the second round of the presidential election. Early parliamentary elections on 21 July allowed the newly formed pro-presidential Servant of the People party to win an absolute majority of seats for the first time in the history of independent Ukraine (248). Dmytro Razumkov, the party&#x27;s chairman, was elected speaker of parliament. The majority was able to form a government on 29 August on its own, without forming coalitions, and approved Oleksii Honcharuk as prime minister. On 4 March 2020, due to a 1.5% drop in GDP (instead of a 4.5% increase at the time of the election), the Verkhovna Rada fired Honcharuk&#x27;s government and Denys Shmyhal became the new Prime Minister.

On 28 July 2020, in Lublin, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine created the Lublin Triangle initiative, which aims to create further cooperation between the three historical countries of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and further Ukraine&#x27;s integration and accession to the EU and NATO.

On 2 February 2021, a presidential decree banned the television broadcasting of the pro-Russian TV channels 112 Ukraine, NewsOne and ZIK. The decision of the National Security and Defense Council and the Presidential Decree of 19 February 2021 imposed sanctions on 8 individuals and 19 legal entities, including Putin&#x27;s pro-Russian politician and Putin&#x27;s godfather Viktor Medvedchuk and his wife Oksana Marchenko.

On 17 May 2021, the Association Trio was formed by signing a joint memorandum between the Foreign Ministers of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Association Trio is tripartite format for the enhanced cooperation, coordination, and dialogue between the three countries (that have signed the Association Agreement with the EU) with the European Union on issues of common interest related to European integration, enhancing cooperation within the framework of the Eastern Partnership, and committing to the prospect of joining the European Union.

At the June 2021 Brussels Summit, NATO leaders reiterated the decision taken at the 2008 Bucharest Summit that Ukraine would become a member of the Alliance with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) as an integral part of the process and Ukraine&#x27;s right to determine its own future and foreign policy without outside interference.
Throughout 2021, Russian forces built up along the Russia-Ukraine Border, in occupied Crimea and Donbas, and in Belarus. On 24 February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. Russia quickly occupied much of the east and south of the country, but failed to advance past the city of Mykolaiv towards Odesa, and were forced to retreat from the north after failing to occupy Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv. After failing to gain further territories and being driven out of Kharkiv Oblast by a fast-paced Ukrainian counteroffensive, Russia officially annexed the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic, along with most of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts on 30 September. The invasion was met with international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March 2022. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states all declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, along with mass arrests of anti-war protesters in Russia, which also enacted a law enabling greater media censorship. Over 1,000 companies closed their operations in Russia and Belarus as a result of the invasion.

On the eve of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the country was the poorest in Europe, a handicap whose cause was attributed to high corruption levels and the slow pace of economic liberalization and institutional reform. Russia&#x27;s invasion of the country damaged Ukraine&#x27;s economy and future prospects of improvement to such an extent, that the GDP of the country was projected to shrink by as much as 35% in its first year alone after the invasion.

Ukraine was originally preparing to formally apply for EU membership in 2024, but instead signed an application for membership in February 2022.

==National historiography==
Knowledge about Ukraine in other parts of the world came chiefly from Russian secondary sources until relatively recently. After the second half of the seventeenth century, when Muscovy and later the Russian Empire came to control much of Ukrainian territory, Russian writers included Ukraine as part of Russian history. This included referring to medieval Kievan Rus&#x27; as &quot;Kievan Russia&quot; and its Old East Slavic culture and inhabitants as &quot;Kievan Russian&quot; or &quot;Old Russian&quot;. Later Ukraine or its parts were called &quot;Little Russia&quot;, &quot;South Russia&quot;, &quot;West Russia&quot; (with Belarus), or &quot;New Russia&quot; (the Black Sea coast and southeastern steppe). But parts of Ukraine beyond Russia&#x27;s reach were called Ruthenia and its people Ruthenians. The names chosen to refer to Ukraine and Ukrainians have often reflected a certain political position, and sometimes even to deny the existence of Ukrainian nationality. The Russian point-of-view of Ukrainian history became the prevailing one in Western academia, and although the bias was identified as early as the 1950s, many scholars of Slavic studies and history believe significant changes are still necessary to correct the Moscow-centric view.

The scholarly study of Ukraine&#x27;s history emerged from romantic impulses in the late 19th century when German Romanticism spread to Eastern Europe. The outstanding leaders were Volodymyr Antonovych (1834–1908), based in Kiev, and his student Mykhailo Hrushevsky (1866–1934). The first serious challenge to the Russian view of Ukraine was Hrushevsky&#x27;s 1904 article &quot;The Traditional Scheme of &#x27;Russian&#x27; History and the Problem of the Rational organization of the History of the Eastern Slavs&quot;. For the first time full-scale scholarly studies based on archival sources, modern research techniques, and modern historical theories became possible. However, the demands of government officials—Tsarist, to a lesser degree Austro-Hungarian and Polish, and later Soviet—made it difficult to disseminate ideas that ran counter to the central government. Therefore, exile schools of historians emerged in central Europe and Canada after 1920.

Strikingly different interpretations of the medieval state of Kievan Rus&#x27; appear in the four schools of historiography within Ukraine: Russophile, Sovietophile, Eastern Slavic, and Ukrainophile. In the Soviet Union, there was a radical break after 1921, led by Mikhail Pokrovsky. Until 1934, history was generally not regarded as chauvinistic, but was rewritten in the style of Marxist historiography. National &quot;pasts&quot; were rewritten as social and national liberation for non-Russians, and social liberation for Russians, in a process that ended in 1917. Under Stalin, the state and its official historiography were given a distinct Russian character and a certain Russocentrism. Imperial history was rewritten such that non-Russian love caused an emulation and deference to &quot;join&quot; the Russian people by becoming part of the (tsarist) Russian state, and in return, Russian state interests were driven by altruism and concern for neighboring people. Russophile and Sovietophile schools have become marginalized in independent Ukraine, with the Ukrainophile school being dominant in the early 21st century. The Ukrainophile school promotes an identity that is mutually exclusive of Russia. It has come to dominate the nation&#x27;s educational system, security forces, and national symbols and monuments, although it has been dismissed as nationalist by Western historians. The East Slavic school, an eclectic compromise between Ukrainophiles and Russophilism, has a weaker ideological and symbolic base, although it is preferred by Ukraine&#x27;s centrist former elites.

Many historians in recent years have sought alternatives to national histories, and Ukrainian history invited approaches that looked beyond a national paradigm. Multiethnic history recognises the numerous peoples in Ukraine; transnational history portrays Ukraine as a border zone for various empires; and area studies categorises Ukraine as part of East-Central Europe or, less often, as part of Eurasia. Serhii Plokhy argues that looking beyond the country&#x27;s national history has made possible a richer understanding of Ukraine, its people, and the surrounding regions. since 2015, there has been renewed interest in integrating a &quot;territorial-civic&quot; and &quot;linguistic-ethnic&quot; history of Ukraine. For example, the history of the Crimean Tatars and the more distant history of the Crimea peninsula is now integrated into Ukrainian school history. This is part of the constitutionally mandated &quot;people of Ukraine&quot; rather than &quot;Ukrainian people&quot;. Slowly, the histories of Poles and Jews are also being reintegrated. However, due to the current political climate caused by territorial sovereignty breaches by Russia, the role of Russians as &quot;co-host&quot; has been greatly minimized, and there are still unresolved difficult issues of the past, for example, the role of Ukrainians during the Holodomor.

After 1991, historical memory was a powerful tool in the political mobilization and legitimation of the post-Soviet Ukrainian state, as well as the division of selectively used memory along the lines of the political division of Ukrainian society. Ukraine did not experience the restorationist paradigm typical of some other post-Soviet nations, for example the three Baltic countries—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia—although the multifaceted history of independence, the Orthodox Church in Ukraine, Soviet-era repressions, mass famine, and World War II collaboration were used to provide a different constitutive frame for developing Ukrainian nationhood. The politics of identity (which includes the production of history textbooks and the authorization of commemorative practices) has remained fragmented and tailored to reflect the ideological anxieties and concerns of individual regions of Ukraine.

===Canadian historiography on Ukraine===
In Soviet Ukraine, twentieth-century historians were strictly limited in the range of models and topics they could cover, with Moscow insisting on an official Marxist approach. However, émigré Ukrainians in Canada developed an independent scholarship that ignored Marxism, and shared the Western tendencies in historiography. George W. Simpson and Orest Subtelny were leaders promoting Ukrainian studies in Canadian academe. The lack of independence in Ukraine meant that traditional historiographical emphases on diplomacy and politics were handicapped. The flourishing of social history after 1960 opened many new approaches for researchers in Canada; Subtelny used the modernization model. Later historiographical trends were quickly adapted to the Ukrainian evidence, with special focus on Ukrainian nationalism. The new cultural history, post-colonial studies, and the &quot;linguistic turn&quot; augmenting, if not replacing social history, allowed for multiple angles of approach. By 1991, historians in Canada had freely explored a wide range of approaches regarding the emergence of a national identity. After independence, a high priority in Canada was assisting in the freeing of Ukrainian scholarship from Soviet-Marxist orthodoxy—which downplayed Ukrainian nationalism and insisted that true Ukrainians were always trying to reunite with Russia. Independence from Moscow meant freedom from an orthodoxy that was never well suited to Ukrainian developments. Scholars in Ukraine welcomed the &quot;national paradigm&quot; that Canadian historians had helped develop. Since 1991, the study of Ukrainian nation-building became an increasingly global and collaborative enterprise, with scholars from Ukraine studying and working in Canada, and with conferences on related topics attracting scholars from around the world.

<doc id="84798" wikidata="Q260770" url="?curid=84798" title="Annabel Chong">
<text>Grace Quek (), known professionally as Annabel Chong, is a Singaporean former pornographic actress who became famous after starring in an adult film that was promoted as the &quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Gang Bang&quot;. The film was commercially successful and started a trend of &quot;record-breaking&quot; gang bang pornography. Four years later, Quek was the subject of the documentary &quot;&quot;, in which she was interviewed about her pornography career. She retired from the adult industry completely in 2003 to work in software engineering.

==Biography==
Quek was born and raised in Singapore in a middle-class Protestant Singaporean Chinese family. She was the only child of two teachers. She was a student at Raffles Girls&#x27; School, where she was enlisted in the country&#x27;s Gifted Education Programme and Hwa Chong Junior College. Former teachers and classmates describe Quek as quiet, conservative, intelligent, and studious.

After taking her A-levels, she took three gap-years, including a year spent in the United States, before going on to study law at King&#x27;s College London on a scholarship. 

While in England, Quek was riding on a train and met a man she became attracted to, and agreed to have sex with him in an alleyway. He brought along other men, and she was gang raped and robbed in a rubbish closet under an inner-city housing block.

At the age of 21, she dropped out of law school and went on to study photography, art and gender studies at the University of Southern California (USC), where she excelled academically. At the same time, she also began working in pornographic films. She later went on to do graduate studies in gender studies at USC.

==Pornography career==
Since her parents did not approve of her dropping out of law school, she needed a source of income to pay her college fees. In 1994, she started in porn by answering an advertisement for a modelling agency in &quot;LA Weekly&quot;. Quek was reportedly interested in blurring the boundary between pornography and performance art in her work.

==&quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Gang Bang&quot;==
The production that propelled her into the limelight was another Bone production, &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Gang Bang&quot;. Quek took part in this gang bang on January 19, 1995, when she was 22 years old. She said part of her motivation to do the film was a desire to challenge gender roles. She appeared in advertisements on adult television to solicit 300 participants for the event. Initial reports differed as to whether she had sex with 251 men over the course of 10 hours, or with around 70 men multiple times to reach a total of 251: the largest number ever in a pornographic film. Acting on the understanding that male participants who had verified a recent negative test for HIV would wear a colour-coded tag, Quek had sex with some men without a condom. It later emerged that the testing had not been as strictly verified as the producers had led her to believe. Even though the film became one of the highest-grossing pornographic films of all time, she was never paid the US$10,000 she was promised, and she apparently never received any money from the video.

==Appearances in popular culture==
After the event Quek made a host of media appearances, including &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; and &quot;The Girlie Show&quot;. Loretta Chen viewed Quek&#x27;s work in pornography as an attempt to challenge the settled notions and assumptions of viewers about female sexuality and gender boundaries, but was not taken seriously enough. For example, her conception of a gang bang was based on the example of Messalina, a wife of the emperor Claudius. Historically Messalina suffered from a poor reputation, a fact that some attributed (at least partly) to gender bias. According to Quek, she sought to question the double standard that denies women the ability to exhibit the same sexuality as men, by modelling what a female &quot;stud&quot; would be.

In her March 2000 appearance on the radio program &quot;Loveline&quot;, Quek admitted that there were slightly fewer than 70 men in her gang bang and that there were water and lunch breaks during the ten-hour shoot. For her performance, she earned a &quot;dubious achievement award&quot; in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine.

The event also prompted author Chuck Palahniuk to write a novel, &quot;Snuff&quot;, about a fictional character who aimed to surpass Quek&#x27;s record by having sex with 600 men. In 2007 a play written by Ng Yi Sheng based on her story, &quot;251&quot;, was staged in Singapore, directed by Loretta Chen.

==&quot;Sex: The Annabel Chong Story&quot;==
Quek&#x27;s media appearances caught the interest of Canadian film student Gough Lewis. He met Quek and set out to produce a documentary about her. While filming, Quek and Lewis became involved in a romantic relationship. The film, &quot;Sex: The Annabel Chong Story,&quot; was released in 1999. It includes footage from the gang bang shooting and her subsequent publicity appearances, explores her motives, revisits with her the site of her rape and depicts a painful conversation in Singapore between Quek and her mother, who had not known about her daughter&#x27;s porn career before then. It was directed by Lewis and featured contributions from Quek, Al Goldstein, Ron Jeremy and Seymore Butts. In the film, Quek stated that she intended the &quot;World&#x27;s Biggest Gang Bang&quot; to challenge &quot;the notion of women as passive sex objects,&quot; and added, &quot;We&#x27;re not wilting violets, we&#x27;re not victims, for Christ&#x27;s sake. Female sexuality is as aggressive as male sexuality. I wanted to take on the role of the stud. The more [partners], the better.&quot; She also self-harmed in the film, taking a knife to her arm on the day Lewis and Quek broke up. What the documentary didn&#x27;t show was that Lewis was doing the same to himself off-camera.

The documentary propelled her further into the world media as it became a hit at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, where it was nominated for a Grand Jury Prize. Since the release of the documentary, Quek has accused Lewis of misconstruing events in the film and portraying events in &quot;misleading&quot; way.

==Late pornography career and retirement==
Quek continued to work in the adult industry for a short while after the documentary came out, directing and starring in films as well as setting up a website. In 2000 she directed and performed in the gang bang film &quot;Pornomancer&quot;, her take on William Gibson&#x27;s novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;. After 2000 she largely stopped appearing in mainstream adult videos, concentrating instead on producing content for her website and appearing in a few BDSM videos. In 2003 she completely retired from porn, thanking her fans in a final message on her website that announced, &quot;Annabel is dead and is now replaced full time by her Evil Doppelgänger, who is incredibly bored with the entire concept of Annabel and would prefer to do something different for a change.&quot; She stated that she intended to &quot;begin her new life of peace and relative obscurity.&quot; She stopped discussing her former career in the adult industry after her retirement. In limited correspondence for the biographical play &quot;251,&quot; she told the producers, &quot;Do whatever you want with Annabel Chong because this person doesn&#x27;t exist anymore.&quot; In 2011 &quot;Complex&quot; magazine ranked her at #41 in their list of &quot;The Top 50 Hottest Asian Porn Stars of All Time&quot;.

In 2000, while working in a strip club, she role-played as a student learning how to write computer code, while her client would spank her whenever she made a mistake. After the role-play, she was inspired to learn how to write computer code. In 2001, she attained an associate degree in software engineering at Westwood College. After graduating, she worked as a freelance consultant until becoming a full-time engineer after retiring from porn. she works as a web developer in California.

<text>Bellver Castle (, ) is a Gothic-style castle on a hill 3 km to the west of the center of Palma on the Island of Majorca, Balearic Islands, Spain. It was built in the 14th century for King James II of Majorca, and is one of the few circular castles in Europe. First serving as the residence of the Kings of Majorca, and afterward long used as a military prison throughout the 18th to mid-20th century, it is now under civilian control, being one of the main tourist attractions of the island, as well as the seat for the city&#x27;s History Museum.

== Origins and evolution ==

The castle&#x27;s plan, a circular floor with round towers attached to it somewhat like the Herodion, a 15 BCE hilltop palace in the West Bank, that was also circular and had a large principal tower and three minor towers as well. They are attached while the principal one is coupled to the complex by a high bridge over the surrounding moat. 

The Castle has clear Islamic influences in its original design, displaying double Arches characteristic of Moorish architecture, a part of the fortification was built by architect Pere Salvà, who also worked in the construction of the Royal Palace of La Almudaina, together with other master masons between 1300 and 1311 for King James II of Aragon and Majorca. Rock from the hill where the castle sits was used for the building, which has eventually led to the appearance of cracks.
Once the castle had been built, and following the introduction of artillery, the battlements on the top balconies and the barbican disappeared, being soon followed by those in every tower; loopholes were built instead. 

== History ==

The castle originally served as a residence for the Kings of Mallorca after the conquest of Majorca from the Almohad Caliphate Taifa of Majorca, whenever they were not staying in mainland Europe, and was subsequently seldom used as a residence for viceroys during the 17th century. As a fortification, it suffered and successfully resisted two sieges during the Middle Ages; the first of them in 1343, during Peter IV of Aragon&#x27;s campaign to reincorporate the Majorcan territories to the Crown of Aragon, and then again in 1391 during an anti-semitic peasant revolt. The castle has only fallen once in its history into enemy hands, in 1521 after an assault during the Majorcan second Revolt of the Brotherhoods.

The castle was usually governed by a Lord Warden. In 1408, King Martin I of Aragon gave the lordship of Bellver to the Charterhouse of Jesus of Nazareth in Valldemossa. Charles of Viana arrived in 1459 to take possession of both the island and the castle, as he had agreed with his father King John II of Aragon, even though finally the King did not grant the lordship or Bellver Castle.

Being an enclosed site, since the end of the 14th century it was used as a prison, firstly to hold Queen Violante of Vilaragut, her stepchildren James and Isabella and other supporters of King James III of Mallorca after his death in the Battle of Llucmajor in 1349. During the War of Spanish Succession it was used to imprison first supporters of Philip of Anjou, and after the Bourbon victory, Maulets (supporters of the Habsburg pretender). During the Spanish Independence War it was used to hold several prisoners captured at the Battle of Bailén and later, political prisoners, the most famous of these being the minister Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos (1802–1808) who first made a description of the castle and commissioned the first blueprints and drawings of it. The castle served from then on as a political prison, used to lock up several important supporters of the subsequent Habsburg pretenders to the Spanish throne during the 19th century, and later notable republican and Catalanist leaders during the 20th century, including Alexandre Jaume, Member of the Parliament who first won the castle for the city, and Emili Darder, who was the mayor of the city, both subsequently shot.


== Features ==
Having been founded as a seat for the royal court of James of Mallorca, its structure combines the needs of a palace with defensive elements. The most notable feature in its structure is its circular shape, unique in Mallorca. Both its surrounding wall and the inner yard are so-shaped, and so are the three minor towers and the donjon. A moat is found surrounding the castle and its donjon.

The circular inner yard must be highlighted. It has a well in the middle of it, which indicates there is a cistern underneath. The palace itself is structured as a two-story building around the central yard. All its dependencies face this yard through a gallery of gothic semi-circular arches.

== Current uses ==
In 1931, the Spanish Second Republic gave the castle to the city of Palma, along with the forest surrounding it. It became a museum in 1932, being restored in 1976 to become the city&#x27;s History museum. Thanks to the parking lot and road built next to the castle, it currently welcomes a great number of visitors. The main yard is the seat to many different public ceremonies, such as protocol and cultural acts, and concerts. Due to its location and visibility from the sea or any other point of the city, it has become one of the city&#x27;s symbols.

The surrounding forest encloses the stables of the city&#x27;s Mounted Peelers. There is also a chapel dedicated to Saint Alphonsus Rodriguez, built between 1879 and 1885.

The Sunday following Easter Sunday, the citizens gather at the forest and the castle for the celebration of the &quot;Diumenge de l&#x27;Àngel&quot;.

<doc id="84801" wikidata="Q13491" url="?curid=84801" title="Palamós">
<text>Palamós () is a town and municipality in the Mediterranean Costa Brava, located in the &quot;comarca&quot; of Baix Empordà, in the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. Palamós is located at the northern end of a large bay. The town is by-passed by the C31 which connects the coastal towns of the central Costa Brava with Girona. Palafrugell lies to the north and Castell-Platja d&#x27;Aro to the south. 

Palamós is a staging point on the GR 92 long distance footpath, which runs the length of the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Stage 8, to the north, follows the cliffs to the beach at La Fosca before taking an inland route to Calella de Palafrugell and then following the coast again through Llafranc, Tamariu and Fornells de Mar to the next staging point at Begur, a distance of . Stage 9, to the south, follows the beachfront promenade to Sant Antoni de Calonge and then the coast through Platja d&#x27;Aro and S&#x27;Agaró to the next staging point at Sant Feliu de Guíxols, a distance of .

==History==
The first evidence of human settlement in the Palamós area is the , on the top of Montagut hill between Palamós and Vall-llobrega. Dating from the 3rd or 2nd millennium BC, this has 3 slabs in their original state and the remains of a tomb that these once covered.

Evidence exists of an early settlement lies around north-east of the town, on a rocky promontory at the north end of Platja de Castell beach. The Castell de la Fosca is a stone settlement of the Iberian Indigetes people which seems to have been inhabited from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.

Further south than the Castell de la Fosca, but still north of the current town and port, is the Castell de Sant Esteve de Mar. Archaeological evidence suggests that this site was occupied from the Roman period, and that the site was fortified in the twelfth century AD. By the thirteenth century, Peter II of Barcelona (also known as Peter III of Aragon) was looking to found a new port on the coast as the previous royal port in the region at Torroella de Montgrí on the River Ter had silted up. In 1277, he bought the castle and its estate, which included the site of the current port, with that in mind. As a consequence of the purchase, Palamos was founded and recognised as a village on 3 December 1279.

The site of the current port was used during the Roman period and before, but it was then disused until it was rebuilt after Peter&#x27;s purchase of 1277. In 1285, the Battle of Les Formigues was fought near the Formigues Islands, just offshore from Palamós, resulting in a victory for the Catalan fleet over the French.

Palamós was the birthplace of Frederic Pujulà i Vallès (1877–1962), a journalist and dramatist who was a pioneer of Esperanto literature.

Palamós was served by the gauge Palamós–Girona–Banyoles railway, which reached a junction with the Barcelona–Cerbère railway at Flaçà by 1887 and was extended to Girona by 1921. Service on the line continued until 1956.

==Economy==
The town is a major port (with the closure of Sant Feliu de Guíxols the only commercial harbour in the Province of Girona) with one of the last remaining fishing fleets on this part of the Mediterranean coast. It is famous for the locally caught prawns from Palamós ().

The town&#x27;s major economic activities until the second half of the 20th century were fishing and cork manufacturing. In the sixties, however, the town saw a rapid growth of tourism. The architecture of Palamos itself remained relatively unchanged with most development focused to the south at Sant Antoni de Calonge which now merges with Palamos. The bay between the two is popular for sailing, swimming and windsurfing. The town&#x27;s nightlife is focused on the old port which is surrounded by bars and restaurants.

==Sport==
The town is home to Palamós CF the local football club. The oldest club in Catalonia. They share their ground, the Estadi Palamós Costa Brava with the small, but over-achieving club UE Llagostera, as the club&#x27;s stadium, Estadi Municipal de Llagostera, didn&#x27;t meet the LFP criteria.

<text>Roses (; , ) is a municipality in the &quot;comarca&quot; of the Alt Empordà, located on the Costa Brava, Catalonia, Spain. 

Roses is the site of the former bishopric of Rotdon, now a Latin Catholic titular see. It is situated on the coast at the northern end of the Gulf of Roses, and is an important fishing port and tourist centre. The C-260 road links the town with Figueres.

The GR 92 long distance footpath, which roughly follows the length of the Mediterranean coast of Spain, has a staging point at Roses. Stage 3 links northwards to Cadaqués, a distance of , whilst stage 4 links southwards to the El Cortalet pond in the Parc Natural dels Aiguamolls de l&#x27;Empordà, a distance of .

==History==
===Early history===

The origins of Roses are disputed. According to classical sources, it was founded in the 8th century BC by Greek colonists from Rhodes and was called Rhode () and Rhodus (Ῥόδος) and Ῥοδίπολις/Ῥόδη πόλις.

It seems more probable that it was founded in the 5th century BC by Greeks from Massalia (Marseilles), perhaps with an admixture of colonists from neighbouring Emporion (today&#x27;s Empúries). Remains of the Greek settlement can still be seen.

Remains from the Roman period go back to the 2nd century BC and continue well into Christian times with a paleochristian church and necropolis. After the collapse of Roman power the town seems to have been abandoned, but a fortified settlement from the Visigothic period has been excavated on the nearby Puig Rom.

The mediaeval town grew around the monastery of Santa Maria de Roses (mentioned since 944). Its jurisdiction was shared by the abbots of Santa Maria de Roses and the counts of Empúries. In 1402 the county of Empúries was incorporated into the Crown of Aragon and Roses acquired the right to organize its own municipal government and economy.

=== Fortification ===

In the first decades of the 16th century, Roses suffered repeated attacks by privateers from North Africa. To counter the threat, Charles V ordered the construction of extensive fortifications, the Ciutadella, in 1543. In spite of the precautions, a naval squadron led by the Turkish admiral Barbarossa attacked and plundered the town some months later. After substantial revisions, the fortifications were completed in 1553, under Charles&#x27;s son Philip II. The entire medieval town was enclosed by a bastioned pentagonal wall (&quot;illustration, below&quot;).

The defensive system was supplemented by the Castell de la Trinitat, some 2.5 km to the east. The town received a permanent military garrison, which profoundly changed its character. To minimise friction between the citizenry and the soldiers, barracks were constructed, but did not prevent the gradual movement of part of the population to outside the walls, where the modern town of Roses now is.

In the following centuries, the fortifications were severely tested. In 1645, during the Catalan Revolt, French troops besieged Roses and captured it. The Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659) restored the town to Spain.

In 1693, during the War of the Grand Alliance the French captured the town again. This time the French occupation lasted until the Peace of Ryswick in 1697. In 1712, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Austrian troops tried to take the city, but were driven off. In 1719, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, the French again attacked, but failed to take Roses.

After a long period of relative calm, the Wars of the French Revolution ushered in a new round of hostilities. In 1793, the French revolutionary government declared war on Spain. At first, the Spanish armies won a foothold in France, but in 1794 the revolutionary armies invaded Catalonia. The Siege of Roses lasted from 28 November 1794 until 3 February 1795, when the garrison was safely evacuated by a Spanish naval squadron, except for 300 soldiers. The town was surrendered to France, but the war between France and Spain ended at the Peace of Basle signed in July 1795. The city quickly returned to Spanish control.

In 1808, Emperor Napoleon I of France forced King Charles IV of Spain and his son Ferdinand to abdicate and installed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte on the throne. When the Spanish people revolted against this high-handed behavior, French armies again invaded the country in the Peninsular War. The fourth and last Siege of Roses occurred in 1808. During the operation, the Scottish Royal Navy captain, Thomas Cochrane assisted the Spanish by putting his men into Castell de la Trinitat to help defend the town. The Scot stayed until the citadel and the town surrendered, before evacuating himself and his men. In 1814, when the defeated French withdrew from Spain, they blew up the town&#x27;s fortifications along with the Castell de la Trinitat. At this time, the ancient town, called the &quot;Ciutadella&quot;, was completely ruined. Meanwhile, to the east the modern town slowly continued to grow.

===Contemporary age===

In 1879, Roses suffered a devastating economic crisis through phylloxera, a pest of the grapevines, that destroyed the town&#x27;s wine growing industry. Some of the population moved to Barcelona or emigrated to the United States.

In the 20th century, notably in the period after World War II, Roses profited from the growth of tourism.

Over the last decades, important excavations have been carried out inside the walls of the Ciutadella concerning not only the Greek and Roman remains, but part of the medieval city and its walls. In the 1990s, extensive restoration work was carried out on the walls of the Ciutadella, and in 2004 a museum was opened inside it. A controversial restoration of the Castell de Trinitat was formally completed in 2010.

Roses was the home of El Bulli, one of the world&#x27;s best and most famous restaurants, from 1961 until its closure in July 2011. El Bulli had held three Michelin stars since 1997 and was rated the world&#x27;s best restaurant for four straight years 2006-2009 by &quot;Restaurant Magazine&quot;.

==Ecclesiastical history==
The monastery of Santa Maria de Roses is mentioned in a document of the year 944. Around the monastery grew the mediaeval town of Roses, whose jurisdiction was shared by the abbots of Santa Maria de Roses and the counts of Empúries.

As Rotdon, it was a suffragan bishopric of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona, but faded.

===Titular see===
The diocese was nominally restored in 1969 as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric. The title has been held by:
* William Tibertus McCarty, C.SS.R. (1969.09.11 – 1971.01.13)

* Jesús Fernández González (2013.12.10 – 2020.06.08)
* Aurelio García Macías (2021.05.27 – present)

== Demographics ==
According to Idescat, Roses&#x27; population in 2016 was 19,438 people on a land area of 45.9 km, the density is 423.4 people per square kilometer, much higher than the average of the Comarca of Alt Empordà (103.2) and the overall of Catalonia (234.3).

* Population groups by Age (2015)

* Population groups by gender (2016)
Roses increases its population in summer because of tourism and welcomes 120,000 visitors, the majority of them from Spain, France, Germany and Great Britain.

<text>Apeldoorn (; Dutch Low Saxon: ) is a municipality and city in the province of Gelderland in the centre of the Netherlands. The municipality of Apeldoorn, including the of villages of Beekbergen, Loenen, Ugchelen and Hoenderloo, had a population of 165,525 on 1 December 2021. The western half of the municipality lies on the Veluwe ridge, with the eastern half in the IJssel valley.

== The city of Apeldoorn ==


The oldest known reference to Apeldoorn, then called Appoldro, dates from the 8th century. The settlement came into being at the point where the old road from Amersfoort to Deventer crossed that from Arnhem to Zwolle. A 1740 map refers to it as A&quot;pp&quot;eldoorn.

Close by is the favourite country-seat of the royal family of the Netherlands called the palace het Nieuwe Loo (now Het Loo). It was originally a hunting lodge of the dukes of Gelderland, but in its present form dates chiefly from the time of the then Stadtholder William III of England (1685–1686).
The younger sister of Princess Beatrix, Princess Margriet, lives nearby the palace Het Loo, with her husband Pieter van Vollenhoven.

Apeldoorn was a relatively insignificant place until the major building projects of the 19th century and those of the period following World War II. The Protestant church was restored after a fire in 1890. The Roman Catholic Mariakerk is a national monument.

Apeldoorn possesses large paper-mills, many offices (Centraal Beheer, an insurance company; the Dutch Tax services; the &quot;Kadaster&quot;, the government land registry service; and some more), a hospital and nursing homes. With over 100,000 people working in the municipality, Apeldoorn is one of the most important employment centres in the eastern Netherlands. Apeldoorn also has several important educational institutes, such as the Saxion University of Applied Sciences (hotel and facility management), the Wittenborg University of Applied Sciences, the Netherlands Police Academy and the Theological University of Apeldoorn.

Apeldoorn is well suited to logistical and distribution companies because of its location close to the intersection of two major Dutch motorways. The A1 runs west from Amsterdam to the German border, where it leads towards Hannover, and Berlin. The A50 connects the north of the Netherlands with the south. 

Apeldoorn used to be well known as a town of paper making and clothes washing companies, due to the clean filtered groundwater which seeped through the sand of push moraines down to the IJsselvallei east of Apeldoorn. In 2008 the largest paper mill of what was left of &quot;Van Gelder Papier&quot; after reorganizations went bankrupt. In 1996 a devastating fire destroyed the remnants of the last part of the original factory. Other parts of the production facility that remained are now in use as a production facility by AFP (Apeldoorn Flexible Packaging B.V.), since early 2021 known as &quot;Trioworld&quot; because AFP merged with &quot;Trioplast&quot;, Loparex B.V. and Owens Corning Veil Netherlands B.V. On the entire industrial estate now known as &quot;Van Gelder Park&quot; are now also located a local head office of Rabobank, the main police and fire department offices along with some other local companies.

Apeldoorn has a considerable meat processing industry with production and storage facilities of among others; Vion NV, Van Drie Group (ESA, Ekro), Grolleman Groep (cold stores, transport and meat processing), Amsterdam Meat Company (Ameco). Other big/larger companies or ones that are of local importance include Hanos international (horesca), Hamer B.V. (installation), HSL Logistics (since merged with GVT Logistics), HCA Holland Colours (industrial plastics coloring), Remeha (heating boilers), Royal Reesink N.V. The former distribution centre is now used as a distribution centre for Picnic, an internet grocery home delivery service, although Royal Reesink is still using the office parts of the building.

In August 2018 PostNL opened a large package sorting centre at the Oude Apeldoornseweg, newly built at the industrial area now known as &quot;FizzionParc&quot; but once was known as an industrial estate of Philips Data Systems, the new PostNL location will provide work for around 400 employees.

On 27 November 2018, a rapid spreading fire completely destroyed the largest store of &quot;Karwei&quot; DIY centres in The Netherlands, located at the Laan van de Dierenriem in Apeldoorn. No one was injured, and as of 2020 the location was rebuilt and reopened. A part of the new building is now up for rent for another business.

Akzo Diosynth once operated a facility that produced base materials for medicine manufacture, but production has since ceased. The terrain located at the Vlijtseweg has been renamed after the product that was produced here before that, Zwitsal. It is now known as &quot;Zwitsal Apeldoorn&quot; and the former facility now houses many new local businesses, such as the beer brewery &quot;De Vlijt&quot;.

Apenheul is a zoo which hosts a number of different types of apes and monkeys, many of which are free to walk around the visitors. It is situated at the western edge of Apeldoorn and can easily be reached by local bus. There is also an amusement park situated in Apeldoorn, called the &quot;Koningin Juliana Toren&quot; (Queen Juliana Tower). It is situated nearby the Apenheul and lies on the road to Hoog Soeren. It is called the Koningin Juliana Toren because of the tower, which was built in 1910 and was later named after Queen Juliana.

The local hospital is the Gelre Hospital &quot;Lukas&quot;, offering secondary health care to Apeldoorn and the surrounding towns.

Apeldoorn railway station is, among regular national and international services, the terminus for the Veluwse Stoomtrein Maatschappij, a preserved steam railway that runs to Dieren via Beekbergen.

In April 2009 Apeldoorn made world news, when eight people were killed after a man tried to attack the Dutch royal family during a Queen&#x27;s Day celebration by crashing his car near the royal family&#x27;s bus.

The southwestern corner of the municipality is part of the Hoge Veluwe National Park.
It is the final Battle Honour of The Royal Canadian Regiment who took part in the town&#x27;s liberation in World War II.

== House of Orange-Nassau ==
Paleis Het Loo reflects the historical ties between the House of Orange-Nassau and the Netherlands. The central part of the palace and the lateral pavilions show how the palace was inhabited by the House of Orange for three centuries starting with the King Stadtholder William III of England up to and including Queen Wilhelmina.

In November 1684 Prince William III of Orange, then Stadtholder of Gelderland, purchased Het Loo with the intentions of building a palatial hunting lodge somewhere on the property. On 5 April 1685, the first contract was tendered and in September of the same year the stonework of the middle section (or corps de logis) of what came to be known as Het Loo was completed. In 1686, the year given on the facade of the building, the wings, originally linked by colonnades to the corps de logis were added, the walls were built and the gardens were laid out.

Het Loo became the favorite hunting seat and country palace of William III and his wife Princess Mary II, and until his death in 1702 furnishings and decorations both inside and outside underwent repeated alterations and embellishments. At that time symmetry was considered ideal and the design for the building and grounds featured a central axis with mirror image components on either side. Inside the palace the axis consisted of the Entrance Hall, the Staircase and the Great Hall on the first floor. West and east of the Great Hall respectively were the apartments of William III and Mary II. The apartments of the courtiers and the Dining Room were on the ground floor.

In 1689 William III became King of England, Scotland and Ireland and this elevation of his position and power brought an enlargement of Het Loo in its wake. Between 1691 and 1694 the colonnades which linked the corps de logis to the wings on either side were replaced by four pavilions. These pavilions contained the new apartments of William III and Mary II, a new Dining Room, a Long Gallery and a Chapel. Queen Mary did not return to the Netherlands after 1689 and never saw the enlargement.

On the death of King William III in 1702 there was disagreement about his inheritance, but eventually, in 1732, Het Loo descended to Willem IV (1711–1751) who was, from 1747, Stadtholder of all the provinces. Both Willem IV and his son Willem V (1748–1806) used the palace in the 18th century as a summer residence.

<doc id="84806" wikidata="Q973014" url="?curid=84806" title="Dream of the Rarebit Fiend">
<text>Dream of the Rarebit Fiend is a newspaper comic strip by American cartoonist Winsor McCay, begun September 10, 1904. It was McCay&#x27;s second successful strip, after &quot;Little Sammy Sneeze&quot; secured him a position on the cartoon staff of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; appeared in the &quot;Evening Telegram&quot;, a newspaper published by the &quot;Herald&quot;. For contractual reasons, McCay signed the strip with the pen name &quot;Silas&quot;.

The strip had no continuity or recurring characters, but a recurring theme: a character has a nightmare or other bizarre dream, usually after eating a Welsh rarebit—a cheese-on-toast dish. The character awakens in the closing panel and regrets having eaten the rarebit. The dreams often reveal unflattering sides of the dreamers&#x27; psyches—their phobias, hypocrisies, discomforts, and dark fantasies. This was in great contrast to the colorful fantasy dreams in McCay&#x27;s signature strip &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, which he began in 1905. Whereas children were &quot;Nemo&quot;″s target audience, McCay aimed &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; at adults.

The popularity of &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; and &quot;Nemo&quot; led to McCay gaining a contract in 1911 with William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s chain of newspapers with a star&#x27;s salary. His editor there thought McCay&#x27;s highly skilled cartooning &quot;serious, not funny&quot;, and had McCay give up comic strips in favor of editorial cartooning. McCay revived the strip in 1923–1925 as &quot;Rarebit Reveries&quot;, of which few examples have survived.

A number of film adaptations of &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; have appeared, including Edwin S. Porter&#x27;s live-action &quot;Dream of a Rarebit Fiend&quot; in 1906, and four pioneering animated films by McCay himself: &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot; in 1912, and 1921&#x27;s &quot;Bug Vaudeville&quot;, &quot;The Pet&quot;, and &quot;The Flying House&quot;. The strip is said to have anticipated a number of recurring ideas in popular culture, such as marauding giant beasts damaging cities—as later popularized by &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

==Overview==
Winsor McCay first produced &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; in 1904, a year before the dream romps of his &quot;Little Nemo&quot; and a full generation before the artists of the Surrealist movement unleashed the unconscious on the public. The strip had no recurring characters, but followed a theme: after eating a Welsh rarebit, the day&#x27;s protagonist would be subject to the darker side of his psyche. Typically, the strip would begin with an absurd situation which became more and more absurd until the Fiend—the dreamer—awakened in the final panel. Some situations were merely silly: elephants falling from the ceiling, or two women&#x27;s mink coats having a fight. Other times, they could be more disturbing: characters finding themselves dismembered, buried alive from a first-person perspective or a child&#x27;s mother being planted and becoming a tree. In some strips the Fiend was a spectator watching fantastic or horrible things happen to someone close to . The protagonists are typically, but not always, of America’s growing middle-class urban population whom McCay subjects to fears of public humiliation, or loss of social esteem or respectability, or just the uncontrollably weird nature of being.

&quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; was the only one of McCay&#x27;s strips in which he approached social or political topics, or dealt with contemporary life. He addressed religious leaders, alcoholism, homelessness, political speeches, suicide, fashion, and other topics, whereas his other strips were fantasy or had seemingly vague, timeless backgrounds. The strip referenced contemporary events such as the 1904 election of Theodore Roosevelt; the recently built Flatiron Building (1902) and St. Regis Hotel (1904) in New York City; and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05.

The rarebit is a dish typically made with rich cheese thinned with ale and served melted on toast with cayenne and mustard mixed in. McCay used it despite its relative innocuousness: cultural theorist Scott Bukatman states rarebit was not the sort of dish a person would associate with having nightmares, thereby demonstrating his unfamiliarity with a belief long held - particularly in England - that the consumption of cheese - and more especially toasted cheese - was likely to cause unpleasant dreams. 

McCay&#x27;s most famous character, Little Nemo, first appeared in the first year of &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;, on December 10, 1904. In 1905, McCay had Nemo appear in his own strip in the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. In comparison to &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, the artwork of the &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strips had minimal backgrounds, and were usually done from a static perspective with the main characters often in a fixed position. The content of &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; played a much bigger role than it did in &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, whose focus was on beautiful visuals. The stories were self-contained, whereas the &quot;Nemo&quot; story continued from week to week. The dreams in &quot;Nemo&quot; were aimed at children, but &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; had adult-oriented subjects—social embarrassment, fear of dying or going insane, and so on. Some of the dreams in both strips were wish-fulfillment fantasies.

Unlike most comic strips from the time, &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; is not (directly) humorous or escapist. The strips highlight readers&#x27; darker selves—hypocrisies, deceitfulness, phobias, and discomfort. They offer often biting social commentary and show marital, money, and religious matters in a negative light. McCay had an interest in pushing formal boundaries, and playful self-referentiality plays a role in many of the strips; characters sometimes refer to McCay&#x27;s alter-ego &quot;Silas&quot; or to the reader. Though frequent in &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;, this self-referentiality does not appear in McCay&#x27;s other strips.

In contrast to the skilled artwork, the lettering in the dialogue balloons, as in McCay&#x27;s other work, was awkward and could approach illegibility, especially in reproductions, where the artwork has normally been greatly reduced in size. McCay seemed to show little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the composition. They tend to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and show that McCay&#x27;s gift was in the visual and not the verbal.

==Background==
McCay began cartooning in the 1890s and had a prolific output published in magazines and newspapers. He became known for his ability to draw quickly, a talent he often employed during chalk talks on the vaudeville stage (alongside the likes of Harry Houdini and W. C. Fields). Before &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; and &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, McCay had shown an interest in the topic of dreams. Some of his earlier works, numbering at least 10 regular comic strips, had titles such as &quot;Daydreams&quot; and &quot;It Was Only a Dream&quot;. McCay&#x27;s were not the first dream-themed comic strips to be published: McCay&#x27;s employer, the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, had printed at least three such strips, beginning with Charles Reese&#x27;s &quot;Drowsy Dick&quot; in 1902. Psychoanalysis and dream interpretation had begun to enter the public consciousness with the 1900 publication of Freud&#x27;s &quot;Interpretation of Dreams&quot;.

McCay first proposed a strip in which a tobacco fiend finds himself at the North Pole, unable to secure a cigarette and a light. In the last panel he awakens to find it a dream. The &quot;Herald&quot; asked McCay to make a series of the strip, but with a Welsh rarebit theme instead of tobacco, and McCay complied. The strip appeared in a &quot;Herald&quot; subsidiary, the &quot;Evening Telegram&quot;, and the &quot;Herald&quot;s editor required McCay to use a pseudonym for the strip work to keep it separate from his other work. McCay signed &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strips as &quot;Silas&quot;, a name he borrowed from a neighborhood garbage cart driver. After switching to William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot; newspaper in 1911, McCay dropped the &quot;Silas&quot; pseudonym and signed his work with his own name.

McCay married in 1891, and the marriage was not a happy one. According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay depicts marriage in &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; as &quot;a minefield of hypocrisy, jealousy, and misunderstanding&quot;. McCay was a short man, barely five feet () tall. He was dominated by his wife, who stood as tall as he was. Images of small, shy men dominated by their taller or fatter wives appear frequently in &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;. Gigantism, with characters overwhelmed by rapidly growing elements, was another recurring motif, perhaps as compensation on McCay&#x27;s part for a sense of smallness. McCay&#x27;s brother Arthur had been put in a mental asylum, which may have inspired the themes of insanity that are common in the strip.

Despite the strip&#x27;s bleak view, McCay&#x27;s work was so popular that William Randolph Hearst hired him in 1911 with a star&#x27;s salary. Hearst editor Arthur Brisbane deemed McCay&#x27;s work &quot;serious, not funny&quot;, and had the cartoonist give up his comic strips (including &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; and &quot;Nemo&quot;) to work full-time illustrating editorials.

===Influences===
Scholars such as Claude Moliterni, Ulrich Merkl, Alfredo Castelli, and others have located possible influences. These include Edward Lear&#x27;s popular &quot;The Book of Nonsense&quot; (1870), Gelett Burgess&#x27; &quot;The Burgess Nonsense Book&quot; (1901), Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) (particularly the pool of tears scene, which seems related to the flood of sweat in one early &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strip), and a variety of dream cartoons and illustrations that appeared in various periodicals McCay was likely familiar with.

The most probable influence on the strip was &quot;Welsh Rarebit Tales&quot; (1902) by Harle Oren Cummins. Cummins stated that he drew inspiration for this collection of fifteen science fiction stories from nightmares brought on by eating Welsh rarebit and lobster. Several of McCay&#x27;s post-&quot;Herald&quot; strips from 1911 and 1912 were even titled &quot;Dream of a Lobster Fiend&quot;.

Other influences have been established: H. G. Wells, L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900), J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; (1904), Carlo Collodi&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; (1883), Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Adventure of the Engineer&#x27;s Thumb&quot; (1889), Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1896), Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886), and Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The 1,000,000 Pound Bank-Note&quot; (1893).

McCay never acknowledged the influence of Sigmund Freud, whose &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; had been published in 1900. McCay scholar Ulrich Merkl says it was likely McCay was aware of the Viennese doctor&#x27;s theories, as they had been widely reported and talked about in the New York newspaper world of which was McCay was a part.

==Publishing history==
&quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; was McCay&#x27;s longest running comic strip. He made over 300 more &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; episodes than he made of the more famous &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. The first strip appeared on September 10, 1904, in the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, a few months after the first appearance of McCay&#x27;s &quot;Little Sammy Sneeze&quot;. It was McCay&#x27;s second successful newspaper strip, after &quot;Sammy Sneeze&quot; landed him a position on the cartooning staff of the &quot;Herald&quot;. &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; ran in the &quot;Evening Telegram&quot;, which was published by the &quot;Herald&quot; at the time.

The strip appeared two to three times a week. It typically filled a quarter of a newspaper page on weekdays, and half a page on Saturdays. The strip normally appeared in black-and-white, but 29 of the strips appeared in color throughout 1913, run weekly in the &quot;Herald&quot;. These were strips drawn between 1908 and 1911 which the &quot;Evening Telegram&quot; had neglected to print. McCay sometimes encouraged readers to submit dream ideas, to be sent care of the &quot;Herald&quot; to &quot;Silas the Dreamer&quot;. McCay acknowledged the submissions he accepted with a &quot;thanks to ...&quot; on the strip beside his own signature. Among those credited were science fiction pioneer Hugo Gernsback.

&quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; initial run continued until 1911. It appeared again in various papers between 1911 and 1913 under other titles, such as &quot;Midsummer Day Dreams&quot; and &quot;It Was Only a Dream&quot;. From 1923 to 1925 McCay revived the strip under the title &quot;Rarebit Reveries&quot;. Though signed &quot;Robert Winsor McCay Jr.&quot; (McCay&#x27;s son), the strips appear to be in McCay&#x27;s own hand, with the possible exception of the lettering. McCay had also signed some of his animation and editorial cartoons with his son&#x27;s name. As of 2007 only seven examples of &quot;Rarebit Reveries&quot; were known, though it is nearly certain others were printed.

===Collections===
The earliest collection, titled &quot;Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;, appeared in 1905 from Frederick A. Stokes and reprinted 61 of the strips. Dover Publications reprinted this collection in 1973 in a 10% enlarged edition with new introductory material. The Dover edition dropped the final strip from the original collection as it contained ethnic humor that the publisher believed would not be to the taste of a 1970s audience.

&quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; examples appear in &quot;Daydreams and Nightmares&quot; (Fantagraphics, 1988/2006; editor Richard Marschall), a collection of miscellaneous work by McCay. Checker Books reprinted many of the &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strips over eight volumes of the series &quot;Winsor McCay: Early Works&quot; and in 2006 reprinted 183 of the color Saturday strips in &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend: The Saturdays&quot;. The Checker books reprinted all but about 300 of the known &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strips.

In July 2007, German art historian Ulrich Merkl self-published a , 464-page volume called &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;, reproducing 369 of the strips in full size. Previous reprintings of the strip reduced the strips to about a third of their originally published size, resulting in loss of detail and making the lettering hard to read. The size of the book made automatic binding impossible, so it had to be bound by hand. The book was limited to 1000 copies, and a DVD was included with scans of the 821 known installments of the strip, the complete text of the book, a &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; of the strips, and a video of an example of McCay&#x27;s animation. The sources of the strips were from Merkl&#x27;s personal collection, the Cartoon Research Library of the Ohio State University, and microfilms purchased from the New York Public Library containing the complete &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; run of the strip. Merkl has said that, on average, six hours were required per strip for scanning and restoration. The book also featured two essays by Italian comics editor Alfredo Castelli and one by Jeremy Taylor, former president of the International Association for the Study of Dreams.

==Other media==
McCay&#x27;s work was very popular. It was adapted to film by McCay and others, and was optioned for Broadway. A &quot;comic opera or musical extravanganza&quot; called &quot;Dream of the Welsh Rarebit Fiend&quot; went unproduced, though McCay signed a contract to collaborate on it with music by Max Hirschfeld and lyrics by George Henry Payne and Robert Gilbert Welch.

===Film===
====&quot;Dream of a Rarebit Fiend&quot; (1906)====
Film pioneer Edwin S. Porter produced a seven-minute live-action film adaptation called &quot;The Dream of a Rarebit Fiend&quot; in 1906 for the Edison Company. The Fiend was played by John P. Brawn, who is tormented by imps in his bed, which flies through the air and leaves him hanging from a steeple—a scene similar to that of an early strips that ran on January 28, 1905.

====Animation by McCay====
McCay produced four hand-drawn animated films based upon his &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; series:

=====&quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot; (1912)=====
Put together in December 1911, and released in 1912, McCay&#x27;s second film (also known as &quot;The Story of a Mosquito&quot;) is one of the earliest examples of line-drawn animation. A giant top-hatted mosquito flies in through a window to feed on a man in bed, who tries in vain to defend himself. The mosquito drinks itself so full that it explodes. Rather than expanding like a balloon, the mosquito fills up in a naturalistic fashion according to its body structure. The idea for the film came from a &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strip published on June 5, 1909. McCay biographer John Canemaker commends McCay for his ability to imbue the mosquito with character and a personality.

=====&quot;Bug Vaudeville&quot; (1921)=====
 The series title is pluralized for this film. In the fantasy &quot;Bug Vaudeville&quot;, a tramp comes out from a group of meticulously drawn trees and falls asleep, muttering that cheese cakes give him strange dreams. A series of bugs put on performance after performance against highly detailed and realistic backgrounds. The performance ends with a spider who grabs a silhouetted member of the audience and eats him whole.

The film was released around September 12, 1921, and draws from McCay&#x27;s experiences in the worlds of the circus and vaudeville. The film is presented as a vaudeville show, though without the stage interaction McCay used in &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot;. Film critic Andrew Sarris praised &quot;Bug Vaudeville&quot; as his favorite of McCay&#x27;s films for &quot;the linear expressiveness of the drawings and the intuitive rhythm of the acts&quot;. Sarris wrote that a director like Federico Fellini &quot;would be honored by such insight into the ritual of performance&quot;.

=====&quot;The Pet&quot; (1921)=====

The series title is pluralized for this title. &quot;The Pet&quot; depicts a couple who adopt a mysterious animal with an insatiable appetite. It consumes its milk, the house cat, the house&#x27;s furnishings, rat poison, and passing vehicles, including airplanes and a blimp, while growing larger and larger. As it wanders among the skyscrapers of the city a swarm of airplanes and zeppelins gather to bomb the beast.

A &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strip from March 8, 1905, inspired &quot;The Pet&quot;, which was released around September 19, 1921. The dark film was the last over which McCay had &quot;total creative control&quot;, according to McCay biographer John Canemaker. Cartoonist Stephen R. Bissette called it &quot;the first-ever &#x27;giant monster attacking a city&#x27; motion picture ever made&quot;.

=====&quot;The Flying House&quot; (1921)=====

Against the backdrop of the rapidly urbanizing United States of the 1910s and 1920s, one house from the artificial grid of modern, planned America takes flight in the dream of a woman who has feasted on Welsh rarebit. &quot;The Flying House&quot; is rendered in meticulous realistic detail. The house is conventional in every respect—until the viewer reaches the attic, where the woman&#x27;s husband is seen tending an enormous engine. He attaches a propeller to a shaft out front of the house, and tells his wife that his actions are in reaction to their landlord&#x27;s intention to evict them over nonpayment. He says he plans to &quot;steal the house&quot;, and the couple fly away to find a place where their landlord will never find them—a swamp, the ocean, even the moon, where they are chased off by the Man in the Moon with a flyswatter. The film self-consciously directs the viewers to notice the quality and accuracy of the animation when the house takes off into space, calling attention to the &quot;remarkable piece of animation which follows&quot;, accurately showing the revolutions of the Earth and Moon and the &quot;beautiful constellation of Orion&quot;. In the end, the house is struck by a military rocket, bringing the nightmare to an end as the woman awakens in her bed.

The title card reverts to the singular &quot;Dream&quot; for the series title and credits Winsor &quot;Selias&quot; McCay as the producer. The film was released on September 26, 1921, and was credited to McCay&#x27;s son Robert, though Canemaker states it is unlikely the elder McCay was not involved. A 1921 &quot;New York Times&quot; review found the film &quot;interesting because of its excellent workmanship and fantastic character&quot; though it was &quot;not as brightly humorous&quot; as it could be. Film critic Richard Eder contrasted the film&#x27;s realistic nightmarishness with the more innocent qualities that came to be associated with American cartoons. In 2011, animator Bill Plympton restored the film, using Kickstarter to fund the project. He had the film colorized, and actors Matthew Modine and Patricia Clarkson provided voices.

===Music===

The Edison Military Band performed a piece called &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; on an Edison cylinder (Edison 9585) in 1907, written by Thomas W. Thurban. The music was likely inspired by Porter&#x27;s 1906 film, and may have been intended to accompany it. The piece was written for an 18–20-piece band, and has been recorded numerous times.

==Legacy==
&quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; set up a formula which McCay was to use in the better-known &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. A large number of the Nemo strips used ideas recycled from &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;, such as the October 31, 1907, &quot;walking bed&quot; episode, which was used in the July 26, 1908, episode of &quot;Little Nemo&quot;.

Comics scholar Jeet Heer called &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; &quot;perhaps the most bizarre newspaper feature in American history&quot;. Merkl notes examples of the strip presaging ideas and scenes in later media: the strip includes scenes in which a man kicks a dog, slaps a woman, beats a blind man, and throws another woman out a window, as in Luis Buñuel&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or&quot; (1930); and giant characters let loose in the big city, climbing and damaging buildings and subway trains, as in &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933). Merkl compares the strip for March 9, 1907, in which a child&#x27;s bedroom becomes a lion-infested jungle, to the 1950 Ray Bradbury story &quot;The Veldt&quot;, and the strip from September 26, 1908, depicting a stretchable face, to Salvador Dalí&#x27;s surrealist painting &quot;Soft self-portrait with fried bacon&quot; (1941) and the cosmetic surgeries in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Brazil&quot;. Stephen R. Bissette compares a strip featuring elevators flying from buildings and other scenes to the 2005 Tim Burton&#x27;s take on &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

The strip was most likely an influence on episodes of Frank King&#x27;s early comic strip &quot;Bobby Make-Believe&quot;. Many scholars believe that Carl Barks, a professed fan of &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, was likely exposed to &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, which Barks read growing up. Several episodes of Barks&#x27;s Donald Duck strips appear to have taken their subjects from &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;. Many scenes from animated films by Tex Avery from between 1943 and 1954 are said to show clearly a &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; influence. Science fiction illustrator Frank R. Paul painted a number of pulp magazine covers influenced by &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;.

Art Spiegelman paid parodic homage to &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; in his 1974 strip &quot;Real Dream&quot;. In 1991, Rick Veitch began producing short comics based on his dreams. Beginning in 1994, he put out twenty-one issues of &quot;Roarin&#x27; Rick&#x27;s Rare Bit Fiends&quot; from his own King Hell Press. John Ashbery published a poem titled &quot;Dream of a Rarebit Fiend&quot;.

<text>Tàrrega (, ) is a town and municipality located in the Urgell comarca, Province of Lleida, Catalonia. According to the 2020 census (Statistical Institute of Catalonia), the town has a population of 17,445.

The village has a Mediterranean climate with certain influences from the Continental climate. Local attractions include a park at Sant Eloi mountain () with a Romanesque church of the 13th century. Its theatre fair, held annually each September, attracts over 100,000 people a year.

==History==
Tàrrega&#x27;s growth began in the 11th century, when Count Ramon Berenguer I conquered its castle. Located at a strategic crossroad, medieval Tàrrega became an important economic and territorial possession. Indications of the town&#x27;s vitality at the time include its Jewish community, its fairs and markets, and its large amount of artisans (especially goldsmiths). This period of prosperity was ended by the Black Death, which depopulated the town. 

On 26 July 1348, the Jews of Tàrrega were victims of one of the earliest episodes of anti-Jewish violence related to the Black Death. Both Christian and Jewish sources attest to the murders. It is estimated that 800 Jews were murdered. (In 2007, excavations in Tàrrega identified the possible location of the medieval Jewish cemetery. Subsequent excavations confirmed that multiple individuals buried in six communal graves had suffered violent deaths.)

Construction of Tàrrega&#x27;s walls began to monopolize its resources, spurred by the fear of feudal violence. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, Tàrrega began to take on a more rural character, controlled by rich local families. A series of wars in the region caused instability in the city, as well as three revolts of Carlists.

In the second half of 19th century, Tàrrega underwent a revival. Important events in this time included the inauguration of a railway line connecting the town with Manresa and Lleida in 1860, reconstruction of the walls after a flood in 1874, and the granting of the title of city by King Alfonso XII in 1884. This period also saw the establishment of modern infrastructure in the city.

==Geography==
The city of Tàrrega is arranged around the square of Carme, better known as &quot;the Courtyard&quot; (). The square features a statue of the classical composer Ramon Carnicer, a famous Tàrrega resident. Adjacent to the square is the Convent of Carme, a Renaissance cloister which dates to the 16th century. Notable buildings in the town square include the town council building, built in 1674, as well as the 19th century modernist chamber of commerce building and the 1910 La Caixa savings bank.

Other local landmarks include the museum on the main street, which still preserves some noble rooms from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the church of Saint Anthony () in the square of the same name, which dates back to the 14th century. Higher up are the ruins of the castle of Count Ramon Berenguer, constructed in 1056. Little remains of the castle.

The municipality includes the villages of El Talladell, Claravalls, Altet, Santa Maria de Montmagastrell, La Figuerosa, Riudovelles, and Conill (abandoned).

<doc id="84808" wikidata="Q221945" url="?curid=84808" title="Butylated hydroxytoluene">
<text>Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), also known as dibutylhydroxytoluene, is a lipophilic organic compound, chemically a derivative of phenol, that is useful for its antioxidant properties. BHT is widely used to prevent free radical-mediated oxidation in fluids (e.g. fuels, oils) and other materials, and the regulations overseen by the U.S. F.D.A.—which considers BHT to be &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot;—allow small amounts to be added to foods. Despite this, and the earlier determination by the National Cancer Institute that BHT was noncarcinogenic in an animal model, societal concerns over its broad use have been expressed. BHT has also been postulated as an antiviral drug, but as of December 2022, use of BHT as a drug is not supported by the scientific literature and it has not been approved by any drug regulatory agency for use as an antiviral.

== Natural occurrence ==
Phytoplankton, including the green algae &quot;Botryococcus braunii&quot;, as well as three different cyanobacteria (&quot;Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii&quot;, &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Oscillatoria&quot; sp.) are capable of producing BHT as a natural product. The fruit lychee also produces BHT in its pericarp. Several fungi (for example &quot;Aspergillus conicus&quot;) living in olives produce BHT.

== Production ==
===Industrial production===
The chemical synthesis of BHT in industry has involved the reaction of &quot;p&quot;-cresol (4-methylphenol) with isobutylene (2-methylpropene), catalyzed by sulfuric acid:

:CH3(C6H4)OH + 2 CH2=C(CH3)2 → ((CH3)3C)2CH3C6H2OH
Alternatively, BHT has been prepared from 2,6-di-&quot;tert&quot;-butylphenol by hydroxymethylation or aminomethylation followed by hydrogenolysis.

== Reactions ==

The species behaves as a synthetic analog of vitamin E, primarily acting as a terminating agent that suppresses autoxidation, a process whereby unsaturated (usually) organic compounds are attacked by atmospheric oxygen. BHT stops this autocatalytic reaction by converting peroxy radicals to hydroperoxides. It effects this function by donating a hydrogen atom:
:RO2• + ArOH → ROOH + ArO•
:RO2• + ArO• → nonradical products
where R is alkyl or aryl, and where ArOH is BHT or related phenolic antioxidants. Each BHT consumes two peroxy radicals. The electron-donating alkyl groups on the &quot;ortho&quot; and &quot;para&quot; positions of BHT increase the electron density of the phenolic hydroxyl moiety through the inductive effect and the hyperconjugation effect, reduce the bond dissociation energy of the phenolic hydroxyl group, and enhance its reactivity to lipid free radicals. Meanwhile, the phenoxy radical generated by BHT is stabilized due to the delocalization of unpaired electrons around the aromatic ring and the steric hindrance effect of ortho &quot;tert&quot;-butyl groups. Isobutene is one of the possible degradation products formed by BHT oxidation with computational studies suggesting that there are two possible mechanism that can lead to isobutene formation with the OH addition pathways at the C2 site of BHT more likely to result in isobutene formation than pathways of H abstracts from the &quot;t&quot;-butyl group.

== Applications ==
BHT is listed by the NIH Hazardous Substances Data Bank under several categories in catalogues and databases, such as food additive, household product ingredient, industrial additive, personal care product/cosmetic ingredient, pesticide ingredient, plastic/rubber ingredient and medical/veterinary/research.

=== Food additive ===
BHT is primarily used as an antioxidant food additive. In the United States, it is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) based on a National Cancer Institute study from 1979 in rats and mice. It is approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration: For example, 21 CFR § 137.350(a)(4) allows BHT up to 0.0033% by weight in &quot;enriched rice&quot;, while 9 CFR § 381.147](f)(1) allows up to 0.01% in poultry &quot;by fat content&quot;. It is permitted in the European Union under E321.

BHT is used as a preservative ingredient in some foods. With this usage BHT maintains freshness or prevents spoilage; it may be used to decrease the rate at which the texture, color, or flavor of food changes.

Some food companies have voluntarily eliminated BHT from their products or have announced that they were going to phase it out.

=== Antioxidant ===
BHT is also used as an antioxidant in products such as metalworking fluids, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, rubber, transformer oils, and embalming fluid. In the petroleum industry, where BHT is known as the fuel additive AO-29, it is used in hydraulic fluids, turbine and gear oils, and jet fuels. BHT is also used to prevent peroxide formation in organic ethers and other solvents and laboratory chemicals. It is added to certain monomers as a polymerisation inhibitor to facilitate their safe storage. Some additive products contain BHT as their primary ingredient, while others contain the chemical merely as a component of their formulation, sometimes alongside butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA).

=== Cosmetics ===
The European Union restricts the use of BHT in mouthwash to 0.001% concentration, in toothpaste to 0.01% concentration, and to 0.8% in other cosmetics.

== Health effects ==

Like many closely related phenol antioxidants, BHT has low acute toxicity (e.g., the desmethyl analog of BHT, 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, has an of &gt;9 g/kg). The US Food and Drug Administration classifies BHT as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food preservative when used in an approved manner. In 1979, the National Cancer Institute determined that BHT was noncarcinogenic in a mouse model.

Nevertheless, the World Health Organization discussed a possible link between BHT and cancer risk in 1986, and some primary research studies in the 1970s–1990s reported both potential for increased risk and potential for decreased risk in the area of oncology. Because of this uncertainty, the Center for Science in the Public Interest puts BHT in its &quot;caution&quot; column and recommends avoiding it.

Based on various, disparate primary research reports, BHT has been suggested to have anti-viral activity, and the reports divide into various study types. First, there are studies that describe virus inactivation—where treatment with the chemical results in disrupted or otherwise inactivated virus particles. The action of BHT in these is akin to the action of many other organic compounds, e.g., quaternary ammonium compounds, phenolics, and detergents, which disrupt viruses by insertion of the chemical into the virus membrane, coat, or other structure, which are established methods of viral disinfection secondary to methods of chemical oxidation and UV irradiation. In addition, there is a report of BHT use, topically against genital herpes lesions, a report of inhibitory activity &quot;in vitro&quot; against pseudorabies (in cell culture), and two studies, in veterinary contexts, of use of BHT to attempt to protect against virus exposure (pseudorabies in mouse and swine, and Newcastle in chickens). The relevance of other reports, regarding influenza in mice, is not easily discerned. Notably, this series of primary research reports does not support a general conclusion of independent confirmation of the original research results, nor are there critical reviews appearing thereafter, in secondary sources, for the various host-virus systems studied with BHT.

Hence, at present, the results do not present a scientific consensus in favour of the conclusion of the general antiviral potential of BHT when dosed in humans. Moreover, as of March 2020, no guidance from any of the internationally recognized associations of infectious disease specialists had advocated use of BHT products as an antiviral therapy or prophylactic.

<text>Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) is a synthetic, waxy, solid petrochemical. Its antioxidant properties have caused it to be widely used as a preservative in food, food packaging, animal feed, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, rubber, and petroleum products. BHA has been used in food since around 1947.

==Chemistry==
BHA consists of a mixture of two isomeric organic compounds, 2-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and 3-&quot;tert&quot;-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. It is prepared from 4-methoxyphenol and isobutylene.

The conjugated aromatic ring of BHA is able to stabilize free radicals, sequestering them. By acting as free radical scavengers, further free radical reactions are prevented.

==Applications==
Since 1947, BHA has been added to edible fats and fat-containing foods for its antioxidant properties as it prevents rancidification of food which creates objectionable odors. It has been assigned the E number E320. It is often combined with a similar chemical, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).

BHA also is commonly used in medicines, such as cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), isotretinoin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, among others.

==Health effects==
The U.S. National Institutes of Health report that BHA is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In particular, when administered in high doses as part of their diet, BHA causes papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach in rats and Syrian golden hamsters. In mice, there is no carcinogenic effect; in fact, there is evidence of a protective effect against the carcinogenicity of other chemicals.

When examining human population statistics, the usual low intake levels of BHA show no significant association with an increased risk of cancer.

The European Commission has conducted an evaluation of literature. They noted the lack of potential for the compound to induce carcinogenic effects in humans; studies showing carcinogenic effects in hamsters are not relevant to humans (which lack a forestomach). Also noted is that endocrine disruption, if any, is only likely to be present at levels vastly exceeding the intake as a food. 

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) – Summaries &amp; Evaluations stated butylated hydroxyanisole was tested for carcinogenicity in two experiments in rats and in two experiments in hamsters by administration in the diet, inducing benign and malignant tumours of the forestomach. 

One of its metabolites is TBHQ (&quot;t&quot;-butylhydroquinone), a preservative made infamous by food writer Michael Pollan.

<text>Vladimir Batagelj (born June 14, 1948 in Idrija, Yugoslavia) is a Slovenian mathematician and an emeritus professor of mathematics at the University of Ljubljana. He is known for his work in discrete mathematics and combinatorial optimization, particularly analysis of social networks and other large networks (blockmodeling).

==Education and career==
Vladimir Batagelj completed his Ph.D. at the University of Ljubljana in 1986 under the direction of Tomaž Pisanski.

He stayed at the University of Ljubljana as a professor until his retirement, where he was a professor of sociology and statistics, while also being a chair of the Department of Sociology of the Faculty of Social Sciences. As visiting professor, he was taught at the University of Pittsburgh (1990-91) and at the University of Konstanz (2002). He was also a member of editorial boards of two journals: &quot;Informatica&quot; and &quot;Journal of Social Structure&quot;.

His work has been cited over 11000 times.

His book &quot;Exploratory Social Network Analysis with Pajek&quot; on blockmodeling, coauthored with Wouter de Nooy and Andrej Mrvar, is Batagelj&#x27;s most cited work and has over 3300 citations. The book was translated into Chinese and Japanese. The revised and expanded third edition has been published by Cambridge University Press.

In 1975, 11 years before completing his PhD, Batagelj published a solo paper in Communications of the ACM.

Batagelj authored more than 20 textbooks in Slovenian, covering topics like TeX, combinatorics and discrete mathematics.
He has also written extensively in the Slovenian popular science journal &quot;Presek&quot;.

Batagelj has advised 9 Ph.D. students.

<text>Motley is the traditional costume of the court jester, the motley fool, or the arlecchino character in &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;. The harlequin wears a patchwork of red, green and blue diamonds that is still a fashion motif.

The word &quot;motley&quot; is described in the Oxford English Dictionary as a cognate of &quot;medley&quot;, although the unrelated &quot;mottled&quot; has also contributed to the meaning. The word is most commonly used as an adjective or noun, but is also seen as a verb and adverb. When used as a noun, it can mean &quot;a varied mixture&quot;. As an adjective, it is generally disparaging: a &quot;motley collection&quot; is an uninspiring pile of stuff, as in the cliché .

The word originated in England between the 14th and 17th centuries and referred to a woollen fabric of mixed colours. It was the characteristic dress of the professional fool. During the reign of Elizabeth I, motley served the important purpose of keeping the fool outside the social hierarchy and therefore not subject to class distinction. Since the fool was outside the dress laws, the fool was able to speak more freely. 

Likewise, motley did not have to be checkered and has been recently thought to be one pattern with different coloured threads running through it.

<text>Gritstone or grit is a hard, coarse-grained, siliceous sandstone. This term is especially applied to such sandstones that are quarried for building material. British gritstone was used for millstones to mill flour, to grind wood into pulp for paper and for grindstones to sharpen blades. &quot;Grit&quot; is often applied to sandstones composed of angular sand grains. It may commonly contain small pebbles. 
&quot;Millstone Grit&quot; is an informal term for a succession of gritstones which are to be found in the Pennines (including the Peak District) of northern England. These sediments were laid down in the late (upper) Paleozoic era, in the Carboniferous period, in deltaic conditions. The Millstone Grit Group is a formal stratigraphic term for this sequence of rocks.

The gritstone edges of the Peak District are an important climbing area and the rock is much relished by English climbers, among whom it has almost cult status and is often referred to as &quot;God&#x27;s own rock&quot;. The rough surface provides outstanding friction, enabling climbers to stand on or grip the subtlest of features in the rock.

<doc id="84824" wikidata="Q11492" url="?curid=84824" title="Mataró">
<text>Mataró () is the capital and largest town of the Maresme county in Catalonia, Spain. It is located on the Maresme coast, to the south of Costa Brava, between Cabrera de Mar and Sant Andreu de Llavaneres, north-east of Barcelona. , it had a population of 129,749.

==History==

Mataró dates back to Roman times when it was a village known as &quot;Iluro&quot; or &quot;Illuro&quot;. The ruins of a first-century BC Roman bath house (known locally as the &quot;Torre Llauder&quot;) were recently discovered and can be visited. The coastal follows the same path as the original Roman road, Via Augusta.

Mataró was declared a city by royal decree, even though at the time (nineteenth century) the population fell short of the requirement for city status.

The first railway in peninsular Spain was the Mataró – Barcelona line which opened on 28 October 1848 by the Catalan businessman and Mataró native Miquel Biada. This line now forms part of the Renfe/Rodalies de Catalunya R1 suburban service between L&#x27;Hospitalet de Llobregat and Maçanet-Massanes. Mataró is also connected with Barcelona and Girona by the (freeway) and with Granollers by the .

During the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Mataró was the starting point for the marathon events.

==Main sights==
Mataró is the birthplace of the &quot;noucentista&quot; architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who designed the &quot;ajuntament&quot; (town hall) and several other notable buildings in the town:
* Casa Coll i Regàs.
* Casa Parera.
* Casa Sisternes.
* El Rengle.
* Hermitage of St. Simon.
* La Beneficiència.
* Mataró City Wall. (was built between 1569 and 1600 and was designed by the military engineer Jorge de Setara. This wall is supposed to follow, to a large extent, the line of the old Roman wall. It was built with small stones bound with lime mortar. The Mataró City Wall had seven large gates, as well as attached towers that gave it greater defence. During the 19th century, many sections of the old Mataró City Wall were demolished.)

Nearby the town are the archaeological remains of the Roman villa of Can Llauder.

==Agriculture==
The traditional vineyards were devastated by Phylloxera in the nineteenth century and only partially replanted, due to the growth of the tourist industry and the development of irrigation in the area. Potatoes were one of the first replacement crops to be introduced, especially the &quot;Royal Kidney&quot; variety, and Mataró obtained a &quot;Denominació d&#x27;Origen&quot; in 1932. &quot;Trocadero&quot; lettuce and peas are also grown, mostly for export. The production of cut flowers is less important than in other towns of the Maresme. Irrigated land made up of the of agricultural land in the municipality in 1986 (47% of the municipal territory).

In modern viticulture, the red mourvèdre grape variety is a better-known synonym for the grape known in Spain, the U.S., and Australia as mataro. Mataró, the city, is thought to be the likely origin of mataro, the wine grape.

==Climate==
Mataró has a borderline humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot; in Köppen climate classification) bordering with a Hot-summer mediterranean climate, (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;).

==Festivals, celebrations and events==

Several major events are celebrated annually in Mataró. Some of them are also celebrated in the rest of Catalonia and others, which have a religious origin, are part of the folklore and traditions of Spain and some other countries. Among all of them the most popular ones are:
* The three wise men in Mataró.

<text>Vic (; ) is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Osona, in the province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Vic is located from Barcelona and from Girona.

==Geography==

Vic lies in the middle of the Plain of Vic, equidistant from Barcelona and the Pyrenees.

Vic has persistent fog in winter as a result of a thermal inversion, with temperatures as low as -10 °C, an absolute record of -24 °C and episodes of cold and severe snowstorms. For this reason, and also for the relatively moist summers, the region&#x27;s natural vegetation includes the pubescent oak typical of the sub-Mediterranean climates of eastern France, Northern Italy and the Balkans.

== Names ==

Originally known as &quot;Auso&quot;, it was known in Latin as &quot;Vicus Ausonae&quot;. From Latin &quot;vicus&quot; (neighborhood or urban population), it became &quot;Vich&quot; in Old Catalan.

In 1538, Lorenzo de Padilla writes Vic Bique and it appears as Vique in the &quot;Memorial&quot; of the Bishop of Vic, Antonio Pascual (ca. 1694) In 1715, Spain&#x27;s Nueva Planta decrees for Catalonia gave the city the Spanish name of Vique; an invention which tried to avoid a consonant ending that is uncomfortable in the Spanish language, applying the logic of cases such as &quot;Mastrique&quot; (Maastricht). However, this artificial variant only remained for a time in Spanish official texts and, as early as 1789, it reappeared in the gazetteer as &quot;Vich&quot;.

In 1913 the new orthographic regulations by the Institute for Catalan Studies of 1913 eliminated from the Catalan language the mute h at the end of the word and in intervocalic position to simplify the spelling (Normes ortogràfiques). Other analogous cases are those of &quot;Montjuïch&quot;, &quot;Hostalrich&quot; and &quot;Reixach&quot;, which are now written as Montjuïc, Hostalric and Reixac, respectively.

Since 1982, the official name has been Vic.

== History ==

Vic is of ancient origin. In past times it was called &quot;Ausa&quot; by the Romans. Iberian coins bearing this name have been found there. The Visigoths called it Ausona. Sewage caps on sidewalks around the city will also read &quot;Vich&quot;, an old spelling of the name.

During the 8th and 9th centuries, Vic sat in the Spanish Marches that separated Frankish and Islamic forces. It was destroyed in 788 during a Muslim incursion. Afterwards only one quarter was rebuilt, which was called &quot;Vicus Ausonensis&quot; (&quot;vicus&quot; is Latin for city borough), from which the name Vic was derived. It was repopulated by Wilfred the Hairy in 878 who gained control over the high part of the city and gave up the lowest part to the bishop to construct the episcopal see. From then on, the city was ruled by the count of Barcelona and by the bishop of Vic.

At a council in Toulouges in 1027, the bishop of Vic established the first Peace and Truce of God that helped reduce private warfare.

During the 14th century, several Jews flocked to the city and attained prominence, such as Salomo Abraham Taroç. However, the Jewish community was destroyed in the Massacre of 1391.

During the 18th century the city was the first focus of the rebellion against the centralist policy of King Philip V of Spain. The conflict became the War of the Spanish Succession. 

In the early 20th century Vic had 9500 inhabitants, and in 1992 it hosted roller hockey events of the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics. The town has been described as &quot;a hotbed of secessionist sentiment&quot;.

An ETA car bombing in 1991 killed 10 people.

==Ecclesiastical history==

The bishopric is a suffragan of the archbishopric of Tarragona, bounded on the north by Girona, on the east by Girona and Barcelona, on the south by Barcelona and Tarragona, on the west by Tarragona and Lleida. It lies within the four Catalan provinces, but the greater part of it in that of Barcelona.

The introduction of Christianity was early. Martyrs of Ausa are recorded in the time of Emperor Decius, and in the earliest records of the Tarraconensian mention Bishop of Vic. None, however, is mentioned by name until 516 when Cinidius is named as assisting at the provincial Council of Tarragona and Girona. Aquilinus (589–99) attended the third Council of Toledo; Esteban, the fourth and one at Egara; Dominus, the sixth of Toledo; Guericus, the eighth; Wisefredus sent his vicar to the thirteenth, and attended in person the fifteenth and sixteenth. With this bishop ends the history of the Church of Ausona before the Saracen invasion.

The reconquest of Vic was begun in the time of Louis the Pious, who confided the civil government to Borrell, Count of Ausona, all ecclesiastical matters being under the direction of the Archbishop of Narbonne.

In 826 Vic fell once more into the hands of the Moors and was finally reconquered by Wilfred the Hairy, independent Count of Barcelona.

Count Wilfred dedicated the monastery of Ripoll to the Blessed Virgin, and obtained from the Archbishop of Narbonne the consecration of Godmarus as Bishop of Vic. The bishops and the family of Montcada disputed the right of sovereignty over the city until 1315, when Bishop Berenguer Saguardia ceded his rights to the king, James II, who also purchased the rights of the Montcada.

Bishop Atto (960–72) was a promoter of education. Many availed themselves of the advantages offered by his reforms, among them Gerbert, a monk from Aurillac (France), and Pope Sylvester II.

Another bishops of Vic was Oliba (1018–46), son of the Count of Besalú, and Abbot of Ripoll where he reconstructed and richly decorated the church. The dedication took place 15 January 1032. He also, with the help of Ermessenda, Countess of Barcelona, reconstructed the cathedral and dedicated it to Saints Peter and Paul on 31 August 1038. In the time of his successor Guillem of Balsareny the relics of its patron saints, the martyrs Lucianus and Marcianus, were found at Vic, and a council was held for the restoration of peace among the faithful.

Berenguer Sunifred reformed the chapter, expelling lax members and introducing regular observance. Berenguer obtained for himself the dignity of Archbishop of Tarragona, which was contested by the Bishop of Narbonne. Among the Spanish bishops who attended the Council of Trent was Acisclo Moya de Contreras, Bishop of Vic, who was accompanied by the theologian Pedro Mercado.

Among more recent bishops, Josep Morgades restored the monastery of Ripoll, destroyed and pillaged by the revolutionists, and reconsecrated its church on 1 July 1893. He also established at Vic an archaeological museum where he collected many treasures of medieval art which had been dispersed among the ancient churches of the diocese. The next Bishop of Vic was Josep Torras i Bages, a man of great culture and learning.

Other natives of the Vic diocese include:

* Saint Anthony Mary Claret, archbishop of Santiago de Cuba, confessor of Isabella II of Spain and founder of the Congregation of the Missionaries of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, in North America also known as the Claretians.
* Archbishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany, Dominican and first archbishop of San Francisco, California. 

Another part of the catholic culture is St. Michael the Archangel
== Culture ==
Among other centres and institutions working to promote culture education, Vic hosts:
*The &quot;Universitat de Vic&quot;, a young University that, according to its numbers, has grown to be the most important outside the four main cities of Catalonia.
*The &quot;Museu episcopal&quot;, a medieval art museum administered by the bishopric.
*The &quot;Museu de la pell&quot;, a museum dedicated to leathers. 
*The markets, trade fairs and festivals. Especially the &quot;Mercat de música viva de Vic &amp; Mercat Medieval&quot;.

==Economy==
For centuries, the city&#x27;s primary industrial and commercial activity was a textile industry, now almost disappeared. Nowadays, the pillars of the economy are agriculture and other alimentary industries, and construction.

The city produces sausages and other pork derivatives, especially &quot;fuet&quot;, a thin cured sausage. The making of cured sausages and cold meats stems from the long tradition of pig farming in the Vic plain.

==Main sights==

It is disputed whether the Church of Sant Pere Apòstol or Sta. Maria la Rodona was the first cathedral church. For centuries the bishops celebrated the first Christmas Mass in this church, and the third in that of Sant Pere.

The ancient Church of St. Mary was rebuilt from the foundations by Canon Guillem Bonfil in 1140, and consecrated forty years later by Bishop Pere Retorta. In 1787 it was demolished to make room for the new Cathedral. Bishop Jordi (915–38) reconsecrated the Church of Ripoll and also consecrated that of St. Mary of Manresa.

The original cathedral, which had but a single nave, thick walls, and few windows, was replaced by that built by Bishop Oliva. As early as the 13th century, Bishop Raimond d&#x27;Anglesola wrote a pastoral letter exhorting his people to contribute towards repairing the cathedral. In 1401 Bishop Diego de Heredia added a transept, and in 1585 the door of Sant Joan was added, but the necessity of a complete reconstruction was soon recognised, and towards the end of the 18th century the building was torn down, and the cornerstone of the new one was laid on 24 September 1781. It was consecrated on 15 September 1803. It is classic in design, a combination of Doric and Tuscan, with a façade of white stone enriched with a balustrade. It has three entrances, corresponding to the three naves, and colossal statutes of its six patrons. The interior is Corinthian. All the monuments and altars were destroyed when the old church was demolished, except the high altar which is of alabaster, in the Gothic style, and was given early in the 15th century by D. Bernat Despujol. Among the chapels is that of St. Bernat Calvó (1233–43), who assisted James I of Aragon in the conquest of Valencia. A Gothic doorway leading to the chapter house has been preserved.

The conciliar seminary was begun in 1635 by Gaspar Gil and was finally finished, by command of Pope Benedict XIV, by Manuel Muñoz in 1748. The modern seminary is located in the former Jesuit College. It has sent out many famous men, among them Balmes and the poet Jacint Verdaguer, author of &quot;L&#x27;Atlàntida&quot;. The episcopal palace was destroyed in the wars of 1640 and rebuilt in stages, being completed by Bishop Veyan. The archaeological museum is in this building.

Manresa, where St. Ignatius Loyola wrote his Spiritual Exercises, is situated in the Diocese of Vic. His memory is venerated in the Santa Cova, which has been converted into a church, and a college of the Jesuits built near it.

== Demography ==
Vic has 20,000 registered voters.

==Miscellaneous==
The University of Vic never attained any great importance; it is not known when or by whom it was founded. King Philip II granted it the privilege of conferring degrees, but only in philosophy and the arts (1599). Philip V, in the Corts of Barcelona (1702), granted it the power to confer degrees in theology and other higher sciences.

The remains of Jaume Balmes, the Spanish philosopher of the 19th century, are interred in the cloister of the cathedral. His first centenary was celebrated at Vic by a Catholic Congress. Architect Antoni Gaudí (who lived in Vic for three weeks during May 1910) designed two basalt and wrought iron lampposts for the Plaça Major of Vic in honour of Balmes&#x27;s centenary. The lampposts were inaugurated on 7 September 1910 but destroyed in 1924.

Other natives of Vic include:
*Trinitarian Saint Michael de Sanctis
*Joseph Sadoc Alemany, (1814–1888), born in Vic, later Archbishop of San Francisco
*Caterina Coromina i Agustí (1824–1893), religious woman beatified in 2006

On 22 December 2005 some inhabitants of the city won a total prize of about 500 million euros in the Spanish Christmas Lottery.

==Sport==
The city has a football club, UE Vic, which was founded in 1922 and plays in the Lliga Elit, and a roller hockey team, CHP Vic, which plays in the OK Liga.

<text>Valls () is a city and municipality in the Camp de Tarragona region in Catalonia, Spain. It is the capital of the comarca of Alt Camp. In 2014, it had a population of 24,570.

Valls is known for its calçots – a type of scallion or green onion – and the human towers tradition known as the castells. The town is the birthplace of the composer Robert Gerhard (1896–1970).

==Geography==
Valls is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Alt Camp. With a population of 24,570 inhabitants in 2014, it represents more than half of the population of the county. It is located next to the River Francolí, near Reus (Baix Camp) and Tarragona (Tarragonès), the capital of the Spanish province.

==Culture==

Valls is known for its culinary tradition, the feasting on calçots at what is known as a &quot;calçotada&quot;. The calçots are a large type of sweet-flavoured spring onion, barbecued over a pit of flaming vines, and eaten piping hot with a sauce. The calçotada continues with a main course of meats and sausages grilled over the same glowing coals, and is washed down with locally produced wines. The calçots are only available between December and May and draw diners from as far away as Barcelona. The calçot is grown locally and has a &quot;PGI&quot; (Protected Geographical Indication) status in the same way that champagne does.

Another cultural tradition of Valls is the practice of building &quot;castells&quot; at festivals, towers of people sometimes as much as ten individuals high, with each layer being supported by the people below. This human tower tradition originated in the &quot;Ball dels Valencians&quot; in Valls, first recorded in 1712, and later spread to nearby towns such as Vilafranca del Penedès and Tarragona, and more recently, to other parts of Catalonia.

The composer Roberto Gerhard was born in Valls in 1896. He studied under Charles Koechlin in Paris and under Arnold Schoenberg in Vienna and Berlin before returning to Barcelona in 1928. During the Spanish Civil War he supported the Republican cause and was forced to flee the country in 1939, first to Paris and then to England where he spent the rest of his life, while his town was bombarded and a lot of Republican and Catholic citizens were killed. His works were virtually banned from performance in Spain under Francisco Franco. His output included symphonies, stage works, chamber music, choral music and electronic music.

In January 2017, Valls City Council announced the start of construction of a multimedia museum devoted to the culture of castells, called the Casteller Museum of Catalonia (&quot;Museu Casteller de Catalunya&quot;), marketed in English as &quot;The Human Towers Experience&quot;. The project was initially launched in 2015, and is supported by the Catalan government.

==Sport==
Football clubs Unió Esportiva Valls and Atlètic de Valls play in the town, as does CB Valls, a basketball club.

==Early life==
Nolte was born in Omaha, Nebraska on February 8, 1941. His father, Franklin Arthur Nolte (1904–1978), was a farmer&#x27;s son who ran away from home, nearly dropped out of high school and was a three-time letter winner in football at Iowa State University (1929–31). His mother, Helen (; 1914–2000), was a department store buyer, then became an antique dealer, co-owning an antique shop. His father was of German ancestry. Nolte&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Matthew Leander King, invented the hollow-tile silo and was involved in early aviation. His maternal grandmother ran the student union at Iowa State University. He has an older sister, Nancy, who was an executive for the Red Cross.

Nolte attended Kingsley Elementary School in Waterloo, Iowa. He studied at Westside High School in Omaha, where he was the kicker on the football team. He also attended Benson High School, but was expelled for hiding beer before practice and being caught drinking it during a practice session. Following his high school graduation in 1959, he attended Pasadena City College in Southern California, Arizona State University in Tempe (on a football scholarship), Eastern Arizona College in Thatcher and Phoenix College in Phoenix. At Eastern Arizona, he lettered in football as a tight end and defensive end, in basketball as a forward, and as a catcher on the baseball team. Poor grades eventually ended his studies, at which point his career in theatre began in earnest. While in college, he worked for the Falstaff Brewery in Omaha.

After stints at the Pasadena Playhouse and the Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles, Nolte spent several years traveling the country and working in regional theater, including the Old Log Theater in Minnesota for three years.

Nolte also made two guest appearances in the television series &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; in 1974 and 1975. He co-starred with Andy Griffith in &quot;Winter Kill&quot;, a television film made as the pilot of a possible television series, and another one, &quot;Adams of Eagle Lake&quot;, but neither was picked up.

He received his second Academy Award nomination in 1997 for &#x27;. Nolte starred with Sean Penn in three films, including Terrence Malick&#x27;s war epic &#x27;, &quot;U Turn&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

In 1992, Nolte was named the Sexiest Man Alive by &quot;People&quot; magazine. When asked about the selection he said &quot;Are you sure you didn&#x27;t make a mistake? My personal choice is Walter Cronkite.&quot;
Nolte continued to work in the 2000s, taking smaller parts in &#x27; and &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;, both performances receiving positive reviews. He also played supporting roles in the 2006 drama &quot;Peaceful Warrior&quot; and the 2008 comedy &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;. In 2011, Nolte played recovering alcoholic Paddy Conlon in &quot;Warrior&quot;, and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Beginning in 2011, Nolte starred with Dustin Hoffman in the HBO series &quot;Luck&quot;. At the start of production of the second season, however, HBO ended the series after the death of three horses during filming. In 2013, he was in the movie &#x27; which starred Jason Statham. In 2015, Nolte starred in the biopic comedy-drama &#x27; and in the revenge thriller &#x27;.

From 2016 to 2017, Nolte starred in &quot;Graves&quot; on Epix about a volatile, hard-drinking former U.S. president who has been retired for 25 years and who has a political epiphany to right the wrongs of his past administration in very public and unpredictable ways.

For Nolte, acting is not a career but something he needs to do, he says, &quot;a need in the sense that I can&#x27;t find anything as complex and interesting to do, but I need it in a story,&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do reality because reality never runs smooth&quot;. He likes to vanish into a role &quot;if the story reaches up to where the great actor is, the great actor disappears, and the story becomes number one, that&#x27;s as real as it gets&quot;. Nolte appeared as recurring character Kuiil in the Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; in 2019.

==Personal life==
Nolte married Clytie Lane in 2016. He was previously married to Sheila Page, Sharyn Haddad, and Rebecca Linger. Nolte and Linger have a son, Brawley (b. 1986), an actor who is married to Indian-American actress Navi Rawat. Nolte and Lane have a daughter, Sophia (b. 2007). Sophia played his granddaughter in &quot;&quot;. Nolte and Linger also had a daughter in 1983 who was stillborn. Nolte lived with Karen Eklund, who later sued him for palimony. He has also dated Debra Winger and Vicki Lewis.

===Legal troubles and substance abuse===
Nolte is known for his &quot;bad-boy reputation&quot;.

In 1961, he was arrested for selling counterfeit draft card documents and given a 45-year prison sentence and a $75,000 fine, but the sentence was suspended. However, the felony conviction left him ineligible for military service. He had felt obligated to serve in the Vietnam War, and says that he felt incomplete as a young man for not going to Vietnam.

On September 11, 2002, Nolte was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in Malibu, California. Tests later showed that he was under the influence of GHB. Nolte responded that he has &quot;been taking it for four years and I&#x27;ve never been raped.&quot; Three days later, he checked himself into Silver Hill Hospital in Connecticut for counseling. On December 12, 2002, he pleaded no contest to charges of driving under the influence. He was given three years&#x27; probation, with orders to undergo alcohol and drug counseling with random testing required.

In 2005, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that Nolte had struggled with substance abuse for &quot;the majority of his adult life&quot; and had begun abusing alcohol at an early age. After remaining sober for nearly 10 years, he resumed drinking in the late 1990s. Following his 2002 arrest, he again stopped drinking. In 2018, he told &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; that he did not have a drug problem and that he had been &quot;relatively clean outside of prescription stuff for years&quot;.

<doc id="84831" wikidata="Q12618" url="?curid=84831" title="Olot">
<text>Olot (; ) is the capital city of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Garrotxa, in the Province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. The city is known for its natural landscape, including four volcanoes scattered around the city center. The municipality is part of the Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa Natural Park. Olot is also well known for its cultural activity, with historical art movements like Olot school or factories of religious imagery, which contributed to the location in the city of the main Design and Arts &amp; Crafts school of the province of Girona, the Escola d&#x27;Art i Superior de Disseny d&#x27;Olot.

Between 1911 and 1969, Olot was linked to Girona by the narrow gauge Olot–Girona railway. The line has since been converted into a greenway.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of Olot is not clear and there are several hypotheses. According to the &quot;Crònica Universal de Catalunya&quot;, Olot was founded by Ulo, former king of the dynasty of Atlanteans, (then called Siculus), with the name of &quot;Ulot.&quot; Another theory, more widespread, is that the name comes from &quot;ala&quot; (wing in Catalan), because the city has been documented with the names &quot;Aulot&quot; and &quot;Alot&quot;. For this reason, the coat of arms of Olot has a wing in reference to the name of the city.

== Geography ==
The municipality 29,12 km2 and includes the city of Olot and the town of Batet de la Serra (annexed in 1971). The term is located at 443.4 meters above sea level and is approximately 50 km from Girona, the capital of the province of the same name. It is bordered by Sant Joan les Fonts (north east), Santa Pau (south east), Les Preses (south west), Riudaura (west) and La Vall de Bianya (north west).

The municipality consists of the original city of Olot and old towns and neighbourhoods that now form a conurbation around the city (Sant Roc d&#x27;Olot, Sant Cristòfol de les Fonts, Sant Andreu del Coll, Closells) apart from different urbanisations (les Fonts, Mas Bernat, les Planoles, etc.) and the old municipality of Batet de la Serra, which was independent until 1971.

==Geography and climate==
Olot is located on a plain surrounded by the mountain ranges of Valentí, Aiguanegra, the plateau of Batet, Marboleny and Sant Valentí de la Pinya. The plain is crossed by the Fluvià river and the Riudaura stream. There are four volcanoes in the city of Olot, called Montolivet, Montsacopa, Garrinada and Bisaroques.

The Fluvià discharges 1.07 m3/s into the Mediterranean Sea.

The area of Garrotxa is generally more humid than neighbouring regions. The annual rainfall is around 1000 mm. Popularly, it is said that &quot;if it isn&#x27;t raining in Olot, it isn&#x27;t raining anywhere&quot; (&quot;Si no plou a Olot, no plou enlloc&quot; in Catalan). The minimum in Olot in January is around 0 °C, and the maximum in August is around 28 °C.

== Population ==
== Main sights ==

The Montsacopa volcano is one of the main symbols of Olot. It has a cone of volcanic material and a circular crater. From above, a 360° panoramic of the city can be seen. The volcano also has a chapel on its top, dedicated to Saint Francis, and two watchtowers surrounding the crater. The old town, which grew up in the 9th century, has a rich cultural heritage, including the three-storied neo-classical cloister from the &quot;Hospici&quot; (charity building), the church of la Mare de Déu del Tura (patron of Olot), the Renaissance cloister of &quot;El Carme&quot; (which is a site of National Cultural Interest), and the Sant Esteve Parish Church, which was built in 1763 and it contains several artistic treasures, including an original El Greco (&quot;Christ carrying the Cross&quot;). Also in the old town there are examples of Art Nouveau architecture, like the Solà-Morales house.

Painting, sculpture and ceramics have been the key elements in the art of Olot, not to mention the tradition of the Nativity Scenes (&quot;pessebres&quot;), and the worldwide famous sculptures of saints. Also of importance is the School of Art, which was created in 1783 and nowadays it is the most important school of arts in the province of Girona (Escola d&#x27;Art i Superior de Disseny d&#x27;Olot). The artistic tradition of the city can be seen in several museums, being the Museu Comarcal de la Garrotxa the most relevant.
In Olot there are two important natural areas, the Moixina and the Parc Nou, which are characterized by their oak woods, which boast an understorey of plants that are extremely rare on the south side of the Pyrenees. These woods also inspired many of the painters from the &quot;Olot school&quot;. With the city being situated in the Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa Natural Park, the surrounding area also offers spectacular natural places like the &quot;Fageda d&#x27;en Jordà&quot; (a beech forest with volcanic blisters) or the natural springs of Sant Roc. The city also has a bicycle lane connecting to Girona, which was an old railway.

Main products of Olot&#x27;s local gastronomy are the sweet herbal liquor ratafia, the traditional cakes &quot;coca de llardons&quot; and &quot;tortell de matafaluga&quot;, the charcuterie from Olot, the Olot potatoes (wafers of potato stuffed with meat, covered in egg and flour, and then deep-fried), and the buckwheat flour. Some of the restaurants of the city have grouped together, offering the so-called &quot;volcanic cuisine&quot;.

<doc id="84839" wikidata="Q455232" url="?curid=84839" title="Jan Tschichold">
<text>Jan Tschichold (; born Johannes Tzschichhold; 2 April 1902 – 11 August 1974), also known as Iwan Tschichold or Ivan Tschichold, was a German calligrapher, typographer and book designer. He played a significant role in the development of graphic design in the 20th century – first, by developing and promoting principles of typographic modernism, and subsequently idealizing conservative typographic structures. His direction of the visual identity of Penguin Books in the decade following World War II served as a model for the burgeoning design practice of planning corporate identity programs. He also designed the typeface Sabon.

==Life==
Tschichold was the son of a provincial signwriter, and he was trained in calligraphy. In 1919, he began in the class of Hermann Delitzsch a study on the Leipziger Akademie der Künste (Leipzig Academy of the Arts). Due to his extraordinary achievements, he soon became a master pupil of the rector of Walter Tiemann, a type designer with the Gebr.-Klingspor foundry, and was given the task of teaching his fellow students. At the same time, he received the first orders as part of the Leipzig Trade Fair and in 1923 set up his own business as a typographic consultant to a print shop. 

This artisan background and calligraphic training set him apart from almost all other noted typographers of the time, since they had inevitably trained in architecture or the fine arts. It also may help explain why he never worked with handmade papers and custom typefaces as many typographers did, preferring instead to use stock faces on a careful choice from commercial paper stocks.

Although, up to this moment, he had only worked with historical and traditional typography, he radically changed his approach after his first visit to the Bauhaus exhibition at Weimar. After being introduced to important artists such as László Moholy-Nagy, El Lissitzky, Kurt Schwitters and others who were carrying out radical experiments to break the rigid schemes of conventional typography. He became sympathetic to this attempt to find new ways of expression and to reach a much more experimental way of working, but at the same time, felt it was important to find a simple and practical approach. 

He became one of the most important representatives of the &quot;new typography&quot; and in a special issue of &quot;Typographischen Mitteilungen&quot; (typographic communications) in 1925 with the title of &quot;Elementare Typografie&quot; (elementary typography), he summarized the new approaches in the form of theses.

After the election of Hitler in Germany, all designers had to register with the Ministry of Culture, and all teaching posts were threatened for anyone who was sympathetic to communism. Soon after Tschichold had taken up a teaching post in Munich at the behest of Paul Renner, they were both denounced as &quot;cultural Bolshevists&quot;. Ten days after the Nazis surged to power in March 1933, Tschichold and his wife were arrested. During the arrest, Soviet posters were found in his flat, casting him under suspicion of collaboration with communists. After six weeks a policeman somehow found him tickets for Switzerland, and he and his family managed to escape Nazi Germany in August 1933.

Apart from two longer stays in England in 1937 (at the invitation of the Penrose Annual), and 1947–1949 (at the invitation of Ruari McLean, the British typographer, with whom he worked on the design of Penguin Books), Tschichold lived in Switzerland for the rest of his life. He died in the hospital at Locarno in 1974.

==Design==

Tschichold had converted to Modernist design principles in 1923 after visiting the first Weimar Bauhaus exhibition. He became a leading advocate of Modernist design: first with an influential 1925 magazine supplement mentioned above); then a 1927 personal exhibition; then with his most noted work &quot;Die neue Typographie&quot;. This book was a manifesto of modern design, in which he condemned all typefaces but sans-serif (called &quot;Grotesk&quot; in Germany). He also favoured non-centered design (e.g., on title pages), and codified many other Modernist design rules. The idea of the New was the basis for the transformation of the entire system of printed graphics and graphic design. He advocated the use of standardised paper sizes for all printed matter, and made some of the first clear explanations of the effective use of different sizes and weights of type in order to quickly and easily convey information. This book was followed with a series of practical manuals on the principles of Modernist typography, which had a wide influence among ordinary workers and printers in Germany. Yet, despite his visits to England just before the war, only about four articles by Tschichold had been translated into English by 1945.

Although &quot;Die neue Typographie&quot; remains a classic, Tschichold slowly abandoned his rigid beliefs from around 1932 onwards (e.g. his Saskia typeface of 1932, and his acceptance of classical Roman typefaces for body-type) as he moved back towards Classicism in print design. He later condemned &quot;Die neue Typographie&quot; as too extreme. He also went so far as to condemn Modernist design in general as being authoritarian and inherently fascistic.

Between 1947 and 1949 Tschichold lived in England, where he oversaw the redesign of 500 paperbacks published by Penguin Books, leaving them with a standardized set of typographic rules, the &quot;Penguin Composition Rules&quot;. Although he gave Penguin&#x27;s books (particularly the Pelican range) a unified look and enforced many of the typographic practices that are taken for granted today, he allowed the nature of each work to dictate its look, with varied covers and title pages. In working for a firm that made inexpensive mass-market paperbacks, he was following a line of work — in cheap popular culture forms (e.g. film posters) — that he had always pursued during his career. He was succeeded at Penguin by Hans Schmoller.

His abandonment of Modernist principles meant that, even though he was living in Switzerland after the war, he was not at the centre of the post-war Swiss International Typographic Style. Unimpressed by the use of realist or neo-grotesque typefaces, which he saw as a revival of poorly designed models, his survey of typefaces in advertising deliberately made no mention of such designs, save for a reference to &#x27;survivals from the nineteenth-century which have recently enjoyed a short-lived popularity.&#x27;

==Typefaces==
Between 1926 and 1929, he designed a “universal alphabet” to clean up the few multigraphs and non-phonetic spellings in the German language. For example, he devised brand new characters to replace the multigraphs &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;sch&quot;. His intentions were to change the spelling by systematically replacing &quot;eu&quot; with &quot;oi&quot;, &quot;w&quot; with &quot;v&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; with &quot;ts&quot;. Long vowels were indicated by a macron below them, though the umlaut was still above. The alphabet was presented in one typeface, which was sans-serif and without capital letters.

Typefaces Tschichold designed include:
* Transit (1931) for &quot;Lettergieterij Amsterdam, voorheen Tetterode&quot;, 
* Saskia (1931/1932), for: Schelter &amp; Giesecke, Leipzig
* Zeus (1931) for: Schriftguss AG, Dresden
* Uhertype-Standard-Grotesk (1931), for an early phototypesetting machine. Essentially a modified Gill Sans.
* Sabon (1966/1967) .

Sabon was designed to be a typeface that would give the same reproduction on both Monotype and Linotype systems and there were also matrices made for type foundries. All type produced could be interchanged. It was used early after its release by Bradbury Thompson to set the Washburn College Bible. A “Sabon Next” was later released by Linotype as an ‘interpretation’ of Tschichold&#x27;s original Sabon.
