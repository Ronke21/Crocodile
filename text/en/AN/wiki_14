<text>The Jamestown settlement in the Colony of Virginia was the first permanent English settlement in the Americas. It was located on the northeast bank of the James River, about southwest of present-day Williamsburg. It was established by the London Company as &quot;James Fort&quot; on May 4, 1607 O.S. (May 14, 1607 N.S.), and considered permanent, after brief abandonment in 1610. It followed failed attempts, including the Roanoke Colony, established in 1585. Despite the dispatch of more supplies, only 60 of the original 214 settlers survived the 1609–1610 Starving Time. In mid-1610, the survivors abandoned Jamestown, though they returned after meeting a resupply convoy in the James River.

Jamestown served as the colonial capital from 1616 until 1699. In August 1619, the first recorded slaves from Africa to British North America arrived at present-day Old Point Comfort, near the Jamestown colony, on a British privateer ship flying a Dutch flag. The approximately 20 Africans from present-day Angola had been removed by the British crew from a Portuguese slave ship. They most likely worked in the tobacco fields, under a system of race-based indentured servitude. The modern conception of slavery in the British colonies was formalized in 1640, and fully entrenched in Virginia by 1660.

In 1676, Jamestown was deliberately burned during Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, though it was rebuilt. In 1699, the colonial capital was moved to present-day Williamsburg, Virginia. In the 18th century, Jamestown ceased to exist as a settlement and remains as an archaeological site, Jamestown Rediscovery, which houses museums and historical sites, including the Jamestown Settlement and the American Revolution Museum in Yorktown. Jamestown is one of three locations composing the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia, along with Williamsburg and Yorktown. is the archaeological site on Jamestown Island and is a cooperative effort by Jamestown National Historic Site and Preservation Virginia. Jamestown Settlement, a living history interpretive site, is operated by the Jamestown Yorktown Foundation, a state agency of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

==Settlement==
Spain, Portugal, and France moved quickly to establish a presence in the New World, while other European countries moved more slowly. The English did not attempt to found colonies until many decades after the explorations of John Cabot, and early efforts were failures—most notably the Roanoke Colony, which vanished about 1590.

===1607–1609: Arrival and beginning===

In 1606, English colonists set sail with a charter from the London Company to establish a colony in the New World. The fleet consisted of the ships &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, and &quot;Godspeed&quot;, all under the leadership of Captain Christopher Newport. They made a particularly long voyage of four months, including a stop in the Canary Islands, in Spain, and subsequently Puerto Rico, and finally departed for the American mainland on April 10, 1607.

The expedition made landfall on April 26, 1607, at a place which they named Cape Henry. Under orders to select a more secure location, they set about exploring what is now Hampton Roads and an outlet to the Chesapeake Bay which they named the James River in honor of King James I of England. Captain Edward Maria Wingfield was elected president of the governing council on April 25, 1607. On May 14, he selected a piece of land on a large peninsula some inland from the Atlantic Ocean as a prime location for a fortified settlement. The river channel was a defensible strategic point due to a curve in the river, and it was close to the land, making it navigable and offering enough land for piers or wharves to be built in the future. Perhaps the most favorable fact about the location was that it was uninhabited because the leaders of the nearby indigenous nations considered the site too poor and remote for agriculture. The island was swampy and isolated, and it offered limited space, was plagued by mosquitoes, and afforded only brackish tidal river water unsuitable for drinking.

The Jamestown settlers arrived in Virginia during a severe drought, according to a research study conducted by the Jamestown Archaeological Assessment (JAA) team in the 1990s. The JAA analyzed information from a study conducted in 1985 by David Stahle and others, who obtained drawings of 800-year-old bald cypress trees along the Nottoway and Blackwater rivers. The lifespan of these trees is up to 1,000 years, and their rings offer a good indication of an area&#x27;s annual amount of rainfall. The borings revealed that the worst drought in 700 years occurred between 1606 and 1612. This severe drought affected the Jamestown colonists and Powhatan tribe&#x27;s ability to produce food and obtain a safe supply of water.

The settlers also arrived too late in the year to get crops planted. Many in the group were either gentlemen or their manservants, both equally unaccustomed to the hard labor demanded by the harsh task of carving out a viable colony. One of these was Robert Hunt, a former vicar of Reculver, England, who celebrated the first known Anglican Eucharist in the territory of the future United States on June 21, 1607.

Two-thirds of the settlers died before ships arrived in 1608 with supplies and German and Polish craftsmen, who helped to establish the first manufactories in the colony. As a result, glassware became the foremost American products to be exported to Europe at the time. Clapboard had already been sent back to England beginning with the first returning ship.

The delivery of supplies in 1608 on the first and second supply missions of Captain Newport had also added to the number of hungry settlers. It seemed certain at that time that the colony at Jamestown would meet the same fate as earlier English attempts to settle in North America, specifically the Roanoke Colony (Lost Colony) and the Popham Colony, unless there was a major relief effort. The Germans who arrived with the second supply and a few others defected to the Powhatans, with weapons and equipment. The Germans even planned to join a rumored Spanish attack on the colony and urged the Powhatans to join it. The Spanish were driven off by the timely arrival in July 1609 of Captain Samuel Argall in &quot;Mary and John&quot;, a larger ship than the Spanish reconnaissance ship &quot;La Asunción de Cristo&quot;. Argall&#x27;s voyage also prevented the Spanish from gaining knowledge of the weakness of the colony. Don Pedro de Zúñiga, the Spanish ambassador to England, was desperately seeking this information (in addition to spies) in order to get Philip III of Spain to authorize an attack on the colony.

The investors of the Virginia Company of London expected to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the second supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon the leaders of Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay the cost of the voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony. It fell to the third president of the council, Captain John Smith, to deliver a bold and much-needed wake-up call in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen who could help make the colony more self-sufficient.

===1609–1610: Starving Time and third supply===

After Smith was forced to return to England because of an explosion which gave him deep burn wounds during a trading expedition, the colony was led by George Percy, who proved incompetent in negotiating with the native tribes. There are indications that those in London comprehended and embraced Smith&#x27;s message. The third supply mission of 1609 was by far the largest and best equipped. They also had a new purpose-built flagship, &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, constructed and placed in the most experienced of hands, Christopher Newport.

On June 2, 1609, &quot;Sea Venture&quot; set sail from Plymouth, England, as the flagship of a seven-ship fleet (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown as part of the third supply mission, carrying 214 settlers. On July 24, the fleet ran into a strong storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. Although some of the ships did make it to Jamestown, the leaders and most of the supplies had been aboard &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, which fought the storm for three days before the Admiral of the company, Sir George Somers, deliberately drove it onto the reefs of Bermuda to prevent its foundering. This allowed all aboard to be landed safely. The survivors (including Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, Captain Christopher Newport, Silvester Jourdain, Stephen Hopkins—later of &quot;Mayflower&quot;—and secretary William Strachey) were stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months. During that time, they built two new ships, the pinnaces &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;. The original plan was to build only one vessel, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, but it soon became evident that it would not be large enough to carry the settlers and all of the food (salted pork) that was being sourced on the islands.

While the third supply was stranded in Bermuda, the colony at Jamestown was in even worse shape. The settlers faced rampant starvation for want of additional provisions. During this time, lack of food drove people to eat snakes and even boil the leather from shoes for sustenance. Only 60 of the original 214 settlers at Jamestown survived. There is historical and scientific evidence that the settlers at Jamestown had turned to cannibalism during the starving time.

The ships from Bermuda arrived in Jamestown on May 23, 1610. Many of the surviving colonists were near death, and Jamestown was judged to be unviable. Everyone was boarded onto &quot;Deliverance&quot; and &quot;Patience&quot;, which set sail for England. However, on June 10, 1610, the timely arrival of another relief fleet, bearing Governor Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr (who would eventually give his name to the colony of Delaware), which met the two ships as they descended the James River, granted Jamestown a reprieve. The colonists called this &quot;The Day of Providence&quot;. The fleet brought supplies and additional settlers. All the settlers returned to the colony, though there was still a critical shortage of food.

Relations between the colonists and the Powhatans quickly deteriorated after De La Warr&#x27;s arrival, eventually leading to conflict. The Anglo-Powhatan War lasted until Samuel Argall captured Wahunsenacawh&#x27;s daughter Matoaka, better known by her nickname Pocahontas, after which the chief accepted a treaty of peace.

===1610–1624: Rising fortunes===

Due to the aristocratic backgrounds of many of the colonists, a historic drought and the communal nature of their workload, progress through the first few years was inconsistent. By 1613, six years after Jamestown&#x27;s founding, the organizers and shareholders of the Virginia Company were desperate to increase the efficiency and profitability of the struggling colony. Without stockholder consent the Governor, Sir Thomas Dale, assigned plots to its &quot;ancient planters&quot; and smaller plots to the settlement&#x27;s later arrivals. Measurable economic progress was made, and the settlers began expanding their planting to land belonging to local native tribes. That this turnaround coincided with the end of a drought that had begun the year before the English settlers&#x27; arrival probably indicates multiple factors were involved besides the colonists&#x27; ineptitude.

Among the colonists who survived the Starving Time was John Rolfe, who carried with him a cache of untested tobacco seeds from Bermuda, which had grown wild there after being planted by shipwrecked Spaniards years before. In 1614, Rolfe began to successfully harvest tobacco. Prosperous and wealthy, he married Pocahontas, bringing several years of peace between the English and natives. However, at the end of a public relations trip to England, Pocahontas became sick and died on March 21, 1617. The following year, her father also died. Powhatan&#x27;s brother, a fierce warrior named Opechancanough, became head of the Powhatan Confederacy. As the English continued to appropriate more land for tobacco farming, relations with the natives worsened.

Because of the high cost of the trans-Atlantic voyage at this time, many English settlers came to Jamestown as indentured servants: in exchange for the passage, room, board, and the promise of land or money, these immigrants would agree to work for three to seven years. Immigrants from continental Europe, mainly Germans, were usually redemptioners—they purchased some portion of their voyage on credit and, upon arrival, borrowed or entered into a work contract to pay the remainder of their voyage costs.

In 1619, the first representative assembly in America, the General Assembly, convened in the Jamestown Church, &quot;to establish one equal and uniform government over all Virginia&quot; which would provide &quot;just laws for the happy guiding and governing of the people there inhabiting.&quot; Initially, only men of English origin were permitted to vote. On June 30, 1619, in what was the first recorded strike in Colonial America, the Polish artisans protested and refused to work if not allowed to vote. On July 21, 1619, the court granted the Poles equal voting rights. Afterwards, the labor strike was ended, and the artisans resumed their work. Individual land ownership was also instituted, and the colony was divided into four large &quot;boroughs&quot; or &quot;incorporations&quot; called &quot;citties&quot; by the colonists. Jamestown was located in James Cittie.

Of the first documented African slaves to arrive in English North America, on the frigate &quot;White Lion&quot; in August 1619, were an African man and woman, later named Antoney and Isabella. Listed in the 1624 census in Virginia, they became the first African family recorded in Jamestown. Their baby, named William Tucker, became the first documented African child baptized in British North America. Another of the early enslaved Africans to be purchased at the settlement was Angela, who worked for Captain William Peirce.

After several years of strained coexistence, Chief Opechancanough and his Powhatan Confederacy attempted to eliminate the English colony once and for all. On the morning of March 22, 1622, they attacked outlying plantations and communities up and down the James River in what became known as the Indian massacre of 1622. More than 300 settlers were killed in the attack, about a third of the colony&#x27;s English-speaking population. Dale&#x27;s development at Henricus, which was to feature a college to educate the natives, and Wolstenholme Towne at Martin&#x27;s Hundred, were both essentially wiped out. Jamestown was spared only through a timely warning by a Virginia Indian employee. There was not enough time to spread the word to the outposts.

Of the 6,000 people who came to the settlement between 1608 and 1624, only 3,400 survived.

===1624–1699: Later years===
In 1624, King James revoked the Virginia Company&#x27;s charter, and Virginia became a royal colony. Despite the setbacks, the colony continued to grow. Ten years later, in 1634, by order of King Charles I, the colony was divided into the original eight shires of Virginia, in a fashion similar to that practiced in England. Jamestown was located in James City Shire, soon renamed the &quot;County of James City&quot;, better known in modern times as James City County, Virginia, the nation&#x27;s oldest county.

Another large-scale &quot;Indian attack&quot; occurred in 1644. In 1646 Opechancanough was captured, and while he was in custody an English guard shot him in the back—against orders—and killed him. Subsequently, the Powhatan Confederacy began to decline. Opechancanough&#x27;s successor signed the first peace treaties between the Powhatan Indians and the English. The treaties required the Powhatan to pay yearly tribute payment to the English and confined them to reservations.

A generation later, during Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion in 1676, Jamestown was burned and eventually rebuilt. During its recovery, the Virginia legislature met first at Governor William Berkeley&#x27;s nearby Green Spring Plantation, and later at Middle Plantation, which had been started in 1632 as a fortified community inland on the Virginia Peninsula, about distant. When the statehouse burned again in 1698, this time accidentally, the legislature again temporarily relocated to Middle Plantation and was able to meet in the new facilities of the College of William &amp; Mary, which had been established after receiving a royal charter in 1693. Rather than rebuilding at Jamestown again, the capital of the colony was moved permanently to Middle Plantation in 1699. The town was renamed Williamsburg, to honor the reigning monarch, King William III. A capitol building and &quot;Governor&#x27;s Palace&quot; were erected there in the following years.

==Aftermath and preservation==

After the move of the capital to Williamsburg, Jamestown declined. Those who lived in the general area attended services at Jamestown&#x27;s church until the 1750s, when it was abandoned. By the mid-18th century, the land was heavily cultivated, primarily by the Travis and Ambler families. In 1831, David Bullock purchased Jamestown from the Travis and Ambler families.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War, in 1861 Confederate William Allen, who owned the Jamestown Island, occupied Jamestown with troops he raised at his own expense with the intention of blockading the James River and Richmond from the Union Navy. He was joined by Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones, who directed the building of batteries and conducted ordnance and armor tests for the first Confederate ironclad warship, CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, which was under construction at the Gosport Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth in late 1861 and early 1862. Jamestown had a peak force of 1,200 men.

During the Peninsula campaign, which began later that spring, Union forces under General George B. McClellan moved up the peninsula from Fort Monroe in an attempt to capture the Confederate capital of Richmond. The Union forces captured Yorktown in April 1862, and the Battle of Williamsburg was fought the following month. With these developments, Jamestown and the lower James River were abandoned by the Confederates. Some of the forces from Jamestown and the crew of &quot;Virginia&quot; relocated to Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, a fortified and strategic position high above the river about below Richmond. There they successfully blocked the Union Navy from reaching the Confederate capital.

Once in Federal hands, Jamestown became a meeting place for runaway slaves, who burned the Ambler house, an 18th-century plantation house, which along with the old church was one of the few remaining signs of old Jamestown. When Allen sent men to assess the damage in late 1862, they were killed by the former slaves. Following the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, the oath of allegiance was administered to former Confederate soldiers at Jamestown.

===Preservation and early archaeology===
In the years after the Civil War, Jamestown became quiet and peaceful once again. In 1892, Jamestown was purchased by Edward Barney. The following year, Barney donated 22½ acres of land, including the ruined church tower, to the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, now known as Preservation Virginia. By this time, erosion from the river had eaten away the island&#x27;s western shore. Visitors began to conclude that the site of James Fort lay completely underwater. With federal assistance, a sea wall was constructed in 1900 to protect the area from further erosion. The archaeological remains of the original 1607 fort, which had been protected by the sea wall, were not discovered until 1996.

In 1932, George Craghead Gregory of Richmond was credited with discovering the foundation of the first brick statehouse (capitol) building, circa 1646, at Jamestown on the land owned by Preservation Virginia. Around 1936, Gregory, who was active with the Virginia Historical Society, founded the Jamestowne Society for descendants of stockholders in the Virginia Company of London and the descendants of those who owned land or who had domiciles in Jamestown or on Jamestown Island prior to 1700.

Colonial National Monument was authorized and established by the U.S. Congress in 1930. In 1934, the National Park Service obtained the remaining portion of Jamestown Island which had been under private ownership by the Vermillion family. The National Park Service partnered with Preservation Virginia to preserve the area and present it to visitors in an educational manner. On June 5, 1936, the national monument was re-designated a national historical park and became known as Colonial National Historical Park.

Beginning in 1936, J.C. Harrington worked on the NPS&#x27;s excavations at Jamestown. In 1954, John L. Cotter took charge of field projects at Jamestown, conducted with the site&#x27;s 350th anniversary (1957) in mind. Cotter worked with Edward B. Jelks and Harrington to survey the area&#x27;s colonial sites. In 1957 Cotter and J. Paul Hudson co-authored &quot;New Discoveries at Jamestown&quot;. Cotter contributed, along with Jelks, Georg Neumann, and Johnny Hack, to the 1958 report &quot;Archaeological Excavations at Jamestown&quot;.

In the present time, as part of the Colonial National Historical Park, the Jamestown Island area is home to two heritage tourism sites related to the original fort and town. Nearby, the Jamestown-Scotland Ferry service provides a link across the navigable portion of the James River for vehicles and affords passengers a view of Jamestown Island from the river.

In 1996, gained renewed importance when the Jamestown Rediscovery project began excavations in search of the original James Fort site, originally in preparation for the quadricentennial of Jamestown&#x27;s founding. The primary goal of the archaeological campaign was to locate archaeological remains of &quot;the first years of settlement at Jamestown, especially of the earliest fortified town; [and the] subsequent growth and development of the town&quot;.

Visitors to can view the site of the original 1607 James Fort, the 17th-century church tower and the site of the 17th-century town, as well as tour an archaeological museum called the Archaearium and view many of the close to two million artifacts found by Jamestown Rediscovery. They also may participate in living history ranger tours and archaeological tours given by the Jamestown Rediscovery staff. Visitors can also often observe archaeologists from the Jamestown Rediscovery Project at work, as archaeological work at the site continues. , the archaeological work and studies are ongoing. In addition to their newsletter and website, new discoveries are frequently reported in the local newspaper, the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; based in nearby Williamsburg, and by other news media, often worldwide.

===Jamestown Settlement===

Jamestown Settlement is a living-history park and museum located from the original location of the colony and adjacent to Jamestown Island. Initially created for the celebration of the 350th anniversary in 1957, Jamestown Settlement is operated by the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, and largely sponsored by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The museum complex features a reconstruction of a Powhatan village, the James Fort as it was –1614, and seagoing replicas of the three ships that brought the first settlers, &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;.

==Commemorations==
With the national independence of the United States established by the end of the 18th century, Jamestown came to be looked at as a starting point. Its founding in 1607 has been regularly commemorated, with the most notable events being held every fifty years.

===200th anniversary===
The of Jamestown on May 13–14, 1807, was called the Grand National Jubilee. Over 3,000 people attended the event, many arriving on vessels which anchored in the river off the island. May 13 was the opening day of the festival, which began with a procession which marched to the graveyard of the old church, where the attending bishop delivered the prayer. The procession then moved to the Travis mansion, where the celebrants dined and danced in the mansion that evening. Also during the festivities, students of the College of William &amp; Mary gave orations. An old barn on the island was used as a temporary theater, where a company of players from Norfolk performed. Attending were many dignitaries, politicians, and historians. The celebration concluded on May 14 with a dinner and toast at the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg.

===250th anniversary (1857)===
In 1857, the Jamestown society organized a celebration marking the 250th anniversary of Jamestown&#x27;s founding. According to the Richmond &quot;Enquirer&quot;, the site for the celebration was on on the spot where some of the colonists&#x27; houses were originally built. However, it is also speculated that the celebration was moved further east on the island closer to the Travis grave site, in order to avoid damaging Major William Allen&#x27;s corn fields.

The attendance was estimated at between 6,000 and 8,000 people. Sixteen large steam ships anchored offshore in the James River and were gaily decorated with streamers. Former US President John Tyler of nearby Sherwood Forest Plantation gave a 2½ hour speech, and there were military displays, a grand ball and fireworks.

===300th anniversary (1907): Jamestown Exposition===
The 100th anniversary of the Surrender at Yorktown in 1781 had generated a new interest in the historical significance of the colonial sites of the Peninsula. Williamsburg, a sleepy but populated town of shops and homes, was still celebrating Civil War events. However, as the new century dawned, thoughts turned to the upcoming 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown. The Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities (now known as Preservation Virginia) started the movement in 1900 by calling for a celebration honoring the establishment of the first permanent English colony in the New World at Jamestown to be held on the 300th anniversary in 1907.

As a celebration was planned, virtually no one thought that the actual isolated and long-abandoned original site of Jamestown would be suitable for a major event because Jamestown Island had no facilities for large crowds. The original fort housing the Jamestown settlers was believed to have been long ago swallowed by the James River. The general area in James City County near Jamestown was also considered unsuitable, as it was not very accessible in the day of rail travel before automobiles were common.

As the tricentennial of the 1607 Founding of the Jamestown neared, around 1904, despite an assumption in some quarters that Richmond would be a logical location, leaders in Norfolk began a campaign to have a celebration held there. The decision was made to locate the international exposition on a mile-long frontage at Sewell&#x27;s Point near the mouth of Hampton Roads. This was about downstream from Jamestown in a rural section of Norfolk County. It was a site which could become accessible by both long-distance passenger railroads and local streetcar service, with considerable frontage on the harbor of Hampton Roads. This latter feature proved ideal for the naval delegations which came from points all around the world.

The Jamestown Exposition of 1907 was one of the many world&#x27;s fairs and expositions that were popular in the early part of the 20th century. Held from April 26, 1907, to December 1, 1907, attendees included US President Theodore Roosevelt, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, the Prince of Sweden, Mark Twain, Henry H. Rogers, and dozens of other dignitaries and famous persons. A major naval review featuring the United States&#x27; Great White Fleet was a key feature. U.S. Military officials and leaders were impressed by the location, and the Exposition site later formed the first portion of the large U.S. Naval Station Norfolk in 1918 during World War I.

===350th Anniversary (1957): Jamestown Festival===

With America&#x27;s increased access to automobiles, and with improved roads and transportation, it was feasible for the 350th anniversary celebration to be held at Jamestown itself in 1957. Although erosion had cut off the land bridge between Jamestown Island and the mainland, the isthmus was restored and new access provided by the completion of the National Park Service&#x27;s Colonial Parkway which led to Williamsburg and Yorktown, the other two portions of Colonial Virginia&#x27;s Historic Triangle. There were also improvements of state highways. The north landing for the popular Jamestown Ferry and a portion of State Route 31 were relocated.

Major projects were developed by non-profit, state and federal agencies. Jamestown Festival Park was established by the Commonwealth of Virginia adjacent to the entrance to Jamestown Island. Full-sized replicas of the three ships that brought the colonists, &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, and &quot;Discovery&quot; were constructed at a shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia and placed on display at a new dock at Jamestown, where the largest, &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, could be boarded by visitors. On Jamestown Island, the reconstructed Jamestown Glasshouse, the Memorial Cross and the visitors center were completed and dedicated. A loop road was built around the island.

Special events included army and navy reviews, air force fly-overs, ship and aircraft christenings and even an outdoor drama at Cape Henry, site of the first landing of the settlers. This celebration continued from April 1 to November 30 with over a million participants, including dignitaries and politicians such as the British Ambassador and U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon. The highlight for many of the nearly 25,000 at the Festival Park on October 16, 1957, was the visit and speech of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and her consort, Prince Philip. Queen Elizabeth II loaned a copy of Magna Carta for the exhibition. It was her first visit to the United States since ascending the throne.

The 1957 Jamestown Festival was so successful that tourists still kept coming long after the official event was completed. Jamestown became a permanent attraction of the Historic Triangle, and has been visited by families, school groups, tours, and thousands of other people continuously ever since.
===400th anniversary: Jamestown 2007===
Early in the 21st century, new accommodations, transportation facilities and attractions were planned in preparation for the quadricentennial of the founding of Jamestown. Numerous events were promoted under the banner of America&#x27;s 400th Anniversary and promoted by the Jamestown 2007 Commission. The commemoration included 18 months of statewide, national and international festivities and events, which began in April 2006 with a tour of the new replica &quot;Godspeed&quot;.

In January 2007, the Virginia General Assembly held a session at Jamestown. On May 4, 2007, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip attended a ceremony commemorating the 400th anniversary of the settlement&#x27;s arrivals, reprising the honor they paid in 1957.

In addition to the Virginia State Quarter, Jamestown was also the subject of two United States commemorative coins celebrating the 400th anniversary of its settlement. A silver dollar and a gold five dollar coin were issued in 2007.

=== 2019 Commemoration ===
In 2019 Jamestown, in cooperation with Williamsburg, held a commemoration that marked the 400th anniversary of three landmark events in American history: the first meeting of the General Assembly, the arrival of the first Africans to English North America, and the first Thanksgiving.

==In popular culture==
* A fictional romantic adventure set at Jamestown, &quot;To Have and to Hold&quot;, was the bestselling novel in the United States in 1900. The novel was later adapted into two feature films, in 1916 and 1922.
* A highly fictionalized version of the Jamestown settlement is depicted in the animated Disney film &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995) as well as its direct-to-video sequel &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot; (1998). Among other inaccuracies it is shown as being near mountains, when it was actually located on the Tidewater region.
* A feature-length film, &quot;The New World&quot; (2005), directed by Terrence Malick, covers the story of Jamestown&#x27;s colonization. Although the historical details are accurate in most ways, the plot focuses on a dramatized relationship between John Smith, played by Colin Farrell, and Pocahontas, played by Q&#x27;orianka Kilcher. It also features John Rolfe, played by Christian Bale. Many scenes were filmed on-location along the James and Chickahominy Rivers and at Henricus Historical Park in Chesterfield County, Virginia.

<doc id="75807" wikidata="Q363948" url="?curid=75807" title="Contradiction">
<text>In traditional logic, a contradiction occurs when a proposition conflicts either with itself or established fact. It is often used as a tool to detect disingenuous beliefs and bias. Illustrating a general tendency in applied logic, Aristotle&#x27;s law of noncontradiction states that &quot;It is impossible that the same thing can at the same time both belong and not belong to the same object and in the same respect.&quot;

In modern formal logic and type theory, the term is mainly used instead for a &quot;single&quot; proposition, often denoted by the falsum symbol formula_1; a proposition is a contradiction if false can be derived from it, using the rules of the logic. It is a proposition that is unconditionally false (i.e., a self-contradictory proposition). This can be generalized to a collection of propositions, which is then said to &quot;contain&quot; a contradiction.

==History==
By creation of a paradox, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Euthydemus&quot; dialogue demonstrates the need for the notion of &quot;contradiction&quot;. In the ensuing dialogue, Dionysodorus denies the existence of &quot;contradiction&quot;, all the while that Socrates is contradicting him:

Indeed, Dionysodorus agrees that &quot;there is no such thing as false opinion ... there is no such thing as ignorance&quot;, and demands of Socrates to &quot;Refute me.&quot; Socrates responds &quot;But how can I refute you, if, as you say, to tell a falsehood is impossible?&quot;.

== In formal logic ==
In classical logic, particularly in propositional and first-order logic, a proposition formula_2 is a contradiction if and only if formula_3. Since for contradictory formula_2 it is true that formula_5 for all formula_6 (because formula_7), one may prove any proposition from a set of axioms which contains contradictions. This is called the &quot;principle of explosion&quot;, or &quot;ex falso quodlibet&quot; (&quot;from falsity, anything follows&quot;).

In a complete logic, a formula is contradictory if and only if it is unsatisfiable.

===Proof by contradiction===

For a set of consistent premises formula_8 and a proposition formula_2, it is true in classical logic that formula_10 (i.e., formula_8 proves formula_2) if and only if formula_13 (i.e., formula_8 and formula_15 leads to a contradiction). Therefore, a proof that formula_13 also proves that formula_2 is true under the premises formula_8. The use of this fact forms the basis of a proof technique called proof by contradiction, which mathematicians use extensively to establish the validity of a wide range of theorems. This applies only in a logic where the law of excluded middle formula_19 is accepted as an axiom.

Using minimal logic, a logic with similar axioms to classical logic but without &quot;ex falso quodlibet&quot; and proof by contradiction, we can investigate the axiomatic strength and properties of various rules that treat contradiction by considering theorems of classical logic that are not theorems of minimal logic. Each of these extensions leads to an intermediate logic:
# Double-negation elimination (DNE) is the strongest principle, axiomatized formula_20, and when it is added to minimal logic yields classical logic.
# Ex falso quodlibet (EFQ), axiomatized formula_21, licenses many consequences of negations, but typically does not help to infer propositions that do not involve absurdity from consistent propositions that do. When added to minimal logic, EFQ yields intuitionistic logic. EFQ is equivalent to &quot;ex contradiction quodlibet&quot;, axiomatized formula_22, over minimal logic.
# Peirce&#x27;s rule (PR) is an axiom formula_23 that captures proof by contradiction without explicitly referring to absurdity. Minimal logic + PR + EFQ yields classical logic. 
# The Gödel-Dummett (GD) axiom formula_24, whose most simple reading is that there is a linear order on truth values. Minimal logic + GD yields Gödel-Dummett logic. Peirce&#x27;s rule entails but is not entailed by GD over minimal logic.
# Law of the excluded middle (LEM), axiomatised formula_25, is the most often cited formulation of the principle of bivalence, but in the absence of EFQ it does not yield full classical logic. Minimal logic + LEM + EFQ yields classical logic. PR entails but is not entailed by LEM in minimal logic. If the formula B in Peirce&#x27;s rule is restricted to absurdity, giving the axiom schema formula_26, the scheme is equivalent to LEM over minimal logic.
# Weak law of the excluded middle (WLEM) is axiomatised formula_27 and yields a system where disjunction behaves more like in classical logic than intuitionistic logic, i.e. the disjunction and existence properties don&#x27;t hold, but where use of non-intuitionistic reasoning is marked by occurrences of double-negation in the conclusion. LEM entails but is not entailed by WLEM in minimal logic. WLEM is equivalent to the instance of De Morgan&#x27;s law that distributes negation over conjunction: formula_28.

===Symbolic representation===
In mathematics, the symbol used to represent a contradiction within a proof varies. Some symbols that may be used to represent a contradiction include ↯, Opq, formula_29, ⊥, formula_30/ , and ※; in any symbolism, a contradiction may be substituted for the truth value &quot;false&quot;, as symbolized, for instance, by &quot;0&quot; (as is common in Boolean algebra). It is not uncommon to see Q.E.D., or some of its variants, immediately after a contradiction symbol. In fact, this often occurs in a proof by contradiction to indicate that the original assumption was proved false—and hence that its negation must be true.

=== The notion of contradiction in an axiomatic system and a proof of its consistency ===
In general, a consistency proof requires the following two things:

# An axiomatic system
# A demonstration that it is &quot;not&quot; the case that both the formula &quot;p&quot; and its negation &quot;~p&quot; can be derived in the system.

But by whatever method one goes about it, all consistency proofs would &quot;seem&quot; to necessitate the primitive notion of &quot;contradiction.&quot; Moreover, it &quot;seems&quot; as if this notion would simultaneously have to be &quot;outside&quot; the formal system in the definition of tautology.

When Emil Post, in his 1921 &quot;Introduction to a General Theory of Elementary Propositions&quot;, extended his proof of the consistency of the propositional calculus (i.e. the logic) beyond that of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (PM), he observed that with respect to a &quot;generalized&quot; set of postulates (i.e. axioms), he would no longer be able to automatically invoke the notion of &quot;contradiction&quot;such a notion might not be contained in the postulates:

Post&#x27;s solution to the problem is described in the demonstration &quot;An Example of a Successful Absolute Proof of Consistency&quot;, offered by Ernest Nagel and James R. Newman in their 1958 &quot;Gödel&#x27;s Proof&quot;. They too observed a problem with respect to the notion of &quot;contradiction&quot; with its usual &quot;truth values&quot; of &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;falsity&quot;. They observed that:

Given some &quot;primitive formulas&quot; such as PM&#x27;s primitives S1 V S2 [inclusive OR] and ~S (negation), one is forced to define the axioms in terms of these primitive notions. In a thorough manner, Post demonstrates in PM, and defines (as do Nagel and Newman, see below) that the property of &quot;tautologous&quot; – as yet to be defined – is &quot;inherited&quot;: if one begins with a set of tautologous axioms (postulates) and a deduction system that contains substitution and modus ponens, then a &quot;consistent&quot; system will yield only tautologous formulas.

On the topic of the definition of &quot;tautologous&quot;, Nagel and Newman create two mutually exclusive and exhaustive classes K1 and K2, into which fall (the outcome of) the axioms when their variables (e.g. S1 and S2 are assigned from these classes). This also applies to the primitive formulas. For example: &quot;A formula having the form S1 V S2 is placed into class K2, if both S1 and S2 are in K2; otherwise it is placed in K1&quot;, and &quot;A formula having the form ~S is placed in K2, if S is in K1; otherwise it is placed in K1&quot;.

Hence Nagel and Newman can now define the notion of &quot;tautologous&quot;: &quot;a formula is a tautology if and only if it falls in the class K1, no matter in which of the two classes its elements are placed&quot;. This way, the property of &quot;being tautologous&quot; is described—without reference to a model or an interpretation.

Post observed that, if the system were inconsistent, a deduction in it (that is, the last formula in a sequence of formulas derived from the tautologies) could ultimately yield S itself. As an assignment to variable S can come from either class K1 or K2, the deduction violates the inheritance characteristic of tautology (i.e., the derivation must yield an evaluation of a formula that will fall into class K1). From this, Post was able to derive the following definition of inconsistency—&quot;without the use of the notion of contradiction&quot;:

In other words, the notion of &quot;contradiction&quot; can be dispensed when constructing a proof of consistency; what replaces it is the notion of &quot;mutually exclusive and exhaustive&quot; classes. An axiomatic system need not include the notion of &quot;contradiction&quot;.

== Philosophy ==
Adherents of the epistemological theory of coherentism typically claim that as a necessary condition of the justification of a belief, that belief must form a part of a logically non-contradictory system of beliefs. Some dialetheists, including Graham Priest, have argued that coherence may not require consistency.

===Pragmatic contradictions===
A pragmatic contradiction occurs when the very statement of the argument contradicts the claims it purports. An inconsistency arises, in this case, because the act of utterance, rather than the content of what is said, undermines its conclusion.

===Dialectical materialism===

In dialectical materialism: Contradiction—as derived from Hegelianism—usually refers to an opposition inherently existing within one realm, one unified force or object. This contradiction, as opposed to metaphysical thinking, is not an objectively impossible thing, because these contradicting forces exist in objective reality, not cancelling each other out, but actually defining each other&#x27;s existence. According to Marxist theory, such a contradiction can be found, for example, in the fact that:

* (a) enormous wealth and productive powers coexist alongside:
* (b) extreme poverty and misery;
* (c) the existence of (a) being contrary to the existence of (b).
Hegelian and Marxist theories stipulate that the dialectic nature of history will lead to the sublation, or synthesis, of its contradictions. Marx therefore postulated that history would logically make capitalism evolve into a socialist society where the means of production would equally serve the working and producing class of society, thus resolving the prior contradiction between (a) and (b).

==Outside formal logic==
Colloquial usage can label actions or statements as contradicting each other when due (or perceived as due) to presuppositions which are contradictory in the logical sense.

Proof by contradiction is used in mathematics to construct proofs.

The scientific method uses contradiction to falsify bad theory.

<text>Krypton is a fictional planet appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, most commonly appearing or mentioned in stories starring the superhero Superman as the world from where he came. The planet was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and was named after the chemical element krypton. The planet was first mentioned in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (June 1938) and made its first appearance in &quot;Superman&quot; #1 (1939).

Krypton is also the homeworld of Supergirl, Krypto the Superdog, Beppo the Super-Monkey, Power Girl (in her case, an alternate-universe version designated &quot;Krypton-Two&quot;), and the supervillain General Zod. It has been consistently described as having been destroyed shortly after Superman&#x27;s escape from the planet, although the exact details of its destruction vary by time period and writers. Kryptonians were the dominant species on Krypton.

Krypton also makes an appearance in several television series such as &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot;, and &quot;Krypton&quot;. Krypton appears in the 1978 film &quot;Superman&quot;, the 2006 film &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, and the 2013 film &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, set in the DC Extended Universe.

==Overview==
Krypton is usually portrayed in comics as the home of a fantastically advanced civilization, which is destroyed when the planet explodes. As originally depicted, all the civilizations and races of Krypton perished in the explosion, with one exception: the baby Kal-El who was placed in an escape rocket by his father, Jor-El, and sent to the planet Earth, where he grew up to become Superman.
In some versions of the story, additional survivors were later discovered, such as Supergirl, her parents (kept alive in the &quot;Survival Zone&quot;, a similar parallel &quot;dimension&quot; to the Phantom Zone), the criminal inhabitants of the Phantom Zone, Dev-Em, the residents of the bottled city of Kandor, the real parents of both Superman and Supergirl, and their pets Krypto the Superdog, and Beppo the Super-Monkey. Kandor, the first capital of Krypton, is miniaturized by Brainiac, but is eventually recovered by Superman and subsequently housed in the Fortress of Solitude for safekeeping. Soon afterward, Kryptonopolis becomes the second capital of Krypton.

From the late 1980s through the early 2000s, the number of survivors was reduced to Superman himself in the comic book stories (the Eradicator was added in 1989 as a non-sentient device, and shown to be self-aware in 1991), but more recent accounts have restored Supergirl, Krypto, and Kandor and introduced another newly discovered survivor, Karsta Wor-Ul.

Kryptonian civilization&#x27;s reported level of technological advancement has also varied. Some works, such as Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Last Days of Krypton&quot;, describe it as a few centuries ahead of Earth, while others, such as the &quot;Superman&quot; film series and &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, describe it as thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years more advanced.

==Versions of Krypton==
===Krypton in the Golden Age of Comic Books===
====History====
In its first appearance, Krypton was only depicted at the moment of its destruction. Beginning in the &quot;Superman&quot; comic strip, Krypton was shown to have been a planet similar to Earth, only older by eons and possessed of all the progress that implied. It is suggested that Krypton exploded due mainly to old age and the massive use of electricity Kryptonians used for their technology.

The debut of the &quot;Superman&quot; newspaper comic strip in 1939 delved into further details about Krypton, introducing the idea that all Kryptonians possessed a level of heightened physical abilities, including super-strength and super-speed. In the early comics&#x27; version of Krypton, Superman&#x27;s parents were named &quot;Jor-L&quot; and &quot;Lora&quot;, though their names were changed to the more familiar &quot;Jor-El&quot; and &quot;Lara&quot; by the end of the 1940s.

The Golden Age Krypton would be revised into another form almost as soon as it was defined, and very few stories were initially written about it. After the introduction of DC&#x27;s multiverse in the 1960s, this version of Krypton was declared to be the Krypton of the Earth-Two universe; the native dimension of DC&#x27;s Golden Age characters and its Superman.

After the emergence of Earth-Two as a differentiated alternate universe within the DC Multiverse, Power Girl (Kara Zor-El) was introduced as Krypton-Two&#x27;s alternate Supergirl in 1976. Kal-El and Kara Zor-El were the only known survivors of Krypton-Two, unlike the Silver Age analogue. Earth-Two&#x27;s universe lacked its own Brainiac, so its Kandor was never abducted from Krypton Two before its destruction, nor did Kal-El have his own version of Krypton as an infant and toddler on this world.

In the Golden Age, Superman was initially unaware of his true origins; in &quot;Superman&quot; #61, Superman discovered the existence of Krypton for the first time and learned of his Kryptonian heritage. He later encountered other survivors prior to Kara&#x27;s arrival in the form of three criminals, U-Ban, Kizo, and Mala, who were exiled by Superman&#x27;s father before Krypton&#x27;s destruction.

====Krypton in transition====
Over the course of the 1940s and 1950s, various alterations and additions to the makeup of Krypton were made in the comics. Among them was an explanation of why the natives of Krypton perished if they had possessed superpowers on their native world (as was the case in the earliest versions of Krypton outlined above, although this only became a problem once Superman — and by extension anyone from Krypton — was portrayed as increasingly powerful, able to withstand nuclear explosions, contrasted with his original power level in which a bursting mortar shell could penetrate his skin).

Thus, it was explained by the early 1950s that Kryptonians were powerless on their own planet and would gain superpowers only within a lower gravity environment. This matched the correct theories being published that humans who traveled to the moon would be able to lift greater masses and leap greater distances than on Earth due to the lesser gravity. In the early 1960s, added to this was the need to be exposed to the rays of a yellow sun (versus Krypton&#x27;s red sun, Rao, which was older and cooler, or put out less energy) to gain superpowers, with the yellow sun aspect soon gaining the much greater emphasis. Other changes to the concept of Krypton and its culture were introduced, many of which were stylistic.

===Krypton in the Silver Age of Comic Books===
By the late 1950s, Krypton played an increasing role in various &quot;Superman&quot; stories, with greater detail provided about Krypton&#x27;s makeup. Superman&#x27;s Kryptonian heritage was a frequent factor in Silver Age &quot;Superman&quot; comic storylines, as he was fully aware of his origins from an early age. Superman would use this knowledge for such tasks as constructing advanced Kryptonian technology or observing some of Krypton&#x27;s traditions.

====History====

Kryptonians made use of their advanced science to create a world where scientific inventions and research influenced much of daily life. Robots and computers were used for many tasks on Krypton, even for determining what career paths young Kryptonians would take as they grew up. Scientific and technological research were highly valued on Krypton, with the ruling body of Krypton named the &quot;Science Council&quot;.

Several stories featured characters traveling back in time to visit Krypton before its destruction; one example is the 1960 story &quot;Superman&#x27;s Return to Krypton&quot;, in which Superman is swept back in time to Krypton some years before its destruction. Powerless, he spends some time on the planet, where he meets his future parents-to-be and falls in love with a Kryptonian actress named Lyla Lerrol. A &quot;Superman&quot; &quot;imaginary story&quot; entitled &quot;What If Krypton Had Not Exploded?&quot; (reprinted in the trade paperback &quot;The Greatest Superman Stories Ever Told&quot;) gave more insight into Krypton&#x27;s society. This era also established that the Guardians of the Universe, the administrators of the interstellar police force, the Green Lantern Corps, were themselves aware of Krypton&#x27;s pending destruction and assigned Green Lantern Tomar-Re to avert it, but he was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempt.

In 1980, a three-issue miniseries titled &quot;World of Krypton&quot; was published, providing a great amount of detail into Krypton&#x27;s history just before its destruction, along with the life story of Jor-El himself. A three-issue miniseries entitled &quot;The Krypton Chronicles&quot;, published in 1981, tells of Superman researching his roots when, as Clark Kent, he was assigned to write an article about Superman&#x27;s family by an assignment editor impressed with the television miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;. To do so, he and Supergirl travel to Kandor, where they learn the history of the El family. In 1985, writer Alan Moore gave a somewhat darker glimpse into the world of Krypton in his story &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot; (in &quot;Superman Annual&quot; #11), the premise being an elaborate dream of Superman&#x27;s in which Krypton had not exploded and he had grown to adulthood there. Background details are culled from other Krypton stories. This same story was retold in the animated series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; in an episode by the same name and several elements were used in the &quot;Supergirl&quot; series episode &quot;For the Girl Who Has Everything&quot;. The story was also an inspiration for &quot;Krypton&quot; episode &quot;Mercy&quot;.

====Flora and fauna====
Krypton has a vast number of flora and fauna, both wild and domesticated. Some of them look very similar to Earth&#x27;s animals, due to parallel evolution, e.g., birds, felids, canids, simians, etc., as seen in Krypto and Beppo; while others look very different, due to divergent evolution, e.g., fish/snake/eel-like hybrid creatures called &quot;&quot;fish-snakes&quot;, goat-like creatures called &quot;Zuurt&quot;, bovine-like creatures called &quot;Rondor&quot;, rhino/ceratopsian-like hybrid creatures called &quot;Thought-Beasts&quot;, dragon-like creatures called &quot;H&#x27;Raka&quot;, gigantic, one-horned snake-like creatures called &quot;Drang&quot;, and jellyfish-like invertebrate creatures called &quot;Shoggoth&quot;&quot;.

====Moons====
One of Krypton&#x27;s moons, Wegthor, was accidentally destroyed by the Kryptonian scientist Jax-Ur, who was experimenting with a nuclear missile that was diverted from its intended destination. The disaster killed 500 inhabitants of the moon and Jax-Ur became the first and only criminal to be banished eternally to the Phantom Zone. This disaster also prompted the Science Council of Krypton to ban space flight completely.

====Survivors====
A Silver Age Superman was not alone in the survival of Krypton&#x27;s destruction, being joined by his cousin Supergirl, the Phantom Zone criminals, Krypto the Superdog, Beppo the Super-Monkey, a juvenile delinquent named Dev-Em, the entire population of the city of Kandor, Supergirl&#x27;s biological parents, and even Superman&#x27;s biological parents (in hibernation on a space ship - &quot;Superboy&quot; #158 (July 1969)), although it was discovered that they actually died from lethal radiation. When the planet exploded, one entire city of Krypton, Argo City, survived the cataclysm.

Argo City drifted through space on an asteroid-sized fragment of Krypton, which had been transformed into kryptonite by the explosion. The super-advanced technology of its Kryptonian inhabitants allowed them to construct a life-sustaining dome and a lead shield that protected their city from the kryptonite radiation of the asteroid. The protective shield was destroyed in a meteor storm, exposing the inhabitants to the deadly radiation.

The sole survivor of Argo City, Kara Zor-El, was sent to Earth by her scientist father to live with her cousin Kal-El, who had become known as Superman. Kara adjusted to her new life on Earth and became known as Supergirl. It was later discovered that Supergirl&#x27;s parents had survived in the Survival Zone, a parallel dimension similar to the Phantom Zone, from which she released them. When the bottle city of Kandor was finally enlarged on a new planet that was similar to Krypton, Supergirl&#x27;s parents joined its inhabitants to live there.

====Daxamites====
The people now known as the Daxamites were originally Kryptonians who left their homeworld to explore the universe. In post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity, the Eradicator, an artificial lifeform programmed to preserve all Kryptonian culture, altered the birthing matrices (&quot;artificial wombs&quot;) that the explorers took with them so that all newborns would be fatally vulnerable to lead and other materials such as greenhouse gases and certain rocks. Thus, if they persisted in their anti-Kryptonian wanderlust, they would all die from it. One Daxamite, Mon-El, was poisoned by lead and preserved in the Phantom Zone until Brainiac 5 found a cure in the 30th century, whereafter Mon-El became a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

====Vathlo Island====

Vathlo Island is a fictional location on Krypton, notable as an early attempt to explain in-universe the seeming non-presence of black people throughout the universe. Other scholars have called Vathlo Island out more broadly as a stand-in for different non-white diaspora communities, such Hispanic and Latino Americans.

In issue #234 of &quot;Superman&quot; (February 1971), the first apparently dark-skinned Kryptonian was featured, and described as being employed at &quot;Vathlo Station&quot;, but the origin of this previously unseen Kryptonian ethnicity otherwise went uncommented on.

Half a year later, in &quot;Superman&quot; #239 (June 1971), a panel drawn by artist Sal Amendola described a &quot;Vathlo Island&quot; in the &quot;Old World&quot; hemisphere of Krypton as being populated by a &quot;highly developed black race&quot;.

DC generally lagged behind its competitor Marvel Comics, and Superman comics generally more so than other DC titles, in depicting characters of color, and there were few previous appearances of black characters in the series, mostly stereotypical &quot;natives&quot;. It is unknown who exactly was responsible for introducing these first nonwhite races to Krypton&#x27;s demographic makeup, but Mark Waid has speculated that it was E. Nelson Bridwell, editorial assistant on the Superman books at the time. The commentary on the Vathlorians being &quot;highly developed&quot; (as if it were peculiar and noteworthy that people with dark skin might be developed) is generally seen by modern commentators as being well-intended but &quot;cringeworthy&quot;.

Other commentators have noted that the creation of Vathlo Island inspired a whole host of other questions, such as &#x27;If there are black Kryptonians, why are they so seldom seen, and why do they appear to live only on one island?&#x27; &quot;Gizmodo&quot; noted that a Krypton structured this way seems &quot;segregated as hell&quot;, while Gene Demby observed that this was an example of &quot;segregation in everything&quot;. DC Comics writer Mark Waid called this an &quot;error of omission&quot; coming from DC&#x27;s desire to represent people of darker skin as living on Krypton, but implementing this in a way with unintended implications. However, other writers have pointed out that DC would go on to re-use this as a rationale to explain the non-presence of black skinned characters in other contexts, as with the Tyroc character.

Vathlo was rarely if ever referenced beyond these few issues, although a black Kryptonian named &quot;Iph-Ro of Vathlo&quot; appeared in the more recent &quot;&quot; #111. An offhand reference to the island was made in Alan Moore&#x27;s story &quot;For the Man Who Has Everything&quot;, where &quot;racial trouble with the Vathlo Island immigrants&quot; are mentioned in a dream-world Krypton that had avoided destruction. It is believed, based on the appearances of black Kryptonians in recent Superman issues, that the Vathlonians eventually were integrated into Krypton proper, although there has been no canonical statement about this from DC Comics.

In &quot;&quot; #4, it is established that Vathlo Islanders settled in Kandor prior to the destruction of Krypton.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7 a black version of Superman is shown to reside on the alternate universe of Earth-23. This Superman, whose given name is Kalel but adopts the human alias of Calvin Ellis, is shown to originate from Vathlo Island of his reality&#x27;s Krypton.

While the island itself did not appear and was not referenced in the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, African-looking/dark-skinned Kryptonians have been featured. One was a disciple of Zod, who goes by the name Nam-Ek (portrayed by Leonard Roberts). Another was named Basqat (played by Adrian Holmes).

Dark-skinned Kryptonians have also appeared in the SyFy television series &quot;Krypton&quot;, including Lyta-Zod, one of the series&#x27; main characters, and General Zod himself. In this version, Vathlo Island is not mentioned.

Characters in Eric Jerome Dickey&#x27;s novel &quot;The Son of Mr. Suleman&quot; discuss Vathlo Island and react with derision to the idea that there was segregation on Krypton.

====&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;====
After the 1985 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Silver Age version of Krypton was replaced by a newer version. The Silver Age Krypton made a rare Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance in &quot;The Sandman&quot; #48, during a flashback sequence.

===Krypton in the Modern Age of Comic Books===
====&quot;The Man of Steel&quot;====
Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, which rebooted the history of the DC Universe and retroactively eliminated the existence of the Golden and Silver Age versions of Krypton, writer/artist John Byrne was given the task of recreating the entire &quot;Superman&quot; mythos. This rewrite was started in the 1986 &quot;Man of Steel&quot; miniseries, which addressed Krypton in both its opening and closing chapters.

Krypton itself was the main subject of the late 1980s &quot;The World of Krypton&quot; miniseries (not to be confused with the 1979 miniseries of the same name). This miniseries was written by Byrne and illustrated by Mike Mignola, and filled in much of Krypton&#x27;s new history.

====History====
The new Krypton was approximately one-and-a-half times larger than the Earth and orbited a red sun called Rao fifty light-years from the Solar System. Krypton&#x27;s primordial era produced some of the most dangerous organisms in the universe. It was for this reason that 250,000 years ago, Krypton was chosen as the place to create Doomsday through forced evolution. Until its destruction, many dangerous animals, including ferrophage moles, still existed on Krypton. Kryptonians had to use their advanced technology to survive.

Over 200,000 years ago, Krypton had developed scientific advancements far beyond those of present-day Earth, and had discovered a way to conquer disease and aging by perfecting cloning; vast banks of clones, kept in stasis, held multiple copies of each living Kryptonian so that replacement parts were always available in the event of injury. All Kryptonians were now effectively immortal, &quot;with all the strength and vigor of youth maintained&quot;, and for millennia they enjoyed an idyllic, sensual existence in an Arcadian paradise.

100,000 years later Kryptonian society was tipping toward decadence and eventually political strife resulted from the debate about the use of clones (three by each Kryptonian; one child, one teen and one adult, perfectly preserved in stasis in large clone banks) to repair any hurt and avoiding death, if they were sentient beings and should have rights to be awakened to live as any other Kryptonian, sparked in addition by the presence of an alien missionary known as the Cleric, who carried &quot;the Eradicator&quot;. Eventually this disagreement led to open violent conflict. A woman named Nyra, seeking what she considered a suitable mate for her son, Kan-Z, had one of her younger clones removed from stasis. The clone gained full sentience and was presented to society as a normal woman. When Kan-Z discovered that his fiancée was in fact his mother&#x27;s clone, he killed the clone, then publicly killed his mother and also attempted his own suicide before being stopped. Kan-Z also publicly broadcast the entirety of his discovered findings as to what his mother had done across the entire planet. This key incident ignited the Clone Wars which lasted for 1,000 years, during which Kryptonian science was turned to warfare and several superweapons were developed and used. Among them was the device known as the Destroyer.

Although the Eradicator&#x27;s effects (altering the DNA of all Kryptonian lifeforms so that they would instantly die upon leaving the planet) were felt immediately, the Destroyer&#x27;s effects were possibly more significant: by the time the Kryptonian government admitted defeat and abolished the clone banks, a pro-clone rights terrorist faction known as Black Zero had started the Destroyer (activated by Kan-Z himself), a device which functioned as a giant atomic energy gun, projecting massive streams of nuclear energy into the core of Krypton, intended to trigger an explosive chain reaction within Krypton&#x27;s core almost immediately.

The destruction (by Van-L, an ancestor of Jor-El) of the Destroyer eliminated the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; city of Kandor in a fiery nuclear explosion, but it was believed at the time that the device had been stopped before it could achieve planetary destruction. Centuries later, Jor-El himself would discover that the reaction had only been slowed to a nearly imperceptible rate and it would eventually destroy the planet as intended.

====Destruction====
Though it survived the war, Krypton was scarred deeply by it. The formerly lush garden world was burned and blasted to a desert, and a sterile society—emotionally unlike its predecessor—emerged. The population lived isolated from one another in widely separated technological citadels, shunning all physical and personal contact, to the point that even family members would only interact with each other via communication devices. Procreation became a matter of selecting compatible genetic material to be placed within an artificial womb called a &quot;birthing matrix&quot;; the parents almost never met in person and never touched one another. The planetary government was deeply isolationist and forbade space exploration and communication with other worlds.

The young scientist Jor-El was born into this world. By his adult years, a mysterious &quot;Green Plague&quot; was killing Kryptonians by the thousands, and upon researching the matter, Jor-El discovered that its cause was growing radiation produced by Krypton&#x27;s increasingly unstable core. This process was going to cause the planet to explode.

Unable to convince his associates to abandon tradition and consider escape, and reasoning that modern Kryptonian society had grown cold, unfeeling and sterile, Jor-El removed the Eradicator&#x27;s planetary binding genes from his unborn son Kal-El&#x27;s genetic pattern, took Kal-El&#x27;s birthing matrix and attached a prototype interstellar propulsion system to the vessel. Just as the planet began to shake apart and massive, exploding streams of green energy erupted through the surface of Krypton, Jor-El launched the matrix towards Earth, where it would open and give birth to the infant upon landing (the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Superman therefore was considered to be technically &quot;born&quot; on Earth). Jor-El was not only determined that his son would survive the death of his birthworld, but that he would grow up on a world that vibrantly embraced living, as his forebears once did.

====The Last Son of Krypton====
A central theme of this version of the Superman mythos was that the character was to remain the last surviving remnant of Krypton. Thus, Silver Age elements such as Supergirl, Krypto, Beppo, and Kandor had never existed in this version (though Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; versions of these elements were eventually reintroduced).

The supervillain Doomsday was revealed in the 1990s as a being genetically engineered by Bertron, an alien scientist, on an ancient Krypton. Doomsday left the planet after killing Bertron and Krypton&#x27;s natives found the remains of Bertron&#x27;s lab, thus obtaining the knowledge of cloning.

In the newer continuity, Superman also became aware of his alien heritage only sometime after his debut as a superhero - initially assuming himself to be a human mutated in some manner and launched as part of an Earth space program - when a holographic program encoded into the craft which brought him to Earth uploaded the information into his brain (although Lex Luthor had earlier discovered his alien heritage when his attempts to create a clone of Superman were complicated by the unexpected x-factor of Superman&#x27;s alien DNA).

====Revisiting Krypton====
In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #600 (May 1988), Krypton was close enough to Earth that the radiation from its explosion (traveling only at light speed) was able to reach Earth.

In a 1988 storyline, Superman traveled to the former site of Krypton to discover that the planet was slowly reforming from the vast sphere of debris remaining. It would take millions of years before the planet would be solid again. This sphere of debris had been turned to kryptonite by the planet&#x27;s destruction, and the radiation caused Superman to have a hallucination in which the entire population of Krypton came to Earth and colonized the already inhabited planet, prompting Jor-El to initiate a Terran-based resistance movement, pitting him against his estranged wife Lara and now-grown son Kal-El, at which point the hallucination ended.

In &quot;Superman: The Man of Steel Annual&quot; #3, &quot;Unforgiven&quot; - an Elseworlds tale - Jor-El convinces the Science Council to relocate selected Kryptonians to Earth.

In a 1999 &quot;Starman&quot; storyline, Jack Knight became lost in time and space, and landed on Krypton several years before its destruction, meeting Jor-El as a young man. The story implies that it was this early meeting with a Terran that led Jor-El to study other worlds and eventually choose Earth as the target for his son&#x27;s spacecraft; at the story&#x27;s end, Jack gives Jor-El a device with the coordinates and images of Earth.

In a 2001–2002 storyline, an artificial version of the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Krypton was created in the Phantom Zone by Brainiac 13, a descendant of the original Brainiac who had traveled back in time to the present. This version of Krypton was based on Jor-El&#x27;s favorite Kryptonian historical period.

====&quot;Superman: Birthright&quot;====
In the 2004 miniseries &quot;&quot;, a new retelling of Superman&#x27;s origin and early years, Mark Waid located Krypton in the Andromeda Galaxy 2.5 million light-years away, and adopted elements from several previous versions of the planet. Although usually depicted as a red giant or red supergiant, in this story Rao is mentioned by Jor-El to be a red dwarf.

In previous comic versions, it was assumed the &quot;S&quot; shield on Superman&#x27;s costume simply stood for &quot;Superman&quot;; in &quot;Birthright&quot;, Waid presented it as a Kryptonian symbol of hope; he borrowed and modified a concept from &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, wherein the &quot;S&quot; was the symbol of the House of El, Superman&#x27;s ancestral family.

====Post-&quot;Birthright&quot; revisions====
Beginning with &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, writer Geoff Johns began laying subtle hints to a new origin for Superman. , a storyline co-written by Geoff Johns and &quot;Superman&quot; film director Richard Donner, further delves into this version of Krypton which reintroduces General Zod and the Phantom Zone criminals into mainstream continuity as well as the crystalline technology known as &quot;Sunstones&quot;. With art by Adam Kubert, the design of Kryptonian society is distinct yet again from &quot;Birthright&quot;, incorporating elements of both Pre-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; continuity and Donner&#x27;s work on the first two Christopher Reeve films, in particular the notion of Krypton&#x27;s Council threatening Jor-El with harsh punishment if he were to make public his predictions of their planet&#x27;s imminent doom. This variation of Krypton&#x27;s past was again seen in flashbacks during Johns&#x27; &quot;Brainiac&quot; and &quot;New Krypton&quot; story arcs. The very different depictions of Kryptonian clothing in the Golden and Silver Age comics, in the Christopher Reeve films, and in John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; all appeared in Johns&#x27; &quot;&quot; (which superseded &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;&quot;).

Multi-ethnic versions of Kryptonians that resemble Africans, Indigenous Australians, Pacific Islanders, Indigenous Americans, and Asians have also made appearances in the stories. Previously, &quot;black&quot; Kryptonians were mainly confined within the Kryptonian continent of Vathlo Island, but a 2011 storyline depicted Kryptonians resembling black and Asian humans who were more integrated into Kryptonian society than they were in the Silver and pre-Modern Age DC Universe.

====&quot;The New 52&quot;====
Following Grant Morrison&#x27;s run on &quot;Action Comics&quot; during &quot;The New 52&quot;, Krypton is again a scientific and cultural utopia, and Kryptonians themselves are highly intelligent, even from infancy; Morrison describes Krypton as &quot;the planet of your dreams. A scientific utopia. I wanted to explore Krypton as the world of super people. What would happen if they worked it all out, if they lived for 500 years with amazing technology?&quot; Cody Walker elaborates on this, saying that &quot;Kal-El is the next step in evolution physically, but he comes from a planet that is the next stage in evolution as well. If his strength makes him the Man of Steel, then the ideologies that rule his planet make Superman the Man of Tomorrow&quot;. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #14 (January 2013 cover date, published November 7, 2012) astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson appears as a character in the story. He determines that Krypton orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus 27.1 light-years from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star that would be an appropriate parent star to Krypton. He picked Corvus, which is Latin for &quot;crow&quot;, because Superman&#x27;s high school mascot is a crow. In a 2012 round-table discussion, Tyson stated that he chose to use real science when finding Krypton&#x27;s location. He explained that many artists may only use bits and pieces of science, allowing for greater latitude in their creativity, but he wanted to show that using real science, particularly astrophysics, allows for just as much creativity.

==Known locations==
* Bokos - it was nicknamed the Isle of Thieves.
* Lurvan - the largest continent on Krypton.
** Argo City - one of the largest cities on Krypton. In many continuities, it is portrayed as having survived Krypton&#x27;s destruction due to a protective field. Supergirl and her family were from Argo City.
** Fire Falls - a natural geological location where lava flows down a cliff.
** Jewel Mountains - a mountain range on Krypton. This was the location that Jax-Ur traveled back in time to in order to create Jewel Kryptonite.
** Kandor - the capital city of Krypton. It was bottled by Brainiac.
** Fort Rozz - a military command center in Kandor.
** Plane of Wanan - a desolate location outside of Kandor.
** Kryptonopolis - the largest city on Krypton and home to Jor-El and Lara. Kal-El was born here.
* Urrika - one of two continents found on Krypton.
** Erkol - a city-state that had been in a war with Xan City.
** Xan City - one of the oldest cities found on Krypton. It was destroyed in a long war with Erkol.
* Vathlo Island - an island continent. This location is where the black Kryptonians reside.
* Orvai - a lakeside city and the home of Quex-Ul.
* Surrus - a city in southern Continent, named after their singing Flowers Surrus (&quot;Superman&quot; #236, 1971).

==In other media==
===Radio===
The first non-comics version of Krypton was presented in the debut storyline of the 1940s &quot;Superman&quot; radio series. In the radio show, Krypton was part of the Solar System, a Counter-Earth sharing Earth&#x27;s orbit but on the opposite side of the Sun, hidden from view of the Earth (&quot;Krypton&quot; derives from the Greek word for &quot;hidden&quot;). Some comics of the early 1950s suggested a similar theory, but in general the comics have depicted Krypton as being in a far-away star system.

===Television===
====Live-action====
* Krypton appears in the pilot episode of &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. In this version, Jor-El proposes transporting the entire Kryptonian population to Earth via a fleet of rockets, but his proposal is rejected and the planet begins to break apart sooner than he expected anyway, leaving him only with a small test rocket, in which he and Lara use to launch Kal-El off.
* Krypton appears in &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;. At the end of the third season, it is revealed that a sizable colony survived the planet&#x27;s destruction. From what was shown of the colony (called New Krypton), the society, despite the advanced technology, had numerous archaic elements, like hereditary rule, arranged marriage for nobles, and trial by combat being legal for nobility. Unlike many incarnations, New Krypton is not isolated from other races; it has starships, including a large vessel that serves as its palace, and Nor hires an assassin from another race to kill Kal-El.
* The television series &quot;Smallville&quot; presents a version of Krypton that mirrors the &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot; aesthetic but has more ties to Earth. It was a peaceful and advanced planet until civil war broke out, leading to its destruction in 1986 by General Zod and the renegade Zor-El after they used Brainiac to ignite Krypton&#x27;s unstable core. Numerous Kryptonian artifacts come into play during the show, such as the &quot;Stones of Power&quot; in season 4 (used to contain all information in the known 28 galaxies and become the Crystal of Knowledge to make the Fortress of Solitude), &quot;The Orb&quot; in season 8 (containing the DNA of fallen Kryptonian citizens/soldiers scanned and cloned by Jor-El), and its bible &quot;The Book of Rao&quot; (used to transport Kryptonians to &quot;Heaven&quot;) during season 9. In season 2, more Kryptonian glyphs appear on Earth via the Kawatche Caves as there are prophecies discovered about a &quot;Traveler&quot; planted by Jor-El visiting Smallville.
* Krypton is featured in the Arrowverse &quot;Supergirl&quot; series, with its destruction depicted in the pilot. Kara was sent to Earth to protect her then-infant cousin, Kal-El. Krypton exploded just seconds after her pod took off, sending it into the Phantom Zone. The episode &quot;Hostile Takeover&quot; revealed that the planet was destroyed due to over-mining its core. The third-season episode &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; revealed that Argo City was preserved along with many of the inhabitants on an asteroid formed from Kryptonian debris.
* Krypton is the main setting of the titular series of the same name. The main characters are Seg-El, Adam Strange, Kem, Lyta-Zod, Val-El, Nyssa-Vex, Jayna-Zod and Dev-Em. This version of Krypton became unstable after Brainiac steals Kandor in the original timeline, an event that forces Seg to stop with allies like Adam Strange from the future and even the future General Dru-Zod. This version also borrows some elements from the initial post-Crisis depiction, such as the reproduction of Kryptonians through artificial means in Genesis Chamber birthing facility. In the first season, 200 years before the birth of Kal-El, Krypton is ruled by a powerful religious figure known as Voice of Rao and the planet is divided in several guilds. Due to its decadent lifestyle of some Kryptonians, this causes a social inequality and those who are not in the guilds become Rankless. When Seg discovers that Voice of Rao is a puppet controlled by Brainiac, he forms a resistance movement of several friends and allies, including his son from the future, General Zod. After trapping Brainiac and Seg in the Phantom Zone, Zod takes power in Krypton, forcing all Rankless to become Sagitari soldiers and cutting some guilds, such as Religious and Lawmaker. In the second season, Seg returns to Krypton and gathers some of the surviving allies in order to stop Zod&#x27;s murderous conquest. Zod also sends Sagitari and Doomsday weapon on the moon Wegthor to crush the rebels. After the moon is destroyed, Seg and almost all the rebels return to Krypton. When Seg and Lyta expose Zod&#x27;s treachery, Zod tries to kill them, but is defeated and Sagitari forces are defeated by the resistance, ending a civil war on Krypton.

====Animation====
* Krypton was briefly depicted in the first Fleischer Studios-produced &quot;Superman&quot; cartoon in the early 1940s as &quot;a planet that burned like a green star in the distant heavens [and where] civilization was far advanced and it brought forth a race of Supermen whose mental and physical powers were developed to the absolute peak of human perfection&quot;, implying that all Kryptonians had Superman&#x27;s abilities even on their own planet. The planet is seen only from a distance, just before its explosion.
* Depictions of Krypton appear on both &quot;The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;Super Friends&quot;; in one of the &quot;lost episodes&quot; of &quot;Super Friends&quot; season of 1983–1984), &quot;The Krypton Syndrome&quot;, Jor-El says that Krypton will be enveloped by their sun and explode a short time later.
* In the &quot;&quot; three-part premiere episode, &quot;The Last Son of Krypton&quot;, Krypton&#x27;s climate is shown to have both temperate and Arctic conditions. According to commentary on the DVD collection of the show&#x27;s first season, part of Krypton&#x27;s appearance was influenced by the art style of Jack Kirby.
** In this version, Krypton was destroyed by its core destabilizing, with Brainiac choosing to save himself by transferring his consciousness into a satellite rather than save Krypton&#x27;s people. The rest of Kryptonian civilization (save for Jor-El and his family) remained unaware of the danger until it was too late to evacuate.
** Krypton had a &quot;sister planet&quot; named Argo (named after Argo City), colonized by Kryptonians many centuries before the destruction of Krypton. Krypton&#x27;s destruction pushed Argo out of orbit, causing it to gradually cool. Its people went into cryostasis to survive, but their pods malfunctioned and shut down over time, leaving Supergirl the only survivor.
* Krypton appears in the &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; episode &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;. In this version, Jor-El found a way to save the planet with his creation, the Messenger, which was kept in Kandor. Therefore, when Brainiac shrunk and stole the city, the planet&#x27;s destruction was assured. At the end of the episode, the Legion use the Messenger to restore Krypton, and Kandor is restored to full size so its people can begin life anew.
* Krypton appears in the &quot;DC Super Hero Girls&quot; episode &quot;#DCSuperHeroBoys&quot;. In a flashback, Alura Zor-El tells Zod that Krypton is collapsing on itself. She uses a device to send Zod and his minions Ursa and Non to the Phantom Zone, then tells Kara that she is sending her to join her cousin Kal.
* Krypton appears in &quot;My Adventures with Superman&quot;. In this version, Kryptonians lead an interstellar expansionist empire until they encountered a superior opponent, resulting in the planet&#x27;s destruction and the Kryptonian race&#x27;s extinction with the exception of two; the children of House El, Kal-El and Kara Zor-El, who were sent away by their respective fathers in order to escape the malevolent entity&#x27;s genocide. Brainiac then used derelict Kryptonian warships and technology and manipulated it with the intention of starting a campaign of conquest and revealed that he was responsible for destroying the planet to avoid being decommissioned after Jor-El began peace talks with the unnamed enemy.

===Film===
====&quot;Superman&quot;====

In the first feature-length &quot;Superman&quot; film in 1978, a vastly less idyllic image of Krypton was presented. Whereas in the comics Krypton was colorful and bright, the film depicted the planet with stark bluish-white terrain of jagged frozen plateaus under heavy, dark skies. The planet was threatened by their sun turning into a supernova. Jor-El unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the council of elders to immediately evacuate the planet.

Kryptonians themselves were portrayed as coolly cerebral and morally enlightened, clad in stark white bodysuits emblazoned with each family&#x27;s house symbol. The architecture featured halls of white crystal under crystalline arches. The crystalline motif was employed not only in the architecture, but in the landscape and technology as well, suggesting that the entire planet had been adapted and altered by Kryptonian influence. In 1948, Krypton was ultimately destroyed when its red sun began to collapse; the planet was pulled into the sun and steadily crushed, then exploded in the ensuing supernova. When Krypton was destroyed, fragments from the planet were launched into space, resulting in the creation of a harmful radioactive substance known as kryptonite.

Both Jor-El and Lara preserved some part of their &quot;essence&quot; (in the form of virtual copies of themselves) in the starship that took three years to bring their child to Earth. On Clark Kent&#x27;s eighteenth birthday, a glowing crystal revealed itself in the ship and compelled Clark to take it north. He eventually reached the Arctic, where the crystal constructed the massive crystalline Fortress of Solitude. Inside, an artificially intelligent hologram of Jor-El appeared to him and initiated twelve years of Kryptonian education. These virtual versions of Jor-El and Lara remained as constructs within the Fortress throughout the series.

Superman&#x27;s symbol was given a Kryptonian origin in the film. Male Kryptonians were shown wearing unique symbols on the chests of their robes, similar to a family crest; Jor-El and Kal-El wore the familiar S-shield, which Lois Lane later assumed to be the letter &quot;S&quot; from the familiar Latin alphabet, and thus dubs him &quot;Superman&quot;.

====&quot;Superman Returns&quot;====
The 2006 film &quot;Superman Returns&quot; presents a version of Krypton almost identical to &quot;Superman&quot;. In the beginning of the film, scientists discover remains of Krypton, and Superman leaves Earth for five years to look for it. His ship is seen leaving the dead planet. The planet is destroyed when the red supergiant Rao becomes a supernova.

&quot;Superman Returns&quot; extends the crystalline Kryptonian technology from &quot;Superman&quot; which allowed young Clark Kent to &quot;grow&quot; the Fortress of Solitude. Kryptonian crystals are able to grow huge land masses and incorporate the properties of the surrounding environment; a sliver taken from one of the crystals used to test the theory causes Lex Luthor&#x27;s basement to be filled with a huge crystal structure. Growing land in this manner causes widespread power failure. Lex Luthor later combines one of the crystals with kryptonite and shoots it into the ocean, creating a new land mass he calls &quot;New Krypton&quot;. Superman uses his heat vision to get under the crust of the island and throws it into space, including the other crystals that Luthor wanted to use to set up a real estate scam, despite the warning that many people would die from the massive tsunamis and earthquakes that the crystals would create.

The novelization by Marv Wolfman states that one of Superman&#x27;s ancestors helped civilize Krypton long ago.

====DC Extended Universe====
The &quot;DC Extended Universe&quot;&#x27;s Krypton is introduced in the 2013 film &quot;Man of Steel&quot; and adds strong dystopian elements to Krypton and its fate. The planet is portrayed as having an Earth-like terrain composed of mountains, canyons and oceans. The planet is 8.7 billion years old and approximately 27.1 light years from Earth. Its parent star Rao is depicted as a 13 billion year old red dwarf sun. Its gravity is much higher than that of Earth, and its atmospheric composition is unsuitable for humans. It is also shown to have a natural satellite. Kryptonian society is oligarchal and divided into houses, such as the House of El. Citizens wear the crests of their house over their chests, which hold meanings, such as the crest of House of El meaning &quot;hope&quot;. The planet is ruled by an aristocratic &quot;Science Council&quot;.

Kryptonian civilization is at least 100,000 years old and many millennia more advanced than human civilization on Earth, and had begun exploring the Milky Way Galaxy, with at least one ship reaching as far as Earth. After their colonies collapse, Kryptonians abandon these projects in favor of isolationism and artificial population control, engineering newborns for pre-determined roles in society. By the early 1980&#x27;s, the planet&#x27;s resources were strained, and the stability of the planet was threatened by careless mining of the planet&#x27;s core. As Jor-El attempts to warn the Science Council of their folly, General Zod stages a coup, which in turn sets off a massive civil war across the planet. In hopes of preserving the Kryptonian race, Jor-El steals the genetic Codex of the planet (a list holding the DNA pattern of everyone yet to be born on Krypton) and infuses it into the cells of Kal-El, the first natural-born child on Krypton in centuries and sends his son to Earth. Zod kills Jor-El and is arrested by the authorities. He and his followers are banished to the Phantom Zone shortly before Krypton is destroyed. The planets destruction frees Zod and his men from the Phantom Zone, and after learning of Earth&#x27;s existence, they vow to terraform it into a new Krypton.

In the 2016 film &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, Lex Luthor Jr. who in a deal with a Senator gained access to the crashed Scout Ship, managed to enter the ship using the fingerprints of General Zod. Using Zod&#x27;s Command Key, he managed to access the Ship&#x27;s mainframe. Luthor eventually overrides General Zod&#x27;s authority over the ship, and learns how to use the Genesis Chamber. The Ship warned against what it would create, but Lex ordered it to proceed. Over the course of a couple of days, Zod&#x27;s body began metamorphosing into a &quot;Kryptonian Deformities&quot;, a crime among the Kryptonian Science Council.

====&quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot;====
Krypton appears in &quot;Teen Titans Go! To the Movies&quot;. In the film, the Teen Titans travel to the planet and harmonize its crystals with music, preventing its destruction and preventing Kal-El from arriving on Earth and becoming Superman, although they later undo this and allow Krypton to be destroyed to ensure Superman&#x27;s existence.

====&quot;Superman: Unbound&quot;====
Brainiac&#x27;s abduction of Kandor, despite the resistance posed by Krypton&#x27;s military, is shown in &quot;&quot;. Brainiac is infamous for destroying the planet&#x27;s he takes cities from, but he left Krypton intact. Jor-El correctly theorized that this was because Brainiac detected that the planet would soon explode anyway and decided not to bother wasting a missile on their sun. Jor-El and his brother Zor-El then sent their children to Earth on rockets while studying how to defeat Brainiac and convince their government of the danger to Krypton. At least some of the populace of Argo City also outlive their planet, but rather than preserving their city with an energy shield, they are abducted by Brainiac before the planet&#x27;s destruction in response to Zor-El studying how to defeat the villain.

====&quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot;====
In &quot;DC League of Super-Pets&quot;, the destruction of Krypton is depicted as the opening scene where Jor-El and Lara prepare to send Kal-El to Earth, but in this depiction, Kal-El&#x27;s pet dog, Krypto, jumps into his carrier to accompany him. Jor-El reluctantly agrees to send him off in hopes that his son will have a lifelong friend to be there for him.

===Novelizations===
====&quot;Last Son of Krypton&quot;====
The 1978 novel &quot;&quot; by Elliot S! Maggin contains descriptions of Krypton, mainly referencing the Silver Age version; it describes the planet as a &quot;failed star&quot; with massive surface gravity and hostile conditions, which forced extreme adaptation and rapid evolution in the descendants of humanoid space travelers. This led to an extremely strong, dense, and durable Kryptonian species with unusual physical properties. Maggin describes the rise of a civilization which uses geothermal heat as its primary power source, developing science and technology, but finding it difficult to escape the massive world&#x27;s gravity. Eventually its internal nuclear reactions led to Krypton&#x27;s explosion.

====&quot;The Last Days of Krypton&quot;====
Novelist Kevin J. Anderson presents approximately the last Earth year before Krypton&#x27;s destruction in the 2007 novel &quot;The Last Days of Krypton&quot;. Jor-El, Lara, Zod, and Zor-El are the primary point-of-view characters. Following Brainiac&#x27;s abduction of Kandor, Zod attempts to seize power, eventually leading to a civil war. Here Jor-El manages to avert several disasters threatening Krypton before an attempt to destroy the Phantom Zone by several reactionary council members who Zod had previously imprisoned there destabilizes Krypton&#x27;s core and destroys the planet. In addition to Kal-El&#x27;s rocket and the forcefield surrounding Argo City, a third avenue for escaping the planet is represented by hordes of engineers who do believe Jor-El&#x27;s warning and attempt to build several space arks to escape the planet. Ultimately, they are unable to complete the ships fast enough. In the novel, Kryptonopolis is built over the ruins of Xan City.

<text>A double entendre (plural double entendres) is a figure of speech or a particular way of wording that is devised to have a double meaning, one of which is typically obvious, and the other often conveys a message that would be too socially unacceptable, or offensive to state directly.

A double entendre may exploit puns or word play to convey the second meaning. Double entendres generally rely on multiple meanings of words, or different interpretations of the same primary meaning. They often exploit ambiguity and may be used to introduce it deliberately in a text. Sometimes a homophone can be used as a pun. When three or more meanings have been constructed, this is known as a &quot;triple entendre,&quot; etc.

== Etymology ==
According to the Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary and the Oxford English Dictionary, the expression comes from the rare and obsolete French expression, which literally meant &quot;double meaning&quot; and was used in the senses of &quot;double understanding&quot; or &quot;ambiguity&quot; but acquired its current suggestive twist in English after being first used in 1673 by John Dryden. The phrase has not been used in French for centuries and would be ungrammatical in modern French. No exact equivalent exists in French, whose similar expressions (&quot;mot/expression à&quot;) &quot;double entente&quot; and (&quot;mot/expression à&quot;) &quot;double sens&quot; do not have the suggestiveness of the English expression.

== Structure ==
A person who is unfamiliar with the hidden or alternative meaning of a sentence may fail to detect its innuendos, aside from observing that others find it humorous for no apparent reason. Innuendo is often used in sitcoms and other comedy where some in the audience may enjoy the humour while being oblivious to its secondary meaning.

A triple entendre is a phrase that can be understood in any of three ways, such as in the back cover of the 1981 Rush album &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; which shows a moving company carrying paintings out of a building while people are shown being emotionally moved and a film crew makes a &quot;moving picture&quot; of the whole scene.

== Usage ==

=== Literature ===
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, when Odysseus is captured by the Cyclops Polyphemus, he tells the Cyclops that his name is Oudeis (ουδεις = No-one). When Odysseus attacks the Cyclops later that night and stabs him in the eye, the Cyclops runs out of his cave, yelling to the other Cyclopes that &quot;No-one has hurt me!,&quot; which leads the other Cyclopes to take no action under the assumption that Polyphemus blinded himself by accident, allowing Odysseus and his men to escape.
Some of the earliest double entendres are found in the 10th-century Exeter Book, or &quot;Codex exoniensis&quot;, at Exeter Cathedral in England. In addition to the various poems and stories found in the book, there are also numerous riddles. Answers to the riddles were not included in the book, but have been found by scholars over the years. Some of these employ double entendres, such as Riddle 25:

This suggests the answer &quot;a penis&quot; but also has the innocent answer &quot;an onion.&quot;

Examples of sexual innuendo and double-entendre occur in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; (14th century), in which the Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale is laden with double entendres. These include her use of the word &quot;queynte&quot; (modern spelling &quot;quaint&quot;) to describe domestic duties while also alluding to genitalia (&quot;queynte&quot; being at the time an alternate form of &quot;cunt,&quot; a term for the vulva).

The title of Sir Thomas More&#x27;s 1516 fictional work &quot;Utopia&quot; is a double entendre because of the pun between two Greek-derived words that would have identical pronunciation. Spelled as it is, or especially spelled as &quot;Outopia,&quot; the title means &quot;no place;&quot; meanwhile spelled as &quot;Eutopia,&quot; with the same English pronunciation, it would mean &quot;good place.&quot;

=== Stage performances ===

Shakespeare frequently used double entendres in his plays. Sir Toby Belch in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; says of Sir Andrew&#x27;s hair, that &quot;it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off&quot;; the Nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; says that her husband had told Juliet when she was learning to walk that &quot;Yea, dost thou fall upon thy face? Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;&quot; or is told the time by Mercutio: &quot;for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon;&quot; and in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Hamlet publicly torments Ophelia with a series of sexual puns, including &quot;country matters&quot; (similar to &quot;cunt&quot;). The title of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; is a pun on the Elizabethan use of &quot;no-thing&quot; as slang for vagina.

In the UK, starting in the 19th century, Victorian morality disallowed sexual innuendo in the theatre as being unpleasant, particularly for the ladies in the audience. In music hall songs, on the other hand, this kind of innuendo remained very popular. Marie Lloyd&#x27;s song &quot;She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas&quot; is an example of this. In the early 20th century restrictions were placed on lewdness in performances, including some prosecutions. It was the job of the Lord Chamberlain to examine the scripts of all plays for indecency. Nevertheless, some comedians still continued to get away with it. Max Miller had two books of jokes, a white book and a blue book, and would ask his audience which book they wanted to hear stories from. If they chose the blue book, he could blame the audience for the lewdness to follow (in the UK, &quot;blue&quot; colloquially refers to sexual content, as in &quot;blue jokes,&quot; &quot;blue movies&quot; etc.).

=== Radio and television ===

In the United States, innuendo and double entendre were only lightly used in radio media until the 1980s when the Howard Stern Show began to push the envelope of what was acceptable on the radio through use of double entendre and ironies. This garnered so much attention it spawned an entire genre of radio called &quot;shock jock radio&quot; where DJs will push the limits of what is an &quot;acceptable&quot; double entendre to use over-the-air as the Federal Communications Commission has been known to hand out large fines for the use of double entendre on radio if they deem it to be in violation of their standards.

In Britain, innuendo humour began to transfer to radio and cinema in the late 1950s. Particularly significant in this respect were the &quot;Carry On&quot; series of films and the BBC radio series &quot;Round the Horne&quot;; although some of &quot;Round the Horne&quot; appeared to be nonsense language, the protagonists were sometimes having &quot;rude&quot; conversations in Polari (gay slang). &quot;Round the Horne&quot; depended heavily on innuendo and double entendre, the show&#x27;s name itself being a triple entendre, a play on the name of its central actor Kenneth Horne and those around him, the sailor&#x27;s expression &quot;going round the horn&quot; (i.e. Cape Horn), and the fact that &quot;horn&quot; is slang for an erection. Spike Milligan, writer of &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, remarked that a lot of &quot;blue&quot; (i.e. sexual) innuendo came from servicemen&#x27;s jokes, which most of the cast understood (they all had been soldiers) and many of the audience understood, but which passed over the heads of most of the Senior BBC producers and directors, most of whom were &quot;Officer class.&quot;

In 1968, the office of the Lord Chamberlain ceased to have responsibility for censoring live entertainment, after the Theatres Act 1968. By the 1970s, innuendo had become widely used across much of the British broadcast media, including sitcoms and radio comedy, such as &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot;. For example, in the 1970s TV comedy series &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, Mrs. Slocombe frequently referred to her pet cat as her &quot;pussy,&quot; apparently unaware of how easily her statement could be misinterpreted, such as &quot;It&#x27;s a wonder I&#x27;m here at all, you know. My pussy got soakin&#x27; wet. I had to dry it out in front of the fire before I left.&quot; Someone unfamiliar with sexual slang might find this statement funny simply because of the references to her sodden cat, whereas others would find further humour in the innuendo (&quot;pussy&quot; being sexual slang for vulva).

Modern comedies, such as the US version of &quot;The Office&quot;, often do not hide the addition of sexual innuendos into the script; for example, main character Michael Scott often deploys the phrase &quot;that&#x27;s what she said&quot; after another character&#x27;s innocent statement, to turn it retroactively into a sexual pun.

On The Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with double meanings in a humorous context, a feature known as &quot;Innuendo Bingo.&quot; Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.

=== Movies ===
Double entendres are popular in modern movies, as a way to conceal adult humour in a work aimed at general audiences. The James Bond films are rife with such humour. For example, in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997), when Bond is disturbed by the telephone while in bed with a Danish girl, he explains to Moneypenny that he is busy &quot;brushing up on a little Danish&quot;. Moneypenny responds by pointing out that Bond was known as &quot;a cunning linguist,&quot; a play on the word &quot;cunnilingus.&quot; In the final scene of &quot;Moonraker&quot;, while Bond is taking Dr Holly Goodhead &quot;round the world one more time,&quot; Q says to Sir Frederick Gray, &quot;I think he&#x27;s attempting re-entry, sir.&quot; In &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999), while in bed with Dr Christmas Jones, Bond tells her &quot;I thought Christmas only comes once a year.&quot; Other obvious examples include Pussy Galore in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; and Holly Goodhead in &quot;Moonraker&quot;. The double entendres of the Bond films were parodied in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series.

Bawdy double entendres, such as (from the movie &quot;Sextette&quot;) &quot;I&#x27;m the kinda girl who works for Paramount by day, and Fox all night,&quot; and (from the movie &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot;) &quot;I feel like a million tonight – but only one at a time,&quot; are typical of the comedy writing of Mae West, for her early-career vaudeville performances as well as for her later plays and movies.

=== Music ===

There is a long tradition of double entendre songs in American blues music of the 1920s and 1930s, called hokum.

Double entendres are very common in the titles and lyrics of pop songs, such as &quot;If I Said You Had a Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me&quot; by The Bellamy Brothers. By one interpretation, the person being talked to is asked if they would be offended; by the other interpretation, they are asked if they would press their body against the person doing the talking.

Singer and songwriter Bob Dylan, in his somewhat controversial song &quot;Rainy Day Women No. 12 &amp; 35,&quot; repeats the line &quot;Everybody must get stoned.&quot; In context, the phrase refers to the punishment of execution by stoning, but on another level it means to &quot;get stoned,&quot; a common slang term for being high on cannabis. In their song &quot;Big Balls&quot; on the album &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;, AC/DC the chorus &quot;we&#x27;ve got big balls&quot; can be read as referring to either formal dances or testicles. During the 1940s, Benny Bell recorded several &quot;party records&quot; that contained double entendre including &quot;Everybody Wants My Fanny.&quot;

=== Social interaction ===
Double entendres can arise in the replies to inquiries. The clichéd phrase &quot;Said the actress to the bishop,&quot; as well as &quot;that&#x27;s what she said,&quot; can be used to remark on a sentence said by another which was not intended as a double entendre but nevertheless could be interpreted with a double meaning, one of them sexual.

<text>Cartomancy is fortune-telling or divination using a deck of cards. Forms of cartomancy appeared soon after playing cards were introduced into Europe in the 14th century. Practitioners of cartomancy are generally known as &quot;cartomancers&quot;, &quot;card readers&quot;, or simply &quot;readers&quot;.

Cartomancy using standard playing cards was the most popular form of providing fortune-telling card readings in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The standard 52-card deck is often augmented with jokers or even with the blank card found in many packaged decks. In France, the 32-card piquet stripped deck is most typically used in cartomantic readings, although the 52 card deck can also be used. (A piquet deck can be a 52-card deck with all of the 2s through the 6s removed. This leaves all of the 7s through the 10s, the face cards, and the aces.)

In English-speaking countries, the most common form of cartomancy is generally tarot card reading. Tarot cards are almost exclusively used for this purpose in these places.

==Methods==
The most popular method of cartomancy using a standard playing deck is referred to as the &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Here, the reader removes cards at random and assigns significance to them based on the order they were chosen. Though the interpretation of various cards varies by region, the common significators for the future are as follows:

<doc id="75813" wikidata="Q522623" url="?curid=75813" title="Crisis on Infinite Earths">
<text>Crisis on Infinite Earths is a 1985 to 1986 American comic book crossover series published by DC Comics. Written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by George Pérez, it was first released as a 12-issue limited series from April 1985 to March 1986. As the main piece of a crossover event, some plot elements were featured in tie-in issues of other publications. Since its initial publication, the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions.

The idea for the series stemmed from Wolfman&#x27;s desire to abandon the DC Multiverse depicted in the company&#x27;s comics—which he thought was unfriendly to readers—and create a single, unified DC Universe (DCU). The foundation of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; developed through a character called the Monitor, introduced in Wolfman&#x27;s &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; in July 1982 before the series itself started.

At the start of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Anti-Monitor (the Monitor&#x27;s evil counterpart) is unleashed on the DC Multiverse and begins to destroy the various Earths that it comprises. The Monitor tries to recruit heroes from around the Multiverse but is murdered, while Brainiac collaborates with the villains to conquer the remaining Earths. Eventually, both the heroes and villains are united by the Spectre; the series concludes with Kal-L, Superboy-Prime and Alexander Luthor Jr. defeating the Anti-Monitor and the creation of a single Earth in place of the Multiverse. &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; is noted for its high death count; hundreds of characters died, including DC icons Kara Zor-El (the original Supergirl) and Barry Allen (the Flash of the Silver Age). The story&#x27;s events resulted in the entire DCU being rebooted, dividing the fictional universe&#x27;s timeline into &quot;pre-Crisis&quot; and &quot;post-Crisis&quot; eras.

The series was a bestseller for DC. The story is credited with popularizing the idea of a large-scale crossover in comics. &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; is the first installment in what became known as the &quot;Crisis&quot; trilogy. It was followed by &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; (2005–2006) and &quot;Final Crisis&quot; (2008–2009). &quot;Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (2022) also served as a sequel to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

==Publication history==
===Background===
DC Comics is an American comic book publisher best known for its superhero stories featuring characters including Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The company debuted in February 1935 with &quot;New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine&quot;. Most of DC&#x27;s comic books (as well as some published under its imprints Vertigo and Young Animal) take place within a shared universe called the DC Universe (DCU) allowing plot elements, characters, and settings to cross over with each other. The concept of the DCU has provided DC&#x27;s writers some challenges in maintaining continuity, due to conflicting events within different comics that need to reflect the shared nature of the universe. &quot;Flash of Two Worlds&quot; from &quot;The Flash&quot; #123 (September 1961), which featured Barry Allen (the Silver Age Flash) teaming up with Jay Garrick (the Golden Age Flash) was the first DC comic to suggest that the DCU was a part of a multiverse.

The DC Multiverse concept was expanded in later years with the DCU having infinite Earths; for example, the Golden Age versions of DC heroes resided on Earth-Two, while DC&#x27;s Silver Age heroes were from Earth-One. Since &quot;Crisis on Earth-One!&quot; (1963), DC has used the word &quot;Crisis&quot; to describe important crossovers within the DC Multiverse. Over the years, various writers took liberties creating additional parallel Earths as plot devices and to house characters DC had acquired from other companies, making the DC Multiverse a &quot;convoluted mess&quot;. DC&#x27;s comic book sales were also far below those of their competitor Marvel Comics. According to &quot;ComicsAlliance&quot; journalist Chris Sims, &quot;the [DC] multiverse . . . felt old-fashioned. . . . Marvel, on the other hand, felt contemporary and when you stack them up against each other, there&#x27;s one difference that sticks out above anything else: Marvel feels unified.&quot;

Writer Marv Wolfman became popular among DC&#x27;s readers for his work on &quot;Weird War Tales&quot; and &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;. George Pérez, who illustrated &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, also began to rise to prominence in this era. In 1984, Pérez entered into an exclusive contract with DC, which was later extended one year. Although &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; was a major success for DC, the company&#x27;s comic book sales were still below Marvel&#x27;s. Wolfman began to attribute this to the DC Multiverse, feeling &quot;The Flash of Two Worlds&quot; had created a &quot;nightmare&quot;: it was not reader-friendly for new readers to be able to keep track of and writers struggled with the continuity errors it caused. In &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #21 (July 1982), Wolfman introduced a new character: the shadowy, potentially villainous Monitor; this laid the foundation for &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

===Development===
In 1981, Wolfman was editing &quot;Green Lantern&quot;. He got a letter from a fan asking why a character did not recognize Green Lantern in a recent issue despite the two having had worked together in an issue three years earlier. Soon afterward, Wolfman pitched &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; as &quot;The History of the DC Universe&quot;, seeing it as a way to simplify the DCU and attract new readers. &quot;The History of the DC Universe&quot;″s title was changed to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; because its premise, involving the destruction of entire worlds, sounded more like a crisis.

Wolfman said when he pitched the series to DC, he realized it was going to be a completely new beginning for the DCU. &quot;I knew up front, and they did too, how big this was going to be,&quot; he said. &quot;But, no-one knew how well it would sell, or whether it would sell at all. It was a risk DC was willing to take, because my thoughts were that DC needed a lot of help at that time, and they did too.&quot; Wolfman also said he saw it as an attempt to improve DC&#x27;s reputation for storytelling which many readers at the time saw as old-fashioned.

The crossover was fleshed out and coordinated at a meeting attended by president Jenette Kahn, Paul Levitz, vice president and executive editor Dick Giordano and DC&#x27;s editors. In 1982, DC hired a researcher to go through their library and read every comic the company had published, a task that took two years. The series was delayed to 1983 due to the time for research, and again to 1985 when it was still not ready for 1983 and to coincide with DC&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary. As an event like &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; had never happened before, those working on it met for around two hours a week, which was uncommon at the time.

The groundwork for the series was laid the year before it was published. One of the greatest challenges for Wolfman and Giordano was coming up with a story. Wolfman cited making use of every DC character and creating a plot that was fun to read and as filled with surprises as difficulties, as the series needed to sell well; if it did not, it could have caused a disaster for DC. Plotting became easier once a beginning and an ending had been determined and when Pérez became involved. &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was DC&#x27;s first mainstream maxiseries, which was still a relatively new concept.

Early in planning for &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, a list was made of characters that were part of the DCU; characters from other universes, such as those that formerly belonged to Charlton Comics, also were used. According to Wolfman, one of the purposes of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was to showcase all the characters DC had. The series is infamous for its high death count. Hundreds of characters died; among the most noted was Barry Allen&#x27;s. Wolfman has said he did not want to kill Allen, but DC ordered him to because it perceived the character as dull. Therefore, he conceived Allen&#x27;s death—in which he runs through time before vanishing—as a way to make the character seem more interesting and hopefully spare him. Wolfman wanted to make the series unforgettable; he said that many writers had expressed interest in simplifying DC&#x27;s continuity and he wanted to be the one to do so.

Pérez says he was not the intended artist for &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, but was excited when he learned about it, seeing it as an opportunity for &quot;revenge&quot; against Marvel, which he blamed for blocking the &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot; crossover he had been working on. He enjoyed working with Wolfman again, and took a leave of absence from &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; to draw the series. DC initially did not know Pérez would want to work on it. According to Pérez, he was motivated by the fact that DC did not know if the series was going to be a success. He also wanted &quot;to draw everybody I could get my hands on&quot; and called illustrating the series some of the most fun he ever had. Pérez was excited because not only did he get to draw the Teen Titans again, but also obscure characters he was not familiar with, saying he could possibly have never gotten another chance. Wolfman has said one panel in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; shows the Marvel Universe being destroyed. When Giordano (the series&#x27; initial inker) had difficulty meeting deadlines while continuing as DC vice president and executive editor, editorial coordinator Pat Bastienne reassigned the inking to Jerry Ordway despite Giordano&#x27;s objections.

===Publication===
The idea for &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was first noted in the December 1981 issue of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, which mentioned a twelve-part maxiseries scheduled for 1982. The series was announced in Giordano&#x27;s &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; column DC ran in its titles cover dated June 1984. Giordano warned readers that &quot;odd occurrences&quot; would begin to happen throughout DC&#x27;s comics. He also clarified it would commemorate DC&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary and would provide the company &quot;wonderful stepping-stones&quot; for new characters and comics. The series was marketed with the tagline &quot;Worlds will live, worlds will die and nothing will ever be the same&quot;.

The series began in January 1985 and lasted for twelve issues, ending in December 1985 (issues cover dated April 1985 through March 1986). The close spacing of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and Marvel&#x27;s similar crossover &quot;Secret Wars&quot; caused some fans to create conspiracy theories about idea theft. According to writer Steve Gerber, the series &quot;got virtually no promotion ... How many handouts did you see? How many posters did you see in people&#x27;s windows? How much information was really distributed to the press and how much was gotten just by individual reporters going to Marv Wolfman and [&quot;Crisis&quot; artist] George Pérez?&quot;

===Tie-ins===

Elements to set up &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; were put in DC&#x27;s comics years before the crossover took place; an example of this was the Monitor&#x27;s appearance in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;. In a January 3, 1983 memo, Giordano, Wolfman, and Len Wein instructed editors and writers to use the Monitor twice in the coming year but not to show him: &quot;Because this series involves the entire DC Universe we do ask that each Editor and writer cooperate with the project by using a character called The Monitor in their books twice during the next year&quot;. This served to set up the series. When Wolfman and Giordano reiterated this in a 1984 meeting, some editors were not pleased; one was so miffed he did not speak for the rest of the meeting.

Tie-ins for &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; were published in DC&#x27;s ongoing series. Unlike the 1991 Marvel crossover storyline &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, where Marvel only published tie-ins in titles that needed a boost in sales, the vast majority of DC&#x27;s comics featured events that directly tied to the crossover. The following comic book issues were labeled as part of the crossover; their covers contained a banner that read &quot;Special &quot;Crisis&quot; Cross-Over&quot;, along with the logo for DC&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary.

==Collected editions==
==Synopsis==
The conflicting stories of the DCU are explained as a Multiverse, containing many parallel universes and alternate versions of the characters, with the primary DC continuity referred to as Earth-One. They were created after renegade scientist Krona built a machine and used it to look back into the beginning of time. A cosmic being from the beginning known as the Monitor catalogues these realities, but he has an evil counterpart, the Anti-Monitor, who comes from an antimatter universe. After Pariah causes an accident with antimatter in his universe, the Anti-Monitor is released and begins destroying many of the realities with a wave of antimatter, planning on becoming sole ruler of all realities. On Earth-Three, Alexander Luthor and Lois Lane teleport their son Alexander Luthor Jr. to another reality as Earth-Three is consumed by the antimatter wave. To combat this, the Monitor recruits heroes and villains from across time and space to set up five towers, to help merge the multiverse back into one to make it stronger.

The Monitor dispatches a team of heroes across time and space to defend mysterious machines that could be the key to saving the remaining universes. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the Flash was transported to the future, and Pariah, constantly witnessing the destruction of worlds, arrives on the doomed Earth-1.

Barry Allen of Earth-One encounters the Antimatter wave before being captured by the Anti-Monitor. On Earth 1, various heroes attempt to save people from the approaching Anti Matter wave. During WWII, the Monitor&#x27;s towers appear during a battle in which Sgt. Rock, Haunted Tank, and the Losers are fighting together against Nazis.

The Monitor gives powers to Kimiyo Hoshi turning her into Doctor Light. He is murdered by Harbinger, who is possessed by one of the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s shadow demons. However, the Monitor knew this would happen and his death releases enough energy to project two of the last five parallel Earths into a protective limbo that nullifies the wave. The Anti-Monitor recruits Psycho-Pirate to his cause, infusing him with part of his power to manipulate the heroes of Earth-4, Earth-S and Earth-X against the rest; this fails when all five Earths enter the limbo universe.

Harbinger then recruits heroes from the remaining Earths to lead an assault on the Anti-Monitor in the antimatter universe, using the powers of Alexander Luthor Jr., the last survivor of Earth-Three, to open a portal between the limbo and antimatter universes. Pariah tracks down the Anti-Monitor at his fortress, and the heroes destroy a converter, powered by stellar energy, used to destroy the last five Earths; the injured Anti-Monitor retreats and Supergirl dies from his attacks after a distraction from Hoshi. The Anti-Monitor creates a new body for himself and tries to use an antimatter cannon to penetrate the limbo universe and destroy the five partially merged Earths. The Flash dies stopping this attempt by using his speed to channel energy.

During a lull in the war, the villains unite under Brainiac. He kills Earth-Two&#x27;s Alexei Luthor while recruiting the Earth-One Lex Luthor to conquer the remaining Earths. A furious Anti-Monitor absorbs the energy of millions of worlds and vows to travel back through time to prevent the creation of the multiverse. The Spectre unites the heroes and villains by warning them about the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s plan; the heroes travel back in time to stop the Anti-Monitor, while the villains travel back in time to the planet Oa to prevent Krona from creating the technology necessary for the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s plan to succeed.

The villains fail, and Krona continues his experiment. The Anti-Monitor waits for Alexander Luthor Jr. to reopen the portal between the positive and antimatter universes, capturing the heroes, but a magically empowered Spectre creates an energy overload which shatters space and time. The five Earths merge into a single shared universe, and the superheroes return to the present; only those present at the dawn of time remember the original realities.

A cosmically empowered Anti-Monitor attacks again, transporting the new Earth to the antimatter universe and summoning a horde of shadow demons who kill Dove, Lori Lemaris, Green Arrow of Earth-Two, Prince Ra-Man, Clayface, Bug-Eyed Bandit, Kole, Huntress, Robin, Sunburst, and Ten-Eyed Man. He falls in a carefully-planned counterattack, culminating in a battle with Superboy of Earth-Prime, Kal-L, and Alexander Luthor Jr., with help from Darkseid. In this final battle, the Anti-Monitor, reduced to a flaming head, crashes into a star and is killed by Kal-L. Before the star explodes, Alex sends Kal-L, Earth-Two Lois Lane, Earth-Prime Superboy and himself to a pocket &quot;paradise&quot; dimension while Wonder Woman of Earth-Two is taken to Mount Olympus by Zeus. This leaves the heroes of the remaining Earth, none of whom remember the original past, to sort out the aftermath of this crisis. Only Psycho-Pirate, who is locked up in Arkham Asylum, remembers the multiverse.

==Alternate versions==
===Tales from the Dark Multiverse===
After the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s defeat, it was the Justice League who were forever trapped fighting in Ragnarok. The Justice Society/All-Star Squadron came in to rescue the team but were outmatched by Surtur. Alan Scott then sacrificed himself by becoming the pawn of Surtur known as the Dread Lantern, leading Surtur to other worlds in exchange for his promise that he will always spare Earth.

==Reception==
Despite relatively limited marketing and DC being unsure if the series would be successful, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was a bestseller.

IGN″s Hilary Goldstein summarized the series as &quot;a crucial turning point for DC Comics&quot; and credited it with saving the company. Goldstein called Wolfman&#x27;s idea to simplify the DCU bold and unprecedented, noting the story&#x27;s exceptional size and saying the story was &quot;unbelievable&quot;, if somewhat aged. He also praised Pérez&#x27;s detailed artwork, saying no other artist could have possibly illustrated it as well as he did and gave the book a &quot;must have&quot; rating. Fellow &quot;IGN&quot; writer Jesse Schedeen named &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; one of the best DC crossovers, agreeing it was unprecedented and dramatic.

Marc Buxton of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; named &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; the greatest comic book crossover ever, saying that no crossover has been bigger or as ambitious: &quot;where some events seem hesitant to actually leave a mark on their respective universes, &quot;Crisis&quot; did it with aplomb&quot;. He praised the series for exploring the entire DCU and felt it was a fitting event for DC&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary. &quot;Nerdist News&quot; noted that many of the series&#x27; central events—such as the deaths of Supergirl and Barry Allen—have become iconic moments in DC&#x27;s history.

Not all reviewers have been as positive. Chris Sims wrote the series was messy and built awkwardly, describing it as &quot;a textbook definition of style over substance&quot;. Sims said it was far from the best work of Wolfman and Pérez; however, he still thought it was groundbreaking, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s the first time in comics history that EVERYTHING was in danger&quot;.

==Merchandise==
A novelization of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; was written by Wolfman and published by iBooks in 2005, with cover art by Pérez and Alex Ross. The book follows the events of the original series; most of the story is presented from Barry Allen&#x27;s point of view, while parts where he is not present are told from a third-person perspective. It also added some details, including internal monologue and updates to make the story more modern, such as characters having cell phones. In 2008, WizKids issued a toy pack centered around the Anti-Monitor as a part of its DC HeroClix toy line. The pack came with a large Anti-Monitor figure with LED-lit eyes, several smaller figures, and a map. An exclusive variant, based on the Sinestro Corps, was available at San Diego Comic-Con and Gen Con Indy conventions that year.

DC Collectibles (then called DC Direct) released three series of action figures between 2005 and 2006. Based on the George Pérez artwork, the figures had a base with the logo of the series and certain figures included an accessory. The first series included Earth 2 Robin, Harbinger, Monitor, Psycho-Pirate, and Supergirl. Later series included Anti Monitor, Earth 2 Superman, Flash, Battle Armor Lex Luthor, Brainiac, Earth 1 Batman, Doctor Light, Earth Prime Superboy, Earth 2 Huntress, and Weaponer of Qward.

==Legacy==
Though it was not the first large-scale comic book crossover, &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; is generally credited with popularizing the idea. Comics historian Matthew K. Manning wrote that &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; paved way for all future crossovers of similar scale, and Andrew J. Friedenthal said &quot;&quot;Crisis&quot; showed the two major superhero comic book publishers (DC Comics and Marvel Comics) how they could utilize the continuity established by decades&#x27; worth of stories to weave together a cohesive, metatextual tapestry that both appealed to long-time readers and brought in massive amounts of money&quot;. The series&#x27; success inspired DC to begin a tradition of &quot;summer crossovers&quot;; some of these include &quot;Invasion!&quot; (1988–1989), &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot; (1991), &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; (1994), and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; (2004), and some mention the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. The second part of one of DC&#x27;s later crossovers, &quot;Convergence&quot; (2015), heavily references the series and sees DC&#x27;s superheroes travel back to its era. The writers of &quot;Convergence&quot; all had fun writing stories set during &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, calling the series an exciting time for DC.

The series had an immediate effect on DC, dividing the company&#x27;s history into two eras: &quot;Pre-Crisis&quot; and &quot;Post-Crisis&quot;. Wolfman and Pérez teamed again to produce the &quot;History of the DC Universe&quot; limited series to summarize the DCU&#x27;s new history. In the post-Crisis history, during the &quot;Crisis&quot; many heroes fought the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s army. He attempted to collapse the positive universe&#x27;s past and future into a single point in time to destroy it, leaving only the antimatter universe.

Many of DC&#x27;s characters had their histories rebooted. Wonder Woman&#x27;s comic was relaunched entirely by Pérez, Wein, and Greg Potter. Superman was first re-envisioned in the limited series &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; by John Byrne; his comic was retitled &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; to make way for a new &quot;Superman&quot; series. Batman was minimally affected by the reboot, and his comic was not relaunched. However, he was still given , courtesy of Frank Miller. In addition, Wally West replaced Barry Allen as the Flash, the Justice League&#x27;s roster was changed, and characters DC acquired from other companies, such as Fawcett Publications and Charlton Comics, were integrated into the DCU. The practice of re-envisioning characters in the new DCU lasted well into 1989, with properties such as Green Lantern, Hawkman, Black Orchid, and the Suicide Squad all being rebooted. The revamp raised sales 22% in the first year, and DC beat Marvel in direct market sales for the first time in August and September 1987. &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; #1 was the bestselling comic book issue of 1986.

&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; has been referenced several times in the various television series that comprise the Arrowverse, starting with the first episode of &quot;The Flash&quot; which aired in October 2014. It features a newspaper from 2024 that reads &quot;Flash Missing, Vanishes in Crisis&quot;. Grant Gustin, who plays the Flash on the show, has said he thinks the goal of the series is to reach &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;: &quot;Obviously we&#x27;d have to go, I think 10 years to reach that, so there&#x27;s a possibility for sure. It&#x27;ll be fun to get there.&quot; The concept of a multiverse has been explored several times throughout the history of the franchise. Talking in 2014, Geoff Johns, when discussing the difference between the DC Extended Universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, said &quot;We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it&#x27;s about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It&#x27;s just a different approach.&quot; The storyline inspired the 2019 Arrowverse crossover, also titled &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, with the original date seen in the pilot episode of &quot;The Flash&quot; having been moved up by five years as a side effect of time travel.

==In other media==
The comic book series was adapted as a novel by the original writer, Marv Wolfman. This novelization was then performed as an audio drama marketed as a &quot;Movie in Your Mind&quot; by publisher GraphicAudio.

The story serves as inspiration for &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, an Arrowverse crossover event consisting of an episode each of &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot;, &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Batwoman&quot;.

An animated film adaptation, &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, was released in three parts during 2024, beginning with &quot;Part One&quot; on January 9.

In &quot;Scooby-Doo! and Krypto, Too!&quot; while being chased by Solomon Grundy, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy climb on Flash&#x27;s Cosmic Treadmill which briefly travels them, along with Solomon Grundy, through many alternate timelines, with one of those being inspired by the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline.

==Sequels==
&quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot; is a follow-up to &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; also adheres to the continuity changes of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!&quot;.

&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; is the first installment in what became known as the &quot;Crisis&quot; trilogy. The second part of the trilogy, the seven-part &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, was written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Phil Jimenez, Pérez, Ivan Reis, and Jerry Ordway. It was published from October 2005 to June 2006, with a number of tie-in issues. In the series, Kal-L, Alexander Luthor, and Superboy-Prime escape from the pocket dimension they were left in at the end of the original series; Luthor, having gone insane, attempts to recreate the multiverse using the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s remains as a generator. Meanwhile, Superboy-Prime, having become disillusioned with the surviving Earth, engages in a destructive rampage after confronting the modern Superboy, Connor Kent. The battle culminates in the two Superboys colliding with Luthor&#x27;s multiverse generator, restoring the Earth (with slight alterations to continuity) and recreating the lost multiverse.

The conclusion to the trilogy, &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, began in May 2008 and ended in January 2009. The series was written by Grant Morrison, with art by J. G. Jones, Carlos Pacheco, Marco Rudy, and Doug Mahnke. In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Darkseid arrives on Earth and begins a conquest to overthrow reality, as part of a plan by Libra to conquer the Multiverse. The Justice League and Green Lantern Corps join forces in a desperate attempt to stop the upcoming onslaught.

In 2022, a new DC Comics Crisis event occurred, named &quot;Dark Crisis On Infinite Earths&quot; which began in June 2022 and ended in December 2022. This series was written by Joshua Williamson and art by Daniel Sampere and Alejandro Sanchez. Following the death of the Justice League in issue #75 Pariah has tasked Deathstroke and the Secret Society of Supervillains to start a Crisis Event, and using the crisis energy which would form, restart and bring back the infinite earths lost in the original Crisis. Nightwing and the Titans work to protect the world from the Secret Society, while Hal Jordan investigates the deaths of the Justice League.

<text>Jamestown Settlement is a living history museum operated by the Commonwealth of Virginia, created in 1957 as Jamestown Festival Park for the 350th anniversary celebration. Today it includes a recreation of the original James Fort (c. 1607 to 1614), a Powhatan Native American town, indoor and outdoor displays, and replicas of the original settlers&#x27; ships: the &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, and &quot;Discovery&quot;.

The museum complex is located adjacent to Historic Jamestowne, on Jamestown Island, which is run in partnership by the National Park Service and the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation, a private nonprofit branch of Preservation Virginia dedicated to the archaeological mission. Historic Jamestowne is established in the original James Fort and Jamestown Colony, the first successful English settlement on the mainland of North America, founded on May 14, 1607. Colonial Williamsburg and The American Revolution Museum in Yorktown, additional living history sites, follow the next centennial of Virginian and American history up to the American Civil War. The Colonial Parkway connects all of these sites. The Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation is a Virginia state agency that administers the education aspects of the Jamestown Settlement as well as the Yorktown battlefield and the Revolution.

==Background==
Late in the 18th century, Jamestown became the focus of renewed historical interest and efforts at preservation. In 1893, a portion of the island was donated to Preservation Virginia for that purpose, including the ruined church tower. In the early 1900s, a seawall was constructed with the intention of preserving the site around the original &quot;James Fort&quot;, even though the actual location of the original 1607 fort was thought to be underwater and lost to erosion. In 1907, the Jamestown Exposition was held to mark the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, but the celebration was held at Sewell&#x27;s Point in Norfolk, Virginia on the harbor of Hampton Roads, due to transportation and other considerations. The area came back into national prominence with the creation of the Colonial National Historical Park in 1940 and the uncovering of the old fort in 1996 by archaeologists of the Jamestown Rediscovery project.

==Jamestown Festival Park==
A return to Jamestown itself was considered feasible by 1957, in time for the 350th anniversary of the founding of the London Company settlement at Jamestown. Attractions were developed by the National Park Service and the Commonwealth of Virginia which included the reconstructed Glasshouse, the Memorial Cross, and the visitors center. The National Park Service&#x27;s Colonial Parkway was also completed in April 1957 linking the Historic Triangle of Jamestown, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, including the construction of a land bridge to Jamestown Island.

The 1956 celebrations continued from April 1 to November 30 with more than one million participants, including dignitaries and politicians such as the British Ambassador and U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon. Full-sized replicas were constructed of the three ships that brought the colonists: the &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, &quot;Godspeed&quot;, and &quot;Discovery&quot;. They were built at a shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia and relocated to nearby Glass House Point for the festival. There were nearly 25,000 visitors at the Festival Park on October 16, 1957, and the highlight for many was the visit and speech of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. Queen Elizabeth lent a copy of Magna Carta for the exhibition. Other events in 1957 included army and navy reviews, air force flyovers, ship and aircraft christenings, and an outdoor drama at Cape Henry, the site of the first landing of the settlers in April 1607.

==400th anniversary==
Jamestown Settlement facilities and programs were greatly expanded early in the 21st century as part of the Jamestown 2007 quadricentennial celebration. A special exhibition named &quot;The World of 1607&quot; was created to showcase 17th century Virginia and featured rare artifacts that were on loan from international collections and major museums. Additionally, new permanent exhibits were added while existing materials were refreshed, and a new introductory film was added. Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh were invited and attended the Jamestown Settlement on May 14, 2005 as part of a two-day royal visit to Virginia. Their itinerary included visits to the state capital in Richmond, Virginia, Colonial Williamsburg, and Historic Jamestown. Approximately 1,200 invited guests, educational groups, and members of the community were in attendance. The celebration of Jamestown was held in Jamestown, Virginia.

==Attractions==
===Galleries===
The Jamestown Settlement galleries provide the setting for a varied collection of objects relating to the nation’s beginnings in 17th-century Virginia. The Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation collection has been developed to support the museum’s storyline and includes objects representative of the Powhatan Indian, European, and African cultures that converged in 1600s Virginia. More than 500 artifacts are exhibited at any one time in the galleries.

===Living History===
In Living History, visitors can &quot;journey to the past&quot; in re-creations of a Powhatan Indian town and the 1610-14 colonial fort. The park also allows visitors to board replicas of the three ships that sailed from England to Virginia in 1607. In the outdoor areas, costumed historical interpreters describe and demonstrate daily life in early 17th-century Jamestown.

===Events===
Regular events are held to link with the colonial-related themes of the area - such as military re-enactments, historic trades fairs, lectures, or anniversaries. The next major event is the 410th Anniversary of the founding of the settlement, scheduled for mid-May 2017, entitled &quot;Jamestown Day&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Pocahontas Imagined&quot; will commemorate the 400th Anniversary of the death of Pocahontas in July 2017. Further, the American Indian Intertribal Powwow will be held there in October 2017.

===Surrounds===
On nearby Jamestown Island itself, the National Park Service and Preservation Virginia, operate Historic Jamestowne where a vast amount of artifacts have been recovered by the Jamestown Rediscovery project with ongoing archaeological work, including ongoing excavations, reconstructions, and renovations (e.g., Jamestown Church). It is also next to the Jamestown Glasshouse.

<doc id="75818" wikidata="Q6548" url="?curid=75818" title="Orléans">
<text>Orléans (; , ) is a city in north-central France, about 120 kilometres (74 miles) southwest of Paris. It is the prefecture of the department of Loiret and of the region of Centre-Val de Loire.

Orléans is located on the river Loire nestled in the heart of the Loire Valley, classified as a World Heritage Site, where the river curves south towards the Massif Central. In 2020, the city had 117,026 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries. Orléans is the center of Orléans Métropole that has a population of 290,346. The larger metropolitan area has a population of 454,208, the 20th largest in France.

The city owes its development from antiquity to the commercial exchanges resulting from the river. An important river trade port, it was the headquarters of the community of merchants frequenting the Loire. It was the capital of the Kingdom of France during the Merovingian period and played an important role in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, particularly known for the role of Joan of Arc during the siege of Orléans. Every first week of May since 1432, the city pays homage to the &quot;Maid of Orléans&quot; during the Johannic Holidays which has been listed in the inventory of intangible cultural heritage in France. One of Europe&#x27;s oldest universities was created in 1306 by Pope Clement V and re-founded in 1966 as the University of Orléans, hosting more than 20,000 students in 2019.

The Île d&#x27;Orléans in Quebec, Canada, takes its name from Orléans, as do Orléans, Ontario, Orleans, Massachusetts and the city of New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Geography==

Orléans is located in the northern bend of the Loire, which crosses from east to west. Orléans belongs to the vallée de la Loire sector between Sully-sur-Loire and Chalonnes-sur-Loire, which was in 2000 inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The capital of Orléanais, 120 kilometres southwest of Paris, is bordered to the north by the Beauce region, more specifically the Orléans Forest (French: &quot;forêt d&#x27;Orléans&quot;) and Orléans-la-Source neighbourhood, and the Sologne region to the south.

Five bridges in the city cross the Loire: Pont de l&#x27;Europe, Pont du Maréchal Joffre (also called Pont Neuf), Pont George-V (also called Pont Royal, carrying the commune tramway), Pont René-Thinat and Pont de Vierzon (rail bridge).
To the north of the Loire (&quot;rive droite&quot;) is to be found a small hill ( at the pont Georges-V, at the Place du Martroi) which gently rises to at la Croix Fleury, at the limits of Fleury-les-Aubrais. Conversely, the south (on the &quot;rive gauche&quot;) has a gentle depression to about above sea level (at Saint-Marceau) between the Loire and the Loiret, designated a &quot;zone inondable&quot; (flood-risk zone).

At the end of the 1960s, the neighbourhood was created, to the south of the original commune and separated from it by the Val d&#x27;Orléans and the river Loiret (whose source is in the Parc Floral de la Source). This quarter&#x27;s altitude varies from about .

===Climate===
Orléans experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), similar to much of central France. July, the warmest month, has an average temperature of and a high of , while January, the coldest month, has an average temperature of and an average low temperature of , although February has a lower average low than January at . The record high temperature is recorded in July, while the record low temperature of was recorded in January.

Precipitation is evenly distributed year-round, with Orléans receiving of precipitation annually. However, some months are slightly wetter than others, with the driest month receiving of rain and the wettest receiving of precipitation on average. Precipitation days vary more, with less of them in the summer months than in the other seasons. Humidity is high year-round but decreases slightly in summer. July and August only have their humidity at 72% but December has 90% humidity on average. Orléans receives 1,767.3 hours of sunshine annually, with summer being the sunniest season and winter being the least sunny season. August, receiving 224.6 hours of sunshine on average, is the sunniest month, and December, receiving 56.6 hours of sunshine on average, has the least amount of sunshine.

===The Loire and navigation===

In Orléans, the Loire is separated by a submerged dike known as the &quot;dhuis&quot; into the &quot;Grande Loire&quot; to the north, no longer navigable, and the &quot;Petite Loire&quot; to the south. This dike is just one part of a vast system of construction that previously allowed the Loire to remain navigable to this point.

The Loire was formerly an important navigation and trading route, and is at the heart of the city&#x27;s foundation in the second century BC as a center of trade or emporium. More recently, during the 17th century, the river enabled Orleans to become a major hub for refining sugar, which was imported from the Caribbean via Nantes, and whose commerce boosted other aspects of the local economy, such as sweets, chocolate manufacturing, and paper for wrapping. In the 18th century, Orleans also acquired a reputation for producing vinegar, from local vineyards as well as wine traveling up the Loire.

With the increase in size of ocean-going ships, large ships can now navigate the estuary only up to about Nantes.
Boats on the river were traditionally flat-bottomed boats, with large but foldable masts so the sails could gather wind from above the river banks, but the masts could be lowered in order to allow the boats to pass under bridges. These vessels are known as &quot;gabarre&quot;, &quot;futreau&quot;&quot;,&quot; and so on, and may be viewed by tourists near pont Royal.

The river&#x27;s irregular flow strongly limits traffic on it, in particular at its ascent, though this can be overcome by boats being given a tow.

An paddle steamer owned by the mairie was put in place in August 2007, facing Place de la Loire and containing a bar.

Every two years, the Festival de Loire recalls the role played by the river in the commune&#x27;s history.

On the river&#x27;s north bank, near the town centre, is the Canal d&#x27;Orléans, which connects to the Canal du Loing and the Canal de Briare at Buges near Montargis. The canal is no longer used along its whole length. Its route within Orléans runs parallel to the river, separated from it by a wall or &quot;muret&quot;, with a promenade along the top. Its last pound was transformed into an outdoor swimming pool in the 1960s, then filled in. It was reopened in 2007 for the &quot;fêtes de Loire.&quot; There are plans to revive use of the canal for recreation and install a pleasure-boat port there.

==History==
===Prehistory and Roman Empire===
:&quot;See also Cenabum, Aureliana Civitas.&quot;
Cenabum was a Gaul stronghold, one of the principal towns of the tribe of the Carnutes where the Druids held their annual assembly. The Carnutes were massacred and the city was destroyed by Julius Caesar in 52 BC. In the late 3rd century AD, Roman Emperor Aurelian rebuilt the city and renamed it civitas Aurelianorum (&quot;city of Aurelian&quot;) after himself. The name later evolved into Orléans.

In 442 Flavius Aetius, the Roman commander in Gaul, requested Goar, head of the Iranian tribe of Alans in the region to come to Orleans and control the rebellious natives and the Visigoths. Accompanying the Vandals, the Alans crossed the Loire in 408. One of their groups, under Goar, joined the Roman forces of Flavius Aetius to fight Attila when he invaded Gaul in 451, taking part in the Battle of Châlons under their king Sangiban. Goar established his capital in Orléans. His successors later took possession of the estates in the region between Orléans and Paris. Installed in Orléans and along the Loire, they were unruly (killing the town&#x27;s senators when they felt they had been paid too slowly or too little) and resented by the local inhabitants. Many inhabitants around the present city have names bearing witness to the Alan presence – Allaines. Also many places in the region bear names of Alan origin.

===Early Middle Ages===
In the Merovingian era, the city was capital of the Kingdom of Orléans following Clovis I&#x27;s division of the kingdom, then under the Capetians it became the capital of a county then duchy held in appanage by the house of Valois-Orléans. The Valois-Orléans family later acceded to the throne of France via Louis XII, then Francis I. In 1108, Louis VI of France became one of the few French monarchs to be crowned outside of Reims when he was crowned in Orléans cathedral by Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens.

===High Middle Ages===

The city was always a strategic point on the Loire, for it was sited at the river&#x27;s most northerly point, and thus its closest point to Paris. There were few bridges over the dangerous river Loire, but Orléans had one of them, and so became – with Rouen and Paris – one of medieval France&#x27;s three richest cities.

On the south bank the &quot;châtelet des Tourelles&quot; protected access to the bridge. This was the site of the battle on 8 May 1429 which allowed Joan of Arc to enter and lift the siege of the Plantagenets during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, with the help of the royal generals Dunois and . The city&#x27;s inhabitants have continued to remain faithful and grateful to her to this day, calling her &quot;la pucelle d&#x27;Orléans&quot; (the maid of Orléans), offering her a middle-class house in the city, and contributing to her ransom when she was taken prisoner.
===1453 to 1699===

Once the Hundred Years&#x27; War was over, the city recovered its former prosperity. The bridge brought in tolls and taxes, as did the merchants passing through the city. King Louis XI also greatly contributed to its prosperity, revitalising agriculture in the surrounding area (particularly the exceptionally fertile land around Beauce) and relaunching saffron farming at Pithiviers. Later, during the Renaissance, the city benefited from its becoming fashionable for rich châtelains to travel along the Loire valley (a fashion begun by the king himself, whose royal domains included the nearby châteaus at Chambord, Amboise, Blois, and Chenonceau).

The University of Orléans also contributed to the city&#x27;s prestige. Specializing in law, it was highly regarded throughout Europe. John Calvin was received and accommodated there (and wrote part of his reforming theses during his stay), and in return Henry VIII of England (who had drawn on Calvin&#x27;s work in his separation from Rome) offered to fund a scholarship at the university. Many other Protestants were sheltered by the city. Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, better known by his pseudonym Molière, also studied law at the University, but was expelled for attending a carnival contrary to university rules.

From 13 December 1560 to 31 January 1561, the French States-General after the death of Francis II of France, the eldest son of Catherine de Médicis and Henry II. He died in the Hôtel Groslot in Orléans, with his queen Mary at his side.

The cathedral was rebuilt several times. The present structure had its first stone laid by Henry IV, and work on it took a century. It thus is a mix of late Renaissance and early Louis XIV styles, and one of the last cathedrals to be built in France.

===1700–1900===
When France colonised America, the territory it conquered was immense, including the whole Mississippi River (whose first European name was the River Colbert), from its mouth to its source at the borders of Canada. Its capital was named &quot;la Nouvelle-Orléans&quot; in honour of Louis XV&#x27;s regent, the duke of Orléans, and was settled with French inhabitants against the threat from British troops to the north-east.

The Dukes of Orléans hardly ever visited their city since, as brothers or cousins of the king, they took such a major role in court life that they could hardly ever leave. The duchy of Orléans was the largest of the French duchies, starting at Arpajon, continuing to Chartres, Vendôme, Blois, Vierzon, and Montargis. The duke&#x27;s son bore the title &quot;duke of Chartres&quot;. Inheritances from great families and marriage alliances allowed them to accumulate huge wealth, and one of them, Philippe Égalité, is sometimes said to have been the richest man in the world at the time. His son, King Louis-Philippe I, inherited the Penthièvre and Condé family fortunes.

1852 saw the creation of the &quot;Compagnies ferroviaires Paris-Orléans&quot; and its famous gare d&#x27;Orsay in Paris. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the city again became strategically important thanks to its geographical position, and was occupied by the Prussians on 13 October that year. The &quot;armée de la Loire&quot; was formed under the orders of General d&#x27;Aurelle de Paladines and based itself not far from Orléans at Beauce.

===1900 to present===
During the Second World War, the German army made the &quot;Orléans Fleury-les-Aubrais&quot; railway station one of their central logistical rail hubs. The Pont Georges V was renamed &quot;pont des Tourelles&quot;. A transit camp for deportees was built at Beaune-la-Rolande. During the war, the American Air Force heavily bombed the city and the train station, causing much damage. The city was one of the first to be rebuilt after the war: the reconstruction plan and city improvement initiated by Jean Kérisel and Jean Royer was adopted as early as 1943, and work began as early as the start of 1945. This reconstruction in part identically reproduced what had been lost, such as Royale and its arcades, but also used innovative prefabrication techniques, such as îlot 4 under the direction of the architect Pol Abraham.

The big city of former times is today an average-sized city of 250,000 inhabitants. It is still using its strategically central position less than an hour from the French capital to attract businesses interested in reducing transport costs.

===Heraldry===

According to Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun in &quot;La France Illustrée&quot;, 1882, Orléans&#x27;s arms are &quot;gules, three caillous in &quot;cœurs de lys&quot; argent, and on a chief azure, three fleurs de lys Or.&quot; Charle Grandmaison, in the &quot;Dictionnaire Héraldique&quot; of 1861, states that it is &quot;Or, with three hearts in gules&quot;, without the chief of France. Faulty designs sometimes describe it as &quot;gules, three fleurs de lys argent, and on a chief azure three fleurs de lys Or.&quot;

The &quot;cœurs de lys&quot;, or heart of a lily, is not a true lily, which would have 6 tepals, but a stylized or symbolic lily. Certain authors solve the problem by calling this symbol a &quot;tiercefeuille&quot;, defined as a stemless clover leaf, with one leaf at the top and two below, thus making this coat of arms &quot;gules, with three reversed tiercefeuilles in argent, etc&quot;.

===Motto===
&quot;Hoc vernant lilia corde&quot; (granted by Louis XII, then duke of Orléans), meaning &quot;It is by this heart that lilies flourish&quot; or &quot;This heart makes lilies flourish&quot;, referring to the fleur de lys, symbol of the French royal family.

===Public transport===
TAO manages buses and tram lines in Orléans. The first tram line was inaugurated November 20, 2000 and the second line on June 30, 2012. The network contains 29.3 km of rail. The annual ridership was 18.46 million in 2022.
===Roads and highway===
Orléans is an autoroute intersection: the A10 (linking Paris to Bordeaux) links to the commune outskirts, and A71 (whose bridge over the Loire is outside the commune limits) begins here, heading for the Mediterranean via Clermont-Ferrand (where it becomes the A75).

==Culture==

=== Historical landmarks ===


* The Gallo-Roman town-wall on the north side of the cathedral (4th century AD) and along the rue de la Tour-Neuve
* The &quot;Hôtel Groslot&quot;, built between 1550 and 1555 for Jacques Groslot, &quot;bailli d&#x27;Orléans&quot; by Jacques Ier Androuet du Cerceau. King François II of France died there in 1560. Kings Charles IX, Henri III of France and Henri IV of France stayed there. The &quot;Hôtel&quot; was restored in 1850. The building became the town Hall of Orléans in 1790 (weddings are still celebrated inside), before the council moved to the current Hôtel de Ville in 1981.
* The &quot;hôtel de la Vieille Intendance&quot; (early 15th century) (otherwise named hôtel Brachet, formerly &quot;The King&#x27;s house&quot;), real gothic-renaissance style château made of bricks. Nowadays housing the Administrative Court of Orléans. One can admire its frontage from the entrance in the rue de la Bretonnerie. Yet, the building – which sheltered the highest figures of the kingdom passing by the city, and maybe some kings themselves (Henri IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV of France) – can easily be observed from its gardens, opened to the public (entrance rue d&#x27;Alsace-Lorraine).
* The &quot;hôtel de la Motte-Sanguin&quot; (18th century) and its gardens, manor built at the behest of Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1747–1793), cousin of the King Louis XVI. He was surnamed &quot;Philippe Égalité&quot; / &quot;equality&quot; referring to his support to the 1789 revolutionaries. Nicknamed &quot;the richest man on earth&quot; he voted in favour of the death penalty against his own cousin the king Louis XVI, and suffered the same fate himself. This is a classic style princely residence (and even royal, since Philippe Égalité&#x27;s heir accessed the throne of France under the name of Louis-Philippe Ier). It is part of a public park opened to the public (via the Solférino street).
* The &quot;school of artillery&quot;, next to the &quot;Hôtel de la Motte-Sanguin&quot; which it is often confused with, formerly housing a military school, it was built in the 19th century near the Loire.
* &quot;Remains of the University of Orléans&quot; (a 15th-century building housing the thesis room), founded in 1306 by pope Clement V, in which, among many other great historical figures, the Protestant John Calvin studied and taught. The University was so famous that it attracted students from all over Europe, particularly Germany. The city of Orléans is one of the cradles of Protestantism.
* The &quot;House of Louis XI&quot; (end of the 15th century), on Saint-Aignan square. Built at the behest of the king, who particularly revered Saint Aignan.
* The &quot;House of Joan of Arc&quot;, where she stayed during the siege of Orléans (this is actually an approximate reconstitution, the original building being bombed in 1940 during the Battle of France).
* &quot;Place du Martroi&quot;, heart of the city, with the equestrian statue of Joan of Arc at its centre, made by Denis Foyatier. This statue was damaged during the Second World War, then repaired by Paul Belmondo, father of the famous 1950s to 1980s French actor.
* Duke of Orléans&#x27; &quot;Chancellerie&quot; (XVIIIe), located next to the &quot;Place du Matroi&quot;, also bombed during the Second World War, only the frontage resisted.
* The &quot;Bannier gate-house&quot;, discovered in 1986 under the statue of Joan of Arc (Place du Martroi). It was built in the 14th century. It can be seen through a window in the subterranean car-park under the square, or visited under certain conditions.
* The &quot;rue de Bourgogne&quot; and surrounding streets, Orléans&#x27; main street since the Antiquity, it&#x27;s the former Roman decumanus, crossing the city from east to west. Joan of Arc entered the city in 1429 by the &quot;Bourgogne&quot; gatehouse situated at its Easter end. Until today it is still giving access to the &quot;Prefecture&quot;, where the &quot;Prefet&quot; (officer who represents the French State in the Region) lives, many pubs, night clubs, restaurants and shops such as the &quot;Galeries Lafayette&quot;. It is more than a mile long. One can admire many medieval houses on its sides.
* The &quot;Tour Blanche / White Tower&quot;, it is one of the only medieval defensive towers remaining in the city (still in use at the time of the siege of Orléans). It nowadays houses the city&#x27;s archaeological department.
* &quot;The Docks&quot;, (]) once the most important inland port of France (18th century). While boats could not sail on the river Seine because of the windings, they could sail to Orléans on the river Loire with the wind in their back. Then the merchandise was brought to Paris by roadways. Wine, and sugar from the colonies, were shipped to Orléans where they were stored and refined. Vinegar is still a city speciality due to the lapsing of wine stocks during the shipment. One can admire the old pavement of the docks (18th and 19th centuries) on the north bank of the river in the city and on the island in the middle, that was used to channel the water
* The &quot;Hôpital Madeleine&quot; (former hospital), built by King Louis XIV (18th century) and his successors (notably an important part of the 18th century).
* &quot;Saint-Charles&quot; chapel, located within the grounds of the Madeleine Hospital, it was built in 1713 by Jacques V Gabriel, one of Louis XIV&#x27;s architects.
* The &quot;Hôtel Cabu&quot;, otherwise named &quot;house of Diane de Poitiers&quot;, built at the behest of Philippe Cabu, barrister, in 1547, famous architect Jacques Ier Androuet du Cerceau providing the plans.
* The &quot;Hôtel Hatte&quot;, 16th century. Today&#x27;s Charles-Péguy Center.
* The &quot;Hôtel Toutin&quot;, 16th century
* The &quot;Hôtel Pommeret d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, 16th century
* The &quot;Hôtel Ducerceau&quot;, 16th century
*The &quot;maison de la coquille&quot;, 16th century
* The &quot;Hôtel des Créneaux&quot;, former city hall, flanked by its bell tower (15th century). It nowadays houses the city&#x27;s school of music. This is a magnificent piece of late gothic secular architecture (15th century) that calls to mind the famous and much more recent Parisian city hall.
* The &quot;House of Jean Dalibert&quot;, 16th century
* The &quot;Study of Jacques Bouchet&quot; (16th century), which can be admired from the public square &quot;Jacques Bouchet&quot;
* The mansions, rue d&#x27;Escure (17th and 18th centuries)
* The &quot;Préfecture&quot; : former Benedictine monastery, built in 1670 and housing the &quot;Préfecture du Loiret&quot; since 1800.
* The &quot;Pont de l&#x27;Europe&quot;, designed by Santiago Calatrava, is an inclined bow-string ark bridge particularly original.
* The &quot;Pont Royal / George V Royal bridge&quot;, the oldest bridge of the city. Built between 1751 and 1760, at the request of Daniel-Charles Trudaine, administrator and civil engineer. It was renamed in honour of King George V after the World War I out of respect of Britain&#x27;s role in the war.
* The &quot;Pont des Tourelles&quot;, built in 1140 and demolished in 1760, was the first stone-made bridge of Orléans. When the river Loire is low, one can see remains of it in the water
* The &quot;Palais épiscopal d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, former Bishop&#x27;s Palace. It was built between 1635 and 1641. Napoléon stayed there. It is nowadays housing the international centre for research, part of University of Orléans. 
* The courthouse (18th to 20th centuries)
* The &quot;salle de l&#x27;Institut&quot;, located on the &quot;place Sainte Croix&quot;, is a small concert hall which can be converted into a ballroom. Its acoustics are remarkable.
* &quot;Mansions, rue de la Bretonnerie&quot;. This street concentrates many particular mansions, of all styles and ages (15th to 20th centuries). High society members, politicians, barristers, doctors... continue to live there.
* &quot;Mansions, rue d&#x27;Alsace-Lorraine&quot;, 19th-century bourgeoisie style houses.
* Statue &quot;La Baigneuse&quot; by Paul Belmondo, aside the rue Royale (1955).
* Statue of Calvin, by Daniel Leclercq, facing the Calvinist temple (2009).
* The &quot;FRAC Centre&quot; building named &quot;Les turbulences&quot;, an advanced piece of architecture covered with L.E.Ds.
* Memorial Museum to the Children of Vel d&#x27;Hiv at the &quot;Centre d&#x27;étude et de recherche sur les camps d&#x27;internement du Loiret&quot; (Study and Research Centre on the Internment Camps in Loiret), commemorating over 4,000 Jewish children who were concentrated at the Vélodrome d´Hiver cycling arena in Paris in July 1942, after which they were interned at either Pithiviers or Beaune-la-Rolande, and eventually deported to the Auschwitz extermination camp.
* Many historical houses and mansions (hundreds) can still be admired in the city centre, which is one of the largest in France due to the great importance of the city until the 20th century. The historical centre dating back to the 15th century extends far beyond the limits of the pedestrian sector that has been extensively restored in the past few years. In fact it corresponds to the portion of the modern city which is enclosed by the Boulevards. Many historical monuments remain in the non-pedestrian sectors of the city (for example, at rue Notre-Dame-de-Recouvrance, at rue des Carmes, at rue de la Bretonnerie, at Square Saint-Aignan).

<text>Cork is an impermeable buoyant material. It is the phellem layer of bark tissue which is harvested for commercial use primarily from &quot;Quercus suber&quot; (the cork oak), which is native to southwest Europe and northwest Africa. Cork is composed of suberin, a hydrophobic substance. Because of its impermeable, buoyant, elastic, and fire retardant properties, it is used in a variety of products, the most common of which is wine stoppers.

The montado landscape of Portugal produces approximately half of the cork harvested annually worldwide, with Corticeira Amorim being the leading company in the industry. Cork was examined microscopically by Robert Hooke, which led to his discovery and naming of the cell.

Cork composition varies depending on geographic origin, climate and soil conditions, genetic origin, tree dimensions, age (virgin or reproduction), and growth conditions. However, in general, cork is made up of suberin (average of about 40%), lignin (22%), polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) (18%), extractables (15%) and others.

==History==

Cork is a natural material used by humans for over 5,000 years. It is a material whose applications have been known since antiquity, especially in floating devices and as stopper for beverages, mainly wine, whose market, from the early twentieth century, had a massive expansion, particularly due to the development of several cork-based agglomerates.

In China, Egypt, Babylon, and Persia from about 3000 BC, cork was already used for sealing containers, fishing equipment, and domestic applications. In ancient Greece (1600 to 1100 years BC) cork was used in footwear, to manufacture a type of sandals attached to the foot by straps, generally leather and with a sole in cork or leather.

In the second century AD, a Greek physician, Dioscorides, noted several medical applications of cork, mainly for hair loss treatment. Nowadays, the majority of people know cork for its use as stoppers in wine bottles. The innovation of using cork as stopper can be traced back to the late 17th century, attributed to Dom Pierre Pérignon. Cork stoppers were adopted in 1729 by Ruinart and in 1973 by Moët et Chandon.

==Structure==
Cork presents a characteristic structure in which the cells have usually a pentagonal or hexagonal shape. The cellular wall consists of a thin, lignin-rich middle lamella (internal primary wall), a thick secondary wall made up from alternating suberin and wax lamella, and a thin tertiary wall of polysaccharides. Some studies suggest that the secondary wall is lignified, and therefore, may not consist exclusively of suberin and waxes. The cells of cork are filled with a gas mixture similar to air, making them behave as authentic &quot;pads,&quot; which contributes to the capability of cork to recover after compression.

==Sources==

There are about 2,200,000 hectares of cork oak &quot;(Quercus suber)&quot; forest in the Mediterranean basin, the native area of the species. The most extensively managed habitats are in Portugal (34%) and in Spain (27%).
Annual production is about 300,000 tons; 49.6% from Portugal, 30.5% from Spain, 5.8% from Morocco, 4.9% from Algeria, 3.5% from Tunisia, 3.1% from Italy, and 2.6% from France.
Once the trees are about 25 years old the cork is traditionally stripped from the trunks every nine years, with the first two harvests generally producing lower quality cork (&quot;male cork&quot; or &quot;virgin cork&quot;). The trees live for about 300 years.

The cork industry is generally regarded as environmentally friendly. Cork production is generally considered sustainable because the cork tree is not cut down to obtain cork; only the bark is stripped to harvest the cork. The tree continues to live and grow. The sustainability of production and the easy recycling of cork products and by-products are two of its most distinctive aspects. Cork oak forests also prevent desertification and are a particular habitat in the Iberian Peninsula and the refuge of various endangered species.

Carbon footprint studies conducted by Corticeira Amorim, Oeneo Bouchage of France and the Cork Supply Group of Portugal concluded that cork is the most environmentally friendly wine stopper in comparison to other alternatives. The Corticeira Amorim&#x27;s study, in particular (&quot;Analysis of the life cycle of Cork, Aluminum and Plastic Wine Closures&quot;), was developed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, according to ISO 14040. Results concluded that, concerning the emission of greenhouse gases, each plastic stopper released 10 times more CO2, whilst an aluminium screw cap releases 26 times more CO2 than does a cork stopper. For example, to produce 1,000 cork stoppers 1.5 kg are emitted, but to produce the same amount of plastic stoppers 14 kg of are emitted and for the same amount of aluminium screw caps 37 kg are emitted.

The Chinese cork oak is native to East Asia and is cultivated in a limited extent in China; the cork produced is considered inferior to &quot;Q. suber&quot; and are used to produce agglomerated cork products.

The so-called &quot;cork trees&quot; &quot;(Phellodendron)&quot; are unrelated to the cork oak, they have corky bark but not thick enough for cork production.

==Harvesting==

Cork is extracted only from early May to late August, when the cork can be separated from the tree without causing permanent damage. When the tree reaches 25–30 years of age and about 24 in (60 cm) in circumference, the cork can be removed for the first time. However, this first harvest almost always produces poor quality or &quot;virgin&quot; cork (Portuguese ; Spanish or ).

The workers who specialize in removing the cork are known as &quot;extractors&quot;. An extractor uses a very sharp axe to make two types of cuts on the tree: one horizontal cut around the plant, called a &quot;crown&quot; or &quot;necklace&quot;, at a height of about two to three times the circumference of the tree, and several vertical cuts called &quot;rulers&quot; or &quot;openings&quot;. This is the most delicate phase of the work because, even though cutting the cork requires significant force, the extractor must not damage the underlying phellogen or the tree will be harmed.

To free the cork from the tree, the extractor pushes the handle of the axe into the rulers. A good extractor needs to use a firm but precise touch in order to free a large amount of cork without damaging the product or tree.

These freed portions of the cork are called &quot;planks&quot;. The planks are usually carried off by hand since cork forests are rarely accessible to vehicles. The cork is stacked in piles in the forest or in yards at a factory and traditionally left to dry, after which it can be loaded onto a truck and shipped to a processor.

Bark from initial harvests can be used to make flooring, shoes, insulation and other industrial products. Subsequent extractions usually occur at intervals of nine years, though it can take up to thirteen for the cork to reach an acceptable size. If the product is of high quality it is known as &quot;gentle&quot; cork (Portuguese , but also only if it is the second time; Spanish , also restricted to the second time), and, ideally, is used to make stoppers for wine and champagne bottles.

==Properties and uses==

Cork&#x27;s elasticity combined with its near-impermeability makes it suitable as a material for bottle stoppers, especially for wine bottles. Cork stoppers represent about 60% of all cork based production. Cork has an almost zero Poisson&#x27;s ratio, which means the radius of a cork does not change significantly when squeezed or pulled.

Cork is an excellent gasket material. Some carburetor float bowl gaskets are made of cork, for example.

Cork is also an essential element in the production of badminton shuttlecocks.

Cork&#x27;s bubble-form structure and natural fire retardant make it suitable for acoustic and thermal insulation in house walls, floors, ceilings, and facades. The by-product of more lucrative stopper production, corkboard, is gaining popularity as a non-allergenic, easy-to-handle and safe alternative to petrochemical-based insulation products.

Cork is also used to make vinyl record slipmats, due to its ability to not attract dust. They also dampen static and vibrations.

Sheets of cork, also often the by-product of stopper production, are used to make bulletin boards as well as floor and wall tiles.

Cork&#x27;s low density makes it a suitable material for fishing floats and buoys, as well as handles for fishing rods (as an alternative to neoprene).

Granules of cork can also be mixed into concrete. The composites made by mixing cork granules and cement have lower thermal conductivity, lower density, and good energy absorption. Some of the property ranges of the composites are density (400–1500 kg/m3), compressive strength (1–26 MPa), and flexural strength (0.5–4.0 MPa).

===Use in wine bottling===

As late as the mid-17th century, French vintners did not use cork stoppers, using instead oil-soaked rags stuffed into the necks of bottles.

Wine corks can be made of either a single piece of cork, or composed of particles, as in champagne corks; corks made of granular particles are called &quot;agglomerated corks&quot;.

Natural cork closures are used for about 80% of the 20 billion bottles of wine produced each year. After a decline in use as wine-stoppers due to the increase in the use of synthetic alternatives, cork wine-stoppers are making a comeback and currently represent approximately 60% of wine-stoppers in 2016.
Because of the cellular structure of cork, it is easily compressed upon insertion into a bottle and will expand to form a tight seal. The interior diameter of the neck of glass bottles tends to be inconsistent, making this ability to seal through variable contraction and expansion an important attribute. However, unavoidable natural flaws, channels, and cracks in the bark make the cork itself highly inconsistent. In a 2005 closure study, 45% of corks showed gas leakage during pressure testing both from the sides of the cork as well as through the cork body itself.
Since the mid-1990s, a number of wine brands have switched to alternative wine closures such as plastic stoppers, screw caps, or other closures. During 1972 more than half of the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium &quot;Stelvin&quot; cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Stelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Stelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps.
The alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a trichloroanisole (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine. TCA is the main documented cause of cork taint in wine. However, some in the wine industry say natural cork stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age.

Stoppers which resemble natural cork very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable lignin, mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a standardized product, free of TCA or other undesirable substances. Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines. Celebrated Australian wine writer and critic James Halliday has written that since a cork placed inside the neck of a wine bottle is 350-year-old technology, it is logical to explore other more modern and precise methods of keeping wine safe.

The study &quot;Analysis of the life cycle of Cork, Aluminum and Plastic Wine Closures,&quot; conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and commissioned by a major cork manufacturer, Amorim, concluded that cork is the most environmentally responsible stopper, in a one-year life cycle analysis comparison with plastic stoppers and aluminum screw caps.

===Other uses===

* On 28 November 2007, the Portuguese national postal service CTT issued the world&#x27;s first postage stamp made of cork.
* In musical instruments, particularly woodwind instruments, where it is used to fasten together segments of the instrument, making the seams airtight. Low quality conducting baton handles are also often made out of cork.
* In shoes, especially those using welt construction to improve climate control and comfort.
* Because it is impermeable and moisture-resistant, cork is often used as an alternative to leather in handbags, wallets, and other fashion items.
* To make bricks for the outer walls of houses, as in Portugal&#x27;s pavilion at Expo 2000.
* As the core of both baseballs and cricket balls. A corked bat is made by replacing the interior of a baseball bat with cork – a practice known as &quot;corking&quot;. It was historically a method of cheating at baseball; the of the practice is now discredited.
* In various forms, in spacecraft heat shields and fairings.
* In the paper pick-up mechanisms in inkjet and laser printers.
* To make later-model pith helmets.
* Hung from hats to keep insects away. (&quot;See &quot;cork hat)
* As a core material in sandwich composite construction.
* As the friction lining material of an automatic transmission clutch, as designed in certain mopeds.
* Alternative of wood or aluminium in automotive interiors.
* Cork slabs are sometimes used by orchid growers as a natural mounting material.
* Cork paddles are used by glass blowers to manipulate and shape hot molten glass.

<doc id="75824" wikidata="Q381963" url="?curid=75824" title="Kevin Smith (New Zealand actor)">
<text>Kevin Tod Smith (16 March 1963 – 15 February 2002) was a New Zealand actor and musician, best known for starring as the Greek God of war, Ares, in the TV series &quot;&quot; and in its two spin-offs – &quot;&quot; and &quot;Young Hercules&quot;.

== Early life ==
Kevin Smith was born in Auckland in 1963. His mother was of Tongan and German ancestry and his father (of English descent) hailed from New Zealand. Smith&#x27;s family moved to the South Island town of Timaru when he was eleven. He attended Timaru Boys&#x27; High School from 1976 to 1979. He was involved in the drama club at his high school.

Smith played in rock and roll bands during high school, working out each morning at the gym and watching television in the afternoon. He painted and played rugby and hoped to become a member of New Zealand&#x27;s world-famous rugby team, the All Blacks.

At the age of 17, Smith moved to Christchurch, where he lived in a flat above a fruit shop, worked at various jobs, and considered joining the police to help children, before enrolling in Canterbury University at the age of 20. In 1986, he married his high school sweetheart, Suzanne (Sue), with whom he had three sons: Oscar, Tyrone, and Willard.

== Career ==
Smith played in several lo-fi experimental bands in New Zealand and released a few albums with Say Yes to Apes and Hyphen-Ears in the mid-1980s.

After suffering a concussion while playing university rugby union in 1987, Smith was forced to sit on the sidelines for almost three weeks. His wife saw a casting call advertisement for the touring musical tribute to Elvis Presley, &quot;Are You Lonesome Tonight&quot;, and signed up Kevin for an audition. He got the role of bodyguard JoJoe and was the lead understudy. Later that year, Smith joined Christchurch&#x27;s Court Theatre and performed on stage for the next three years in a variety of roles including Don Pedro in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

In 1989, Smith co-founded a Christchurch theatresports group, Scared Scriptless, performing live comedy. Later that year he got the role of charming &quot;bad boy&quot; Demian Vermeer on the New Zealand primetime soap opera &quot;Gloss&quot;, and moved to Auckland to work on the series&#x27; final season.

In 1993, Smith played Lawrence Hayes in &quot;Desperate Remedies&quot;. He then appeared as Paul Cosic in the last two seasons of the primetime drama &quot;Marlin Bay&quot;. For this role, he won the 1995 New Zealand Film and Television Award for Best Supporting Actor.

He screen-tested for the lead role in Paramount&#x27;s big budget action-film &quot;The Phantom&quot;, but the role ultimately went to Billy Zane instead. His fellow &quot;&quot; cast member, low-budget-movie actor and Pacific Renaissance Pictures partner Bruce Campbell, was also one of the contenders for the role of the legendary superhero.

Also in 1995, Smith appeared on &quot;&quot; as Hercules&#x27; half-brother, Iphicles. Later he joined the cast of &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot;, as Ares, a role he would later play on &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Young Hercules&quot; as well. As the dark and dangerously seductive Greek god of war, Smith gained legions of fans. During this time Kevin performed as Ares on &quot;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys&quot;, &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess&quot; and &quot;Young Hercules&quot; simultaneously.

While starring on &quot;Xena&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot; and &quot;Young Hercules&quot;, Smith also appeared in other TV shows and films, notably as a Vietnam veteran in the feature film &quot;Channelling Baby&quot; and as detective John Lawless in three TV movies: &quot;Lawless&quot; (1999), &quot;Lawless 2: Dead Evidence&quot; (2000), and &quot;Lawless 3: Beyond Justice&quot; (2001). In the mockumentary &quot;Love Mussel&quot; (2001) he played himself covering the story of a small town in New Zealand following the discovery that a local shellfish, the geoduck, has similar effects to Viagra.

Smith also continued to act in the theatre. During his career, he also appeared on several cassettes of alternative music, alongside other musicians, under the band names &quot;The Picnic Boys&quot; and &quot;Say Yes to Apes&quot; which was later renamed &quot;Hyphen-Smythe&quot;. He was one of the lead singers of the celebrity band &quot;The Wide Lapels&quot;, a band famous for its campy performances of the worst songs of the 1970s.

==Death==
Early in 2002, Smith (who was preparing for his first Hollywood role in the Bruce Willis action film &quot;Tears of the Sun&quot;) went to China to shoot the US-Chinese martial arts film &quot;Warriors of Virtue 2&quot;.

On 6 February 2002, Smith completed his work on the set in Shijiazhuang, 270 km southwest of Beijing. After celebrating with staff from Beijing Film Studio, and while waiting for a ride back to the hotel, he decided to walk around the China Central Television film studio grounds, and climbed a prop tower on the set of another film. He lost his footing and fell three stories, suffering severe head injuries. Smith was rushed by staff to a local hospital, then transferred to Beijing. He lapsed into a coma and was kept on life support for ten days until life support was discontinued. He died on 15 February without regaining consciousness.

Smith was buried after a private funeral on 28 February 2002. The launch of the Kevin Smith Trust for Smith&#x27;s children was announced later that day at a memorial service attended by old friends, New Zealand&#x27;s acting community, and over a thousand mourners at the Aotea Centre, Auckland.

A television documentary celebrating Smith&#x27;s life and career, &quot;Remembering Kev: A Tribute to Kevin Smith&quot;, aired on TV2 on the first anniversary of his death.

<text>The Thing (Benjamin Jacob &quot;Ben&quot; Grimm) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. The Thing was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and he first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1961).

Known for his trademark rocky appearance, he has superhuman strength, a sense of humor, and the battle cry and catchphrase &quot;It&#x27;s clobberin&#x27; time!&quot; Thing&#x27;s speech patterns are loosely based on Jimmy Durante. A key feature throughout his character arc has him struggling to accept his newfound powers, which often culminates in his returning to his human form before going back to his mutated form.

The Thing notably appeared in other media, including live-action films, with Michael Bailey Smith and Carl Ciarfalio playing the character in his human and mutated forms respectively in the unreleased film &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;. Michael Chiklis played the character in the 2005 &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; film and its 2007 sequel &quot;Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer&quot;, and Jamie Bell in the 2015 reboot.

Ebon Moss-Bachrach will portray the character in the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;The Fantastic Four: First Steps&quot; (2025), &quot;&quot; (2026), and &quot;&quot; (2027).

==Publication history==

Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #1 (Nov. 1961). Kirby modeled the character after himself.

In addition to appearing in the Fantastic Four, the Thing has been the star of &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot;, &quot;Strange Tales&quot; (with his fellow Fantastic Four member the Human Torch), and two incarnations of his own eponymous series, as well as numerous miniseries and one-shots.

===&quot;Strange Tales&quot;===
The Thing joined his Fantastic Four partner and frequent rival the Human Torch in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #124 (1964), which previously featured solo adventures of the Human Torch and backup Doctor Strange stories. The change was intended to liven the comic through the always humorous chemistry between the Torch and the Thing. They were replaced in #135 (1965) with the &quot;modern-day&quot; version of Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., who had already been appearing in &quot;Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos&quot;.
===&quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; (1974–1983)===
After a 1973 try-out in two issues of &quot;Marvel Feature&quot;, the Thing starred in the long-running series &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot;. In each issue, Ben Grimm would team up with another character from the Marvel Universe, often an obscure or colorful character. The series helped to introduce characters from Marvel&#x27;s lineup, by way of teaming up with the more recognizable Thing. In 1992, Marvel reprinted four &quot;Two-in-One&quot; stories (#50, 51, 77 and 80) as a miniseries under the title &quot;The Adventures of the Thing&quot;. The series was cancelled after 100 issues and seven &quot;Annual&quot;s to make way for a solo series.

===&quot;The Thing&quot; (1983–1986)===
The cancellation of &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; led to the Thing&#x27;s first completely solo series, which ran for 36 issues. &quot;The Thing&quot; was originally written by John Byrne and later, Mike Carlin. The series also featured art by Ron Wilson and later by Paul Neary. It elaborated on Ben Grimm&#x27;s poor childhood on Yancy Street in its early issues, and chronicled the Thing&#x27;s later foray into the world of professional wrestling. It also featured a major storyline offshoot from Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event, in which the Thing elects to remain on the Beyonder&#x27;s Battleworld after discovering that the planet enables him to return to human form at will. A full third of the series&#x27; stories take place on Battleworld.

===2002–present===
In 2002, Marvel released &quot;The Thing: Freakshow&quot;, a four-issue miniseries written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Scott Kolins, in which the Thing travels across the United States by train, inadvertently stumbling upon a deformed gypsy boy he once ridiculed as a teenager, who is now the super-strong main attraction of a troupe of traveling circus freaks. He later discovers a town full of alien Kree and Skrull warriors fighting over a Watcher infant.

In 2003, Marvel released a four-issue miniseries written by Evan Dorkin and illustrated by Dean Haspiel, &quot;The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street&quot;. The story was more character-driven than the stories that usually feature the Thing. Tom Spurgeon found its outlook on relationships &quot;depressing&quot;.

After the success of the 2005 &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; feature film and events in the comics series that resulted in Grimm becoming a millionaire, the Thing was once again given his own series in 2005, &quot;The Thing&quot;, written by Dan Slott and penciled by Andrea Di Vito and Kieron Dwyer. It was canceled with issue #8 in 2006.

The Thing was a member of The New Avengers, when that team debuted in their self-titled second series in 2010. He appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 &quot;New Avengers&quot; series, from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through its final issue #34 (Jan. 2013).

The Thing had another solo series in 2021, written by Walter Mosely and illustrated by Tom Reilly, which lasted for six issues. A new limited series, &quot;Clobberin&#x27; Time&quot;, was launched in 2023, written and illustrated by Steve Skroce. The series sees Thing teaming up with various heroes.

==Fictional character biography==
===Background===
Born on Yancy Street in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side, to a Jewish family, Benjamin Jacob &quot;Ben&quot; Grimm has an early life of poverty and hardship, shaping him into a tough, streetwise scrapper. His older brother Daniel, whom Ben idolizes, is killed in a street gang fight when Ben is eight years old. This portion of his own life is modeled on that of Jack Kirby, who grew up on tough Delancey Street, whose brother died when he was young, whose father was named Benjamin, and who was named Jacob at birth. Following the death of his parents, Ben is raised by his Uncle Jake (who married a much younger wife, Petunia, who becomes a frequent reference used by the character until her death). He comes to lead the Yancy Street gang at one point.

Excelling in football as a high school student, Ben receives a full scholarship to Empire State University, where he first meets his eventual lifelong friend in a teenaged genius named Reed Richards, as well as future enemy Victor von Doom. Despite their being from radically different backgrounds, science student Richards describes to Grimm his dream of building a space rocket to explore the regions of space around Mars; Grimm jokingly agrees to fly that rocket when the day comes.

The details of his life story have been modified over the decades. Prior to the stories published in the 1970s, Grimm, after earning multiple advanced degrees in engineering, serves in the United States Marine Corps as a test pilot during World War II. These exploits are chronicled to a limited extent in &quot;Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders&quot; #7. While in the military, Nick Fury sends him, Logan, and Carol Danvers to Vladivostok on a secret surveillance mission. Following this, he becomes an astronaut for NASA, taking part in attempts to reach the Moon, occurring at a time before any crewed spaceship had escaped Earth&#x27;s gravity.

====Religion====
In keeping with an early taboo in the comic superhero world against revealing a character&#x27;s religion, the fact that Grimm is Jewish was not explicitly revealed until four decades after his creation, in the story &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot; in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; vol. 3, #56 (Aug. 2002). In this story, Grimm returns to his old neighborhood to find Mr. Sheckerberg, a pawn shop owner he knew as a child. Flashbacks during this story reveal Grimm&#x27;s Jewish heritage. He recites the Shema, an important and oft-recited Jewish prayer (which, translated to English, begins &quot;Hear, O Israel&quot;) over the dying Sheckerberg, who eventually recovers. In a later story, Grimm celebrates his Bar Mitzvah, since it has been 13 years, the age a Jewish boy celebrates his Bar Mitzvah, since he began his &quot;second life&quot; as the Thing. To celebrate the ceremony, he organizes a poker tournament and invites every available superhero.

In the 2004 &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; story &quot;Hereafter Part 1: A Glimpse of God&quot;, the Thing is killed by an energy weapon wielded by Reed Richards, but is resurrected by God.

Out of universe, Jack Kirby featured the Thing on his family&#x27;s 1976 Hanukkah card.

===The Thing===
Some years later, Reed Richards, now a successful scientist, once again makes contact with Grimm. Richards has built his spaceship, and reminds Grimm of his promise to fly it. After the government denies him permission to fly the spaceship himself, Richards plots a clandestine flight piloted by Grimm and accompanied by his future wife Susan Storm, who had helped provide funding for the rocket, and her younger brother Johnny Storm, who helped the group gain access to the launch system. Although reluctant to fly the rocket, Ben is persuaded to do so by Sue, for whom he has a soft spot. During this unauthorized ride into the upper atmosphere of Earth and the Van Allen Belts, they are pelted by a cosmic ray storm and exposed to radiation against which the ship&#x27;s shields are no protection. Upon crashing down to Earth, each of the four learn that they have developed fantastic superhuman abilities. Grimm&#x27;s skin is transformed into a thick, lumpy orange hide, which gradually evolves into his now-familiar craggy covering of large rocky plates. Richards proposes the quartet band together to use their new abilities for the betterment of humanity, and Grimm, in a moment of self-pity, adopts the super-heroic sobriquet, &quot;the Thing&quot;. The team clashes with the Mole Man in their first appearance.

Trapped in his monstrous form, Grimm is an unhappy yet reliable member of the team. He trusts in his friend Reed Richards to one day develop a cure for his condition. However, when he encounters blind sculptor Alicia Masters, Grimm develops an unconscious resistance to being transformed back to his human form. Subconsciously fearing that Masters prefers him to remain in the monstrous form of the Thing, Grimm&#x27;s body rejects various attempts by Richards to restore his human form, lest he lose Masters&#x27; love. Grimm has remained a stalwart member of the Fantastic Four for years. The Thing first fought the Hulk early in his career, with many such further clashes over the years. Not long after that, he is first reverted to his human form, but is then restored to his Thing form to battle Doctor Doom.

Grimm has been temporarily replaced on the team twice. First, after Grimm temporarily lost his powers and reverted to human form, Reed Richards hired Luke Cage (then using the code name &quot;Power Man&quot;) to take his place until Richards had completed a Thing-suit for Ben (however, Ben unexpectedly reverted into the actual Thing again later on).

Years later, after Grimm chose to remain on Battleworld in the aftermath of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; due to his apparent control over his transformation between his human and mutated states, he asked the She-Hulk to fill in for him. Mister Fantastic did leave him with the device needed to return to Earth when it comes time. The Thing&#x27;s time on Battleworld lasted until Ben eventually decides to return home after defeating Ultron and slaying his manifested dark side Grimm the Sorcerer. Once he left, the planet had no more reason to exist and so it broke apart.

On returning to Earth, he learns that Alicia had become romantically involved with his teammate Johnny Storm during his absence (it is eventually revealed that this Alicia was the Skrull impostor Lyja). An angry Grimm wallows in self-pity for a time, later on accompanying the West Coast Avengers, and actually joining the team for a while. Eventually, he returns to his surrogate family as leader of the Fantastic Four when Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman leave the team to raise their son Franklin, at which point Ben invites Crystal and Ms. Marvel II (Sharon Ventura) to fill their slots. Soon after Sharon and Ben are irradiated with cosmic rays, Sharon becomes the She-Thing, lumpy much like Ben was in his first few appearances, while Ben mutates into a new rockier, more powerful form.

After being further mutated into the more monstrous rocky form, Ben is briefly changed back to his human form, and returned leadership of the Fantastic Four to Reed Richards. Grimm once more returned to his traditional orange rocky form out of love for Ms. Marvel. He remains a steadfast member of the Fantastic Four.

===In the 21st century===
In a &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; comic published in 2005, Ben learns that he is entitled to a large sum of money, his share of the Fantastic Four fortune, which Reed Richards had never touched, as he had the shares of the other teammates (who were family members) to pay off various debts of the group.

The Thing uses his newfound wealth to build a community center in his old neighborhood on Yancy Street, the &quot;Grimm Youth Center&quot;. Thinking the center is named after the Thing himself, the Yancy Street Gang plans to graffiti the building exterior, but discovers the building was actually named after Daniel Grimm, Ben&#x27;s deceased older brother and former leader of the gang. The relationship between the Yancy Streeters and the Thing is then effectively reconciled, or at least changed to a more good-natured, playful rivalry (as exemplified by the comic ending, with the Yancy Streeters spray-painting the sleeping Thing).

Some personality traits of the cantankerously lovable, occasionally cigar-smoking, Jewish native of the Lower East Side are popularly recognized as having been inspired by those of co-creator Jack Kirby, who in interviews has said he intended Grimm to be an alter ego of himself.

===Civil War/The Initiative===
Initially in the 2006 storyline &quot;Civil War&quot;, Ben is a reluctant member of the pro-registration side of the controversy over the 2006 Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA), until he witnesses a battle on Yancy Street in which Captain America&#x27;s forces try to rescue captured allies held by Iron Man&#x27;s forces. The Fantastic Four&#x27;s foes the Mad Thinker and the Puppet Master try to escalate the battle, using a mind-controlled Yancy Streeter to deliver a bomb. The young man dies and the Thing verbally blasts both sides for not caring about the civilians caught in the conflict. He announces that, while he thinks the registration is wrong, he is also not going to fight the government and is thus leaving the country for France. While in France, he meets &quot;Les Héros de Paris&quot; (The Heroes of Paris).

Ben returns to New York as both sides of the SHRA battle in the city. Indifferent to choosing sides, Ben focuses on protecting civilians from harm.

In &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #543 (March 2007), Ben celebrates the Fantastic Four&#x27;s 11th anniversary along with the Human Torch, and latecomers Reed and Sue. The aftermath of the Civil War is still being felt in this issue, as Ben and Johnny (and even Franklin) consider the future of the team and Reed and Sue&#x27;s marriage. When Reed and Sue arrive near the issue&#x27;s end, they announce that they are taking a break from the team and have found two replacement members: the Black Panther, and Storm of the X-Men. The title of the story in this issue is a quote from Ben, &quot;Come on, Suzie, don&#x27;t leave us hangin&#x27;.&quot;

Ben Grimm served as one of the pallbearers at the memorial service for Captain America, along with Tony Stark, Ms. Marvel, Rick Jones, T&#x27;Challa and Sam Wilson.

Ben has been identified as Number 53 of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book &quot;&quot; #1.

===&quot;World War Hulk&quot;===
Ben once again tries to take on the Hulk within the events of the 2007 storyline &quot;World War Hulk&quot; to buy Reed Richards the time he needs to complete his plans for the Hulk. Ben gives his best shots, but the Hulk takes his punches without slowing down. The Hulk proceeds to knock out Ben by punching both sides of his head simultaneously. He is later seen captive in Madison Square Garden, which the Hulk has turned into a gladiatorial arena, with an obedience disk fitted on him.

Released from his imprisonment, Ben, Spider-Man, and Luke Cage attack the Warbound, with Ben fighting Korg. Their battle is brought to an abrupt end when Hiroim repairs the damage to Manhattan Island, drawing the energy to do so from Ben and Korg.

===Secret Invasion===
In the &quot;Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four&quot; miniseries, the Skrull Lyja, posing as Sue, sends the Baxter Building, with Ben, Johnny, Franklin, and Valeria inside, into the Negative Zone. Not long after their arrival, Ben has to protect Franklin and Valeria from an impending onslaught of giant insects. With the aid of the Tinkerer, who Ben broke out of the Negative Zone Prison, they, with the exception of Lyja who stayed behind, were able to return to the regular Marvel Universe just after the invasion was over.

===Heroic Age===
Following the Siege of Asgard, Luke Cage asks Ben to serve on his Avengers team. Although Ben states that his loyalty will always be to the Fantastic Four, Cage confirms that he is not asking Ben to resign from his original team, merely suggesting that Ben split his time between the two teams, as Wolverine divides his time between the X-Men and the Avengers.

===&quot;Fear Itself&quot;===
During the 2011 &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Ben lifts one of the seven fallen hammers of the Serpent and becomes Angrir: Breaker of Souls. In this form, he then destroys Yancy Street and Avengers Tower, and battles Spider-Man, Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman, before confronting Thor, who seriously wounds him. Franklin then uses his powers to restore Ben to his normal self, free from the Serpent&#x27;s possession.

===&quot;Original Sin&quot;===
In the 2014 &quot;Original Sin&quot; storyline, after learning from the eye of the murdered Uatu that Johnny Storm unintentionally sabotaged an experiment that could have allowed Grimm to become human again, Ben is found having apparently murdered the Puppet Master; the crime was committed in a sealed room that even Reed Richards could barely penetrate, with Alicia Masters as the only witness. Although Ben claims innocence, his depression over recent events prompts him to accept incarceration in the Raft. Although power-dampeners in the Raft restrict his strength to a more manageable level, he is attacked by various other thick-skinned superhumans — including the Armadillo and Ironclad — on orders of the current &#x27;boss&#x27; of the prison, Sharon Ventura, the She-Thing. Eventually, Ben forms an alliance with the Sandman and manages to escape the prison with the aid of a plan coordinated by the She-Hulk and Ant-Man, allowing him to rejoin Sue and Johnny to investigate Reed&#x27;s recent abduction, revealing that the dead Puppet Master came from the alternate Earth Franklin had created.

===Post-Secret Wars===
As the Fantastic Four disbanded in the aftermath of the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, the Thing is working with the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Human Torch is acting as an ambassador with the Inhumans and becoming part of the Uncanny Avengers.

During the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, the Thing appears as a member of the Underground, which is a resistance movement against HYDRA ever since they took over the United States, until the real Captain America returns, ending HYDRA&#x27;s empires and defeating his HYDRA counterpart.

===Fantastic Four Return===
To help the Thing cope with Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman&#x27;s disappearance, the Human Torch takes him on a journey through the Multiverse, using the Multisect to find them. They have not been able to find Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, as they return to Earth-616 empty-handed. The Thing and the Human Torch were reunited with Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman to help alongside other superheroes who were part of the Fantastic Four (including X-Men member Iceman) fight the Griever at the End of All Things after Mister Fantastic persuaded the Griever to let him summon the Thing and the Human Torch. As the Thing and his teammates finally return to 616, while the Future Foundation stays behind to keep learning about the Multiverse, the Thing reveals to them that he and Alicia proposed their wedding and are about to get married soon. Although the Baxter Building is now owned by a new superhero team, Fantastix, the Thing allows his teammates to use his hometown in Yancy Street as their current operation base.

==Relationships==
The Thing is generally well liked by other heroes within the Marvel Universe. Grimm&#x27;s relationship with his teammates has been a close but occasionally edgy one given his temper. He and Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) often argue and clash but they do respect each other.

Grimm&#x27;s first love interest is the blind Alicia Masters, and he is intensely protective of her. When Johnny starts a relationship of his own with Alicia and they become engaged, Grimm is upset. However, he has to concede that, unlike himself and his stone-covered body, Johnny can &quot;be a man&quot;. He agrees to act as best man at their wedding. The relationship between Alicia and Johnny ends with the revelation that the Alicia that Johnny fell in love with is actually Lyja, a member of the shape-changing alien race known as the Skrulls. The real Alicia, who was kept in suspended animation, is rescued by the Fantastic Four and reunited with the Thing.

Ben begins dating a teacher named Debbie Green. Ben soon asks Debbie to marry him, which she accepts. He later leaves her at the altar when he realizes the dangers of the wives of superheroes.

Ben and Alicia, on the other hand, do get married, despite an attack by Galactus. Later, in the aftermath of conflict between the Kree, the Skrulls and the Cotati, Ben and Alicia adopt two orphans, Kree boy Jo-Venn and Skrull girl N&#x27;Kala.

Grimm is best friends with Reed Richards, whom he addresses with the nickname &quot;Stretch&quot;, due to Richards&#x27; natural height and his ability to stretch his body. However, Grimm also holds Reed responsible for his condition, since Richards had dismissed the potential danger of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers, although Grimm had taken them very seriously. At times of real frustration towards Reed, Grimm refers to him simply as &quot;Richards&quot;.

Grimm is the godfather of Reed and Sue&#x27;s son Franklin, who affectionately calls him &quot;Unca Ben&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==

The Thing&#x27;s primary superhuman power is his great physical strength. Over the years, as a result of further mutation and rigorous training on machines designed by Reed Richards, his strength has increased dramatically.

He is capable of surviving impacts of great force without sustaining injury, as his body is covered with an orange, flexible, rock-like hide. He is also able to withstand gunfire from high-caliber weapons as well as armor-piercing rounds. It is possible to breach his exterior, however, and he does bleed as a result. One such instance involved Wolverine&#x27;s adamantium claws scarring The Thing&#x27;s face.

The Thing&#x27;s highly advanced musculature generates fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him superhuman levels of stamina. When in his Thing form, he has only four fingers on each hand and four toes on each foot. The loss of one digit of each hand and foot, aside from the increase in volume of the remainder, does not affect his manual dexterity. However, he has been shown doing things like holding a pencil and using it to dial a phone (even with rotary dials), or to push buttons on a keypad, to use devices that would ordinarily be too small for him.

Although he very rarely does so, the Thing is capable of performing super-human leaps several stories high.

Aside from his physical attributes, the Thing&#x27;s senses can withstand higher levels of sensory stimulation than an ordinary human, with the exception of his sense of touch. His lungs are possessed of greater efficiency and volume than those of an ordinary human. As a result, the Thing is capable of holding his breath for much longer periods of time.

The Thing is an exceptionally skilled pilot, due to his time spent as a test pilot in the United States Marine Corps and as a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is also a formidable and relentless hand-to-hand combatant. His fighting style incorporates elements of boxing, wrestling, judo, jujitsu, and street-fighting techniques, as well as hand-to-hand combat training from the military.

On occasion, when Ben Grimm regained his human form and lost his Thing powers, he used a suit of powered battle armor designed by Reed Richards that simulated the strength and durability of his mutated body, albeit to a weaker degree. Wearing the suit, which was designed to physically resemble his rocky form, Ben continued to participate in the Fantastic Four&#x27;s adventures. The first exo-skeletal Thing suit was destroyed after Galactus restored Ben&#x27;s natural powers and form. A second suit was built (presumably by Richards) and used sporadically when Ben had been returned to his human form again.

Reed has failed many times to restore Ben permanently to human form. When Doom reverses Sharon Ventura&#x27;s similar cosmic-ray transformation, he uses both science and magic. Ben is almost immortal when in his Thing form, as he only ages when he is human. After Franklin and Valeria create a formula that allows Ben to become human for one week each year, Reed and Nathaniel traveled over 3,000 years into the future to see Ben still alive after all that time.

===Earth-818===

Following Black Skull&#x27;s defeat, Ant-Man joins Robbie Reyes and his Deathlok companion in their quest to liberate the enslaved Earths from the Multiversal Masters of Evil as he leaves Infinity Thing and Wonder Man to rebuild Earth-818.

===&quot;Fantastic Four: The End&quot;===
In this six-issue miniseries, the entire Solar System is being colonized by humanity, with humanity undergoing a Golden Age because of the use of technology developed by Reed Richards in an effort to create a utopia. The Thing is married to Alicia Masters, has three super-powered children, and resides on Mars with the Inhumans. He is now capable of shifting between his human form and &#x27;Thing&#x27; form at will.

In the &quot;House of M&quot; limited series, Ben is the pilot in Reed Richards&#x27; voyage to space, alongside Susan Storm and John Jameson. Like the others, Grimm is mutated, though he is the only survivor of the rocket&#x27;s explosion. Ben is transformed into a rock-skinned creature with superhuman strength and a diminished intellect. He is taken in by Dr. Doom, who names him the It. The It becomes one of the Fearsome Four, though he is treated like an animal and often the victim of Doom&#x27;s frustrations.

===Marvel 1602===
In Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;, Benjamin Grimm is the captain of the ship &quot;The Fantastick&quot;, before gaining his abilities from the Anomaly. His power is associated with the classical element of earth.

In the sequel, &quot;1602: Fantastick Four&quot;, Benjamin finds work as an actor with William Shakespeare&#x27;s troupe, where he can hide his monstrous form behind false whiskers as Falstaff. He is soon forced to reveal himself, however, when Otto von Doom&#x27;s vulture soldiers kidnap Shakespeare.

===Marvel 2099===
On the Marvel 2099 reality of Earth-96943, the Thing of 2099 is a clone of Ben Grimm. He and his fellow Fantastic Four clones were created by the 2099 version of Uatu the Watcher.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the Marvel Mangaverse comics Benjamin (pronounced &quot;Ben-ya-meen&quot;) Grimm is a member of the Megascale Metatalent Response Team Fantastic Four.

===Marvel Zombies===
In this miniseries, the Thing, along with the other three members of the Fantastic Four, is a cannibalistic zombie because of an alien virus infection that has spread to all heroes.Reed Richards has gone insane after deliberately infecting Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Ben Grimm. They turn into zombies and infect Reed, too, who willingly allows them to do so to feel what being infected is like. Zombie Reed contacts Ultimate Reed and his Ultimate team counterparts and is subsequently foiled. They are even foiled by Magneto, who had saved Ultimate Reed from the zombies. The Thing and the others find Ultimate Doctor Doom&#x27;s body swapped with Ultimate Reed. Ultimate Reed (in Ultimate Doom&#x27;s body) kills all of the Fantastic Four. The Thing is seemingly killed by Reed/Doom when he rips off his arm and beats him with it, but his remains are sent back to his universe.

===MC2===
In the alternative future timeline of the Marvel universe published under the MC2 imprint, Ben is still a member of the Fantastic Four, whose roster has expanded to make them the Fantastic 5. In this future, he is married to Sharon Ventura and has a set of twin children by her (Jacob and Alyce), though they are now divorced. He appears alongside the F5 whenever they appear in the &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; series and related mini-series.

===New Amsterdam===
In &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #50 (April 1979), Reed Richards advises Ben that the cure Reed has developed for his condition will not work. Ben time-travels to the past to give himself the cure at an earlier stage, where it might work. It does, but on return to the present, nothing has changed. Reed advises him that he succeeded only in creating an alternative universe. In &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #100 (June 1983), Reed examines records of that trip and determines that Ben did not create that reality after all, based on a newspaper that shows the name of the city as &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; instead of &quot;New York&quot;. Ben returns to that reality, where Ben Grimm is a bartender and the leader of the remaining humans in a post-apocalyptic city.

===&quot;Ruins&quot;===
In Warren Ellis&#x27; 1995 &quot;Ruins&quot; miniseries, Ben refuses to fly Reed&#x27;s ship the &quot;Astraea&quot;, feeling it inadequately engineered. Victor von Doom pilots it instead. This results in the horrific mutation and subsequent deaths of all on board. Grimm avoids becoming the Thing, but is left to live with the guilt of thinking he could have prevented the tragedy. Grimm&#x27;s decision to refuse Richards&#x27; offer seems to be the single moment that caused this reality to go horribly wrong, with ramifications leading to a corrupt government, concentration camps and the horrific fates of the would-be Marvels of this universe.

===&quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;===

In this reality where Gwen Stacy became Spider-Woman, Ben Grimm is an NYPD cop who never became Thing. Noticeably out of all the Fantastic Four members in this reality, Ben is the only one who is an adult, as Johnny and Sue are child television stars and Reed is a kid genius.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Ben is Reed&#x27;s childhood friend: Ben would protect Reed from bullies and Reed would help Ben with his homework. When Ben is invited to watch Reed&#x27;s teleportation experiment, he is caught in it with Reed and the others. The resulting event gives Ben a rocky hide and enormous strength.

In one storyline, the four travel through time to prevent Reed&#x27;s experiment from failing. Instead, he contacts the Skrulls, and the resultant trade of information gives humanity super-powers from the aliens, rather than from the accident. While most of the Fantastic Four gain the same powers they would have in most other worlds, Ben himself opts to refuse. When the Skrulls betray humanity and the super-powered humans are all killed, Ben confronts their leader and travels back in time once more to set things &quot;right,&quot; although he sacrifices himself in the process.

Later, Ben transforms again, potentially thanks to Reed, back to a more human form, as if the rocky exterior were a cocoon. In his new form, he typically appears human, but his skin may take on a purple glow accompanying moments of strength. Other abilities include the capacity to move through Susan&#x27;s force fields and others hinted at but yet unclear. He later demonstrated the ability to go back and forth between his two forms.

At the end of the Doomsday trilogy, Ben and Susan were engaged.

===Ultimate Universe===
During the &quot;Ultimate Invasion&quot; storyline, Maker traveled to Earth-6160 and remade it into his own image. One of the things he did was make sure that those who would&#x27;ve became the Fantastic Four didn&#x27;t fly into the cosmic storm. Maker&#x27;s memory log lists Ben Grimm as &quot;deceased&quot;. This was further elaborated in Doom&#x27;s flashback where they took the shuttle into outer space against Franklin Storm&#x27;s orders. Because of Maker&#x27;s sabotage, Johnny Storm burned to death and Susan Storm was dying from the radiation. As for Ben Grimm, he was later found dead at the bottom of a quarry with some people ruling it as a suicide.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
Thing has been featured in different &quot;What If&quot; stories.

* In &quot;What If Doctor Doom Had Become the Thing?&quot; #1 (February 2005), Doom befriends Reed Richards during their college days, and Ben is left out. Dropping out of college, Ben joins the Army. Doom and Reed go ahead with their experimental rocket. When the cosmic rays turn Doom into a Thing-like creature, he attacks Reed, sending him into a gamma bomb test site where Ben is stationed. Ben saves Reed from the bomb&#x27;s radiation, but is transformed into a Hulk-like creature. Calling himself &quot;Grimm&quot;, he fights and defeats Doom. After Reed calms him down, Ben joins him in forming the Fantastic Four.
* In &quot;What If?&quot; #11, the original Marvel bullpen becomes the Fantastic Four (Jack Kirby becomes the Thing, Stan Lee becomes Mr. Fantastic, etc.) when cosmic rays from a booby-trapped package sent by the &quot;S&quot; people (Skrulls) bombard the Bullpen in their office. This Thing has the ability to resume normal form when he sets out to work on drawing Marvel Comics, but this was used only once in the story.
* In &quot;What If?&quot; vol. 2 #11 (March 1990), the origins of the Fantastic Four are retold in four stories, each showing how the heroes&#x27; lives would have changed if all four had each gained the same powers as the individual members of the original Fantastic Four:
** Invisibility: The Fantastic Four gain Invisible Woman-style powers and battle Doctor Doom as S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Ben can project invisible force fields.
** Stretching: Finding the Mr. Fantastic-style power absurd, Ben never uses it and ends up marrying Sue Storm.
** Monsters: The Fantastic Four all turn into monsters and go to live on Monster Island. Ben looks like his Earth-616 self.
** Torches: The flame-powered Fantastic Four disband after being unable to save a child from a fire. Ben joins the Avengers, calling himself the Human Torch.

==Reception==
In 2011, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the Thing 18th in the &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot;, and 23rd in their list of &quot;The Top 50 Avengers&quot; in 2012. The Thing was named &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s tenth of &quot;The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters&quot; in 2008.

The Thing was ranked #2 on a listing of Marvel Comics&#x27; monster characters in 2015.

In 2022, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; included The Thing in their &quot;MCU: 10 Most Desired Fan Favorite Debuts Expected In The Multiverse Saga&quot; list.

Lee later noted that The Thing was the most popular character in the Fantastic Four; he surmised that the character fit the classic grotesque archetype, much as Quasimodo was more popular than Claude Frollo, Esmerelda or the more &quot;glamorous&quot; characters in &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;. For his next superhero creation, he deliberately drew on that popularity in creating the similarly monstrous Hulk.

In 1888, Sheridan County was created from a portion of Johnson County. In 1890, Big Horn County was created from Johnson County along with land from Fremont County and Sheridan County.

From 1889 to 1893, Johnson County was the scene of the Johnson County War, where wealthy cattle ranchers seeking to control limited resources enlisted hired guns to fight smaller settlers and homesteaders.

In 1911, the boundaries of Johnson County and adjacent Crook, Natrona and Weston Counties were adjusted to run along federal land survey lines.

==Government and infrastructure==
Johnson County voters are reliably Republican. Since Wyoming statehood, the voters of this county have selected the Democratic Party candidate in only three national elections: William Jennings Bryan in 1896; Woodrow Wilson in 1912 by two votes and with only 37.5 percent of the total vote (due to Roosevelt&#x27;s independent run that year); and Franklin D. Roosevelt by seventy votes in his 1932 landslide. FDR did not carry the county in his re-election campaigns; in 1936 Johnson was Alf Landon’s second-best county in the Western United States behind Rio Blanco County, Colorado. In the 1964 Democratic landslide it was Barry Goldwater&#x27;s best county in Wyoming, and second-best in the West behind Utah&#x27;s traditional banner Republican county of Kane.













The Wyoming Department of Health Veteran&#x27;s Home of Wyoming, an assisted living facility for veterans and their dependents, is in Buffalo. The Wyoming Board of Charities and Reform operated the facility until the agency was dissolved as a result of a state constitutional amendment passed in November 1990.

<doc id="75829" wikidata="Q6268269" url="?curid=75829" title="Johnson County War">
<text>The Johnson County War, also known as the War on Powder River and the Wyoming Range War, was a range war in Johnson County, Wyoming from 1889 to 1893. The conflict began when cattle companies started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area, many of whom were settlers who competed with them for livestock, land and water rights. As violence swelled between the large established ranchers and the smaller settlers in the state, it culminated in the Powder River Country, when the ranchers hired gunmen, who invaded the county. The gunmen&#x27;s initial incursion in the territory alerted the small farmers and ranchers, as well as the state lawmen, and they formed a posse of 200 men that led to a grueling standoff which ended when the United States Cavalry on the orders of President Benjamin Harrison relieved the two forces, although further fighting persisted.

The events have since become a highly mythologized and symbolic story of the Wild West and over the years variations of the story have come to include some of its most famous historical figures. In addition to being one of the best-known range wars of the American frontier, its themes, especially class warfare, served as a basis for numerous popular novels, films and television shows in the Western genre.

==Background==
Conflict over land was a common occurrence in the development of the American West, but was particularly prevalent during the late 19th century, when large portions of the West were being settled by new immigrants for the first time through the Homestead Acts. It is a period that one historian, Richard Maxwell Brown, has called the &quot;Western Civil War of Incorporation&quot;, of which the Johnson County War was a part.

In the early days of Wyoming, most of the land was in public domain, which was open to stock raising as an open range and farmlands for homesteading. Large numbers of cattle were turned loose on the open range by ranches. Each spring, round-ups were held to separate the cattle belonging to different ranchers. Before a round-up, an orphan or stray calf was sometimes surreptitiously branded, which was the common way to identify the cow&#x27;s owners. However, as more and more homesteaders called &quot;nesters&quot; and &quot;grangers&quot; moved into Wyoming, competition for land and water soon enveloped the state, and the large cattle companies, also known as “cattle barons”, reacted by monopolizing large areas of the open range, preventing homesteaders from using it. The often uneasy relationship between the wealthier ranchers and smaller settlers of relatively modest means steadily aggravated after the harsh winter of 1886–1887, when a series of blizzards and temperatures of , followed by an extremely hot and dry summer, ravaged the frontier. Thousands of cattle were lost in the calamity.

To protect whatever livestock survived, the cattle barons reacted with a catch-all allegation of rustling against their competition. Hostilities worsened when the Wyoming legislature passed the Maverick Act, which stated that all unbranded cattle in the open range automatically belonged to the large ranchers. The cattle barons also held a firm grip on Wyoming&#x27;s stock interests by limiting the number of small ranchers and grangers who could participate, including in the annual round-ups. They also forbade their employees from owning cattle for fear of additional competition, and they threatened anyone they suspected to be rustlers. Although at a financial disadvantage, the homesteaders outnumbered the cattle barons significantly, and they tried to use this to win court cases by participating in the jury. However, records showed that they were still not successful.

===Wyoming Stock Growers Association===
Many of the large ranching outfits in Wyoming were organized as the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (the WSGA) and gathered socially at the Cheyenne Club in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Comprising some of the state&#x27;s wealthiest and most influential residents, the organization held a great deal of political sway in the state and region. The WSGA organized the cattle industry by scheduling roundups and cattle shipments. The WSGA also employed an agency of detectives to investigate cases of cattle theft from its members&#x27; holdings. Grangers and rustlers often intermixed with one another in the community, making it more difficult for detectives to differentiate the criminals and the innocent homesteaders.

Rustling in the local area was likely increasing because of the harsh grazing conditions, and the illegal exploits of organized groups of rustlers were becoming well publicized in the late 1880s. Well-armed outfits of horse and cattle rustlers roamed across various portions of Wyoming and Montana, with Montana vigilantes such as the infamous Stuart&#x27;s Stranglers declaring &quot;War on the Rustlers&quot; in 1884. Bandits taking refuge in the infamous hideout known as the Hole-in-the-Wall were also preying upon the herds. Frank M. Canton, Sheriff of Johnson County in the early 1880s and better known as a detective for the WSGA, was a prominent figure in supposedly eliminating these criminals from Wyoming. Before the events in Johnson County, Canton had already developed a reputation as a lethal gunman. At a young age he had worked as a cowboy in Texas, and in 1871 he started a career in robbery and cattle rustling, as well as killing a Buffalo Soldier on October 10, 1874. Historian Harry Sinclair Drago described Canton as a &quot;merciless, congenital, emotionless killer. For pay, he murdered eight—very likely ten—men.&quot;

==War==
===Early killings===
On July 20, 1889, a range detective from the WSGA named George Henderson accused Ella Watson (better known as Cattle Kate), a local rancher, of stealing cattle from a fellow rancher by the name of Albert John Bothwell. The cattlemen sent riders to seize Watson before capturing her husband Jim Averell as well. Both of them were subsequently lynched. This gruesome act was one of the rare cases in the Old West in which a woman was lynched, an event that appalled many of the local residents and paved the way for future events in the war. County Sheriff Frank Hadsell arrested six men for the lynching and a trial date was set. However, before the trial, threats were sent to the witnesses who were to testify against the aggressors. One of those witnesses was young Gene Crowder, who mysteriously disappeared under unknown circumstances before the trial. Another, Averell&#x27;s nephew and foreman Frank Buchanan, disappeared from the county as well after a shootout with unknown suspects, and was presumed to be hiding or murdered. Ralph Cole, another nephew of Averell&#x27;s, died on the day of the trial from poisoning.

Enemies of the WSGA soon fought back. Henderson, the range detective who had accused Watson, was murdered near Sweetwater Creek in October 1890. The cattle barons soon tightened their control and hunted down those who tried to oppose them. The double lynching of the Averells was followed by the lynching of Tom Waggoner, a horse trader from Newcastle, Wyoming, in June 1891. A friend of Waggoner named Jimmy the Butcher, who was once arrested for rustling cattle belonging to the Standard Cattle Company, was also murdered. Range detective Tom Smith killed a suspected rustler, and when he was indicted for murder, political connections to the WSGA secured his release. These killings precipitated more hostilities and violence in the years to come.

After the lynchings of their prominent competitors, the WSGA&#x27;s control over the range was undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers&#x27; Association (NWFSGA) to compete with the WSGA, led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion. Upon hearing this, members of the WSGA immediately viewed the new association as a threat to their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the NWFSGA refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.

Soon, the prominent cattlemen sent out an assassination squad to kill Champion on the morning of November 1, 1891. Champion and another man, named Ross Gilbertson, were sleeping in a cabin near the Middle Fork of the Powder River when a group of armed men went inside. Only two were able to fit into the small cabin while four others stood by outside. Champion was immediately awakened by the intrusion, and as the gunmen pointed their weapons at him, Champion reached for his own pistol hidden under a pillow and a shootout commenced. Champion successfully shot two of the gunmen, mortally wounding and killing assassin Billy Lykins. The rest of the assassination squad subsequently fled. Champion was left uninjured except for some facial burns from gunpowder. In a subsequent investigation of the attack, the names of those involved were leaked to two ranchers: John A. Tisdale and Orley &quot;Ranger&quot; Jones. However, both men were ambushed and murdered while they were riding, which outraged many of the small ranchers and farmers in the county.

===Invaders===
The WSGA, led by Frank Wolcott (WSGA member and large North Platte rancher), hired gunmen with the intention of eliminating alleged rustlers in Johnson County and breaking up the NWFSGA. By that time, prominent names in Wyoming started taking sides. Acting governor Amos W. Barber supported the cattlemen, who blamed the small ranchers and homesteaders for the criminal activity in the state. Former cowboy, Indian War veteran, and Sheriff of Buffalo (the county seat of Johnson County), William &quot;Red&quot; Angus, supported the homesteaders, and believed that the cattle barons were abusing the homesteaders.

In March 1892, the cattlemen sent agents to Texas from Cheyenne and Idaho to recruit gunmen and finally carry out their plans for exterminating the homesteaders. This group became known as the &quot;Invaders&quot;. The cattle barons had always used hired guns from Texas to take out suspected rustlers and scare away the nesters in Wyoming. One particular act of violence perpetrated by the Texans was recounted by cowboy John J. Baker, where the Texans ambushed and killed nine trappers whom they mistook for rustlers in Big Dry Creek, Wyoming. They received a $450 bonus for the slaughter.

Soon, 23 gunmen from Paris, Texas, and 4 cattle detectives from the WSGA were hired, as well as Wyoming dignitaries who also joined the expedition. State Senator Bob Tisdale, State Water Commissioner W. J. Clarke, as well as William C. Irvine and Hubert Teshemacher, who had both been instrumental in the organization of the State of Wyoming four years earlier, also joined the band. They were accompanied by surgeon Charles Bingham Penrose as well as Ed Towse, a reporter for the &quot;Cheyenne Sun&quot;, and a newspaper reporter for the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;, Sam T. Clover, whose lurid first-hand accounts later appeared in eastern newspapers. A total expedition of 50 men was organized which consisted of cattlemen, range detectives, and the 23 hired guns from Texas. To lead the expedition, the WSGA hired Frank M. Canton. Canton&#x27;s gripsack was later found to contain a list of 70 county residents to be either shot or hanged, and a contract to pay the Texans $5 a day plus a bonus of $50 for every rustler, real or alleged, they killed. The group became known as the &quot;Invaders&quot;, or alternately, &quot;Wolcott&#x27;s Regulators&quot;.

John Clay, a prominent Wyoming businessman, was suspected of playing a major role in planning the Johnson County invasion. Clay denied this, saying that in 1891 he advised Wolcott against the scheme and was out of the country when it was undertaken. He later helped the &quot;Invaders&quot; avoid punishment after their surrender. The group organized in Cheyenne and proceeded by train to Casper, Wyoming, and then toward Johnson County on horseback, cutting the telegraph lines north of Douglas, Wyoming, in order to prevent an alarm. While on horseback, Canton and the gunmen traveled ahead while the party of WSGA officials led by Wolcott followed a safe distance behind.

===Gunfight at the KC Ranch===
The first target of the WSGA was Nate Champion, who was at the KC Ranch at that time. They were tasked to perform the assassination that others had failed to carry out five months before. The group traveled to the ranch late Friday, April 8, 1892, quietly surrounded the buildings, and waited for daybreak. Three men besides Champion were at the KC. Two men who were evidently going to spend the night on their way through were captured as they emerged from the cabin early that morning to collect water at the nearby Powder River, while the third, Nick Ray, was shot while standing inside the doorway of the cabin. As the gunmen opened fire on the cabin, Champion dragged the mortally wounded Ray back to the cabin. Ray died hours later, and Champion was left besieged inside the log cabin alone.

Champion held out for several hours, wounding three of the vigilantes, and was said to have killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion&#x27;s ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and, as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. &quot;Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once,&quot; he wrote. The last journal entry read: &quot;Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It&#x27;s not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again.&quot;

The Invaders continued to shoot at the cabin while others set it on fire using a wagon they managed to steal from Flagg. Champion signed his journal entry and put it in his pocket before running from the back door with a six-shooter in one hand and either a knife or a rifle in the other. As he emerged, the Invaders shot him dead. The killers pinned a note on Champion&#x27;s bullet-riddled chest that read, &quot;Cattle thieves beware&quot;. Flagg, after escaping his pursuers, rode to Buffalo where he reported Champion&#x27;s dilemma to the townsfolk. Sheriff Angus then raised a posse of 200 men, many of whom were Civil War veterans, over the next 24 hours and set out for the KC on Sunday night, April 10.

===Siege of the TA Ranch===

The WSGA group then headed north on Sunday toward Buffalo to continue its show of force. By early morning of the 11th however, news quickly came of a large hostile force heading towards them. They quickly rode and took refuge in the TA Ranch in Crazy Woman Creek. During their flight, one of the Texans by the name of Jim Dudley accidentally shot himself when his horse bucked and his rifle fell to the ground, discharging and hitting his knee. He was later escorted by two others to Fort McKinney to seek treatment, but died in the fort one or two days later from gangrene.

The sheriff&#x27;s posse finally reached the remaining Invaders holed up in a log barn at the TA Ranch, but the latter managed to hold them back, resulting in a siege that would last for three days. The posse surrounded the whole ranch, building pits on the ground for cover and killing the Invaders&#x27; horses to prevent them from escaping. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that twenty men tried to escape behind a fusillade, but the posse beat them back and killed three to five. Another Texas gunman, named Alex Lowther, accidentally shot himself mortally in the groin during the fight. As the siege dragged on, a settler rode off to Fort McKinney requesting to borrow a cannon but was turned down. A blacksmith named Rap Brown tried to build his own cannon, but it exploded when he first tested it. He then built a siege engine which the posse referred to as a &quot;go-devil&#x27; or &quot;ark of safety&quot; - a large, bullet-resistant wagon that would help the settlers get close to the ranch so they could throw dynamite at the Invaders.

Fortunately for the Invaders, one of their members, Mike Shonsey, managed to slip from the barn and was able to contact Governor Barber the next day. Frantic efforts to save the WSGA group ensued, and two days into the siege, late on the night of April 12, 1892, Governor Barber telegraphed President Benjamin Harrison a plea for help. For unknown reasons, the telegram failed to reach President Harrison, so Wyoming senators Joseph M. Carey and Francis E. Warren visited the White House in person and woke the President, informing him of the increasingly dangerous &quot;insurrection&quot; in Johnson County. Harrison immediately ordered the U.S. Secretary of War Stephen B. Elkins to address the situation under Article IV, Section 4, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which allows for the use of U.S. forces under the president&#x27;s orders for &quot;protection from invasion and domestic violence&quot;. The Sixth Cavalry from Fort McKinney near Buffalo, Wyoming, was ordered to proceed to the TA Ranch at once and take the WSGA expedition into custody. The Sixth Cavalry left Fort McKinney a few hours later at 2:00 on the morning of April 13 and reached the TA Ranch at 6:45 A.M. Colonel J.J. Van Horn, the officer in charge of the unit, negotiated with Sheriff Angus to lift the siege, and in return the Invaders were to be handed to civilian authorities. The Sixth Cavalry took possession of Wolcott and 45 other men with 45 rifles, 41 revolvers and some 5,000 rounds of ammunition, before escorting them first to Fort McKinney and then to Cheyenne. The text of Barber&#x27;s telegram to the President was printed on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on April 14, and a first-hand account of the siege at the T.A. appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; and other papers.

==Arrest and legal action==
The WSGA group was taken to Cheyenne to be held at the barracks of Fort D.A. Russell (currently Francis E. Warren Air Force Base) since the Laramie County Jail was unable to hold that many prisoners. They received preferential treatment and were allowed to roam the base by day as long as they agreed to return to the jail to sleep at night. Johnson County officials were upset that the group was not kept locally at Ft. McKinney. The general in charge of the 6th Cavalry felt that tensions were too high for the prisoners to remain in the area. Hundreds of armed locals sympathetic to both sides of the conflict were said to have gone to Ft. McKinney over the next few days under the mistaken impression the Invaders were being held there.

The Johnson County attorney began to gather evidence for the case and the details of the WSGA&#x27;s plan emerged. Canton&#x27;s gripsack was found to contain a list of seventy alleged rustlers who were to be shot or hanged, a list of ranch houses the Invaders had burned, and a contract to pay each Texan five dollars a day plus a bonus of $50 for each person killed. The Invader&#x27;s plans reportedly included the eventual murder of people as far away as Casper and Douglas. &quot;The Times&quot; reported on April 23 that &quot;the evidence is said to implicate more than twenty prominent stockmen of Cheyenne whose names have not been mentioned heretofore, also several wealthy stockmen of Omaha, as well as to compromise men high in authority in the State of Wyoming. They will all be charged with aiding and abetting the invasion, and warrants will be issued for the arrest of all of them.&quot;

The Invaders, however, were protected by a friendly judicial system, and they took advantage of the cattle barons&#x27; corruption. Charges against the men &quot;high in authority&quot; in Wyoming were never filed. Eventually they were released on bail and were told to return to Wyoming for the trial. Many fled to Texas and were never seen again. In the end, the WSGA group went free after the charges were dropped on the excuse that Johnson County refused to pay for the costs of the long prosecution. The costs of housing the men at Fort D.A. Russell were said to exceed $18,000 and the sparsely populated Johnson County was unable to pay for them

==Final killings==
Tensions in Johnson County remained high. On May 9, U.S. Marshal George Wellman was ambushed and killed by locals en route to the town of Buffalo. The incident received national attention, with Wellman being the only marshal to die in the war. Wellman had been one of the hired guns who joined the Invaders, and his death was grieved by a large crowd. The Sixth Cavalry, sent to relieve the county of its violence, was said to be influenced by intense local political and social pressure, and they were unable to keep the peace. One infamous event occurred when a group of men set fire to the post exchange and planted a homemade bomb in the cavalry&#x27;s barracks. Noted officer Charles B. Gatewood was seriously injured by the bomb blast in the barracks, shattering his left arm and ending his cavalry career.

The Ninth Cavalry of &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot; was ordered to Fort McKinney to replace the Sixth, commanded by Major Charles S. Isley. In a fortnight the Buffalo Soldiers moved from Nebraska to the rail town of Suggs, Wyoming, where they created &quot;Camp Bettens&quot; to quell the local population. Reception from the settlers was negative and in one violent incident a gunfight erupted between them and some Buffalo Soldiers who entered the town. After being initially driven off, 20 more soldiers slipped from the camp to exact revenge, but the locals fought back, resulting in the death of one Buffalo Soldier named Private Willis Johnson, and the wounding of two other soldiers. The brief skirmish became known as the Battle of Suggs. Another two detachments were sent and this time the locals allowed the soldiers to investigate but no one was convicted. Another buffalo soldier, by the name of Brown, was also murdered, when a cowboy shot him while both were in a rifle range. Johnson and Brown were buried next to each other, and these events forced the Army to retire the regiment from the place in November 1892. Phil DuFran, a range detective and member of the Invaders, mysteriously disappeared.

In the fall of 1892, as the aftershocks of the stand-off were still being felt throughout the county, two alleged horse rustlers were gunned down by range detectives east of the Big Horn River. The killers escaped the law with assistance from Otto Franc, a rancher who had sided with the large cattle company faction. On May 24, 1893, Champion&#x27;s brother, Dudley, came to Wyoming looking for work and was shot and killed in cold blood. from town, Dudley had come across the ranch of Mike Shonsey, who, after seeing him, immediately grabbed a gun and fired at him. A coroner&#x27;s inquiry ruled Shonsey&#x27;s actions were self-defense and he was acquitted of murder. Afterwards, Shonsey left the country before the officials could continue with the investigation. A year before Nate Champion&#x27;s death, Shonsey actually met him near the Beaver Creek Canyon, where a fight almost commenced between the two as Champion suspected that Shonsey was one of the five men who had attacked him in his cabin. He further threatened Shonsey and demanded he give up the names of the rest of the assassins. This event made Shonsey harbor hatred toward Champion and probably toward his brother Dudley as well. Dudley Champion was the last person killed in association with the Johnson County War.

==Aftermath==

Approximately 20-40 people were killed in the conflict, including those who were lynched. Emotions ran high for many years afterward. Some considered the large and wealthy ranchers as heroes who had sought what they regarded as justice by using violence to defend what they regarded as their rights to range land and water rights, while others saw the WSGA as heavy-handed outlaw vigilantes running roughshod over the law. A number of tall tales were spun by both sides afterwards to make their actions appear morally justified. Parties sympathetic to the invaders painted Watson as a prostitute and cattle rustler. They painted Averell as her murderous partner in crime and pimp and Nate Champion as the leader of a vast cattle rustling empire. They claimed that he was a leading member of the fabled &quot;Red Sash Gang&quot; of outlaws that supposedly included the likes of the Jesse James gang. These claims have since been discredited.

While men frequently visited Watson&#x27;s cabin, this was because she mended clothing for cowboys as a source of income. While some accounts do note that Champion wore a red sash at the time of his death, such sashes were common. While the Hole in the Wall Gang was known to hide out in Johnson County, there is no evidence that Champion had any relationship to them. Parties sympathetic to the smaller ranchers spun tales that included some of the West&#x27;s most notorious gunslingers under the employ of the Invaders, including such legends as Tom Horn and &quot;Big Nose&quot; George Parrot. Horn did briefly work as a detective for the WSGA in the 1890s but there is little evidence he was involved in the war.

===Political effects===
Although many of the leaders of the WSGA&#x27;s hired force, such as William C. Irvine, were Democrats, the ranchers who had hired the group were tied to the Republican Party and their opponents were mostly Democrats. Many viewed the rescue of the WSGA group at the order of President Harrison (a Republican) and the failure of the courts to prosecute them a serious political scandal with overtones of class war. As a result of the scandal, the Democratic Party became popular in Wyoming for a time, winning the governorship in 1892 and taking control of both houses of the state legislature in that election. Wyoming voted for the Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 U.S. presidential election, and Johnson County was one of the two counties in the state with the largest Bryan majorities.

===Economic analysis===
Historian Daniel Belgrad argues that in the 1880s centralized range management was emerging as the solution to the overgrazing that had depleted open ranges. Moreover, cattle prices at the time were low. Larger ranchers also were hurt by mavericking (taking lost, unbranded calves from other ranchers&#x27; herds), and responded by organizing cooperative roundups, blacklisting, and lobbying for stricter anti-maverick laws. These ranchers formed the WSGA and hired gunmen to hunt down rustlers, but local farmers resented the ranchers&#x27; collective political power. The farmers moved toward decentralization and the use of private winter pastures. Randy McFerrin and Douglas Wills argue that the confrontation represented opposing property rights systems. The result was the end of the open-range system and the dominance of large-scale stock ranching and farming. The popular image of the war, however, remains that of vigilantism by aggressive landed interests against small individual settlers defending their rights.

By 1893, the WSGA was opened to the other small ranchers and farmers, finally ending their monopoly and control over Wyoming business interests. Previous practices of the WSGA, such as vigilantism and confiscation of cattle, were finally stopped. Many prominent leaders of the association such as Frank Wolcott, Frank M. Canton and Tom Smith later left the area.

==Legacy==

The Johnson County War, with its overtones of class warfare coupled with the intervention ordered by the President of the United States to save the lives of a gang of hired killers and set them free, is not a flattering reflection on the American myth of the west. The Johnson County War has been one of the best-known range wars of the frontier. It has been a popular feature of the Western genre of fiction, which includes literature, films and television shows. &quot;The Banditti of the Plains&quot;, written in 1894 by witness Asa Mercer, is the earliest record of the Johnson County War. The book was suppressed for many years by the WSGA, who seized and destroyed all but a few of the first edition copies from the 1894 printing; they were rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped from a printer north of Denver, Colorado. The book was reprinted several times in the 20th century and most recently in 2015. Frances McElrath&#x27;s 1902 novel &quot;The Rustler&quot;, took inspiration from the Johnson County War, and was sympathetic to the perspective of the small ranchers.

&quot;The Virginian&quot;, a seminal 1902 western novel by Owen Wister, took the side of the wealthy ranchers, creating a myth of the Johnson County War, but bore little resemblance to a factual account of the actual characters and events. Jack Schaefer&#x27;s popular 1949 novel &quot;Shane&quot; treated themes associated with the Johnson County War and took the side of the settlers. The 1953 film &quot;The Redhead from Wyoming,&quot; starring Maureen O&#x27;Hara, dealt with similar themes; in one scene O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s character is told, &quot;It won&#x27;t be long before they&#x27;re calling you Cattle Kate.&quot; In the 1968 novel &quot;True Grit&quot; by Charles Portis, the main character, Rooster Cogburn, was involved in the Johnson County War. In the early 1890s Cogburn had gone north to Wyoming where he was &quot;hired by stock owners to terrorize thieves and people called nesters and grangers... . I fear that Rooster did himself no credit in what they called the Johnson County War.&quot;

Films such as &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Johnson County War&quot; (TV-movie, 2002) painted the wealthy ranchers as the &quot;bad guys&quot;. &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; was a dramatic romance loosely based on historical events, while &quot;The Johnson County War&quot; was based on the 1957 novel &quot;Riders of Judgment&quot; by Frederick Manfred. The range war was also portrayed in an episode of Jim Davis&#x27;s syndicated Western television series &quot;Stories of the Century&quot;, with Henry Brandon as Nate Champion and Jean Parker as Ella Watson. American Heroes Channel presented the Johnson County War in the sixth episode of their &quot;Blood Feuds&quot; series documentary.

The story of the Johnson County War from the point of view of the small ranchers was chronicled by Kaycee resident Chris LeDoux in his song &quot;Johnson County War&quot; on the 1989 album &quot;Powder River&quot;. The song included references to the burning of the KC Ranch, the capture of the WSGA men, the intervention of the U.S. Cavalry and the release of the cattlemen and hired guns. The Jim Gatchell Memorial Museum in Buffalo featured dioramas and exhibits about the Johnson County War, as well as a bronze statue of Nate Champion. Kaycee, Wyoming, the old site of the KC Ranch, also erected the &quot;Hoofprints of the Past&quot; Museum to commemorate the war.

<text>Flavius Aetius (also spelled Aëtius; ; 390 – 21 September 454) was a Roman general and statesman of the closing period of the Western Roman Empire. He was a military commander and the most influential man in the Empire for two decades (433454). He managed policy in regard to the attacks of barbarian federates settled throughout the West. Notably, he mustered a large Roman and allied (&quot;foederati&quot;) army in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, ending an invasion of Gaul by Attila in 451, though the Hun and his subjugated allies still managed to invade Italy the following year, an incursion best remembered for the Sack of Aquileia and the intercession of Pope Leo I. In 454, he was assassinated by the emperor Valentinian III.

Aetius has often been called the &quot;Last of the Romans&quot;. Edward Gibbon refers to him as &quot;the man universally celebrated as the terror of Barbarians and the support of the Republic&quot; for his victory at the Catalaunian Plains. J.B. Bury notes, &quot;That he was the one prop and stay of the Western Empire during his life time was the unanimous verdict of his contemporaries.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Origins and family ===

Aetius was born at Durostorum in Moesia Secunda (modern Silistra, Bulgaria), roughly around 390, as he was described as a &quot;young adolescent&quot; in 405. His father, Gaudentius, was a Roman general and described as a native of the province of Scythia. Aetius&#x27; mother, whose name is unknown, was a wealthy aristocratic woman of ancestry from Rome or some other city in the Italian peninsula. Before 425 Aetius married the daughter of Carpilio, who gave him a son, also named Carpilio. Later he married Pelagia, widow of Bonifacius, from whom he had a son, Gaudentius. It is possible that he also had a daughter, whose husband, Thraustila, avenged Aetius&#x27; death by killing emperor Valentinian III.

=== Early years and service under Joannes ===

As a boy, Aetius was at the service of the imperial court, enrolled in the military unit of the &quot;Protectores Domestici&quot; and then elevated to the position of &quot;tribunus praetorianus partis militaris&quot;, setting him up for future political eligibility. Between 405 and 408 he was kept as hostage at the court of Alaric I, king of the Visigoths. In 408 Alaric asked to keep Aetius as a hostage, but was refused, as Aetius was sent to the court of Uldin, king of the Huns, where he would stay throughout much of the reign of Charaton, Uldin&#x27;s successor. Some modern historians have suggested that Aetius&#x27;s upbringing amongst militaristic peoples gave him a martial vigour not common in contemporary Roman generals.

In 423 the Western Emperor Honorius died. The most influential man in the West, Castinus, chose as his successor Joannes, a high-ranking officer. Joannes was not a member of the Theodosian dynasty so he was not recognized by the eastern court. The Eastern Emperor Theodosius II organised a military expedition westward, led by Ardaburius and his son Aspar, to put his cousin, the young Valentinian III (who was a nephew of Honorius), on the western throne. Aetius entered the service of the usurper as &quot;cura palatii&quot; and was sent by Joannes to ask the Huns for assistance. Joannes lacked a strong army and fortified himself in his capital, Ravenna, where he was killed in the summer of 425. Shortly afterwards, Aetius returned to Italy with a large force of Huns to find that power in the west was now in the hands of Valentinian III and his mother Galla Placidia. After fighting against Aspar&#x27;s army, Aetius managed to compromise with Galla Placidia. He sent back his army of Huns and in return obtained the rank of &quot;comes et magister militum per Gallias&quot;, the commander in chief of the Roman army in Gaul.

=== First Gallic campaigns ===

In 426, Aetius arrived in southern Gaul and took command of the field army. At that time Arelate, an important city in Narbonensis near the mouth of the Rhone, was under siege from the Visigoths, led by their king Theodoric I. Aetius defeated Theodoric, lifted the siege of Arelate, and drove the Visigoths back to their holdings in Aquitania.
In 428, he fought the Salian Franks, defeating their king Chlodio and recovering some territory they had occupied along the Rhine. In 429 he was elevated to the rank of &quot;magister militum&quot;; this was probably the &quot;junior&quot; of the two offices of &quot;comes et magister utriusque militiae&quot;, as the &quot;senior&quot; is known to have been the patrician Flavius Constantinus Felix, the most influential man in those years, and a supporter of Galla Placidia. Begin 430 the Visigoths led by Anaolsus attacked Arelate again but were defeated by Aetius. 
In May 430, Aetius and the Army accused Felix of plotting against him and some sources believe Aetius had him, his wife, and a deacon killed. Once Felix was dead, Aetius was the highest ranking amongst the &quot;magistri militiae&quot;, even if he had not yet been granted the title of &quot;patricius&quot; or the senior command. During 430 and 431 Aetius was in Raetia and Noricum, re-establishing Roman rule on the Danubian Limes, campaigning against the Juthungi and defeating the Bagaudae in Augusta Vindelicorum. In 431 he returned to Gaul, where he received Hydatius, bishop of Aquae Flaviae, who complained about the attacks of the Suebes. Aetius then defeated the Franks, recapturing Tournacum and Cambriacum. He then sent Hydatius back to the Suebes in Hispania.

=== War with Bonifacius ===
While Aetius was campaigning in Gaul, there was an ongoing power struggle among Aetius, Felix, Bonifacius, and the emperor Valentinian&#x27;s mother and regent Galla Placidia. In 427 while Bonifacius was away as governor (&quot;comes&quot;) of Africa, Felix caused him to fall into disfavour with Placidia. Bonifacius was eventually returned to favor by Placidia, but only after Felix had sent Sigisvult and two other armies against him when Aetius warned him of Felix&#x27;s intentions. In 429, the Vandals exploited this power struggle and crossed over to Africa.

After the execution of Felix in 430, Aetius and Bonifacius remained as the empire&#x27;s most influential generals, both constantly vying for the favor of Placidia.
In 432 Aetius held the consulate, but Bonifacius was recalled to Italy and received warmly by Placidia. Bonifacius was given the rank of patrician and made the senior &quot;comes et magister utriusque militiae&quot;, while Aetius was stripped of his military command. Aetius, believing his fall now imminent, marched against Bonifacius and fought him at the Battle of Rimini. Bonifacius won the battle but was mortally wounded, dying a few months later. Aetius escaped to Pannonia and traveled to the court of his friend, Rugila, the king of the Huns. With their help he returned to power, receiving the title of &quot;comes et magister utriusque militiae&quot;. Aetius then had Bonifacius&#x27; son-in-law, Sebastianus, who had succeeded Bonifacius as &quot;magister militum&quot;, exiled from Italy to Constantinople, bought the properties of Bonifacius, and married his widow Pelagia.

=== Campaigns against Burgundians, Bagaudae, and Visigoths ===
From 433 to 450, Aetius was the dominant figure in the Western Empire, obtaining the rank of &quot;magnificus vir parens patriusque noster&quot; (5 September 435) and playing the role of &quot;protector&quot; of Galla Placidia and Valentinian III while the Emperor was still young. At the same time he continued to devote attention to Gaul. In 436, the Burgundians of King Gundacar were defeated and obliged to accept peace by Aetius and Avitus; however, the following year he sent Hun &quot;foederati&quot; to destroy them. Allegedly 20,000 Burgundians were killed in a slaughter which probably became the basis of the Nibelungenlied, a German epic. That same year Aetius was probably in Armorica with Litorius to suppress a rebellion of the Bagaudae under a certain Tibatto. The year 437 saw his second consulship and the wedding of Valentinian and Licinia Eudoxia in Constantinople; it is probable that Aetius attended the ceremony that marked the restoration of the direct rule of the Emperor. At that time his general Litorius had broken the siege of Narbona and had turned the war in favor of the Romans. The following two years were occupied by a campaign against the Suebi and by the war against the Visigoths; in 438 Aetius won a major battle (probably the Battle of Mons Colubrarius), but in 439 the Visigoths defeated and killed Litorius and his Hun Foederati. Aetius returned to Gaul after Vetericus had stabilized the situation, and defeated the Visigoths and obtained a treaty. On his return to Italy, he was honoured by a statue erected by the Senate and the People of Rome by order of the Emperor; this was probably the occasion for the panegyric written by Merobaudes.

In 443, Aetius settled the remaining Burgundians in Sapaudia, south of Lake Geneva. His most pressing concern in the 440s was with problems in Gaul and Iberia, mainly with the Bagaudae. He settled the Alans around Valence in 440 and along the Loire including Aurelianum in 442 to contain unrest in Armorica.

In Spain, Aetius was slowly losing his grip on the situation. In 441 he appointed Asturius &quot;Magister Militum per Hispanias&quot;, in order to put down the Bagaudae in Tarraconensis. He was recalled and Merobaudes defeated the Bagaudae of Aracellitanus in 443. In 445 the Romans had the Vandals attack Turonium in Gallaecia, followed by Vitus who campaigned with a combined force of Romans and Goths in 446, but was ultimately defeated.

The Bagaudae in Armorica revolted again in 447 or 448, and were put down by the Alans of Goar. As a result, the leader of the revolt Eudoxius fled to the court of Attila the Hun. In 449 the Bagaudae in Spain revolted and sacked Tyriasso, Caesaragusta, and Illerdensus. The Suebi also entered Tarraconensis to assist Basilius and his revolt.

In 445 Majorian defeated a Frankish siege of Turonum, which was followed by a Frankish attack under Clodio in the region of Atrebatum, in Belgica Secunda. The &quot;foederati&quot; were stopped in an ambush near &quot;Vicus Helena&quot;, where Aetius directed the operations while his commander Majorian (later Emperor) fought with the cavalry. However, by 450 Aetius had already returned to good terms with the Franks. In 449 Chlodio died, and the &quot;patricius&quot; supported his younger son Merovaeus&#x27;s claim to the throne. Aetius adopted him as his own son and sent him from Rome, where he had been an ambassador, to the Frankish court with many presents.

=== Hun invasions of Gaul and Italy ===

Before 449 Aetius had signed an agreement with the Huns, allowing some of them to settle in Pannonia, along the Sava River; he also sent to Attila, the king of the Huns, a man called Constantius as a secretary. In 449, Attila was angry over an alleged theft of a golden plate, and Aetius sent him an embassy under Romulus to calm him; Attila sent him a dwarf, Zerco, as a present, whom Aetius gave back to his original owner, Aspar.

However, the good terms between Romans and Huns did not last, as Attila wanted to attack Roman Gaul; he knew that Aetius was a serious obstacle to his enterprise, and tried to have him removed, but in 451, when the Huns attacked, Aetius was still the commander of the Roman army in Gaul. The large Hunno-German army captured several cities, and proceeded towards Aurelianum.

Aetius, with the help of the influential Gallo-Roman senator Avitus, convinced the Visigoths of king Theodoric I to join him against the external menace; he also succeeded in persuading Sambida (who was falsely accused of planning to join the Huns), the Armoricans, the Salian Franks, some of the Saxons, and the Burgundians of Sapaudia to join his forces. Then the joint Roman and Visigothic army moved to relieve the besieged city of Aurelianum, forcing the Huns to abandon the siege and retreat to open country.

On 20 June 451 Aetius and Theodoric engaged Attila and his allies at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains. Theodoric died in the battle, and Aetius suggested his son Thorismund retreat to Tolosa to secure his throne, and persuaded Merovaeus to return to the lands of the Franks; for this reason it is said that Aetius kept all of the battlefield loot for his army.

Attila returned in 452 to again press his claim of marriage to Honoria; Aetius was unable to block Attila&#x27;s advance through the Julian Alps. Instead, he chose to garrison Aquileia against Attila&#x27;s onslaught. Attila invaded and ravaged Italy, sacking numerous cities and razing Aquileia completely, allegedly leaving no trace of it behind. Valentinian III fled from the court at Ravenna to Rome; Aetius remained in the field but lacked the strength to offer battle, instead positioning his army at Bononia to block the roads through the Apennines to Ravenna and Rome. Edward Gibbon however says Aetius never showed his greatness more clearly in managing to harass and slow Attila&#x27;s advance with only a shadow force. Attila finally halted at the Po, where he met an embassy including the prefect Trygetius, the ex-consul Gennadius Avienus, and Pope Leo I. After the meeting he turned his army back, having gained neither Honoria&#x27;s hand nor the territories he desired. Ancient and medieval historians tended to give Pope Leo and supernatural forces credit for halting Attila, but a number of practical factors may have also induced Attila to retreat: his army was unable to obtain sufficient food and was suffering from disease, Aetius&#x27; army was busy harassing the Huns, and finally Marcian had sent forces north of the Danube to attack the homelands of the Huns and their vassals under a separate Aetius.

=== Assassination ===

Although in 453 Aetius had been able to betroth his son Gaudentius to Valentinian&#x27;s daughter Placidia, Valentinian felt intimidated by Aetius, who some 30 years prior had supported Joannes against him and who, Valentinian believed, wanted to place his son on the throne. The Roman senator Petronius Maximus and the chamberlain Heraclius were therefore able to enlist Valentinian in a plot to assassinate Aetius. The ancient historian Priscus of Panium reports that on 21 September 454, while Aetius was at court in Ravenna delivering a financial account, Valentinian suddenly leaped from his seat and declared that he would no longer be the victim of Aetius&#x27;s drunken depravities. He held Aetius responsible for the empire&#x27;s troubles and accused him of trying to steal the empire from him. When Aetius attempted to defend himself from the charges, Valentinian drew his sword and together with Heraclius, struck Aetius on the head, killing him instantly. Later, when Valentinian boasted that he had done well in disposing of Aetius, someone at court responded, &quot;Whether well or not, I do not know. But know that you have cut off your right hand with your left.&quot; Edward Gibbon credits Sidonius Apollinaris with this famous observation.

Maximus expected to be made patrician in place of Aetius, but was blocked by Heraclius. Seeking revenge, Maximus arranged with two Huns who were friends of Aetius, Optila and Thraustila, to assassinate both Valentinian III and Heraclius. On 16 March 455, Optila stabbed the emperor in the temple as he dismounted in the Campus Martius and prepared for a session of archery practice. As the stunned emperor turned to see who had struck him, Optila finished him off with another thrust of his blade. Meanwhile, Thraustila stepped forward and killed Heraclius. Most of the soldiers standing close by had been faithful followers of Aetius, and none lifted a hand to save the emperor.

== Legacy ==

=== Military legacy ===

Aetius is generally viewed as a great military commander – indeed, he was held in such high esteem by the Eastern Roman Empire that he became known as the last true Roman of the west. Traditionally, historians also consider the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains as decisively important, crippling Attila by destroying his aura of invincibility. Gibbon states this view:

Aetius effectively ruled the western empire from 433 to 454, and attempted to stabilize its European borders under a deluge of barbarians, foremost of which were Attila and the Huns. One of his greatest achievements was the assembling of the coalition against Attila. Regarding this, historian Arther Ferrill states:

While J. B. Bury viewed Aetius as a great military commander and a prominent historical figure, he did not consider the battle itself to be particularly decisive. He argues that Aetius attacked the Huns when they were already retreating from Orléans (so the danger to Gaul was departing anyway); and he declined to renew the attack on the Huns next day, precisely in order to preserve the balance of power. (Others suggest that the Huns may have abandoned the siege of Orléans &quot;because&quot; Aetius&#x27;s armies were advancing on them.) Bury suggests that the Germanic victory over the Huns at the Battle of Nedao, three years later, was more important. This determined that there would be no long-term Hun empire in Europe, which Bury thinks would have been unlikely even if they had crushed the Germanic tribes on that occasion. For Bury, the result of the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains determined chiefly that Attila spent his last year looting Italy, rather than Gaul.

Modern authors typically overlook the battle and focus on the greater impact of Aetius&#x27; career, and he is generally seen as one of the greatest Roman military commanders of all time, as well as an excellent diplomat and administrator. Meghan McEvoy states that the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains is more a testament to his political aptitude than his military skill due to his foresight in the ability to provision treaties and obligations. John Julius Norwich caustically referred to the assassination of Valentinian III by his own guards as an act that Valentinian brought on himself by his foolish execution of Aetius, the &quot;Empire&#x27;s greatest commander.&quot; Hugh Elton notes that Aetius and his army were one of the most effective Roman armies to have existed, with its speed and mobility pointing to a highly efficient logistical and manpower resupply system not directly evidenced by the sources. It is generally seen that the rapid fragmentation and collapse of the West after his death was a testament to his ability to hold the empire together.

=== Controversies ===
Aetius&#x27; legacy has been filled with controversy somewhat similar to that of Stilicho as both left the Empire significantly weaker when they died. Like Stilicho&#x27;s critics pointing towards his inability or unwillingness to deal with usurpation in Britain, Gaul and Spain, and the Rhine crossing of 406, critics of Aetius point towards the civil wars of 427–433 that allowed for the Vandal crossing to Africa and its eventual loss, and Aetius&#x27; inability to retake Carthage. Hughes attempts to address this, pointing out that Felix was responsible for the war that allowed for the Vandal crossing, and that the Romans did attempt to deal with it on several occasions, including Bonifacius in 429–432, Aspar in 430–435, and Aetius in 441. Heather states that the rise of Attila ultimately led to the loss of Africa as the Eastern Roman army and navy, which was bearing the brunt of the cost for the expedition, had to be recalled to the Balkans. Halsall argues that the black mark on Aetius&#x27; career was his mixed success in Spain, where the majority of the province was lost by 449, although he later rectified this. Hughes states that:


=== In popular culture ===
Aetius appears in several popular works of historical fiction, usually as a foil for Attila the Hun. The earliest known appearance is in 1728, in the libretto Ezio (the Italian variation of Aetius). This libretto, in which Ezio becomes involved in a plot to kill Attilla, has been set to music by several different composers. Verdi&#x27;s 1846 opera &quot;Attila&quot; tells the same story, though with a different libretto.

The struggle between Aetius and Attila is also depicted in Thomas B. Costain&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;The Darkness and the Dawn&quot; and William Napier&#x27;s &quot;Attila&quot; trilogy. Polish writer Teodor Parnicki wrote a historical novel &quot;Aetius, the Last Roman&quot; (1937).

In the 1954 Italian-French film production &quot;Attila, Scourge of God&quot;, Aetius is portrayed by Henri Vidal. In the 2001 American TV Miniseries &quot;Attila&quot;, Aetius is portrayed by Powers Boothe as a former mentor and friend to Attila who becomes his nemesis. At the same time, he is depicted as the only general capable of keeping the empire standing and facing Attila as an equal.

<text>Paul Abraham Dukas ( 1 October 1865 – 17 May 1935) was a French composer, critic, scholar and teacher. A studious man of retiring personality, he was intensely self-critical, having abandoned and destroyed many of his compositions. His best-known work is the orchestral piece &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;apprenti sorcier&quot;), the fame of which has eclipsed that of his other surviving works, largely due to its usage in the 1940 Disney film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Among these are the opera &quot;Ariane et Barbe-bleue&quot;, his Symphony in C and Piano Sonata in E-flat minor, the &quot;Variations, Interlude and Finale on a Theme by Rameau&quot; (for solo piano), and a ballet, &quot;La Péri&quot;.

At a time when French musicians were divided into conservative and progressive factions, Dukas adhered to neither but retained the admiration of both. His compositions were influenced by composers including Beethoven, Berlioz, Franck, d&#x27;Indy and Debussy.

In tandem with his composing career, Dukas worked as a music critic, contributing regular reviews to at least five French journals. Later in his life he was appointed professor of composition at the Conservatoire de Paris and the École Normale de Musique; his pupils included Maurice Duruflé, Olivier Messiaen, Walter Piston, Manuel Ponce, Joaquín Rodrigo and Xian Xinghai.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Dukas was born in Paris, the second son in a Jewish family of three children. His father, Jules Dukas, was a banker, and his mother, Eugénie, was a capable pianist. When Dukas was five years old, his mother died giving birth to her third child, Marguerite-Lucie. Dukas took piano lessons but showed no unusual musical talent until he was 14 when he began to compose while recovering from an illness. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at the end of 1881, aged 16, and studied piano with Georges Mathias, harmony with Théodore Dubois and composition with Ernest Guiraud. Among his fellow students was Claude Debussy, with whom Dukas formed a close friendship. Two early overtures survive from this period, &quot;Goetz de Berlichingen&quot; (1883) and &quot;Le Roi Lear&quot; (1883). The manuscript of the latter was rediscovered in the 1990s and the work was performed for the first time in 1995.

Dukas won several prizes, including the second place in the Conservatoire&#x27;s most prestigious award, the Prix de Rome, for his cantata &quot;Velléda&quot; in 1888. Disappointed at his failure to win the top prize, he left the Conservatoire in 1889. After compulsory military service he began a dual career as a composer and a music critic.

===1890s===
Dukas&#x27;s career as a critic began in 1892 with a review of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; conducted by Gustav Mahler at Covent Garden in London. His review was published in &quot;La Revue Hebdomadaire&quot;; he later wrote also for &quot;Minerva&quot;, &quot;La Chronique des Arts&quot;, &quot;Gazette des Beaux-Arts&quot; and &quot;Le Courrier Musical&quot;. His Parisian debut as composer was a performance of his overture &quot;Polyeucte&quot;, written in 1891 and premiered by Charles Lamoureux and his Orchestre Lamoureux in January 1892. Based on a tragedy by Corneille, the work, like many French works of the period, shows the influence of Wagner, but is coherent and displays some individuality.
Although Dukas wrote a fair amount of music, he was a perfectionist and destroyed many of his pieces out of dissatisfaction with them. Only a few of his compositions remain. After &quot;Polyeucte&quot;, he began writing an opera in 1892. He wrote his own libretto, &quot;Horn et Riemenhild&quot;, but he composed only one act, &quot;realising too late that the work&#x27;s developments were more literary than musical&quot;.

The Symphony in C major was composed in 1895–96, when Dukas was in his early 30s. It is dedicated to Paul Vidal, and had its first performance in January 1896, under the direction of the dedicatee. In a study of Dukas published towards the end of the composer&#x27;s life, Irving Schwerké wrote, &quot;The work … is an opulent expression of modernism in classical form. Its ideational luxuriance, nobility of utterance and architectural solidity mark it as one of the most conspicuous achievements of contemporaneous writing, and magnificently refute the generally prevalent notion that no French composer has ever produced a great symphony.&quot;
Like Franck&#x27;s only symphony, Dukas&#x27;s is in three movements rather than the conventional four. Schwerké wrote of it:

The work received a mixed reception at its first performance. Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht, later known as a conductor, was a member of the orchestra at the premiere, and wrote, &quot;the work which nowadays seems to us so lucid aroused not only the protestations of the public, but also those of the musicians of the orchestra.&quot; The symphony was better received when the Lamoureux Orchestra revived it in 1902.

The symphony was followed by another orchestral work, by far the best known of Dukas&#x27; compositions, his scherzo for orchestra, &quot;L&#x27;apprenti sorcier&quot; (&quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;) (1897), a short piece (lasting for between 10 and 12 minutes in performance) based on Goethe&#x27;s poem &quot;Der Zauberlehrling&quot;. During Dukas&#x27;s lifetime &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot; commented that the world fame of the work not only overshadowed all other compositions by Dukas, but also eclipsed Goethe&#x27;s original poem. The popularity of the piece became a matter of irritation to Dukas. In 2011, the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; observed, &quot;The popularity of &quot;L&#x27;apprenti sorcier&quot; and the exhilarating film version of it in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; possibly hindered a fuller understanding of Dukas, as that single work is far better known than its composer.&quot;

===20th-century works===

In the decade after &quot;L&#x27;apprenti sorcier&quot;, Dukas completed two complex and technically demanding large-scale works for solo piano: the Piano Sonata (1901), dedicated to Saint-Saëns, and &quot;Variations, Interlude and Finale on a Theme by Rameau&quot; (1902). In Dukas&#x27;s piano works critics have discerned the influence of Beethoven, or, &quot;Beethoven as he was interpreted to the French mind by César Franck&quot;. Both works were premiered by Édouard Risler, a celebrated pianist of the era. There are also two smaller works for piano solo. The Sonata, described by the critic Edward Lockspeiser as &quot;huge and somewhat recondite&quot;, did not enter the mainstream repertoire, but it has been more recently championed by such pianists as Marc-André Hamelin and Margaret Fingerhut. Lockspeiser describes the &quot;Rameau Variations&quot; as more developed and assured ... Dukas infuses the conventional form with a new and powerful spirit.&quot;

In 1899 Dukas turned once again to operatic composition. His second attempt, &quot;L&#x27;arbre de science&quot;, was abandoned, incomplete, but in the same year he began work on his one completed opera, &quot;Ariane et Barbe-bleue&quot; (&quot;Ariadne and Bluebeard&quot;). The work is a setting of a libretto by Maurice Maeterlinck. The author had intended the libretto to be set by Grieg but in 1899 he offered it to Dukas. Dukas worked on it for seven years and it was produced at the Opéra-Comique in 1907. The opera has often been compared to Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; which was first performed while Dukas was writing &quot;Ariane et Barbe-bleue&quot;. Not only are both works settings of Maeterlinck, but there are musical similarities; Dukas even quotes from the Debussy work in his score. Although it won considerable praise, its success was overshadowed by the Paris premiere of Richard Strauss&#x27;s sensational opera &quot;Salome&quot; at much the same time. Nonetheless, within a short time of its premiere, Dukas&#x27;s opera was produced in Vienna, where it aroused much interest in Schoenberg&#x27;s circle, and in Frankfurt, Milan and New York. It did not maintain a regular place in the repertory, despite the advocacy of Arturo Toscanini, who conducted it in New York three years in succession, and Sir Thomas Beecham, who pronounced it &quot;one of the finest lyrical dramas of our time,&quot; and staged it at Covent Garden in 1937. Interest in it revived in the 1990s, with productions in Paris (Théâtre du Châtelet, 1990) and Hamburg (Staatsoper, 1997), and at the Opéra Bastille in Paris in 2007.

Dukas&#x27;s last major work was the sumptuous oriental ballet &quot;La Péri&quot; (1912). Described by the composer as a &quot;poème dansé&quot; it depicts a young Persian prince who travels to the ends of the Earth in a quest to find the lotus flower of immortality, coming across its guardian, the Péri (fairy). Because of the very quiet opening pages of the ballet score, the composer added a brief &quot;Fanfare pour précéder &quot;La Peri&quot;&quot; which gave the typically noisy audiences of the day time to settle in their seats before the work proper began. &quot;La Péri&quot; was written for the Russian-French dancer Natalia Trouhanova, who starred in the first performance at the Châtelet in 1912. Diaghilev planned a production with his Ballets Russes but the production did not take place; the company&#x27;s choreographer Fokine staged &quot;L&#x27;apprenti sorcier&quot; as a ballet in 1916.

In 1916, Dukas married Suzanne Pereyra (1883-1947), who was of Portuguese descent. They had one child, a daughter Adrienne-Thérèse, born in December 1919. 

===Later years===

In the last years of his life, Dukas became well known as a teacher of composition. When Charles-Marie Widor retired as professor of composition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1927, Dukas was appointed in his place. He also taught at the École Normale de Musique in Paris. His many students included Jehan Alain, Elsa Barraine, Yvonne Desportes, Francis Chagrin, Carlos Chávez, Maurice Duruflé, Georges Hugon, Jean Langlais, Olivier Messiaen, Walter Piston, Manuel Ponce, Joaquín Rodrigo, David Van Vactor and Xian Xinghai. As a teacher he was conservative but always encouraging of talent, telling one student, &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that you really love music. Always remember that it should be written from the heart and not with the head.&quot; He said his method of teaching was &quot;to help young musicians to express themselves in accordance with their own natures. Music necessarily has to express something; it is also obliged to express somebody, namely, its composer.&quot; &quot;Grove&quot; observes that his wide knowledge of the history of European music, and his editorial work on Rameau, Scarlatti and Beethoven, gave him &quot;particular authority in teaching historical styles&quot;.

After &quot;La Péri&quot;, Dukas completed no new large-scale compositions, although, as with his contemporary Jean Sibelius, there were frequent reports of major work in hand. After several years of silence, in 1920 he produced a tribute to his friend Debussy in the form of &quot;La plainte, au loin, du faune...&quot; for piano, which was followed by &quot;Amours&quot;, a setting of a sonnet by Pierre de Ronsard, for voice and piano, published in 1924 to mark the four hundredth anniversary of the poet&#x27;s birth. Shortly before his death he had been working on a symphonic poem inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, a play of which he had made a French translation in 1918 with an operatic version in mind.

In the last year of his life Dukas was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. Though adhering to neither the progressive nor conservative factions among French musicians of the era, Dukas had the friendship and respect of both. In 1920, Vincent d&#x27;Indy published a study of Dukas&#x27;s music; Debussy remained a lifelong friend, though feeling that Dukas&#x27;s music was not French enough; Saint-Saëns worked with Dukas to complete an unfinished opera by Guiraud, and they were both engaged in the rediscovery and editing of the works of Jean-Philippe Rameau; Fauré dedicated his Second Piano Quintet to Dukas in 1921.

In 1920, he became a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.

Dukas died in Paris in 1935, aged 69. He was cremated and his ashes were placed in the columbarium at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

<doc id="75837" wikidata="Q210573" url="?curid=75837" title="Hippias">
<text>Hippias of [[Elis (city)|Elis]] (; ; late 5th century BC) was a Greek sophist, and a contemporary of Socrates. With an assurance characteristic of the later sophists, he claimed to be regarded as an authority on all subjects, and lectured on poetry, grammar, history, politics, mathematics, and much else. Most current knowledge of him is derived from Plato, who characterizes him as vain and arrogant.

==Life==
Hippias was born at Elis in the mid 5th-century BC (c. 460 BC) and was thus a younger contemporary of Protagoras and Socrates. He lived at least as late as Socrates (399 BC). He was a disciple of Hegesidamus. Owing to his talent and skill, his fellow-citizens availed themselves of his services in political matters, and in a diplomatic mission to Sparta. But he was in every respect like the other sophists of the time: he travelled about in various towns and districts of Greece for the purpose of teaching and public speaking. The two dialogues of Plato, the &quot;Hippias major&quot; and the &quot;Hippias minor&quot; characterize him as vain and arrogant. The &quot;Hippias major&quot; (the authorship of this work by Plato is sometimes doubted) concerns the question about the beautiful, and purposely puts the knowledge and presumption of Hippias in a ludicrous light. The &quot;Hippias minor&quot; discusses the deficiency of human knowledge, and characterizes Hippias as ridiculously vain.

==Work==
Hippias was a man of very extensive knowledge, and he occupied himself not only with rhetorical, philosophical, and political studies, but was also well versed in poetry, music, mathematics, painting and sculpture, and he claimed some practical skill in the ordinary arts of life, for he used to boast of wearing on his body nothing that he had not made himself with his own hands, such as his seal-ring, his cloak, and shoes. He was credited with a lost work known as the &quot;Olympionikō̂n Anagraphḗ&quot; () which computed Coroebus&#x27;s victory as occurring in 776  and became the basis of all later lists of the Olympiads and their victors. On the other hand, his knowledge always appears superficial, he does not enter into the details of any particular art or science, and is satisfied with certain generalities, which enabled him to speak on everything without a thorough knowledge of any. This arrogance, combined with ignorance, is the main cause which provoked Plato to his severe criticism of Hippias, as the sophist enjoyed a very extensive reputation, and thus had a large influence upon the education of the youths of the higher classes. Plutarch also criticized Hippias in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Life of Numa&quot; in &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; when writing about the chronology of Numa&#x27;s relationship with Pythagoras, mentioning that the chronology was based on the &quot;Olympionikō̂n Anagraphḗ&quot; and stating that Hippias had no authoritative basis on his work. A mathematical discovery ascribed to Hippias is sometimes called the quadratrix of Hippias.

His great skill seems to have consisted in delivering grand show speeches; and Plato has him arrogantly declaring that he would travel to Olympia, and there deliver before the assembled Greeks an oration on any subject that might be proposed to him; and Philostratus in fact speaks of several such orations delivered at Olympia, and which created great sensation. If such speeches were published by Hippias, then no specimen has come down to us. Plato claims he wrote epic poetry, tragedies, dithyrambs, and various orations, as well as works on grammar, music, rhythm, harmony, and a variety of other subjects. He seems to have been especially fond of choosing antiquarian and mythical subjects for his show speeches. Athenaeus mentions a work of Hippias under the title &quot;Synagoge&quot; which is otherwise unknown. An epigram of his is preserved in Pausanias.

==Natural law==
Hippias is credited with originating the idea of natural law. This ideal began at first during the 5th century BC. According to Hippias, natural law was never to be superseded as it was universal. Hippias saw natural law as a habitual entity that humans take part in without pre-meditation. He regarded the elite in states as indistinguishable from one another and thus they should perceive each other as so. Because of this, he reasons, they should consider and treat each other as a society of a unanimous state. These ideas were passed on through Cynicism and Stoicism, later being the foundation for turning Roman law in legislation. Along with natural law, Hippias also wrote about self-sufficiency as a binding principle. He used this principle in his teachings as he gathered knowledge in numerous subjects, so as to be never outwitted or have his reputation questioned.

<doc id="75838" wikidata="Q165447" url="?curid=75838" title="Pen">
<text>A pen is a common writing instrument that applies ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. Early pens such as reed pens, quill pens, dip pens and ruling pens held a small amount of ink on a nib or in a small void or cavity that had to be periodically recharged by dipping the tip of the pen into an inkwell. Today, such pens find only a small number of specialized uses, such as in illustration and calligraphy. Reed pens, quill pens and dip pens, which were used for writing, have been replaced by ballpoint pens, rollerball pens, fountain pens and felt or ceramic tip pens. Ruling pens, which were used for technical drawing and cartography, have been replaced by technical pens such as the Rapidograph. All of these modern pens contain internal ink reservoirs, such that they do not need to be dipped in ink while writing.

==Types==
===Modern===
Pens commonly used today can be categorized based on the mechanism of the writing tip and the type of ink:

* A ballpoint pen dispenses a viscous oil-based ink by means of a small hard sphere, or ball, which rolls over the surface being written on. The ball is held captive in a socket at the tip of the pen with one half exposed and the other half immersed in ink from the pen&#x27;s reservoir. When the ball rotates, it transfers the ink - which wets the ball - from the reservoir to the external surface. The ball is typically under a millimeter in diameter and made of brass, steel, or tungsten carbide. The ink, due to its high viscosity, does not permeate through paper and does not leave the tip of the pen by capillary action. As such, a bare minimum amount of ink is dispensed, with the result that the writing dries almost instantly and ink lasts longer than it does in other types of pen. Ballpoint pens are reliable, versatile and robust, and are available for a very wide range of prices. They have replaced fountain pens as the most common tool for everyday writing.
* A gel pen works similarly to a ballpoint pen, in that it dispenses ink using a rolling ball held in the writing tip. However, unlike oil-based ballpoint pen ink, gel pen ink consists of a water-based gel that has a pigment suspended in it. Because the ink is thick and opaque, it shows up more clearly on dark or slick surfaces than the typical inks used in ballpoint or felt tip pens. Gel pens can be used for many types of writing and illustration. Since the gel medium eliminates the constraints of a soluble dye, many new colors are made possible, as well as some special types of ink; gel pens are available in a wide range of vibrant or saturated colors, in pastel colors, in neon colors, in metallic colors, in glitter inks, in glow-in-the-dark ink, and so on.
* A rollerball pen is a pen that dispenses a water-based ink through a ball tip similar to that of a ballpoint pen. As such, gel pens might be considered a subcategory of rollerball pens; however, due to the widespread knowledge and use of the term &#x27;gel pen&#x27;, &#x27;rollerball&#x27; is in practice typically reserved for pens which use liquid ink. The lower viscosity of rollerball ink compared to oil-based ballpoint pen ink has several effects on the pen&#x27;s performance. Since the ink flows more easily and is more easily absorbed into paper, more ink is dispensed in general. This changes the writing experience by lubricating the motion of the tip over the paper. It also results in a solid and uninterrupted line, since the diffusion of the ink through the paper fills small gaps that might otherwise be left by the ball point. Compared to ballpoint pens, which dispense a smaller amount of more viscous ink, the writing by a rollerball pen takes longer to dry on the page and can seep through thin paper such as to become visible on the opposite side. When the tip of a rollerball pen is held against paper, ink leaves the tip continually by capillary action in much the same way as would occur with a fountain pen. This can lead to ink blots or smears. The rollerball pen was initially designed to combine the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the smooth &quot;wet ink&quot; effect of a fountain pen. Refillable rollerball pens have recently become available; these generally use cartridges of fountain pen ink.
* A felt-tip pen, or marker, has a porous tip made of fibrous material, which normally remains saturated with ink from the reservoir. As ink leaves the tip, new ink is drawn from the reservoir - which often consists of a large volume of a similar porous material to that used in the tip - by capillary action and gravity. As with a fountain pen, ink leaves the tip of a felt tip pen by capillary action when writing on a porous surface. However, unlike fountain pens, many markers can also reliably write on slick impermeable surfaces that are wet by the ink, and in such applications ink typically does not continually leave the pen as it is held against the writing surface. The smallest, finest-tipped felt-tip pens are used for writing on paper. Medium-sized felt-tips are often used by children for coloring and drawing. Larger types, often called &quot;markers&quot;, are used for writing in larger sizes, often on surfaces other than paper such as corrugated boxes and whiteboards. Specialized felt-tip pens referred to by names such as &quot;liquid chalk&quot; or &quot;chalkboard markers&quot; are used to write on chalkboards. Markers with wide tips and bright but transparent ink, called &quot;highlighters&quot;, are used to highlight text that has already been written or printed. Pens designed for children or for temporary writing (as with a whiteboard or overhead projector) typically use non-permanent inks. Large markers used to label shipping cases or other packages are usually permanent markers.
*A brush pen is a pen whose writing tip consists of a small brush fed with ink from a liquid ink reservoir similar to those used in fountain pens and rollerball pens. Brush pens might be either refillable or disposable, and might use either water-based or waterproof ink. The most significant functional difference of brush pens from felt-tip pens is the far greater compliance of the tip. Brush pens are an obvious alternative to ink brushes for Chinese calligraphy and Japanese calligraphy, but are now also commonly used in other forms of calligraphy and by artists such as illustrators and cartoonists. The primary appeal of these pens to such artists is that they allow a great deal of line width variation in response to small changes in applied pressure.
* A stylus pen, plural styli or styluses, is a writing utensil which does not use ink, but rather makes marks primarily by creating scratches or indentations in the writing surface. As such, the tip often consists simply of a sharp metal point. Such tools are also used for other types of marking than writing, and for shaping or carving in, for example, pottery. The word stylus also refers to a pen-shaped computer accessory that is used to achieve greater precision when using touchscreens than generally possible with a fingertip. There are products available that combine a ballpoint tip at one end and a touchscreen stylus at the other.

===Historic===
These historic types of pens are no longer in common use as writing instruments, but may be used by calligraphers and other artists:
* A fountain pen uses water-based liquid ink delivered through a &quot;nib&quot;, which is in general a flat piece of metal with a thin slit extending inwards from the writing tip. Driven by gravity, the ink flows from a reservoir to the nib through a &quot;feed&quot;, which is in general a specially shaped solid block of material with channels and grooves cut into it. The feed delivers the ink to the slit in the nib. While writing, ink is pulled out of this slit by capillary action. A fountain pen nib, unlike the tip of a ballpoint, gel or rollerball pen, has no moving parts. A fountain pen reservoir can be refillable or disposable; the disposable type is called an &quot;ink cartridge&quot;. A pen with a refillable reservoir may have a mechanism such as a piston to draw ink from a bottle through the nib, or it may require refilling with an eye dropper. Refillable reservoirs, also known as &quot;cartridge converters&quot;, are available for some pens otherwise designed to use disposable cartridges. A fountain pen can be used with permanent or non-permanent inks.
* A dip pen (or &quot;nib pen&quot;) consists of a metal nib with capillary channels, like that of a fountain pen, mounted on a handle or holder, often made of wood. A dip pen is called such because it usually has no ink reservoir and must therefore be repeatedly dipped into an inkpot in order to recharge the nib with ink while drawing or writing. The dip pen has certain advantages over a fountain pen; it can use waterproof pigmented (particle-and-binder-based) inks, such as so-called &quot;India ink&quot;, drawing ink, or acrylic inks, which would destroy a fountain pen by clogging, as well as the traditional iron gall ink, which can cause corrosion in a fountain pen. Dip pens are now mainly used in illustration, calligraphy, and comics. A particularly fine-pointed type of dip pen known as a &quot;crowquill&quot; is a favorite instrument of artists such as David Stone Martin and Jay Lynch, because its flexible metal point can create a variety of delicate lines, textures and tones in response to variation of pressure while drawing.
* The ink brush is the traditional writing implement in East Asian calligraphy. The body of the brush can be made from bamboo, or from rarer materials such as red sandalwood, glass, ivory, silver, and gold. The head of the brush can be made from the hair (or feathers) of a wide variety of animals, including the weasel, rabbit, deer, chicken, duck, goat, pig, and tiger. There is also a tradition both in China and in Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir for the child. This practice is associated with the legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who ranked first in the Imperial examinations using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher&#x27;s arm. Today, calligraphy may also be done using a pen, but pen calligraphy does not enjoy the same prestige as traditional brush calligraphy.
* A quill is a pen made from a flight feather of a large bird, most often a goose. To make a quill, a feather must be cured through aging or heat-treatment, after which a nib is fashioned from the shaft by cutting a slit in it and carving away the sides to create a pointed tip. With practice, suitable feathers can be made into quills quickly and cheaply using no more than a small knife and a source of heat. Due to their easy availability, quills remained the writing instruments of choice in the West for a long time—from the 6th century to the 19th—before the metal dip pen, the fountain pen, and eventually the ballpoint pen came to be manufactured in large numbers. Quills, like later metal-nibbed dip pens, must periodically be dipped in ink while writing.
* A reed pen is cut from a reed or bamboo, with a slit in a narrow tip. Its mechanism is essentially the same as that of a quill or a metal dip pen. The reed pen has almost disappeared but is still used by young school students in some parts of India and Pakistan, who learn to write with them on small timber boards known as &quot;Takhti&quot;.
* A paper pen, invented by Nasima Akhtar in 2007 from Jashore, Bangladesh, is an eco-friendly writing instrument made from paper. These pens are biodegradable and contain seeds at their base, allowing them to be planted after use to grow into various plants.

==History==

Ancient Egyptians had developed writing on papyrus scrolls when scribes used thin reed brushes or reed pens from the &quot;Juncus maritimus&quot; or sea rush. In his book &quot;A History of Writing&quot;, Steven Roger Fischer suggests, on the basis of finds at Saqqara, that the reed pen might well have been used for writing on parchment as long ago as the First Dynasty, or around 3000 BC. Reed pens continued to be used until the Middle Ages, but were slowly replaced by quills from about the 7th century. The reed pen, made from reed or bamboo, is still used in some parts of Pakistan by young students and is used to write on small wooden boards.

The reed pen survived until papyrus was replaced as a writing surface by animal skins, vellum and parchment. The smoother surface of skin allowed finer, smaller writing with a quill pen, derived from the flight feather. The quill pen was used in Qumran, Judea to write some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which date back to around 100 BC. The scrolls were written in Hebrew dialects with bird feathers or quills. There is a specific reference to quills in the writings of St. Isidore of Seville in the 7th century. Quill pens were still widely used in the eighteenth century, and were used to write and sign the Constitution of the United States in 1787.

A copper nib was found in the ruins of Pompeii, showing that metal nibs were used in the year 79. There is also a reference to &#x27;a silver pen to carry ink in&#x27;, in Samuel Pepys&#x27; diary for August 1663. &#x27;New invented&#x27; metal pens are advertised in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1792. A metal pen point was patented in 1803, but the patent was not commercially exploited. A patent for the manufacture of metal pens was advertised for sale by Bryan Donkin in 1811. John Mitchell of Birmingham started to mass-produce pens with metal nibs in 1822, and after that, the quality of steel nibs improved enough so that dip pens with metal nibs came into general use.

The earliest historical record of a pen with a reservoir dates back to the 10th century AD. In 953, Ma&#x27;ād al-Mu&#x27;izz, the Fatimid Caliph of Egypt, demanded a pen which would not stain his hands or clothes, and was provided with a pen which held ink in a reservoir and delivered it to the nib. This pen may have been a fountain pen, but its mechanism remains unknown, and only one record mentioning it has been found. A later reservoir pen was developed in 1636. In his &quot;Deliciae Physico-Mathematicae&quot; (1636), German inventor Daniel Schwenter described a pen made from two quills. One quill served as a reservoir for ink inside the other quill. The ink was sealed inside the quill with cork. Ink was squeezed through a small hole to the writing point. In 1809, Bartholomew Folsch received a patent in England for a pen with an ink reservoir.

A student in Paris, Romanian Petrache Poenaru invented a fountain pen that used a quill as an ink reservoir. The French Government patented this in May 1827. Fountain pen patents and production then increased in the 1850s.

The first patent on a ballpoint pen was issued on October 30, 1888, to John J. Loud. In 1938, László Bíró, a Hungarian newspaper editor, with the help of his brother George, a chemist, began to design new types of pens, including one with a tiny ball in its tip that was free to turn in a socket. As the pen moved along the paper, the ball rotated, picking up ink from the ink cartridge and leaving it on the paper. Bíró filed a British patent on June 15, 1938. In 1940, the Bíró brothers and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, moved to Argentina, fleeing Nazi Germany. On June 17, 1943, they filed for another patent. They formed &quot;Bíró Pens of Argentina&quot;, and by the summer of 1943, the first commercial models were available. Erasable ballpoint pens were introduced by Paper Mate in 1979, when the Erasermate was put on the market.

Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, a Croatian engineer and inventor, became renowned for further development of the mechanical pencil (1906) – then called an &quot;automatic pencil&quot; – and the first solid-ink fountain pen (1907). Collaborating with the Croatian entrepreneur Edmund Moster, he started the Penkala-Moster Company and built a pen-and-pencil factory that was one of the biggest in the world at the time. This company, now called &quot;TOZ-Penkala&quot;, still exists today. &quot;TOZ&quot; stands for &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Zagreb Pencil Factory&quot;.

In the 1960s, the fiber- or felt-tipped pen was invented by Yukio Horie of the Tokyo Stationery Company, Japan. Paper Mate&#x27;s Flair was among the first felt-tip pens to hit the U.S. market in the 1960s, and it has been the leader ever since. Marker pens and highlighters, both similar to felt pens, have become popular in recent times.

Rollerball pens were introduced in the early 1970s. They use a mobile ball and liquid ink to produce a smoother line. Technological advances during the late 1980s and early 1990s have improved the roller ball&#x27;s overall performance. A porous point pen contains a point made of some porous material such as felt or ceramic. A high quality drafting pen will usually have a ceramic tip, since this wears well and does not broaden when pressure is applied while writing.
Although the invention of the typewriter and personal computer with the keyboard input method has offered another way to write, the pen is still the main means of writing. Many people like to use expensive types and brands of pens, including fountain pens, and these are sometimes regarded as a status symbol.

<text>Aquileia is an ancient Roman city in Italy, at the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about from the sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has changed somewhat since Roman times. Today, the city is small (about 3,500 inhabitants), but it was large and prominent in classical antiquity as one of the world&#x27;s largest cities with a population of 100,000 in the second century AD and is one of the main archaeological sites of northern Italy. In late antiquity the city was the first city in the Italian Peninsula to be sacked by Attila the Hun.

It is currently a (municipality) in the Regional decentralization entity of Udine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia.

==History==
=== Classical Antiquity ===
====Roman Republic====
Aquileia was founded as a colony by the Romans in 180/181 BC along the Natiso River, on land south of the Julian Alps but about north of the lagoons. The colony served as a strategic frontier fortress at the north-east corner of transpadane Italy (on the far side of the Po river) and was intended to protect the Veneti, faithful allies of Rome during the invasion of Hannibal in the Second Punic War and during the Illyrian Wars. The colony would serve as a citadel to check the advance into Cisalpine Gaul of other warlike peoples, such as the hostile Carni to the northeast in what is now Carnia and Histri tribes to the southeast in what is now Istria. In fact, the site chosen for Aquileia was about from where an estimated 12,000 Celtic Taurisci nomads had attempted to settle in 183 BC. However, since the thirteenth century BC, the site, on the river and at the head of the Adriatic, had also been of commercial importance as the end of the Baltic amber (&quot;sucinum&quot;) trade. It is, therefore, theoretically not unlikely that Aquileia had been a Gallic &quot;oppidum&quot; even before the coming of the Romans. However, few Celtic artefacts have been discovered from 500 BC to the Roman arrival.

The colony was established with Latin Rights by the triumvirate of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, Caius Flaminius, and Lucius Manlius Acidinus, two of whom were of consular and one of praetorian rank. Each of the men had first-hand knowledge of Cisalpine Gaul. Nasica had conquered the Boii in 191. Flaminius had overseen the construction of the road named after him from Bononia (Bologna) to Arretium (Arezzo). Acidinus had conquered the Taurisci in 183.

The triumvirate led 3,000 families to settle the area meaning Aquileia probably had a population of 20,000 soon after its founding. Meanwhile, based on the evidence of names chiselled on stone, the majority of colonizing families came from Picenum, Samnium, and Campania, which also explains why the colony was &quot;Latin&quot; and not &quot;Roman&quot;. Among these colonists, &quot;pedites&quot; received 50 &quot;iugera&quot; of land each, &quot;centuriones&quot; received 100 &quot;iugera&quot; each, and &quot;equites&quot; received 140 &quot;iugera&quot; each. Either at the founding or not long afterwards, colonists from the nearby Veneti supplemented these families.

Roads soon connected Aquileia with the Roman colony of Bologna probably in 173 BC. In 148 BC, it was connected with Genua by the &quot;Via Postumia&quot;, which stretched across the Padanian plain from Aquileia through or near to Opitergium, Tarvisium, Vicetia, Verona, Bedriacum, and the three Roman colonies of Cremona, Placentia, and Dertona. The construction of the &quot;Via Popilia&quot; from the Roman colony of Ariminium to Ad Portum near Altinum in 132 BC improved communications still further. In the first century, the &quot;Via Gemina&quot; would link Aquileia with Emona to the east of the Julian Alps, and by 78 or 79 the &quot;Via Flavia&quot; would link Aquileia to Pula.

Meanwhile, in 169 BC, 1,500 more Latin colonists with their families, led by the triumvirate of Titus Annius Lucius, Publius Decius Subulo, and Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, settled in the town as a reinforcement to the garrison. The discovery of the gold fields near the modern Klagenfurt in 130 BC brought the growing colony into further notice, and it soon became a place of importance, not only owing to its strategic military position, but as a centre of commerce, especially in agricultural products and viticulture. It also had, in later times at least, considerable brickfields.

In 90 BC, the original Latin colony became a &quot;municipium&quot; and its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe Velina. The customs boundary of Italy was close by in Cicero&#x27;s day. Julius Caesar visited the city on a number of occasions and pitched a winter camp nearby in 59–58 BC.

==== Roman Empire ====
Although the Iapydes plundered Aquileia during the Augustan period, subsequent increased settlement and no lack of profitable work meant the city was able to develop its resources. Jewish artisans established a flourishing trade in glass-work. Metal from Noricum was forged and exported. The ancient Venetic trade in amber from the Baltic continued. Wine, especially its famous &quot;Pucinum&quot; was exported. Olive oil was imported from Proconsular Africa. By sea, the port of Aquae Gradatae &quot;(&quot;modern Grado) was developed. On land, Aquileia was the starting-point of several important roads leading outside Italy to the north-eastern portion of the empire — the road (&quot;Via Julia Augusta&quot;) by Iulium Carnicum (Zuglio) to Veldidena (mod. Wilten, near Innsbruck), from which branched off the road into Noricum, leading by Virunum (Klagenfurt) to Laurieum (Lorch) on the Danube, the road leading via Emona into Pannonia and to Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica), the road to Tarsatica (near Fiume, now Rijeka) and Siscia (Sisak), and the road to Tergeste (Trieste) and the Istrian coast.

Augustus was the first of a number of emperors to visit Aquileia, notably during the Pannonian wars in 12–10 BC. It was the birthplace of Tiberius&#x27; son by Julia, in the latter year. The Roman poet Martial praised Aquileia as his hoped-for haven and resting place in his old age.

In terms of religion, the populace adopted the Roman pantheon, although the Celtic sun-god, Belenus, had a large following. Jews practiced their ancestral religion. Meanwhile, soldiers brought the martial cult of Mithras.

In the war against the Marcomanni in 167, the town was hard pressed; its fortifications had fallen into disrepair during the long peace. Nevertheless, when in 168 Marcus Aurelius made Aquileia the principal fortress of the empire against the barbarians of the North and East, it rose to the pinnacle of its greatness and soon had a population of 100,000. Septimius Severus visited in 193. In 238, when the town took the side of the Senate against the emperor Maximinus Thrax, the fortifications were hastily restored, and proved of sufficient strength to resist for several months, until Maximinus himself was assassinated.

=== Late Antiquity ===
An imperial palace was constructed in Aquileia, in which the emperors after the time of Diocletian frequently resided.
During the fourth century, Aquileia maintained its importance. Constantine sojourned there on numerous occasions. It became a naval station and the seat of the &quot;Corrector Venetiarum et Histriae&quot;. A mint was established, of which the coins were very numerous. The bishop of the Diocese of Aquileia obtained the rank of metropolitan archbishop. A council held in the city in 381 was only the first of a series of Councils of Aquileia that have been convened over the centuries. However, the city played a part in the struggles between the rulers of the fourth century. In 340, the emperor Constantine II was killed nearby while invading the territory of his younger brother Constans.
At the end of the fourth century, Ausonius enumerated Aquileia as the ninth among the great cities of the world, placing Rome, Constantinople, Carthage, Antioch, Alexandria, Trier, Mediolanum, and Capua before it. However, such prominence made it a target and Alaric and the Visigoths besieged it in 401, during which time some of its residents fled to the nearby lagoons. Alaric again attacked it in 408. Attila attacked the city in 452. During this invasion, on July 18, Attila and his Huns so utterly destroyed the city that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site. The fall of Aquileia was the first of Attila&#x27;s incursions into Roman territory; followed by cities like Mediolanum and Ticinum. The Roman inhabitants, together with those of smaller towns in the neighbourhood, fled &quot;en masse&quot; to the lagoons, where they laid the foundations of the cities of Venice and nearby Grado.

Yet Aquileia would rise again, though much diminished, and continue to exist until the Lombards invaded in 568; the Lombards destroyed it a second time in 590. Meanwhile, the patriarch fled to the island town of Grado, which was under the protection of the Byzantines. When the patriarch residing in Grado reconciled with Rome in 606, those continuing in the Schism of the Three Chapters, rejecting the Second Council of Constantinople, elected a patriarch at Aquileia. Thus, the diocese was essentially divided into two parts, with the mainland patriarchate of Aquileia under the protection of the Lombards, and the insular patriarchate of Aquileia seated in Grado being protected by the exarchate of Ravenna and later the Doges of Venice, with the collusion of the Lombards. The line of the patriarchs elected in Aquileia would continue in schism until 699. However, although they kept the title of patriarch of Aquileia, they moved their residence first to Cormons and later to Cividale.

=== Middle Ages ===
The Lombard dukes of Friuli ruled Aquileia and the surrounding mainland territory from Cividale. In 774, Charlemagne conquered the Lombard duchy and made it into a Frankish one with Eric of Friuli as duke. In 787, Charlemagne named the priest and &quot;master of grammar&quot; at the Palace School of Paulinus II, the new patriarch of Aquileia. The patriarchate, despite being divided with a northern portion assigned to the pastoral care of the newly created Archbishopric of Salzburg, would remain one of the largest dioceses. Although Paulinus resided mainly at Cividale, his successor Maxentius considered rebuilding Aquileia. However, the project never came to fruition.

While Maxentius was patriarch, the pope approved the Synod of Mantua, which affirmed the precedence of the mainland patriarch of Aquileia over the patriarch of Grado. However, material conditions were soon to worsen for Aquileia. The ruins of Aquileia were continually pillaged for building material. And with the collapse of the Carolingians in the tenth century, the inhabitants would suffer under the raids of the Magyars.

By the eleventh century, the patriarch of Aquileia had grown strong enough to assert temporal sovereignty over Friuli and Aquileia. The Holy Roman Emperor gave the region to the patriarch as a feudal possession. However, the patriarch&#x27;s temporal authority was constantly disputed and assailed by the territorial nobility.

In 1027 and 1044, Patriarch Poppo of Aquileia, who rebuilt the cathedral of Aquileia, entered and sacked neighbouring Grado, and, though the Pope reconfirmed the Patriarch of the latter in his dignities, the town never fully recovered, though it continued to be the seat of the Patriarchate until its formal transference to Venice in 1450.

In the fourteenth century, the Patriarchal State reached its largest extension, stretching from the Piave river to the Julian Alps and northern Istria. The seat of the Patriarchate of Aquileia had been transferred to Udine in 1238, but returned to Aquileia in 1420 when Venice annexed the territory of Udine.

In 1445, the defeated patriarch Ludovico Trevisan acquiesced in the loss of his ancient temporal estate in return for an annual salary of 5,000 ducats allowed him from the Venetian treasury. Henceforth only Venetians were allowed to hold the title of Patriarch of Aquileia. The Patriarchal State was incorporated in the Republic of Venice with the name of &quot;Patria del Friuli&quot;, ruled by a &quot;provveditore generale&quot; or a &quot;luogotenente&quot; living in Udine. The Patriarchal diocese was only finally officially suppressed in 1751, and the sees of Udine and Gorizia were established from its territory.

==Main sights==
===Cathedral===

Aquileia Cathedral is a flat-roofed basilica that was erected by Patriarch Poppo in 1031 on the site of an earlier church and rebuilt in the Gothic style by Patriarch Marquard of Randeck (1365-1381).

===Ancient Roman Remains===

Today, Aquileia is a town that is smaller than it was when the colony was first founded by Rome. Over the centuries, sieges, earthquakes, floods and pillaging of the ancient buildings for materials mean that no building from the Roman period remain above ground. The site of Aquileia is believed to be the largest Roman city yet to be excavated and is on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Excavations, however, have revealed some of the layout of the Roman town like a segment of a street, the north-western angle of the town walls; the river port; and the former locations of baths, an amphitheatre, a circus, a cemetery, the &quot;Via Sacra&quot;, the forum and a market. The National Archaeological Museum of Aquileia contains over 2,000 inscriptions, statues and other antiquities and mosaics, as well as glasses of local production and a collection.

===Others===
In the Monastero fraction is a fifth-century Christian basilica, later a Benedictine monastery, which now houses the Palaeo-Christian Museum. Another Byzantine-style basilica, expanded in the 6th century under Justinian, was discovered at the site in 2024.

<text>The Iapodes (or Iapydes, Japodes; ; ) were an ancient people who dwelt north of and inland from the Liburnians, off the Adriatic coast and eastwards of the Istrian peninsula. They occupied the interior of the country between the &quot;Colapis&quot; (Kupa) and &quot;Oeneus&quot; (Una) rivers, and the Velebit mountain range (&quot;Mons Baebius&quot;) which separated them from the coastal Liburnians. Their territory covered the central inlands of modern Croatia and Una River Valley in today&#x27;s Bosnia and Herzegovina. Archaeological documentation confirms their presence in these countries at least from 9th century BC, and they persisted in their area longer than a millennium. The ancient written documentation on inland Iapodes is scarcer than on the adjacent coastal peoples (Liburni, Delmatae, etc.) that had more frequent maritime contacts with ancient Greeks and Romans.

The Iapodes had their maximal development and territorial expansion from the 8th to 4th centuries BC. They settled mostly in inland mountain valleys between Pannonia and the coastal Adriatic basin, but in disputation with southern &quot;Liburni&quot; they periodically reached also the northern Adriatic coast at Vinodol valley (classical &quot;Valdevinum&quot;).

Knowledge of the Iapodes&#x27; culture is largely nebulous due to a lack of material evidence. The Iapodes are believed to have been Illyrians, probably a subgroup of Pannonians, or a mixed group with connections to the Pannonians, Celts, and/or Veneti.

A major scholar of the Japodi was archaeologist Branka Raunig.
==Origin and affinity==
The exact origin of early Iapodes is uncertain; archaeological documentation suggests mixed affinities to early &quot;Pannonii&quot; and other Illyrians. The first written mention of an Illyrian tribe is from Greek writers from the 6th century BC. They are provisionally described by Strabo as a mixed race of Celts and Illyrians, who used Celtic weapons, tattooed themselves, and lived chiefly on spelt and millet; however, Strabo&#x27;s suggestion of a mixed Celtic-Illyrian Iapodes culture is not confirmed by archaeology. Originally, Iapodes existed at least from the 9th century BC, and Celtic influence reached the region in the 4th century BC when Iapodes entered a decline. Archeological evidence of typical Celtic culture is documented only in the marginal contact zone of the Iapodes and the Celtic &quot;Taurisci&quot; along the Kupa river valley (now the Slovenian-Croatian border). Elsewhere, and especially in the main Iapodian area of the Lika highlands in Croatia, definite Celtic artifacts are scarce and explicable merely by commercial exchanges.

==Roman conquest==
Romans said of the Iapodes that they were a warlike race addicted to plundering expeditions, but other archaeological documentation confirms their main economical activity was mining and metallurgy. That attracted the pragmatic Romans to conquer their country, whose river valleys were also a natural way for strategic communications between the Adriatic and Pannonia. Therefore, induced conflicts started from 171 BC, when consul Gaius Cassius Longinus first attacked Iapodes. In 129 BC, Gaius Sempronius Tuditanus attacked the Iapodes and was nearly defeated, but Decimus Iunius Brutus arrived and rescued him, and he celebrated a triumph. Lucius Aurelius Cotta and Gaius Caecilius Metellus undertook another expedition against the Iapodes in 119, which concluded with a triumph in 117. In 78–76 BC they were also attacked by Gaius Cosconius as part of a war against the Dalmatians. They had a &quot;foedus&quot; from 56 BC with Rome and paid a &quot;tributum&quot;, but then from 52–47 BC rebelled. In 34 BC they were finally conquered by Augustus Caesar. Then they conserved a partial autonomy with a domestic &quot;praepositus Iapodum&quot;.

==Culture and society==

Due to the rich and extensive forests of their mountainous country, their houses were mostly wooden huts, and they rarely used stone constructions except in some major fortifications. Their settlements were mostly on hilltops, including between 400–3,000 dwellers, and the main Iapodian settlements in Roman times were &quot;Metulum&quot;, &quot;Terpon&quot;, &quot;Arupium&quot; and &quot;Avendo&quot;.

They cultivated chiefly cereals and grapes, and kept varied cattle. Their early metallurgy developed a half millennium before Celtic influence that induced here minor modifications. Their society was simple including warriors, villagers, herdsmen, miners, and metalworkers. In that early phase neither leaders nor elite were indicated, and these independent Iapodes had no detectable collective political organisation. Under the Romans, a Romanized elite emerged, led by the &quot;praepositus Iapodum&quot; installed by Romans.

Their classical culture was a varied mixture of Pannonian, Illyrian, Greek and Roman influences, mostly without proper peculiarities. Their figural art included the frequent metal decorations in the form of triangles and spirals, and large amber pearls and amber figurines. The Iapodian language before the Romans is mostly unknown: the only indications available are their toponyms and necropolis inscriptions from Roman times. These scarce onomastic indications suggest the Iapodian tongue may be correlated with other Illyrian and Pannonian tribes. During their independence, the Iapodes appear to have been completely illiterate and left no inscriptions before the Roman conquest.

==Religion==

The original religion of Iapodes is scarcely known, and it appears to be similar with other eastward Illyrians. They knew the divine pair of water-deities &quot;Vidassus&quot; (as Roman Sylvanus) and &quot;Thana&quot; (as Roman Diana), whose rocky reliefs persist today at some springs in their area. They worshiped the holy horse as their tribal totem, and also the holy snakes as the symbol of their ancestors. Their early tombs were usually in caves, and then in Roman times often in wooden sarcophagi and also incinerated in ceramic urns.

Japodian burial urns were art a unique form influenced to a degree by the Situla art of northern Illyria and Italy and by Greek art.

==Archaeogenetics==
A archaeogenetic studies published in &quot;Nature&quot; (2022) examined 8 samples from three Early Iron Age Iapodes sites. All five tested men belonged to the Y-DNA haplogroup patrilineal line J2b2a1-L283 (&gt; J-Y86930). The mtDNA haplogroups fell under H, H1, 2x H3b, H5, T2a1a, T2b and U5a1g.

<text>Quercus marilandica, the blackjack oak, is a small oak, one of the red oak group &quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Lobatae&quot;. It is native to the eastern and central United States.

==Description==
&quot;Quercus marilandica&quot; is a small deciduous tree growing to tall, with bark cracked into rectangular black plates with narrow orange fissures. The leaves are long and broad, and typically flare from a tapered base to a broad three-lobed bell shape with only shallow indentations. They are dark green and glossy above, pubescent underneath, and often remain attached to the twigs through the winter after turning colors from red to brown in the fall. The acorn is small, long and broad; like those of other red oaks, it takes 18 months to mature.

Blackjack oaks in the Cross Timbers can grow from high but seldom reach more than , with a trunk diameter of . The leaves are from in length and about the same width.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The blackjack oak can be found from Long Island in New York to Florida, west as far as Texas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. There are reports of a few isolated populations in southern Michigan, but these appear to represent introductions.

The species grows in poor, thin, dry, rocky or sandy soils where few other woody plants can thrive, usually on low ground, from sea level up to approximately in altitude. Some sources say that it does not have the beautiful form of many oaks, but is nonetheless a valuable tree for growing in problem sites. Some say that the tree is &quot;tough but ugly&quot;, but also underappreciated. At times the tree has even been actively eradicated to provide room for trees deemed to be more commercially valuable.

It is sometimes an understory tree in pine stands on sandy knolls in the southeastern US. Along the coastal plain of New Jersey the probability of finding this species is increased in relatively sunny, open areas such as those near coastal salt marshes. It often occurs near scarlet and post oaks as well as pitch pine; understory companions include winged sumac, bracken, sweetfern, and bayberry, and can be found as far north as parts of Ohio and New York.

A variety, &quot;Quercus marilandica&quot; Münchhausen var. &quot;ashei&quot; Sudworth, grows in the western portions of its range – northern Texas, Oklahoma, and into southern Kansas. In this area, blackjack and post oak form a semi-savanna area composed of forested strips intermixed with prairie grass glades along the eastern edge of the southern Great Plains. This semi-savanna is known as the Cross Timbers. Scrub forms of &quot;Q. marilandica&quot; dominate on many chert glades along with &quot;Q. stellata&quot; in Arkansas&#x27;s Ozark plateau.

== Ecology ==
Blackjack oak sometimes hybridizes with bear oak (&quot;Q. ilicifolia&quot;), forming a hybrid known as &quot;Q.&quot; × &quot;brittonii&quot;.

Blackjack acorns provide food for both whitetail deer and wild turkey. Blackjacks may, however, cause tannic acid poisoning in cattle.

==Uses==
The wood is very dense and produces a hot flame when burned, which functions as an excellent source of heat for barbecues and wood-burning stoves. However, the wood is not desirable for wood fireplaces because the heat causes popping, thereby increasing the risk of house fires.

Traditionally blackjack wood is used as both a fuel and smoke wood for barbecue in Oklahoma.

<text>Capua ( ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Caserta, in the region of Campania, southern Italy, located on the northeastern edge of the Campanian plain.

==History==

===Ancient era===
The name of Capua comes from the Etruscan &quot;Capeva&quot;. The meaning is &#x27;City of Marshes&#x27;. Its foundation is attributed by Cato the Elder to the Etruscans, and the date given as about 260 years before it was &quot;taken&quot; by Rome. If this is true it refers not to its capture in the Second Punic War (211 BC), but to its submission to Rome in 338 BC. This places the date of foundation at about 600 BC, while Etruscan power was at its highest. In the area, several settlements of the Villanovian civilization were present in prehistoric times. These were probably enlarged by the Oscans, and subsequently by the Etruscans.

Etruscan supremacy in Campania came to an end with the Samnite invasion, in the latter half of the 5th century BC.

In about 424 BC Capua was captured by the Samnites, and in 343 BC sought Roman help against its conquerors. They allied for protection against the Samnite mountain tribes, along with its dependent communities Casilinum, Calatia, Atella, so that the greater part of Campania now fell under Roman supremacy. The citizens of Capua received the (citizenship without the vote).

In the second Samnite War with Rome, Capua proved an untrustworthy Roman ally, so that after the defeat of the Samnites, the Ager Falernus on the right bank of the Volturnus was confiscated. In 318 BC the powers of the native officials () were limited by the appointment of officials with the title &quot;praefecti Capuam Cumas&quot; (taking their name from the most important towns of Campania); these were at first mere deputies of the &quot;praetor urbanus&quot;, but after 123 BC were elected Roman magistrates, four in number; they governed the whole of Campania until the time of Augustus, when they were abolished. It was the capital of &quot;Campania Felix&quot;.

In 312 BC, Capua was connected with Rome by the construction of the &quot;Via Appia&quot;, the most important of the military highways of Italy. The gate by which it left the Servian walls of Rome bore the name &quot;Porta Capena&quot;; perhaps the only case in which a gate in this line of fortifications bears the name of the place to which it led. At some time the &quot;Via Latina&quot; was extended to Casilinum. It afforded a route only longer, and the difficulties with its construction were much less; it also avoided the troublesome journey through the Pontine Marshes.

The importance of Capua increased steadily during the 3rd century BC, and at the beginning of the Second Punic War it was considered to be only slightly behind Rome and Carthage themselves, and was able to furnish 30,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. Until after the defeat of Cannae it remained faithful to Rome, but, after an unsuccessful demand that one of the consuls should always be selected from it (or perhaps in order to secure regional supremacy in the event of a Carthaginian victory), it defected to Hannibal. He made it his winter quarters, and he and his army were voluntarily received by Capua. Livy and others have suggested that the luxurious conditions were Hannibal&#x27;s &quot;Cannae&quot; because his troops became soft and demoralized by luxurious living. Historians from Reginald Bosworth Smith onwards have been skeptical of this, observing that his troops gave as good an account of themselves in battle after that winter as before. After a long siege, Capua was taken by the Romans in 211 BC and severely punished in the Second Battle of Capua; its magistrates and communal organization were abolished, the inhabitants who weren&#x27;t killed lost their civic rights, and its territory was declared (Roman state domain). Parts of it were sold in 205 BC and 199 BC, another part was divided among the citizens of the new colonies of Volturnum and Liternum, established near the coast in 194 BC, but the greater portion of it was reserved to be let by the state.

Considerable difficulties occurred in preventing illegal encroachments by private persons, and it became necessary to buy a number of them out in 162 BC. It was, after that period, let, not to large but to small proprietors. Frequent attempts were made by the democratic leaders to divide the land among new settlers. M. Junius Brutus the Elder in 83 BC actually succeeded in establishing a colony, but it was soon dissolved; and Cicero&#x27;s speeches &quot;De Lege Agrania&quot; were directed against a similar attempt by Servilius Rullus in 63 BC.

In the meantime the necessary organization of the inhabitants of this thickly populated district was in a measure supplied by grouping them round important shrines. Many inscriptions testify to a associated with the shrine to Diana Tifatina; a is also known.

The town of Capua belonged to none of these organizations, and was entirely dependent on the . It enjoyed great prosperity, however, due to their growing of spelt, a grain that was put into groats, wine, roses, spices, unguents etc., and also owing to its manufacture, especially of bronze objects, of which both the elder Cato and the elder Pliny speak in the highest terms.

Its luxury remained proverbial, and Campania was especially spoken of as the home of gladiatorial combat. From the gladiatorial schools of Campania came Spartacus and his followers in 73 BC. Julius Caesar as consul in 59 BC succeeded in carrying out the establishment of a Roman colony under the name Julia Felix in connection with his agrarian law, and 20,000 Roman citizens were settled in this territory.

The number of colonists was increased by Mark Antony, Augustus (who constructed an aqueduct from the &quot;Mons Tifata&quot; and gave the town of Capua estates in the district of Knossos in Crete valued at 12 million sesterces) and Nero.

In the war of 69 AD Capua took the side of Vitellius. Under the later empire it is not often mentioned, but in the 4th century it was the seat of the &quot;consularis Campaniae&quot; and its chief town, though Ausonius put it behind Mediolanum (Milan) and Aquileia in his &quot;ordo nobilium urbium&quot;.

===Middle Ages===

Under Constantine, a Christian church was founded in Capua. In 456, it was taken and destroyed by the Vandals under Gaiseric, but was likely soon rebuilt.

During the Gothic War, Capua suffered greatly. When the Lombards invaded Italy in the second half of the 6th century, Capua was ravaged; later, it was included in the Duchy of Benevento, and ruled by an official styled gastald.

In 839, the prince of Benevento, Sicard, was assassinated by Radelchis I of Benevento, who took over the throne. Sicard&#x27;s brother Siconulf was proclaimed independent prince in Salerno and the gastald of Capua declared himself independent.

In 840, ancient Capua was burned to the ground by a band of Saracen mercenaries called by Radelchis I of Benevento with only the church of Santa Maria Maggiore (founded about 497) remaining (which was purposely spared by the invading Muslims, whose policy was that to leave houses of worship alone). A new city was built in 856, but at some distance from the former site, where another town later appeared under the name of Santa Maria Capua Vetere (&quot;Capua the Old&quot;).

Prince Atenulf I conquered Benevento in 900 and united the principalities until 981, when Pandulf Ironhead separated them in his will for his children. Capua eclipsed Benevento thereafter and became the chief rival of Salerno. Under Pandulf IV, the principality brought in the aid of the Normans and, for a while had the loyalty of Rainulf Drengot, until the latter abandoned him to aid the deposed Sergius IV of Naples take back his city, annexed by Pandulf in 1027.

Upon Pandulf&#x27;s death, Capua fell to his weaker sons and, in 1058, the city itself fell in a siege to Rainulf&#x27;s nephew Richard I, who took the title Prince of Aversa. For seven years (1091–1098), Richard II was exiled from his city, but with the aid of his relatives, he retook the city after a siege in 1098. His dynasty lived on as princes of Capua until the last claimant of their line died in 1156 and the principality was definitively united to the kingdom of Sicily. In the 1230s, King Frederick I built the monumental City Gate of Capua.

In the early 1500s, it was reported to Pope Alexander VI that his son, Cesare Borgia, had captured the city and promptly killed all 6,000 citizens, which included women and children, while commanding French troops during the sieges of Naples and Capua.

===Modern Age===

On 3 January 1799, during the French Revolutionary Wars, this community was successfully attacked by a French-controlled 1798–1799 Roman Republic Army led by Governor MacDonald.
The Battle of Volturnus (1860), at the conclusion of Garibaldi&#x27;s Expedition of the Thousand, partially took place in and around Capua. Prior to the battle, the Neapolitan army, defeated in earlier engagements, was rebuilt in Capua under marshal Giosuè Ritucci. After fighting elsewhere in which the Neapolitans were ultimately defeated, the last of them—around 3,000 troops under Colonel Perrone—were holed up in Capua. The city was attacked by the Garibaldines and one Piedmontese regular Bersaglieri battalion, and captured. In the referendum several months later, its inhabitants voted overwhelmingly to join the new Kingdom of Italy.

==Main sights==
* The cathedral of Santo Stefano, erected in 856, has a lofty campanile, and a renovated interior with three aisles; both it and the atrium have ancient granite columns. The Romanesque crypt, with ancient columns, has also been restored. It has a fine paschal candlestick, and the fragments of a pulpit with marble mosaic of the 13th century. There are also preserved in the cathedral a fine &quot;Exultet&quot; roll and an of the end of the 12th century, bound in bronze decorated with gold filigree and enamels. The mosaics of the beginning of the 12th century in the apses of the cathedral and of San Benedetto, were destroyed about 1720 and 1620 respectively.
* The small church of San Marcello was also built in 856. In 1232–1240 the emperor Frederick II erected a castle to guard the Roman bridge over the Volturnus, composed of a triumphal arch with two towers. This was demolished in 1557. The statues with which it was decorated were contemporary imitations of classical sculptures. Some of them were preserved in the Museo Campano.
* The (the Campania Provincial Museum of Capua) was founded in 1870 and opened to the public in 1874. Since then it has become a cultural reference point for the whole territory and Campania.

==Archaeological sites==

===Remains===
No pre-Roman remains have been found within the town of Capua itself, but important cemeteries have been discovered on all sides of it, the earliest of which go back to the 7th or 6th century BC.

The tombs are of various forms, partly chambers with frescoes on the walls, partly cubical blocks of peperino, hollowed out, with grooved lids. The objects found within them consist mainly of vases of bronze (many of them without feet, and with incised designs of Etruscan style) and of clay, some of Greek, some of local manufacture, and of paintings. On the east of the town, in the Patturelli property, a temple has been discovered with Oscan votive inscriptions originally thought to be Oscan, now recognized as Etruscan, some of them inscribed upon terracotta tablets, the most famous of which is the Tabula Capuana, conserved in Berlin, still, after more than a century of searching, the second-longest Etruscan text. Other brief inscriptions are on &quot;cippi&quot;. A group of 150 tuff statuettes represent a matron holding one or more children in her lap: three bore Latin inscriptions of the early Imperial period.

The site of the town being in a perfectly flat plain, without natural defences, it was possible to lay it out regularly. Its length from east to west is accurately determined by the fact that the &quot;Via Appia&quot;, which runs from north-west to south-east from Casilinum to Calatia, turns due east very soon after passing the so-called Arch of Hadrian (a triumphal arch of brickwork, once faced with marble, with three openings, erected in honour of some emperor unknown), and continues to run in this direction for (6,000 ancient Oscan feet).

The west gate was the &quot;Porta Romana&quot;; remains of the east gate have also been found, although its name is unknown. This fact shows that the main street of the town was perfectly oriented, and that before the &quot;Via Appia&quot; was constructed, i.e. in all probability in pre-Roman times. The width of the town from north to south cannot be so accurately determined as the line of the north and south walls is not known, though it can be approximately fixed by the absence of tombs. Beloch fixes it at 4,000 Oscan feet = , nor is it absolutely certain (though it is in the highest degree probable, for Cicero praises its regular arrangement and fine streets) that the plan of the town was rectangular.

Within the town are remains of public baths on the north of the Via Appia and of a theatre opposite, on the south. The former consisted of a large &quot;cryptoporticus&quot; round three sides of a court, the south side being open to the road; it now lies under the prisons. Beloch (see below) attributes this to the Oscan period; but the construction as shown in Labruzzi&#x27;s drawing (v. 17) 1 is partly of brick-work and opus reticulatum, which may, of course, belong to a restoration. The stage of the theatre had its back to the road; Labruzzi (v. 18) gives an interesting view of the cavea. It appears from inscriptions that it was erected after the time of Augustus.

Other inscriptions, however, prove the existence of a theatre as early as 94 BC. The Roman colony was divided into regions and possessed a &quot;capitolium&quot;, with a temple of Jupiter, within the town, and the marketplace, for unguents especially, was called Seplasia; an &quot;aedes alba&quot; is also mentioned, which is probably the original senate house, which stood in an open space known as albana. But the sites of all these are uncertain. A Mithraeum may also be seen, by appointment.

===Amphitheatre===
Outside the town, in Santa Maria Capua Vetere, there is the amphitheatre, built in the time of Augustus, restored by Hadrian and dedicated by Antoninus Pius, as the inscription over the main entrance recorded. The exterior was formed by 80 Doric arcades of four stories each, but only two arches now remain. The keystones were adorned with heads of divinities.

The interior is better preserved; beneath the arena are subterranean passages like those in the amphitheatre at Puteoli. It is one of the largest in existence; the longer diameter is , the shorter , and the arena measures , the corresponding dimensions in the Colosseum at Rome being 188, 155, 85, 53 metres (615, 510, 279 and 174 ft).

To the east are considerable remains of baths – a large octagonal building, an apse against which the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie is built, and several heaps of debris. On the Via Appia, to the south-east of the east gate of the town, arc two large and well-preserved tombs of the Roman period, known as &quot;le Carceri vecchie&quot; and &quot;la Conocchia&quot;.

To the east of the amphitheatre an ancient road, the &quot;Via Dianae&quot;, leads north to the Pagus Dianae, on the west slopes of the Mons Tifata, a community which sprang up around the famous and ancient temple of Diana, and probably received an independent organization after the abolition of that of Capua in 211 BC. The place often served as a base for attacks on the latter, and Sulla, after his defeat of Gaius Norbanus, gave the whole of the mountain to the temple.

Within the territory of the &quot;pagus&quot; were several other temples with their &quot;magistri&quot;. After the restoration of the community of Capua, &quot;magistri&quot; of the temple of Diana are still attested, but they were probably officials of Capua itself.

The site is occupied by the Benedictine church of &quot;San Michele Arcangelo&quot; in Sant&#x27;Angelo in Formis. It dates from 944, and was reconstructed by the abbot Desiderius (afterwards Pope Victor III) of Monte Cassino. It has interesting paintings, dating from the end of the 11th century to the middle of the 12th, in which five different styles may be distinguished. They form a complete representation of all the chief episodes of the New Testament. Deposits of votive objects (&quot;favissae&quot;), removed from the ancient temple from time to time as new ones came in and occupied all the available space, have been found, and considerable remains of buildings belonging to the &quot;Vicus Dianae&quot; (among them a triumphal arch and some baths, also a hail with frescoes, representing the goddess herself ready for the chase) still exist.

The ancient road from Capua went on beyond the &quot;Vicus Dianae&quot; to the Volturnus (remains of the bridge still exist) and then turned east along the river valley to Caiatia and Telesia. Other roads ran to Puteoli and Cumae (the so-called Via Campana) and to Neapolis, and the Via Appia passed through Capua, which was thus the most important road centre of Campania.

<doc id="75846" wikidata="Q1269660" url="?curid=75846" title="Publius Servilius Rullus">
<text>Publius Servilius Rullus was plebeian tribune of the Roman Republic in 63 BC. He proposed an agrarian law aimed at redistributing land for the landless poor in Rome to farm. We know about this through the speeches delivered by Marcus Tullius Cicero against this bill. Cicero delivered four speeches. Three are extant. The beginning of the first speech is missing. The fourth speech is lost. We do not have any other sources except for passing references by Plutarch and Suetonius.

==Agrarian bill==
The bill provided for the election of a ten-man commission (decemviri) which would have authority for five years. Its task was to distribute land to 5,000 colonists in lots of ten jugera in the ager Campanus and in lots of twelve jugera in the nearby campus Stellaris (both areas were in Campania, north of Naples). Further plots of land were intended and land was to be bought for this. To raise funds for this, the decemviri were empowered to sell public land whose sale had been recommended by senatus consulta (written advice by the senate) since 81 BC, but had not been carried out. It was also empowered to sell domains outside Italy which had become public property in 88 BC or later. The decimviri were also authorised to tax public land outside Italy, to use the Vectigalia from 63 BC and the gold and silver from war booty not paid into the treasury or spent on monuments. Military commanders gave some of their booty to the state treasury and spent some of it to build temples and public facilities or to erect statues. Pompey was exempted from this. He was commanding the Roman troops in the last phase of the Third Mithridatic War (73–63 BC) against Pontus and Armenia (in present-day eastern Turkey). Because of his absence from Rome he was not eligible to be a candidate for the election of the decemviri.

Cicero portrayed Publius Servilius Rullus as an insignificant figure and alleged that he was a front for unsavoury men he described as the real architects of the bill, as &#x27;machinators&#x27; and as the men who had the real power and were to be feared more than Rullus. He claimed that they hoped to become decemviri. He did not name these men, but dropped hints which made them identifiable. He said that among those men who were after joining the commission there would be &quot;some of them to whom nothing appears sufficient to possess, some to whom nothing seems sufficient to squander.&quot; The first was a reference to the popular image of Marcus Licinius Crassus and the second one referred to the popular image of Julius Caesar. The speeches of Cicero need to be understood in terms of the frictions between two political factions, the populares (in favour of the people) and the optimates (the good men). The former favoured the plebeians (the commoners), wanted to address the problems of the urban poor and promoted reforms which would help them, particularly the redistribution of land for the landless poor to farm and the problem of indebtedness. The latter was a conservative faction which favoured the patricians (the aristocracy). It opposed the mentioned reforms. It also wanted to limit the power of the plebeian tribunes and the Plebeian Council (the assembly of the plebeians) and strengthen the power of the senate, which represented the patricians. At that time Crassus and Caesar were leading figures of the populares. Cicero was a leading figure of the optimates and as such he was opposed to the bill.

Cicero exaggerated the power which the land commission would be given by the bill. He described the commission as &quot;... ten Kings of the treasury, of the revenues, of all provinces, of the whole Republic, of the kingdoms allied with us, the free nations confederate with us - in fact, ten Lords of the world are to be set up under the pretence and name of an agrarian law.&quot; He also exaggerated the implications of the commission&#x27;s power to sell domains outside Italy which had become public property. He claimed that &quot;all nations, and people, and provinces, and kingdoms, are given up and handed over to the dominion, and judgment, and power of the decimviri … and asked … what place there is anywhere in the world which the decemviri may not be able to say has been made the property of the Roman people [public property]?&quot; He also alleged that all the lands and cities in Asia which had been ‘recovered’ by Sulla and Pompey in Asia would be declared public property and sold by the commissioners. He said Lucius Cornelius Sulla (the commander in the First Mithridatic War, 89–85 BC) had recovered land in Asia. However, Sulla had fought and recovered territories only in Greece. There was no land which was Roman public property or could be declared as such in Greece. He said that Pompey also recovered land in Asia. After winning the Third Mithridatic War Pompey annexed Cilicia Trachea, part of Pontus (both in today&#x27;s Turkey), and Syria. However, these were annexations, rather than recoveries of territories. Moreover, at the time of the bill the war was still on and Pompey&#x27;s settlements in Asia were yet to be completed. Sumner points out that by mos maiorum the adjudication and control of the estates in the acquired territories were to rest with Pompey. Hence, here Cicero&#x27;s statements were contentious and part of effort to purport that Crassus and Caesar wanted to use the bill to prepare for a conflict with Pompey (see below).

==Interpretations==
There are various interpretations of the political motivations of this agrarian bill among various historians. 1) The most common one is that Crassus and Caesar sought to seize power through a coup d’ état against Pompey and/or the senate or that they were after command in Egypt to enable them to fight Pompey. 2) Crassus wanted to control the allotment of land so that he would have a strong bargaining position when Pompey came back from the war and sought land for his veterans (soldiers were entitled to a grant of a plot of land on their discharge); 3) The bill was a bribery scheme to provide profits for the merchants and a new tax source for the publicani (these were private tax collectors, the republican state tendered this collection to private tax collectors who used their position to line their pockets and for extortion); 4) The bill was never meant to be passed and served to show up Cicero in his true colours, as an optimate-lover, rather than consul in favour of the people and to heighten the conflict between the plebeians and the senate. 5) The purpose of the bill was genuinely to give land to the landless poor. According to this view, this was intended to rid Rome of these people who were seen as idle and dangerous and improve the security of the city. Conspiracy theories are unlikely and based on the rhetoric of Cicero and on the remarks of Plutarch and Suetonius. These two later writers had pro-aristocracy views and always portrayed the plebeian tribunes in a negative light. As for Cicero&#x27;s speeches, their rhetoric appears to be designed to undermine support for the bill.

Cicero tried to give a conspiratorial hue to the bill. He alleged that the architects of the bill were against both Pompey and himself. He said that they hoped to use the powers of the commissioners to allot land to discharged soldiers to take away from Pompey his right to give his veterans land and, through this, the support of his veterans. He added that he was concerned that they would do so during his term as consul to undermine him because they despised him. This is what interpretations 2 and 4 rest on. Cicero repeatedly made his claim about an anti-Pompeian agenda. He said that the commissions would &quot;in the first place take care that Gnaeus [Pompey] should be removed from all power of protecting your [the people&#x27;s] liberty, from all power to promote, from all commission to watch over, and from all means of protecting your interests [,]&quot; and that they thought it &quot;expedient to oppose Gnaeus [Pompey] as your defence against all defects and wickednesses in the law.&quot; He called the commissioners &quot;Ten general against Pompey.&quot; Cicero was also at pain to present himself as a consul who stood for the people and not for the aristocrats or the optimantes: &quot;I have been made consul, not by the zeal of the powerful citizens, nor by the preponderating influence of a few men, but by the deliberate judgment of the Roman people, and that, too, in such a way as to be preferred to men of the very highest rank, to avoid, both in this magistracy and throughout my whole life, devoting myself to the interests of the people.&quot; He presented himself as a man who stood in opposition against men who pretended to stand in the interests of the people but were in fact a danger to the people (this was a reference to the populares): &quot;For there is a great error abroad, by reason of the treacherous pretences made by some people, who, though they oppose and hinder not only the advantage but even the safety of the people, still endeavour by their speeches to make men believe them zealous for the interests of the people.&quot;

To further bolster his speeches, Cicero claimed that the Publius Rullus would sell Alexandria and Egypt. In 65 BC there was a proposal to annex Egypt. This was made by the plebeian tribunes. According to Suetonius Julius Caesar, who wanted to get the command in Egypt, put them up to it. According to Plutarch, instead, Crassus promoted this. Both Plutarch and Suetonius wrote over 160 years after these events. The proposal was made on the basis of a claim that Ptolemy Alexander I of Egypt bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Cicero said: &quot;I know that there is a resolution of the senate extant to the effect that it accepted the inheritance … [Publius Servilius Rullus] will also, in accordance with his own law, sell Alexandria, and sell Egypt. He will be found to be the judge, the arbiter, the master, of a most wealthy city, and of a most beautiful country; yes, he will be found to be the king of a most opulent kingdom. Will he abstain from taking all this? from desiring all this? He will decide that Alexandria belongs to the king; he will by his sentence deprive the Roman people of it.&quot; In the last part of the sentence Cicero implied that, should Egypt be annexed, the plebeian tribune and the other decemviri would use the sale of Alexandria and Egypt for their own profit.

Sumner points out that the proposal to annex Egypt by some plebeian tribunes in 65 BC had been rejected and that the commission would have to have the annexation approved by the senate or the assembly of the people. The bill did leave the possibility of annexation open by setting the cut off for the selling of domains outside Italy which had been seen as public property form 88 BC onward. This was the year in which Ptolemy Alexander I was deposed. However, not only the annexation would have to be approved by either of the mentioned bodies, so would the declaration of the royal property in Egypt as Roman public property. Thus, as Sumner notes, the bill did not allow the land commission &#x27;to go and grab Egypt&#x27;. One this could add to this that the law did not allow the land commission to make a declaration on public land. The annexation of Egypt was a very unlikely scenario. Even in such a case, Sumner points out that the most likely Roman commander who would have benefited would have been Pompey, who was already in the east and was ending the war there. He would have been the best positioned man to handle the annexation of Egypt. Moreover, the 65 BC proposal to annex Egypt occurred during the period of ascendancy of Pompey and followed the Gabinian Law (67 BC), which gave Pompey extraordinary proconsular powers in any province within 50 miles of the Mediterranean Sea to deal with the problem of piracy, and the 66 BC Manilian Law (which Cicero had supported), which gave Pompey the mandate to replace the previous Romans commander in the Third Mithridatic War and gave him supreme command in the last phase of this war. Sumner also notes that the opponents to these two laws were optimates and that Julius Caesar had supported them. The planned coup d&#x27; état interpretation of the political motivations behind the bill is based on the idea that Caesar was after the command of Egypt after its annexation.

==Fate of the bill==
The bill did not pass the vote. Cicero opposed subsequent proposals for agrarian laws to redistribute land. In 59 BC Julius Caesar managed to pass a law which gave land to 20,000 Roman citizens with more than three children in Campania, in the same area which had been earmarked for redistribution by the bill of Publius Servilius Rullus. Caesar managed to do so thanks to the enormous political power of the First Triumvirate, the informal political alliance Caesar made with Crassus and Pompey.

<doc id="75847" wikidata="Q93227" url="?curid=75847" title="Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov">
<text>Nikolai Andreyevich Rimsky-Korsakov (18 March 1844 – 21 June 1908) was a Russian composer, a member of the group of composers known as The Five. He was a master of orchestration. His best-known orchestral compositions—&quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot;, the &quot;Russian Easter Festival Overture&quot;, and the symphonic suite &quot;Scheherazade&quot;—are staples of the classical music repertoire, along with suites and excerpts from some of his fifteen operas. &quot;Scheherazade&quot; is an example of his frequent use of fairy-tale and folk subjects.

Rimsky-Korsakov believed in developing a nationalistic style of classical music, as did his fellow composer Mily Balakirev and the critic Vladimir Stasov. This style employed Russian folk song and lore along with exotic harmonic, melodic and rhythmic elements in a practice known as musical orientalism, and eschewed traditional Western compositional methods. Rimsky-Korsakov appreciated Western musical techniques after he became a professor of musical composition, harmony, and orchestration at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1871. He undertook a rigorous three-year program of self-education and became a master of Western methods, incorporating them alongside the influences of Mikhail Glinka and fellow members of The Five. Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s techniques of composition and orchestration were further enriched by his exposure to the works of Richard Wagner.

For much of his life, Rimsky-Korsakov combined his composition and teaching with a career in the Russian armed forces—first as an officer in the Imperial Russian Navy, then as the civilian Inspector of Naval Bands. He wrote that he developed a passion for the ocean in childhood from reading books and hearing of his older brother&#x27;s exploits in the navy. This love of the sea may have influenced him to write two of his best-known orchestral works, the musical tableau &quot;Sadko&quot; (not to be confused with his later opera of the same name) and &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. As Inspector of Naval Bands, Rimsky-Korsakov expanded his knowledge of woodwind and brass playing, which enhanced his abilities in orchestration. He passed this knowledge to his students, and also posthumously through a textbook on orchestration that was completed by his son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg.

Rimsky-Korsakov left a considerable body of original Russian nationalist compositions. He prepared works by The Five for performance, which brought them into the active classical repertoire (although there is controversy over his editing of the works of Modest Mussorgsky), and shaped a generation of younger composers and musicians during his decades as an educator. Rimsky-Korsakov is therefore considered &quot;the main architect&quot; of what the classical-music public considers the &quot;Russian style&quot;. His influence on younger composers was especially important, as he served as a transitional figure between the autodidactism exemplified by Glinka and The Five, and professionally trained composers, who became the norm in Russia by the closing years of the 19th century. While Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s style was based on those of Glinka, Balakirev, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and, for a brief period, Wagner, he &quot;transmitted this style directly to two generations of Russian composers&quot; and influenced non-Russian composers including Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, Paul Dukas, and Ottorino Respighi.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Rimsky-Korsakov was born in Tikhvin, east of Saint Petersburg, into a Russian noble family. Tikhvin was a town of Novgorod Governorate at that time.

Throughout history, members of the family served in Russian government and took various positions as governors and war generals. Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov was famously a lover of Catherine the Great. By a Tsar&#x27;s decree on 15 May 1677, 18 representatives of the Korsakov family acquired the right to be called the Rimsky-Korsakov family (the Russian adjective &#x27;Rimsky&#x27; means &#x27;Roman&#x27;) since the family &quot;had a beginning within the Roman borders&quot;, i.e. Czech lands, which used to be a part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1390, Wenceslaus Korsak moved to the Grand Prince Vasily I of Moscow from the Duchy of Lithuania.

The father of the composer, (1784–1862), was one of the six illegitimate sons of Avdotya Yakovlevna, daughter of an Orthodox priest from Pskov, and lieutenant general Peter Voinovich Rimsky-Korsakov, who had to officially adopt his own children as he was unable to marry their mother because of her lower social status. Using his friendship with Aleksey Arakcheyev, he managed to grant them all the privileges of the noble family. Andrei went on to serve in the Interior Ministry of the Russian Empire, as vice-governor of Novgorod, and in the Volhynian Governorate. The composer&#x27;s mother, Sofya Vasilievna Rimskaya-Korsakova (1802–1890), was also born as an illegitimate daughter of a peasant serf and Vasily Fedorovich Skaryatin, a wealthy landlord who belonged to the noble Russian family that originated during the 16th century. Her father raised her in full comfort, yet under an improvised surname, Vasilieva, and with no legal status. By the time Andrei Petrovich met her, he was already a widower: his first wife, knyazna Ekaterina Meshcherskaya, died just nine months after their marriage. Since Skaryatin found him unsuitable for his daughter, Andrei secretly &quot;stole&quot; his bride from the father&#x27;s house and brought her to Saint Petersburg, where they married.

The Rimsky-Korsakov family had a long line of military and naval service. Nikolai&#x27;s older brother Voin, 22 years his senior, became a well-known navigator and explorer and had a powerful influence on Nikolai&#x27;s life. He later recalled that his mother played the piano a little, and his father could play a few songs on the piano by ear. Beginning at six, he took piano lessons from local teachers and showed a talent for aural skills, but he showed a lack of interest, playing, as he later wrote, &quot;badly, carelessly, ... poor at keeping time&quot;.

Although he started composing by age 10, Rimsky-Korsakov preferred literature to music. He later wrote that from his reading, and tales of his brother&#x27;s exploits, he developed a poetic love for the sea &quot;without ever having seen it&quot;. This love, with subtle prompting from Voin, encouraged the 12-year-old to join the Imperial Russian Navy. He studied at the School for Mathematical and Navigational Sciences in Saint Petersburg and at 18 took his final examination in April 1862.
While at school, Rimsky-Korsakov took piano lessons from a man named Ulikh. Voin, now director of the school, sanctioned these lessons because he hoped they would help Nikolai develop social skills and overcome his shyness. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that, while &quot;indifferent&quot; to lessons, he developed a love for music, fostered by visits to the opera and, later, orchestral concerts.

Ulikh perceived Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s musical talent and recommended another teacher, Feodor A. Kanille (Théodore Canillé). Beginning in late 1859, Rimsky-Korsakov took lessons in piano and composition from Kanille, whom he later credited as the inspiration for devoting his life to composition. Through Kanille, he was exposed to a great deal of new music, including Mikhail Glinka and Robert Schumann. Voin cancelled his brother Nikolai&#x27;s musical lessons when the latter reached age 17, feeling they no longer served a practical purpose.

Kanille told Rimsky-Korsakov to continue coming to him every Sunday, not for formal lessons but to play duets and discuss music. In November 1861, Kanille introduced the 18-year-old Nikolai to Mily Balakirev. Balakirev in turn introduced him to César Cui and Modest Mussorgsky; all three were known as composers, despite only being in their 20s. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, &quot;With what delight I listened to &quot;real business&quot; discussions [Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s emphasis] of instrumentation, part writing, etc! And besides, how much talking there was about current musical matters! All at once I had been plunged into a new world, unknown to me, formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends. That was truly a strong impression.&quot;

Balakirev encouraged Rimsky-Korsakov to compose and taught him the rudiments when he was not at sea. Balakirev prompted him to enrich himself in history, literature and criticism. When he showed Balakirev the beginning of a symphony in E-flat minor that he had written, Balakirev insisted he continue working on it despite his lack of formal musical training.

By the time Rimsky-Korsakov sailed on a two-year-and-eight-month cruise aboard the clipper &quot;Almaz&quot; in late 1862, he had completed and orchestrated three movements of the symphony. He composed the slow movement during a stop in England and mailed the score to Balakirev before going back to sea.

At first, his work on the symphony kept Rimsky-Korsakov occupied during his cruise. He purchased scores at every port of call, along with a piano on which to play them, and filled his idle hours studying Berlioz&#x27;s Treatise on Instrumentation. He found time to read the works of Homer, William Shakespeare, Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; he saw London, Niagara Falls, and Rio de Janeiro during his stops in port. Eventually, the lack of outside musical stimuli dulled the young midshipman&#x27;s hunger to learn. He wrote to Balakirev that after two years at sea he had neglected his musical lessons for months.

&quot;Thoughts of becoming a musician and composer gradually left me altogether&quot;, he later recalled; &quot;distant lands began to allure me, somehow, although, properly speaking, naval service never pleased me much and hardly suited my character at all.&quot;

===Mentored by Balakirev; time with The Five===

Once back in Saint Petersburg in May 1865, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s onshore duties consisted of a couple of hours of clerical duty each day, but he recalled that his desire to compose &quot;had been stifled ... I did not concern myself with music at all.&quot; He wrote that contact with Balakirev in September 1865 encouraged him &quot;to get accustomed to music and later to plunge into it&quot;. At Balakirev&#x27;s suggestion, he wrote a trio to the scherzo of the E-flat minor symphony, which it had lacked up to that point, and reorchestrated the entire symphony. Its first performance came in December of that year under Balakirev&#x27;s direction in Saint Petersburg. A second performance followed in March 1866 under the direction of Konstantin Lyadov (father of composer Anatoly Lyadov).

Correspondence between Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev clearly shows that some ideas for the symphony originated with Balakirev, who seldom stopped at merely correcting a piece of music, and would often recompose it at the piano. Rimsky-Korsakov recalled,
A pupil like myself had to submit to Balakirev a proposed composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try hard to make the author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over a long period of time under the cold control of self-criticism.

Rimsky-Korsakov recalled that &quot;Balakirev had no difficulty in getting along with me. At his suggestion I most readily rewrote the symphonic movements composed by me and brought them to completion with the help of his advice and improvisations&quot;. Though Rimsky-Korsakov later found Balakirev&#x27;s influence stifling, and broke free from it, this did not stop him in his memoirs from extolling the older composer&#x27;s talents as a critic and improviser. Under Balakirev&#x27;s mentoring, Rimsky-Korsakov turned to other compositions. He began a symphony in B minor, but felt it too closely followed Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony and abandoned it. He completed an Overture on Three Russian Themes, based on Balakirev&#x27;s folksong overtures, as well as a Fantasia on Serbian Themes that was performed at a concert given for the delegates of the Slavonic Congress in 1867. In his review of this concert, nationalist critic Vladimir Stasov coined the phrase &quot;Moguchaya kuchka&quot; for the Balakirev circle (&quot;Moguchaya kuchka&quot; is usually translated as &quot;The Mighty Handful&quot; or &quot;The Five&quot;). Rimsky-Korsakov also composed the initial versions of &quot;Sadko&quot; and &quot;Antar&quot;, which cemented his reputation as a writer of orchestral works.

Rimsky-Korsakov socialized and discussed music with the other members of The Five; they critiqued one another&#x27;s works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with Alexander Borodin, whose music &quot;astonished&quot; him. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers&#x27; works, with preferred tastes running &quot;toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven&#x27;s late quartets&quot;. Mendelssohn was not thought of highly, Mozart and Haydn &quot;were considered out of date and naïve&quot;, and J.S. Bach merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz &quot;was highly esteemed&quot;, Liszt &quot;crippled and perverted from a musical point of view ... even a caricature&quot;, and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov &quot;listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination&quot;. Often, the musical works in question &quot;were played before me only in fragments, and I had no idea of the whole work&quot;. This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them &quot;as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth&quot;.

Rimsky-Korsakov became especially appreciated within The Five, and among those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera &quot;William Ratcliff&quot; and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera &quot;The Stone Guest&quot;.

In late 1871, Rimsky-Korsakov moved into Voin&#x27;s former apartment, and invited Mussorgsky to be his roommate. The working arrangement they agreed upon was that Mussorgsky used the piano in the mornings while Rimsky-Korsakov worked on copying or orchestration. When Mussorgsky left for his civil service job at noon, Rimsky-Korsakov then used the piano. Time in the evenings was allotted by mutual agreement. &quot;That autumn and winter the two of us accomplished a good deal&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, &quot;with constant exchange of ideas and plans. Mussorgsky composed and orchestrated the Polish act of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and the folk scene &#x27;Near Kromy.&#x27; I orchestrated and finished my &quot;Maid of Pskov&quot;.&quot;

===Professorship, marriage, inspector of bands===
In 1871, the 27-year-old Rimsky-Korsakov became Professor of Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration) at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, as well as leader of the Orchestra Class. He retained his position in active naval service, and taught his classes in uniform (military officers in Russia were required to wear their uniforms every day, as they were considered to be always on duty).

Rimsky-Korsakov explained in his memoirs that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year as director of the Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s services. Biographer Mikhail Tsetlin (aka Mikhail Zetlin) suggests that Azanchevsky&#x27;s motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which he would write in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.

Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s reputation at this time was as a master of orchestration, based on &quot;Sadko&quot; and &quot;Antar&quot;. He had written these works mainly by intuition. His knowledge of musical theory was elemental; he had never written any counterpoint, could not harmonize a simple chorale, nor knew the names or intervals of musical chords. He had never conducted an orchestra, and had been discouraged from doing so by the navy, which did not approve of his appearing on the podium in uniform. Aware of his technical shortcomings, Rimsky-Korsakov consulted Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, with whom he and the others in The Five had been in occasional contact. Tchaikovsky, unlike The Five, had received academic training in composition at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, and was serving as Professor of Music Theory at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky advised him to study.

Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that while teaching at the Conservatory he soon became &quot;possibly its very best &quot;pupil&quot; [Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s emphasis], judging by the quantity and value of the information it gave me!&quot; To prepare himself, and to stay at least one step ahead of his students, he took a three-year sabbatical from composing original works, and assiduously studied at home while he lectured at the Conservatory. He taught himself from textbooks, and followed a strict regimen of composing contrapuntal exercises, fugues, chorales and &quot;a cappella&quot; choruses.

Rimsky-Korsakov eventually became an excellent teacher and a fervent believer in academic training. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as &quot;Sadko&quot; and &quot;Antar&quot;, in a search for perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he mastered the art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his hands-on experience with the orchestra.
Professorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov financial security, which encouraged him to settle down and to start a family. In December 1871 he proposed to Nadezhda Purgold, with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household. They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children. Their first son, Mikhail, became an entomologist while another son, Andrei, became a musicologist, married the composer Yuliya Veysberg and wrote a multi-volume study of his father&#x27;s life and work.

Nadezhda became a musical as well as domestic partner with her husband, much as Clara Schumann had been with her own husband Robert. She was beautiful, capable, strong-willed, and far better trained musically than her husband at the time they married—she had attended the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in the mid-1860s, studying piano with Anton Gerke (one of whose private students was Mussorgsky) and music theory with Nikolai Zaremba, who also taught Tchaikovsky. Nadezhda proved a fine and most demanding critic of her husband&#x27;s work; her influence over him in musical matters was strong enough for Balakirev and Stasov to wonder whether she was leading him astray from their musical preferences. Musicologist Lyle Neff wrote that while Nadezhda gave up her own compositional career when she married Rimsky-Korsakov, she &quot;had a considerable influence on the creation of [Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s] first three operas. She travelled with her husband, attended rehearsals and arranged compositions by him and others&quot; for piano four hands, which she played with her husband. &quot;Her last years were dedicated to issuing her husband&#x27;s posthumous literary and musical legacy, maintaining standards for performance of his works ... and preparing material for a museum in his name.&quot;
In early 1873, the navy created the civilian post of Inspector of Naval Bands, with a rank of Collegiate Assessor, and appointed Rimsky-Korsakov. This kept him on the navy payroll and listed on the roster of the Chancellery of the Navy Department but allowed him to resign his commission. The composer commented, &quot;I parted with delight with both my military status and my officer&#x27;s uniform&quot;, he later wrote. &quot;Henceforth I was a musician officially and incontestably.&quot; As Inspector, Rimsky-Korsakov applied himself with zeal to his duties. He visited naval bands throughout Russia, supervised the bandmasters and their appointments, reviewed the bands&#x27; repertoire, and inspected the quality of their instruments. He wrote a study program for a complement of music students who held navy fellowships at the Conservatory, and acted as an intermediary between the Conservatory and the navy. He also indulged in a long-standing desire to familiarize himself with the construction and playing technique of orchestral instruments. These studies prompted him to write a textbook on orchestration. He used the privileges of rank to exercise and expand upon his knowledge. He discussed arrangements of musical works for military band with bandmasters, encouraged and reviewed their efforts, held concerts at which he could hear these pieces, and orchestrated original works, and works by other composers, for military bands.

In March 1884, an Imperial Order abolished the navy office of Inspector of Bands, and Rimsky-Korsakov was relieved of his duties. He worked under Balakirev in the Court Chapel as a deputy until 1894, which allowed him to study Russian Orthodox church music. He also taught classes at the chapel, and wrote his textbook on harmony for use there and at the Conservatory.

===Backlash and &quot;May Night&quot;===
Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s studies and his change in attitude regarding music education brought him the scorn of his fellow nationalists, who thought he was throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. After he strove &quot;to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible&quot; into his Third Symphony, he wrote chamber works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F major (Op. 12) and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano in B-flat. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that they &quot;were filled with a host of clever things but ... [were] imbued with a dryly pedantic character&quot;. Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept &quot;feeling that this is the work of a German &quot;Herr Professor&quot; who has put on his glasses and is about to write &quot;Eine grosse Symphonie in C&quot;&quot;.

According to Rimsky-Korsakov, the other members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the orchestra in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that &quot;they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path&quot;. Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by Anton Rubinstein, a composer opposed to the nationalists&#x27; music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov &quot;might amount to something&quot; as a composer. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, &quot;Apparently [Rimsky-Korsakov] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end will be difficult to predict. Either a great master will come out of him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks&quot;.

Two projects helped Rimsky-Korsakov focus on less academic music-making. The first was the creation of two folk song collections in 1874. Rimsky-Korsakov transcribed 40 Russian songs for voice and piano from performances by folk singer Tvorty Filippov, who approached him at Balakirev&#x27;s suggestion. This collection was followed by a second containing 100 songs, supplied by friends and servants, or taken from rare and out-of-print collections. Rimsky-Korsakov later credited this work as a great influence on him as a composer; it also supplied a vast amount of musical material from which he could draw for future projects, either by direct quotation or as models for composing fakeloric passages. The second project was the editing of orchestral scores by pioneer Russian composer Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857) in collaboration with Balakirev and Anatoly Lyadov. Glinka&#x27;s sister, Lyudmila Ivanovna Shestakova, wanted to preserve her brother&#x27;s musical legacy in print, and paid the costs of the project from her own pocket. No similar project had been attempted before in Russian music, and guidelines for scholarly musical editing had to be established and agreed. While Balakirev favored making changes in Glinka&#x27;s music to &quot;correct&quot; what he saw as compositional flaws, Rimsky-Korsakov favored a less intrusive approach. Eventually, Rimsky-Korsakov prevailed. &quot;Work on Glinka&#x27;s scores was an unexpected schooling for me&quot;, he later wrote. &quot;Even before this I had known and worshipped his operas; but as editor of the scores in print I had to go through Glinka&#x27;s style and instrumentation to their last little note ... And this was a beneficent discipline for me, leading me as it did to the path of modern music, after my vicissitudes with counterpoint and strict style&quot;.

In mid-1877, Rimsky-Korsakov thought increasingly about the short story &quot;May Night&quot; by Nikolai Gogol. The story had long been a favorite of his, and his wife Nadezhda had encouraged him to write an opera based on it from the day of their betrothal, when they had read it together. While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.

Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that &quot;May Night&quot; was of great importance because, despite the opera&#x27;s containing a good deal of contrapuntal music, he nevertheless &quot;&quot;cast off the shackles of counterpoint&quot; [emphasis Rimsky-Korsakov]&quot;. He wrote the opera in a folk-like melodic idiom, and scored it in a transparent manner much in the style of Glinka. Nevertheless, despite the ease of writing this opera and the next, &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;, from time to time he suffered from creative paralysis between 1881 and 1888. He kept busy during this time by editing Mussorgsky&#x27;s works and completing Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot; (Mussorgsky died in 1881, Borodin in 1887).

===Belyayev circle===
Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that he became acquainted with budding music patron Mitrofan Belyayev (M. P. Belaieff) in Moscow in 1882. Belyayev was one of a growing coterie of Russian nouveau-riche industrialists who became patrons of the arts in mid- to late-19th century Russia; their number included railway magnate Savva Mamontov and textile manufacturer Pavel Tretyakov. Belyayev, Mamontov and Tretyakov &quot;wanted to contribute conspicuously to public life&quot;. They had worked their way into wealth, and being Slavophiles in their national outlook believed in the greater glory of Russia. Owing to this belief, they were more likely than the aristocracy to support native talent, and were more inclined to support nationalist artists over cosmopolitan ones. This preference paralleled a general upsurge in nationalism and Russophilia that became prevalent in mainstream Russian art and society.

By 1883 Rimsky-Korsakov had become a regular visitor to the weekly &quot;quartet Fridays&quot; (&quot;Les Vendredis&quot;) held at Belyayev&#x27;s home in Saint Petersburg. Belyayev, who had already taken a keen interest in the musical future of the teenage Alexander Glazunov, rented a hall and hired an orchestra in 1884 to play Glazunov&#x27;s First Symphony plus an orchestral suite Glazunov had just composed. This concert and a rehearsal the previous year gave Rimsky-Korsakov the idea of offering concerts featuring Russian compositions, a prospect to which Belyayev was amenable. The Russian Symphony Concerts were inaugurated during the 1886–87 season, with Rimsky-Korsakov sharing conducting duties with Anatoly Lyadov. He finished his revision of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; and conducted it at the opening concert. The concerts also coaxed him out of his creative drought; he wrote &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot; and the &quot;Russian Easter Overture&quot; specifically for them. He noted that these three works &quot;show a considerable falling off in the use of contrapuntal devices ... [replaced] by a strong and virtuoso development of every kind of figuration which sustains the technical interest of my compositions&quot;.

Rimsky-Korsakov was asked for advice and guidance not just on the Russian Symphony Concerts, but on other projects through which Belyayev aided Russian composers. &quot;By force of matters purely musical I turned out to be the head of the Belyayev circle&quot;, he wrote. &quot;As the head Belyayev, too, considered me, consulting me about everything and referring everyone to me as chief&quot;. In 1884 Belyayev set up an annual Glinka prize, and in 1885 he founded his own music publishing firm, through which he published works by Borodin, Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov at his own expense. To select which composers to assist with money, publication or performances from the many who now appealed for help, Belyayev set up an advisory council made up of Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov. They would look through the compositions and appeals submitted and suggest which composers were deserving of patronage and public attention.

The group of composers who now congregated with Glazunov, Lyadov and Rimsky-Korsakov became known as the Belyayev circle, named after their financial benefactor. These composers were nationalistic in their musical outlook, as The Five before them had been. Like The Five, they believed in a uniquely Russian style of classical music that utilized folk music and exotic melodic, harmonic and rhythmic elements, as exemplified by the music of Balakirev, Borodin and Rimsky-Korsakov. Unlike The Five, these composers also believed in the necessity of an academic, Western-based background in composition—which Rimsky-Korsakov had instilled in his years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Compared to the &quot;revolutionary&quot; composers in Balakirev&#x27;s circle, Rimsky-Korsakov found those in the Belyayev circle to be &quot;progressive ... attaching as it did great importance to technical perfection, but ... also broke new paths, though more securely, even if less speedily ...&quot;

===Increased contact with Tchaikovsky===
In November 1887, Tchaikovsky arrived in Saint Petersburg in time to hear several of the Russian Symphony Concerts. One of them included the first complete performance of his First Symphony, subtitled &quot;Winter Daydreams&quot;, in its final version. Another concert featured the premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s Third Symphony in its revised version. Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky corresponded considerably before the visit and spent a lot of time together, along with Glazunov and Lyadov. Though Tchaikovsky had been a regular visitor to the Rimsky-Korsakov home since 1876, and had at one point offered to arrange Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s appointment as director of the Moscow Conservatory, this was the beginning of closer relations between the two. Within a couple of years, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s visits became more frequent.

During these visits and especially in public, Rimsky-Korsakov wore a mask of geniality. Privately, he found the situation emotionally complex, and confessed his fears to his friend, the Moscow critic Semyon Kruglikov. Memories persisted of the tension between Tchaikovsky and The Five over the differences in their musical philosophies—tension acute enough for Tchaikovsky&#x27;s brother Modest to liken their relations at that time to &quot;those between two friendly neighboring states ... cautiously prepared to meet on common ground, but jealously guarding their separate interests&quot;. Rimsky-Korsakov observed, not without annoyance, how Tchaikovsky became increasingly popular among Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s followers. This personal jealousy was compounded by a professional one, as Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music became increasingly popular among the composers of the Belyayev circle, and remained on the whole more famous than his own. Even so, when Tchaikovsky attended Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s nameday party in May 1893, Rimsky-Korsakov asked Tchaikovsky personally if he would conduct four concerts of the Russian Musical Society in Saint Petersburg the following season. After hesitation, Tchaikovsky agreed. While his sudden death in late 1893 prevented him from fulfilling this commitment in its entirety, the list of works he had planned to conduct included Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s Third Symphony.

===Increasing conservatism; second creative drought===

In March 1889, Angelo Neumann&#x27;s traveling &quot;Richard Wagner Theater&quot; visited Saint Petersburg, giving four cycles of &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; there under the direction of Karl Muck. The Five had ignored Wagner&#x27;s music, but &quot;The Ring&quot; impressed Rimsky-Korsakov: he was astonished with Wagner&#x27;s mastery of orchestration. He attended the rehearsals with Glazunov, and followed the score. After hearing these performances, Rimsky-Korsakov devoted himself almost exclusively to composing operas for the rest of his creative life. Wagner&#x27;s use of the orchestra influenced Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s orchestration, beginning with the arrangement of the polonaise from Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; that he made for concert use in 1889.

Toward music more adventurous than Wagner&#x27;s, especially that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards when he heard pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Estampes&quot; and write in his diary about them, &quot;Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination.&quot; This was part of an increasing musical conservatism on his part (his &quot;musical conscience&quot;, as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, &quot;It&#x27;s incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time.&quot; By 1901 he would write of growing &quot;indignant at all [of Wagner&#x27;s] blunders of the ear&quot;—this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.

In 1892, Rimsky-Korsakov suffered a second creative drought, brought on by bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household may have been a factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau &quot;Sadko&quot; and the opera &quot;The Maid of Pskov&quot;, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before &quot;May Night&quot; in their original form.

Another death brought about a creative renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s short story &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera &quot;Vakula the Smith&quot;. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908 — a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it in the last four years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.

===1905 Revolution===
In 1905, demonstrations took place in the St. Petersburg Conservatory as part of the 1905 Revolution; these, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote, were triggered by similar disturbances at St. Petersburg State University, in which students demanded political reforms and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in Russia. &quot;I was chosen a member of the committee for adjusting differences with agitated pupils&quot;, he recalled; almost as soon as the committee had been formed, &quot;[a]ll sorts of measures were recommended to expel the ringleaders, to quarter the police in the Conservatory, to close the Conservatory entirely&quot;.
A lifelong liberal politically, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that he felt someone had to protect the rights of the students to demonstrate, especially as disputes and wrangling between students and authorities were becoming increasingly violent. In an open letter, he sided with the students against what he saw as unwarranted interference by Conservatory leadership and the Russian Musical Society. A second letter, this time signed by a number of faculty including Rimsky-Korsakov, demanded the resignation of the head of the Conservatory. Partly as a result of these two letters he wrote, approximately 100 Conservatory students were expelled and he was removed from his professorship.

Just before the dismissal was enacted, Rimsky-Korsakov received a letter from one of the members of the school directorate, suggesting that he take up the directorship in the interest of calming student unrest. &quot;Probably the member of the Directorate held a minority opinion, but signed the resolution nevertheless,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I sent a negative reply.&quot; Partly in defiance of his dismissal, Rimsky-Korsakov continued teaching his students from his home.

Not long after Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s dismissal, a student production of his opera &quot;Kashchey the Immortal&quot; was followed not with the scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, which led to a police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s work. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events, an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer&#x27;s residence with letters of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov. Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.
In April 1907, Rimsky-Korsakov conducted a pair of concerts in Paris, hosted by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, which featured music of the Russian nationalist school. The concerts were hugely successful in popularizing Russian classical music of this kind in Europe, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s in particular. The following year, his opera &quot;Sadko&quot; was produced at the Paris Opéra and &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; at the Opéra-Comique. He also had the opportunity to hear more recent music by European composers. He hissed unabashedly when he heard Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera &quot;Salome&quot;, and told Diaghilev after hearing Claude Debussy&#x27;s opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t make me listen to all these horrors or I shall end up liking them!&quot; Hearing these works led him to appreciate his place in the world of classical music. He admitted that he was a &quot;convinced kuchkist&quot; (after &quot;kuchka&quot;, the shortened Russian term for The Five) and that his works belonged to an era that musical trends had left behind.

===Death===
Beginning around 1890, Rimsky-Korsakov suffered from angina. While this ailment initially wore him down gradually, the stresses concurrent with the 1905 Revolution and its aftermath greatly accelerated its progress. After December 1907, his illness became severe, and he could not work.

In 1908, he died at his Lubensk estate near Luga (modern day Plyussky District of Pskov Oblast), and was interred in Tikhvin Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery in Saint Petersburg, next to Borodin, Glinka, Mussorgsky and Stasov.

==Compositions==

Rimsky-Korsakov followed the musical ideals espoused by The Five. He employed Orthodox liturgical themes in the &quot;Russian Easter Festival Overture&quot;, folk song in &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot; and orientalism in &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, possibly his best known work. He proved a prolific composer but also a perpetually self-critical one. He revised every orchestral work up to and including his Third Symphony—some, like &quot;Antar&quot; and &quot;Sadko&quot;, more than once. These revisions range from minor changes of tempo, phrasing and instrumental detail to wholesale transposition and complete recomposition.

Rimsky-Korsakov was open about the influences in his music, telling Vasily Yastrebtsev, &quot;Study Liszt and Balakirev more closely, and you&#x27;ll see that a great deal in me is not mine&quot;. He followed Balakirev in his use of the whole tone scale, treatment of folk songs and musical orientalism and Liszt for harmonic adventurousness. (The violin melody used to portray Scheherazade is very closely related to its counterpart in Balakirev&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Tamara&quot;, while the &quot;Russian Easter Overtures&quot; follows the design and plan of Balakirev&#x27;s Second Overture on Russian Themes.)

Nevertheless, while he took Glinka and Liszt as his harmonic models, his use of whole tone and octatonic scales do demonstrate his originality. He developed both these compositional devices for the &quot;fantastic&quot; sections of his operas, which depicted magical or supernatural characters and events.

Rimsky-Korsakov maintained an interest in harmonic experiments and continued exploring new idioms throughout his career. He tempered this interest with an abhorrence of excess and kept his tendency to experiment under constant control. The more radical his harmonies became, the more he attempted to control them with strict rules—applying his &quot;musical conscience&quot;, as he called it. In this sense, he was both a progressive and a conservative composer. The whole tone and octatonic scales were both considered adventurous in the Western classical tradition, and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s use of them made his harmonies seem radical. Conversely, his care about how or when in a composition he used these scales made him seem conservative compared with later composers like Igor Stravinsky, though they were often building on Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s work.

===Operas===

While Rimsky-Korsakov is best known in the West for his orchestral works, his operas are more complex, offering a wider variety of orchestral effects than in his instrumental works and fine vocal writing. Excerpts and suites from them have proved as popular in the West as the purely orchestral works. The best-known of these excerpts is probably &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; from &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan,&quot; which has often been heard by itself in orchestral programs, and in countless arrangements and transcriptions, most famously in a piano version made by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. Other selections familiar to listeners in the West are &quot;Dance of the Tumblers&quot; from &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;, &quot;Procession of the Nobles&quot; from &quot;Mlada&quot;, and &quot;Song of the Indian Guest&quot; (or, less accurately, &quot;Song of India&quot;) from &quot;Sadko&quot;, as well as suites from &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; and &quot;The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya&quot;.

The Operas fall into three categories:
* Historical drama: &quot;The Maid of Pskov&quot;, and its prologue &quot;The Noblewoman Vera Sheloga&quot;, &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;, &quot;The Tsar&#x27;s Bride&quot;, &quot;Pan Voyevoda&quot;, &quot;Servilya&quot;
* Folk operas: &quot;May Night&quot;, &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;
* Fairy tales and legends: &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;, &quot;Mlada&quot;, &quot;Sadko&quot;, &quot;Kashchey the Deathless&quot;, &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;, &quot;The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya&quot;, and &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot;.

Of this range, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in 1902, &quot;In every new work of mine I am trying to do something that is new for me. On the one hand, I am pushed on by the thought that in this way, [my music] will retain freshness and interest, but at the same time I am prompted by my pride to think that many facets, devices, moods and styles, if not all, should be within my reach.&quot; Among his operatic works, Rimsky-Korsakov’s &quot;Snegurochka&quot;, also known as &quot;The Snow-Maiden&quot;, sums up his compositional character. The Snow-maiden is a character who is the personification of love and passion, and yet she melts in the first rays of the sun. Rimsky-Korsakov’s works mirror the snow-maiden, as they are exquisite, but can quickly turn cold and pellucid and “dissolve at the touch of the living language of passion”.

American music critic and journalist Harold C. Schonberg wrote that the operas &quot;open up a delightful new world, the world of the Russian East, the world of supernaturalism and the exotic, the world of Slavic pantheism and vanished races. Genuine poetry suffuses them, and they are scored with brilliance and resource.&quot; According to some critics Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s music in these works lacks dramatic power, a seemingly fatal flaw in an operatic composer. This may have been conscious, as he repeatedly stated in his writing that he felt operas were first and foremost musical works rather than mainly dramatic ones. Ironically, the operas succeed dramatically in most cases by being deliberately non-theatrical.

===Orchestral works===
The purely orchestral works fall into two categories. The best-known ones in the West, and perhaps the finest in overall quality, are mainly programmatic in nature — in other words, the musical content and how it is handled in the piece is determined by the plot or characters in a story, the action in a painting or events reported through another non-musical source. The second category of works is more academic, such as his First and Third Symphonies and his Sinfonietta. In these, Rimsky-Korsakov still employed folk themes but subjected them to abstract rules of musical composition.

Program music came naturally to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, &quot;even a folk theme has a program of sorts.&quot; He composed the majority of his orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career—at the beginning, with &quot;Sadko&quot; and &quot;Antar&quot; (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot; and the &quot;Russian Easter Overture&quot;. Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer&#x27;s overall approach and the way he used his musical themes remained consistent. Both &quot;Antar&quot; and &quot;Scheherazade&quot; use a robust &quot;Russian&quot; theme to portray the male protagonists (the title character in &quot;Antar&quot;; the sultan in &quot;Scheherazade&quot;) and a more sinuous &quot;Eastern&quot; theme for the female ones (the peri Gul-Nazar in &quot;Antar&quot; and the title character in &quot;Scheherazade&quot;).

Where Rimsky-Korsakov changed between these two sets of works was in orchestration. While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of instrumental forces, the sparser textures of &quot;Sadko&quot; and &quot;Antar&quot; pale compared to the luxuriance of the more popular works of the 1880s. While a principle of highlighting &quot;primary hues&quot; of instrumental color remained in place, it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects, some gleaned from other composers including Wagner, but many invented by himself.

As a result, these works resemble brightly colored mosaics, striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups. The final &quot;tutti&quot; of &quot;Scheherazade&quot; is a prime example of this scoring. The theme is assigned to trombones playing in unison, and is accompanied by a combination of string patterns. Meanwhile, another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the woodwinds and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion.

Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s non-program music, though well-crafted, does not rise to the same level of inspiration as his programmatic works; he needed fantasy to bring out the best in him. The First Symphony follows the outlines of Schumann&#x27;s Fourth extremely closely, and is slighter in its thematic material than his later compositions. The Third Symphony and Sinfonietta each contain a series of variations on less-than-the-best music that can lead to tedium.

===Smaller-scale works===
Rimsky-Korsakov composed dozens of art songs, arrangements of folk songs, chamber and piano music. While the piano music is relatively unimportant, many of the art songs possess a delicate beauty. While they yield in overt lyricism to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, otherwise they reserve their place in the standard repertory of Russian singers.

Rimsky-Korsakov also wrote a body of choral works, both secular and for Russian Orthodox Church service. The latter include settings of portions of the &quot;Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom&quot; (despite his own atheism).

==Legacy==
===Transitional figure===
The critic Vladimir Stasov, who along with Balakirev had founded The Five, wrote in 1882, &quot;Beginning with Glinka, all the best Russian musicians have been very skeptical of book learning and have never approached it with the servility and the superstitious reverence with which it is approached to this day in many parts of Europe.&quot; This statement was not true for Glinka, who studied Western music theory assiduously with Siegfried Dehn in Berlin before he composed his opera &quot;A Life for the Tsar&quot;. It was true for Balakirev, who &quot;opposed academicism with tremendous vigor,&quot; and it was true initially for Rimsky-Korsakov, who had been imbued by Balakirev and Stasov with the same attitude.
One point Stasov omitted purposely, which would have disproved his statement completely, was that at the time he wrote it, Rimsky-Korsakov had been pouring his &quot;book learning&quot; into students at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory for over a decade. Beginning with his three years of self-imposed study, Rimsky-Korsakov had drawn closer to Tchaikovsky and further away from the rest of The Five, while the rest of The Five had drawn back from him and Stasov had branded him a &quot;renegade&quot;. Richard Taruskin wrote, &quot;The older he became, the greater was the irony with which Rimsky-Korsakov looked back on his kuchkist days.&quot; When the young Semyon Kruglikov was considering a future in composition, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote the future critic,

About a talent for composition ... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little ... Yes, one can study on one&#x27;s own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study ... All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and especially Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.

Taruskin points out this statement, which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote while Borodin and Mussorgsky were still alive, as proof of his estrangement from the rest of The Five and an indication of the kind of teacher he eventually became. By the time he instructed Liadov and Glazunov, &quot;their training hardly differed from [Tchaikovsky&#x27;s]. An ideal of the strictest professionalism was instilled in them from the beginning.&quot; By the time Borodin died in 1887, the era of autodidactism for Russian composers had effectively ended. Every Russian who aspired to write classical music attended a conservatory and received the same formal education. &quot;There was no more &#x27;Moscow&#x27;, no &#x27;St. Petersburg&#x27;.&quot; Taruskin writes; &quot;at last all Russia was one. Moreover, by century&#x27;s end, the theory and composition faculties of Rubinstein&#x27;s Conservatory were entirely in the hands of representatives of the New Russian School. Viewed against the background of Stasov&#x27;s predictions, there could scarcely be any greater irony.&quot;

===Students===
Rimsky-Korsakov taught theory and composition to 250 students over his 35-year tenure at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, &quot;enough to people a whole &#x27;school&#x27; of composers&quot;. This does not include pupils at the two other schools where he taught, including Glazunov, or those he taught privately at his home, such as Igor Stravinsky. Apart from Glazunov and Stravinsky, students who later found fame included Anatoly Lyadov, Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, Alexander Spendiaryan, Sergei Prokofiev, Ottorino Respighi, Witold Maliszewski, Mykola Lysenko, Artur Kapp, and Konstanty Gorski. Other students included the music critic and musicologist Alexander Ossovsky, and the composer Lazare Saminsky.

Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented students needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them in understanding the forms of composition; give them a year or two of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, &quot;I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work.&quot; Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. &quot;Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that all we had to do was to do our work well.&quot;

===Editing the work of The Five===
Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s editing of works by The Five is significant. It was a practical extension of the collaborative atmosphere of The Five during the 1860s and 1870s, when they heard each other&#x27;s compositions in progress and worked on them together, and was an effort to save works that would otherwise either have languished unheard or become lost entirely. This work included the completion of Alexander Borodin&#x27;s opera &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, which Rimsky-Korsakov undertook with the help of Glazunov after Borodin&#x27;s death, and the orchestration of passages from César Cui&#x27;s &quot;William Ratcliff&quot; for its first production in 1869. He also completely orchestrated the opera &quot;The Stone Guest by &quot;Alexander Dargomyzhsky three times—in 1869–70, 1892 and 1902. While not a member of The Five himself, Dargomyzhsky was closely associated with the group and shared their musical philosophy.

Musicologist Francis Maes wrote that while Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s efforts are laudable, they are also controversial. It was generally assumed that with &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov edited and orchestrated the existing fragments of the opera while Glazunov composed and added missing parts, including most of the third act and the overture. This was exactly what Rimsky-Korsakov stated in his memoirs. Both Maes and Richard Taruskin cite an analysis of Borodin&#x27;s manuscripts by musicologist Pavel Lamm, which showed that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov discarded nearly 20 percent of Borodin&#x27;s score. According to Maes, the result is more a collaborative effort by all three composers than a true representation of Borodin&#x27;s intent. Lamm stated that because of the extremely chaotic state of Borodin&#x27;s manuscripts, a modern alternative to Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov&#x27;s edition would be extremely difficult to complete.

More debatable, according to Maes, is Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s editing of Mussorgsky&#x27;s works. After Mussorgsky&#x27;s death in 1881, Rimsky-Korsakov revised and completed several of Mussorgsky&#x27;s works for publication and performance, helping to spread Mussorgsky&#x27;s works throughout Russia and to the West. Maes, in reviewing Mussorgsky&#x27;s scores, wrote that Rimsky-Korsakov allowed his &quot;musical conscience&quot; to dictate his editing, and he changed or removed what he considered musical over-experimentation or poor form. Because of this, Rimsky-Korsakov has been accused of pedantry in &quot;correcting&quot;, among other things, matters of harmony. Rimsky-Korsakov may have foreseen questions over his efforts when he wrote,

If Mussorgsky&#x27;s compositions are destined to live unfaded for fifty years after their author&#x27;s death (when all his works will become the property of any and every publisher), such an archeologically accurate edition will always be possible, as the manuscripts went to the Public Library on leaving me. For the present, though, there was need of an edition for performances, for practical artistic purposes, for making his colossal talent known, and not for the mere studying of his personality and artistic sins.

Maes stated that time proved Rimsky-Korsakov correct when it came to posterity&#x27;s re-evaluation of Mussorgsky&#x27;s work. Mussorgsky&#x27;s musical style, once considered unpolished, is now admired for its originality. While Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; is still the version generally performed, Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s other revisions, like his version of &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, have been replaced by Mussorgsky&#x27;s original.

==Folklore and pantheism==
Rimsky-Korsakov may have saved the most personal side of his creativity for his approach to Russian folklore. Folklorism as practiced by Balakirev and the other members of The Five had been based largely on the &quot;protyazhnaya&quot; dance song. &quot;Protyazhnaya&quot; literally meant &quot;drawn-out song&quot;, or melismatically elaborated lyric song. The characteristics of this song exhibit extreme rhythmic flexibility, an asymmetrical phrase structure and tonal ambiguity. After composing &quot;May Night&quot;, Rimsky-Korsakov was increasingly drawn to &quot;calendar songs&quot;, which were written for specific ritual occasions. The ties to folk culture was what interested him most in folk music, even in his days with The Five; these songs formed a part of rural customs, echoed old Slavic paganism and the pantheistic world of folk rites. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that his interest in these songs was heightened by his study of them while compiling his folk song collections. He wrote that he &quot;was captivated by the poetic side of the cult of sun-worship, and sought its survivals and echoes in both the tunes and the words of the songs. The pictures of the ancient pagan period and spirit loomed before me, as it then seemed, with great clarity, luring me on with the charm of antiquity. These occupations subsequently had a great influence in the direction of my own activity as a composer&quot;.

Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s interest in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author&#x27;s standard work, &quot;The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs&quot;, became Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev&#x27;s ideas in &quot;May Night&quot;, in which he helped fill out Gogol&#x27;s story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He went further down this path in &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot;, where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and &quot;khorovodi&quot; (ceremonial dances) in the folk tradition.

Musicologists and Slavicists have long recognized that Rimsky-Korsakov was an ecumenical artist whose folklore-inspired operas take up such issues as the relationship between paganism and Christianity and the seventeenth-century schism in the Orthodox Church.

==In film==
* The Soviet 1953 film &quot;Rimsky-Korsakov&quot; presents the last twenty years of his life. He is played by Grigori Belov. His earlier years with &quot;The Five&quot; were portrayed by Andrei Popov in the 1950 film from the same studio titled &quot;Mussorgsky&quot;.

==Publications==
Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s autobiography and his books on harmony and orchestration have been translated into English and published. Two books he started in 1892 but left unfinished were a comprehensive text on Russian music and a manuscript, now lost, on an unknown subject.

<text>The Five (), also known as the Mighty Handful or The Mighty Five, were five prominent 19th-century Russian composers who worked together to create a distinct national style of classical music: Mily Balakirev (the leader), César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin. They lived in Saint Petersburg and collaborated from 1856 to 1870.

==History==
===Name===

In May 1867 the critic Vladimir Stasov wrote an article, titled &quot;Mr. Balakirev&#x27;s Slavic Concert&quot;, covering a concert that had been performed for visiting Slav delegations at the &quot;All-Russian Ethnographical Exhibition&quot; in Moscow. The four Russian composers whose works were played at the concert were Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Dargomyzhsky, Mily Balakirev, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The article ended with the following statement:

The expression &quot;mighty handful&quot; (, &quot;Moguchaya kuchka&quot;, &quot;Mighty Bunch&quot;) was mocked by enemies of Balakirev and Stasov: Aleksandr Serov, academic circles of the conservatory, the Russian Musical Society, and their press supporters. The group ignored critics and continued operating under the moniker. This loose collection of composers gathered around Balakirev now included Cui, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Borodin — the five who have come to be associated with the name &quot;Mighty Handful&quot;, or sometimes &quot;The Five&quot;. Gerald Abraham stated flatly in the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; that &quot;they never called themselves, nor were they ever called in Russia, &#x27;The Five&#x27;&quot; (although today the Russian equivalent &quot;Пятёрка&quot; (&quot;Pyatyorka&quot;) is occasionally used to refer to this group). In his memoirs, Rimsky-Korsakov routinely refers to the group as &quot;Balakirev&#x27;s circle&quot;, and occasionally uses &quot;The Mighty Handful&quot;, usually with an ironic tone. He also makes the following reference to &quot;The Five&quot;:

The Russian word &quot;kuchka&quot; also spawned the terms &quot;kuchkism&quot; and &quot;kuchkist&quot;, which may be applied to artistic aims or works in tune with the sensibilities of the Mighty Handful.

===Formation===
The formation of the group began in 1856 with the first meeting of Balakirev and César Cui. Modest Mussorgsky joined them in 1857, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1861, and Alexander Borodin in 1862. All the composers in The Five were young men in 1862. Balakirev was 25, Cui 27, Mussorgsky 23, Borodin the eldest at 28, and Rimsky-Korsakov just 18. They were all self-trained amateurs. Borodin combined composing with a career in chemistry. Cui was an army engineer who, starting in 1857 and throughout 1860s, taught fortification at military academies. Rimsky-Korsakov was a naval officer (he wrote his First Symphony on a three-year naval voyage circumnavigating the globe). Mussorgsky had been in the prestigious Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Imperial Guard, and then in the civil service before taking up music; even at the height of his career in the 1870s he was forced by the expense of his drinking habit to hold down a full-time job in the State Forestry Department.

In contrast to the élite status and court connections of Conservatory composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, The Five were mainly from the minor gentry of the provinces. To some degree their &quot;esprit de corps&quot; depended on the myth, which they themselves created, of a movement that was more &quot;authentically Russian,&quot; in the sense that it was closer to the native soil, than the classic academy. Spurred on by Russian nationalist ideas, the Five “sought to capture elements of rural Russian life, to build national pride, and to prevent western ideals from seeping into their culture.”

Before them, Mikhail Glinka and Alexander Dargomyzhsky had gone some way towards producing a distinctly Russian kind of music, writing operas on Russian subjects, but the Mighty Handful represented the first concentrated attempt to develop such a music, with Stasov as their artistic adviser and Dargomyzhsky as an elder statesman to the group, so to speak. The circle began to fall apart during the 1870s, no doubt partially due to the fact that Balakirev withdrew from musical life early in the decade for a period of time. All of &quot;The Five&quot; are buried in Tikhvin Cemetery in Saint Petersburg.

==Musical language==
===Stylization===

The musical language The Five developed set them far apart from the Conservatoire. This self-conscious Russian styling was based on two elements:

*They tried to incorporate in their music what they heard in village songs, in Cossack and Caucasian dances, in church chants and the tolling of church bells (to the point where the bell tolling became a cliché). The Five&#x27;s music became filled with imitative sounds of Russian life. They also tried to reproduce the long-drawn, lyrical and melismatic peasant song, what Glinka had once called &quot;the soul of Russian music.&quot; Balakirev made this possible by his study of songs from the Volga in the 1860s. More than any previous anthology, his transcriptions artfully preserved the distinctive aspects of Russian folk music:
**Tonal mutability
*:A tune seems to shift naturally from one tonal center to another, often ending up in a different key than the one in which the song began. This can produce a feeling of elusiveness, a lack of definition or of logical progression in the harmony. Even when stylized by The Five, this quality can make Russian music sound very different from the tonal structures of the West.
**Heterophony
*:A melody is simultaneously rendered by two or more performers in different variations. This is improvised by the singers until the end, when the song reverts to a single melodic line.
**Parallel fifths, fourths, and thirds
*:The effect lends Russian music a raw sonority missing entirely from the comparatively polished harmonies of Western music.
*The Five also adopted a series of harmonic devices to create a distinct &quot;Russian&quot; style and color different from Western music. This &quot;exotic&quot; styling of &quot;Russia&quot; was not just self-conscious but entirely invented. None of these devices were actually used in Russian folk or church music:
**Whole tone scale
*:Although Glinka did not invent this scale, his application of it in the opera &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot; (1842) — most recognizable at the end of the festive overture — provided a characteristic harmonic and melodic device. This scale in &quot;Russian&quot; works often suggests evil or ominous personages or situations. It was used by all the major composers from Tchaikovsky (the appearance of the Countess&#x27;s ghost in &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;) to Rimsky-Korsakov (in all his magic-story operas—&quot;Sadko&quot;, &quot;Kashchey the Deathless&quot; and &quot;The Invisible City of Kitezh&quot;). Claude Debussy also uses this scale in his music, taking this, among many things, from the Russians. Later it became a standard device in horror-movie scores.
**The Russian submediant
*:Also linked to Glinka&#x27;s &quot;Ruslan&quot;, this is a harmonic pattern (in major mode) in which one upper part proceeds from the dominant pitch chromatically to the submediant while the other harmony parts remain constant. The most basic form of this pattern can be shown as follows (beginning with typical tonic): root-position tonic triad → root-position augmented tonic triad → 1st inversion submediant minor triad. A famous example of the Russian submediant occurs in the very opening bars of the third movement of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherezade&quot;.
**Diminished or octatonic scale
*:Rimsky-Korsakov first used this in his symphonic poem &quot;Sadko&quot; in 1867. This scale became a sort of Russian calling-card — a &quot;leitmotif&quot; of magic and menace used not just by Rimsky-Korsakov but all of his followers, above all Alexander Scriabin, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky and Olivier Messiaen (mode 2).
**Modular rotation in sequences of thirds
*:The Five made this device of Franz Liszt their own to base a loose symphonic-poem type of structure. This way, they could avoid the rigid Western laws of modulation in sonata form, allowing the form of a musical composition to be shaped entirely by the &quot;content&quot; of the music (its programmatic statements and visual descriptions) rather than by formal laws of symmetry. This loose structure became especially important for Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, a work that may have done more than any other to define the Russian style.
**Pentatonic scale
*:This stylistic aspect became used by every Russian nationalist composer. Its distinctive feature is to have only five notes in the octave, rather than the seven of the heptatonic scales (e.g., major and minor). The pentatonic scale is one of the ways of suggesting a &quot;primitive&quot; folk-melodic style as well as the &quot;Eastern&quot; element (Middle East, Asia). A melodic example of the &quot;major-mode&quot; pentatonic scale (C-D-E-G-A) can be heard at the entrance of the chorus at the beginning of Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot;.

===Orientalism===
One hallmark of &quot;The Five&quot; was its reliance on orientalism. Many quintessentially &quot;Russian&quot; works were composed in orientalist style, such as Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Islamey&quot;, Borodin&#x27;s &quot;Prince Igor&quot; and Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. Orientalism, in fact, became widely considered in the West both one of the best-known aspects of Russian music and a trait of Russian national character. As leader of &quot;The Five,&quot; Balakirev encouraged the use of eastern themes and harmonies to set their &quot;Russian&quot; music apart from the German symphonism of Anton Rubinstein and other Western-oriented composers. Because Rimsky-Korsakov used Russian folk and oriental melodies in his First Symphony, Stasov and the other nationalists dubbed it the &quot;First Russian Symphony,&quot; even though Rubinstein had written his &quot;Ocean&quot; Symphony a dozen years before it. These were themes Balakirev had transcribed in the Caucasus. &quot;The symphony is good,&quot; Cui wrote to Rimsky-Korsakov in 1863, while the latter was out on naval deployment. &quot;We played it a few days ago at Balakirev&#x27;s—to the great pleasure of Stassov. It is really Russian. Only a Russian could have composed it, because it lacks the slightest trace of any stagnant Germanness.&quot;

Orientalism was not confined to using authentic Eastern melodies. What became more important than the melodies themselves were the musical conventions added to them. These conventions allowed orientalism to become an avenue for writing music on subjects considered unmentionable otherwise, such as political themes and erotic fantasies. It also became a means of expressing Russian supremacy as the empire expanded under Alexander II. This was often reinforced through misogynist symbolism—the rational, active and moral Western man versus the irrational, passive and immoral Eastern woman.

Two major works entirely dominated by orientalism are Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s symphonic suite &quot;Antar&quot; and Balakirev&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Tamara&quot;. &quot;Antar&quot;, set in Arabia, uses two different styles of music, Western (Russian) and Eastern (Arabian). The first theme, Antar&#x27;s, is masculine and Russian in character. The second theme, feminine and oriental in melodic contour, belongs to the queen, Gul Nazar. Rimsky-Korsakov was able to soften the implicit misogyny to some extent. However, female sensuality does exert a paralyzing, ultimately destructive influence. With Gul Nazar extinguishing Antar&#x27;s life in a final embrace, the woman overcomes the man.

Balakirev gives a more overtly misogynistic view of oriental women in &quot;Tamara&quot;. He had originally planned to write a Caucasan dance called a &quot;lezginka&quot;, modeled on Glinka, for this work. However, he discovered a poem by Mikhail Lermontov about the beautiful Tamara, who lived in a tower alongside the gorge of Daryal. She lured travelers and allowed them to enjoy a night of sensual delights, only to kill them and throw their bodies into the River Terek. Balakirev uses two specific codes endemic to orientalism in writing &quot;Tamara&quot;. The first code, based on obsessive rhythms, note repetitions, climactic effects and accelerated tempi, represents Dionysian intoxication. The second code, consisting of unpredictable rhythms, irregular phrasing and based on long passages with many repeat notes, augmented and diminished intervals and extended melismas, depict sensual longing. Not only did Balakirev use these codes extensively, but he also attempted to supercharge them further when he revised the orchestration of &quot;Tamara&quot; in 1898.

Except perhaps for Cui, the members of this group influenced or taught many of the great Russian composers who were to follow, including Alexander Glazunov, Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov, Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, and Dmitri Shostakovich. They also influenced the two French symbolist composers Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy through their radical tonal language.

<doc id="75854" wikidata="Q2681" url="?curid=75854" title="Lempel–Ziv–Welch">
<text>Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) is a universal lossless data compression algorithm created by Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch. It was published by Welch in 1984 as an improved implementation of the LZ78 algorithm published by Lempel and Ziv in 1978. The algorithm is simple to implement and has the potential for very high throughput in hardware implementations. It is the algorithm of the Unix file compression utility compress and is used in the GIF image format.

==Algorithm==
The scenario described by Welch&#x27;s 1984 paper encodes sequences of 8-bit data as fixed-length 12-bit codes. The codes from 0 to 255 represent 1-character sequences consisting of the corresponding 8-bit character, and the codes 256 through 4095 are created in a dictionary for sequences encountered in the data as it is encoded. At each stage in compression, input bytes are gathered into a sequence until the next character would make a sequence with no code yet in the dictionary. The code for the sequence (without that character) is added to the output, and a new code (for the sequence with that character) is added to the dictionary.

The idea was quickly adapted to other situations. In an image based on a color table, for example, the natural character alphabet is the set of color table indexes, and in the 1980s, many images had small color tables (on the order of 16 colors). For such a reduced alphabet, the full 12-bit codes yielded poor compression unless the image was large, so the idea of a variable-width code was introduced: codes typically start one bit wider than the symbols being encoded, and as each code size is used up, the code width increases by 1 bit, up to some prescribed maximum (typically 12 bits). When the maximum code value is reached, encoding proceeds using the existing table, but new codes are not generated for addition to the table.

Further refinements include reserving a code to indicate that the code table should be cleared and restored to its initial state (a &quot;clear code&quot;, typically the first value immediately after the values for the individual alphabet characters), and a code to indicate the end of data (a &quot;stop code&quot;, typically one greater than the clear code). The clear code lets the table be reinitialized after it fills up, which lets the encoding adapt to changing patterns in the input data. Smart encoders can monitor the compression efficiency and clear the table whenever the existing table no longer matches the input well.

Since codes are added in a manner determined by the data, the decoder mimics building the table as it sees the resulting codes. It is critical that the encoder and decoder agree on the variety of LZW used: the size of the alphabet, the maximum table size (and code width), whether variable-width encoding is used, initial code size, and whether to use the clear and stop codes (and what values they have). Most formats that employ LZW build this information into the format specification or provide explicit fields for them in a compression header for the data.

A high-level view of the encoding algorithm is shown here:

# Initialize the dictionary to contain all strings of length one.
# Find the longest string W in the dictionary that matches the current input.
# Emit the dictionary index for W to output and remove W from the input.
# Add W followed by the next symbol in the input to the dictionary.
# Go to Step 2.

A dictionary is initialized to contain the single-character strings corresponding to all the possible input characters (and nothing else except the clear and stop codes if they&#x27;re being used). The algorithm works by scanning through the input string for successively longer substrings until it finds one that is not in the dictionary. When such a string is found, the index for the string without the last character (i.e., the longest substring that &quot;is&quot; in the dictionary) is retrieved from the dictionary and sent to output, and the new string (including the last character) is added to the dictionary with the next available code. The last input character is then used as the next starting point to scan for substrings.

In this way, successively longer strings are registered in the dictionary and available for subsequent encoding as single output values. The algorithm works best on data with repeated patterns, so the initial parts of a message see little compression. As the message grows, however, the compression ratio tends asymptotically to the maximum (i.e., the compression factor or ratio improves on an increasing curve, and not linearly, approaching a theoretical maximum inside a limited time period rather than over infinite time).

===Decoding===
A high-level view of the decoding algorithm is shown here:
# Initialize the dictionary to contain all strings of length one.
# Read the next encoded symbol: Is it encoded in the dictionary?
##Yes:
###Emit the corresponding string W to output.
###Concatenate the previous string emitted to output with the first symbol of W. Add this to the dictionary.
##No:
###Concatenate the previous string emitted to output with its first symbol. Call this string V.
###Add V to the dictionary and emit V to output.
#Repeat Step 2 until end of input string
The decoding algorithm works by reading a value from the encoded input and outputting the corresponding string from the dictionary. However, the full dictionary is not needed, only the initial dictionary that contains single-character strings (and that is usually hard coded in the program, instead of sent with the encoded data). Instead, the full dictionary is rebuilt during the decoding process the following way: after decoding a value and outputting a string, the decoder concatenates it with the first character of the &quot;next&quot; decoded string (or the first character of current string, if the next one can&#x27;t be decoded; since if the next value is unknown, then it must be the value added to the dictionary in &quot;this&quot; iteration, and so its first character is the same as the first character of the current string), and updates the dictionary with the new string. The decoder then proceeds to the next input (which was already read in the previous iteration) and processes it as before, and so on until it has exhausted the input stream.

===Variable-width codes===
If variable-width codes are being used, the encoder and decoder must be careful to change the width at the same points in the encoded data so they don&#x27;t disagree on boundaries between individual codes in the stream. In the standard version, the encoder increases the width from &quot;p&quot; to &quot;p&quot; + 1 when a sequence ω + &quot;s&quot; is encountered that is not in the table (so that a code must be added for it) but the next available code in the table is 2&quot;p&quot; (the first code requiring &quot;p&quot; + 1 bits). The encoder emits the code for ω at width &quot;p&quot; (since that code does not require &quot;p&quot; + 1 bits), and then increases the code width so that the next code emitted is &quot;p&quot; + 1 bits wide.

The decoder is always one code behind the encoder in building the table, so when it sees the code for ω, it generates an entry for code 2&quot;p&quot; − 1. Since this is the point where the encoder increases the code width, the decoder must increase the width here as well—at the point where it generates the largest code that fits in &quot;p&quot; bits.

Unfortunately, some early implementations of the encoding algorithm increase the code width and &quot;then&quot; emit ω at the new width instead of the old width, so that to the decoder it looks like the width changes one code too early. This is called &quot;early change&quot;; it caused so much confusion that Adobe now allows both versions in PDF files, but includes an explicit flag in the header of each LZW-compressed stream to indicate whether early change is being used. Of the graphics file formats that support LZW compression, TIFF uses early change, while GIF and most others don&#x27;t.

When the table is cleared in response to a clear code, both encoder and decoder change the code width after the clear code back to the initial code width, starting with the code immediately following the clear code.

===Packing order===
Since the codes emitted typically do not fall on byte boundaries, the encoder and decoder must agree on how codes are packed into bytes. The two common methods are &quot;LSB-first&quot; (&quot;least significant bit first&quot;) and &quot;MSB-first&quot; (&quot;most significant bit first&quot;). In LSB-first packing, the first code is aligned so that the least significant bit of the code falls in the least significant bit of the first stream byte, and if the code has more than 8 bits, the high-order bits left over are aligned with the least significant bits of the next byte; further codes are packed with LSB going into the least significant bit not yet used in the current stream byte, proceeding into further bytes as necessary. MSB-first packing aligns the first code so that its &quot;most&quot; significant bit falls in the MSB of the first stream byte, with overflow aligned with the MSB of the next byte; further codes are written with MSB going into the most significant bit not yet used in the current stream byte.

GIF files use LSB-first packing order. TIFF files and PDF files use MSB-first packing order.

==Example==
The following example illustrates the LZW algorithm in action, showing the status of the output and the dictionary at every stage, both in encoding and decoding the data. This example has been constructed to give reasonable compression on a very short message. In real text data, repetition is generally less pronounced, so longer input streams are typically necessary before the compression builds up efficiency.

The plaintext to be encoded (from an alphabet using only the capital letters) is:

 TOBEORNOTTOBEORTOBEORNOT#

There are 26 symbols in the plaintext alphabet (the capital letters &quot;A&quot; through &quot;Z&quot;). &quot;#&quot; is used to represent a stop code: a code outside the plaintext alphabet that triggers special handling. We arbitrarily assign these the values 1 through 26 for the letters, and 0 for the stop code &#x27;#&#x27;. (Most flavors of LZW would put the stop code &quot;after&quot; the data alphabet, but nothing in the basic algorithm requires that. The encoder and decoder only have to agree what value it has.)

A computer renders these as strings of bits. Five-bit codes are needed to give sufficient combinations to encompass this set of 27 values. The dictionary is initialized with these 27 values. As the dictionary grows, the codes must grow in width to accommodate the additional entries. A 5-bit code gives 25 = 32 possible combinations of bits, so when the 33rd dictionary word is created, the algorithm must switch at that point from 5-bit strings to 6-bit strings (for &quot;all&quot; code values, including those previously output with only five bits). Note that since the all-zero code 00000 is used, and is labeled &quot;0&quot;, the 33rd dictionary entry is labeled 32. (Previously generated output is not affected by the code-width change, but once a 6-bit value is generated in the dictionary, it could conceivably be the next code emitted, so the width for subsequent output shifts to 6 bits to accommodate that.)

The initial dictionary, then, consists of the following entries:

===Encoding===
Buffer input characters in a sequence ω until ω + next character is not in the dictionary. Emit the code for ω, and add ω + next character to the dictionary. Start buffering again with the next character. (The string to be encoded is &quot;TOBEORNOTTOBEORTOBEORNOT#&quot;.)

:Unencoded length = 25 symbols × 5 bits/symbol = 125 bits
:Encoded length = (6 codes × 5 bits/code) + (11 codes × 6 bits/code) = 96 bits.

Using LZW has saved 29 bits out of 125, reducing the message by more than 23%. If the message were longer, then the dictionary words would begin to represent longer and longer sections of text, sending repeated words very compactly.

===Decoding===
To decode an LZW-compressed archive, one needs to know in advance the initial dictionary used, but additional entries can be reconstructed as they are always simply concatenations of previous entries.

At each stage, the decoder receives a code X; it looks X up in the table and outputs the sequence χ it codes, and it conjectures χ + ? as the entry the encoder just added – because the encoder emitted X for χ precisely because χ + ? was not in the table, and the encoder goes ahead and adds it. But what is the missing letter? It is the first letter in the sequence coded by the &quot;next&quot; code Z that the decoder receives. So the decoder looks up Z, decodes it into the sequence ω and takes the first letter z and tacks it onto the end of χ as the next dictionary entry.

This works as long as the codes received are in the decoder&#x27;s dictionary, so that they can be decoded into sequences. What happens if the decoder receives a code Z that is not yet in its dictionary? Since the decoder is always just one code behind the encoder, Z can be in the encoder&#x27;s dictionary only if the encoder &quot;just&quot; generated it, when emitting the previous code X for χ. Thus Z codes some ω that is χ + ?, and the decoder can determine the unknown character as follows:

# The decoder sees X and then Z, where X codes the sequence χ and Z codes some unknown sequence ω.
# The decoder knows that the encoder just added Z as a code for χ + some unknown character &quot;c&quot;, so ω = χ + &quot;c&quot;.
# Since &quot;c&quot; is the first character in the input stream after χ, and since ω is the string appearing immediately after χ, &quot;c&quot; must be the first character of the sequence ω.
# Since χ is an initial substring of ω, &quot;c&quot; must also be the first character of χ.
# So even though the Z code is not in the table, the decoder is able to infer the unknown sequence and adds χ + (the first character of χ) to the table as the value of Z.

This situation occurs whenever the encoder encounters input of the form &quot;cScSc&quot;, where &quot;c&quot; is a single character, &quot;S&quot; is a string and &quot;cS&quot; is already in the dictionary, but &quot;cSc&quot; is not. The encoder emits the code for &quot;cS&quot;, putting a new code for &quot;cSc&quot; into the dictionary. Next it sees &quot;cSc&quot; in the input (starting at the second &quot;c&quot; of &quot;cScSc&quot;) and emits the new code it just inserted. The argument above shows that whenever the decoder receives a code not in its dictionary, the situation must look like this.

Although input of form &quot;cScSc&quot; might seem unlikely, this pattern is fairly common when the input stream is characterized by significant repetition. In particular, long strings of a single character (which are common in the kinds of images LZW is often used to encode) repeatedly generate patterns of this sort.

==Further coding==
The simple scheme described above focuses on the LZW algorithm itself. Many applications apply further encoding to the sequence of output symbols. Some package the coded stream as printable characters using some form of binary-to-text encoding; this increases the encoded length and decreases the compression rate. Conversely, increased compression can often be achieved with an &quot;adaptive entropy encoder&quot;. Such a coder estimates the probability distribution for the value of the next symbol, based on the observed frequencies of values so far. A standard entropy encoding such as Huffman coding or arithmetic coding then uses shorter codes for values with higher probabilities.

== Uses ==
LZW compression became the first widely used universal data compression method on computers. A large English text file can typically be compressed via LZW to about half its original size.

LZW was used in the public-domain program compress, which became a more or less standard utility in Unix systems around 1986. It has since disappeared from many distributions, both because it infringed the LZW patent and because gzip produced better compression ratios using the LZ77-based DEFLATE algorithm, but as of 2008 at least FreeBSD includes both compress and uncompress as a part of the distribution. Several other popular compression utilities also used LZW or closely related methods.

LZW became very widely used when it became part of the GIF image format in 1987. It may also (optionally) be used in TIFF and PDF files. (Although LZW is available in Adobe Acrobat software, Acrobat by default uses DEFLATE for most text and color-table-based image data in PDF files.)

== Patents ==

Various patents have been issued in the United States and other countries for LZW and similar algorithms. LZ78 was covered by by Lempel, Ziv, Cohn, and Eastman, assigned to Sperry Corporation, later Unisys Corporation, filed on August 10, 1981. Two US patents were issued for the LZW algorithm: by Victor S. Miller and Mark N. Wegman and assigned to IBM, originally filed on June 1, 1983, and by Welch, assigned to Sperry Corporation, later Unisys Corporation, filed on June 20, 1983.

In addition to the above patents, Welch&#x27;s 1983 patent also includes citations to several other patents that influenced it, including two 1980 Japanese patents (JP9343880A and JP17790880A) from NEC&#x27;s Jun Kanatsu, (1974) from John S. Hoerning, (1977) from Klaus E. Holtz, and a 1981 German patent (DE19813118676) from Karl Eckhart Heinz.

In 1993–94, and again in 1999, Unisys Corporation received widespread condemnation when it attempted to enforce licensing fees for LZW in GIF images. The 1993–1994 Unisys-CompuServe controversy (CompuServe being the creator of the GIF format) prompted a Usenet comp.graphics discussion &quot;Thoughts on a GIF-replacement file format&quot;, which in turn fostered an email exchange that eventually culminated in the creation of the patent-unencumbered Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file format in 1995.

Unisys&#x27;s US patent on the LZW algorithm expired on June 20, 2003, 20 years after it had been filed. Patents that had been filed in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada all expired in 2004, likewise 20 years after they had been filed.

==Variants==
* LZMW (1985, by V. Miller, M. Wegman) – Searches input for the longest string already in the dictionary (the &quot;current&quot; match); adds the concatenation of the previous match with the current match to the dictionary. (Dictionary entries thus grow more rapidly; but this scheme is much more complicated to implement.) Miller and Wegman also suggest deleting low-frequency entries from the dictionary when the dictionary fills up.
* LZAP (1988, by James Storer) – modification of LZMW: instead of adding just the concatenation of the previous match with the current match to the dictionary, add the concatenations of the previous match with each initial substring of the current match (&quot;AP&quot; stands for &quot;all prefixes&quot;). For example, if the previous match is &quot;wiki&quot; and current match is &quot;pedia&quot;, then the LZAP encoder adds 5 new sequences to the dictionary: &quot;wikip&quot;, &quot;wikipe&quot;, &quot;wikiped&quot;, &quot;wikipedi&quot;, and &quot;wikipedia&quot;, where the LZMW encoder adds only the one sequence &quot;wikipedia&quot;. This eliminates some of the complexity of LZMW, at the price of adding more dictionary entries.
* LZWL is a syllable-based variant of LZW.
