<text>Mezcal (, ), sometimes spelled mescal, is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from any type of agave.

Agaves or magueys are endemic to the Americas and found globally as ornamental plants. Native fermented drinks from maguey plant, such as &quot;pulque&quot;, existed before the arrival of the Spanish, but the origin of mezcal is tied to the introduction of Filipino-type stills to New Spain by Filipino migrants via the Manila galleons in the late 1500s and early 1600s. These stills were initially used to make &quot;vino de coco&quot;, but they were quickly adopted by the indigenous peoples of the Pacific coastal regions of Mexico and applied to the distillation of agave to make mezcal.

Mezcal is made from the heart of the agave plant, called the . The &quot;Agave&quot; genus is a member of the Agavoideae subfamily of the Asparagaceae plant family which has almost 200 species. Mezcal is made from over 30 &quot;Agave&quot; species, varieties, and subvarieties, in contrast with tequila, which is made only with blue agave. 90% of Mexican mezcal comes from Oaxaca. In Mexico, mezcal is generally consumed straight and has a strong smoky flavor. Though other types of mezcal are not as popular as tequila, Mexico does export the product, mostly to Japan and the United States, and exports are increasing as the liquor grows in popularity.

Despite the similar name, mezcal does not contain mescaline or other psychedelic substances.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;mezcal&quot; comes from Nahuatl , which means &quot;baked agave&quot;, from &quot;agave&quot; and &quot;to bake&quot;. It is sometimes spelled &quot;mescal&quot;.

==History==

Pulque (a fermented drink from agave sap) is pre-colonial, but the distillation of agave heart juice into mezcal was only introduced in the colonial era when Filipino sailors and migrants brought the technology of Filipino-type stills with them during the galleon trade between Mexico and the Philippines (1565 to 1815). This is supported by ethnohistoric, botanical, archaeological, and toponymic evidence. Mezcal is the product of the merging of pre-Columbian indigenous fermentation traditions and Asian distillation techniques brought over from the Philippines.
Filipino-type stills, derived from Mongolian and East Asian stills, are very distinct from the more complex European-type alembic stills (derived from Arabic and Middle Eastern stills). They were cheap and easy to manufacture, though less efficient than alembic-type stills. They were made of a mixture of different easy-to-acquire materials. They usually consist of a hollowed-out log (usually from the parota tree) with two copper or iron pans. These were often substituted with larger capacity earthenware jars and bowls, bound wooden staves, or even metal cylinders. The upper pan is continually filled with cold water and functions as the condenser; while the bottom pan holds the fermented juice over the furnace, functioning as the boiler. The distillate is collected either by an internal container placed in between the two pans on a platform; or a spoon-shaped collector and gutter made from wood, rolled agave leaf, or carrizo cane (originally bamboo in the Philippines) that exits from the hollow log in between the pans to an external clay container. A modified version of this, usually called &quot;&quot; (lit. &quot;clay pot&quot;), use a specially-shaped clay vessel (or overlapped clay vessels) built into a furnace as the boiler chamber (doing away with the hollow log and the bottom pan). It only uses one pan (the condenser), but otherwise operates on the same principle. There are also many other modified variants, usually named after the indigenous peoples that use them, including the &quot;Tarascan still&quot; (or &quot;Tarasco still&quot;), &quot;Zapoteco still&quot;, &quot;Nahua still&quot;, &quot;Bolaños still&quot;, and &quot;Huichol still&quot; (the latter used for making sotol, not mezcal). Filipino-type stills are also still referred to by mezcal and tequila manufacturers (especially in Jalisco and Michoacán) as the &quot;Filipino still&quot; ().
These stills were initially used by Filipino settlers who established coconut plantations on the coastal regions of Guerrero and Colima of New Spain to make &quot;vino de coco&quot; (coconut liquor, also called &quot;lambanog&quot;). Over the centuries that the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade was active, an estimated 75,000 Filipinos settled western Mexico and intermarried with indigenous and mixed-race families. They passed the knowledge of these stills to local communities who applied it to distill fermented agave. The first historical record of mezcal production is from southern Jalisco, using techniques derived from coconut liquor production from Colima. 

By the early 1600s, the Spanish colonial government and the &quot;Real Audiencia&quot; in Spain banned &quot;vino de coco&quot; and issued an order for the destruction of coconut plantations in Colima because it competed with the sales of imported spirits from Spain. This was also the reason they did not initially introduce distillation to Mexico. Although this wasn&#x27;t complied with completely, the prohibition of &quot;vino de coco&quot; led to the expansion and commercialization of the production of mezcal to fill the local demand for cheap liquor. The first mention of distilled agave spirits in colonial records is from 1619, by the Spanish cleric Domingo Lázaro de Arregui. He mentions that the indigenous peoples in the coastal regions of the Sierra de Nayarit were distilling &quot;mexcales&quot;, which he describes as being obtained by distilling fermented juice from roasted agave leaf bases. By 1638, the governor of Nueva Galicia also started to regulate the sale of mezcal. Mezcal became banned shortly after, though its illicit trade continued. By 1643, there are records of mezcal and &quot;vino de coco&quot; being sold in Guadalajara.
The production of mezcal moved from the coastal river basins of the Río Grande de Santiago to the inland ravines by the early 1700s to evade the prohibition on indigenous spirits production, as well as to take advantage of the larger numbers of wild agave plants in the interiors. The plants used expanded to highland cultivars of &quot;Agave angustifolia&quot;, as well as &quot;Agave rhodacantha&quot; in Jalisco, and &quot;Agave hookeri&quot; in Michoacán. 

By the mid-1700s, the production of &quot;vino de coco&quot; had ceased completely due to the prohibition and the loss of coconut plantations. But mezcal liquor survived because they were sourced from abundant wild agaves which the Spanish could not eradicate. The production sites moved to even more remote and difficult-to-access areas in the foothills of the Volcán de Colima, the ravines of the Colima Valley, and in the Chamila Valley. During this period, the first clandestine distilleries in the highlands of Jalisco were also established in the valleys of Amatitán, Tequila, Magdalena, and El Arenal, whose mezcal variant made specifically from blue agave later became tequila. 

The small size of the Filipino-type stills made it easy to disassemble and move while evading colonial authorities. The numerous well-like ancient graves cut into the rocks in the region were also coopted as fermentation basins for agave juice. The small size of the still also allowed distillers to produce agave liquor from a very small number of agave plants or even a single plant. These conditions led to the constant selection and vegetative propagation of wild agave plants with the best characteristics for agave liquor production, eventually resulting in the development of domesticated cultivars of agave. 

In Colima, the fermented agave to be distilled into mezcal is still called &quot;tuba&quot; (a synonym of ), the term adopted from the &quot;tubâ&quot; used to ferment . The term &quot;tuba&quot; is also used for fermented sotol plant (genus &quot;Dasylirion&quot;) core juice, before its distillation into sotol liquor by the Huichol people, also indicative of its origins as an adaptation of production.

The oldest agave spirits distilleries (called &quot;tabernas&quot; or &quot;viñatas&quot;) use Filipino-type stills, many of which are still operational (like the Macario Partida distilleries in Zapotitlán de Vadillo, Jalisco). The technology was also transported through trade routes into Zacatecas, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Sonora, and the rest of Mexico, as well as parts of the southern United States, where modified Filipino-type stills have been reported. The alembic-type still, finally introduced by the Spanish for distilling sugarcane, was later also adopted for mezcal production. Most modern mass-produced mezcals are made using alembic-type stills, but the highest category of certification, the &quot;ancestral mezcal&quot; must be distilled using only Filipino-type stills.

=== Possible pre-colonial distillation ===

Some authors have also proposed the existence of a separate pre-colonial distillation of small quantities of agave for elites, based on an interpretation of the peculiarly-shaped double or triple-chambered Capacha Culture clay vessels as small stills. These vessels are known in Spanish as , and dates to c.1500 to 1000 BCE. They were hypothesized to have been capped with a condensing cold water-filled bowl, with a very small cup placed inside to collect the distillate. Modern replicas using this method have been successful in producing small quantities of spirits with an alcohol content as high as 35%. If the distillation of mezcal was indeed present in pre-Columbian Mexico, it would mean the introduction of Filipino-type stills merely expanded the production by using new techniques. However, the archaeological evidence for this remains inconclusive, as examination and molecular testing of ancient Capacha in 2019 have not detected any of the expected macroscopic botanical remains (like fibers) or chemical biomarkers for agave or any other high-sugar agricultural products (like fruits, cactus juice, honey, or corn) that could be distilled into spirits. Furthermore, all of the vessels are exclusively only found in association with tombs and burial sites (they are absent in utilitarian or industrial sites); they show completely no evidence of ever having been placed over a fire; and no cups or bowls have been recovered &quot;in situ&quot; in association with them.

==Regulation==
Internationally, mezcal has been recognized as an Appellation of Origin (AO, DO) since 1994. There is also a Geographical Indication (GI), originally limited to the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Durango, San Luis Potosí, Puebla and Zacatecas. Similar products are made in Jalisco, Guanajuato, Michoacán, and Tamaulipas, but these have not been included in the mezcal DO.

Traditionally the word &quot;mezcal&quot; has been used generally in Mexico for all agave spirits and it continues to be used for many agave spirits whether these spirits have been legally certified as &quot;mezcal&quot; or not. Within Mexico, mezcal is regulated under Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM) regulations, originally NOM-070-SCFI-1994 (in 1994), by the industry body Consejo Mexicano Regulador de la Calidad del Mezcal A.C. (COMERCAM, the Mexican Regulatory Council for Mezcal Quality). This regulation became law in 2003, and certification began in 2005.

Modern mezcal is divided into three categories certified by the Norma Oficial Mexicana:

* Mezcal – For mezcal produced with high-efficiency modern production methods and modern equipment like autoclaves, diffusers, and stainless steel or copper column stills. It is sometimes derisively referred to as &quot;industrial mezcal&quot; ().
* Artisanal mezcal () – For mezcal produced using artisanal stills. Autoclaves, diffusers, and column stills are prohibited. The agave hearts must be cooked in pit hearths or clay/brick ovens. Milling must be done with mallets, stone mills, or mechanical mills. The juice must be fermented in animal skins or pits or tanks made with stone, clay, or wood. The most common types of stills used are the copper or stainless steel alembic-type stills (used by the vast majority), the modified alembic-type stills with a (a cylinder of continuously flowing cold water surrounding the still head), and the Filipino-type stills. Mezcal produced in this way are distilled once, twice, or thrice, depending on the regional tradition, but the most common number of distillations is twice. The vast majority of certified mezcal belong to this category.
* Ancestral mezcal () – For mezcal produced completely by traditional methods. Stainless steel and modern equipment are prohibited. This requires the agave hearts to be pit-cooked and crushed by mallets or stone mills. The juice must be fermented in animal skins or pits or tanks made with stone, clay, or wood. It must only be distilled using Filipino-type stills made of clay or wood. 

Artisanal and ancestral mezcal are preferred due to the fact that the use of traditional materials like wood and clay impart and absorb flavors during distillation. Copper is also preferred for the metal parts of the stills as they remove undesirable sulfur flavors during distillation and do not impart flavors of their own to the product. Almost all artisanal and traditional stills use a copper component.

The three categories are further subdivided into six additional classes:

* &#x27; (&quot;white&quot;) or &#x27; (&quot;young&quot;) – refers unaged and unadulterated mezcal. Most mezcal belong to this class.
* (&quot;matured in glass&quot;) – refers to mezcal stored in glass for a year or more buried underground or in a location with minimal variation in temperature, light, and humidity. Burying is a traditional method for softening mezcal without reducing alcohol content.
* (&quot;rested&quot;) – refers to mezcal stored in a wooden vessel of any type or size for between 2 months to a year.
* (&quot;aged&quot;) – refers to mezcal stored in a wooden vessel of less than for more than a year.
* (&quot;easy to drink&quot;) – refers to mezcal that is flavored or infused with other ingredients. NOM specifically permits maguey &quot;worms&quot;, damiana, lime, orange, mango, and honey; but other fruits, herbs, and caramel are also commonly added.
* &#x27; (&quot;distilled with&quot;) or &#x27; (&quot;chicken breast mezcal&quot;) – refers to mezcal where the second or third distillation includes other ingredients like fruit, meat (hence the name), or herbs. This process is traditional.

The regulations have been controversial, not only from small artisanal producers for whom the cost of certification is prohibitive, but also from traditional producers outside the chosen GI states and those producers who believe that the term &quot;mezcal&quot; should not be owned by the state. Uncertified producers are prohibited from using the term &quot;mezcal&quot; on their products. Some producers and importers have responded by labeling their products as &quot;destilados de agave&quot; or &quot;agave spirits&quot;, a category now recognized by the United States&#x27; TTB and in increasing use.

In Canada, products that are labelled, packaged, sold or advertised as Mezcal must be manufactured in Mexico as mezcal under the stipulated guidelines. However, Canadian laws also allow for local bottling and resale of imported mezcal, after its alcohol percentage has been adjusted with the addition of distilled or purified water.
Currently uncertified agave spirits labeled as &quot;destilados de agave&quot; or &quot;agave spirits&quot; can also be bottled in the United States.

==Mezcal agave==

The &quot;Agave&quot; genus is a member of the Agavoideae subfamily of the Asparagaceae plant family (formerly included in the now defunct Agavaceae family) which has almost 200 species. There are more than 120 species of agave. The mezcal agave has very large, thick leaves with points at the ends. When it is mature, it forms a &quot;piña&quot; or heart in the center from which juice is extracted to convert into mezcal. It takes between seven and fifteen years for the plant to mature, depending on the species and whether it is cultivated or wild. Agave fields are a common sight in the semi-desert areas of Oaxaca state and other parts of Mexico.

=== Varieties ===
Mezcal is made from over 30 agave species, varieties, and subvarieties, in contrast with tequila, which is made only with blue agave. Of many agave species that can be used to make mezcal, seven are particularly notable. There is no exhaustive list, as the regulations allow any agaves, provided that they are not used as the primary material in other governmental Denominations of Origin. The term &quot;silvestre&quot; &quot;wild&quot; is sometimes found, but simply means that the agaves are wild (foraged, not cultivated); it is not a separate variety.

Most commonly used is &quot;espadín&quot; &quot;smallsword&quot; (&quot;Agave angustifolia&quot; (Haw.), var. &quot;espadín&quot;), the predominant agave in Oaxaca. The next most important are &quot;arroqueño&quot; (&quot;Agave americana&quot; (L.) var. &quot;oaxacensis&quot;, sub-variety arroqueño), &quot;cirial&quot; (&quot;Agave karwinskii&quot; (Zucc.)), &quot;barril&quot; (&quot;Agave rodacantha&quot; (Zucc.) var. &quot;barril&quot;), &quot;mexicano&quot; (&quot;Agave macroacantha&quot; or &quot;Agave rhodacantha&quot; var. &quot;mexicano&quot;, also called &quot;dobadaan&quot;) and &quot;cincoañero&quot; (&quot;Agave canatala&quot; Roxb). The most famous wild agave is &quot;tobalá&quot; (&quot;Agave potatorum&quot; (Zucc.)). Others include &quot;madrecuixe&quot;, &quot;tepeztate&quot;, &quot;jabalí&quot;, and &quot;bicuixe&quot;.

==Production==

Traditionally, mezcal is handcrafted by small-scale producers. A village can contain dozens of production houses, called &quot;fábricas&quot; or &quot;palenques&quot;, each using methods that have been passed down from generation to generation, some using the same techniques practiced 200 years ago. This is an important difference with tequila which is nowadays mostly produced industrially.

The process begins by harvesting the plants, which can weigh each, and extracting the &quot;piña&quot;, or heart, by cutting off the plant&#x27;s leaves and roots. The &quot;piñas&quot; are then cooked for about three days, often in pit ovens, which are earthen mounds over pits of hot rocks. This underground roasting gives mezcal its intense and distinctive smoky flavor. They are then crushed and mashed (traditionally by a stone wheel turned by a horse) and then left to ferment in large vats or barrels with water added.

The mash is allowed to ferment, the resulting liquid collected and distilled in either clay or copper pots which will further modify the flavor of the final product. The distilled product is then bottled and sold. Unaged mezcal is referred to as &quot;joven&quot;, or young. Some of the distilled product is left to age in barrels between one month and four years, but some can be aged for as long as 12 years. Mezcal can reach an alcohol content of 55%. Like tequila, mezcal is distilled twice. The first distillation is known as &quot;ordinario&quot;, and comes out at around 75 proof (37.5% alcohol by volume). The liquid must then be distilled a second time to raise the alcohol percentage.

Mezcal is highly varied, depending on the species of agave used, the fruits and herbs added during fermentation and the distillation process employed, creating subtypes with names such as &quot;de gusano, tobalá, pechuga, blanco, minero, cedrón, de alacrán, crema de café&quot; and more. A special recipe for a specific mezcal type known as &quot;de pechuga&quot; is distilled with a chicken breast. Other variations flavor the mash with cinnamon, pineapple slices, &quot;plátanos manzanos&quot;, and sugar, each imparting a particular character to the mezcal. Most mezcal, however, is left untouched, allowing the flavors of the agave used to come forward.

Not all bottles of mezcal contain a &quot;worm&quot; (actually the larva of a moth, &quot;Comadia redtenbacheri&quot;, that can infest agave plants), but if added, it is added during the bottling process. There are conflicting stories as to why such a thing would be added. Some state that it is a marketing ploy. Others state that it is there to prove that the mezcal is fit to drink, and still others state that the larva is there to impart flavor. Similar ingedients are scorpions (&quot;de alacrán&quot;) and snakes.

The two types of mezcal are those made of 100% agave and those mixed with other ingredients, with at least 60% agave. Both types have four categories. &quot;Joven&quot; (white) mezcal is clear and hardly aged. &quot;Dorado&quot; (golden) is not aged but caramel is added. This is more often done with a mixed mezcal. &quot;Reposado&quot; is aged in wood barrels from two to nine months. This can be done with 100% agave or mixed mezcals. &quot;Añejo&quot; is aged in barrels for a minimum of 12 months. The best of this type are generally aged from 18 months to three years. If the &quot;añejo&quot; is of 100% agave, it is usually aged for about four years.

Mexico has about cultivating agave for mezcal, owned by 9,000 producers. Over are produced in Mexico annually, with more than 150 brand names.

The industry generates about 29,000 jobs directly and indirectly. Certified production in 2008 amounted to more than ; were exported, generating 21 million dollars in income. To truly be called mezcal, the liquor must come from certain areas. States that have certified mezcal agave growing areas with production facilities are Durango, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Oaxaca, San Luis Potosí, Puebla, Michoacan, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas. About 30 species of agave are certified for use in the production of mezcal. Oaxaca has 570 of the 625 mezcal production facilities in Mexico, but some in-demand mezcals come from Guerrero, as well. In Tamaulipas, 11 municipalities have received authorization to produce authentic mezcal with the hopes of competing for a piece of both the Mexican national and international markets. The agave used here is &quot;agave Americano, agave verde&quot; or &quot;maguey de la Sierra&quot;, which are native to the state.

Oaxaca produces 90% of the mezcal in Mexico, which presents a serious environmental threat to the state, according to local deputy Elena Cuevas Hernández. She notes that of water and of firewood are required for the production of of mezcal, which comes to per batch consuming of water and of firewood. In 2019 Mexico produced of mezcal and consumed of water and of wood. Water is used both for irrigation of the maguey plants and cooling the distilled product; wood is used to bake the leaves. Certain communities already control or prohibit cutting firewood. The deputy also warns of pollution related to inadequate disposal of rotting stalks left in the fields and pollutants with low pH (3 or 4) and methane (CH4). Yet another problem is the low pay that producers receive.

Despite the similar name, mezcal does not contain mescaline or other psychedelic substances.

==Drinking==
In Mexico, mezcal is generally drunk straight, rather than mixed in a cocktail. Mezcal is generally not mixed with any other liquids, but is often accompanied with sliced oranges, lemon or lime sprinkled with a mixture of ground fried larvae, ground chili peppers, and salt called &quot;sal de gusano&quot;, which literally translates as &quot;worm salt&quot;. A saying attributed to Oaxaca regarding the drink is: &quot;&quot; (&quot;For all bad, mezcal, and for all good, as well; and if there is no remedy, liter and a half&quot;).

In the US, Europe and Japan, mezcal is increasingly becoming a prominent ingredient on many craft cocktail menus. Often mezcal is swapped for a more traditional spirit, in cocktails such as the &quot;mezcal old fashioned&quot; and the &quot;mezcal Negroni&quot;.

==Exportation==
In the 21st century, mezcal, especially from Oaxaca, has been exported. Exportation has been on the increase and government agencies have been helping smaller-scale producers obtain the equipment and techniques needed to produce higher quantities and qualities for export. The National Program of Certification of the Quality of Mezcal certifies places of origin for export products. Mezcal is sold in 27 countries on three continents. The two countries that import the most are the United States and Japan, and exports are increasing as the liquor grows in popularity. In the United States, a number of entrepreneurs have teamed up with Mexican producers to sell their products in the country, by promoting its handcrafted quality, as well as the Oaxacan culture strongly associated with it.

The booming industry has been met with opposition from ecological activists, in 2021 San-Francisco based neozapatismo news outlet Radio Zapatista, released an article on the damage the industry and its mass-production is doing to the environment of the Mixteca Region and the cultures of the region.

==Festival==
The state of Oaxaca sponsors the International Mezcal Festival every year in the capital city, Oaxaca de Juárez. There, locals and tourists can sample and buy a large variety of mezcals made in the state. Mezcals from other states, such as Guerrero, Guanajuato, and Zacatecas also participate. This festival was started in 1997 to accompany the yearly Guelaguetza festival. In 2009, the festival had over 50,000 visitors, and brought in 4 million pesos to the economy.

== In the media ==
On September 29, 2024, &quot;CBS 60 Minutes&quot; contained a segment &quot;The Mezcaleros&quot; on the tradition of Mezcal in Oaxaca, Mexico.

<text>Acastus (; Ancient Greek: Ἄκαστος) is a character in Greek mythology. He sailed with Jason and the Argonauts, and participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar.

==Family==
Acastus was the son of Pelias, then king of Iolcus, and Anaxibia (Philomache in some traditions). Acastus with his wife Astydamia (also called Hippolyte, daughter of Cretheus) had two daughters: Sterope and Laodamia, and a number of sons. Another daughter, Sthenele, was given by the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; as the wife of Menoetius and mother of Patroclus.

==Mythology==
After the return of the Argonauts, Acastus&#x27;s sisters were manipulated by Medea to cut their father Pelias in pieces and boil them. Acastus, when he heard this, buried his father, and drove Jason and Medea from Iolcus (and, according to Pausanias, his sisters also), and instituted funeral games in honor of his father. He thereafter became king of Iolcus.

Acastus purified Peleus of the murder of King Eurytion of Phthia. Acastus&#x27;s wife (variously named in mythology; often Astydamia, but sometimes Hippolyte, daughter of Cretheus) fell in love with Peleus but he scorned her. Bitter, she sent a messenger to Antigone, Peleus&#x27;s wife and daughter of Eurytion, to tell her that Peleus was to marry Acastus&#x27;s daughter, Sterope.

Astydamia then told Acastus that Peleus had tried to rape her. Acastus took Peleus on a hunting trip and hid his sword while he slept, then abandoned him on Mt. Pelion to be killed by centaurs. The wise centaur Chiron (or the god Hermes) returned Peleus&#x27; sword and Peleus managed to escape. With Jason and the Dioscuri, Peleus sacked Iolcus, dismembered Astydamia (and, in some accounts, Acastus himself), and marched his army between the pieces. Their kingdom later fell to Jason&#x27;s son Thessalus.

<doc id="81094" wikidata="Q108163" url="?curid=81094" title="Proposition">
<text>A proposition is a central concept in the philosophy of language, semantics, logic, and related fields, often characterized as the primary bearer of truth or falsity. Propositions are also often characterized as the type of object that declarative sentences denote. For instance, the sentence &quot;The sky is blue&quot; denotes the proposition that the sky is blue. However, crucially, propositions are not themselves linguistic expressions. For instance, the English sentence &quot;Snow is white&quot; denotes the same proposition as the German sentence &quot;Schnee ist weiß&quot; even though the two sentences are not the same. Similarly, propositions can also be characterized as the objects of belief and other propositional attitudes. For instance if someone believes that the sky is blue, the object of their belief is the proposition that the sky is blue.

Formally, propositions are often modeled as functions which map a possible world to a truth value. For instance, the proposition that the sky is blue can be modeled as a function which would return the truth value formula_1 if given the actual world as input, but would return formula_2 if given some alternate world where the sky is green. However, a number of alternative formalizations have been proposed, notably the structured propositions view.

Propositions have played a large role throughout the history of logic, linguistics, philosophy of language, and related disciplines. Some researchers have doubted whether a consistent definition of propositionhood is possible, David Lewis even remarking that &quot;the conception we associate with the word ‘proposition’ may be something of a jumble of conflicting desiderata&quot;. The term is often used broadly and has been used to refer to various related concepts.

==Relation to the mind==
In relation to the mind, propositions are discussed primarily as they fit into propositional attitudes. Propositional attitudes are simply attitudes characteristic of folk psychology (belief, desire, etc.) that one can take toward a proposition (e.g. &#x27;it is raining,&#x27; &#x27;snow is white,&#x27; etc.). In English, propositions usually follow folk psychological attitudes by a &quot;that clause&quot; (e.g. &quot;Jane believes &quot;that&quot; it is raining&quot;). In philosophy of mind and psychology, mental states are often taken to primarily consist in propositional attitudes. The propositions are usually said to be the &quot;mental content&quot; of the attitude. For example, if Jane has a mental state of believing that it is raining, her mental content is the proposition &#x27;it is raining.&#x27; Furthermore, since such mental states are &quot;about&quot; something (namely, propositions), they are said to be intentional mental states.

Explaining the relation of propositions to the mind is especially difficult for non-mentalist views of propositions, such as those of the logical positivists and Russell described above, and Gottlob Frege&#x27;s view that propositions are Platonist entities, that is, existing in an abstract, non-physical realm. So some recent views of propositions have taken them to be mental. Although propositions cannot be particular thoughts since those are not shareable, they could be types of cognitive events or properties of thoughts (which could be the same across different thinkers).

Philosophical debates surrounding propositions as they relate to propositional attitudes have also recently centered on whether they are internal or external to the agent, or whether they are mind-dependent or mind-independent entities.

In modern logic, propositions are standardly understood semantically as indicator functions that take a possible world and return a truth value. For example, the proposition that the sky is blue could be represented as a function formula_3 such that formula_4 for every world formula_5 if any, where the sky is blue, and formula_6 for every world formula_7 if any, where it is not. A proposition can be modeled equivalently with the inverse image of formula_8 under the indicator function, which is sometimes called the &quot;characteristic set&quot; of the proposition. For instance, if formula_9 and formula_10 are the only worlds in which the sky is blue, the proposition that the sky is blue could be modeled as the set formula_11.

Numerous refinements and alternative notions of proposition-hood have been proposed including inquisitive propositions and structured propositions. Propositions are called structured propositions if they have constituents, in some broad sense. Assuming a structured view of propositions, one can distinguish between singular propositions (also Russellian propositions, named after Bertrand Russell) which are about a particular individual, general propositions, which are not about any particular individual, and particularized propositions, which are about a particular individual but do not contain that individual as a constituent.

==Objections to propositions==
Attempts to provide a workable definition of proposition include the following:

Two meaningful declarative sentences express the same proposition, if and only if they mean the same thing.

which defines &quot;proposition&quot; in terms of synonymity. For example, &quot;Snow is white&quot; (in English) and &quot;Schnee ist weiß&quot; (in German) are different sentences, but they say the same thing, so they express the same proposition. Another definition of proposition is:
Two meaningful declarative sentence-tokens express the same proposition, if and only if they mean the same thing.

The above definitions can result in two identical sentences/sentence-tokens appearing to have the same meaning, and thus expressing the same proposition and yet having different truth-values, as in &quot;I am Spartacus&quot; said by Spartacus and said by John Smith, and &quot;It is Wednesday&quot; said on a Wednesday and on a Thursday. These examples reflect the problem of ambiguity in common language, resulting in a mistaken equivalence of the statements. “I am Spartacus” spoken by Spartacus is the declaration that the individual speaking is called Spartacus and it is true. When spoken by John Smith, it is a declaration about a different speaker and it is false. The term “I” means different things, so “I am Spartacus” means different things.

A related problem is when identical sentences have the same truth-value, yet express different propositions. The sentence “I am a philosopher” could have been spoken by both Socrates and Plato. In both instances, the statement is true, but means something different.

These problems are addressed in predicate logic by using a variable for the problematic term, so that “X is a philosopher” can have Socrates or Plato substituted for X, illustrating that “Socrates is a philosopher” and “Plato is a philosopher” are different propositions. Similarly, “I am Spartacus” becomes “X is Spartacus”, where X is replaced with terms representing the individuals Spartacus and John Smith.

In other words, the example problems can be averted if sentences are formulated with precision such that their terms have unambiguous meanings.

A number of philosophers and linguists claim that all definitions of a proposition are too vague to be useful. For them, it is just a misleading concept that should be removed from philosophy and semantics. W. V. Quine, who granted the existence of sets in mathematics, maintained that the indeterminacy of translation prevented any meaningful discussion of propositions, and that they should be discarded in favor of sentences. P. F. Strawson, on the other hand, advocated for the use of the term &quot;statement&quot;.

==Historical usage==

===By Aristotle===

In Aristotelian logic a proposition was defined as a particular kind of sentence (a declarative sentence) that affirms or denies a predicate of a subject, optionally with the help of a copula. Aristotelian propositions take forms like &quot;All men are mortal&quot; and &quot;Socrates is a man.&quot;

Aristotelian logic identifies a categorical proposition as a sentence which affirms or denies a predicate of a subject, optionally with the help of a copula. An Aristotelian proposition may take the form of &quot;All men are mortal&quot; or &quot;Socrates is a man.&quot; In the first example, the subject is &quot;men&quot;, predicate is &quot;mortal&quot; and copula is &quot;are&quot;, while in the second example, the subject is &quot;Socrates&quot;, the predicate is &quot;a man&quot; and copula is &quot;is&quot;.

===By the logical positivists===
Often, propositions are related to closed formulae (or logical sentence) to distinguish them from what is expressed by an open formula. In this sense, propositions are &quot;statements&quot; that are truth-bearers. This conception of a proposition was supported by the philosophical school of logical positivism.

Some philosophers argue that some (or all) kinds of speech or actions besides the declarative ones also have propositional content. For example, yes–no questions present propositions, being inquiries into the truth value of them. On the other hand, some signs can be declarative assertions of propositions, without forming a sentence nor even being linguistic (e.g. traffic signs convey definite meaning which is either true or false).

Propositions are also spoken of as the content of beliefs and similar intentional attitudes, such as desires, preferences, and hopes. For example, &quot;I desire &quot;that I have a new car&quot;&quot;, or &quot;I wonder &quot;whether it will snow&quot;&quot; (or, whether it is the case that &quot;it will snow&quot;). Desire, belief, doubt, and so on, are thus called propositional attitudes when they take this sort of content.

===By Russell===
Bertrand Russell held that propositions were structured entities with objects and properties as constituents. One important difference between Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s view (according to which a proposition is the set of possible worlds/states of affairs in which it is true) is that on the Russellian account, two propositions that are true in all the same states of affairs can still be differentiated. For instance, the proposition &quot;two plus two equals four&quot; is distinct on a Russellian account from the proposition &quot;three plus three equals six&quot;. If propositions are sets of possible worlds, however, then all mathematical truths (and all other necessary truths) are the same set (the set of all possible worlds).

<text>Cannes (, ; , ; ) is a city located on the French Riviera. It is a commune located in the Alpes-Maritimes department, and host city of the annual Cannes Film Festival, Midem, and Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. The city is known for its association with the rich and famous, its luxury hotels and restaurants, and for several conferences.

==History==
By the 2nd century BC, the Ligurian Oxybii established a settlement here known as &quot;Aegitna&quot; (). Historians are unsure what the name means, but the connection to Greek αἴγες &quot;waves, surf&quot; seems evident. The second element could be compared to the Cretan and Thessalian towns of Itanos () and Iton (); also phonetically close is the Aetolian town of Aegitium (). The area was a fishing village used as a port of call between the Lérins Islands.
In 154 BC, it became the scene of violent but quick conflict between the troops of Quintus Opimius and the Oxybii.

In the 10th century, the town was known as Canua. The name may derive from &quot;canna&quot;, a reed. Canua was probably the site of a small Ligurian port, and later a Roman outpost on Le Suquet hill, suggested by Roman tombs discovered here. Le Suquet housed an 11th-century tower, which overlooked the swamps where the city now stands. Most of the ancient activity, especially protection, was on the Lérins Islands, and the history of Cannes is closely tied to the history of the islands.

An attack by the Saracens in 891, who remained until the end of the 10th century, devastated the country around Canua. The insecurity of the Lérins islands forced the monks to settle on the mainland, at the Suquet. Construction of a castle in 1035 fortified the city then known as Cannes, and at the end of the 11th century construction was started on two towers on the Lérins islands. One took a century to build.

Around 1530, Cannes detached from the monks who had controlled the city for hundreds of years and became independent.

During the 18th century, both the Spanish and British tried to gain control of the Lérins Islands but were chased away by the French. The islands were later controlled by many, such as Jean-Honoré Alziary and the Bishop of Fréjus. They had many different purposes: in the middle of the 19th century, one served as a hospital for soldiers wounded in the Crimean War.

Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux bought land at the Croix des Gardes &quot;about the year 1838, when it was little more than a fishing village on a picturesque coast&quot; and constructed the villa Eleonore-Louise; Brougham&#x27;s work to improve living conditions attracted the English aristocracy, who also built winter residences.
The 19th century saw the modernization of Cannes, spearheaded by Marie de Lametz and her son Prince Charles III to follow the successes of nearby Nice and the successful gambling industry in Bad Homburg. After several failures in 1850s, the late 1860s saw an expansion of casino, villas, hotels, roads and railway (the distance from Paris to Cannes reduced to 23 hours). The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1876.

At the end of the 19th century, several more railways were completed, which prompted the arrival of streetcars. In Cannes, projects such as the Boulevard Carnot and the rue d&#x27;Antibes were carried out. After the closure of the Casino des Fleurs (hôtel Gallia), a luxury establishment was built for the rich winter clientele, the Casino Municipal next to the pier Albert-Edouard. This casino was demolished and replaced by the new Palace in 1979.

In the 20th century, new luxury hotels such as the Carlton, Majestic, Martinez, and JW Marriott Cannes were built. The city was modernised with a sports centre, a post office, and schools. There were fewer British and German tourists after the First World War, but more Americans. Winter tourism gave way to summer tourism, and the summer casino at Palm Beach was constructed.

In 1931, Karan Singh the crown prince of Jammu and Kashmir was born at the Martinez Hotel.

The city council had the idea of starting an international film festival shortly after World War II.

On 3 November 2011, it hosted the 2011 G20 summit.

In 2021, Cannes was designated as the City of Film by the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.

==Climate==
Cannes has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;) and the city enjoys 11 hours of sunshine per day during summer (July), while in winter (December to February) the weather is mild. Both seasons see a relatively low rainfall and most rain occurs during October and November when over falls.

Cannes summers are long and warm, with summer daytime temperatures regularly hitting , while average temperatures are about . Temperatures remain high from June to September, the busiest time of the year.

Mean temperatures drop below for only three months of the year (December to February). The spring and autumn are also warm, although more suited to those who prefer slightly cooler weather.

The record high temperature was on 19 July 2023, while the record low temperature was on 9 January 1985.

==Population==

==Landmarks==

The Promenade de la Croisette is the waterfront avenue with palm trees. La Croisette is known for picturesque beaches, restaurants, cafés, boutiques, and luxury hotels. Le Suquet, the old town, provides a good view of La Croisette. The fortified tower and the Chapelle Sainte-Anne house the Musée des Explorations du monde. A distinctive building in Cannes is the Russian Orthodox church.

===Hotels===
===Villas===

Cannes of the 19th century can still be seen in its grand villas, built to reflect the wealth and standing of their owners and inspired by anything from medieval castles to Roman villas. They are not open to the public. Lord Brougham&#x27;s Italianate Villa Eléonore Louise (one of the first in Cannes) was built between 1835 and 1839. Also known as the Quartier des Anglais, this is the oldest residential area in Cannes. Another landmark is the Villa Fiésole (known today as the Villa Domergue) designed by Jean-Gabriel Domergue in the style of Fiesole, near Florence, which may be visited on appointment.

=== Île Sainte-Marguerite ===

It took the Man in the Iron Mask 11 years to leave the tiny, forested St Marguerite Island. The mysterious individual was believed to be of noble blood, but his identity has never been proven. His cell can be visited in the Fort of St Marguerite, now renamed the Musée de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses discoveries from shipwrecks off the island, including Roman (1st century BC) and Saracen (10th century AD) ceramics.

=== Île Saint-Honorat ===

Cistercian monks are the only inhabitants of the smaller, southern St Honorat Island. Monks have inhabited the island since AD 410 and, at the height of their powers, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the seashore. The monks inhabit the Lérins Abbey and divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wines.

===Museums===
The Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire de Provence houses artifacts from prehistoric to present, in an 18th-century mansion. The Musée de la Castre has objects from the Pacific Atolls, Peruvian relics, and Mayan pottery. Other venues include the Musée de la Marine, Musée de la Mer, Musée de la Photographie and Musée International de la Parfumerie.

===Theatre and music===
Small venues stage productions and host short sketches during the annual International Actors&#x27; Performance Festival (Festival Performance d&#x27;Acteur).
 Local theaters include the Théâtre Debussy, the Espace Miramar and the Alexandre III.

<text>Rio Bravo is a 1959 American Western film directed and produced by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond. Written by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, based on the short story &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; by B.H. McCampbell, the film stars Wayne as a Texan sheriff who arrests the brother of a powerful local rancher for murder and then has to hold the man in jail until a U.S. Marshal can arrive. With the help of a lame old man, a drunk, and a young gunfighter, they hold off the rancher&#x27;s gang. &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; was filmed on location at Old Tucson Studios outside Tucson, Arizona, in Eastmancolor, with film processing provided by Technicolor.

In 2014, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

Joe Burdette, the spoiled younger brother of wealthy land baron Nathan Burdette, taunts town drunk Dude by tossing money into a spittoon. The sheriff, John T. Chance, stops Dude from reaching into the spittoon, prompting Dude to lash out and knock Chance unconscious. Joe starts to beat up Dude for fun, then shoots and kills an unarmed bystander who had tried to intervene. Chance recovers, follows Joe into Nathan&#x27;s personal saloon, and, with help from a penitent Dude, arrests Joe for murder.

Chance&#x27;s friend Pat Wheeler attempts to enter town with a wagon train of supplies and dynamite, but has to force his way through Nathan Burdette&#x27;s men. Chance reveals that he, Dude (who used to be a deputy before he became a drunk), and his lame old deputy Stumpy are all that stand between Nathan&#x27;s small army and Joe, whom they wish to free. Chance notices young gunslinger Colorado Ryan in Wheeler&#x27;s wagon train, but Colorado promises he doesn&#x27;t want to start any trouble.

That night, Carlos Robante, the owner of the local hotel, warns Chance that Wheeler is trying to recruit fighters. Chance tries to stop Wheeler, not wanting anyone to get hurt on his account. Wheeler asks if Colorado could help, but Colorado declines, feeling that it&#x27;s not his fight. Chance then notices a rigged card game at the hotel. Recognizing one of the players as &quot;Feathers&quot;, the widow of a cheating gambler, Chance confronts her. However, Colorado reveals that another player is the cheater.

Out in the street, Wheeler is gunned down. Chance and Dude pursue the killer into Nathan&#x27;s saloon, and Chance allows Dude to prove himself and confront the killer, earning the respect of Nathan&#x27;s men. Colorado and the rest of Wheeler&#x27;s men are forced to stay in town to await a court order releasing Wheeler&#x27;s possessions, and the wagons are left behind the Burdette warehouse. After Feathers secretly stays up all night with a shotgun to guard Chance, an irritated Chance orders Feathers to leave town for her safety. She refuses, and the two begin to bond.

Nathan himself rides into town. Stumpy, having old grudges against Nathan for taking his land, threatens to shoot Joe if any trouble starts around the jail. In response, Nathan has his saloon musicians repeatedly play &quot;El Degüello&quot;, &quot;The Cutthroat Song&quot;. Colorado realizes the song means Nathan will show no mercy, and warns Chance.

Chance gives Dude back his old guns, some clothes and a black hat he left behind when he became a drunkard. Dude also gets a shave, trying to start afresh. Unfortunately, Stumpy doesn&#x27;t recognize Dude when he returns, and shoots at him, shattering Dude&#x27;s nerves. The next day, Dude is still shaky and is ambushed by Burdette&#x27;s men, who threaten to kill him unless Chance lets Joe go. Colorado and Feathers distract the men long enough for Chance to get his rifle, and he and Colorado shoot down the men and free Dude. Dude thinks about quitting and letting Colorado take his place, but when he hears &quot;El Degüello&quot; being played, he resolves to see the thing through to the end.

Dude and Chance return to the hotel so Dude can take a bath. Burdette&#x27;s men capture Carlos&#x27; wife Consuelo and deliberately make her scream, which lures Dude and Chance into a trap. Dude tells Chance to take the men to the jail, under the pretext that Stumpy would let Joe out. However, Stumpy opens fire, as Dude secretly predicted. In the chaos, some men drag Dude off to Nathan, who demands a tradeDude for Joe. Chance agrees, but brings Colorado as backup. Dude and Joe brawl during the trade, and a firefight ensues. Stumpy throws some sticks of dynamite from the wagons into the warehouse where Burdette and his men are holed up; Chance and Dude detonate them with their guns, abruptly ending the fight.

With both Burdettes and their few surviving gunmen in jail, Chance finally spends some time with Feathers and admits his feelings for her. Colorado volunteers to guard the jail, allowing Stumpy and Dude to enjoy a night out in the town.

Malcolm Atterbury and Harry Carey Jr. also receive screen credits in the film&#x27;s opening, but their scenes were deleted from the final film.

==Production==

Exteriors for the film were shot at Old Tucson Studios, just outside Tucson. Filming took place in the summer of 1958, and the movie&#x27;s credits gave 1958 for the copyright; the film was released in March 1959.

&quot;Rio Bravo&quot; is generally regarded as one of Hawks&#x27; best, and is known for its long opening scene which contains no dialogue. The film received favorable reviews, and was successful, taking in US$5.75 million, the highest grossing Western of 1959.

A brief clip from &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; was among the archive footage later incorporated into the opening sequence of Wayne&#x27;s last film, &quot;The Shootist,&quot; to illustrate the backstory of Wayne&#x27;s character.

As was often the case in a John Wayne Western, Wayne wore his &quot;Red River D&quot; belt buckle in the movie. It can be clearly seen in the scene when Nathan Burdette comes to visit his brother Joe in the jail where he is being held for the U.S. Marshal, about 60 minutes into the film; and again in the scene where Wayne, Ricky Nelson, and Angie Dickinson deal with three of Burdette&#x27;s men in front of the hotel.

The story was credited to &quot;B.H. McCampbell.&quot; According to Todd McCarthy&#x27;s 1997 biography, &quot;Howard Hawks: The Grey Fox of Hollywood&quot;, this was actually Hawks&#x27; eldest daughter, Barbara Hawks McCampbell (McCampbell being her married name). Her contribution was the idea of using dynamite in the final shootout.

==Soundtrack==

The musical score was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin. His score includes the hauntingly ominous &quot;El Degüello&quot; theme, which is heard several times. The Colorado character identifies the tune as &quot;The Cutthroat Song&quot;. He relates that the song was played on the orders of General Antonio López de Santa Anna to the Texans holed up in the Alamo, to signify that no quarter would be given to them. The tune was used in Wayne&#x27;s film &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960). Composer Ennio Morricone recalled that director Sergio Leone asked him to write &quot;Dimitri Tiomkin music&quot; for &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;. The trumpet theme is similar to Tiomkin&#x27;s &quot;Degüello&quot; (the Italian title of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; was &quot;Un dollaro d&#x27;onore&quot;, &quot;A Dollar of Honor&quot;).

Because the film starred a crooner, Martin, and a teen idol, Nelson, Hawks included three songs in the soundtrack. Before the big showdown, in the jail house, Martin sings &quot;My Rifle, My Pony, and Me&quot; (which contains new lyrics by Webster to a Tiomkin tune that appeared in &quot;Red River&quot;), accompanied by Nelson, after which Nelson sings a brief version of &quot;Get Along Home, Cindy&quot;, accompanied by Martin and Brennan. Over the closing credits, Martin, backed by the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, sings a specially composed song, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, written by Tiomkin with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster. Nelson later paid homage to both the film and his character, Colorado, by including the song &quot;Restless Kid&quot; on his 1959 LP, &quot;Ricky Sings Again&quot;.

Members of the Western Writers of America chose &quot;My Rifle, My Pony, and Me&quot; as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.

==&quot;High Noon&quot; debate==

The film was made as a response to &quot;High Noon&quot;, which is sometimes thought to be an allegory for blacklisting in Hollywood, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. Wayne later called &quot;High Noon&quot; &quot;un-American&quot; and said he did not regret helping run the writer, Carl Foreman, out of the country. Director Howard Hawks went on the record to criticize &quot;High Noon&quot; by saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think a good sheriff was going to go running around town like a chicken with his head cut off asking for help, and finally his Quaker wife had to save him.&quot; According to film historian Emanuel Levy, Wayne and Hawks teamed up deliberately to rebut &quot;High Noon&quot; by telling a somewhat similar story their own way: portraying a hero who does not show fear or inner conflict and who never repudiates his commitment to public duty, while only allying himself with capable people, despite offers of help from many other characters. Chance also cites concerns for the safety of those that offer to help and his fears are confirmed when the first such offer results in the character being quickly killed. In &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;, Chance is surrounded by allies—a deputy who is brave and good with a gun, despite recovering from alcoholism (Dude), a young untried but self-assured gunfighter (Colorado), a limping, crippled old man who is doggedly loyal (Stumpy), a Mexican innkeeper (Carlos), his wife (Consuelo), and an attractive young woman (Feathers)—and repeatedly turns down aid from anyone he does not think is capable of helping him.

==Reception==

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; was not originally even reviewed for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;; Leslie Halliwell gave the film two out of four stars in his &quot;Film Guide&quot;, describing it as a &quot;cheerfully overlong and slow-moving Western&quot; that was nevertheless &quot;very watchable for those with time to spare&quot;. The film was taken more seriously by British critics such as Robin Wood, who rated it as his top film of all time and wrote a book on it in 2003 for the British Film Institute, publishers of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;. Pauline Kael called the film &quot;silly, but with zest; there are some fine action sequences, and the performers seem to be enjoying their roles.&quot; &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; was the second highest-ranking Western (63rd overall) in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films ever made. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Western Films list.

Director Quentin Tarantino called &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; his &quot;favorite &#x27;hangout&#x27; movie&quot;. He once said that if his date doesn&#x27;t like the film, there will be no relationship.

==Legacy==
Howard Hawks went on to direct two loose variations of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; with the idea of a sheriff defending his office against belligerent outlaws. John Wayne starred in both films, released as &quot;El Dorado&quot; in 1966 with Robert Mitchum playing a variation of Dean Martin&#x27;s original role, and &quot;Rio Lobo&quot; in 1970.

The 1976 film &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; directed by John Carpenter was inspired by the story and setting of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;.

==Music==
* &quot;My Rifle, My Pony and Me&quot;—sung by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson
* &quot;Cindy&quot;—sung by Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin and Walter Brennan
* &quot;Rio Bravo&quot;—sung by Dean Martin (end credits)

<text>In Greek mythology, Acrisius (; Ancient Greek: Ἀκρίσιος means &#x27;ill-judgment&#x27;) was a king of Argos. He was the grandfather of the famous Greek demi-god Perseus.

== Family ==
Acrisius was the son of Abas and Aglaea (or Ocalea, depending on the author), grandson of Lynceus, great-grandson of Aegyptus. He was the twin brother of Proetus and the half brother of Lyrcus. Acrisius was the husband of Eurydice or Aganippe and thus grandfather of the hero Perseus through their daughter Danae. His other daughter was Evarete, wife of King Oenomaus of Pisa in Elis.

== Mythology ==
=== Rivalry of twins ===
Acrisius and Proetus were said to have quarrelled even in the womb of their mother and when Abas died and Acrisius had grown up, he expelled Proetus from his inheritance. On his exile, Proetus was supported by his father-in-law Iobates, the Lycian, Proetus returned, and Acrisius was compelled to share his kingdom with his brother by giving Tiryns to him, while he retained Argos for himself.

In one version of the myth, there is no mention of the dispute between the two brothers but they divided the kingdom, Acrisius remained where he was at Argos and Proetus took over the Heraeum, Mideia, Tiryns, and the Argive coast region.

===Death===
Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consults the Oracle at Delphi, who warns him that he will one day be killed by his daughter’s son. Danaë is childless and to keep her so, he imprisons her in a bronze chamber open to the sky in the courtyard of his palace. Zeus impregnates her in the form of a golden shower (some accounts say it is her uncle, Proetus, who impregnates her). Danaë becomes pregnant with Perseus. Acrisius puts the child and Danaë in a chest and throws it into the sea. Zeus asks Poseidon to calm the water; he does and Danaë and Perseus survive, washing up on the island of Seriphos. A fisherman named Dictys, brother of King Polydectes, finds the pair and takes care of them.

Perseus grows up to be a hero, killing Medusa and rescuing Andromeda. Perseus and Danaë return to Argos with Andromeda, but King Acrisius has gone to Larissa. When Perseus arrives in Larissa, he participates in funeral games and accidentally strikes Acrisius on the head with a discus, killing him and fulfilling the prophecy.

===Founder of Delphic amphictyony===
According to the Scholiast on Euripides, Acrisius was the founder of the Delphic amphictyony. Strabo believes that this amphictyony existed before the time of Acrisius, and that he was only the first who regulated the affairs of the amphictyons, fixed the towns which were to take part in the council, gave to each its vote, and settled the jurisdiction of the amphictyons.

<doc id="81105" wikidata="Q657174" url="?curid=81105" title="Talos">
<text>In Greek mythology, Talos, also spelled Talus (; , &quot;Tálōs&quot;) or Talon (; , &quot;Tálōn&quot;), was a man of bronze who protected Crete from pirates and invaders. Despite the popular idea that he was a giant, no ancient source states this explicitly.

== Narrative ==
Different literary sources provide a wide variety of accounts of in relation to Talos&#x27; role and genealogy. The most popular variant of the myth of Talos is that found in the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes (fl. first half of 3rd century BCE). In this account, Talos is described as being a descendant of the bronze race (χαλκοῦ γένους) who sprang from ash-trees. He is described as being bronze and also invulnerable with the exception of a vein in his ankle which was protected by only a thin layer of skin. 

He was given to Europa by Zeus in order to protect Crete, which he does by running around the island three times. The Argonauts encounter him on their return voyage after obtaining the Golden Fleece. As the &quot;Argo&quot; approached Crete, Talos kept them at bay by hurling great boulders at the ship. Medea then declares that only she will be able to defeat Talos, which she does by performing a feat of magic from the &quot;Argo&quot;. Summoning the &quot;keres&quot; (female death-spirits), Medea causes Talos to graze his ankle, leading to the ichor draining from his body, and thus killing him. In describing his death Apollonius employs a metaphor comparing Talos to &#x27;monstrous pine tree&#x27; (πελωρίη πεύκη, &quot;pelōriē peukē&quot;) being felled, which could be taken to imply a larger-than-human size.
Pseudo-Apollodorus collected several traditions regarding the origin, form, and death of Talos. In relation to his origin, two theories are given: either he belonged to the Race of Bronze, or he had been given to Minos by Hephaestus (no reason is given). Another two theories are provided regarding his form: he was either a bull or a bronze man. Pseudo-Apollodorus further states that Talos guarded Crete by running around the island three times daily and that he had a single vein running from his neck to his ankles, which was stopped with a bronze nail at the end.

Pseudo-Apollodorus also gives three variants regarding his death. The first two are at the hands of Medea: either she drove him mad with drugs, or, promising to making him immortal, she pulled the nail from his ankle, which caused the ichor to flow out. The final variant is that he was killed by the Argonaut Poeas, who shot an arrow into his ankle.

==Artistic sources==
Artistic sources linking Talos with the Argonauts significantly predate the account of Apollonius. On three kraters from around 400 BCE, his death at the hands of the Argonauts is depicted. One red-figure vase, now in the Jatta National Archaeological Museum, is the name vase of the Talos Painter. It shows Talos falling backwards, into the arms of the Dioskouroi. In order to distinguish his form from that of the other figures on the vase, Talos is painted in white, with details painted in brown and yellow. To the left stands Medea, holding a bowl, and looking across at Talos. Behind her is the Argo, with two more seated figures, inscribed as Zetes and Calais, whilst a third, unnamed figure, disembarks. To the right, the seated figures of Poseidon and Amphitrite look on. Below them a woman, identified by some as a representation of Crete, and by others as Europa, is shown fleeing from the scene.

Another vase, from Caudium (modern Montesarchio), has been identified as depicting the death of Talos. A bearded Talos, slightly larger than the other figures, falls to the right, into the arms of the Dioskouroi. An unnamed youth kneels to the left, tightly holding an implement of some sort with which he is manipulating a small, circular object — potentially a nail — on Talos&#x27;s ankle. A woman stands behind the youth, bending down towards him. One arm is obscured, but in the other she holds a bowl. Behind her stands another unnamed woman. Suggestions as to her identity include a representation of Crete as a nymph or an attendant of Medea&#x27;s. A small, winged, and bearded figure hovers next to Talos&#x27;s ankle, gesturing closely to the site with the circular object. This figure is probably Thanatos.

A third, fragmentary vase from Spina shows the same scene, with a very similar composition to the Motesarchio vase. Talos whose head and feet have not been preserved, is depicted in white, and is falling backwards into the arms of two men, most probably the Dioskouroi. To his left a crouching female figure, mostly lost but labelled by an inscription as Medea, holds a blade in one hand and a box resting on her knee in the other. To the right of Talos&#x27;s lower leg is a small, winged, male figure, stretching his arms as if gesturing to Talos&#x27;s ankle. An unnamed female figure stands further to the right, but the head and torso are not preserved. The small figure and the unnamed female figure have sometimes been interpreted as Eros and Aphrodite but the winged figure is more probably Thanatos and the identification of Aphrodite is unlikely.

Talos also appears on three coins from Phaistos dated to the Classical and early Hellenistic periods. He is depicted as a naked winged figure in the act of throwing a stone; on one coin there is a hound between his legs. The wings have been interpreted by Richard Buxton as a visual representation of the speed which Talos would have to possess in order to rapidly circuit the island of Crete.

== Other variants ==
===Immolation of victims===

Discussing the origin of the phrase &quot;sardonios gelos&quot; (σαρδόνιος γέλως)&#x27;sardonic laugh&#x27;both Photius in his &quot;Lexicon&quot;, and Zenobius in his &quot;Proverbs&quot; cite Simonides (c. 556-468 BCE) for a story which involves Talos. Photius&#x27;s summary of the account by Simonides is that some Sardinans refused to take Talos to king Minos of Crete, in response to which Talos grabbed them and jumped into some flames whilst holding them tight, killing them. Zenobius&#x27;s summary states that Talos lived in Sardinia before going to Crete, and killed many of the inhabitants without mentioning how or why. Not enough remains to establish whether Simonides associated Talos with the Argonauts. 

Talos is also mentioned in two fragments relating to a lost Sophoclean drama, &quot;Daidalos&quot;, the plot of which in unknown. The fragments indicate that in this source, too, Talos killed his victims by burning them. Outside of Simonides and Sophocles, no other surviving source mentions this method of execution.

===Cretan lineage===

In a different tradition, Talos is the son of Cres, the personification of Crete. Hephaestus is his son, and Rhadamanthus – a mythical king of Crete – his grandson. This tradition is reported by Pausanias, who cites the poet Cinaethon of Sparta as his source. Pausanias states at another point that Talos was one of the sons of Oenopion, without giving a source. Pausanias gives no details of Talos outside of his genealogy.

According to Athenaeus, the lyric poet Ibycus wrote of Rhadamanthus as the lover of Talos, rather than grandson. The Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia from the tenth-century CE, adds to this that Talos and Rhadamanthus introduced homosexuality to Crete. 

===Rationalisation===

A euhemeristic interpretation of Talos is provided – along with many others – in the &quot;Minos&quot;, a dialogue which was attributed to Plato in antiquity, but which is regarded by most scholars today as being written by someone else. In this source, Talos is rationalised as a man who guards the laws of Crete by travelling around the villages of the island three times per year at the behest of Minos, in order to show the inhabitants the laws of the city, which were inscribed of tablets of bronze.

<text>The president of the Federative Republic of Brazil is the chief executive of the government of Brazil and commander in chief of the country&#x27;s Armed Forces. Below is a list of presidents of Brazil.

==Brazil before the Proclamation of the Republic==
Brazil had two monarchs during the time of the United Kingdom with Portugal: Maria I (1815–1816) and John VI (1816–1822). When this Kingdom was created, queen Maria I was already considered incapable due to mental illness and the Portuguese Empire was ruled by prince John, later king John VI, as regent. As an independent nation, Brazil had two monarchs, emperors Pedro I (1822–1831) and Pedro II (1831–1889). The second woman to govern Brazil, after Maria I, was Leopoldina of Austria, who acted as regent in 1822 and had a great influence on Brazil&#x27;s independence process, having been responsible for signing the decree that separated Brazil from Portugal.

Having proclaimed independence of the Kingdom of Brazil from Portugal in 1822, prince Pedro, the son of king John VI, was acclaimed the first Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822. After abdicating the throne, on 7 April 1831, he was succeeded by his son Pedro de Alcântara, who reigned as Pedro II of Brazil. The third woman to rule Brazil was princess Isabel, heir presumptive to the throne, who acted as regent of Brazil in various periods (1870–1871, 1876–1877 and 1887–1888) while her father, emperor Pedro II, performed foreign visits. During her last regency she sanctioned, on 13 May 1888, the Golden Law (Imperial Law No. 3,353), which abolished slavery in Brazil. Pedro II was deposed along with the 74-year-old monarchy on 15 November 1889 in a bloodless and unpopular military coup d&#x27;état.

==First Republic (1889–1930)==
In 1889, the Empire of Brazil was abolished and replaced with a republic in a coup d&#x27;état led by marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, who deposed emperor Pedro II, proclaimed Brazil a Republic and formed a provisional government. The 15 November 1889 military coup began as an attempt to overthrow the Empire&#x27;s prime minister, Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto, but the unprecedented coup against a prime minister appointed by the emperor and who enjoyed the confidence of the elected Chamber of Deputies quickly escalated to the abolition of the monarchy. 

With the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic, the Imperial constitution ceased to operate, the Imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) ceased to exist, and not only was the Viscount of Ouro Preto removed from office, but the position of prime minister itself ceased to exist. As head of the provisional government, Deodoro da Fonseca ruled by decree, holding both the functions of head of state and of head of government. The former provinces of the Empire were reorganized as states and the newly proclaimed republic was declared a federation, formed by the perpetual union of those states.

In 1890, elections for a Constituent Congress were summoned and held, but the decree of the provisional government that created the Congress required it to adopt a Constitution that conformed to the recently proclaimed republican system of government, and that organized the recently declared Federal State. In February 1891, a new Brazilian constitution was adopted, based on the federal republic of the United States of America. The country itself was named the Republic of the United States of Brazil. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the presidents of the Republic were to be elected by direct popular vote, but, for the first presidential term, the president and vice president would be chosen by the Constituent Congress; the Constituent Congress was to elect the first president and vice president immediately after the promulgation of the Constitution. 

In accordance with those transitional provisions, Congress elected the then head of the provisional government, Deodoro da Fonseca, as the first president of the republic. Marshal Floriano Peixoto was elected by Congress to be the first vice president. The inauguration of the first president and of the first vice president was held on 26 February 1891, only two days after the promulgation of the new Republican Constitution. Deodoro resigned the presidency ten months later after a coup d&#x27;état in which he dissolved Congress was reversed. Floriano Peixoto was then inaugurated as president. In 1894, Peixoto was succeeded by Prudente de Morais, the first president of Brazil to be elected by direct popular ballot. Morais, who was the first president to be elected under the permanent provisions of the Constitution adopted in 1891, was also the first civilian to assume the presidency of Brazil.

Although it was theoretically a constitutional democracy, the Old Republic was characterized by the power of regional oligarchies and the seldom broken alternation of power in the federal sphere between the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. The vote in the countryside was often controlled by local land owners, and less than 6% of the population had the right to vote due to literacy requirements.

In 1930, when Brazil was suffering the effects of the Wall Street crash of 1929, a revolution broke out in the country and the Old Republic ended. President Washington Luís, who was supported by São Paulo oligarchies, broke the expected alternation between São Paulo and Minas Gerais and supported a candidate who was also from São Paulo, Júlio Prestes. Prestes won the 1930 election, but Washington Luís was deposed three weeks before the end of his term and Prestes was never inaugurated.

== Vargas Era (1930–1946) ==
The Vargas Era consists of two different republics: the Second Republic, from 1930 to 1937, and the Third Republic, from 1937 to 1946.
Prior to 1929, Brazilian politics was controlled by an alliance between the two largest state economies; known as &quot;coffee with milk politics&quot;, coffee growers in São Paulo combined with the dairy industry centred in Minas Gerais to create an oligarchy, with the presidency alternating between the two states. This practice was broken when the leaders of São Paulo and president Washington Luís nominated their fellow Paulista Júlio Prestes as candidate for the presidential elections in 1930. In response, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul and Paraíba formed the &quot;Liberal Alliance&quot; backing opposition candidate Getúlio Vargas.

When Prestes won the March 1930 Presidential election, the Alliance denounced his victory as fraudulent, while Vargas&#x27;s running mate, João Pessoa, was assassinated in July. A revolution then began on 3 October 1930 and quickly spread throughout the country; by 10 October, both Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais had announced their support. Washington Luís was deposed on 24 October, and the Brazilian Military Junta of 1930 took over; Vargas assumed leadership of the junta on 3 November 1930, marking the end of the First Brazilian Republic and beginning of the Vargas Era.

The 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution led to the adoption of a new Constitution in 1934. However, the constitution was annulled and Vargas became a dictator in the name of law and order in 1937. His rule occupies two periods of Brazilian history, the Second Brazilian Republic and the Third Brazilian Republic, known as the Estado Novo.

===Second Republic (1930–1937)===
===Estado Novo (1937–1946)===

==Fourth Republic (1946–1964)==

In 1945, Vargas was deposed by a military coup led by ex-supporters. Nevertheless, he would be elected president once again and his influence in Brazilian politics would remain until the end of the Fourth republic. In this period, three parties dominated the national politics. Two were pro-Vargas – in the left, PTB and in the centre-right, PSD – and another anti-Vargas, the rightist UDN.

This period was very unstable. In 1954, Vargas committed suicide during a crisis that threatened his government and he was followed by a series of short-term presidents. In 1961, UDN won national elections for the first time, supporting Jânio Quadros, who himself was a member of a minor party allied to UDN. Quadros, who, before his election, rose meteorically in politics with an anti-corruption stance, unexpectedly resigned the presidency seven months later. Some historians suggest that Quadros was heavily drunk when he signed his resignation letter, while others suggest that Quadros felt that Congress would not accept his vice-president as president, and would ask for his return. Those historians, therefore, see Quadros&#x27; resignation as an attempt to return to office with increased powers and more political support. It is possible that both occurred: Quadros was drunk when he resigned, and in that state, he devised the plan to return to power by Congressional request. The plot failed: Congress simply received Quadros&#x27; letter, and amid the shock of politicians and of the Nation, the letter was entered into the records of Congress and the presidency was declared vacant. The president of Congress, Senator Auro de Moura Andrade, took the view that the deed of resignation was the province of the elected president, that it was not subject to a congressional vote, needing no confirmation, and that the president&#x27;s declaration of resignation was final.

At that time, the president and vice president of Brazil were voted into office separately. The vice president was a political enemy of Jânio Quadros, the leftist João Goulart. Goulart was out of the country, and Congress was controlled by right wing politicians. During Goulart&#x27;s absence, the president of the Chamber of deputies, Ranieri Mazzilli, took office as acting president of Brazil. There was then a plot to block the inauguration of the vice president as president, but Congressional resistance to the inauguration of Goulart led to a reaction by the governor of Rio Grande do Sul, who led a &quot;legality campaign&quot;, and to a split in the military (that, during the fourth Republic, intervened heavily in politics). Amid the political crisis, the solution was the adoption by Congress of a Constitutional Amendment abolishing the presidential executive and replacing it with a parliamentary system of government. Under that negotiated solution, Goulart&#x27;s inauguration was allowed to proceed, but Goulart would be head of state only, and a prime minister approved by Congress would lead the government. The new system of government&#x27;s continued existence was subject to popular approval in a referendum scheduled for 1963. The result of this referendum restored the presidential executive and a military coup deposed Goulart in 1964, starting the military dictatorship.

==Military Dictatorship (1964–1985)==

The military coup was fomented by José de Magalhães Pinto, Adhemar de Barros, and Carlos Lacerda (who had already participated in the conspiracy to depose Getúlio Vargas in 1945), then governors of the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Guanabara, respectively. The coup was planned and executed by the most forefront commanders of the Brazilian Army and received the support of almost all high-ranking members of the military, along with conservative elements in society, like the Catholic Church and anti-communist civil movements among the Brazilian middle and upper classes. Internationally, it was supported by the State Department of the United States through its embassy in Brasília.

Despite initial pledges to the contrary, the military regime enacted in 1967 a new, restrictive Constitution, and stifled freedom of speech and political opposition. The regime adopted nationalism, economic development, and anti-communism as its guidelines.

The dictatorship reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s with the so-called &quot;Brazilian Miracle&quot;, even as the regime censored all media, and tortured and exiled dissidents. João Figueiredo became president in March 1979; in the same year he passed the Amnesty Law for political crimes committed for and against the regime. While combating the &quot;hardliners&quot; inside the government and supporting a re-democratization policy, Figueiredo could not control the crumbling economy, chronic inflation and concurrent fall of other military dictatorships in South America. Amid massive popular demonstrations in the streets of the main cities of the country, the first free elections in 20 years were held for the national legislature in 1982. In 1985, another election was held, this time to elect (indirectly) a new president, being contested between civilian candidates for the first time since the 1960s, being won by the opposition. In 1988, a new Constitution was passed and Brazil officially returned to democracy. Since then, the military has remained under the control of civilian politicians, with no official role in domestic politics.

;Political parties



== Sixth Republic (1985–present) ==

In the early 1980s, the military government started a process of gradual redemocratization, called &quot;abertura&quot;, the final goal of which was democracy. When the term of the last military president was to end, however, no direct elections for President of Brazil took place. For the election of the country&#x27;s first civilian president since the military coup of 1964, the military maintained the rule that prevailed during the dictatorial regime, according to which an Electoral College made up of the entire National Congress and representatives from State Assemblies was to elect the president. This time, however, the military placed the Electoral College under no coercion, so that its members would be free to select the president of their choice. The Chamber of Deputies and the State Assemblies had been elected, already under the &quot;abertura process&quot; in the 1982 parliamentary election, but the senators were chosen indirectly, by the State Assemblies, under rules that had been passed by the military regime in 1977 to counter the growing support of the opposition: one third of the senators was chosen in 1982, and two thirds had been chosen in 1978. After the 1982 elections, the ruling party, PDS (the successor of the ARENA), still controlled a majority of the seats in the National Congress.

Tancredo Neves, who had been prime minister during the presidency of João Goulart, was chosen to be the candidate of PMDB, the major opposition party (and the successor of the MDB Party, that had opposed the Military Regime since its inception), but Tancredo was also supported by a large political spectrum, even including a significant part of former members of ARENA, the party that supported the military presidents. In the last months of the military regime, a large section of ARENA members defected from the party, and now professed to be men of democratic inclinations. They formed the Liberal Front, and the Liberal Front Party allied itself to PMDB, forming a coalition known as the Democratic Alliance. PMDB needed the Liberal Front&#x27;s support in order to secure victory in the Electoral College. In the formation of this broad coalition former members of ARENA also switched parties and joined PMDB. So, to seal this arrangement, the spot of vice-president in Tancredo Neves&#x27; ticket was given to José Sarney, who represented the former supporters of the regime that had now joined the Democratic Alliance. On the other hand, those who remained loyal to the military regime and its legacy renamed ARENA as the PDS. In the PDS&#x27;s National Convention, two right-wing supporters of the military administrations fought for the party&#x27;s nomination: Colonel Mário Andreazza, then Minister of the Interior in General Figueiredo&#x27;s administration, was the preferred candidate of the incumbent president and of the military elite, but he was defeated by Paulo Maluf, a civilian and former governor of São Paulo State during the military regime. Tancredo&#x27;s coalition defeated Maluf, and his election was hailed as the dawn of a New Republic. Andreazza&#x27;s defeat (by 493 votes to 350) and the selection of Maluf as the PDS&#x27;s presidential candidate greatly contributed to the split in the party that led to the formation of the Liberal Front. The Liberal Front refused to support Maluf and joined forces with the PMDB in supporting Tancredo Neves, thus forging the Democratic Alliance. Without that split in the PDS, the election of the opposition candidate would not have been possible.

Although elected President of Brazil, Tancredo Neves became gravely ill on the eve of his inauguration and died without ever taking office. Therefore, the first civilian president since 1964 was Tancredo&#x27;s running mate, José Sarney, himself an ex-member of ARENA. José Sarney&#x27;s administration fulfilled Tancredo&#x27;s campaign promise of passing a constitutional amendment to the Constitution inherited from the military regime, so as to summon elections for a National Constituent Assembly with full powers to draft and adopt a new Constitution for the country, to replace the authoritarian legislation that still remained in place. In October 1988, a new democratic Constitution was passed and democracy was consolidated. In 1989, the first elections for president under the new Constitution were held and the young Fernando Collor de Mello was elected for a five-year term, the first president to be elected by direct popular ballot since the military coup. He was inaugurated in 1990 and in 1992 he became the first president in Brazil to be impeached due to corruption. However, he resigned before the final verdict.

A referendum held in 1993 (ahead of the 1993 and 1994 Constitutional Revision) allowed the people to decide the form of government of the state (monarchy or republic) for the first time since the proclamation of the Republic in 1889; the republican form of government prevailed. In the same referendum, the Brazilian people was able to choose again, for the first time since 1963, the system of Government (parliamentary or presidential) and the model of a presidential executive was retained. The revision was a unique opportunity to amend the Constitution with a reduced majority. Had a different form or system of government been chosen in the 1993 referendum, the new institutional structure would have been implemented during the Constitutional Revision. Both the Revision and the referendum on the form and system of government were summoned in the original text of the Constitution. The federal model of the state, retained in the 1988 Constitution, is declared by the Constitution as not subject to abolition, even by Constitutional Amendment. According to those tenets and to the results of the popular vote, only minor changes were made to the institutional framework of the State in the Constitutional Revision, including the adoption of a Constitutional Amendment that reduced the presidential term of office from five to four years.

In 1995, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was inaugurated for a four-year term. In 1997, a Constitutional Amendment was enacted allowing presidents of Brazil to be reelected to one consecutive term. In 1998, then President Fernando Henrique Cardoso became the first president of Brazil to be reelected for an immediately consecutive term. In 2003, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was inaugurated. He was reelected in 2006. In 2011, Dilma Rousseff became Brazil&#x27;s first woman president. In 2015, she began her second term, but in 2016 the Senate of Brazil convicted her on impeachment charges, and she was removed from office, being succeeded by Michel Temer. In 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected, taking office on 1 January 2019. In the 2022 elections, former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who had served as Brazil&#x27;s president from 2003 to 2010, was again elected president, becoming the first person to win three Brazilian presidential elections. Also in the 2022 elections, Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil&#x27;s first first-term President to seek reelection for a second term and lose, since the possibility of reelection to an immediately consecutive second term was first created in Brazil in 1997.

<doc id="81107" wikidata="Q610968" url="?curid=81107" title="Mario Bros.">
<text>is a 1983 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for arcades. It was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, Nintendo&#x27;s chief engineer. Italian twin brother plumbers Mario and Luigi exterminate turtle-like creatures and crabs emerging from the sewers by knocking them upside-down and kicking them away. The Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System version is the first game to be developed by Intelligent Systems. It is part of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, but originally began as a spin-off from the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series.

The arcade, Famicom, and Nintendo Entertainment System versions were received positively by critics. Elements introduced in &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, such as spinning bonus coins, turtles that can be flipped onto their backs, and Luigi, were carried over to &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1985) and became staples of the series.

An updated version, titled &quot;Mario Bros. Classic&quot;, is included as a minigame in all of the &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; series and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot; (2003). The NES version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; had been re-released through the Wii and Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console as well as Nintendo Switch Online; the original arcade version was released by Hamster Corporation on the Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Mario Bros.&quot; features two plumbers, Italian brothers Mario and Luigi, having to investigate the sewers after strange creatures have been appearing down there. The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase. The mechanics of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; involve only running and jumping. Unlike future &quot;Mario&quot; games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back. Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen, along with an object called a &quot;POW&quot; block in the center. Phases use wraparound, meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side. Points are scored for defeating enemies and collecting the bonus coins that emerge from the pipes afterward.

Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this the enemy will flip itself back over and recover.

There are four enemies which emerge from the pipes:
the Shellcreeper; the Sidestepper; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice which turns platforms into slippery ice. A fifth enemy, fireballs, floats around the screen instead of sticking to platforms. The &quot;POW&quot; block will flip all enemies touching a platform or the floor when activated, but can only be used three times before disappearing. The game additionally contains bonus rounds. In later rounds, icicles begin to form on the underside of the platforms and fall off.

One life is lost whenever the player touches an un-flipped enemy, fireball, or fully formed icicle. The game ends when all lives are lost.

==Development==
&quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead developers for the video game &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. In &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, Mario dies if he falls too far. For &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;, Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that Mario should be able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that it would make it &quot;not much of a game&quot;. He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario &quot;jumping and bouncing around&quot;, which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors, but it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they&#x27;ve been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below. Because of Mario&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; with overalls, a hat, and a thick moustache, Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter, and designed this game to reflect that. Another contributing factor was the game&#x27;s setting: it was a large network of giant pipes, so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him. The game&#x27;s music was composed by Yukio Kaneoka.

A popular story of how Mario went from Jumpman to Mario is that an Italian American landlord, Mario Segale, had barged in on Nintendo of America (NOA)&#x27;s staff to demand rent, and they decided to name Jumpman after him. This story is contradicted by former NOA warehouse manager Don James, who has stated that he and then-NOA president Minoru Arakawa named the character after Segale as a joke because Segale was so reclusive that none of the employees had ever met him. Miyamoto also felt that the best setting for this game was New York due to its labyrinthine subterranean network of sewage pipes. The pipes were inspired by several manga, which Miyamoto states feature waste grounds with pipes lying around. In this game, they were used in a way to allow the enemies to enter and exit the stage through them to avoid getting enemies piled up on the bottom of the stage. The green coloring of the pipes, which Nintendo late president Satoru Iwata called an uncommon color, came from Miyamoto having a limited color palette and wanting to keep things colorful. He added that green was the best because it worked well when two shades of it were combined.

&quot;Mario Bros.&quot; introduced Mario&#x27;s brother, Luigi, who was created for the multiplayer mode by doing a palette swap of Mario. The two-player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by &quot;Joust&quot;. To date, &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; has been released for more than a dozen platforms. The first movement from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; is used at the start of the game. This song has been used in later video games, including &quot;Dance Dance Revolution: Mario Mix&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;.

==Release==
The arcade game was released in 1983, but there are conflicting release dates. &quot;Game Machine&quot; magazine reported that the game made its North American debut at the AMOA show during March 25–27 and entered mass-production in Japan on June 21. The book &quot;Arcade TV Game List&quot; (2006), authored by Masumi Akagi and published by the Amusement News Agency, lists the release dates as March 1983 in North America and June 1983 in Japan. Former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said in a 2013 &quot;Nintendo Direct&quot; presentation that the game was first released in Japan on July 6, 1983.

Upon release, &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was initially labeled as being the third game in the &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; series. For home video game conversions, Nintendo held the rights to the game in Japan, while licensing the overseas rights to Atari, Inc.

==Ports and other versions==
&quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was ported by other companies to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 7800, Amstrad CPC, and ZX Spectrum. The Commodore 64 has two versions: an Atarisoft port which was not commercially released and a 1986 version by Ocean Software. The Atari 8-bit computer version by Sculptured Software is the only home port which includes the falling icicles. An Apple II version was never commercially released, but copies of it appear to exist.

A port by Nintendo and Intelligent Systems for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was released in North America in June 1986. Another NES port was released in August 1993 exclusively in Germany as part of the Classic Series.

A port for NEC&#x27;s PC-8001, unrelated to the Hudson Soft-developed &quot;Mario Bros. Special&quot; and &quot;Punch Ball Mario Bros.&quot;, was developed by MISA and published by Westside Soft House in 1984.

A modified version titled was released only in Japan on November 30, 1988, for the Famicom Disk System through the Disk Writer service. 

In Taiwan and Mainland China, the game is sometimes nicknamed as &quot;Pipeline&quot; (管道) or &quot;Mr. Mary&quot; (瑪莉) due to the fact that pirated copies of this game were distributed widely, and pirate companies could not use the real name of the game and characters to bypass copyright.

The NES version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was ported via the Virtual Console service in North America, Australia, Europe and Japan for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U. The original arcade version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was released in September 2017 for the Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series. The NES version was a launch title for Nintendo Switch Online.

Nintendo included &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; as a bonus in a number of releases, including &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; in the form of a two-player minigame, and as a single-player mode in the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; series as well as &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot;. The NES version is included as a piece of furniture in &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; for the GameCube, along with many other NES games, though this one requires the use of a Nintendo e-Reader and a North America-exclusive &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; e-Card.

In 2004, Namco released an arcade cabinet containing &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Jr.&quot; and &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; The latter was altered for the vertical screen used by the other games, with the visible play area cropped on the sides.

==Reception==
&quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was initially a modest success in arcades, with an estimated 2,000 arcade cabinets sold in the United States by July 1983. It went on to be highly successful in American arcades. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; on their July 15, 1983, issue as being the third most-successful new table arcade unit of the month. In the United States, Nintendo sold 3,800 &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; arcade cabinets. The arcade cabinets have since become mildly rare and hard to find. Despite being released during the video game crash of 1983, the arcade game was not affected. Video game author Dave Ellis considers it one of the more memorable classic games. To date in Japan, the Famicom version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; has sold more than 1.63 million copies, and the &quot;Famicom Mini&quot; re-release has sold more than 90,000 copies. The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) version went on to sell 2.28 million cartridges worldwide. The Atari 2600 version also sold 1.59 million cartridges, making it one of the bestselling games of 1983. This brings total Atari 2600, NES and &quot;Famicom Mini&quot; cartridge sales to units sold worldwide.

The NES and Atari versions of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; received positive reviews from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; in 1989. They said the NES version is &quot;incredibly good fun&quot; especially in two-player mode, the Atari VCS version is &quot;just as much fun&quot; but with graphical restrictions, and the Atari 7800 version is slightly better.

The 2009 Virtual Console re-release of the NES version later received mixed reviews, but received positive reviews from gamers. In a review of the Virtual Console release, &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the NES version for being a poor port of the arcade version and that retains all of the technical flaws found in this version. &quot;IGN&quot; complimented the Virtual Console version&#x27;s gameplay, even though it was critical of Nintendo&#x27;s decision to release an &quot;inferior&quot; NES port on the Virtual Console. &quot;IGN&quot; also agreed on the issue of the number of ports. They said that since most people have &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; on one of the &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; games, this version is not worth 500 Wii Points. The Nintendo e-Reader version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was slightly more well received by &quot;IGN&quot;, who praised the gameplay, but criticized it for lack of multiplayer and for not being worth the purchase because of the &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; versions.

The &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; releases and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot; all featured the same version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; (titled &quot;Mario Bros. Classic&quot;). The mode was first included in &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot;, and was praised for its simplicity and entertainment value. &quot;IGN&quot; called this mode fun in its review of &quot;Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2&quot;, but complained that it would have been nice if the developers had come up with a new game to replace it. Their review of &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island: Super Mario Advance 3&quot; criticizes it more so than in the review of &quot;Super Mario Advance 2&quot; because Nintendo chose not to add multiplayer to any of the mini-games found in that game, sticking instead with an identical version of the &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; game found in previous versions. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s review of &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; calls it a throwaway feature that could have simply been gutted. Other reviewers were not as negative on the feature&#x27;s use in later &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; games. Despite its use being criticized in most &quot;Super Mario Advance&quot; games, a &quot;GameSpy&quot; review called the version found in &quot;Super Mario Advance 2&quot; a blast to play in multi-player because it only requires at least two Game Boy Advances, one copy of the game, and a link cable.

===Related games===
In 1984, Hudson Soft made two different games based on &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; is a reimagining with new phases and gameplay. includes a new gameplay mechanic: punching small balls to stun enemies. Both games were released for the PC-6001mkII, PC-8001mkII, PC-8801, FM-7 and Sharp X1.

A version of the game was announced alongside the Virtual Boy hardware itself at Nintendo Space World 1994. Footage demonstrated showed a faithful recreation of the game, albeit with the Virtual Boy&#x27;s trademark graphical qualities of monochrome red and black graphics and a slight stereoscopic 3D effect. Its demonstration was generally poorly received by video game publications, which lamented the selection of a decade-old game to demonstrate the technology of the new Virtual Boy hardware. &quot;Mario Bros. VB&quot;, as demonstrated, was never released, but some gameplay concepts were utilized in &quot;Mario Clash&quot; (1995), a much more creative reimagining of the original &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;

&quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; for the Wii U contains a version of &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; starring Luigi: &quot;Luigi Bros&quot;. This version, based on the NES port and included as a part of the Year of Luigi celebrations, replaced Mario with Luigi in his modern color scheme; the second player&#x27;s sprite retains the original Luigi colors.

===High score===
On October 16, 2015, Steve Kleisath obtained the world record for the arcade version at 5,424,920 points verified by Twin Galaxies.

<text>In Greek mythology, Oeagrus () was a king of Thrace, and father of Orpheus.

== Biography ==

=== Kingdom ===
There are various versions as to where Oeagrus&#x27; domain was actually situated. In one version, he ruled over the Edonian kingdom in the region of Mygdonia. He is also connected with Pieria, further west, or to the vicinity of the River Hebrus to the east, the latter was said to be called &#x27;Oeagria&#x27;, in his honor.

=== Family ===
In the version that places Oeagrus in Pieria, his father is given as King Pierus and the nymph Methone. He was described as &quot;a Thracian wine-god, who was himself descended from Atlas.&quot; According to &quot;Suda&quot;, Oiagros was in the fifth generation after Atlas, by Alkyone, one of his daughters. This can be explained by the following genealogy: (1) Atlas by Pleione — (2) Alcyone by Poseidon — (3) Aethusa by Apollo — (4) Linus or Eleuther — (5) Pierus by Methone — Oeager. This was supported by the order of genealogy according to the historian Charax which as follows: Aethuse the Thracian was the mother of Linus, the father of Pierus, the father of Oeagrus.

In the account that places him in Edonia he is said to be the son of Charops, an adherent of the god Dionysus; Charops was invited by Dionysus to rule over the Edones after the violent death of their king Lycurgus. Oeagrus has also sometimes been called the son of the god Ares, who was associated with Thrace.

Oeagrus and the Muse Calliope or Clio or Polymnia were the parents of Orpheus and Linus. He married Calliope close to Pimpleia, Olympus. The sisters of Orpheus are called Oeagrides, in the sense of the Muses. The father of Orpheus was sometimes given as Apollo. Oeagrus was also mentioned as the father of Marsyas.
== Mythology ==
In Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca,&quot; the author states that Oeagrus quitted his city of Pimpleia on the Bistonian plain and followed the enterprise of Dionysos against the Indian people. He left his newly born son Orpheus in the charge of his consort Calliopeia. 

Oeagrus was also described as a singer and harpist, and a skilled warrior during this adventures.
==Honours==
Oeagrus Beach in Antarctica is named after the mythical king.

<doc id="81110" wikidata="Q7530179" url="?curid=81110" title="Sirenum Scopuli">
<text>According to the Roman poets Virgil (&quot;Aeneid&quot;, 5.864) and Ovid, the Sirenum Scopuli were three small rocky islands where the sirens of Greek mythology lived and lured sailors to their deaths. &quot;The Sirenum Scopuli are sharp rocks that stand about a stone&#x27;s throw from the south side of the island&quot; of Capri, was Joseph Addison&#x27;s confident identification.

Diverse locations were assigned to the isles of the sirens by various authorities. According to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, they were between Aeaea and the rock of Scylla. Often they have been placed in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the coast of south-western Italy near Paestum or between Sorrento and Capri: &quot;three small islands on the southwest coast of Campania, now Licosa, St. Pietro and La Galetta&quot;, reported George Richard Crooks and Christian Frederik Ingersley on the basis of Alexander Jacob Schem, &quot;A New Latin-English School-Lexicon&quot; (Philadelphia), 1861 &quot;s.v.&quot; &quot;Siren&quot;.

Similarly, Anthemoessa (or Anthemusa) was the island home of the sirens in other versions of the myth. Although the name no longer exists, varying accounts attribute Anthemoessa to the island of Ischia or Capri, in the Gulf of Naples.

Further traditions place the sirens on Capo Peloro or the Sirenuse islands, near Paestum.

All locations were described to be surrounded by cliffs and rocks.

<text>Super Mario Bros. 3 is a 1988 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was released for home consoles in Japan on October 23, 1988, in North America on February 12, 1990, and in Europe on August 29, 1991. It was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, led by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka.

Players control brothers Mario or Luigi, who must save Princess Toadstool and the rulers of seven different kingdoms from the antagonist Bowser. As in previous Mario games, they defeat enemies by stomping on them or using items that bestow magical powers; they also have new abilities, including flight and sliding down slopes. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; introduced many elements that became &quot;Super Mario&quot; staples, such as Bowser&#x27;s children (the Koopalings) and a world map to transition between levels.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was praised by critics for its challenging gameplay and is regarded as one of the greatest video games of all time. It is the third-best-selling NES game, with more than 17 million copies sold worldwide. It also inspired an animated television series, produced by DIC Entertainment.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was remade for the Super NES as a part of &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot; in 1993 and for the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; in 2003. It was rereleased on the Virtual Console service on the Wii U and 3DS, and was included on the NES Classic Mini. On September 19, 2018, it was rereleased on the Nintendo Switch Online service with added netplay.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls either Mario or Luigi. The game shares similar gameplay mechanics with previous games in the series &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; while introducing several new elements. In addition to the running and jumping found in previous games, the player character can slide down slopes, pick up and throw certain items, and freely climb vines. New power-ups are introduced, including the Super Leaf and the Tanooki Suit, which allow Mario to fly and float. The game world consists of eight kingdoms, each subdivided into multiple levels. The eight worlds feature distinct visual themes: the first world is grass and the second world, &quot;Desert Land&quot; (or &quot;Desert Hill&quot; in Japanese and North American PRG0 versions), contains sand-covered levels with pyramids, while the levels in the fourth world, &quot;Giant Land&quot; (&quot;Big Island&quot;), contain obstacles and enemies twice their normal height and width.

The player navigates through the game via two game screens: an overworld map and a course. The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current kingdom and has several paths leading from the world&#x27;s entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, and other map icons, and allow players to take different routes to reach the kingdom&#x27;s goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or fortress will allow access to that course, a linear stage populated with obstacles and enemies. The majority of the game takes place in these levels, with the player traversing the stage by dashing, jumping, flying, swimming, and dodging or defeating enemies. Players start with a certain number of lives and may gain additional lives by picking up green spotted 1-Up mushrooms hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, among other methods. Mario and Luigi lose a life if they take damage while small, fall into lava or a bottomless pit, or run out of time. The game ends prematurely when all lives are lost, although the player can continue from the beginning of the world they lost their last life in by selecting &quot;Continue&quot;. If the player chooses to continue, all fortresses and enemy courses, as well as the tank and ship levels from the eighth world that the player previously completed will remain completed and any locked doors that were unlocked will also remain unlocked. This allows the player to continue from the last fortress level they completed in most cases. The player will also be able to keep all of their items in their inventory.

Completing stages allows the player to progress through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat. The first seven worlds feature an airship controlled by one of the Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world as the Final Boss. Other map icons include large boulders and locked doors that impede paths. Mini-games and bonus screens on the map provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve, and can be activated by the player from the map screen.

In addition to special items from previous games like the Super Mushroom, Super Star, and the Fire Flower, new power-ups are introduced that provide the player with new options. The Super Leaf and Tanooki Suit give Mario raccoon and tanooki appearances respectively, allowing him to fly for a short period of time. The Tanooki Suit also enables him to turn into Statue Mario to avoid enemies for a short period of time. Changing into a Tanooki statue while jumping results in Mario pounding the ground and killing whatever enemies are directly under him; this is the first appearance of the now standard &quot;ground pound&quot; move in the &quot;Mario&quot; series. The new &quot;Frog Suit&quot; highly increases the character&#x27;s underwater speed and agility, and boosts jumping height on land. Another new suit, the Hammer Suit, gives Mario the appearance of the Hammer Bro. enemy and allows him to throw hammers at enemies and resist fire attacks when crouching.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to play the game by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels. The first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; arcade game, in which one player has the opportunity to steal the cards of another, but may lose their turn if they lose the mini-game.

== Plot and characters ==
The plot of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; is described in the instruction booklet. In the Mushroom World, Bowser has his seven children, the Koopalings, conquer each of the seven kingdoms by stealing its king&#x27;s magical wand and using it to transform him into an animal. Princess Toadstool receives news of Bowser&#x27;s actions and dispatches Mario and Luigi to travel to each kingdom, retrieve the stolen wand, and restore its king to normal.

Mario and Luigi receive notes and special items from Toadstool after rescuing each of the first six kings. When they rescue the seventh king, they instead receive a note from Bowser, boasting that he has kidnapped Toadstool and imprisoned her within the castle of his own realm, Dark Land. The brothers travel through Dark Land, enter his castle, and defeat Bowser in a battle. The game ends with Princess Toadstool being freed from the castle.

According to Shigeru Miyamoto, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was conceived as a stage play. The title screen features a stage curtain being drawn open, and in the original NES version, in-game objects hang from off-screen catwalks, are bolted to the background, or cast shadows on the skyline. When Mario finishes a level, he walks off the stage.

== Development and release ==
Beginning development shortly after the 1986 release of the Famicom Disk System&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, a team that consisted of more than ten people. The game took more than two years to complete. The development budget, when converted to US dollars, amounts to about $800,000 to ( adjusted for inflation). Developer Shigeru Miyamoto served as director. He worked closely with the designers and programmers during the conceptual and final stages, encouraging a free interchange of ideas. Miyamoto considered intriguing and original ideas to be key to creating a successful game. Originally, the team intended for the game to be played from an isometric point of view, but the developers found that this made it too difficult to position jumps, so the game was changed to the 2D side view used in previous games. Some isometric elements remain, such as the checkered floor present in the title screen. All pixel art for the game was drawn using Fujitsu FM R-50 HD business computers while HP 64000 mainframe computers with a 6502 processor card were used to write and test code.

The game was designed to appeal to players of varying skill levels. To assist less-to no skill players, bonus coins and 1-ups are more abundant in earlier worlds, while later worlds present more complex challenges for experienced players. In the two-player mode, the players alternate turns to balance play time. The development team introduced new power-ups and concepts that would give Mario the appearance of different creatures as a means of providing him with new abilities. An early idea changed Mario into a centaur, but was dropped in favor of a raccoon tail with limited flying ability. Other costumes with different abilities were added to his repertoire, and levels were designed to take advantage of these abilities. New enemies were included to add diversity to the game, along with variants of previous enemies, such as Goombas, Hammer Bros., and Koopa Troopas.

Some of the enemies designed for &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; were inspired by the team&#x27;s personal experiences. For example, the Chain Chomp enemy, a barking tethered ball and chain creature with eyes and teeth that lunges at the player when in close proximity, was drawn from Miyamoto&#x27;s early life, in which a dog lunged at him, but was pulled away from him. Bowser&#x27;s children, the Koopalings, were designed to be unique in appearance and personality; Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work and efforts. Nintendo of America named the Koopalings after well-known musicians: for example, the characters &quot;Ludwig von Koopa&quot; and &quot;Roy Koopa&quot; are named after Ludwig van Beethoven and Roy Orbison respectively.

The character graphics were created with a special graphics machine (&quot;Character Generator Computer Aided Design&quot;) that generated a collection of the graphical shapes used in the game. Shapes in the collection were assigned numbers that the game&#x27;s code used to access and combine to form complete images on the screen in real time. The &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; cartridge uses Nintendo&#x27;s custom MMC3 ASIC to enhance the NES capabilities. The MMC3 chip allows for animated tiles, extra RAM for diagonal scrolling, and a scan line timer to split the screen. The game uses these functions to split the game screen into two portions, a playfield on the top and a status bar on the bottom. On the overworld map, the status bar doubles as an inventory for items and power-ups. This allows the top portion to scroll as the character navigates the stage while the bottom portion remains static to display text and other information.

Like its predecessors, the music in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was composed by Koji Kondo, who composed several new songs as well as returning melodies from &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; According to Kondo, who had composed the music in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; based on what he believed fit the levels rather than focusing on composing a specific genre of music, the game was the most difficult game for him to compose. Kondo experimented with several different genres of music, unsure of how to follow up the music from the first game after hearing from several people that it sounded a lot like Latin or fusion music, and came up with several different melodies throughout its development before settling on what ultimately made it into the game. The development team decided that music on the title screen was unnecessary.

During 1988, a shortage of ROM chips, along with Nintendo&#x27;s preparation of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, prevented Nintendo from performing various North American game releases according to their original schedules. The delayed products included &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; and, according to &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;. The delay, however, presented Nintendo with an opportunity to promote the game in a feature film. In 1989, Tom Pollack of Universal Studios approached Nintendo of America&#x27;s marketing department about a video game movie; inspired by Nintendo video game competitions, Pollack envisioned a video game version of &quot;Tommy&quot; for younger audiences. Nintendo licensed its products for inclusion in what would become the film &quot;The Wizard&quot;. During the movie&#x27;s production, the filmmakers requested and were granted approval from Nintendo regarding the script and the portrayal of the company&#x27;s games. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was one of the products shown in the film and was used in a final scene involving a video game competition. The film was released in December 1989, between the home console releases of the game in Japan and North America.

The marketing budget for &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was , bringing the game&#x27;s total development and marketing budget to ( adjusted for inflation).

== Reception ==
&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was lauded by the video game press. It is frequently considered the best game released on the NES. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; editors Paul Rand, Tim Boone and Frank O&#x27;Connor awarded the game a 98% score, praising it for its gameplay, replayability, sound, and graphics. Boone commented that the game is nearly flawless in its utterly &quot;stupendous incredibility and absolutely impossible to put down for anything less than a fire alarm and even then you find yourself weighing down the odds.&quot; Rand called &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; the best video game ever, labeling it &quot;the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; of gaming&quot; and stating that it is &quot;astoundingly brilliant in every way, shape, and form.&quot; O&#x27;Connor stated that the game &quot;makes &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; look like a wet Sunday morning and even gives the Super Famicom&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario World&quot; a run for its money.&quot;

The Japanese publication &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a 35 out of 40. Julian Rignall of &quot;Mean Machines&quot; referred to &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; as the &quot;finest video game&quot; he had ever played, citing its addictiveness, depth, and challenge. A second &quot;Mean Machines&quot; reviewer, Matt Regan, anticipated the game would be a bestseller in the United Kingdom, and echoed Rignall&#x27;s praise, calling it a &quot;truly brilliant game&quot;. Regan further stated that the game offered elements which tested the player&#x27;s &quot;brains and reflexes&quot;, and that though the graphics were simple, they were &quot;incredibly varied&quot;. In a preview of the game, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave it high marks in graphics, audio, challenge, gameplay, and enjoyability. The items hidden in the game&#x27;s levels, such as the warp whistles, were well-received: Rignall regarded them as part of the game&#x27;s addictiveness, and Sheff stated that finding them provided a sense of satisfaction.

Criticism focused on particular aspects of the game. Rignall described the audio and visuals as being outdated in comparison to games on the Mega Drive/Genesis and Super NES (the latter platform having already been launched in other regions by the time &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was released in Europe).

=== Sales ===
&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; became a best-selling game. In Japan, it appeared at the top of the &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales charts in December 1988 and January 1989, and became the second best-selling game of 1988 after &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. By mid-1989, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; had become the second best-selling game in Japan (non-bundled) up until then, after &quot;Dragon Quest III&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; went on to become the overall best-selling game of 1989 in Japan, just above &quot;Tetris&quot; in second place. It also topped the Japanese sales chart in January 1990. By 1993, it had sold cartridges in Japan.

In North America, the inclusion of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; in &quot;The Wizard&quot; served as a preview which generated a high level of anticipation in the United States prior to its release. Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot; considered the game&#x27;s appearance in the film as a show-stealing element, referring to the movie as a &quot;90-minute commercial&quot; for the game. The game sold 250,000 copies in its first two days of release, according to a spokeswoman for Nintendo. It remained the top-selling game in the United States through April and June to September 1990. In 1990, the game sold more than units. By 1993, author David Sheff said the game had sold 11 million unbundled units in Japan and the United States, commenting that, in music industry terms, the game went platinum 11 times. In the United States alone, the game had generated in revenue for Nintendo by early 1992, exceeding the gross revenue of the films &quot;E.T.&quot; (1982), &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (1993). The game was also a hit in other regions such as Europe and Singapore.

The game had sold copies by 1995, and copies by 1998. By 2000, the game had sold more than 17 million copies worldwide, and held the record for the best-selling non-bundled video game for a long time. As of 2011, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was the highest-grossing non-bundled home video game up until then, with a 2011 inflation-adjusted revenue of . In 2013, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; reported that the game had sold more than copies for the NES. &quot;Game Informer&quot; also reported in their October 2009 issue that the Virtual Console version had sold one million copies.

=== Awards ===
In &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; (&quot;Famitsu&quot;) magazine&#x27;s 1988 Best Hit Game Awards, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; won the Best Action Game award. In 1989, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it the award for best action game released since 1983.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; has received universal acclaim from modern critics who consider it one of the best games of all time, and has appeared on many top games lists. The game debuted on &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 30 best games ever list at number 20 in September 1989. It entered the list&#x27;s top 10 a few months later and reached number one in May 1990. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; remained within the top 20 for more than five years. More than a decade later, the magazine ranked the game number six on their list of 200 Greatest Nintendo Games. In August 2008, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; listed &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; as the second best NES video game, praising it for making the series more complex and introducing new abilities that have since become signature abilities in the series. The game placed 11th, behind &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s &quot;100 greatest Nintendo games of all time&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; considered &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; Nintendo&#x27;s standout game of 1989, and commented that its success outshone the first &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;″s sales milestone; the first game sold 40 million copies, but was bundled with the NES. They lauded the overworld map as an elegant alternative to a menu to select levels. In 2007, &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; called &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; the best &quot;Mario&quot; game in the series as well as the best game on the NES, citing the graphics, power-ups, secrets, and popularity, summing it up as &quot;just incredible&quot; and stating, &quot;If you haven&#x27;t experienced this greatness, we pity you&quot;. In a poll conducted by &quot;Dengeki&quot;, the game tied with &quot;Super Mario World&quot; as the number three video game their readers first played. GamesRadar also called it the best NES game, saying that while &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; defined its genre, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; perfected it. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; rated the NES version 99th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked the All-Stars edition the 2nd best console game of all time (behind only &quot;Tetris&quot;), saying it &quot;took the series back to its roots, but expanded upon the original game in every way imaginable. No other game since has been able to recapture the spirit of adventure and enchantment found in Mario 3.&quot; The game has been ranked on several of &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s lists of &quot;top games&quot;. In 2005, they rated it 23rd among their Top 100 Games, and praised the precise and intuitive controls. &quot;IGN&quot; editors from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia ranked &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; number 39 in their 2007 Top 100 Games, citing Miyamoto&#x27;s &quot;ingenious&quot; designs. They further commented that the game improved on the &quot;already-brilliant concepts&quot; of the previous games with new power-ups and enemies. Users and readers of the website placed the game high on similar lists: 32nd in 2005 and 21st in 2006. In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; put &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; 9th on their list of &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that it is &quot;a game with incredible lasting power that we won&#x27;t soon forget&quot;. This is down one place from &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s previous ranking in 2001. &quot;Edge&quot; ranked the game #20 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Games To Play Today&quot;, calling it &quot;the one 8-bit game that still shines today, no caveats required.&quot; &quot;UGO&quot; listed &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Games That Belong On the 3DS&quot;, calling it &quot;Arguably the greatest Mario game ever made.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; placed the game on their list of the greatest games of all time. &quot;USgamer&quot; ranked the game as the third best &quot;Mario&quot; platformer ever. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; ranked 34th on Warp Zoned&#x27;s &quot;Scientifically Proven Best Video Games of All Time&quot; list, a statistical meta-analysis of 44 &quot;top games&quot; lists published between 1995 and 2016.

== Rereleases and remakes ==

The NES version of the game has been ported to several other Nintendo consoles. It was rereleased in emulation as a downloadable Virtual Console game in 2007 for the Wii and in 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U consoles. It is one of thirty pre-installed games in the NES Classic Edition console, and is on the Nintendo Switch Online service.

&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was included in the 1993 SNES game &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;, a compilation of remakes of NES &quot;Super Mario&quot; games featuring updated graphics and sound, which was also later released on the Wii in 2010 and the Nintendo Switch Online service in 2020.
&quot;Super Mario 3 Special,&quot; an unofficial bootleg port for the Game Boy Color, was released in 2000. This version was developed in Hong Kong and is truncated to only five levels. Former &quot;1Up.com&quot; journalist Ray Barnholt panned &quot;Super Mario 3 Special&quot; as a &quot;horrible, awful, rank piece of software.&quot; Barnholt criticized its extremely short length, &quot;atrocious&quot; controls leading him to liken Mario&#x27;s movement to &quot;a drunken Sonic,&quot; poor level design, coloring, and music, and lack of a proper ending.

A Game Boy Advance version, &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, was released in 2003. In addition to the visual and sound changes from &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;, this version also includes support for the Nintendo e-Reader peripheral, which allows the player to access new levels and power-ups stored on e-Reader cards.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; introduced several elements carried over to subsequent &quot;Mario&quot; games. A similar overworld map is used in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. DX&quot; and &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot;, and Mario&#x27;s ability to fly has been a feature in games such as &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;. The game&#x27;s &quot;Super Leaf&quot; item has returned in more recent &quot;Mario&quot; games for the Nintendo 3DS, like &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot; and &quot;New Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;. Bowser&#x27;s red hair was first popularized in the game and has since become a part of his standard appearance.

Through a collaboration between NBC and Nintendo of America, an animated television series, &quot;The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3,&quot; was created from September to December 1990 by DIC Entertainment. The show aired weekly on Saturday mornings on NBC alongside the second season of &quot;Captain N: The Game Master&quot; as part of the hour-long &quot;Captain N &amp; The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; programming block with 26 episodes and featured numerous characters, enemies, and settings from the video game; the original seven Koopalings are given different names based on their given personalities and are also given a new age order. Other Nintendo products have included various elements of the game as well. Music from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; appears as a track on &quot;Nintendo Sound Selection Koopa&quot;, a collection of songs from Nintendo games. The game&#x27;s stages and graphics comprise a background theme in the 2006 Nintendo DS game &quot;Tetris DS&quot;. The Koopalings are also world bosses in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Safari&quot;, &quot;Hotel Mario&quot; and all &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; games except &quot;New Super Mario Bros.&quot; Boom Boom, another boss from this game, additionally reappears in &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot;, alongside a boomerang-wielding female counterpart named Pom Pom. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; is one of the games represented as themes in both &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Maker 2&quot;.

In the early 1990s, game developers John Carmack and Tom Hall developed an IBM PC clone of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; based on their innovative adaptive tile refresh software that performs smooth, side-scrolling graphics on EGA cards. They demonstrated it to Nintendo leaders, who were impressed with the demo but rejected cloning in favor of exclusivity. Carmack and Hall went on to found id Software and develop &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, a series of platform games inspired by &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3.&quot; The &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; demo had not been readily shared, but a working copy was discovered and preserved in the Museum of Play in July 2021.

In April 1993, &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot; (&quot;Famitsu&quot;) magazine awarded &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; a world record for having the most strategy guide books published, with 20 strategy books published for the game up until then.

At the 2007 Game Developers Conference, Stanford University curator Henry Lowood, along with game designers Warren Spector and Steve Meretzky, academic researcher Matteo Bittanti and game journalist Christopher Grant named &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; one of the 10 most important video games of all time, being a member of a &quot;game canon&quot; whose inductees were submitted to the Library of Congress for having &quot;cultural significance or a historical significance&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported Grant said its inclusion was due to the game&#x27;s nonlinear play being a &quot;mainstay of contemporary games&quot;, and how it allows the player to move backward and forward in levels. On November 20, 2020, a sealed copy with rare alternate cover art featuring &quot;Bros.&quot; on the left instead of the center was sold for $156,000, the most money ever paid for a video game at the time.

<text>Super Mario World, known in Japan as &quot;&quot;&#x27; is a 1990 platform game developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The player controls Mario on his quest to save Princess Peach and Dinosaur Land from the series&#x27; antagonist Bowser and the Koopalings. The gameplay is similar to that of earlier &quot;Super Mario&quot; games; players control Mario through a series of levels in which the goal is to reach the goalpost at the end. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; introduces Yoshi, a ridable dinosaur who can eat enemies and spit some of them out as projectiles.

Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development developed the game, led by director Takashi Tezuka and producer and series creator Shigeru Miyamoto. It is the first &quot;Mario&quot; game for the SNES and was designed to make the most of the console&#x27;s technical features. The development team had more freedom compared to the series installments for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Yoshi was conceptualised during the development of the NES games but was not used until &quot;Super Mario World&quot; due to hardware limitations.

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; is often considered one of the best games in the series and is cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It sold more than twenty million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling SNES game. It also led to an animated television series of the same name and a 1995 sequel, &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;. The game has been re-released on multiple occasions: It was part of the 1994 compilation &quot;Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World&quot; for the SNES and was re-released for the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2&quot; in 2001, on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Wii U, and New Nintendo 3DS consoles, and as part of the Super NES Classic Edition. In 2019, it was released for Nintendo Switch Online as part of the classic games service.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Super Mario World&quot; is a 2D side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls Mario or Luigi, the protagonists of the game. The game has similar gameplay to earlier games in the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;but introduces new elements. As well as dashing and jumping, the player can also fly or float with the aid of the Cape Feather and P-Balloon and can execute the new Spin Jump move, which allows the player to crush enemies, bounce off normally-invulnerable ones safely or break certain blocks, with the latter only being possible if the player has a power-up active. The game has 96 level exits in total.

The player navigates through the game via two game screens: an overworld map and a side-scrolling course (some of which scroll automatically). The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world&#x27;s entrance to a castle. Paths connect to action panels, fortresses, ghost houses, castles, and other map icons, allowing players to take different routes to reach the world&#x27;s goal. Moving the on-screen character to an action panel or castle grants access to that course. The majority of the game takes place in 2D linear levels, populated with obstacles and enemies, which involves the player traversing the stage by dashing, jumping, and dodging or defeating enemies. The player is given a number of lives, which are lost if Mario comes into contact with an enemy while Small Mario, falls off the screen, gets crushed, touches lava, or runs out of time. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although the player can continue from the most recent save point (a successfully completed castle, fortress or haunted house) by selecting &quot;Continue&quot;. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; each of the seven worlds features fortresses controlled by one of the Koopalings, and the player also battles Bowser in his castle in the seventh and final world. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; includes a multiplayer option which allows two players to play the game by alternating turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the second player controls his brother, Luigi.

In addition to the power-ups from previous games, such as the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; has a new power-up named the Cape Feather, which gives Mario a cape and the ability to fly, glide in the air, and use the cape as a sail. The game also introduces the ability to &quot;store&quot; an extra power-up in a box at the top centre of the screen. For example, if the player obtains a Fire Flower or a Cape Feather, then a Super Mushroom will appear in the box. Collecting a star grants Mario temporary invincibility from minor dangers. However, it does not protect the player from falling into lava or off the screen, nor if the player runs out of time. If Mario gets hit by an enemy, the stored item in the box will automatically drop. Alternatively, the player can manually release the stored item at any time.

The game introduces Yoshi, a dinosaur companion Mario can ride who is able to eat most enemies. If Yoshi attempts to eat a Koopa or its shell, he can spit it out and fire it at enemies. If the player fails to spit the shell out within a certain amount of time, Yoshi will swallow it, rendering it useless. When holding any Koopa shell in his mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its color: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes him to emit dust clouds that defeat nearby enemies, and a red shell allows him to produce three fireballs that defeat enemies. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also has hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each colored Yoshi by finding its egg in the Star World areas and feeding it either five enemies, a Super Mushroom, a Fire Flower, a Cape Feather, or a Starman causing the baby Yoshi to mature.

Although the main objective is to navigate through seven worlds to reach the end of the game, the player can beat the game much faster by using secret Star Road routes. To access a hidden world, the player needs to find keys scattered throughout the game&#x27;s levels. When a key is found, it must be brought to a keyhole to unlock either a new level or a Star Road. Exploring these secret stages can lead to other stages, such as the Special World. Completion of the Special Zone permanently changes some of the enemies&#x27; sprites and alters the overworld map&#x27;s color scheme.

== Plot ==

The plot of &quot;Super Mario World&quot; is detailed in the instruction booklet. After bringing peace to the Mushroom World in &quot;Super Mario Bros.3&quot;, the brothers Mario and Luigi decide to go on vacation with Princess Toadstool to a place called Dinosaur Land, a prehistoric-themed world swarming with dinosaurs and other enemies. While resting on the beach, the princess is captured by Bowser. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out of it comes a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who tells them his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by Bowser&#x27;s kids, the evil Koopalings. Mario and Luigi soon realise that Bowser&#x27;s forces must have captured Toadstool as well. Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi set out to rescue the princess and Yoshi&#x27;s dinosaur friends, traversing through Dinosaur Land for Bowser and his Koopalings. To aid him, Yoshi gives Mario a cape as they begin their journey.

Bowser receives news of Mario and Luigi&#x27;s approach and dispatches his Koopalings to dispose of them. After the brothers defeat the children and rescue Yoshi&#x27;s friends, they eventually reach Bowser&#x27;s Castle, where they fight him in a final battle. They send Bowser flying into the sky and save Princess Toadstool, restoring peace to Dinosaur Land.

== Development ==

The game was directed by Takashi Tezuka, while Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of both &quot;Super Mario&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, served as producer. Shigefumi Hino took the role of graphics designer. Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development handled development with a team of ten people, including three main programmers and a character designer, most of whom had worked on past &quot;Super Mario&quot; titles. In a retrospective interview, the core team said Miyamoto wielded the most authority during development.

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; was the first &quot;Mario&quot; series game developed for the then-upcoming Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. According to Tezuka, the software tools were not yet fully developed, and the team had to &quot;go along with starting something new&quot;. Miyamoto acknowledged the team no longer had restrictions on certain mechanics such as scrolling and the number of colours they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported &quot;Super Mario Bros.3&quot; to the SNES. However, it felt like the same game to them, despite the improved colours and sprites. After that, Miyamoto realised the team&#x27;s goal would be to use the new hardware to create something &quot;totally new&quot;.

Miyamoto said he had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, but Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back even further; Miyamoto designed a green dragon for the 1984 game &quot;Devil World&quot; which shared many similarities with Yoshi. During the development of &quot;Super Mario Bros.3&quot;, Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk, including an image of Mario riding a horse. As development of &quot;Super Mario World&quot; progressed, the team opted to set the game in a &quot;dinosaur land&quot;, so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile-like creature based on Miyamoto&#x27;s sketches. Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian, and &quot;didn&#x27;t really fit into the Mario world&quot;, so he encouraged the designer to create a &quot;cuter&quot; character. Tezuka speculated that Miyamoto&#x27;s love of horse riding, as well as country and western themes, influenced Yoshi&#x27;s creation.

Reflecting on how he had created different melodies for &quot;Super Mario Bros.3&quot;, composer Koji Kondo decided to reuse the same themes for &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, albeit in a rearranged form. By doing this, he assumed players would be able to recognise the same melodies, while exposing them to new variations of music as they progressed through the game. As &quot;Super Mario World&quot; was the first game developed for the SNES, Kondo felt &quot;overjoyed&quot; at being able to compose music by using eight sounds at once. To express the technological novelty of the new console, he used several different instruments, implementing them all one after the other in the game&#x27;s title song. As development progressed, Kondo grew concerned over how people would react to his unusual combinations of instruments as he noted the use of more traditional square waves and triangle waves had &quot;gained acceptance&quot; with consumers. For the game&#x27;s sound effects, Kondo decided to use a variety of musical instruments, as opposed to square waves, to emphasise that the game used traditional technology with a hybrid of new materials. It took Kondo around a year and a half to write all the music for the game.

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; was produced during the console warsa result of the rivalry between Nintendo&#x27;s SNES and Sega&#x27;s two-year-old Mega Drive systemwhich outsold the console and led to intense competition between the two, being the first time since December 1985 Nintendo did not lead the market though it eventually overtook Sega. Sega&#x27;s mascot, Sonic the Hedgehog, was seen by many as a faster and &quot;cooler&quot; alternative to Mario. After the game&#x27;s release, Miyamoto admitted publicly he felt it was incomplete and development was rushed toward the end.

== Release ==

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; was first released in Japan on 21 November 1990 under the name of &quot;Super Mario World: Super Mario Bros. 4&quot;. It was one of two launch games for the SNES in Japan, along with &quot;F-Zero&quot;. The game was released in North America on 23 August 1991. Nintendo also issued a version for arcade cabinets so players could try the game before buying it.

=== Re-releases ===

The game was re-released in a special version of &quot;Super Mario All-Stars&quot;, &quot;Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World&quot;, as a pack-in game for the SNES in December 1994. &quot;All-Stars&quot; contains enhanced remakes of the first four &quot;Super Mario&quot; games released for the NES: &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.2&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.3&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels&quot;. In contrast to the other games in the collection, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; is largely identical to the original version, but Luigi&#x27;s sprites were updated to make him a distinctive character rather than a palette swap of Mario.

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; was ported to the Game Boy Advance as &quot;Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2&quot; between 2001 and 2002. It features the same number of levels as the original, Luigi as a playable character in single player with his characteristic behaviour and appearance from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;, Game Link Cable support for four players in the &quot;Mario Bros. Classic&quot; mode, and the ability to save anywhere, rather than just after beating Ghost houses or Castles. Difficulty is lowered as being hit by an enemy no longer makes him lose all current power ups. Additionally, the alternate overworld map and enemy sprites that was normally unlocked by beating the Special World is now instead unlocked by finding every exit in each level. It received positive reviews; critics enjoyed its new inclusions and retention of the SNES original&#x27;s &quot;feel&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it the best video game of February 2002.

The SNES version was released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in Japan on 2December 2006, in the United States on 5February 2007, and in Europe on 9February 2007. It was released for the Wii U in North America and Japan on 26 April 2013, and in Europe on 27 April 2013, along with the full launch of the Wii U Virtual Console. On March 3, 2016, the game was released for the Virtual Console service of the New Nintendo 3DS. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; was also one of the 21 SNES games included in the Super NES Classic Edition released in September 2017. On 5September 2019, Nintendo released &quot;Super Mario World&quot; on their Nintendo Switch Online service as a launch title.

== Reception ==

Nintendo has sold 20.61 million copies of the game worldwide, making it the best-selling game for the SNES. In the United States, &quot;Super Mario Advance2&quot; for the Game Boy Advance sold 2.5 million copies and earned $74million in revenue by August 2006. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, it became the second highest-selling portable game in the United States.

&quot;Super Mario World&quot; received critical acclaim. In December 2019, review aggregator GameRankings ranked &quot;Super Mario World&quot; as the 78th highest-rated game of all time, with an aggregate score of 94% based on nine reviews.

The visuals and presentation were two of the most praised aspects of the game. After its release, Rob Swan of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; noted that the graphics were an excellent example of what the then-new SNES was capable of, while in the same review, Paul Glancey similarly remarked that the visuals were stunning, and he was grateful the game came free with the console. Four reviewers echoed this in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly,&quot; but commented that the game took little advantage of the SNES&#x27;s capabilities compared to other games available for the system. Retrospective reviewers agreed the game&#x27;s visuals were still of a high quality. Karn Bianco from &quot;Cubed3&quot; enjoyed the game&#x27;s relaxed visual style, and praised Nintendo for keeping everything &quot;nice and simple&quot; designing a game perfect for children. &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Lucas Thomas heralded the game as a significant leap over the visuals of the 8-bit era, but in retrospect felt it did not distinguish itself from being a graphically-upgraded continuation of its predecessor, &quot;Super Mario Bros.3&quot;. In contrast, Frédéric Goyon of &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; thought the game brought out the full potential of the SNES (albeit less so than &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;), and Nadia Oxford from &quot;USGamer&quot; also felt the game was a less rigid version of its predecessor. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Skyler Miller and Alex Navarro of &quot;GameSpot&quot; both praised the game&#x27;s well-drawn characters, colourful visuals and pleasing animation. Morgan Sleeper of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; said &quot;Super Mario World&quot; was the &quot;graphical holy grail&quot; that retro-styled games aspire to, and he insisted that its design holds up well today.

Critics commended the game&#x27;s replay value and unique gameplay in comparison to older &quot;Super Mario&quot; games. Four reviewers in &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the game&#x27;s number of secrets and diversity among its levels, expressing appreciation that Nintendo did not recycle assets from &quot;Super Mario Bros.3&quot;. Swan and Glancey enjoyed the addictive gameplay and the vast number of levels, while Dan Whitehead of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; lauded the game&#x27;s divergence from linear platforming and asserted that &quot;Super Mario World&quot; was an evolutionary leap for gaming in general. Likewise, Goyon appreciated the option of being able to finish the game by using alternative routes. Bianco opined that the game was &quot;one of the smoothest platformers in existence&quot; while Thomas thought its &quot;masterful&quot; and innovative level design enhanced the overall experience. Navarro similarly felt the game featured some of the best and most challenging levels the series has offered thus far, saying &quot;nothing about the game feels out of place or superfluous&quot;. Miller considered the game&#x27;s overall length to be its strongest aspect, while Oxford thought &quot;Super Mario World&quot;″s gameplay could be both straightforward and complex, owing to the myriad of secrets the game contained. In retrospect, Sleeper believed the game&#x27;s biggest achievement was its level design, calling it an &quot;unrivalled master class&quot; with a constant sense of momentum.

The game&#x27;s audio was also well received by critics. Swan believed the game utilised the SNES&#x27; PCM chip to its fullest potential, and both he and Glancey agreed that the game&#x27;s sound effects were &quot;mindblowing&quot;. Thomas labelled the soundtrack &quot;another one of Koji Kondo&#x27;s classics,&quot; but in hindsight remarked that it was not as memorable as his earlier work. Goyon praised the originality of the game&#x27;s soundtrack, and thought the technical contribution of the SNES allowed players to enjoy a &quot;globally magnificent&quot; composition. Both Goyon and Jason Schreier of &quot;Kotaku&quot; felt its rhythmic sound effects were important and helped to reinforce the game&#x27;s atmosphere. Miller liked &quot;Super Mario World&quot;″s upbeat music, and particularly enjoyed the echoing sound effects heard when Mario was undergrounda sentiment shared by other reviewers. Both Sleeper and Navarro wrote that the game featured the best music in the entire &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, with Sleeper praising Kondo&#x27;s &quot;timeless&quot; soundtrack and memorable melodies.

=== Awards ===

The game received 1991 Game of the Year awards from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; and &quot;Power Play&quot;. Many retrospective critics declared &quot;Super Mario World&quot; one of the greatest video games of all time. In 2009, a poll conducted by &quot;Empire&quot; voted it &quot;the greatest game of all time&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; placed the game 7th in a list of the greatest Nintendo games of all time. In its final issue in October 2014, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;Super Mario World&quot; the third-greatest Nintendo game of all time, behind &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; similarly named &quot;Super Mario World&quot; the fifth greatest game of all time, a step up from its eighth best ranking in their 2006 poll. The game has appeared on several &quot;best video games of all time&quot; lists such as those from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot;, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; ranked it as the best platform game of all time, while &quot;USgamer&quot; listed it as the best &quot;Super Mario&quot; platform game ever in 2015. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked &quot;Super Mario World&quot; 3rd on their &quot;The &quot;GamesMaster&quot; SNES Top 10&quot; list. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; listed the game 11th on its Top 100 SNES Games, at the time they opined &quot;Super Mario World&quot; is &quot;a contender for the best game ever.&quot;

== Legacy ==

As a pack-in game for the SNES, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; helped popularise the console, and became the best-selling game of its generation. Shigeru Miyamoto has said that &quot;Super Mario World&quot; is his favourite &quot;Mario&quot; game.

Yoshi became one of the most important characters in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, re-appearing in later &quot;Super Mario&quot; games and in nearly all &quot;Mario&quot; sports and spin-off games. Yoshi appears as the main playable character in &quot;Super Mario World&quot;″s 1995 prequel &quot;Super Mario World2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;, which helped lead to multiple video games focused on the character. A &quot;Super Mario World&quot; clone, &quot;Super Mario&#x27;s Wacky Worlds&quot;, was in development for the Philips CD-i device by NovaLogic from 1992 to 1993, but was cancelled because of the console&#x27;s commercial failure. In a poll conducted in 2008, Yoshi was voted as the third-favourite video game character in Japan, with Cloud Strife and Mario placing second and first.

DIC Entertainment produced an animated series of the same name, consisting of thirteen episodes, which ran on NBC from September to December 1991. &quot;Super Mario World&quot; has a large ROM hacking scene, with fans using applications such as Lunar Magic to create levels and insert new graphics, music, and mechanics; &quot;Kaizo Mario World&quot; is notable for being featured in many Let&#x27;s Play videos and popularizing the word &quot;Kaizo&quot; to signify hacks of extreme difficulty. In a similar way, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; is one of the four games whose assets are available in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;, a custom level creator released for the Wii U in 2015, in its port to Nintendo 3DS in 2016, and its 2019 sequel. The latter adds new snow and nighttime themes for &quot;Super Mario World&quot; levels accompanied by new music composed by Kondo.

<doc id="81118" wikidata="Q984029" url="?curid=81118" title="Luigi's Mansion">
<text>is a 2001 action-adventure video game developed and published by Nintendo. The game was a launch title for the GameCube and was the first game in the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise to be released for the console; it was released in Japan on September 14, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, in Europe on May 3, 2002, and in Australia on May 17, 2002. It is the third video game in which Luigi is the main character instead of Mario, after &quot;Mario Is Missing!&quot; and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Hammer Toss&quot;. Players control him as he explores a haunted mansion to rescue Mario and battles ghosts by capturing them through a vacuum cleaner supplied by Professor E. Gadd.

&quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; received a positive critical reception overall, with reviewers praising the gameplay, setting, and soundtrack, though its short length was criticized. The game has sold over 3.3 million copies, and is the fifth-best-selling GameCube game of all time. It was one of the first games to be re-released as a Player&#x27;s Choice title on the system. Initial fan reception to the game was mixed, however it improved over the years and achieved a cult following. The game was followed by two sequels – &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot;, released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3&quot;, which was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2019. A remake of &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; for the 3DS, co-developed by Nintendo and Grezzo, was released in 2018.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;″s story takes place over four &quot;areas&quot;, or sets of explorable rooms between boss fights. Players may also access a training room and a gallery at Professor E. Gadd&#x27;s laboratory between areas or upon starting the game. In each area, players control Luigi to explore the mansion&#x27;s rooms and hunt down the ghosts within them, acquiring keys to get through locked doors and eventually fighting a boss ghost at the end of the area. To assist him in his task, Luigi uses a flashlight and two inventions supplied by E. Gadd – the Poltergust 3000, a specially modified, high-powered vacuum cleaner; and the Game Boy Horror, a play on Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Color.

To capture ghosts, Luigi must first stun a ghost with his flashlight, revealing its heart. He then must use the Poltergust 3000 to suck them up, steadily reducing the ghost&#x27;s hit points to zero, at which point they are captured. The more hit points the ghost has, the more time it takes for a ghost to be captured, giving them a chance to break free while leaving Luigi more exposed to harm. If Luigi&#x27;s HP is reduced to zero from being hurt by the ghosts or other accidents, the game is over. Along his journey, Luigi locates three elemental medals, each granting the Poltergust with the ability to summon and vacuum ghosts from fire, water, and ice sources and expel their respective elements to capture specific ghosts or solve puzzles. In addition to capturing the regular ghosts in the mansion, Luigi must catch &quot;portrait ghosts&quot; from some rooms, each requiring a condition be met to make them available for capture. Rooms are usually dark upon initial access, and Luigi hums nervously to the music, but once all the ghosts are captured, it brightens up, and Luigi pleasantly whistles the melody.

Using the Game Boy Horror, players can access a map of the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror automatically indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device allows the player to examine objects (including the hearts of portrait ghosts, revealing clues about how to capture them), read profiles of captured portrait ghosts, and keep track of any treasure that Luigi has found. Rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, bills, gold bars, pearls, or gems. The treasures are typically hidden inside objects as well as chests that appear when rooms are cleared, though they can also be found from vacuuming ghosts. Luigi can gather these treasures by walking into them or vacuuming them; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a few coins that he will need to recover before they disappear. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the GB Horror can be used to find each one hiding in a room through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one. Boos can only be located in cleared rooms. Boos are trickier to catch, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the GB Horror and will escape into other rooms if they can.

Once an area is completed, all portrait ghosts are restored to their paintings by E. Gadd, which the player can view in his laboratory&#x27;s gallery, at which point a result screen reveals the portrait ghosts Luigi has captured, along with the total amount of treasure he recovered for that stage. Once the final boss is defeated, the player is given a rank (A to H) after the end credits based on the amount of treasure Luigi has found. Completing the game once unlocks a second mode called the &quot;Hidden Mansion&quot;, which features a stronger Poltergust and stronger ghosts. In the European version of this mode, the mansion appears as a mirrored reflection of the previous version, bosses are more difficult, ghosts and Portrait Ghosts are trickier to capture, and more ghosts appear in some of the rooms.

==Plot==
Luigi has been notified about winning a mansion in a contest he never entered. He informs Mario and they agree to meet up at it that evening. Luigi follows a map to the mansion, located in a dark forest, and finds it more sinister-looking than the supplied photo. With Mario nowhere to be found, Luigi enters the mansion alone. He encounters a ghost, which attacks him, but is unexpectedly saved by a diminutive and elderly scientist who unsuccessfully tries to deter the ghost with a vacuum cleaner. They escape as more ghosts appear and the scientist introduces himself as Professor Elvin Gadd, or E. Gadd for short. He explains the mansion is supernatural in origin and only appeared a few days prior. E. Gadd tells Luigi that he saw Mario heading towards the mansion, but has not seen him since. Upon learning that Mario is Luigi&#x27;s brother, E. Gadd entrusts Luigi with his ghost-hunting equipment, the Poltergust 3000 vacuum cleaner and Game Boy Horror communication device, as Luigi re-enters the mansion to find Mario.

As Luigi explores the mansion, he discovers that it was created by King Boo to shelter the now-freed special ghosts that E. Gadd had previously captured and turned into paintings with a large machine dubbed the &quot;Ghost Portrificationizer&quot;; King Boo subsequently sent the false notification of Luigi winning the mansion to lure the Mario Bros. into a trap in retaliation for the Boos they defeated in the past. Working his way through each of the darkened floors, halls and locked rooms, Luigi recaptures the escaped ghosts and discovers that Mario has been trapped inside of a painting by King Boo and held captive in a secret ritualistic altar in the mansion&#x27;s basement. While recapturing the last of the ghosts, Luigi finds the key that unlocks the altar&#x27;s entrance and confronts King Boo, who, now disdainful over Luigi capturing his minions, pulls Luigi into the painting. Using his illusionary powers within a pocket dimension inside it, King Boo creates a suit-like replica of Bowser to combat Luigi. Using the replica’s abilities against it, Luigi is able force King Boo out of it and defeat him. Returned to the real world in the aftermath, Luigi finds Mario unconscious but still trapped within the painting, which he triumphantly carries out of the mansion. Returning to E. Gadd&#x27;s laboratory in the morning, he informs Luigi that the mansion has ceased to exist as they turn King Boo into a painting along with the last of the recaptured ghosts. Using the Ghost Portrificationizer&#x27;s reverse function soon after, Luigi and E. Gadd free Mario from his painting. In an epilogue, as a sign of gratitude towards Luigi for all his help, E. Gadd has a new non-haunted house for him built on the former site of the mansion. Its size depends on how much treasure Luigi had collected on his adventure.

==Development==
The game was revealed at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed to show off the graphical capabilities of the GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were not used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi screaming in horror at the camera, running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and a gloomy-looking Luigi standing outside the mansion with lightning flashing. These were animated at three graphic houses to pay homage to the GameCube. Soon after its creation, Nintendo decided to transform the demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; was shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. Development was led by Hideki Konno, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Takashi Tezuka. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.

The original plan for &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; involved a game where the levels revolved around a large mansion or complex. Beta tests were done with &quot;Mario&quot; characters in dollhouses and other buildings. As the lighting scheme was developed, darkness and shadows became key areas of focus, and an older American-styled haunted house was ultimately chosen as the setting. Once it was transitioned into a GameCube project, Luigi was selected as the main character to keep the game original and new. The other gameplay ideas, such as ghosts and the ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, were added later. Older concepts, such as a role-playing game-like system which made real-time changes to rooms, as well as a cave area located under the mansion, were scrapped due to the inclusion of the new ideas.

&quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;″s music was composed by Shinobu Tanaka and Kazumi Totaka, and as such contains &quot;Totaka&#x27;s Song&quot;, a song featured in almost every game that Totaka has composed. It is found by waiting on the controller configuration screen at the Training Room for about three and a half minutes. The main theme of &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; was orchestrated and arranged by Shogo Sakai for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;. The game featured voice actors Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario and Luigi, Jen Taylor as the voice of Toad, and an uncredited Totaka as the voice of E. Gadd. &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; received an award for its audio by BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Awards in 2002.

All GameCube systems support the display of stereoscopic 3D, and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; was planned to utilize this feature; however, 3D televisions were not widespread at the time, and it was deemed that compatible displays would be too cost-prohibitive for the consumer. As a result, the feature was not enabled outside of development.

==Reception==
Commercially, &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; is the most successful GameCube launch title and the best-selling game of November 2001. It sold 257,000 units during its first week on sale in the United States. According to Nintendo, the game was a large driving force behind the GameCube&#x27;s launch sales and sold more copies in its opening week than &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; had managed to sell. Despite meager sales in Japan at around 348,000 units in total, it became the fifth best-selling GameCube game in the United States, with sales of roughly 2.19 million units. In total it sold 3.33 million copies worldwide by 2020. It was also one of the first Player&#x27;s Choice titles on the console, along with &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; and &quot;Pikmin&quot;.

Critically, &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; was positively received, with reviewers praising the game&#x27;s graphics, design, and gameplay. &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; &quot;features some refreshing ideas&quot; and &quot;flashes of brilliance.&quot; The gaming magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the game for being &quot;very enjoyable while it lasts, with its clever puzzles and innovative game play.&quot; &quot;GameSpy&quot; said that the game features &quot;great visuals, imaginative game design and some classic Nintendo magic.&quot; The game was referred to as &quot;a masterful example of game design&quot; by &quot;GamePro&quot;. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; stated that &quot;the graphics are quite beautiful and the interesting game mechanics are enjoyable&quot;. The American-based publication &quot;Game Informer&quot; praised the gameplay, and referred to it as &quot;brilliant and up to par with Miyamoto&#x27;s best&quot;. The audio was praised by &quot;IGN&quot;, who considered Luigi&#x27;s voice acting as &quot;cute, humorous and satisfying&quot;, and &quot;GameSpy&quot;, who declared that the soundtrack remains &quot;subtle, amusing and totally suitable throughout the game&quot;. The Japanese video game publication &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded the game with a gold rating, and noted that the control system, while tricky at first, works well.

The game has also received criticism, mainly because of its length. &quot;GameSpot&quot; said that &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; &quot;fails to match the classic status of Mario&#x27;s adventures&quot; and that the &quot;short amount of time it takes to complete it makes it a hard recommendation&quot;. The review, however, also considered that the short length prevents the gameplay and audio from getting tiresome. GameSpot later named &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; the most disappointing game of 2001. &quot;GameSpy&quot; also criticized the game&#x27;s length, saying that it could be beaten in about six hours. Allgame declared that &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; &quot;ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive gameplay experience over the long-term&quot;. Fran Mirabella III of &quot;IGN&quot; felt that the game was sub-par, due to its &quot;predictable, formulaic gameplay.&quot; G4&#x27;s TV show &quot;X-Play&quot; criticized &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; in their special on &quot;Mario&quot; games and media, calling the game a letdown for players waiting for the first &quot;Mario&quot; game on the GameCube. &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; was awarded the 2002 BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for audio. The game placed 99th in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time.

==Legacy==

&quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; introduces two characters, Professor Elvin Gadd, or E. Gadd for short, and King Boo. E. Gadd has reappeared in other &quot;Mario&quot; games, such as &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time&quot;. E. Gadd is referenced in &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; as the creator of Mario&#x27;s F.L.U.D.D. device and Bowser Jr.&#x27;s paintbrush. He also appears as a playable character skin in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot;. King Boo has also reappeared in other games, either as a boss (including &quot;Super Mario 64 DS&quot; and &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;) or a playable character (including &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; and &quot;Mario Super Sluggers&quot;).

The mansion in the game has reappeared in other &quot;Mario&quot; games, usually acting as Luigi&#x27;s home stage. It appeared in &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash!!&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; (&quot;Deluxe&quot;), &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot;, &quot;Mario Super Sluggers&quot;, &quot;Mario Hoops 3-on-3&quot;, &quot;Mario Sports Mix&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. The Wii U launch title &quot;Nintendo Land&quot; features &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Ghost Mansion&quot;, a multiplayer minigame based on &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;. In this minigame, four players controlling Miis dressed up as Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi have to drain the energy of a ghost, while the GamePad player, controlling the ghost, must make all the other players faint before time runs out.

A direct sequel for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot;, was released in March 2013, almost twelve years after the release of &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;, to celebrate the Year of Luigi. In 2015, Nintendo released &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion Arcade&quot;, an arcade game based on &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot; developed by Capcom and published by Sega. The game uses the same plot as &quot;Dark Moon&quot;, but goes for a first-person, on-rails gameplay style, and utilizes a special vacuum-based controller. The game is mostly found in Japanese arcades, although some cabinets have been localized and released at select Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s locations in the United States. A third installment, titled &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion 3&quot;, was released for the Nintendo Switch on October 31, 2019.

===3DS remake===
A remake of &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, co-developed by Nintendo and Grezzo, was announced on March 8, 2018, and released on October 12, 2018. 

Several years prior to the remake&#x27;s official announcement as a commercial project, Shigeru Miyamoto designed a working prototype of the game running on a 3DS development kit to test the system&#x27;s hardware and 3D functionality, which ultimately led to the development of &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion: Dark Moon&quot;. The remake has amiibo functionality and supports gyroscopic controls, the Circle Pad Pro accessory, the C-Stick on New Nintendo 3DS models, and stereoscopic 3D. Four other new features were added as new content: local cooperative play in which a second player takes on the role of a doppelgänger named &quot;Gooigi&quot;, a new control option that allows the use of the Strobulb flashlight from &quot;Dark Moon&quot;, an achievement list, and a boss rush mode where up to two players can attempt to clear boss fights as fast as possible. All regional releases of the remake also incorporate elements from the PAL version&#x27;s Hidden Mansion, increasing the difficulty of the second quest in the North American and Japanese versions. If the player scores high enough in the Hidden Mansion, they will achieve Rank S, one level higher than A, and be shown an even more luxurious version of Luigi&#x27;s new mansion after the credits. As of 2018, it has sold 90,410 copies in Japan, making it the third best-selling Nintendo 3DS release of 2018 behind &quot;WarioWare Gold&quot; and &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;.

Critical reception to the remake was generally positive; reviewers appreciated the effort put into the revamped visuals and many believe the core experience to largely hold up 17 years after the original release. Outlets also spoke positively about the implementation of stereoscopic 3D and the two screens as well as the new content such as the boss rush mode and the PAL Hidden Mansion.

<text>Gordias (, &quot;Gordías&quot;; also Γόρδιος, &quot;Górdios&quot;, &quot;Gordius&quot;) was the name of at least two members of the royal house of Phrygia.

The best-known Gordias was reputedly the founder of the Phrygian capital city Gordium, the maker of the legendary Gordian Knot, and the father of the legendary King Midas who turned whatever he touched to gold. The various legends about this Gordias and Midas imply that they lived sometime in the 2nd millennium BC.

==Gordias (father of Midas)==

In the founding myth of Gordium, the first Gordias was a poor farmer from Macedonia who was the last descendant of the royal family of Bryges. When an eagle landed on the pole of his ox-cart, he interpreted it as a sign that he would one day become a king. The eagle did not stir as he drove the cart to the oracle of Sabazios at the old, more easterly cult center, Telmissus, in the part of Phrygia that later became part of Galatia. At the gates of the city he encountered a seeress, who counselled him to offer sacrifices to Zeus/Sabazios:
:&quot;Let me come with you, peasant,&quot; she said, &quot;to make sure that you select the right victims.&quot; &quot;By all means,&quot; replied Gordius. &quot;You appear to be a wise and considerate young woman. Are you prepared to marry me?&quot; &quot;As soon as the sacrifices have been offered,&quot; she answered.

Meanwhile, the Phrygians, suddenly finding themselves without a king, consulted the oracle and were told to acclaim as king the first man to ride up to the temple in a cart. It was the farmer Gordias who appeared, riding in his ox-cart with his patroness.

Gordias founded the city of Gordium, which became the Phrygian capital. His ox-cart was preserved in the acropolis. In this manner the founding myth justified the succession of Gordium to Telmessos as cult center of Phrygia. Its yoke was secured with an intricate knot called the Gordian Knot. The legend of Gordium, widely disseminated by the publicists of Alexander the Great, said that he who could unravel it would be master of Asia (which was equated at the time with Anatolia). Instead, Alexander sliced the knot in half with his sword, in 333 BC.

Arrian has Midas, Gordias&#x27; son, assuming kingship instead of his father.

In some accounts, Gordias and the Phrygian goddess Cybele adopted Midas. In other accounts, Midas was their son. Herodotus says Midas was Gordias&#x27; son and does not mention Cybele. Herodotus also says that Gordias&#x27; son Midas had a garden in Macedonia, which could imply that Herodotus believed Gordias lived before the legendary Phrygian migration to Anatolia.

==Gordias (Herodotus)==

According to Herodotus, another member of the Phrygian royal line named Gordias was a contemporary of Croesus of Lydia. His son Adrastus accidentally killed his own brother and fled to Lydia where Croesus gave him asylum. Phrygia was a Lydian subject at this time. This Gordias was the son of another Midas. Herodotus does not mention if this Gordias was still alive when Adrastus fled, or if this Gordias or his father Midas ever reigned as (vassal) kings. This Gordias and Midas pair are otherwise unknown.

Some historians believe Herodotus used the name Gordias for the father of another Midas still, who ruled Phrygia in the late 8th century BC. Herodotus wrote that a &quot;Midas, son of Gordias&quot; donated a throne to the Oracle of Delphi. This Midas, of the late 8th century BC, had a Greek wife and strong ties to the Greeks, which suggests it was he who made the offering; but Herodotus also says Gyges of Lydia, a contemporary of this Midas, was &quot;the first foreigner since Midas&quot; to make an offering at Delphi, which suggests Herodotus believed the throne was donated by the more ancient Midas.

<text>In Greek mythology, Evadne (; Ancient Greek: Εὐάδνη) was a name attributed to the following individuals:

*Evadne, a daughter of Strymon and Neaera, wife of Argus (king of Argos), mother of Ecbasus, Peiras, Epidaurus and Criasus.
*Evadne, a daughter of Poseidon and Pitane who was raised by Aepytus of Arcadia. She experienced the joys of her first love with Apollo. However, when her consequent pregnancy was discovered by Aepytus, he was furious and left to consult the Oracle of Apollo. During the childbirth, Apollo sent Eileithyia and the Moirae to assist his lover and ease her pain. Evadne gave birth in the wilderness and left the child, Iamus, exposed to the elements. Five days later, Aepytus returned from the Delphi, where he had been told by Apollo&#x27;s Oracle that Evadne&#x27;s child was indeed the son of Apollo and destined to be a gifted prophet. He demanded that the child be brought to him, and so Evadne retrieved Iamus from the patch of violets where she had left him. Iamus had been nurtured for those five days by the honeybees that were sent by Apollo, or by the Fates. Evadne named the child Iamus (“Boy of the Violets”). He went on to found the Iamidae, a family of priests from Olympia.
*Evadne, a daughter of Pelias, King of Iolcus. She was given by Jason in marriage to Canes, son of Cephalus and a king of Phocis.
*Evadne, daughter of Iphis of Argos or Phylax (or Phylacus) and wife of Capaneus, with whom she gave birth to Sthenelus. Her husband was killed by a lightning bolt in the war of the Seven against Thebes, and she threw herself on his funeral pyre and died. In some accounts, she was called the daughter of Ares.

<text>In Greek mythology, Iamus (Ancient Greek: Ἴαμος) was the son of Apollo and Evadne, a daughter of Poseidon, raised by Aepytus. 

== Mythology ==
Evadne loved Apollo and by him she became pregnant, but was shamed by Aepytus for her pregnancy. When it was time for the childbirth, Apollo sent down Eileithyia and the Moirai (Fates) to assist Evadne. After giving birth, she unwillingly abandoned the child in the wild and returned. The child survived, as he was nourished by some honeybees sent by Apollo, or the Fates. When Aepytus learnt from the Delphic Oracle that the new born was sired by Apollo himself and was destined to be a great prophet, he ordered to bring the child back into the house. The infant was found alive lying among violets, and was named Iamus (from ίον, &quot;violet&quot;) by Evadne.

When he reached his youth, Iamus descended into the waters of Alpheios and invoked Poseidon, his grandfather, and Apollo, his father, asking them to reveal his destiny to him. Only Apollo answered his prayer, and appearing to him, took him to Olympia. There, Apollo taught him the art of prophecy and gave him the power to understand and explain the voices of birds. Iamus later founded the Iamidae, a family of priests from Olympia.

<text>In Greek mythology, Capaneus (; Ancient Greek: Καπανεύς &quot;Kapaneús&quot;) was a son of Hipponous and either Astynome (daughter of Talaus) or Laodice (daughter of Iphis), and husband of Evadne, with whom he fathered Sthenelus. Some call his wife Ianeira.

==Mythology==
According to the legend, Capaneus had immense strength and body size and was an outstanding warrior. He was also notorious for his arrogance. He stood just at the wall of Thebes during the war of the Seven against Thebes and shouted that Zeus himself could not stop him from invading it. Vegetius refers to him as the first to use ladders in a siege. In Aeschylus, he bears a shield with a man without armour withstanding fire, a torch in hand, which reads &#x27;I will burn the city,&#x27; in token of this. While he was mounting the ladder, Zeus struck and killed Capaneus with a thunderbolt, and Evadne threw herself on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre and died. His story was told by Aeschylus in his play &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, by Euripides in his plays &quot;The Suppliants&quot; and &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot;, and by the Roman poet Statius.

==Popular culture==
* In the fourteenth canto of his &quot;Inferno&quot;, Dante sees Capaneus in the seventh circle (third round) of Hell. Along with the other blasphemers, or those &quot;violent against God&quot;, Capaneus is condemned to lie supine on a plain of burning sand while fire rains down on him. He continues to curse the deity (whom, being a pagan, he addresses as &quot;Jove&quot; [Jupiter]) despite the ever harsher pains he thus inflicts upon himself, so that God &quot;thereby should not have glad vengeance.&quot;
* In Ezra Pound&#x27;s poem &quot;Hugh Selwyn Mauberley&quot;, Capaneus is mentioned, with the implication that Mauberly (and by extension Pound himself) shared the ancient hero&#x27;s daring and over-confidence.
* In Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s collection &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, in &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, Theseus meets a woman who declares herself to be the widow of Capaneus and criticizes her for crying and wailing, accusing her of being envious of his honour.

<text>Pedro Augusto del Valle (August 28, 1893 – April 28, 1978) was a United States Marine Corps officer who became the first Hispanic to reach the rank of lieutenant general. His military career included service in World War I, the Banana Wars, and in World War II, the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Okinawa (Commanding General of the 1st Marine Division).

==Early years==
Del Valle was born on August 28, 1893, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, when the island was still under Spanish colonial rule. His father was Dr. Pedro del Valle, who served as inspector general for the colonial government during the Spanish–American War. In 1900, two years after the war, the del Valle family moved to Maryland. His uncle, Dr. Francisco del Valle, a surgeon, stayed in Puerto Rico and served as Mayor of San Juan from 1907 to 1910. The del Valle family became U.S. citizens as a result of the Jones–Shafroth Act of 1917 which gave a United States Citizenship with limited rights to all the Puerto Ricans born on the island. He received his primary and secondary education in Maryland.

On June 17, 1911, after he graduated from high school, del Valle received an appointment by George Radcliffe Colton, who served from 1909 to 1913 as the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico, to attend the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He graduated from the academy in June 1915 and was commissioned a second lieutenant of the Marine Corps on June 5, 1915.

==Military career==
Following the graduation, del Valle participated in the expeditionary duty in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, in 1916. Del Valle commanded the Marine detachment on board the in the North Atlantic during World War I. In 1919, he participated in the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet. Later he served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Major General Joseph Henry Pendleton after serving on a tour of sea duty aboard the . His job included an inspection tour of the West Indies in the company of General Pendleton.

===Banana Wars===
In 1926, del Valle served with the Gendarmerie of Haiti for three years and, during that time, he also became active in the war against Augusto César Sandino in Nicaragua. In 1929, he returned to the United States and attended the Field Officers Course at the Marine Corps School in MCB Quantico, Virginia.

In 1931, Brigadier General Randolph C. Berkeley appointed del Valle to the &quot;Landing Operations Text Board&quot; in Quantico, the first organizational step taken by the Marines to develop a working doctrine for amphibious assault. In 1932, he wrote an essay titled &quot;Ship-to-Shore in Amphibious Operations&quot; which was published in the &quot;Marine Corps Gazette&quot;. In his essay, he stressed the importance of a coordinated amphibious assault and of an execution of an opposed landing.

He worked as an intelligence officer in Havana in 1933 under Admiral Charles Freeman, following the Cuban Sergeant&#x27;s Revolt. From 1935 to 1937, del Valle was assistant naval attache, attached to the American Embassy to Italy in Rome. While on duty, del Valle participated as an observer with the Italian Forces during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. The experiences which del Valle gained as an observer led him to author the book &quot;Roman Eagles Over Ethiopia&quot; where he describes the events leading up to the Italian expedition and the complete movements of combat operations by the Italian Army under Generals De Bono, Badoglio, and Graziani.

During the course of his service, De Valle revealed himself to be a fervent admirer of Benito Mussolini. He became a close friend of antisemitic propagandist James True and distributed &quot;subversive&quot; literature from George Deatherage’s Knights of the White Camellia and William Dudley Pelly&#x27;s Silver Shirts. In 1939, he was ordered to attend the Army War College in Washington, D.C., and after graduating was named executive officer of the Division of Plans and Policies, USMC.

===World War II===
In March 1941, del Valle became the commanding officer of the 11th Marine Regiment, (artillery). Upon the outbreak of World War II, del Valle led his regiment and participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign, providing artillery support for the 1st Marine Division. In the Battle of the Tenaru, the firepower provided by del Valle&#x27;s artillery units killed many assaulting Japanese soldiers before they ever reached the Marine positions. The attackers were killed almost to the last man. The outcome of the battle was so stunning that the Japanese commander, Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, committed seppuku shortly afterwards.

Major General Alexander Vandegrift, impressed with del Valle&#x27;s leadership recommended his promotion and on October 1, 1942, del Valle became a brigadier general. Vandegrift retained del Valle as head of the 11th Marines, the only time that the regiment has ever had a general as their commanding officer. In 1943, he served as Commander of Marine Forces overseeing Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Russell and Florida Islands. He was decorated with the Legion of Merit for his merits during Guadalcanal campaign.

On April 1, 1944, del Valle was the commanding general of the Third Corps Artillery, III Marine Amphibious Corps, which participated in the Battle of Guam. He was awarded a gold star in lieu of a second Legion of Merit. The men under his command did such a good job with their heavy artillery that no one man could be singled out for commendation. Instead, each man was given a letter of commendation by del Valle which was carried in their record books.

In late October 1944, he succeeded Major General William H. Rupertus as commanding general of the 1st Marine Division, being personally greeted in his new command by Colonel Lewis Burwell &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller. At the time, the 1st Marine Division was training on the island of Pavuvu for the invasion of Okinawa. He subsequently led the division throughout the campaign. Del Valle was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership during the battle and the subsequent occupation and reorganization of Okinawa.

The &quot;very surprising and unpatriotic utterances&quot; del Valle had been making since 1941 led however to three separate investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Naval Intelligence and the War Office&#x27;s Military Intelligence Department. Colonel Housewitz, an aide to Marine Corps General Clifton B. Cates, stated that although del Valle had formerly been &quot;a very important figure in military circles&quot;, he was now &quot;more or less an embarrassment to the Marine Corps as a result of his loudly voiced antisemitic statements.&quot;

===Postwar===
After World War II ended, del Valle was ordered back to Headquarters Marine Corps, where he was named Inspector General, a position which he held until he retired on January 1, 1948. 

On February 19, 1946, New Mexico Senator Dennis Chavez and del Valle held a meeting with President Harry S. Truman in the White House, in which Chavez recommended del Valle for the position of governor of Puerto Rico. Local Puerto Rican politicians, such as Luis Muñoz Marín, opposed the naming of del Valle in favor of Jesús T. Piñero; to which del Valle eventually asked President Truman to withdraw his name among those considered for the position.

==Personal life and death==
After retiring from the Marine Corps, del Valle worked as a representative of ITT in the company&#x27;s office in Cairo. After some time with the company he was named president of ITT for all South America in Buenos Aires, a position that he held until 1951.

del Valle was married to Katharine Nelson (1890–1983). He died on April 28, 1978, in Annapolis, Maryland, and was buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery and Columbarium. In 2018, he was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

=== Defenders of the American Constitution ===
In the early 1950s, believing that the United States was in danger of a communist threat, del Valle tried to convince the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Defense to form a vigilante minuteman group. He also believed that the CIA should operate behind Russian and Chinese lines. After his ideas were turned down, he decided to form his own group.

On July 24, 1953, del Valle met with Colonel John H. Coffman, Colonel Eugene Cowles Pomeroy, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, and Major General Claire Chennault to form the Defenders of the American Constitution (DAC). The DAC believed in a &quot;one-worldist conspiracy&quot; led by New York Jewish financiers who controlled international communism, and described their goal as the defense of &quot;the US constitution against enemies and encroachments, both foreign and domestic.&quot; The idea behind the group was to organize the citizens in each state as vigilantes against sabotage and other forms of treason, then link them up in some national headquarters. 

The DAC had close ideological and organizational ties with British far-right groups, including the League of Empire Loyalists (with which it campaigned for the dismissal of Ezra Pound from St. Elizabeths Hospital). In the DAC&#x27;s official magazine &quot;Task Force&quot;, del Valle expressed considerable admiration for the work of the British fascist Peter Huxley-Blythe, calling Huxley-Blythe&#x27;s 1955 book &quot;Betrayal&quot; an &quot;excellent work&quot;, a &quot;courageous work&quot; and &quot;a tremendous contribution&quot;. &quot;Task Force&quot; combined its August and September editions of 1956 in order to reprint &quot;Betrayal&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the most important articles it has ever been a privilege to publish&quot;.

After del Valle&#x27;s death at age 85, the DAC ceased to exist. The American scholar William C. Baum wrote that del Valle displayed all of the signs of a deeply paranoid personality, leading him to conclude that del Valle was &quot;not part of an authentic conservative tradition of thought in America&quot; as he expressed &quot;...abnormal amounts of anger and frustration&quot; in his writings and he had &quot;more in common with the character of General Jack D. Ripper in the memorable film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; than with those with a considered commitment to the tenets of modern conservative thought&quot;.

<text>The Gironde estuary ( , ; , ; , ) is a navigable estuary (though often referred to as a river) in southwest France and is formed from the meeting of the rivers Dordogne and Garonne just downstream of the centre of Bordeaux. Covering around , it is the largest estuary in western Europe.

Giving its name to the French &quot;département&quot; Gironde, 
the Gironde estuary is approximately long and 3–12 km (2–7 miles) wide. It is subject to very strong tidal currents and great care is needed when navigating the estuary by any size or type of boat.

Since 2015, the Gironde estuary has been part of the Gironde estuary and Pertuis sea Marine Nature Park.

==Islands of the Gironde ==
Within the estuary between the Pointe de Grave at the seaward end and the Bec d&#x27;Ambès are a series of small islands.

The Île de Patiras is in size with a lighthouse to aid navigation in the estuary. Vines and maize are grown there.

The Île Sans-Pain and Île Bouchaud are now virtually joined due to progressive silting and are referred to as the Ile Nouvelle. They total about and are owned by the Conservatoire du Littoral and managed by the Department of the Gironde.

The Île Paté is about and in 2006 was privately owned. The island has a historic fort built between 1685 and 1693 as part of the national fortification program masterminded by Vauban. The building is oval in shape, about high and was originally equipped with about 30 cannons. Fort Paté, together with Fort Médoc on the left bank of the estuary and the ancient &quot;citadelle&quot; of Blaye on the right bank, defended the estuary and Bordeaux. During the French Revolution the fort was used as a prison for priests.

In 2006, the Conseil General decided to make the island a ZPENS (zone de pre-emption espace naturel sensible). ZPENS status protects the island from development. If the owner wishes to sell the island, then the Department has a pre-emptive right. After two months the Conservatoire National du Littoral has the next pre-emptive right and then after another 2 months the town of Blaye has a final pre-emptive right to acquire the island.

The Île Verte, Île du Nord and Île Cazeau comprise about and because of their natural state provide a fine stopping off place for migrating birds.

The Île Margaux is and in 2005 had devoted to vines and is part of the world famous Médoc wine region.

The Île Sans Nom which appeared in 2009 following Cyclone Klaus lies around east of Cordouan Lighthouse.

== Second World War ==

In December 1942, during the Second World War, Operation Frankton took place with the goal of destroying ships moored at the docks in Bordeaux.

The plan was for six canoes to be taken to the area of the Gironde estuary by submarine. Twelve men would then paddle by night to Bordeaux. On arrival they would attach timed limpet mines to the docked cargo ships and escape overland to Spain.

The raid was carried out by a small unit of Royal Marines known as the Royal Marines Boom Patrol Detachment (RMBPD), part of Combined Operations, led by Herbert &#x27;Blondie&#x27; Hasler. They succeeded in slipping into the harbour unnoticed and sank one ship and severely damaged four others. Only two of the men returned to the UK alive, but they did enough damage to greatly disrupt the use of the harbour for the following months.

The prototypes of the Char B1 ter heavy tank were lost in the Gironde as a result of German bombing in 1940.

<doc id="81153" wikidata="Q262192" url="?curid=81153" title="Agnes of Poitou">
<text>Agnes of Poitou ( – 14 December 1077) was the queen of Germany from 1043 and empress of the Holy Roman Empire from 1046 until 1056 as the wife of Emperor Henry III. From 1056 to 1061, she ruled the Holy Roman Empire as regent during the minority of their son Henry IV.

After the death of her husband, she proved an inexperienced regent unable to effectively assert her power and secure loyal allies. In Germany, she is still remembered as a sympathetic historical figure, even if a flawed politician.

==Early life==

Agnes was the daughter of the Ramnulfid Duke William V of Aquitaine (d. 1030) and Agnes of Burgundy and as such a member of the Ramnulfid family.

==Empress==

Agnes married King Henry III of Germany in November 1043 at the Imperial Palace Ingelheim. She was his second wife after Gunhilda of Denmark, who had died, possibly from malaria, in 1038. This marriage helped to solidify the Empire&#x27;s relationships with the princely houses in the west. King Henry was able to improve his position versus the French royal dynasty and to exert his influence in the Duchy of Burgundy. Agnes, like her husband, was of profound piety; her family had founded Cluny Abbey and Abbot Hugh the Great was godfather of her son Henry IV.

==Regency==
After her husband&#x27;s death on 5 October 1056, Empress Agnes served as regent on behalf of her young son Henry IV. Henry III had secured the election of his son as King of the Romans on his deathbed. Aided by Abbott Hugh of Cluny and Pope Victor II, also bishop of Eichstätt, Agnes tried to continue her husband&#x27;s politics and to strengthen the rule of the Salian dynasty. However, despite being related to kings of Italy and Burgundy, she gained little respect as a leader. The loss of some of her family&#x27;s ancestral lands later weakened her son&#x27;s position tremendously.

After Henry&#x27;s death, Agnes was placed in a difficult position between secular and religious powers. She had support from her retinue and territories she had brought from France upon her marriage, and she wanted to follow the example of Empress Adelheid. She was however more restricted than the Ottonian queen-empresses.

To win allies, she gave away three German duchies: already on Christmas 1056, the Ezzonid scion Conrad III, a nephew of Count palatine Ezzo of Lotharingia, received the Duchy of Carinthia. The next year she enfeoffed Rudolf of Rheinfelden with Swabia, appointed him administrator of Burgundy and offered him the hand of her daughter Matilda. According to the medieval chronicler Frutolf of Michelsberg, Rudolf had possibly abducted Matilda and extorted the betrothal. However, Agnes&#x27; late husband had promised the Swabian duchy to Berthold of Zähringen, who in turn had to be compensated with Carinthia upon Conrad&#x27;s death in 1061.

At the same time, while German forces interfered in the fratricidal struggle of King Andrew I and Béla I of Hungary, Agnes ceded the Duchy of Bavaria to Count Otto of Nordheim. He reached a settlement with Hungary by enforcing the coronation of Andrew&#x27;s son Solomon but later became a bitter rival of her son Henry IV.

Though initially a follower of the Cluniac Reforms, Agnes opposed the contemporary papal reform movement, and took the side of Italian anti-reform party. Things had worsened after the death of Pope Victor II in 1057: his successor Stephen IX was unable to take actual possession of Rome due to the Roman aristocracy&#x27;s election of antipope Benedict X, and Stephen sent Anselm of Lucca (future Pope Alexander II) and Hildebrand of Sovana (future Pope Gregory VII) to Germany to obtain the support of Agnes as regent.

Though Stephen died before being able to return to Rome, Agnes&#x27; help was instrumental in enabling Hildebrand to depose the antipope and to replace him by the bishop of Florence, Nicholas II. Thereafter, on Easter 1059 Nicholas issued the momentous papal bull &quot;In nomine Domini&quot; establishing the cardinals as the sole electors of the pope, denying this power to the emperor and all temporal rulers, including Agnes herself.

When Pope Alexander II was elected on 30 September 1061, Empress Agnes refused to acknowledge him and had Honorius II elected. This schism did not end until Pentecost 1064. The empress&#x27; candidate could not prevail against the Roman Curia; in consequence, Agnes retired from politics, leaving the regency to her confidant Bishop Henry II of Augsburg.

Bishop Henry did not receive wide acceptance due to his awkward and haughty manners, as well as scandalous rumours about his relationship with the empress, as recorded by Lambert of Hersfeld. Moreover, the fact that the heir to the throne was raised by common &quot;ministeriales&quot; provoked anger among the princes. In 1062, young Henry IV was abducted by a group including Archbishop Anno II of Cologne and Otto of Nordheim, in a conspiracy to remove Agnes from the throne, referred to as the Coup of Kaiserswerth. Henry was brought to Cologne, and despite jumping overboard to escape, he was recaptured. From this point, the power shifted to Rome, as the pope elected the emperor.

Defeated, Agnes resigned as regent and was replaced by Anno together with the archbishops Siegfried of Mainz and Adalbert of Bremen.

==Later life==
According to Frutolf of Michelsberg, Agnes retired to Fruttuaria Abbey after the coup. When Henry IV reached the age of majority, Agnes moved to Rome, where her arrival in 1065 is documented by Peter Damian. Agnes went on to act as a mediator and peacemaker between her son and the papacy. She died in Rome on 14 December 1077 and is buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Personality==
Agnes was a reserved and gentle woman, lacking the sternness and imposing qualities that characterized successful Ottonian and Salian queen-empresses like Matilda, Adelaide, Theophanu, Kunigunde and Gisela.

<text>The Duchy of Berry (; ; ) was a former province located in central France. It was a province of France until departments replaced the provinces on 4 March 1790, when Berry became divided between the &quot;départements&quot; of Cher (Upper Berry) and Indre (Lower Berry).

==History==
Berry is notable as the birthplace of several kings and other members of the French royal family, and was the birthplace of the knight Baldwin Chauderon, who fought in the First Crusade. In the Middle Ages, Berry became the center of the Duchy of Berry&#x27;s holdings. It is also known for an illuminated manuscript produced in the 14th–15th century called &quot;Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot;.

In later times, the writer George Sand spent much of her life at her Berry estate in Nohant, and Berry&#x27;s landscape and specific culture figure in much of Sand&#x27;s writings.

The Duchy was governed by the Duke/Duchess of Berry, who after 1601 was a senior member of the French royal family. The title of &#x27;Duke of Berry&#x27; was by this period divested of territorial significance, and instead held by princes of the royal house, the last of which was Charles Ferdinand d&#x27;Artois.

In c.750, the Counties of Berry and Bourges were created by the King of the Franks. In 843, the County of Berry became part of the Royal domain or crown lands controlled by the king. From 878 to 892, the county was part of the County of Auvergne, but became independent once more in 893. In 972, the County of Bourges was reduced to a Viscounty as the &quot;Viscomte de Bourges&quot;, and in 1101 was annexed by France. In 1360, the county was raised to a duchy as the Duchy of Berry. In 1221, the Seigneuries of Châteauroux and Issoudun were annexed into the duchy.

The first governor of the province appears to have been appointed on 14 March 1698, when Adrien Maurice de Noailles, Duke of Noailles became military governor when he was only 19 years old.

In 1778, Louis XVI convened the provincial assemblies of Berry, and considered expanding the assembly to other provinces, but abandoned this idea after experiencing the opposition of the privileged classes in Berry.

In 1790, when the former provinces were dissolved, the Duchy of Berry was split between two departments: Cher in Upper (eastern) Berry and Indre in Lower (western) Berry. Some communes also became part of the Allier, Creuse, Loiret, and Loir-et-Cher departments as well.

==Governors==
The governors of French provinces during the Ancien Régime were typically military commanders and provided military oversight in the region. This included recruitment, movement of troops, and – if needed – dealing with civil disobedience. Below is a list of the governors of Berry during its time as a province.

== Duke of Berry ==

In October 1360, the title &#x27;Duke of Berry&#x27; was created by King John II of France for his third-born son, John of Poitiers. The duke was followed by several members of the senior royal family, establishing a tradition of the duke being a member of the House of Valois. In 1505 however, the last Duchess of Berry Joan of France died of natural causes and the title was merged into the royal domain. In 1527, the title was re-created for Marguerite de Navarre until the title was once again dissolved in 1601 following the death of Duchess Louise of Lorraine.

In 1686, King Louis XIV re-created the title for his third grandson Charles de Bourbon, however the title was dissolved following the death of the Duke in 1714. In 1754, Louis XV re-created the title for his grandson Louis-Auguste de Bourbon (later King Louis XVI), who dropped the title in 1765 when he became Dauphin. In 1778, Louis XVI once again re-created the title for his nephew Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry. In 1820, the title was finally dissolved once more when the last duke was assassinated.

While Berry was a province, the Duke of Berry was de jure leader of the area. The dukes included:
==Etymology==
The name of &quot;Berry&quot;, like that of its capital, Bourges, originated with the Gaulish tribe of the Bituriges, who settled in the area before the Roman armies of Julius Caesar conquered Gaul. The name of the tribe gave name to the region, often mentioned in Medieval Latin sources as: &quot;Bituria&quot;.

==Brenne==
La Brenne, located west of Châteauroux and east of Tournon-Saint-Martin in the Indre department, is a region which of old straddled on the former provinces of Berry and Touraine, and is now a protected natural area (Parc naturel régional de la Brenne) as well called &quot;Pays des mille étangs&quot;, because of its many ponds created since the 8th c. by the monks of the local abbeys for pisciculture.

<doc id="81165" wikidata="Q639301" url="?curid=81165" title="Yello">
<text>Yello is a Swiss electronic music band, which formed in Zürich in 1979. For most of the band&#x27;s history, Yello has been a duo consisting of Dieter Meier and Boris Blank; founding member Carlos Perón left in 1983.

Their sound is often characterised by unusual music samples and a reliance on rhythm, with Meier as vocalist and lyricist, and Blank providing the music. Among their best known singles are &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; (1985), which has appeared in many films and television shows, including &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;, &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; and &quot;The Race&quot; (1988), which peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. The band has released 14 studio albums since 1980.

==History==

The band was formed by Boris Blank (keyboards, sampling, percussion, backing vocals) and Carlos Perón (tapes) in the late 1970s. Dieter Meier (vocals, lyrics), a millionaire investor and gambler, was brought in when the two founders realized that they needed a singer. The new band&#x27;s name, Yello, was chosen as a neologism based on a comment made by Meier, &quot;a yelled Hello&quot;.

Yello&#x27;s first release was the 1979 single &quot;I.T. Splash&quot;. The LP &quot;Solid Pleasure&quot;, featuring the original short version of &quot;Bostich&quot; (extended to a hit dance single in 1981), was released in November 1980. Yello&#x27;s first video was made for the song &quot;Pinball Cha Cha&quot; in 1981; this was included in a 1985 video exhibit at Museum of Modern Art in New York. In early 1983, just after release of &quot;You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess&quot;, Perón left Yello in order to pursue a solo career.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Stella&quot; went No. 1 in Switzerland in 1985 as the first album ever by a Swiss group to top the Swiss album chart. It also appeared inside the German top 10, gaining gold status. The song &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; from the album gained the band worldwide attention the following year, after it prominently appeared in the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; and then a year later in &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot;. The song was released shortly after and became the band&#x27;s only single to chart in the US, reaching No. 51, and their only top-50 hit in Australia, reaching No. 9.

In 1988, single &quot;The Race&quot; from the album &quot;Flag&quot; reached No. 7 in the UK as their only top-10 hit there. It featured in the film &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot;.

In 1995, a tribute remix album &quot;Hands on Yello&quot; was released, featuring remixes by Moby, the Orb, Carl Craig, Carl Cox, the Grid and WestBam.

In 2005, Yello re-released their early albums &quot;Solid Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Claro Que Si&quot;, &quot;You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess&quot;, &quot;Stella&quot;, &quot;One Second&quot; and &quot;Flag&quot;, all with bonus tracks, as part of the Yello Remaster Series.

A documentary on Yello, &quot;Electro Pop Made in Switzerland&quot;, directed by Anka Schmid, premiered at the Riff Raff cinema in Zürich in September 2005.

Yello was commissioned to produce music for the launch of the Audi A5 at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2007 and for the Audi A5 advertisement in May 2007.

==Style==
Yello&#x27;s sound is mainly characterized by unusual music samples, a heavy reliance on rhythm and Dieter Meier&#x27;s dark voice. Yello makes heavy use of sampling in the construction of rhythm tracks, such as in &quot;The Race&quot; from 1988. Boris Blank has taken a couple of vocal turns on &quot;Swing&quot; (from &quot;You Gotta Say Yes to Another Excess&quot;) and &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (from &quot;Flag&quot;). Guest vocalists have included Rush Winters, Billy Mackenzie, Stina Nordenstam, Jade Davies, Shirley Bassey, Heidi Happy and FiFi Rong. The group has shared writing credit with Mackenzie, Winters and Happy.

Yello rarely uses samples from previously released music; nearly every instrument has been sampled and re-engineered by Boris Blank, who over the years has built up an original sample library of thousands of named and categorised sounds.

== Live Performances ==
The band&#x27;s first live performance was on the 18th of September 1978 at the Cinema Forum in Zurich titled &quot;&quot;Dead Cat&quot;.&quot; The performance was originally 15-minutes long and only showed Meier, due to Boris&#x27; stage fright at the time. Out of the fifteen minutes of the performance, only four minutes have been publicly circulated on the internet. It has never been released on other formats.

Their second live performance was in December 1983 at the Roxy Club, where they played a more techno-like remix of &quot;Bostitch&quot;. It&#x27;s another 15-minute performance hosted by Dianne Brill. This time Boris is showing himself too. The single is available as a clear vinyl in the remaster series.

Their most recent live performance was on third of November 2017 in Berlin, where they played their older and newer songs with additional musicians and background vocalists.

<text>King Solomon&#x27;s Mines is an 1885 popular novel by the English Victorian adventure writer and fabulist Sir H. Rider Haggard. It tells of an expedition through an unexplored region of Africa by a group of adventurers led by Allan Quatermain, searching for the missing brother of one of the party. It is one of the first English adventure novels set in Africa and is considered to be the genesis of the lost world literary genre. It is the first of fourteen novels and four short stories by Haggard about Allan Quatermain. Haggard dedicated this book to his childhood idol Sir Humphry Davy.

==Background==
The book was first published in September 1885 amid considerable fanfare, with billboards and posters around London announcing &quot;The Most Amazing Book Ever Written&quot;. It became an immediate best seller. By the late 19th century, explorers were uncovering ancient civilisations and their remains around the world, such as Egypt&#x27;s Valley of the Kings and the empire of Assyria. Inner Africa remained largely unexplored and &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, one of the first novels of African adventure published in English, captured the public&#x27;s imagination.

The &quot;King Solomon&quot; of the book&#x27;s title is the legendary Biblical king renowned both for his wisdom and for his wealth. A number of sites have been suggested as the location of his mines, including the workings at the Timna valley near Eilat, Israel. Research published in September 2013 has shown that this site was in use during the 10th century BC as a copper mine possibly by the Edomites, who, the Bible reports, were rivals of and frequently at war with King Solomon. The Bible does refer to King Solomon having sent out, in partnership with his Phoenician allies, trading expeditions along the Red Sea, which brought exotic wares and animals from Africa to Jerusalem. Muslim traders in Sofala, Mozambique, told Portuguese travellers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries that the region&#x27;s gold mines belonged to King Solomon and that he built the now-ruined city of Great Zimbabwe.

Haggard knew Africa well, having travelled deep within the continent during the Anglo-Zulu War and the First Boer War, where he had been impressed by South Africa&#x27;s vast mineral wealth and by the ruins of ancient lost cities, such as Great Zimbabwe, being uncovered. His original Allan Quatermain character was based in large part on Frederick Selous, the British white hunter and explorer of Africa. Selous&#x27;s real-life experiences provided Haggard with the background and inspiration for this and many later stories.

Haggard also owed a considerable literary debt to Joseph Thomson, the Scottish explorer whose book &quot;Through Masai Land&quot; was published in 1885. Thomson claimed he had terrified warriors in Kenya by taking out his false teeth and claiming to be a magician, just as Captain Good does in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;. Contemporary James Runciman wrote an article entitled &quot;King Plagiarism and His Court&quot;, interpreted as accusing Haggard of plagiarism for this. Thomson was so outraged at Haggard&#x27;s alleged plagiarism that he published a novel of his own, &quot;Ulu: an African Romance&quot;, which, however, failed to sell.

==Plot==

Allan Quatermain, an adventurer and white hunter based in the African city of Durban, is approached by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry&#x27;s brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon&#x27;s Mines. Quatermain has a map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. He agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures his son will be provided for. They also take along a native, Umbopa, who seems more regal and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is anxious to join the party.

Travelling by oxcart, they reach the edge of a desert, but not before a hunt in which a wounded elephant claims the life of a servant. They continue on foot across the desert, almost dying of thirst before finding the oasis shown halfway across on the map. Reaching a mountain range called Suliman Berg, they climb a peak (one of &quot;Sheba&#x27;s Breasts&quot;), enter a cave and find the frozen corpse of José Silvestre, the 16th-century Portuguese explorer who drew the map in his own blood. That night, another servant dies from the cold, and they leave his body next to Silvestra&#x27;s.
They cross the mountains into Kukuanaland, a raised valley, lush and green. The inhabitants have a well-organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of IsiZulu. Kukuanaland&#x27;s capital is Loo, the destination of a road from ancient times. The city is dominated by a central royal kraal.

A party of Kukuana warriors are about to kill them when Captain Good nervously fidgets with his false teeth, making the Kukuanas recoil in fear. Thereafter, to protect themselves, they style themselves &quot;white men from the stars&quot;—sorcerer-gods—and are required to give regular proof of their divinity, considerably straining both their nerves and their ingenuity.

They are brought before King Twala, a ruthless and violent leader. He came to power years before by murdering his brother, the previous king, and driving his brother&#x27;s wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die. Twala&#x27;s rule is unchallenged. Gagool, an impossibly ancient hag, is his chief advisor. She roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. When she singles out Umbopa for this fate, it takes all of Quatermain&#x27;s skill to save his life.

Gagool, it appears, has already sensed what Umbopa later reveals: he is Ignosi, the rightful king of the Kukuanas. A rebellion breaks out, the Englishmen gaining support for Ignosi by taking advantage of their foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse to claim that they will black out the moon as proof of Ignosi&#x27;s claim. The Englishmen join Ignosi&#x27;s army in a furious battle. Although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow Twala, and Sir Henry lops off his head in a duel.

The Englishmen also capture Gagool, who reluctantly leads them to King Solomon&#x27;s Mines. She shows them a treasure room carved inside a mountain, full of gold, diamonds, and ivory. She then sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine&#x27;s stone door. However, a scuffle with Foulata— a Kukuana woman who became attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battle—causes Gagool to be crushed under the door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store of food and water dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After some despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the trove, enough to make them rich.

The Englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful Ignosi and return to the desert, assuring him that they value his friendship but must return to be with their own people, Ignosi in return promising them that they will be venerated and honoured among his people forever. Taking a different route, they find Sir Henry&#x27;s brother stranded in an oasis by a broken leg, unable to go forward or back. They all return to Durban and, eventually, back to England, wealthy enough to live out their lives in comfort.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Haggard wrote the novel as a result of a five-shilling wager with his brother, who said that he could not write a novel half as good as Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883). He wrote it in a short time, somewhere between six and sixteen weeks between January and 21 April 1885. However, the book was a complete novelty and was rejected by one publisher after another. After six months, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; was published, and the book became the year&#x27;s best seller, with printers struggling to print copies fast enough.

Andrew Lang praised the book in that day’s &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, describing it as a &quot;peculiarly thrilling and vigorous tale of adventure” and effusing &quot;we have only praise for the very remarkable and uncommon powers of invention and gift of &quot;vision&quot; which Mr. Haggard displays&quot;.

In the process, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; created a new genre known as the &quot;Lost World&quot;, which inspired Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;The Land That Time Forgot&quot;, Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World&quot;, Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; and H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;. In &quot;The Return of Tarzan&quot; (1913), Edgar Rice Burroughs introduced his own lost city of &quot;Opar&quot; (supposedly the same as the Biblical Ophir with which King Solomon traded), in which the influence of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; is evident. Opar reappeared in further Tarzan novels and was later taken up in the Khokarsa novels of Philip José Farmer and various derivative works in other media. Burroughs also introduced other lost cities in various hidden corners of Africa for Tarzan to visit, such as a valley in Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle inhabited by stray Crusaders still maintaining a medieval way of life. Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Conan the Barbarian also visited several lost cities, and Lee Falk&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom&quot; was initially written in this genre. A much later Lost World novel is Michael Crichton&#x27;s &quot;Congo&quot;, which is set in the 1970s and features characters seeking a trove of diamonds in the lost city of Zinj for use in electronic components rather than jewellery. The last sentence in &quot;Congo&quot; reads: “The projected intersection point now marked a field of black quatermain lava with an average depth of eight hundred meters—nearly half a mile-over the Lost City of Zinj.” The name “Quatermain” is sufficiently close to the geological term “Quaternary” that some readers, to be sure, would have missed the homage.

As in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, the narrator of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; tells his tale in the first person, in an easy conversational style. Almost entirely missing (except in the speech of the Kukuanas) is the ornate language usually associated with novels of this era. Haggard&#x27;s use of the first-person subjective perspective also contrasts with the omniscient third-person viewpoint then in vogue among influential writers such as Anthony Trollope, Thomas Hardy, and George Eliot.

The book has scholarly value for the colonialist attitudes that Haggard expresses, and for the way that he portrays the relationships between the white and African characters. Haggard portrays some African characters, such as Twala and Gagool, as barbarians but their barbarity has more to do with their roles as antagonists in the story than with their African heritage. He also presents the other side of the coin, showing some black Africans (such as Ignosi) as heroes and heroines, and shows respect for their culture. The book expresses much less prejudice than some of the later books in this genre. Indeed, Quatermain stated that he refused to use the word &quot;nigger&quot; and that many Africans are more worthy of the title of &quot;gentleman&quot; than the Europeans who settle or adventure in the country. Haggard even included an interracial romance between a Kukuana woman, Foulata, and the white Englishman Captain Good. The narrator tries to discourage the relationship, dreading the uproar that such a marriage would cause back home; however, he has no objection to the lady, whom he considers very beautiful and noble. Haggard eventually kills off Foulata, who dies in Good&#x27;s arms.

Kukuanaland is said in the book to be forty leagues north of the Lukanga river, in modern-day Zambia, which would place it in the extreme southeast of the present Democratic Republic of Congo. The culture of the Kukuanas shares many attributes with the Zulus, such as the Zulu language being spoken and the kraal system being used.

==Adaptations in other media==
===Films===
The novel has been adapted to film at least seven times. The first cinema adaptation (a silent film version) was directed by Horace Lisle Lucoque in 1919 (now lost), followed by the first sound version in 1937, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, which was directed by Robert Stevenson. The best known version premiered in 1950, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton, which was followed by a sequel, &quot;Watusi&quot; (1959). In 1979, a low-budget version was directed by Alvin Rakoff, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, combining both &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; as well as &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; in one story. The 1985 film, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, was a more tongue-in-cheek parody of the story, followed by a sequel in the same vein: &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot; (1987). Around the same period, an Australian animated TV film came out, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;. In December 2006, the movie, &quot;The Librarian: Return to King Solomon’s Mines&quot; was released as the second in a trilogy that follows one man’s fantastical adventures. In 2008, a direct-to-video adaptation, &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls&quot; was released by Mark Atkins, which bore more resemblance to Indiana Jones than the novel.

===Comics===

* In 1951, Avon Periodicals published a comic book adaptation.
* In 1952, a comic adaptation was published in &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; #97, scripted by Kenneth W. Fitch and with drawings by H. C. Kiefer.
* In 1954, British comics artist Dudley D. Watkins adapted the story into a text comics series.
* In 2015, artist Pablo Marcos and writer Mark Ellis reimagined &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; as a graphic novel published by Ying Ko Graphics.

===Television programs===

In 2002, a documentary was made by National Geographic Television in collaboration with Channel 4 in the UK: &quot;The Search for King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, a two-part TV mini-series starring Patrick Swayze as Allan Quatermain, aired on the Hallmark Channel.

===Radio===
Kenneth Colley starred as Allan Quatermain in a 1990 BBC Radio 4 adaptation.

A two-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation was broadcast in April 2017 starring Tim McInnerny as Allan Quatermain.

&quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; was the sixth episode of &quot;The General Mills Radio Adventure Theater&quot;, broadcast on 20 February 1977.

<text>Under the Ancien Régime, the Kingdom of France was subdivided in multiple different ways (judicial, military, ecclesiastical, etc.) into several administrative units, until the National Constituent Assembly adopted a more uniform division into departments (&quot;départements&quot;) and districts in late 1789. The provinces () continued to exist administratively until 21 September 1791.

The country was subdivided ecclesiastically into dioceses, judicially into &quot;généralités&quot;, militarily into general governments. None of these entities was called &quot;province&quot; by their contemporaries. However, later interpretations confused the term of &quot;general government&quot; (a military division) with that of a cultural province, since the general governments often used the names and borders of a province. It was not always the case, which causes confusion as to the borders of some provinces.

Today, the term &quot;province&quot; is used to name the resulting regional areas, which retain a cultural and linguistic identity.

Borrowed from the institutions of the Roman Empire, the word first appeared in the 15th century and has continued to spread, both in official documents and in popular or common usage. Whatever the century or dictionary consulted, the definition of the word often remains vague, due to the coexistence of several territorial division systems under the Ancien Régime. Some geographers, even some of the most famous, such as Onésime Reclus, have widely criticised the idea of provinces and provincial identity, sometimes denying that the word covers any tangible reality. In fact, the many lists and maps showing the provinces of France are neither perfectly superimposable nor exactly comparable. The fact remains, however, that the names of many of the territorial subdivisions of the Ancien Régime refer to Gallic civitates.

Before the French Revolution, France was made up of territorial divisions resulting from history, geography and settlement, which differed according to the different powers that were exercised there, with different categories such as metropolises, dioceses, duchies, baronies, governments, states, elections, generalities, intendances, parliaments, countries, bailliages, seneschaussées, etc. Each of these categories took the name of a province, without covering the same geographical area. For example, the jurisdiction of the parlement d&#x27;Artois did not correspond to the same territory as the gouvernement d&#x27;Artois or the intendance d&#x27;Artois.

The Constituent Assembly of 1789, having abolished all the rights and customs specific to the different regions (also known as privileges, such as those of the classes, nobility and clergy) during the night of 4 August, decided to establish a uniform division of the territory, the départements, and that this division would be the same for the different functions of the State: military, religious, fiscal, administrative, university, judicial, etc. The town chosen as the capital of each department would have to be the seat of each of these functions, and at the same time have a prefecture, a court, a university, a military post, a bishopric, a stock exchange, a fair, a hospital, etc. The protests of the towns which had always fulfilled one of these functions and which were thus deprived of their court of appeal, their arsenal, their university or their fair, prevented this plan from being completely implemented.

In some cases, modern regions share names with the historic provinces; their borders may cover roughly the same territory.

== History and preceding divisions ==

=== Gallish &quot;civitates&quot; ===

Gaul was occupied by fifty-four main peoples and more than a hundred individual peoples (300 according to Flavius Josephus), some with very different customs. Julius Caesar called each of these independent states &quot;civitas&quot; (city, without the word in this case referring to the idea of town or village), some of which were subdivided into &quot;pagi&quot;. Many of the smaller Gallic peoples were &quot;clients&quot; of their neighbors, and therefore dependent on them, sometimes paying them tribute. These confederations, the best-known of which are those of the Arverni, Aedui and Armoricans, formed a kind of province before Roman reorganization.

The Gallic cities, with their territory and the name given to their chief town, became dioceses under the Lower Empire; their status as &quot;mainmorte&quot;, having escaped the division of patrimonial domains, explains why they remained almost intact until the end of the Ancien Régime. These divisions were subsequently taken over and partly regrouped to form the generalités, then the départements, but replacing their former ethnic names (e.g. Poitou for the country of Pictons, Auvergne for the country of Arverni, Rouergue for the country of Ruteni, Périgord for country of Pétrocores, etc.) with a physical geographic name (giving respectively the départements of Vienne, Puy-de-Dôme, Aveyron, Dordogne, etc.).

=== Roman provinces ===
The Latin etymology of the term provincia gives us an idea of its original meaning: &quot;pro vincere&quot;, conquered in advance. Each of Gaul&#x27;s Roman provinces had a precise legal definition, clearly defined boundaries and codified administrative structures. The number of provinces, their organization and boundaries varied widely over the course of five centuries, and each was headed by a proconsul or propraetor. In addition to Provincia (Provence), which was already Roman, Caesar divided Gaul into three provinces: Aquitanica, Celtica and Belgica. Over the course of four centuries of Roman control, the number of provinces increased from three to eleven, due to both the expansion of the empire and the reduction in size of the original provinces: 1st and 2nd Germania, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Lugdunensis, 1st and 2nd Aquitanica, 1st and 2nd Belgica, 1st and 2nd Narbonensis, Novempopulanie, Sequanorum, Viennensis, Alpes Cottiarum, Alpes Maritimae, Alpes Graiae et Poeninae. These provinces were subdivided into cities (civitas or civitates in the plural), the number of which rose from 33 to 113.

== Ecclesiastical provinces and dioceses ==
Metropolises are territories under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan archbishop, also known as provinces because they originate from the Roman provinces administered by the first bishops after the fall of the Roman Empire.

They are made up of the dioceses which, by the same process, succeeded the ancient civitas or romanized Gallic cities, and which almost always retained the name of an ancient Gallic people, also given to the diocesan capital. Dioceses were made up of parishes, groups of inhabitants who could gather in the same church, whose names and boundaries have been preserved in the 36,000 French communes.

Ecclesiastical districts, by virtue of their mainmortal status, are the oldest and most stable territorial circumscriptions, from late antiquity to the general reorganization of 1802. Today, these 130 or so districts are grouped into the 90 départements and their capital cities, although their ethnonyms have been replaced by names related to physical geography: rivers, mountains, coasts.

== Judicial provinces: parliaments, bailiwicks, and seneschalties ==
Depending on their laws, customs and languages, the territory of the kingdom is divided into countries of &quot;written law&quot; (roughly south of a line from La Rochelle to Geneva) and countries of customary law (north of the same line).

Each of these groups includes several parliaments, which are appeal courts whose jurisdictions form as many judicial provinces, and to which belong all the royal jurisdictions, baillages (bailiwicks) and seneschaussées (seneschalties). They are made up of several &quot;countries&quot;, each corresponding to a general custom, or even a particular custom corresponding to former vici that have retained local customs. For example, the seneschalty of Quercy is made up of five secondary bailiwicks, corresponding to five former vigueries.

== Fiscal provinces: generalities ==
Some authors attempt to equate the concept of province with that of generality. The concepts do occasionally coincide, when the extent of a generality more or less overlaps that of an older territorial entity, but they are not synonymous.

== Military provinces: general governments ==
These are the fiefs that depend directly on the crown (duchies, counties and marches) and owe it military aid.

In addition to the Duchy of France, which became part of the royal domain, the first six major fiefs have the title of peerage:

* The three duchies of Aquitaine or Guyenne, Burgundy and Normandy,
* The three counties of Toulouse, Flanders and Champagne (circa 1212).

Their holders were considered electors of the King of France, along with six other ecclesiastical peers:

* The three bishop-dukes of Reims, Laon and Langres,

* The three bishop-counts of Beauvais, Châlons and Noyon (of Merovingian origin).

The number of grand fiefs varies with history (inheritances, confiscations, conquests, losses, treaties) and increases with the definitive attachment of the County of Provence, the Duchy of Anjou, the Duchy of Burgundy, the Duchy of Brittany, the Duchy of Lorraine, and so on. Some of these provinces were simply the return to the crown of a former fiefdom, such as the Duchy of Burgundy, which had been held by Hugues Capet&#x27;s brother. Others, such as the Duchy of Savoy, Corsica, Comtat-Vénessin and the County of Nice, were acquired from the Empire or the Holy See.

Unlike the ecclesiastical provinces, their extent varies over the course of history according to the possessions of their holders, or to political reorganizations. For example, the Duchy of Gascony disappeared in the 11th century, and the Duchy of Normandy was divided into two military governments.

In modern times, the &quot;thirty-six governments&quot; corresponded to the provinces on which all the fiefs and arrière-fiefs depended, providing territorial districts for defense and marshaling, the raising of men-at-arms, the construction of squares, arsenals and castles, judges-at-arms, and therefore also all questions of nobility, armorial bearings, etc.

At the end of the Ancien Régime, not counting overseas territories such as the French islands of America, Pondicherry, Mauritius or New France (a province from 1663 to 1763, when it was ceded to Great Britain and Spain), there were thirty-six regions with a governor in charge of defense, called governments. Each had its own nobility.

Together with the regions attached to France since 1791, these thirty-six governments correspond to what are usually known today as the &quot;former provinces of France&quot;.

=== List of former general governments of France ===
The list below shows the major provinces of France at the time of their dissolution during the French Revolution. Capital cities are shown in parentheses. Bold indicates a city that was also the seat of a judicial and quasi-legislative body called either a &quot;parlement&quot; (not to be confused with a parliament) or a &quot;conseil souverain&quot; (sovereign council). In some cases, this body met in a different city from the capital.

<text>Rayleigh fading is a statistical model for the effect of a propagation environment on a radio signal, such as that used by wireless devices.

Rayleigh fading models assume that the magnitude of a signal that has passed through such a transmission medium (also called a communication channel) will vary randomly, or fade, according to a Rayleigh distribution — the radial component of the sum of two uncorrelated Gaussian random variables.

Rayleigh fading is viewed as a reasonable model for tropospheric and ionospheric signal propagation as well as the effect of heavily built-up urban environments on radio signals. Rayleigh fading is most applicable when there is no dominant propagation along a line of sight between the transmitter and receiver. If there is a dominant line of sight, Rician fading may be more applicable. Rayleigh fading is a special case of two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading.

==The model==
Rayleigh fading is a reasonable model when there are many objects in the environment that scatter the radio signal before it arrives at the receiver. The central limit theorem holds that, if there is sufficiently much scatter, the channel impulse response will be well-modelled as a Gaussian process irrespective of the distribution of the individual components. If there is no dominant component to the scatter, then such a process will have zero mean and phase evenly distributed between 0 and 2π radians. The envelope of the channel response will therefore be Rayleigh distributed.

Calling this random variable formula_1, it will have a probability density function:
:formula_2
where formula_3.

Often, the gain and phase elements of a channel&#x27;s distortion are conveniently represented as a complex number. In this case, Rayleigh fading is exhibited by the assumption that the real and imaginary parts of the response are modelled by independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian processes so that the amplitude of the response is the sum of two such processes.

===Applicability===

The requirement that there be many scatterers present means that Rayleigh fading can be a useful model in heavily built-up city centres where there is no line of sight between the transmitter and receiver and many buildings and other objects attenuate, reflect, refract, and diffract the signal. Experimental work in Manhattan has found near-Rayleigh fading there. In tropospheric and ionospheric signal propagation the many particles in the atmospheric layers act as scatterers and this kind of environment may also approximate Rayleigh fading. If the environment is such that, in addition to the scattering, there is a strongly dominant signal seen at the receiver, usually caused by a line of sight, then the mean of the random process will no longer be zero, varying instead around the power-level of the dominant path. Such a situation may be better modelled as Rician fading.

Note that Rayleigh fading is a small-scale effect. There will be bulk properties of the environment such as path loss and shadowing upon which the fading is superimposed.

How rapidly the channel fades will be affected by how fast the receiver and/or transmitter are moving. Motion causes Doppler shift in the received signal components. The figures show the power variation over 1 second of a constant signal after passing through a single-path Rayleigh fading channel with a maximum Doppler shift of 10 Hz and 100 Hz. These Doppler shifts correspond to velocities of about 6 km/h (4 mph) and 60 km/h (40 mph) respectively at 1800 MHz, one of the operating frequencies for GSM mobile phones. This is the classic shape of Rayleigh fading. Note in particular the &#x27;deep fades&#x27; where signal strength can drop by a factor of several thousand, or 30–40 dB.

==Properties==
Since it is based on a well-studied distribution with special properties, the Rayleigh distribution lends itself to analysis, and the key features that affect the performance of a wireless network have analytic expressions.

Note that the parameters discussed here are for a non-static channel. If a channel is not changing with time, it does not fade and instead remains at some particular level. Separate instances of the channel in this case will be uncorrelated with one another, owing to the assumption that each of the scattered components fades independently. Once relative motion is introduced between any of the transmitter, receiver, and scatterers, the fading becomes correlated and varying in time.

===Level crossing rate===
The level crossing rate is a measure of the rapidity of the fading. It quantifies how often the fading crosses some threshold, usually in the positive-going direction. For Rayleigh fading, the level crossing rate is:
:formula_4
where formula_5 is the maximum Doppler shift and formula_6 is the threshold level normalised to the root mean square (RMS) signal level:
:formula_7

===Average fade duration===
The average fade duration quantifies how long the signal spends below the threshold formula_6. For Rayleigh fading, the average fade duration is:
:formula_9

The level crossing rate and average fade duration taken together give a useful means of characterizing the severity of the fading over time.

For a particular normalized threshold value formula_10, the product of the average fade duration and the level crossing rate is a constant and is given by

:formula_11

===Doppler power spectral density===

The Doppler power spectral density of a fading channel describes how much spectral broadening it causes. This shows how a pure frequency, e.g., a pure sinusoid, which is an impulse in the frequency domain, is spread out across frequency when it passes through the channel. It is the Fourier transform of the time-autocorrelation function. For Rayleigh fading with a vertical receive antenna with equal sensitivity in all directions, this has been shown to be:

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the frequency shift relative to the carrier frequency. This equation is valid only for values of formula_13 between formula_15; the spectrum is zero outside this range. This spectrum is shown in the figure for a maximum Doppler shift of 10 Hz. The &#x27;bowl shape&#x27; or &#x27;bathtub shape&#x27; is the classic form of this Doppler spectrum.

==Generating Rayleigh fading==
As described above, a Rayleigh fading channel itself can be modelled by generating the real and imaginary parts of a complex number according to independent normal Gaussian variables. However, it is sometimes the case that it is simply the amplitude fluctuations that are of interest (such as in the figure shown above). There are two main approaches to this. In both cases, the aim is to produce a signal that has the Doppler power spectrum given above and the equivalent autocorrelation properties.

===Jakes&#x27;s model===
In his book, Jakes popularised a model for Rayleigh fading based on summing sinusoids. Let the scatterers be uniformly distributed around a circle at angles formula_16 with formula_17 rays emerging from each scatterer. The Doppler shift on ray formula_18 is
:formula_19
and, with formula_20 such scatterers, the Rayleigh fading of the formula_21 waveform over time formula_22 can be modelled as:

: formula_23

Here, formula_24 and the formula_25 and formula_26 are model parameters with formula_24 usually set to zero, formula_25 chosen so that there is no cross-correlation between the real and imaginary parts of formula_29:
:formula_30
and formula_26 used to generate multiple waveforms. If a single-path channel is being modelled, so that there is only one waveform then formula_32 can be zero. If a multipath, frequency-selective channel is being modelled so that multiple waveforms are needed, Jakes suggests that uncorrelated waveforms are given by

:formula_33

In fact, it has been shown that the waveforms are correlated among themselves — they have non-zero cross-correlation — except in special circumstances. The model is also deterministic (it has no random element to it once the parameters are chosen). A modified Jakes&#x27;s model chooses slightly different spacings for the scatterers and scales their waveforms using Walsh–Hadamard sequences to ensure zero cross-correlation. Setting

:formula_34

results in the following model, usually termed the Dent model or the modified Jakes model:

: formula_35

The weighting functions formula_36 are the formula_17th Walsh–Hadamard sequence in formula_18. Since these have zero cross-correlation by design, this model results in uncorrelated waveforms. The phases formula_32 can be initialised randomly and have no effect on the correlation properties. The fast Walsh transform can be used to efficiently generate samples using this model.

The Jakes&#x27;s model also popularised the Doppler spectrum associated with Rayleigh fading, and, as a result, this Doppler spectrum is often termed Jakes&#x27;s spectrum.

===Filtered white noise===
Another way to generate a signal with the required Doppler power spectrum is to pass a white Gaussian noise signal through a Gaussian filter with a frequency response equal to the square-root of the Doppler spectrum required. Although simpler than the models above, and non-deterministic, it presents some implementation questions related to needing high-order filters to approximate the irrational square-root function in the response and sampling the Gaussian waveform at an appropriate rate.

===Butterworth filter as Doppler power spectral density===

According to Doppler PSD can also be modeled via Butterworth filter as:

:formula_40

where &quot;f&quot; is a frequency, formula_41 is the Butterworth filter response, &quot;B&quot; is the normalization constant, &quot;k&quot; is the filter order and formula_42 is the Cutoff frequency which should be selected with respect to maximum Doppler shift.

<text>Crotone (; ; or ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in Calabria, Italy. 

Founded as the Achaean colony of Kroton ( or ; ), it became a great Greek city, home of the renowned mathematician-philosopher Pythagoras amongst other famous citizens, and one of the most important centres of Magna Graecia. 

It was known as Cotrone from the Middle Ages until 1928, when its name was changed to the current one. In 1992, it became the capital of the newly established Province of Crotone.

==History==

The promontory of Kroton was inhabited by indigenous populations, perhaps Oenotrians and Japigi, in the Bronze Age and early Iron Age. 

===Foundation===

Kroton&#x27;s &quot;oikistes&quot; (founder) was Myscellus, from the city of Rhypes in Achaea in the northern Peloponnese, after consulting the Delphic Oracle who announced:

:&quot;Cross the vast sea and next to the Esaro (river) you will found Kroton.&quot;

The Achaeans were motivated, like others of the Greek colonisation, by the lack of cultivatable land in their mountainous region and by population pressure.

Although the Greek foundation of Kroton was thought to be 710 BC, it is likely that Myscellus made three founding expeditions to Kroton, the first in ca. 733 in the company of Archias of Corinth at the head of an Achaean-Spartan venture (when they founded Syracuse), but which did not result in a stable urban settlement. The second was in 720-709 at the head of an Achaean colonial expedition, hoping to settle in the Sybaris area. The third time in ca. 708 when, at the head of a similar expedition, he founded Kroton.

Archaeology has shown that colonisation in the second half of the 8th century BC had an impact on the settlement organisation and on the economic and social structure of the indigenous communities: in the Kroton area most of the existing settlements disappeared, while grave goods from the Carrara necropolis highlight a widespread practice of mixed marriages between Greeks and indigenous women, since the first generation of settlers.

===Greek era===

It soon became one of the most flourishing cities of Magna Graecia reaching a population between 50,000 and 80,000 around 500 BC. During its early history Croton expanded its influence over the Bruttian peninsula founding possibly Caulonia in the second half of the 7th century BC.

The victory of Locri and Rhegium over Croton in the battle of the Sagra in middle of the sixth century BC interrupted the expansion of the city.

The walls of the city were 12 miles long and enclosed a vast area. 

Its inhabitants were famous for their physical strength and for the simple sobriety of their lives. From 588 BC onwards, Croton produced many generations of winners in the Olympics and the other Panhellenic Games, the most famous of whom was Milo of Croton. The physicians of Croton were considered the foremost among the Greeks, and among them Democedes, son of Calliphon, was the most prominent in the 6th century BC. Accordingly, he travelled around Greece and ended up working in the court of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos. After the tyrant was murdered, Democedes was captured by the Persians and brought to King Darius, curing him of a dislocated ankle. Democedes&#x27; fame was, according to Herodotus, the basis for the prestige of Croton&#x27;s physicians.

Croton formed a league with Sybaris against Siris and in the war that ensued after 550 BC Siris was destroyed.

Pythagoras founded his school at Croton c. 530 BC. Among his pupils were the early medical theorist Alcmaeon of Croton and the philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer Philolaus. The Pythagoreans acquired considerable influence with the supreme council of one thousand by which the city was ruled. 

Sybaris started to become the rival of Croton under the influence of the Pythagoreans who disliked excess, until 510 BC when Sybaris was shaken by various political events leading to the rule of the tyrant Telys. Many aristocrats were forced to flee to Croton and when Telys asked them to hand over the Sybarite exiles, the Crotonians refused and Sybaris began the war. Croton sent an army of 100,000 men commanded by the wrestler Milo against Sybaris and destroyed it. As a consequence, Croton became the capital of a confederation including the 25 city-states in the region of Sybaris, as shown by numerous coins minted between 480 and 460 BC.

In 480 BC, Croton sent a ship led by the famous athlete Phayllos and armed at his own expense in support of the Greeks at the Battle of Salamis, the only one from the Italian coast. Half of a stone anchor block bearing his name was found at Capo Cimiti and currently preserved in the Museum of Capo Colonna.

It founded the colony of Terina on the Tyrrhenian coast in 480–470 BC. 

Shortly afterwards, however, a bloody revolt led by the oligarch Cylon, during which many Pythagoreans were massacred and Pythagoras himself had to flee to Metapontum, led to the Pythagoreans being driven out and a democracy established. At the same time, other similar governments also fell and there were massacres and persecutions of Pythagoreans in all the Italian &quot;poleis&quot;.

Croton then experienced a period of decline. Around this time the Italiote league was founded to defend itself from the expansionist aims of Syracuse and from attacks by the Lucanians, with Croton as the hegemon of the league. The meeting place for the league was the Sanctuary of Hera Lacinia at Capo Collone 10 km away, which was also used as the federal treasury of the league. The decline was followed by general anarchy, not only in Croton but also in other cities. The intervention of Achaeans brought a truce to the anarchy and the colonies adopted the laws of their original homeland. This calm lasted until Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, aiming at hegemony in Magna Graecia, captured Croton in 379 BC and held it for twelve years. Croton was then occupied by the Bruttii, with the exception of the citadel, in which the chief inhabitants had taken refuge; these soon after surrendered and were allowed to withdraw to Locri.

In 295 BC, Croton fell to another Syracusan tyrant, Agathocles. When Pyrrhus invaded Italy (280–278, 275 BC), it was still a considerable city, with twelve miles () of walls, but after the Pyrrhic War, half the town was deserted.

===Roman era===

What was left of its population submitted to Rome in 277 BC. After the Battle of Cannae in the Second Punic War (216 BC), Croton was betrayed to the Brutii by a democratic leader named Aristomachus, who defected to the Roman side. Hannibal made it his winter quarters for three years, and the city was not recaptured until 205 or 204 BC after the Battles of Croton.

In 194 BC, it became the site of a Roman colony. Little more is heard of it during the Republican and Imperial periods, though the action of one of the more significant surviving fragments of the &quot;Satyricon&quot; of Petronius is set in Croton, where he mentions the corrupt morals of its inhabitants.

===Post-Roman era===

Around 550 AD, the city was unsuccessfully besieged by Totila, king of the Ostrogoths. At a later date it became a part of the Byzantine Empire. Around 841, the Republic of Venice sent a fleet of 60 galleys (each carrying 200 men) to assist the Byzantines in driving the Arabs from Crotone, but it failed. 

About 870, it was sacked by the Saracens, who put to death the bishop and many people who had taken refuge in the cathedral but were not able to occupy the city. Over a hundred years later, Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor, mounted a campaign in southern Italy to reduce the power of the Byzantines. Later, Crotone was conquered by the Normans. 

In 1806, it was occupied and sacked by the British, and later by the French. Thereafter it shared the fate of the Kingdom of Naples, including the period of Spanish rule of which the 16th-century castle of Charles V, overlooking modern Crotone, serves as a reminder. Its successor, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was conquered by the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860 and incorporated into the new Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

===Modern era===

Crotone&#x27;s location between the ports of Taranto and Messina, as well as its proximity to a source of hydroelectric power, favoured industrial development during the period between the two World Wars. In the 1930s its population doubled. However, after the two main employers, Pertusola Sud and Montedison, collapsed by the late 1980s, Crotone was in economic crisis, with many residents losing their jobs and leaving to find work elsewhere. In 1996, the river Esaro flooded the city, which dealt a further blow to the city&#x27;s morale. Since that low point, the city has undergone urban renewal and risen in quality-of-life rankings.

==Archaeology==
===The city walls===

The overall layout of the ancient wall circuit of Kroton was reconstructed by archaeology in recent decades. It descends from the St. Lucia hill to the nearby Carrara hill from where it headed north-west towards the Cimone Rapignese on which, at 40 m above sea level, traces of wall have been found, and from here it crossed the Esaro river. On St. Lucia hill material had been reused which confirms that it had been built or rebuilt after of Dionysius&#x27; siege. The archaeological data give a city area of at least 617 hectares which may not have been entirely occupied by buildings and may not originally have been entirely surrounded by walls. 

A stretch near the river brought to light in 1978 was also described by Paolo Orsi at the beginning of the century. Also of notable importance are the sections on the &quot;Vigna Nuova&quot; hill and in the water collector of the industrial area of the Papaniciaro stream, where a large fragment was found with a double facing in opus quadratum and emplecton, dating to the mid-4th century BC.

From excavations carried out from 1975 the line of the Hellenistic walls was completed going up Battery hill and descending by the Pertusola factory towards the sea.

===Urban excavations===

Urban excavations between from 1975 have considerably expanded knowledge of the history of the settlement. As on all sites where modern cities are built over ancient towns, archaeological research is limited. The data seems to confirm the contemporary occupation of the whole walled area by reasonably close nuclei, between the hill of the Castle and that of the Battery, and northwards beyond the river Esaro, in an area still unoccupied by the modern town. The urban layout has emerged with a sequence of superimpositions throughout the life of the colony, datable between the end of the 7th and start of the 6th century BC. Three large urban blocks have been identified, organised with an orthogonal network of narrow streets (stenopoi) and streets between individual houses (ambitus). Numerous houses, both of residential nature and mixed house-artisan workshops, have been excavated, as have furnaces and shops specialising in pottery products, areas of necropolis of Hellenistic date. The construction techniques were functional and economical, generally using roughly cut stone, typical of the archaic age. To prevent the deterioration of the lower part of the walls due to rain water, stone footings were additionally protected by tiles or pieces of pithoi (large pottery vessels). 

Prior to the construction of a new school in Acquabona di Crotone an excavation over a larger area has recently been possible. Two stenopoi about 5 m wide run across it on an alignment of + 30° E.

The discovery of a building in 2010 dating to the Republican age in Via Discesa Fosso indicated the possibility of locating of the Roman colony in the acropolis. The building had painted plaster in Pompeian style with tiled and marble floors.

An important &quot;domus&quot; found in Discesa Fosso includes baths and indicates a Roman-era &quot;neighbourhood&quot; which may have been distinguished from the rest of the Roman town by its secluded position of absolute prestige. It seems that it also had a small service port for the domus, perhaps a breakwater built to protect the port from which the Krotonian aristocrats during the second Punic war, having descended from the upper part of the city, embarked for Locri. Perhaps it is the Krotonian port mentioned by Cicero that determined the location of the colony as overlapping with the Greek polis.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Crotone enjoys a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;).
===Main sights===
*The Cathedral, originally from the 9th to 11th centuries, but largely rebuilt. It has a neo-classical façade, while the interior has a nave with two aisles, with Baroque decorations. Noteworthy are a baptismal font (12th century) and the &quot;Madonna di Capo Colonna&quot;, the icon of the Black Madonna which, according to the tradition, was brought from East in the first years of the Christian era.
*The 16th-century Castle of Charles V. It houses the Town Museum, with findings excavated in the ancient site of Croton. Notable are also the remnants of the walls, of the same century, and of various watchtowers.
*The ancient castle built on an island, with accessibility on foot limited to a narrow strip of land, is referred to as &quot;Le Castella&quot;.
== Government ==
==Transportation==

Crotone Airport (Sant&#x27;Anna Airport) is served by Italiatour.it and other charter airlines. Crotone also has a railway station, although much of the tourism traffic is served by the Salerno-Reggio Calabria highway and the National Road (called 106 Ionica) leading all the Jonic (eastern) coast from Taranto to Reggio Calabria.
In recent times, Crotone Port has been used by visitors on yacht charter cruising vacations.

== Culture ==
===Museums===

Crotone hosts a national archaeological museum, a municipal museum, a municipal art gallery, and a provincial museum of contemporary art, as well as the Antiquarium di Torre Nao.
*National Archaeological Museum: founded in 1968, it is located on Risorgimento street, in the heart of the historic city center. The building consists of two floors and contains all of the most significant finds from the archaeological sites of the entire territory Crotone. In particular rich archaeological finds come from the Sanctuary of Hera Lacinia site in Capo Colonna.

===Sport===
F.C. Crotone is a football club in Serie C. The team was promoted to top flight Serie A for the first time in its history for the 2016–17 season, and after one year in Serie B, was again promoted to play in Serie A for the 2020–21 season.

Achei Crotone is an American football club in Italy&#x27;s 3rd division. It was established in 1989 and is considered one of the most storied teams in Italy.

===Сhurches===
Church of the Immaculate Conception: the original construction of the Cathedral dates back to the 9th century. Initially it was dedicated to St. Dionysius, and later, around 1462–1463, to the Assumption of Saint Mary into heaven. During the centuries, the church was subject to various restoration, although in the 16th century the bishop A. Lucifero undertook its complete reconstruction, using materials removed from the ancient temple of Hera Lacinia. The interior of the church has three naves divided by pillars.

The Cathedral: in 1686, as attested by an existing marble plaque in the current church, on the old oratory a church was built and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary by a group of lay people who had decided to give birth to a lay congregation in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Souls in Purgatory, which was also called (&quot;The Congregation of the Plebeians&quot;).
The façade, which recalls in its features the sober and austere neoclassical style setting, is a harmonious and unifying element. It has a portal with a single architrave, surmounted by a stained glass window, depicting the Virgin, and two niches with statues, all topped by a triangular gable and side pinnacles.

===Literary reference===
Crotone appears in the Philippine national epic &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; as the Kingdom of &quot;Krotona&quot;. The poem narrates this as the homeland of the protagonist Florante&#x27;s mother, Princess Floresca.

In Petronius&#x27; Satyricon, which survives in fragments, the narrator and his friends arrive at Croton, famous for its legacy hunters. The narrator&#x27;s companion, the manic poet Eumolpus, poses as a childless, rich old man. Upon arrival to the city, Philomela, a citizen of Croton, seduces Eumolpus by means of her children. The extant portion of the Satyricon ends with Eumolpus explaining that the people of Croton must agree to eat his dead body if they wish to claim his inheritance.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – sister cities===

* Giannitsa, Macedonia, Greece, since 2010
* Porto, Norte, Portugal, since 2010

<doc id="81185" wikidata="Q466895" url="?curid=81185" title="Lowell Observatory">
<text>Lowell Observatory is an astronomical observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, United States. Lowell Observatory was established in 1894, placing it among the oldest observatories in the United States, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. In 2011, the Observatory was named one of &quot;The World&#x27;s 100 Most Important Places&quot; by Time Magazine. It was at the Lowell Observatory that the dwarf planet Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh.

The observatory was founded by astronomer Percival Lowell of Boston&#x27;s Lowell family and is overseen by a sole trustee, a position historically handed down through the family. The first trustee was Lowell&#x27;s third cousin Guy Lowell (1916–1927). Percival&#x27;s nephew Roger Putnam served from 1927 to 1967, followed by Roger&#x27;s son Michael (1967–1987), Michael&#x27;s brother William Lowell Putnam III (1987–2013), and current trustee W. Lowell Putnam.

Multiple astronauts attended the Lowell Observatory in 1963 while the moon was being mapped for the Apollo Program.

==History==

In 1877 the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli purported to have discovered a series of martian canals. Percival Lowell had seen these drawings and was fascinated by the idea of artificial canals in Mars. In the winter of 1893, he devoted to use his wealth and connections to establish an observatory in the US. His wealth stemmed from his connection to the influential Boston Lowell family and his successful career as an investment banker. Lowell hired American astronomer Andrew E. Douglas to find a suitable location for the observatory and in 1894 they agreed to build it in Flagstaff, Arizona due to its elevation, dark night skies, and proximity to the railroad. The materials for the construction of the observatory were all sourced locally, but the Clark Refracting Telescope was assembled in Boston.

The observatory has carried out a wide array of research. One of its programs was the measurement of the variability of solar irradiance. When Harold L. Johnson took over as the director in 1952, the stated objective became to focus on light from the Sun reflecting from Uranus and Neptune. In 1953, the current telescope was erected. Beginning in 1954, this telescope began monitoring the brightness of these two planets, and comparing these measurements with a reference set of Sun-like stars.

Self-taught astronomer Robert Burnham Jr. was an employee at Lowell observatory from 1958 to 1979, being known for his &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot;.

Beginning in 2012, Lowell Observatory began offering camps for children known as LOCKs (Lowell Observatory Camps for Kids). The first camp was established for elementary students. Later on, in 2013, they added an additional camp program for preschool children. The following year they added another program for middle school students. (&quot;Kelly&quot;, Manager at Lowell Observatory). Kids have the opportunity to learn hands-on about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through a variety of activities that include games, experiments, story time, art, music, and more.

In 2016, Kevin Schindler published &quot;Lowell Observatory&quot;, a 128-page book containing over 200 captions and pictures. Arcadia Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Images of America&quot; included it in their series, which increased the enthusiasm of space in the public. The book itself features the popular reputation of Lowell Observatory, encompassing the revolutionary research of scientists and how they contributed to the field of astronomy. 

== Exhibits ==
* The Rotunda Museum: Built in 1916, it is used by the observatory as a library and collection area for artifacts. It features displays that discuss the Lowell family history and the discoveries made at the observatory. It also houses many different measuring tools including Thatcher&#x27;s Calculating Instrument.
* Putnam Collection Center/ Lowell&#x27;s Lunar Legacy: When the Rotunda Museum is closed, the Putnam Collection Center and Lowell&#x27;s Lunar Legacy, are open to the public. The Center highlights the Observatories history and features artifacts from Lowell&#x27;s past and other scientific discoveries.
* The Giovale Open Deck Observatory: It is the newest addition to the Lowell observatory that allows guests to learn astronomy during the day and night. It features six telescopes, six plinths on the deck&#x27;s circumference, and an APS spectrum display. The six telescopes on the deck are a 5.5-inch TEC wide-field refractor, an 8-inch Moonraker Victorian refractor, a 32-inch Starstructure Dobsonian reflector, a 16-inch Meade ACF catadioptric reflector, a 17-inch PlaneWave CDK catadioptric reflector, and a 14-inch PlaneWave CDK catadioptric reflector.

=== Lowell Discovery Telescope ===

Lowell Observatory owns and operates the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT, formerly the Discovery Channel Telescope) located near Happy Jack, Arizona. This 4.3-meter reflecting telescope is the fifth-largest telescope in the contiguous United States and one of the most powerful in the world, thanks to a unique housing that can accommodate up to five instruments at the Ritchey-Chrétien focus. The LDT can switch between any of these instruments in about a minute, making it uniquely suited for time-domain programs as well as opportunity targets such as gamma ray bursts and supernovae.

The 6700-pound primary mirror measures in diameter yet only about in thickness. This finely figured, thin meniscus mirror, held in shape by a 156-element active optics system, regularly delivers sub-arcsecond seeing. The mirror was ground and polished into its hyperbolic shape at the Optical Fabrication and Engineering Facility of the College of Optical Sciences of the University of Arizona in Tucson.

The LDT is housed in a 73-foot-tall, 62-foot-diameter metal dome located at an elevation of and about southeast of Flagstaff. Groundbreaking for the facility occurred on July 11, 2005. A little over six years later, the first image from just the primary mirror was recorded, using a small test camera mounted where the secondary mirror would eventually go. The secondary mirror was installed in January 2012. To celebrate first light, Lowell hosted a gala celebration on July 21, 2012, featuring a keynote address by Neil Armstrong. This was his final public appearance before his death several weeks later.

The telescope is named for the Discovery Channel television network. Discovery founder and CEO John Hendricks has long been a member of Lowell Observatory&#x27;s Advisory Board, and Discovery and John and his wife Maureen made gifts of $16 million toward the $53 million cost of the project. These were gifts, not purchases: Discovery has no ownership in the telescope, nor any direction of the research conducted with it. In return for their contributions, they received naming rights and first right of refusal for use of images in educational broadcasts. Research use proceeds as it would at any other professional telescope.

Boston University, the University of Maryland, the University of Toledo, Northern Arizona University, and Yale University have joined Lowell as partners with access to DCT.

=== Other ===
The observatory operates several telescopes at three locations in the Flagstaff area. The main facility, located on Mars Hill just west of downtown Flagstaff, houses the original Clark Refracting Telescope, which is now used for public education, with 85,000 annual visitors. The telescope, built in 1896 for $20,000, was assembled in Boston by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons and then shipped by train to Flagstaff. Also located on the Mars Hill campus is the Pluto Discovery Telescope, used by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 to discover the dwarf planet Pluto.

In 2014, the Putnam Center was opened. This observatory included many rooms with tools that were useful to observers including a library for research, a room for processing photographic glass plates, multiple antique instruments used by previous astronomers, and many artifacts. The observatory does contain areas that are closed to the public view, although there are multiple places that tourists are welcome to visit.

Lowell Observatory currently operates four research telescopes at its Anderson Mesa dark-sky site, located southeast of Flagstaff, including the Perkins Telescope (in partnership with Boston University) and the John S. Hall Telescope. Lowell is a partner with the United States Naval Observatory and Naval Research Laboratory in the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) also located at that site. The Observatory also operates smaller research telescopes at its historic site on Mars Hill and in Australia and Chile.

Past Anderson Mesa, on the peak of Happy Jack, Lowell Observatory built the Lowell Discovery Telescope in partnership with Discovery Communications, Inc.

== Current research ==
Lowell Observatory&#x27;s astronomers conduct research on a wide range of solar system and astrophysical topics using ground-based, airborne, and space-based telescopes. Among the many current programs are a search for near-Earth asteroids, a survey of the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, a search for extrasolar planets, a decades-long study of the brightness stability of the sun, and a variety of investigations of star formation and other processes in distant galaxies. In addition, the Observatory staff designs and builds custom instrumentation for use on Lowell&#x27;s telescopes and elsewhere. For example, Lowell staff built a sophisticated high-speed camera for use on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). SOFIA is a joint project of NASA and DLR, the German space agency, and consists of a telescope on board a Boeing 747 SP.

Lowell astronomers, Nick Moskovitz, Brian Skiff, and Tom Polakis also contributed observations in NASA&#x27;s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) using both the 1.1-meter John Hall Telescope and 4.3-meter Lowell Discovery Telescope. This experiment is the world&#x27;s first full-scale planetary defense test.

<doc id="81189" wikidata="Q1147883" url="?curid=81189" title="Ruthenia">
<text>Ruthenia is an exonym, originally used in Medieval Latin, as one of several terms for Rus&#x27;. Originally, the term &quot;Rus&#x27; land&quot; referred to a triangular area, which mainly corresponds to the tribe of Polans in Dnieper Ukraine. &quot;Ruthenia&quot; was used to refer to the East Slavic and Eastern Orthodox people of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland, and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Austria-Hungary, mainly to Ukrainians and sometimes Belarusians, corresponding to the territories of modern Belarus, Ukraine, Eastern Poland and some of western Russia.
Historically, in a broader sense, the term was used to refer to all the territories under Kievan dominion (mostly East Slavs).

The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (1772–1918), corresponding to parts of Western Ukraine, was referred to as &quot;Ruthenia&quot; and its people as &quot;Ruthenians&quot;. As a result of a Ukrainian national identity gradually dominating over much of present-day Ukraine in the 19th and 20th centuries, the endonym &quot;Rusyn&quot; is now mostly used among a minority of peoples on the territory of the Carpathian Mountains, including Carpathian Ruthenia.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;Ruthenia&quot; originated as a Latin designation of the region its people called &quot;Rus&quot;&#x27;. During the Middle Ages, writers in English and other Western European languages applied the term to lands inhabited by Eastern Slavs.
&quot;Rusia&quot; or &quot;Ruthenia&quot; appears in the 1520 Latin treatise &quot;Mores, leges et ritus omnium gentium, per Ioannem Boëmum, Aubanum, Teutonicum ex multis clarissimis rerum scriptoribus collecti&quot; by Johann Boemus. In the chapter &quot;De Rusia sive Ruthenia, et recentibus Rusianorum moribus&quot; (&quot;About Rus&#x27;, or Ruthenia, and modern customs of the Rus&#x27;&quot;), Boemus tells of a country extending from the Baltic Sea to the Caspian Sea and from the Don River to the northern ocean. It is a source of beeswax, its forests harbor many animals with valuable fur, and the capital city Moscow (&quot;Moscovia&quot;), named after the Moskva River (&quot;Moscum amnem&quot;), is 14 miles in circumference.
Danish diplomat Jacob Ulfeldt, who traveled to Muscovy in 1578 to meet with Tsar Ivan IV, titled his posthumously (1608) published memoir &quot;Hodoeporicon Ruthenicum&quot;
(&quot;Voyage to Ruthenia&quot;).

==Early Middle Ages==

In Kievan Rus&#x27;, the name &quot;Rus&quot;&#x27;, or &quot;Rus&#x27;ka zemlia&quot; (land of Rus&#x27;), described the lands between Kiev, Chernihiv and Pereyaslav, corresponding to the tribe of Polanians, which started to identify themself as Rus&#x27; () approximately in 9th century.

In a broader sense, this name also referred to all territories under control of Kievan princes, and the initial area of Rus&#x27; land served as their metropole, yet this wider meaning declined when Kiev lost its power over majority of principalities. After the Mongol Invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; and a massive devastation of the core territory, the name &quot;Rus&quot;&#x27; was succeeded by Galician-Volhynian principality, which declared itself as &quot;Kingdom of Rus&#x27;&quot;.

European manuscripts dating from the 11th century used the name &quot;Ruthenia&quot; to describe Rus&#x27;, the wider area occupied by the early Rus&#x27; (commonly referred to as &quot;Kievan Rus&quot;″). This term was also used to refer to the Slavs of the island of Rügen or to other Baltic Slavs, whom 12th-century chroniclers portrayed as fierce pirate pagans—even though Kievan Rus&#x27; had converted to Christianity by the 10th century: Eupraxia, the daughter of &quot;Rutenorum rex&quot; Vsevolod I of Kiev, had married the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV in 1089. After the devastating Mongolian occupation of the main part of Ruthenia which began in the 13th century, western Ruthenian principalities became incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after which the state became called the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Ruthenia. The Polish Kingdom also took the title King of Ruthenia when it annexed Galicia. These titles were merged when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was formed. A small part of Rus&#x27; (Transcarpathia, now mainly a part of Zakarpattia Oblast in present-day Ukraine), became subordinated to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th century. The Kings of Hungary continued using the title &quot;King of Galicia and Lodomeria&quot; until 1918.

== Late Middle Ages ==

By the 15th century, the Moscow principality had established its sovereignty over a large portion of former Kievan territory and began to fight Lithuania over Ruthenian lands. In 1547, the Moscow principality adopted the title of The Great Principat of Moscow and Tsardom of the Whole Rus and claimed sovereignty over &quot;all the Rus&#x27;&quot; — acts not recognized by its neighbour Poland. The Muscovy population was Eastern Orthodox and preferred to use the Greek transliteration &quot;Rossiya&quot; (Ῥωσία) rather than the Latin &quot;Ruthenia&quot;.

In the 14th century, the southern territories of Rus&#x27;, including the principalities of Galicia–Volhynia and Kiev, became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which in 1384 united with Catholic Poland in a union which became the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569. Due to their usage of the Latin script rather than the Cyrillic script, they were usually denoted by the Latin name &quot;Ruthenia&quot;. Other spellings were also used in Latin, English, and other languages during this period. Contemporaneously, the Ruthenian Voivodeship was established in the territory of Galicia-Volhynia and existed until the 18th century.

These southern territories include:
* Galicia–Volhynia or the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia ( or ; or )
* Galicia ( or ; )
* White Ruthenia, (eastern part of modern Belarus; ; )
* Black Ruthenia (a western part of modern Belarus; )
* Galicia, or Red Ruthenia, western Ukraine and southeast Poland; (; )
* Carpathian Ruthenia (; )

The Russian Tsardom was officially called &quot;Velikoye Knyazhestvo Moskovskoye (Великое Княжество Московское),&quot; the Grand Duchy of Moscow, until 1547, although Ivan III (1440–1505, ) had earlier borne the title &quot;Great Tsar of All Russia&quot;.

==Early modern period==

During the early modern period, the term &quot;Ruthenia&quot; started to be mostly associated with the Ruthenian lands of the Polish Crown and the Cossack Hetmanate. Bohdan Khmelnytsky declared himself the ruler of &quot;the Ruthenian state&quot; to the Polish representative Adam Kysil in February 1649.

The Grand Principality of Ruthenia was the project name of the Cossack Hetmanate integrated into the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth.

== Modern period ==

=== Ukraine ===
The use of the term &quot;Rus/Russia&quot; in the lands of Rus&#x27; survived longer as a name used by Ukrainians for Ukraine. When the Austrian monarchy made the vassal state of Galicia–Lodomeria into a province in 1772, Habsburg officials realized that the local East Slavic people were distinct from both Poles and Russians and still called themselves &quot;Rus.&quot; This was true until the empire fell in 1918.

In the 1880s through the first decade of the 20th century, the popularity of the ethnonym &quot;Ukrainian&quot; spread, and the term &quot;Ukraine&quot; became a substitute for &quot;Malaya Rus&quot;&#x27; among the Ukrainian population of the empire. In the course of time, the term &quot;Rus&quot; became restricted to western parts of present-day Ukraine (Galicia/Halych, Carpathian Ruthenia), an area where Ukrainian nationalism competed with Galician Russophilia. By the early 20th century, the term &quot;Ukraine&quot; had mostly replaced &quot;Malorussia&quot; in those lands, and by the mid-1920s in the Ukrainian diaspora in North America as well.

&quot;Rusyn&quot; (the Ruthenian) has been an official self-identification of the Rus&#x27; population in Poland (and also in Czechoslovakia). Until 1939, for many Ruthenians and Poles, the word &quot;Ukrainiec&quot; (Ukrainian) meant a person involved in or friendly to a nationalist movement.

=== Modern Ruthenia ===

After 1918, the name &quot;Ruthenia&quot; became narrowed to the area south of the Carpathian Mountains in the Kingdom of Hungary, also called Carpathian Ruthenia (, including the cities of Mukachevo, Uzhhorod, and Prešov) and populated by Carpatho-Ruthenians, a group of East Slavic highlanders. While Galician Ruthenians considered themselves Ukrainians, the Carpatho-Ruthenians were the last East Slavic people who kept the historical name (&quot;Ruthen&quot; is a Latin form of the Slavic &quot;rusyn&quot;). Today, the term &quot;Rusyn&quot; is used to describe the ethnicity and language of Ruthenians, who are not compelled to adopt the Ukrainian national identity.

Carpathian Ruthenia (, ) became part of the newly founded Hungarian Kingdom in 1000. In May 1919, it was incorporated with nominal autonomy into the provisional Czechoslovak state as &quot;Subcarpathian Rus&quot;&#x27;. Since then, Ruthenian people have been divided into three orientations: Russophiles, who saw Ruthenians as part of the Russian nation; Ukrainophiles, who like their Galician counterparts across the Carpathian Mountains considered Ruthenians part of the Ukrainian nation; and Ruthenophiles, who claimed that Carpatho-Ruthenians were a separate nation and who wanted to develop a native Rusyn language and culture.

In 1938, under the Nazi regime in Germany, there were calls in the German press for the independence of a greater Ukraine, which would include Ruthenia, parts of Hungary, the Polish Southeast including Lviv, the Crimea, and Ukraine, including Kyiv and Kharkiv. (These calls were described in the French and Spanish press as &quot;troublemaking&quot;.)

On 15 March 1939, the Ukrainophile president of Carpatho-Ruthenia, Avhustyn Voloshyn, declared its independence as Carpatho-Ukraine. On the same day, regular troops of the Royal Hungarian Army occupied and annexed the region. In 1944 the Soviet Army occupied the territory, and in 1945 it was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR. Rusyns were not an officially recognized ethnic group in the USSR, as the Soviet government considered them to be Ukrainian.

A Rusyn minority remained, after World War II, in eastern Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia). According to critics, the Ruthenians rapidly became Slovakized. In 1995 the Ruthenian written language became standardized.

Following Ukrainian independence and dissolution of the Soviet Union (1990–91), the official position of the government and some Ukrainian politicians has been that the Rusyns are an integral part of the Ukrainian nation. Some of the population of Zakarpattia Oblast of Ukraine have identified as Rusyn (or Boyko, Hutsul, Lemko etc.) first and foremost; a subset of this second group has, nevertheless, considered Rusyns to be part of a broader Ukrainian national identity.

==Ruthenium==
In 1844, Karl Ernst Claus, Russian naturalist and chemist of Baltic German origin, isolated the element ruthenium from platinum ore found in the Ural Mountains. Claus named the element after &quot;Ruthenia&quot; to honor Russia.

<doc id="81193" wikidata="Q174666" url="?curid=81193" title="Cross-platform software">
<text>Within computing, cross-platform software (also called multi-platform software, platform-agnostic software, or platform-independent software) is computer software that is designed to work in several computing platforms. Some cross-platform software requires a separate build for each platform, but some can be directly run on any platform without special preparation, being written in an interpreted language or compiled to portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run-time packages are common or standard components of all supported platforms.

For example, a cross-platform application may run on Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows. Cross-platform software may run on many platforms, or as few as two. Some frameworks for cross-platform development are Codename One, ArkUI-X, Kivy, Qt, GTK, Flutter, NativeScript, Xamarin, Apache Cordova, Ionic, and React Native.

==Platforms==

&quot;Platform&quot; can refer to the type of processor (CPU) or other hardware on which an operating system (OS) or application runs, the type of OS, or a combination of the two. An example of a common platform is Android which runs on the ARM architecture family. Other well-known platforms are Linux/Unix, macOS and Windows, these are all cross-platform. Applications can be written to depend on the features of a particular platform—either the hardware, OS, or virtual machine (VM) it runs on. For example, the Java platform is a common VM platform which runs on many OSs and hardware types. 

===Hardware ===
A hardware platform can refer to an instruction set architecture. For example: ARM or the x86 architecture. These machines can run different operating systems.

Smartphones and tablets generally run ARM architecture, these often run Android or iOS and other mobile operating systems.

===Software ===
A software platform can be either an operating system (OS) or programming environment, though more commonly it is a combination of both. An exception is Java, which uses an OS-independent virtual machine (VM) to execute Java bytecode. Some software platforms are:

* Android (ARM64)
* ChromeOS (ARM32, ARM64, IA-32, x86-64)
* Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) by Microsoft, implemented in:
** The legacy .NET Framework that works only on Microsoft Windows.
** The newer .NET framework (simply called &quot;.NET&quot;) that works across Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.
** Other implementations such as Mono (formerly by Novell and Xamarin)
* HarmonyOS (ARM64, RISC-V, x86, x64, and LoongArch)
* iOS ((ARMv8-A))
* iPadOS (ARMv8-A)
* Java
* Linux ( Alpha, ARC, ARM, C-Sky, Hexagon, LoongArch, m68k, Microblaze, MIPS, Nios II, OpenRISC, PA-RISC, PowerPC, RISC-V, s390, SuperH, SPARC, x86, Xtensa)
* macOS x86, ARM (Apple silicon)
* Microsoft Windows (IA-32, x86-64, ARM, ARM64)
* PlayStation 4 (x86), PlayStation 3 (PowerPC) and PlayStation Vita (ARM)
* Solaris (SPARC, x86)
* SPARC
* Unix (many platforms since 1969)
* Web browsers – mostly compatible with each other, running JavaScript web-apps
* Xbox

;Minor, historical
* AmigaOS (m68k), AmigaOS 4 (PowerPC), AROS (x86, PowerPC, m68k), MorphOS (PowerPC)
* Atari TOS, MiNT
* BSD (many platforms; see NetBSDnet, for example)
* DOS-type systems on the x86: MS-DOS, PC DOS, DR-DOS, FreeDOS
* OS/2, eComStation
* BeOS (PowerPC, x86)

==== Java ====

The Java language is typically compiled to run on a VM that is part of the Java platform. The Java virtual machine (Java VM, JVM) is a CPU implemented in software, which runs all Java code. This enables the same code to run on all systems that implement a JVM. Java software can be executed by a hardware-based Java processor. This is used mostly in embedded systems.

Java code running in the JVM has access to OS-related services, like disk input/output (I/O) and network access, if the appropriate privileges are granted. The JVM makes the system calls on behalf of the Java application. This lets users to decide the appropriate protection level, depending on an access-control list (ACL). For example, disk and network access is usually enabled for desktop applications, but not for browser-based applets. The Java Native Interface (JNI) can also be used to access OS-specific functions, with a loss of portability.

Currently, Java Standard Edition software can run on Microsoft Windows, macOS, several Unix-like OSs, and several real-time operating systems for embedded devices. For mobile applications, browser plugins are used for Windows and Mac based devices, and Android has built-in support for Java. There are also subsets of Java, such as Java Card or Java Platform, Micro Edition, designed for resource-constrained devices.

== Implementation ==
For software to be considered cross-platform, it must function on more than one computer architecture or OS. Developing such software can be a time-consuming task because different OSs have different application programming interfaces (API).

Software written for one OS may not automatically work on all architectures that OS supports. Just because software is written in a popular programming language such as C or C++, it does not mean it will run on all OSs that support that language—or even on different versions of the same OS.

===Web applications===
Web applications are typically described as cross-platform because, ideally, they are accessible from any web browser: the browser is the platform. Web applications generally employ a client–server model, but vary widely in complexity and functionality. It can be hard to reconcile the desire for features with the need for compatibility.

Basic web applications perform all or most processing from a stateless server, and pass the result to the client web browser. All user interaction with the application consists of simple exchanges of data requests and server responses. This type of application was the norm in the early phases of World Wide Web application development. Such applications follow a simple transaction model, identical to that of serving static web pages. Today, they are still relatively common, especially where cross-platform compatibility and simplicity are deemed more critical than advanced functionality.

Prominent examples of advanced web applications include the Web interface to Gmail and Google Maps. Such applications routinely depend on additional features found only in the more recent versions of popular web browsers. These features include Ajax, JavaScript, Dynamic HTML, SVG, and other components of rich web applications.

==== Design ====
Because of the competing interests of compatibility and functionality, numerous design strategies have emerged.

Many software systems use a layered architecture where platform-dependent code is restricted to the upper- and lowermost layers.

=====Graceful degradation=====
Graceful degradation attempts to provide the same or similar functionality to all users and platforms, while diminishing that functionality to a least common denominator for more limited client browsers. For example, a user attempting to use a limited-feature browser to access Gmail may notice that Gmail switches to basic mode, with reduced functionality but still of use.

=====Multiple codebases=====
Some software is maintained in distinct codebases for different (hardware and OS) platforms, with equivalent functionality. This requires more effort to maintain the code, but can be worthwhile where the amount of platform-specific code is high.

=====Single codebase=====
This strategy relies on having one codebase that may be compiled to multiple platform-specific formats. One technique is conditional compilation. With this technique, code that is common to all platforms is not repeated. Blocks of code that are only relevant to certain platforms are made conditional, so that they are only interpreted or compiled when needed. Another technique is separation of functionality, which disables functionality not supported by browsers or OSs, while still delivering a complete application to the user. (See also: Separation of concerns.) This technique is used in web development where interpreted code (as in scripting languages) can query the platform it is running on to execute different blocks conditionally.

=====Third-party libraries=====
Third-party libraries attempt to simplify cross-platform capability by hiding the complexities of client differentiation behind a single, unified API, at the expense of vendor lock-in.

=====Responsive web design=====
Responsive web design (RWD) is a Web design approach aimed at crafting the visual layout of sites to provide an optimal viewing experience—easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling—across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors. Little or no platform-specific code is used with this technique.

==== Testing ====
Cross-platform applications need much more integration testing. Some web browsers prohibit installation of different versions on the same machine. There are several approaches used to target multiple platforms, but all of them result in software that requires substantial manual effort for testing and maintenance. Techniques such as full virtualization are sometimes used as a workaround for this problem.

Tools such as the Page Object Model allow cross-platform tests to be scripted so that one test case covers multiple versions of an app. If different versions have similar user interfaces, all can be tested with one test case.

===Traditional applications===
Web applications are becoming increasingly popular but many computer users still use traditional application software which does not rely on a client/web-server architecture. The distinction between traditional and web applications is not always clear. Features, installation methods and architectures for web and traditional applications overlap and blur the distinction. Nevertheless, this simplifying distinction is a common and useful generalization.

====Binary software====
Traditional application software has been distributed as binary files, especially executable files. Executables only support the platform they were built for—which means that a single cross-platform executable could be very bloated with code that never executes on a particular platform. Instead, generally there is a selection of executables, each built for one platform.

For software that is distributed as a binary executable, such as that written in C or C++, there must be a software build for each platform, using a toolset that translates—transcompiles—a single codebase into multiple binary executables. For example, Firefox, an open-source web browser, is available on Windows, macOS (both PowerPC and x86 through what Apple Inc. calls a Universal binary), Linux, and BSD on multiple computer architectures. The four platforms (in this case, Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD) are separate executable distributions, although they come largely from the same source code. In rare cases, executable code built for several platforms is combined into a single executable file called a fat binary.

The use of different toolsets may not be enough to build a working executables for different platforms. In this case, programmers must &quot;port&quot; the source code to the new platform. For example, an application such as Firefox, which already runs on Windows on the x86 family, can be modified and re-built to run on Linux on the x86 (and potentially other architectures) as well. The multiple versions of the code may be stored as separate codebases, or merged into one codebase.

An alternative to porting is &quot;cross-platform virtualization&quot;, where applications compiled for one platform can run on another without modification of the source code or binaries. As an example, Apple&#x27;s Rosetta, which is built into Intel-based Macintosh computers, runs applications compiled for the previous generation of Macs that used PowerPC CPUs. Another example is IBM PowerVM Lx86, which allows Linux/x86 applications to run unmodified on the Linux/Power OS.

Example of cross-platform binary software:

* The LibreOffice office suite is built for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Android, iOS, iPadOS, ChromeOS, web-based Collabora Online and many others. Many of these are supported on several hardware platforms with processor architectures including IA-32, x86-64, ARM (ARMel, ARMhf, ARM64), MIPS, MIPSel, PowerPC, ppc64le, and S390x[9]

====Scripts and interpreted languages====
A script can be considered to be cross-platform if its interpreter is available on multiple platforms and the script only uses the facilities built into the language. For example, a script written in Python for a Unix-like system will likely run with little or no modification on Windows, because Python also runs on Windows; indeed there are many implementations (e.g. IronPython for .NET Framework). The same goes for many of the open-source scripting languages.

Unlike binary executable files, the same script can be used on all computers that have software to interpret the script. This is because the script is generally stored in plain text in a text file. There may be some trivial issues, such as the representation of a new line character.

Some popular cross-platform scripting languages are:

* bash – A Unix shell commonly run on Linux and other modern Unix-like systems, as well as on Windows via the Cygwin POSIX compatibility layer, Git for Windows, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
* Perl – First released in 1987. Used for CGI programming, small system administration tasks, and more.
* PHP – Mostly used for web applications.
* Python – A language which focuses on rapid application development and ease of writing, instead of run-time efficiency.
* Ruby – An object-oriented language which aims to be easy to read. Can also be used on the web through Ruby on Rails.
* Tcl – A dynamic programming language, suitable for a wide range of uses, including web and desktop applications, networking, administration, testing and many more.

===Video games===
Cross-platform or multi-platform is a term that can also apply to video games released on a range of video game consoles. Examples of cross-platform games include: &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;, &quot;Tomb Raider: Legend&quot;, &quot;FIFA series&quot;, &quot;NHL series&quot; and &quot;Minecraft&quot;.

Each has been released across a variety of gaming platforms, such as the Wii, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, personal computers, and mobile devices.

Some platforms are harder to write for than others, requiring more time to develop the video game to the same standard. To offset this, a video game may be released on a few platforms first, then later on others. Typically, this happens when a new gaming system is released, because video game developers need to acquaint themselves with its hardware and software.

Some games may not be cross-platform because of licensing agreements between developers and video game console manufacturers that limit development to one particular console. As an example, Disney could create a game with the intention of release on the latest Nintendo and Sony game consoles. Should Disney license the game with Sony first, it may be required to release the game solely on Sony&#x27;s console for a short time or indefinitely.

====Cross-platform play====

Several developers have implemented ways to play games online while using different platforms. Psyonix, Epic Games, Microsoft, and Valve all possess technology that allows Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 gamers to play with PC gamers, leaving the decision of which platform to use to consumers. The first game to allow this level of interactivity between PC and console games (Dreamcast with specially produced keyboard and mouse) was &quot;Quake 3&quot;.

Games that feature cross-platform online play include &quot;Rocket League&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;, &quot;Paragon&quot; and &quot;Fable Fortune,&quot; and &quot;Minecraft&quot; with its Better Together update on Windows 10, VR editions, Pocket Edition and Xbox One.

==Programming ==
Cross-platform programming is the practice of deliberately writing software to work on more than one platform.

===Approaches ===
There are different ways to write a cross-platform application. One approach is to create multiple versions of the same software in different &quot;source trees&quot;—in other words, the Microsoft Windows version of an application might have one set of source code files and the Macintosh version another, while a FOSS *nix system might have a third. While this is straightforward, compared to developing for only one platform it can cost much more to pay a larger team or release products more slowly. It can also result in more bugs to be tracked and fixed.

Another approach is to use software that hides the differences between the platforms. This abstraction layer insulates the application from the platform. Such applications are &quot;platform agnostic&quot;. Applications that run on the JVM are built this way.

Some applications mix various methods of cross-platform programming to create the final application. An example is the Firefox web browser, which uses abstraction to build some of the lower-level components, with separate source subtrees for implementing platform-specific features (like the GUI), and the implementation of more than one scripting language to ease software portability. Firefox implements XUL, CSS and JavaScript for extending the browser, in addition to classic Netscape-style browser plugins. Much of the browser itself is written in XUL, CSS, and JavaScript.

==Challenges ==
There are many challenges when developing cross-platform software.

* Testing cross-platform applications may be considerably more complicated, since different platforms can exhibit slightly different behaviors or subtle bugs. This problem has led some developers to deride cross-platform development as &quot;write once, debug everywhere&quot;, a take on Sun Microsystems&#x27; &quot;write once, run anywhere&quot; marketing slogan.
* Developers are often restricted to using the lowest common denominator subset of features which are available on all platforms. This may hinder the application&#x27;s performance or prohibit developers from using the most advanced features of each platform.
* Different platforms often have different user interface conventions, which cross-platform applications do not always accommodate. For example, applications developed for macOS and GNOME are supposed to place the most important button on the right-hand side of a window or dialog, whereas Microsoft Windows and KDE have the opposite convention. Though many of these differences are subtle, a cross-platform application which does not conform to these conventions may feel clunky or alien to the user. When working quickly, such opposing conventions may even result in data loss, such as in a dialog box confirming whether to save or discard changes.
* Scripting languages and VM bytecode must be translated into native executable code each time they are used, imposing a performance penalty. This penalty can be alleviated using techniques like just-in-time compilation; but some computational overhead may be unavoidable.
* Different platforms require the use of native package formats such as RPM and MSI. Multi-platform installers such as InstallAnywhere address this need.
* Cross-platform execution environments may suffer cross-platform security flaws, creating a fertile environment for cross-platform malware.

<text>A computing platform, digital platform, or software platform is the infrastructure on which software is executed. While the individual components of a computing platform may be obfuscated under layers of abstraction, the &quot;summation of the required components comprise the computing platform&quot;. 

Sometimes, the most relevant layer for a specific software is called a computing platform in itself to facilitate the communication, referring to the whole using only one of its attributes – i.e. using a metonymy. 

For example, in a single computer system, this would be the computer&#x27;s architecture, operating system (OS), and runtime libraries. In the case of an application program or a computer video game, the most relevant layer is the operating system, so it can be called a platform itself (hence the term cross-platform for software that can be executed on multiple OSes, in this context). 
In a multi-computer system, such as in the case of offloading processing, it would encompass both the host computer&#x27;s hardware, operating system (OS), and runtime libraries along with other computers utilized for processing that are accessed via application programming interfaces or a web browser. As long as it is a required component for the program code to execute, it is part of the computing platform.

==Components==
Platforms may also include:

* Hardware alone, in the case of small embedded systems. Embedded systems can access hardware directly, without an OS; this is referred to as running on &quot;bare metal&quot;.
* Device drivers and firmware.
* A browser in the case of web-based software. The browser itself runs on a hardware+OS platform, but this is not relevant to software running within the browser.
* An application, such as a spreadsheet or word processor, which hosts software written in an application-specific scripting language, such as an Excel macro. This can be extended to writing fully-fledged applications with the Microsoft Office suite as a platform.
* Software frameworks that provide ready-made functionality.
* Cloud computing and Platform as a Service. Extending the idea of a software framework, these allow application developers to build software out of components that are hosted not by the developer, but by the provider, with internet communication linking them together. The social networking sites Twitter and Facebook are also considered development platforms.
* A application virtual machine (VM) such as the Java virtual machine or .NET CLR. Applications are compiled into a format similar to machine code, known as bytecode, which is then executed by the VM.
* A virtualized version of a complete system, including virtualized hardware, OS, software, and storage. These allow, for instance, a typical Windows program to run on what is physically a Mac.

Some architectures have multiple layers, with each layer acting as a platform for the one above it. In general, a component only has to be adapted to the layer immediately beneath it. For instance, a Java program has to be written to use the Java virtual machine (JVM) and associated libraries as a platform but does not have to be adapted to run on the Windows, Linux or Macintosh OS platforms. However, the JVM, the layer beneath the application, does have to be built separately for each OS.

<text>Aran (; ; ) (often known as the Aran Valley, or Val d&#x27;Aran in Aranese Occitan; in other forms of Occitan: &quot;Vath d&#x27;Aran&quot; or &quot;Vau d&#x27;Aran&quot;, in Catalan: &quot;Vall d&#x27;Aran&quot;, in Spanish: &quot;Valle de Arán&quot;) is an autonomous administrative entity (formerly considered a comarca) in northwest Catalonia, Spain, consisting of in area, located in the Pyrenees mountains, in the Alt Pirineu i Aran region and in the province of Lleida. The capital is Vielha e Mijaran.

This valley constitutes the only contiguous part of Catalonia located on the northern side of the Pyrenees. Hence, this valley holds the only Catalan rivers to flow into the Atlantic Ocean (for the same reason, the region is characterized by an Atlantic climate, instead of a Mediterranean one). The Garonne river flows through Aran from its source on the Pla de Beret (Beret Flat) near the Port de la Bonaigua. It is joined by the Joèu river (from the slopes of Aneto mountain) which passes underground at the &quot;Forau d&#x27;Aigualluts&quot;. It then reappears in the Val dera Artiga de Lin before reaching the Aran valley, then through France and eventually to the Atlantic Ocean. The Noguera Pallaresa river, whose source is only a hundred meters from that of the Garonne, flows the opposite way towards the Mediterranean.

Aran borders France on the north, the Autonomous Community of Aragon to the west and the Catalan comarques of Alta Ribagorça to the south and Pallars Sobirà to the east. Its capital, Vielha e Mijaran, has 5,474 inhabitants (2014). The entire population of the valley is about 9,991 (2014). As of 2001, a plurality of people in Aran spoke Spanish (38.78%) as their native language, followed by Aranese (34.19%), then Catalan (19.45%) with 7.56% having a different native language. While Aranese is the mother tongue of 62.87% of people born in the region, it is less frequent among residents born outside the valley.

==History==

In 1313, James II of Aragon granted administrative and political autonomy to the Aran Valley, the legal details of which are described in a Latin manuscript called the Querimonia. The devolution of power was a reward for the Aranese pledging allegiance to James II in a dispute with the kingdoms of France and Mallorca over control of the valley. This status was suppressed in 1834, when the Valley was integrated into the new Province of Lleida, in the context of the establishment of the Spanish provinces at the beginning of the liberal state.

On 19 October 1944, Spanish Communist Party guerrillas invaded the valley in an attempt to bring about the fall of the Spanish dictatorship. They took control of several villages until October 27, 1944, but were forced to retreat back into France after Franco sent reinforcements to defend Vielha.

Before the construction of the Vielha tunnel, opened in 1948, the Aran valley had no direct communication with the south side of the mountains during winter.

In 1987 it became an administrative comarca. In 1990 the special status of Aran within Catalonia was restored by the Parliament of Catalonia, reestablishing the Conselh Generau, granting it a degree of home rule and declaring Occitan as official language. In 2015 the Catalan Parliament passed a new law which increased the powers of the Conselh Generau and recognized Aran as an &quot;Occitan national reality&quot;.

The population of Val d&#x27;Aran has generally been opposed to the Catalan independence movement due to lack of a strong Catalan identity.

==Name and local language==

Aranese is the standardized form of the local Gascon variety of the Occitan language. Aranese has been regularly taught at school since 1984. Like several other minority languages in Europe that recently faced decline, Aranese is experiencing a renaissance.

The name Aran comes from Basque &quot;haran&quot;, meaning valley. Maps and road signs in Spain use the name &quot;era Val d&#x27;Aran&quot; to refer to the valley, where &quot;era&quot; is the Aranese singular feminine article. The same practice goes for all towns and other locations in Aran, for example, the Aranese spelling &quot;Vielha&quot; is used instead of Catalan and Spanish &quot;Viella&quot; to refer to the capital of Aran.

Basque toponyms reveal that Basque was spoken further east along the Pyrenees than today. The growing influence of Latin began to drive Basque out after the turn of the first millennium.

==Government and economy==
Administratively, Aran is a &quot;unique territorial entity&quot; roughly equivalent to a &quot;comarca&quot; with additional powers, and informally referred to as a comarca. This status was most recently formalised in February 2015. The area is divided into six administrative divisions called &quot;terçons&quot; (meaning &quot;thirds&quot;, as there were formerly three divisions). The current arrangement of the divisions dates from the 15th century. Since 1991, Aran has an autonomous government called the &quot;Conselh Generau d&#x27;Aran&quot; (), headed by the Síndic d&#x27;Aran.

The major political parties are the Unity of Aran - Aranese Nationalist Party (the local chapter of the Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia), the Aranese Democratic Convergence (the local chapter of the (Democratic Convergence of Catalonia). The Occitan Republican Left party was founded in 2008.

The main economic activity in the valley is tourism; from the ski resorts in the winter and from other tourist activity in the summer. Other primary sectors of the economy include forest products, cattle ranching and agriculture, all of which have become progressively less important since the opening of ski resorts.

===Municipalities===

==Fauna==
Many native animals of Aran are in danger of extinction. There are programs to reintroduce and/or protect: 
* Aran rock lizard (&quot;Lacerta aranica&quot;)
* Bearded vulture (&quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;)
* Brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;)
* Rock ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus mutus&quot;)

<doc id="81211" wikidata="Q1196572" url="?curid=81211" title="Fading">
<text>In wireless communications, fading is the variation of signal attenuation over variables like time, geographical position, and radio frequency. Fading is often modeled as a random process. In wireless systems, fading may either be due to multipath propagation, referred to as multipath-induced fading, weather (particularly rain), or shadowing from obstacles affecting the wave propagation, sometimes referred to as shadow fading.

A fading channel is a communication channel that experiences fading.

==Key concepts==

The presence of reflectors in the environment surrounding a transmitter and receiver create multiple paths that a transmitted signal can traverse. As a result, the receiver sees the superposition of multiple copies of the transmitted signal, each traversing a different path. Each signal copy will experience differences in attenuation, delay and phase shift while traveling from the source to the receiver. This can result in either constructive or destructive interference, which amplifies or attenuates the signal power seen at the receiver. Strong destructive interference is frequently referred to as a deep fade and may result in temporary failure of communication due to a severe drop in the channel signal-to-noise ratio.

A common example of deep fade is the experience of stopping at a traffic light and hearing an FM broadcast degenerate into static, while the signal is re-acquired if the vehicle moves only a fraction of a meter. The loss of the broadcast is caused by the vehicle stopping at a point where the signal experienced severe destructive interference. Cellular phones can also exhibit similar momentary fades.

Fading channel models are often used to model the effects of electromagnetic transmission of information over the air in cellular networks and broadcast communication. Fading channel models are also used in underwater acoustic communications to model the distortion caused by the water.

==Types==

===Slow versus fast fading===

The terms &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; fading refer to the rate at which the magnitude and phase change imposed by the channel on the signal changes. The coherence time is a measure of the minimum time required for the magnitude change or phase change of the channel to become uncorrelated from its previous value.

* Slow fading arises when the coherence time of the channel is large relative to the delay requirement of the application. In this regime, the amplitude and phase change imposed by the channel can be considered roughly constant over the period of use. Slow fading can be caused by events such as shadowing, where a large obstruction such as a hill or large building obscures the main signal path between the transmitter and the receiver. The received power change caused by shadowing is often modeled using a log-normal distribution with a standard deviation according to the log-distance path loss model.
* Fast fading occurs when the coherence time of the channel is small relative to the delay requirement of the application. In this case, the amplitude and phase change imposed by the channel varies considerably over the period of use.

In a fast-fading channel, the transmitter may take advantage of the variations in the channel conditions using time diversity to help increase robustness of the communication to a temporary deep fade. Although a deep fade may temporarily erase some of the information transmitted, use of an error-correcting code coupled with successfully transmitted bits during other time instances (interleaving) can allow for the erased bits to be recovered. In a slow-fading channel, it is not possible to use time diversity because the transmitter sees only a single realization of the channel within its delay constraint. A deep fade therefore lasts the entire duration of transmission and cannot be mitigated using coding.

The coherence time of the channel is related to a quantity known as the Doppler spread of the channel. When a user (or reflectors in its environment) is moving, the user&#x27;s velocity causes a shift in the frequency of the signal transmitted along each signal path. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler shift. Signals traveling along different paths can have different Doppler shifts, corresponding to different rates of change in phase. The difference in Doppler shifts between different signal components contributing to a signal fading channel tap is known as the Doppler spread. Channels with a large Doppler spread have signal components that are each changing independently in phase over time. Since fading depends on whether signal components add constructively or destructively, such channels have a very short coherence time.

In general, coherence time is inversely related to Doppler spread, typically expressed as

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the coherence time, formula_3 is the Doppler spread. This equation is just an approximation, to be exact, see Coherence time.

===Block fading===
Block fading is where the fading process is approximately constant for a number of symbol intervals. A channel can be &#x27;doubly block-fading&#x27; when it is block fading in both the time and frequency domains. Many wireless communications channels are dynamic by nature, and are commonly modeled as block fading. In these channels each block of symbol goes through a statistically independent transformation. Typically the slowly-varying channels based on jakes model of Rayleigh spectrum is used for block fading in an OFDM system.

===Selective fading===
Selective fading or frequency selective fading is a radio propagation anomaly caused by partial cancellation of a radio signal by itself — the signal arrives at the receiver by two different paths, and at least one of the paths is changing (lengthening or shortening). This typically happens in the early evening or early morning as the various layers in the ionosphere move, separate, and combine. The two paths can both be skywave or one be groundwave.

Selective fading manifests as a slow, cyclic disturbance; the cancellation effect, or &quot;null&quot;, is deepest at one particular frequency, which changes constantly, sweeping through the received audio.

As the carrier frequency of a signal is varied, the magnitude of the change in amplitude will vary. The coherence bandwidth measures the separation in frequency after which two signals will experience uncorrelated fading.
* In flat fading, the coherence bandwidth of the channel is larger than the bandwidth of the signal. Therefore, all frequency components of the signal will experience the same magnitude of fading.
* In frequency-selective fading, the coherence bandwidth of the channel is smaller than the bandwidth of the signal. Different frequency components of the signal therefore experience uncorrelated fading.

Since different frequency components of the signal are affected independently, it is highly unlikely that all parts of the signal will be simultaneously affected by a deep fade. Certain modulation schemes such as orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and code-division multiple access (CDMA) are well-suited to employing frequency diversity to provide robustness to fading. OFDM divides the wideband signal into many slowly modulated narrowband subcarriers, each exposed to flat fading rather than frequency selective fading. This can be combated by means of error coding, simple equalization or adaptive bit loading. Inter-symbol interference is avoided by introducing a guard interval between the symbols called a cyclic prefix. CDMA uses the rake receiver to deal with each echo separately.

Frequency-selective fading channels are also &quot;dispersive&quot;, in that the signal energy associated with each symbol is spread out in time. This causes transmitted symbols that are adjacent in time to interfere with each other. Equalizers are often deployed in such channels to compensate for the effects of the intersymbol interference.

The echoes may also be exposed to Doppler shift, resulting in a time varying channel model.

The effect can be counteracted by applying some diversity scheme, for example OFDM (with subcarrier interleaving and forward error correction), or by using two receivers with separate antennas spaced a quarter-wavelength apart, or a specially designed diversity receiver with two antennas. Such a receiver continuously compares the signals arriving at the two antennas and presents the better signal.

=== Upfade ===
Upfade is a special case of fading, used to describe constructive interference, in situations where a radio signal gains strength. Some multipath conditions cause a signal&#x27;s amplitude to be increased in this way because signals travelling by different paths arrive at the receiver in phase and become additive to the main signal. Hence, the total signal that reaches the receiver will be stronger than the signal would otherwise have been without the multipath conditions. 
The effect is also noticeable in wireless LAN systems.

==Models==
Examples of fading models for the distribution of the attenuation are:
* &quot;Dispersive fading&quot; models, with several echoes, each exposed to different delay, gain and phase shift, often constant. This results in frequency selective fading and inter-symbol interference. The gains may be Rayleigh or Rician distributed. The echoes may also be exposed to Doppler shift, resulting in a time varying channel model.
* Nakagami fading
* Log-normal shadow fading
* Rayleigh fading
* Rician fading
* Two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading
* Weibull fading

==Mitigation==

Fading can cause poor performance in a communication system because it can result in a loss of signal power without reducing the power of the noise. This signal loss can be over some or all of the signal bandwidth. Fading can also be a problem as it changes over time: communication systems are often designed to adapt to such impairments, but the fading can change faster than the adaptations can be made. In such cases, the probability of experiencing a fade (and associated bit errors as the signal-to-noise ratio drops) on the channel becomes the limiting factor in the link&#x27;s performance.

The effects of fading can be combated by using diversity to transmit the signal over multiple channels that experience independent fading and coherently combining them at the receiver. The probability of experiencing a fade in this composite channel is then proportional to the probability that all the component channels simultaneously experience a fade, a much more unlikely event.

Diversity can be achieved in time, frequency, or space. Common techniques used to overcome signal fading include:

* Diversity reception and transmission
* MIMO
* OFDM
* Rake receivers
* Space–time codes
* Forward error correction
* Interleaving

Besides diversity, techniques such as application of cyclic prefix (e.g. in OFDM) and channel estimation and equalization can also be used to tackle fading.

<text>Aerobiology (from Greek , &quot;aēr&quot;, &quot;air&quot;; , &quot;bios&quot;, &quot;life&quot;; and , &quot;&quot;) is a branch of biology that studies the passive transport of organic particles, such as bacteria, fungal spores, very small insects, pollen grains and viruses. Aerobiologists have traditionally been involved in the measurement and reporting of airborne pollen and fungal spores as a service to those with allergies. However, aerobiology is a varied field, relating to environmental science, plant science, meteorology, phenology, and climate change.

== Overview ==

The first mention of &quot;aerobiology&quot; was made by Fred Campbell Meier in the 1930s. The particles, which can be described as Aeroplankton, generally range in size from nanometers to micrometers which makes them challenging to detect.

Aerosolization is the process of a small and light particles becoming suspended in moving air. Now bioaerosols, these pollen and fungal spores can be transported across an ocean, or even travel around the globe. Due to the high quantities of microbes and the ease of dispersion, Martinus Beijerinck once said &quot;Everything is everywhere, the environment selects&quot;. This means that aeroplankton are everywhere and have been everywhere, and it solely depends on environmental factors to determine which remain. Aeroplankton are found in significant quantities even in the Atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). The effects on climate and cloud chemistry of these atmospheric populations is still under review.

NASA and other research agencies are studying how long these bioaerosols can remain afloat and how they can survive in such extreme climates. The conditions of the upper atmosphere are similar to the climate on Mars&#x27; surface, and the microbes found are helping redefine the conditions which can support life.

== Dispersal of particles ==

The process of dispersal of aerobiological particles has 3 steps: removal from source, dispersion through air, and deposition to rest. The particle geometry and environment affect all three phases, however once it is aerosolized, its fate depends on the laws of physics governing the motion of the air.

=== Removal from Source ===

Pollen and spores can be blown from their surface or shaken loose. Generally the wind speed required for release is higher than average wind speed. Rain splatter can also dislodge spores. Some fungi can even be triggered by environmental factors to actively eject spores.

=== Dispersion through Air ===

Once released from rest, the aeroplankton is at the mercy of the wind and physics. The settling speed of spores and pollen vary and is a major factor in dispersion; the longer the particle is floating, the longer it can be caught by a turbulent wind gust. Wind speed and direction fluctuate with time and height, so the specific path of once neighboring particles can vary significantly. The concentration of particles in the air decreases with distance from source, and the dispersion distance is most accurately modeled as a power function.

=== Deposition to Rest ===

Deposition is a combination of gravity and inertia. The fall speed for small particles can be calculated by mass and geometry, but the complex shapes of pollen and spores often fall slower than their estimated speed modeled with simple shapes. Spores can also be removed from the air from impact; the inertia of the particles will cause them to hit surfaces along their path, instead of flowing around them like air.

== Experimental methods ==

There have been many studies performed to understand real-life dispersal patterns of pollen and spores. To collect samples, studies often use a volumetric spore trap such as a Hirst-type sampler. Particles stick to a sampling strip and then can be inspected under a microscope. Scientists have to count the particles under magnification, and then analyze sample DNA by Amplicon sequence variant (ASV) or another common method.

A challenge repeatedly cited in literature is that because of differing testing or analysis methodologies, results are not always comparable across studies. Therefore, extensive data collection must be performed in each study to get an accurate model. Unfortunately there is no database of aerobiological particle distribution to compare results to.

== Effects on human health ==

Allergic rhinitis is a type of inflammation in the nose that occurs when the immune system overreacts to allergens in the air. It is typically triggered in humans by pollen and other bioaerosols. Between 10% and 30% of people in Western countries are affected. Symptoms are usually worse during pollination periods, when there is significantly more pollen aerosolized in the air. In these peak periods, staying indoors is one way to limit exposure. However, studies have shown that there are still significant levels of pollen indoors. In the winter, pollen levels indoors actually exceed outdoor levels.

Up to date data on pollen levels is critical for humans that have allergies. A current limitation is that many spore traps require scientists to identify and count individual pollen grains under magnification. This causes data to be delayed, sometimes by over a week. There are currently a number of fully automatic spore traps in development, and once they are fully functional they will improve the lives of people with allergies.

== Effects of climate change ==

Scientists have predicted that the meteorological results of climate change will weaken pollen and spore dispersal barriers, and lead to less biological uniqueness in different regions. Precipitation increases richness (number of species) of biodiversity in regions because clouds formulate in the upper atmosphere where there is more varied biodiversity. Specifically in the Arctic, climate change has dramatically increased precipitation, and scientists have seen new microbes in the area because of it.

Rising summer temperatures and CO2 levels have shown to increase total amounts of pollen released by certain trees, as well as delay the start of pollen season. However, more studies are needed to see long term effects of climate change.

<text>Intelligent dance music (IDM) is a style of electronic music originating in the early 1990s, defined by idiosyncratic experimentation rather than specific genre constraints. The music often described with the term originally emerged in the early 1990s from the culture and sound palette of styles of electronic dance music such as acid house, ambient techno, Detroit techno and breakbeat; it has been regarded as better suited to home listening than dancing. Prominent artists in the style include Aphex Twin, Autechre, Squarepusher, μ-Ziq, the Black Dog and the later duo Plaid, as well as earlier acts such as the Future Sound of London and Orbital.

The use of the term &quot;intelligent dance music&quot; was likely inspired by the 1992 Warp compilation &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; in 1993 with the formation of the &quot;IDM list&quot;, an electronic mailing list which was chartered for the discussion of English artists appearing on the compilation. The term has been widely criticised and dismissed by artists associated with it. Rephlex Records, a label co-created by Aphex Twin, coined the term &quot;braindance&quot; as an alternative. In 2014, music critic Sasha Frere-Jones observed that the term IDM &quot;is widely reviled but still commonly used&quot;.

==History==
===Intelligent techno and electronica===

In the late 1980s, ensuing from acid house and early rave party scenes, UK-based groups such as the Orb and the KLF produced ambient house, a genre that fused the pulses of house music, particularly acid house, with ambient music and sample-based soundscapes. By the early 1990s, the increasingly distinct music associated with dance music-oriented experimentation had gained prominence with releases on a variety of mostly UK-based record labels, including Warp (1989), Black Dog Productions (1989), R&amp;S Records (1989), Carl Craig&#x27;s Planet E, Rising High Records (1991), Richard James&#x27;s Rephlex Records (1991), Kirk Degiorgio&#x27;s Applied Rhythmic Technology (1991), Eevo Lute Muzique (1991), General Production Recordings (1989), Soma Quality Recordings (1991), Peacefrog Records (1991), and Metamorphic Recordings (1992).

In 1992, Warp released &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, the first album in the &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; series. Subtitled &quot;electronic listening music from Warp&quot;, the record was a collection of tracks from artists such as Autechre, B12, Black Dog Productions, Aphex Twin and the Orb, under various aliases. This would help establish the ambient techno sound of the early 1990s. Steve Beckett, co-owner of Warp, has said the electronic music that the label was releasing then was targeting a post-club, home-listening audience. Following the success of the &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; series, &quot;intelligent techno&quot; became the favoured term, although &quot;ambient&quot;—without a qualifying &quot;house&quot; or &quot;techno&quot; suffix, but still referring to a hybrid form—was a common synonym.

In the same period (1992–93), other names were also used, such as &quot;art techno&quot;, &quot;armchair techno&quot;, and &quot;electronica&quot;, but all were attempts to describe an emerging offshoot of electronic dance music that was being enjoyed by the &quot;sedentary and stay at home&quot;. At the same time, the UK market was saturated with increasingly frenetic breakbeat and sample-laden hardcore techno records that quickly became formulaic. &quot;Rave&quot; had become a &quot;dirty word&quot;, so as an alternative, it was common for London nightclubs to advertise that they were playing &quot;intelligent&quot; or &quot;pure&quot; techno, appealing to a &quot;discerning&quot; crowd that considered the hardcore sound to be too commercial.

===Usage of the term IDM and popularization===
In November 1991, the phrase &quot;intelligent techno&quot; appeared on Usenet in reference to English experimental group Coil&#x27;s &quot;The Snow&quot; EP. Off the Internet, the same phrase appeared in both the U.S. and UK music press in late 1992, in reference to Jam &amp; Spoon&#x27;s &quot;Tales from a Danceographic Ocean&quot; and the music of the Future Sound of London. Another instance of the phrase appeared on Usenet in April 1993 in reference to the Black Dog&#x27;s album &quot;Bytes&quot;. And in July 1993, in his review of an ethno-dance compilation for &quot;NME&quot;, Ben Willmott replaced &quot;techno&quot; with &quot;dance music&quot;, writing &quot;...current &#x27;intelligent&#x27; dance music owes much more to Eastern mantra-like repetition and neo-ambient instrumentation than the disco era which preceded the advent of acid and techno.&quot;

Wider public use of such terms on the Internet came in August 1993, when Alan Parry announced the existence of a new electronic mailing list for discussion of &quot;intelligent&quot; dance music: the &quot;Intelligent Dance Music list&quot;, or &quot;IDM List&quot; for short. The first message, sent on 1 August 1993, was entitled &quot;Can Dumb People Enjoy IDM, Too?&quot;. A reply from the list server&#x27;s system administrator and founder of Hyperreal.org Brian Behlendorf, revealed that Parry originally wanted to create a list devoted to discussion of the music on the Rephlex label, but they decided together to expand its charter to include music similar to what was on Rephlex or that was in different genres but which had been made with similar approaches. They picked the word &quot;intelligent&quot; because it had already appeared on &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; and because it connoted being something beyond just music for dancing, while still being open to interpretation.

Warp&#x27;s second &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; compilation was released in 1994. The album featured fragments of posts from the IDM mailing list incorporated into typographic artwork by the Designers Republic. Sleeve notes by David Toop acknowledged the genre&#x27;s multitude of musical and cultural influences and suggested none should be considered more important than any other.

During this period, the electronic music produced by Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin (an alias of Richard D. James), Autechre, LFO, B12, Seefeel and the Black Dog, gained popularity among electronic music fans, as did music by artists on the Rephlex and Skam labels. Laurent Fintoni, writing for &quot;Fact&quot; magazine, emphasized Miami as a central importer and exporter of IDM in the United States, including the likes of Richard Devine (Schematic/Warp), Alpha 606, Prefuse-73 (Schematic/Warp), Push Button Objects, Otto von Schirach (Schematic) and many more.

Bigger-name, cross-genre artists like Björk and Radiohead, who had become inspired by artists categorized as IDM and utilized elements of the style on multiple songs on their 2000 album &quot;Kid A&quot;, also acquired popularity and associations with IDM in various ways.

===Late 1990s onward===
American audiences in underground music subcultures welcomed IDM, and by the late 1990s many IDM record labels had been founded in the United States, including Drop Beat, Isophlux, Suction, Schematic and Cytrax.

In 2007, Igloo Magazine observed that &quot;IDM as we knew it is a distant memory, with reminders from the big names now depressingly infrequent, however IDM as we now know it is very much alive, albeit in a less influential and popular, but still respectable form&quot;, with a third wave of artists having become active beginning in the mid-2000s.

==Criticism of the term==
British electronic music and techno artists typically categorized as IDM, including Aphex Twin, Cylob, and Mike Paradinas (A.K.A. μ-Ziq), have variously criticised the term. Paradinas has stated that the term was only used in North America; criticism has often been dominated by the use of the term &quot;intelligent&quot; in the genre name, and also often calls attention to the fact that artists working under this name often produce music that is contrarily not easy to dance to.

&quot;AllMusic Guide&quot; describes the IDM name asA loaded term meant to distinguish electronic music of the &#x27;90s and later that&#x27;s equally comfortable on the dancefloor as in the living room, IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) eventually acquired a good deal of negative publicity, not least among the legion of dance producers and fans whose exclusion from the community prompted the question of whether they produced &quot;Stupid&quot; dance music. In a September 1997 interview, Aphex Twin commented on the &#x27;Intelligent Dance Music&#x27; label:
I just think it&#x27;s really funny to have terms like that. It&#x27;s basically saying &#x27;this is intelligent and everything else is stupid.&#x27; It&#x27;s really nasty to everyone else&#x27;s music. (laughs) It makes me laugh, things like that. I don&#x27;t use names. I just say that I like something or I don&#x27;t.

Aphex Twin&#x27;s Rephlex records official overarching genre name is &quot;braindance&quot;, of which Dave Segal of Stylus Magazine asked whether it was a &quot;snide dig at IDM&#x27;s mockworthy Intelligent Dance Music tag?&quot;

In 2003, Kid 606 said thatIt&#x27;s a label invented by PR companies who need catchphrases. I like sounds, but hate what people attach to sounds.

Matmos remarked in &quot;Perfect Sound Forever&quot; that
I belong to the weblist called &quot;IDM&quot; and occasionally enjoy the discussions there, because I like some of the artists who get lassoed into that category (not to mention that we, occasionally, are lumped into that category too), and because you can occasionally find out about interesting records on that list... Matmos is IDM if that only means &quot;might be talked about on the IDM list&quot;- but I don&#x27;t endorse that term &quot;intelligent dance music&quot; because it&#x27;s laughable.

In a 2016 interview with &quot;Resident Advisor&quot;, Sean Booth of Autechre said: All these things about us being &quot;intelligent&quot; and the term &quot;IDM&quot; are just silly. I&#x27;m not a particularly intelligent person, me. I&#x27;m diligent, I&#x27;m pretty hardworking, but I&#x27;m not that clever. I ain&#x27;t got any qualifications, I just pick up stuff that I think is interesting at the time...There was also the &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; tag that Warp coined, but to me as a listener that never seemed to be saying &quot;this is more intelligent.&quot; It was just a signifier of it being sci-fi music...Thing is, almost all the artists on that first AI compilation are just like us, they were regular kids, they&#x27;re not intelligent people particularly. Richard [D. James] is a fucking blagger, Richie Hawtin too... I don&#x27;t know how the fuck he gets away with the things he does! 

Responding to some of these criticisms, Mike Brown of Hyperreal.org commented in 2018, Even in &#x27;93 to 4&#x27; the word &quot;IDM&quot; wasn&#x27;t something any of us took seriously. It was just three letters with no particular meaning beyond our little nerdy community&#x27;s way of referring to whatever music we liked from the fringes of electronic dance music. No one was intending to coin a genre name or to imply the artists and fans were geniuses.

<text>The Australian dollar (sign: $; code: AUD; also abbreviated A$ or sometimes AU$ to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies; and also referred to as the dollar or Aussie dollar) is the official currency and legal tender of Australia, including all of its external territories, and three independent sovereign Pacific Island states: Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. , it was the in the foreign exchange market and the sixth most-held reserve currency in global reserves.

The Australian dollar was introduced as a decimal currency on 14 February 1966 to replace the non-decimal Australian pound, with the conversion rate of two dollars to the pound (A£1 = A$2). It is subdivided into 100 cents. The $ symbol precedes the amount. On the introduction of the currency, the $ symbol was intended to have two strokes, but the version with one stroke has also always been acceptable.

, there were A$4.4 billion in coins and A$101.3 billion in notes of Australian currency in circulation, or around A$6,700 per person in Australia, which includes cash reserves held by the banking system and cash in circulation in other countries or held as a foreign exchange reserve.

== Constitutional basis ==
Section 51(xii) of the Constitution of Australia gives the Commonwealth (federal) Parliament the power to legislate with respect to &quot;currency, coinage, and legal tender&quot;. The states are not allowed to coin money, in accordance with section 115 which provides that &quot;[a] State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts&quot;. Australian coins are now produced at the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Before Federation in 1901, the six colonies that comprised Australia had separate currencies, all of which closely replicated the British currency system, and were usually exchangeable with each other on a one-to-one basis. Hence Federation was not seen as urgently requiring a single, unified currency. For another 10 years, colonial banknotes and coins continued to be the main circulating currencies.

In 1902, a select committee of the House of Representatives, chaired by George Edwards, had recommended that Australia adopt a single, national decimal currency, with a pound divided into ten florins and each florin comprising 100 cents. However, the recommendation was not acted upon.

The Australian pound (A£) was introduced in 1910, at par with the pound sterling (A£1 = UK£1). Like the UK pound, it was divided into 240 pence, or 20 shillings (each comprising 12 pence). In December 1931, the Australian currency was devalued by 25%, so that one pound five shillings Australian was equivalent to one pound sterling.

In 1937, a banking royal commission, appointed by the Lyons government, recommended that Australia adopt &quot;a system of decimal coinage ... based upon the division of the Australian pound into 1000 parts&quot;. This recommendation was not accepted either.

=== Adoption of the dollar ===
In February 1959, treasurer Harold Holt appointed a Decimal Currency Committee, chaired by Walter D. Scott, to examine the merits of decimalisation. The committee reported in August 1960 in favour of decimalisation and proposed that a new currency be introduced (from February 1963), to be modelled on South Africa&#x27;s replacement of the South African pound with the rand (worth 10 shillings or pound). The Menzies government announced its support for decimalisation in July 1961, but delayed the process in order to give further consideration to the implementation process. In April 1963, Holt announced that a decimal currency was scheduled to be introduced in February 1966, with a base unit equal to 10 shillings, and that a Decimal Currency Board would be established to oversee the transition process.

A public consultation process was held in which over 1,000 names were suggested for the new currency. This was reduced to a shortlist of seven names: austral, crown, dollar, pound, regal, tasman and royal. In June 1963, Holt announced that the new currency would be called the &quot;royal&quot;. This met with widespread public disapproval, and three months later it was announced that it would instead be named the &quot;dollar&quot;.

The pound was replaced by the dollar on 14 February 1966 with the conversion rate of A$2 = A£1. For example, a pre-decimal amount of nine pounds, sixteen shillings and sixpence (£9 16s 6d) became $19.65 in terms of dollars and cents. Since Australia was still part of the fixed-exchange sterling area, the exchange rate was fixed to the pound sterling at a rate of A$1 = 8s sterling (or £1 stg = A$2.50, and in turn £1 stg = US$2.80). In 1967, Australia effectively left the sterling area when the pound sterling was devalued against the US dollar from US$2.80 to US$2.40, but the Australian dollar chose to retain its peg to the US dollar at A$1 = US$1.12 (hence appreciating in value versus sterling).

The Australian dollar is legal tender in its external territories: Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island; and is also official currency in Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. It was legal tender in Papua New Guinea until 31 December 1975 when it was replaced by the kina, and in Solomon Islands until 1977 when it was replaced by the Solomon Islands dollar.

== Coins ==
In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of 1 and 2 cents (bronze); 5, 10, and 20 cents (cupronickel; 75% copper, 25% nickel); and 50 cents (silver, then cupronickel). The 50-cent coins in 80% silver were no longer minted after March 1968 due to the intrinsic value of the silver content rising to exceed the face value of the coins. Aluminium bronze (92% copper, 6% aluminium, 2% nickel) 1 dollar coins were introduced in 1984, followed by aluminium bronze 2 dollar coins in 1988, to replace the banknotes of that value. In everyday Australian parlance, these coins collectively are referred to as &quot;gold coins&quot;. 1 and 2 cent coins were discontinued in 1991 and withdrawn from circulation in 1992; since then cash transactions have been rounded to the nearest 5 cents.

Australia&#x27;s coins are produced by the Royal Australian Mint, which is located in the nation&#x27;s capital, Canberra. Since opening in 1965, the Mint has produced more than 14 billion circulating coins, and has the capacity to produce more than two million coins per day, or more than 600 million coins per year.

Current Australian 5, 10 and 20 cent coins are identical in size to the former Australian, New Zealand, and British sixpence, shilling, and two shilling (florin) coins. Pre-decimal Australian coins remain legal tender for 10 cents per shilling. Before 2006 the old New Zealand 5, 10 and 20 cent coins were often mistaken for Australian coins of the same value, and vice versa, and therefore circulated in both countries. The UK replaced these coins with smaller versions from 1990 to 1993, as did New Zealand in 2006. Still, some confusion occurs with the larger-denomination coins in the two countries; Australia&#x27;s $1 coin is similar in size to New Zealand&#x27;s $2 coin, and the New Zealand $1 coin is similar in size to Australia&#x27;s $2 coin.

With a mass of and a diameter of , the Australian 50-cent coin is one of the largest coins used in the world today.

=== Commemorative coins ===
The Royal Australian Mint also has an international reputation for producing quality numismatic coins. It has first issued commemorative 50-cent coins in 1970, commemorating James Cook&#x27;s exploration along the east coast of the Australian continent, followed in 1977 by a coin for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee, the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982, and the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. Issues expanded into greater numbers in the 1990s and the 21st century, responding to collector demand. Commemorative designs have also been featured on the circulating two dollar, one dollar, and 20 cent coins.

In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of decimal currency, the 2006 mint proof and uncirculated sets included one- and two-cent coins. In early 2013, Australia&#x27;s first triangular coin was introduced to mark the 25th anniversary of the opening of Parliament House. The silver $5 coin is 99.9% silver, and depicts Parliament House as viewed from one of its courtyards.

== Banknotes ==
=== First series ===
The first paper issues of the Australian dollar were issued in 1966. The $1, $2, $10 and $20 notes had exact equivalents in the former pound notes. The $5 note was issued in 1967, the $50 was issued in 1973 and the $100 was issued in 1984.

The $1 banknote was replaced by a $1 coin in 1984, while the $2 banknote was replaced by a smaller $2 coin in 1988. Although no longer printed, all previous notes of the Australian dollar remain legal tender.

Shortly after the changeover, substantial counterfeiting of $10 notes was detected. This provided an impetus for the Reserve Bank of Australia to develop new note technologies jointly with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, culminating in the introduction of the first polymer banknote in 1988.

=== First polymer series ===
Australia was the first country to produce polymer banknotes, more specifically made of polypropylene polymer, which were produced by Note Printing Australia. These polymer notes are cleaner than paper notes, are more durable and easily recyclable.

The first polymer banknote was issued in 1988 as a $10 note commemorating the bicentenary of European settlement in Australia. The note depicted on one side a young male Aboriginal person in body paint, with other elements of Aboriginal culture. On the reverse side was the ship &quot;Supply&quot; from the First Fleet, with a background of Sydney Cove, as well as a group of people to illustrate the diverse backgrounds from which Australia has evolved over 200 years.

The first polymer series was rolled out starting 1992 and featured the following persons:

* The $100 note features world-renowned soprano Dame Nellie Melba (1861–1931), and the distinguished soldier, engineer and administrator General Sir John Monash (1865–1931).
* The $50 note features Aboriginal writer and inventor David Unaipon (1872–1967), and Australia&#x27;s first female parliamentarian, Edith Cowan (1861–1932).
* The $20 note features the founder of the world&#x27;s first aerial medical service (the Royal Flying Doctor Service), the Reverend John Flynn (1880–1951), and Mary Reibey (1777–1855), who arrived in Australia as a convict in 1792 and went on to become a successful shipping magnate and philanthropist.
* The $10 note features the poets Banjo Paterson (1864–1941) and Dame Mary Gilmore (1865–1962). This note incorporates micro-printed excerpts of Paterson&#x27;s and Gilmore&#x27;s work.
* The $5 note features Queen Elizabeth II and Parliament House, Canberra, the national capital.

A special centenary issue of the $5 note in 2001 featured Sir Henry Parkes and Catherine Helen Spence. In 2015–2016 there were petitions to feature Fred Hollows on the upgraded $5 note, but failed to push through when the new note was introduced on 1 September 2016.

Australia also prints polymer banknotes for a number of other countries through Note Printing Australia, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Note Printing Australia prints polymer notes or simply supplies the polymer substrate for a growing number of other countries including Bangladesh, Brunei, Chile, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Many other countries are showing a strong interest in the new technology.

=== Second polymer series ===
On 27 September 2012, the Reserve Bank of Australia stated that it had ordered work on a project to upgrade the current banknotes. The upgraded banknotes would incorporate a number of new future proof security features and include tactile features like Braille dots for ease of use of the visually impaired. All persons featured on the first polymer series were retained on the second polymer series. However, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the government has announced that the $5 note will be replaced with a design reflecting Indigenous history and culture.

== Exchange rates ==
=== Exchange rate history ===

Prior to 1983, Australia maintained a fixed exchange rate. The Australian pound was initially at par from 1910 with the British pound or A£1 = UK£1; from 1931 it was devalued to A£1 = 16s sterling. This reflected its historical ties as well as a view about the stability in value of the British pound.

From 1946 to 1971, Australia maintained a peg under the Bretton Woods system, a fixed exchange rate system that pegged the U.S. dollar to gold, but the Australian dollar was effectively pegged to sterling until 1967 at £1 sterling = A£1 5s = A$2.50 = US$2.80. In 1967 Australia did not follow the pound sterling devaluation and remained fixed to the U.S. dollar at A$1 = US$1.12.

With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, Australia converted the traditional peg to a fluctuating rate against the US dollar. In September 1974, Australia valued the dollar against a basket of currencies called the trade weighted index (TWI) in an effort to reduce the fluctuations associated with its tie to the US dollar. The daily TWI valuation was changed in November 1976 to a periodically adjusted valuation.

The highest valuation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was during the period of the peg to the U.S. dollar. On 9 September 1973, the peg was adjusted to US$1.4875, the fluctuation limits being changed to US$1.485–US$1.490; on both 7 December 1973 and 10 December 1973, the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers payable in foreign currencies reached its highest point of 1.4885 U.S. dollars to one dollar.

In December 1983, the Australian Labor government led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating floated the dollar, with the exchange rate reflecting the balance of payments as well as supply and demand on international money markets. The decision was made on 8 December 1983 and announced on 9 December 1983.

In the two decades that followed, its highest value relative to the US dollar was $0.881 in December 1988. The lowest ever value of the dollar after it was floated was 47.75 US cents in April 2001. It returned to above 96 US cents in June 2008, and reached 98.49 later that year. Although the value of the dollar fell significantly from this high towards the end of 2008, it gradually recovered in 2009 to 94 US cents.

On 15 October 2010, the dollar reached parity with the US dollar for the first time since becoming a freely traded currency, trading above US$1 for a few seconds. The currency then traded above parity for a sustained period of several days in November, and fluctuated around that mark into 2011. On 27 July 2011, the dollar hit a record high since floating, at $1.1080 against the US dollar. Some commentators speculated that its high value that year was related to Europe&#x27;s sovereign debt crisis, and Australia&#x27;s strong ties with material importers in Asia and in particular China.

Since the end of China&#x27;s large-scale purchases of Australian commodities in 2013, however, the Australian dollar&#x27;s value versus the US dollar has since plunged to $0.88 as of end-2013, and to as low as $0.57 in March 2020. As of 2024, it has traded at a range of $0.63 to $0.68.

=== Determinants of value ===
In 2016, the Australian dollar was the fifth most traded currency in world foreign exchange markets, accounting for 6.9% of the world&#x27;s daily share (down from 8.6% in 2013) behind the United States dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and the pound sterling.

The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders, because of the comparatively high interest rates in Australia, the relative freedom of the foreign exchange market from government intervention, the general stability of Australia&#x27;s economy and political system, and the prevailing view that the Australian dollar offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies, especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle.

Economists posit that commodity prices are the dominant driver of the Australian dollar, and this means changes in exchange rates of the Australian dollar occur in ways opposite to many other currencies. For decades, Australia&#x27;s balance of trade has depended primarily upon commodity exports such as minerals and agricultural products. This means the Australian dollar varies significantly during the business cycle, rallying during global booms as Australia exports raw materials, and falling during recessions as mineral prices slump or when domestic spending overshadows the export earnings outlook. This movement is in the opposite direction to other reserve currencies, which tend to be stronger during market slumps as traders move value from falling stocks into cash.

The Australian dollar is a reserve currency and one of the most traded currencies in the world. Other factors in its popularity include a relative lack of central bank intervention, and general stability of the Australian economy and government. In January 2011 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Alexey Ulyukaev announced that the Central Bank of Russia would begin keeping Australian dollar reserves.

== Legal tender ==
===Within Australia===
Australian notes are legal tender throughout Australia by virtue of section 36(1) of the &quot;Reserve Bank Act 1959&quot; without an amount limit. Section 16 of the &quot;Currency Act 1965&quot; similarly provides that Australian coins intended for general circulation are also legal tender, but only for the following amounts:
* 1c and 2c coins (withdrawn from circulation from February 1992, but still legal tender): for payments not exceeding 20c
* 5c, 10c, 20c and 50c (of any combination): for payments not exceeding $5
* $1 coins: for payments not exceeding $10
* $2 coins: for payments not exceeding $20
* Non-circulating $10 coins: for payments not exceeding $100
* Coins of other denominations: no lower limit

However, being legal tender does not necessarily oblige businesses to accept cash. The Reserve Bank states that businesses can set commercial terms for a transaction that requires the use of a non-cash payment. However, a business may technically be required to accept cash if they are taken to court, but this is usually not a viable option for consumers.

===Outside Australia===
Australian notes and coins are also legal tender in the independent sovereign states of Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. Nauru never had its own currency. Tuvalu and Kiribati additionally had their respective Tuvaluan and Kiribati dollars at par with the Australian dollar. They are legal tender in their respective countries but not in Australia. However, both countries no longer produce coinage since the 1990s and have never produced their own banknotes. As a result, the Australian dollar is the dominant currency in both countries.

Tuvalu also issues non-circulating commemorative bullion coins produced by the Perth Mint.

<text>A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser. They are stored as the URL of a bookmark in a web browser or as a hyperlink on a web page. Bookmarklets are usually small snippets of JavaScript executed when user clicks on them. When clicked, bookmarklets can perform a wide variety of operations, such as running a search query from selected text or extracting data from a table.

Another name for &quot;bookmarklet&quot; is favelet or favlet, derived from &quot;favorites&quot; (synonym of bookmark).

== History ==

Steve Kangas of bookmarklets.com coined the word &quot;bookmarklet&quot; when he started to create short scripts based on a suggestion in Netscape&#x27;s JavaScript guide. Before that, Tantek Çelik called these scripts &quot;favelets&quot; and used that word as early as on 6 September 2001 (personal email). Brendan Eich, who developed JavaScript at Netscape, gave this account of the origin of bookmarklets:

The increased implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) in websites has caused problems with bookmarklet execution and usage (2013-2015), with some suggesting that this hails the end or death of bookmarklets. William Donnelly created a work-around solution for this problem (in the specific instance of loading, referencing and using JavaScript library code) in early 2015 using a Greasemonkey userscript (Firefox / Pale Moon browser add-on extension) and a simple bookmarklet-userscript communication protocol. It allows (library-based) bookmarklets to be executed on any and all websites, including those using CSP and having an https:// URI scheme. Note, however, that if/when browsers support disabling/disallowing inline script execution using CSP, and if/when websites begin to implement that feature, it will &quot;break&quot; this &quot;fix&quot;.

== Concept ==

Web browsers use URIs for the codice_1 attribute of the &lt;a&gt; tag and for bookmarks. The URI scheme, such as codice_2 or codice_3, and which generally specifies the protocol, determines the format of the rest of the string. Browsers also implement codice_4 URIs that to a parser is just like any other URI. The browser recognizes the specified codice_5 scheme and treats the rest of the string as a JavaScript program which is then executed. The expression result, if any, is treated as the HTML source code for a new page displayed in place of the original.

The executing script has access to the current page, which it may inspect and change. If the script returns an undefined type (rather than, for example, a string), the browser will not load a new page, with the result that the script simply runs against the current page content. This permits changes such as in-place font size and color changes without a page reload.

An immediately invoked function that returns no value or an expression preceded by the codice_6 operator will prevent the browser from attempting to parse the result of the evaluation as a snippet of HTML markup:

javascript:(function(){
 //Statements returning a non-undefined type, e.g. assignments


== Usage ==

Bookmarklets are saved and used as normal bookmarks. As such, they are simple &quot;one-click&quot; tools which add functionality to the browser. For example, they can:

* Modify the appearance of a web page within the browser (&quot;e.g.&quot;, change font size, background color, etc.)
* Extract data from a web page (&quot;e.g.&quot;, hyperlinks, images, text, etc.)
* Remove redirects from (e.g. Google) search results, to show the actual target URL 
* Submit the current page to a blogging service such as Posterous, link-shortening service such as bit.ly, or bookmarking service such as Delicious
* Query a search engine or online encyclopedia with highlighted text or by a dialog box
* Submit the current page to a link validation service or translation service
* Set commonly chosen configuration options when the page itself provides no way to do this
* Control HTML5 audio and video playback parameters such as speed, position, toggling looping, and showing/hiding playback controls, the first of which can be adjusted beyond HTML5 players&#x27; typical range setting.

===Installation===

&quot;Installing&quot; a bookmarklet allows you to quickly access and run JavaScript programs with a single click from your browser&#x27;s bookmarks bar. Follow these detailed steps to install a bookmarklet:

====Method 1: Creating a New Bookmark====
# Open Your Browser: Launch the browser where you want to add the bookmarklet.
# Add a New Bookmark: 
## Navigate to the bookmarks manager. In most browsers, this can be accessed by pressing codice_7 or by selecting &#x27;Bookmarks&#x27; from the browser menu and then choosing &#x27;Bookmark manager&#x27;.
## Right-click in the bookmarks bar or the folder where you want to add the bookmarklet and select &#x27;Add new bookmark&#x27; or &#x27;Add page&#x27;.
# Configure the Bookmark:
## In the &#x27;Name&#x27; field, enter a descriptive name for your bookmarklet to help you identify its function.
## In the &#x27;URL&#x27; field, paste the JavaScript code provided for the bookmarklet. Ensure that it starts with codice_4 followed by the code snippet.
# Save the Bookmark: Click &#x27;Save&#x27; or &#x27;Done&#x27; to add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar or folder.

====Method 2: Dragging and Dropping====
# Locate the Bookmarklet Link: Find the bookmarklet link provided on a webpage. This link will typically appear as a clickable button or link labeled with the function of the bookmarklet.
# Drag the Bookmarklet to Your Bookmarks Bar:
## Click and hold the bookmarklet link.
## Drag it directly onto your bookmarks bar. Some browsers might show a placeholder or highlight where the bookmarklet will be placed.
## Release the mouse button to drop the bookmarklet into place.
# Confirmation: The bookmarklet should now appear on your bookmarks bar, ready for use.

===Running the Bookmarklet===
To use the bookmarklet, simply click on its icon or name in your bookmarks bar. The JavaScript code will execute immediately on the current webpage you are viewing. Make sure the webpage is fully loaded before using the bookmarklet for optimal performance.

====Tips====
* Security Warning: Be cautious about adding bookmarklets from untrusted sources as they run JavaScript code that could potentially affect your browsing security or privacy.
* Compatibility: While most modern browsers support bookmarklets, the functionality may vary. Check your browser’s documentation for any specific instructions or limitations.

===Example===
This example bookmarklet performs a Wikipedia search on any highlighted text in the web browser window. In normal use, the following JavaScript code would be installed to a bookmark in a browser bookmarks toolbar. From then on, after selecting any text, clicking the bookmarklet performs the search.

javascript:(function() {
function se(d) {
 return d.selection ? d.selection.createRange().text : d.getSelection()
var s = se(document); 
for (var i=0; i&lt;frames.length &amp;&amp; (s==null || s==&quot;); i++) s = se(frames[i].document); 
if (!s || s==&quot;) s = prompt(&#x27;Enter%20search%20terms%20for%20Wikipedia&#x27;,&quot;); 
open(&#x27;https://en.wikipedia.org&#x27; + (s ? &#x27;/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;search=&#x27; + encodeURIComponent(s) : &quot;)).focus();


Bookmarklets can modify the location, e.g. to save a web page to the Wayback Machine,

javascript:location.href=&#x27;https://web.archive.org/save/&#x27;+document.location.href;
Open a new web browser window or tab, e.g. to show the source of a web resource if the web browser supports the view-source URI scheme,

javascript:void(window.open(&#x27;view-source:&#x27;+location));
Show info related to the current URL, e.g.,

javascript:alert(&#x27;\tdocument.URL\n&#x27;+document.URL+&#x27;\n\tdocument.lastModified\n&#x27;+document.lastModified+&#x27;\n\tlocation\n&#x27;+location);

<text>Andrew Barton &quot;Banjo&quot; Paterson, (17 February 18645 February 1941) was an Australian bush poet, journalist and author, widely considered one of the greatest writers of Australia&#x27;s colonial period.

Born in rural New South Wales, Paterson worked as a lawyer before transitioning into literature, where he quickly gained recognition for capturing the life of the Australian bush. A representative of the Bulletin School of Australian literature, Paterson wrote many of his best known poems for the nationalist journal &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, including &quot;Clancy of the Overflow&quot; (1889) and &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; (1890). His 1895 ballad &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; is regarded widely as Australia&#x27;s unofficial national anthem and, according to the National Film and Sound Archive, has been recorded more than any other Australian song.

==Early life==

Andrew Barton Paterson was born on 17 February 1864 at the property &quot;Narrambla&quot;, near Orange, New South Wales, the eldest son of Andrew Bogle Paterson, a Scottish immigrant from Lanarkshire, and Australian-born Rose Isabella Barton, related to the future first prime minister of Australia, Edmund Barton. Paterson&#x27;s family lived on the isolated Buckinbah Station near Yeoval NSW until he was five when his father lost his wool clip in a flood and was forced to sell up. When Paterson&#x27;s uncle John Paterson died, his family took over John Paterson&#x27;s farm in Illalong, near Yass, close to the main route between Melbourne and Sydney. Bullock teams, Cobb and Co coaches and drovers were familiar sights to him. He also saw horsemen from the Murrumbidgee River area and Snowy Mountains country take part in picnic races and polo matches, which led to his fondness of horses and inspired his writings.

Paterson&#x27;s early education came from a governess, but when he was able to ride a pony, he was taught at the bush school at Binalong. In 1874 Paterson was sent to Sydney Grammar School, performing well both as a student and a sportsman. During this time, he lived in a cottage called Rockend, in the suburb of Gladesville. The cottage is now listed on the Register of the National Estate and New South Wales State Heritage Register. He left the prestigious school at 16 after failing an examination for a scholarship to the University of Sydney.

==Career==

Paterson was a law clerk with a Sydney-based firm headed by Herbert Salwey, and was admitted as a solicitor in 1886. In the years he practised as a solicitor, he also started writing. From 1885, he began submitting and having poetry published in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, a literary journal with a nationalist focus. His earliest work was a poem criticising the British war in the Sudan, which also had Australian participation. Over the next decade, the influential journal provided an important platform for Paterson&#x27;s work, which appeared under the pseudonym of &quot;The Banjo&quot;, the name of his favourite horse. As one of its most popular writers through the 1890s, he formed friendships with other significant writers in Australian literature, such as E.J. Brady, Harry &quot;Breaker&quot; Morant, Will H. Ogilvie, and Henry Lawson. In particular, Paterson became engaged in a friendly rivalry of verse with Lawson about the allure of bush life.

===Journalism===

Paterson became a war correspondent for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and &quot;The Age&quot; during the Second Boer War, sailing for South Africa in October 1899. There he met fellow war correspondents Winston Churchill and Rudyard Kipling as well as British army leaders Kitchener, Roberts and Haig.

His graphic accounts of the relief of Kimberley, surrender of Bloemfontein (the first correspondent to ride in) and the capture of Pretoria attracted the attention of the press in Britain. An untouched box of chocolates, created by the British company Cadburys for Queen Victoria as a 1900 New Year&#x27;s gift for troops serving in South Africa, was discovered in Paterson&#x27;s papers at the National Library of Australia in 2020. He also was a correspondent during the Boxer Rebellion, where he met George &quot;Chinese&quot; Morrison and later wrote about his meeting. He was editor of Samuel Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Evening News&quot; from 1903 to 1908, and his &quot;Town and Country Journal&quot; 1907 to 1908.

===Hiatus and military service===
In 1908 after a trip to the United Kingdom he decided to abandon journalism and writing and moved with his family to a property near Yass.

In World War I, Paterson failed to become a correspondent covering the fighting in Flanders, but did become an ambulance driver with the Australian Voluntary Hospital, Wimereux, France. He returned to Australia early in 1915 and, as an honorary vet, travelled on three voyages with horses to Africa, China and Egypt. He was commissioned in the 2nd Remount Unit, Australian Imperial Force on 18 October 1915, serving initially in France where he was wounded and reported missing in July 1916 and latterly as commanding officer of the unit based in Cairo, Egypt. He was repatriated to Australia and discharged from the army having risen to the rank of major in April 1919. His wife had joined the Red Cross and worked in an ambulance unit near her husband.

==Later life and death ==

Just as he returned to Australia, the third collection of his poetry, &quot;Saltbush Bill JP&quot;, was published and he continued to publish verse, short stories and essays while continuing to write for the weekly &quot;Truth&quot;. Paterson also wrote on rugby league football in the 1920s for the &quot;Sydney Sportsman&quot;.

In December 1938 Paterson was appointed Commander of the British Empire (CBE).

He died on 5 February 1941.

==Personal life==

On 8 April 1903, he married Alice Emily Walker, of Tenterfield Station, in St Stephen&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, in Tenterfield, New South Wales. Their first home was in Queen Street, Woollahra. The Patersons had two children, Grace (born in 1904) and Hugh (born in 1906).

Paterson had been previously engaged to Sarah Riley for eight years, but this was abruptly called off in 1895 following a visit to her at Dagworth Station in Queensland where she was visiting the Macpherson family. It was here that Paterson met his fiancée&#x27;s best friend from school days, Christina Macpherson, who composed the music for which he then wrote the lyrics of the famous Waltzing Matilda. However, following this collaboration Paterson was suddenly asked to leave the property, leading historians to conclude that he was a womanizer and had engaged in a scandalous romantic liaison with Macpherson.

Paterson died of a heart attack in Sydney on 5 February 1941 aged 76.

==Works==

The publication of The Man from Snowy River and five other ballads in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; made &quot;The Banjo&quot; a household name. In 1895, Angus &amp; Robertson published these poems as a collection of Australian verse. The book sold 5000 copies in the first four months of publication.

In 1895, Paterson headed north to Dagworth station near Winton, Queensland. Travelling with fiancée, Sarah Riley, they met with her old school friend, Christina Macpherson, who had recently attended a race at Warrnambool in Victoria. She had heard a band playing a tune there, which became stuck in her head and replayed it for Paterson on the autoharp. The melody also resonated with him and propelled him to write 
&quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; While there has been much debate about what inspired the words, the song became one of his most widely known and sung ballads.

In addition, he wrote the lyrics for songs with piano scores, such as &quot;The Daylight is Dying&quot; and &quot;Last Week&quot;. These were also published by Angus &amp; Robertson between the years 1895 to 1899. In 1905, the same publishers released &quot;Old Bush Songs&quot;, a collection of bush ballads Paterson had been assembling since 1895.

Although for most of his adult life, Paterson lived and worked in Sydney, his poems mostly presented a highly romantic view of the bush and the iconic figure of the bushman. Influenced by the work of another Australian poet, John Farrell, his representation of the bushman as a tough, independent and heroic underdog became the ideal qualities underpinning the national character. His work is often compared to the prose of Henry Lawson, particularly the seminal work, &quot;The Drover&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which presented a considerably less romantic view of the harshness of rural existence of the late 19th century.

Paterson authored two novels; &quot;In No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (later titled &quot;An Outback Marriage&quot;) (1900) and &quot;The Shearer&#x27;s Colt&quot; (1936), wrote many short stories; &quot;Three Elephant Power and Other Stories&quot; (1917), and wrote a book based on his experiences as a war reporter, &quot;Happy Dispatches&quot; (1934). He also wrote a book for children, &quot;The Animals Noah Forgot&quot; (1933).

Contemporary recordings of many of Paterson&#x27;s well known poems have been released by Jack Thompson, who played Clancy in the 1982 film adaptation of &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;. While having no connection to the movie, an Australian television series of the same name was broadcast in the 1990s.

Media reports in August 2008 stated that a previously unknown poem had been found in a war diary written during the Boer War.

==Legacy==
Banjo Paterson&#x27;s image appears on the $10 note, along with an illustration inspired by &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot; and, as part of the copy-protection microprint, the text of the poem itself.

Artist Violet Bowring painted a portrait of her one-time neighbour Banjo Paterson, now hanging in Sydney’s Australian Club, and used as the cover illustration of a book &quot;The Best of Banjo Paterson&quot;, compiled by Walter Stone, published in 1977.

In 1981 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post.

A.B. Paterson College, at Arundel on the Gold Coast, Australia, is named after Paterson.

The A. B. &quot;Banjo&quot; Paterson Library at Sydney Grammar School was named after Paterson.

The Festival of Arts in Orange, New South Wales, presents a biennial Banjo Paterson Award for poetry and one-act plays and there is also an annual National Book Council Banjo Award. Orange also has an annual Banjo Paterson Poetry Festival.

In 1983, a rendition of &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot; by country-and-western singer Slim Dusty was the first song broadcast by astronauts to Earth.

He topped the list of The Greatest of All - Our 50 Top Australians published in &quot;The Australian&quot; on 27 June 2013.

Hall, and Roderick MacKinnon, Fields Medalist Edward Witten, Turing Award Winner Leslie Lamport, and co-creators of the television show &quot;Friends&quot; David Crane and Marta Kauffman.

==History==

===Founding===

Middlesex University was a medical school located in Waltham, Massachusetts, that was at the time the only medical school in Massachusetts that did not impose a quota on Jews. The founder, John Hall Smith, died in 1944. Smith&#x27;s will stipulated that the school should go to any group willing to use it to establish a non-sectarian university. Within two years, Middlesex University was on the brink of financial collapse. The school had not been able to secure accreditation by the American Medical Association, which Smith partially attributed to institutional antisemitism in the American Medical Association.

Smith&#x27;s son, C. Ruggles Smith, was desperate for a way to save something of Middlesex University. He learned of a New York committee headed by Israel Goldstein that was seeking a campus to establish a Jewish-sponsored secular university. Smith approached Goldstein with a proposal to give the Middlesex campus and charter to Goldstein&#x27;s committee, in the hope that his committee might &quot;possess the apparent ability to reestablish the School of Medicine on an approved basis.&quot; While Goldstein was concerned about being saddled with a failing medical school, he was excited about the opportunity to secure a &quot;campus not far from New York, the premier Jewish community in the world, and only from Boston, one of the important Jewish population centers.&quot; Goldstein agreed to accept Smith&#x27;s offer, proceeding to recruit George Alpert, a Boston lawyer with fundraising experience as national co-chairman of the United Jewish Appeal.

Alpert had worked his way through Boston University School of Law and co-founded the firm of Alpert and Alpert. Alpert&#x27;s firm had a long association with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, of which he was to become president from 1956 to 1961. Alpert was chairman of Brandeis from 1946 to 1954, and a trustee from 1946 until his death. By February 5, 1946, Goldstein had recruited Albert Einstein, whose involvement drew national attention to the nascent university. Einstein believed the university would attract the best young people in all fields, satisfying a real need.

In March 1946, Goldstein said the foundation had raised $10 million that it would use to open the school by the following year. The foundation purchased Middlesex University&#x27;s land and buildings for two million dollars. The charter of this operation was transferred to the foundation along with the campus. The founding organization was announced in August and named The Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, Inc. The new school would be a Jewish-sponsored secular university open to students and faculty of all races and religions.
The trustees offered to name the university after Einstein in the summer of 1946, but Einstein declined, and on July 16, 1946, the board decided the university would be named after Louis Brandeis.

Einstein threatened to sever ties with the foundation on September 2, 1946. Believing the venture could not succeed without Einstein, Goldstein quickly agreed to resign, and Einstein recanted. Einstein&#x27;s near-departure was publicly denied. Goldstein said that, despite his resignation, he would continue to solicit donations for the foundation. On November 1, 1946, the foundation announced that the new university would be named Brandeis University, after Louis D. Brandeis, associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. By the end of 1946, the foundation said it had raised over five hundred thousand dollars, and two months later it said it had doubled that amount.

The Brandeis board felt it was in no position to make the investment in the medical school that would enable it to receive accreditation, and closed it in 1947. Einstein wanted Middlesex University&#x27;s veterinary school&#x27;s standards to be improved before expanding to the school, while others in the foundation wanted to simply close the veterinary school, which, by the winter of 1947, had an enrollment of just about 100 students. A professional study of the veterinary school recommended dismissing certain instructors and requiring end-of-year examinations for the students, but the foundation declined to enact any of the recommendations, to the dismay of Einstein and a couple of the foundation&#x27;s trustees.

In early June 1947, Einstein made a final break with the foundation. The veterinary school was closed, despite students&#x27; protests and demonstrations. According to George Alpert, a lawyer responsible for much of the organizational effort, Einstein had wanted to offer the presidency of the school to left-wing scholar Harold Laski, someone that Alpert had characterized as &quot;a man utterly alien to American principles of democracy, tarred with the Communist brush.&quot; He said, &quot;I can compromise on any subject but one: that one is Americanism.&quot; Two of the foundation&#x27;s trustees, S. Ralph Lazrus and Otto Nathan, quit the foundation at the same time as Einstein. In response, Alpert said that Lazrus and Nathan had tried to give Brandeis University a &quot;radical, political orientation.&quot; Alpert also criticized Lazrus&#x27; lack of fundraising success and Nathan&#x27;s failure to organize an educational advisory committee. Einstein said he, Lazrus, and Nathan &quot;have always been and have always acted in complete harmony.&quot;

===Opening===
On April 26, 1948, Brandeis University announced that Abram L. Sachar, chairman of the National Hillel Commission, had been chosen as Brandeis&#x27; first president. Sachar promised that Brandeis University would follow Louis Brandeis&#x27; principles of academic integrity and service. He also promised that students and faculty would never be chosen based on quotas of &quot;genetic or ethnic or economic distribution&quot; because choices based on quotas &quot;are based on the assumption that there are standard population strains, on the belief that the ideal American must look and act like an eighteenth-century Puritan, that the melting pot of America must mold all who live here into such a pattern.&quot; Students who applied to the school were not asked their race, religion, or ancestry.

Brandeis decided its undergraduate instruction would not be organized with traditional departments or divisions, and instead it would have four schools, namely the School of General Studies, the School of Social Studies, the School of Humanities, and the School of Science. On October 14, 1948, Brandeis University received its first freshman class of 107 students. They were taught by thirteen instructors in eight buildings on a campus. Students came from 28 states and six foreign countries. The library was formerly a barn, students slept in the former medical school building and two army barracks, and the cafeteria was where the medical school had stored cadavers. Historians Elinor and Robert Slater later called the opening of Brandeis one of the great moments in Jewish history.

===Early years===
Eleanor Roosevelt joined the board of trustees in 1949. Joseph M. Proskauer joined the board in 1950. Construction of on-campus dormitories began in March 1950 with the goal of ninety percent of students living on campus. 

Construction on an athletic field began in May 1950. Brandeis&#x27; football team played its first game on September 30, 1950, a road win against Maine Maritime Academy. Its first varsity game was on September 29, 1951, with a home loss against the University of New Hampshire. Its first varsity win was a score of 24–13, an away game at Hofstra University on October 6, 1951. Brandeis Stadium opened in time for a home win against American International College on October 13, 1951. During its first season, the football team won four and lost four games during the regular season and then lost to the University of Tampa in a post-season game. Construction of a 2,000-seat amphitheater began in February 1952.

The state legislature of Massachusetts authorized Brandeis to award master&#x27;s degrees, doctorate degrees, and honorary degrees in 1951. Brandeis&#x27; first graduating class of 101 students received degrees on June 16, 1952. Leonard Bernstein, director of Brandeis&#x27; Center of Creative Arts, planned a four-day ceremony to commemorate the occasion. Held in the newly opened amphitheater, the ceremony included the world premier of Bernstein&#x27;s opera &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot;. Eleanor Roosevelt and Massachusetts Governor Paul A. Dever spoke at the commencement ceremony.

In 1953, Einstein declined the offer of an honorary degree from Brandeis, writing to Brandeis President Abram L. Sachar that &quot;what happened in the stage of preparation of Brandeis University was not at all caused by a misunderstanding and cannot be made good any more.&quot; Instead, at the graduation ceremony for Brandeis&#x27; second graduating class of 108 students, individuals given Brandeis&#x27; first honorary degrees included Illinois Senator Paul H. Douglas, Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, and Alpert. 1953 also saw the creation of the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies, one of the first academic programs in Jewish Studies at an American university. Among the founders were distinguished emigre scholars Alexander Altmann, Nathan Glatzer, and Simon Rawidowicz. Brandeis&#x27; graduate program, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, opened in fall 1954. In the same year, Brandeis became fully accredited, joining the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. As of 1954, Brandeis had 22 buildings and a campus.

In 1954, Brandeis began construction on an interfaith center consisting of separate Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish chapels. Designed by the architectural firm of Harrison &amp; Abramovitz, the three chapels surrounded a natural pond. Brandeis announced that no official chaplains would be named, and attendance at chapel services would not be required. The Roman Catholic chapel was named Bethlehem, meaning house of bread, and it was dedicated on September 9, 1955. Dedicated on September 11, 1955, the Jewish chapel was named in memory of Mendel and Leah Berlin, parents of Boston surgeon David D. Berlin. Named in memory of Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, the Protestant chapel was dedicated on October 30, 1955.

In 1956, Brandeis received a one-million-dollar donation from New York industrialist Jack A. Goldfarb to build a library. The building, named the Bertha and Jacob Goldfarb Library in his honor, was designed by Harrison &amp; Abramovitz, a firm which designed many campus buildings in the 1950s. Built of brick and glass, the library was designed to hold 750,000 volumes.

A nine-foot bronze statue of Justice Louis D. Brandeis is a campus landmark. The sculpture, created by sculptor Robert Berks, was unveiled in 1956 in honor of the 100th anniversary of Brandeis&#x27; birth. Berks&#x27; wife Dorothy had been the Justice&#x27;s personal assistant for 39 years and wore his actual robes to model the statue.

After Brandeis University awarded an honorary doctorate to Israeli Premier David Ben-Gurion in 1960, Jordan boycotted Brandeis University, announcing that it would not issue currency permits to Jordanian students at Brandeis.

Beginning in fall 1959, singer Eddie Fisher established two scholarships at the university, one for classical and one for popular music, in the name of Eddie Cantor.

On May 16, 1960, Brandeis announced it would discontinue its varsity football team. President Abram Sachar pointed to the cost of the team as one reason for the decision. Brandeis&#x27; football coach Benny Friedman said it was difficult to recruit football players who were also excellent students with so much competition in the Boston metropolitan area. Brandeis said the discontinuation of varsity football would allow it to expand intercollegiate activity in other sports. During its nine years of varsity play, Brandeis&#x27; football team recorded 34 wins, 33 losses, and four ties. In 1985, Brandeis was elected to membership in the Association of American Universities, an association that focuses on graduate education and research.

=== 1960s: Countercultural epicenter ===
Brandeis became an epicenter of radical student activism and anti–Vietnam War protests during the counterculture of the 1960s. It was the National Student Strike Information Center during the student strike of 1970.

==== Student takeover of Ford Hall ====
On January 8, 1969, about 70 black students entered then-student-center, Ford Hall, ejected everyone else from the building, and refused to leave. The students&#x27; demands included the hiring of more black faculty members, increasing black student enrollment from four percent to ten percent of the student body, establishing an independent department on African American studies, and an increase in scholarships for black students. Over 200 white students staged a sit-in in the lobby of the administration building. President Morris B. Abram said that, although he recognized &quot;the deep frustration and anger which black students here and all over the country feel at what must seem—and often is—the indifference and duplicity of white men in relation to blacks&quot;, the students&#x27; actions were an affront to the university. The faculty condemned the students&#x27; actions as well. On the fourth day of the protest, the Middlesex Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the students to leave Ford Hall. While Abram did not allow the order to forcibly remove the students from Ford Hall to be enforced, 65 students had been suspended for their actions. On January 18, the black students exited Ford Hall, ending the eleven-day occupation of the building. There had been no violence or destruction of property during the occupation, and Brandeis gave the students amnesty for their actions. Ronald Walters became the first chair of Afro-American studies at Brandeis later the same year. Ford Hall was demolished in August 2000 to make way for the Shapiro Campus Center, which was opened and dedicated October 3, 2002.

=== Late 20th century: Institutional crisis ===

In the 1970s, Brandeis faced a financial crisis as donations from American Jews decreased as they turned toward support for Israel and other causes.

Samuel O. Thier, president from 1991 to 1994, helped to restabilize the university.

In 1998, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl addressed the university as commencement speaker and dedicated the Center for German and European established the previous year.

=== 21st century ===
In January 2007, former President Jimmy Carter spoke at the university against the backdrop of controversy over his book after being invited by students despite some campus opposition. His speech was followed by a rebuttal remarks from Alan Dershowitz. Later that spring Norman Finkelstein and Daniel Pipes were invited to speak on campus by separate student groups.

In December 2007 former President Bill Clinton spoke on campus and launched the Eli J. Segal Leadership program.
In 2014, Brandeis announced it would offer an honorary doctorate to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, &quot;a staunch supporter of women&#x27;s rights&quot;, and an outspoken campaigner against female genital mutilation, honor killing and Islamic extremism in general. After complaints from the Council on American–Islamic Relations and internal consultation with faculty and students, Brandeis publicly withdrew the offer, citing that Ali&#x27;s statements condemning Islam were &quot;inconsistent with the University&#x27;s core values&quot;. 87 out of 511 faculty members at Brandeis signed a letter to the university president.

The university announced that the decision to withdraw the invitation was made after a discussion between Ayaan Ali and President Frederick Lawrence, stating that &quot;She is a compelling public figure and advocate for women&#x27;s rights ... but we cannot overlook certain of her past statements&quot;. According to Brandeis, Ali was never invited to speak at commencement, she was only invited to receive an honorary degree. Ali said that Brandeis&#x27; decision surprised her because Brandeis said they did not know what she had said in the past even though her speeches were publicly available on the internet, calling it a &quot;feeble excuse&quot;. Ali stated that the university&#x27;s decision was motivated in part by fear of offending Muslims. She argued that the &quot;spirit of free expression&quot; referred to in the Brandeis statement has been betrayed and stifled.

While some commentators such as Abdullah Antepli, the Muslim chaplain and adjunct faculty of Islamic Studies at Duke University, applauded the decision and warned against &quot;making renegades into heroes,&quot; other academic commentators such as the University of Chicago&#x27;s Jerry Coyne and the George Mason University Foundation Professor David Bernstein criticized the decision as an attack on academic values such as freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence from religious pressure groups.

In 2017, a planned student performance of a play called &quot;Buyer Beware&quot; about Lenny Bruce by Brandeis alumnus Michael Weller was first postponed over concerns about racism, then prompting the playwright to withdraw the play in favor of a staging it elsewhere. 

The university adopted official free expression principles in 2018. A new presidential taskforce to review the university&#x27;s free expression guidelines was set up in 2024.

In 2021, a student group&#x27;s &quot;oppressive language list&quot; was removed from the university website after it got outside attention for its suggestion to avoid the term &quot;trigger warning.&quot;

President Ronald Liebowitz announced his resignation in September 2024 following a faculty no-confidence vote amid budget concerns and controversy over the handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus -- the fifth university president to step down that year at least in part in connection with the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

===Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies===
In 1980, Brandeis University established the Maurice and Marilyn Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies, the first academic center devoted to the study of Jewish life in the United States. The Cohen Center&#x27;s work spans basic research on Jewish identity to applied educational evaluation studies. The center&#x27;s recent signature studies include research with participants in Taglit-Birthright Israel, investigations of synagogue transformation, analyses of Jewish summer camping, and socio-demographic studies of Jewish communities throughout the United States. CMJS research has altered the understanding of contemporary Jewish life and the role of Jewish institutions in the United States.

===Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism===
The Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism was launched in September 2004 as the first investigative reporting center based at a United States university. It was named for founding benefactors Elaine Schuster and Gerald Schuster.

The institute&#x27;s major projects were:

The first mission of SSRI was to interpret the inherent problems with the National Jewish Population Survey of 2000 (NJPS). SSRI has done a Jewish Population Survey of the Greater Boston area, the results of which were released on November 9, 2006.

The Institute collects and organizes existing socio-demographic data from private, communal, and government sources and will conduct local and national studies of the character of American Jewry and Jewish organizations. The work of the institute is done by a multidisciplinary staff of faculty and scholars, working with undergraduate and graduate students, and augmented by visiting scholars and consultants. The institute works in close collaboration with the Maurice and Marilyn Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies.

===Women&#x27;s Studies Research Center===
The WSRC, located in the Epstein Building, was founded in 2001 by Professor Emerita of Sociology Shulamit Reinharz. It is home to three general programs:

* The Student-Scholar Partnership Program, which pairs Brandeis University undergraduate students with WSRC scholars for semester-long, paid research assistantships
* The Arts Program, which oversees the Kniznick Gallery, devoted to feminist artwork

===Wien International Scholarship===
The Wien International Scholarship Program was instituted by Brandeis University for international undergraduate students. It was established in 1958 by Lawrence A. and Mae Wien. The family had three objectives: to further international understanding, to provide foreign students an opportunity to study in the United States, and to enrich the intellectual and cultural life at Brandeis. The Wien Scholarship offers full or partial tuition awards; these awards are need-based and require the applicants to present outstanding academic and personal achievement. Each year, the recipients of the scholarship take a week-long tour of a destination in the United States. In previous years, the students have visited the United Nations in New York City, and did relief work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. In April 2008, the university hosted a three-day-long celebration for the 50th anniversary of the program.

===Reputation and rankings===

==Research==
Brandeis is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity&quot;. In FY 2017, Brandeis spent $68.4 million on research and was ranked 174 in the nation by total R&amp;D expenditure. These include sponsored research funds from sources including the National Institutes of Health; the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Health and Human Services as well as a range of foundations.

The university&#x27;s Division of Science encompasses seven departments (Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology), five interdepartmental programs (Biochemistry &amp; Biophysics, Biological Physics, Biotechnology, Genetic Counseling, Molecular &amp; Cell Biology, and Neuroscience), six science centers (Ashton Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory, National Center for Behavioral Genomics, Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neurobiology, Benjamin and Mae Volen National Center for Complex Systems, and W.M. Keck Institute for Cellular Visualization), and more than 50 laboratories that investigate fundamental life processes ranging from the structure and function of individual macromolecules to the mechanisms that control the behavior of whole organisms.

Faculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates investigate areas such as neuronal development and plasticity, signal transduction, immunology, the molecular basis of genetic recombination, and the three-dimensional structure of macromolecular assemblies. Brandeis science faculty include 12 National Academy of Science members, three Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators, two Howard Hughes Medical Institute professors, two MacArthur Foundation Fellows, and 15 American Association for the Advancement of Sciences Fellows.

Brandeis undergraduate students have the opportunity to work with faculty, postdoctoral students and graduate students to conduct original laboratory research. Brandeis also offers a number of funding resources to support independent undergraduate research projects. In 2008, Brandeis established a Science Posse program, a merit-based scholarship program that admits students based on their academic, leadership and communication skills, and their interests in studying science. Founded by Irving Epstein, the Henry F. Fischbach Professor of Chemistry, and supported by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant, the Science Posse program is focused on increasing the recruitment and retention of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences. The program recruits, trains, and provides mentoring and other services for 10 inner-city Atlanta students each year who are interested in studying science at the undergraduate level.

In 2014, the National Science Foundation renewed funding for Brandeis&#x27; Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), which was established in 2008. This center supports interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary materials research and education that address fundamental problems in science and engineering that are important to society. In particular, the center uses simplified components to create new materials that have some of the functionalities found in living organisms.

== Student life ==
The university has an active student government, the Brandeis Student Union, as well as more than 270 student organizations. Fraternities and sororities are not officially recognized by Brandeis University, as they are contrary to a central tenet of the university, namely, that student organizations be open to all students, with membership determined by competency or interest. According to an official handbook, &quot;exclusive or secret societies are inconsistent with the principles of openness to which the University is committed.&quot; Brandeis became the first university to ban Students for Justice in Palestine from campus, occurring shortly after a vigil hosted by SJP relating to Palestinian lives lost in the Israel-Hamas War. 

Brandeis has 11 a cappella groups, six undergraduate-run theater companies, one sketch comedy troupe (Boris&#x27; Kitchen, founded in 1987), four improv-comedy groups, and many other cultural and arts clubs, as well as student activism groups that advocate for causes including environmentalism, immigration reform, LGBTQ rights, feminism, and anti-racism. Brandeis is also home to what has been cited as one of the country&#x27;s few undergraduate-run law publications. Of particular note is the Brandeis Academic Debate and Speech Society (B.A.D.A.S.S.), which consistently ranks as one of the top 10 debate teams in the United States, and participates across the globe in the World Universities Debating Championships each year. During the 2012–2013 school year, B.A.D.A.S.S. was the second most successful team overall on the American Parliamentary Debate Association Circuit.

Cholmondeley&#x27;s coffeehouse, commonly referred to as &quot;Chums&quot;, is located in Brandeis&#x27; Usen Castle. Chums is a popular site for student performances and concerts, including Tracy Chapman, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Matt Pond PA, and Genesis (notable as their first American performance). Early footage of Chums appears in the short documentary film, &quot;Coffee House Rendezvous&quot;. Cholmondley&#x27;s is named after a notoriously ill-tempered Basset hound that was the on-campus pet for Ralph Norman, the campus photographer during the first years of Brandeis. The dog roamed the campus after dark, growling at students, often nipping at their cuffs and making a general nuisance of himself. After his death, the coffee house was named for him, not so much in remembrance but in celebration. In 2015, in an email to student workers of the coffee house, Brandeis administration announced the immediate closure of Chums Coffeehouse, leaving said student workers unemployed. After significant pushback from the student body and alumni alike, the administration determined to make the closure temporary while the space underwent renovations.

Brandeis University&#x27;s Campus Sustainability Initiative seeks to reduce the university&#x27;s environmental and climate change impact. The university&#x27;s accomplishments in the arena of sustainability include the creation of a student-organized on-campus Farmers&#x27; Market, the implementation of a single-stream recycling program, and the transition to GreenE certified wind power for 15% of the school&#x27;s electricity needs. Brandeis also offers an environmental studies academic program, which includes courses such as Greening the Ivory Tower: Improving Sustainability of Brandeis and Community, which serves as an incubator for student led sustainability projects. Student projects have included greening campus offices, running after-school environmental education programs for children in the Waltham schools, and cleaning up local streams and ponds. In addition, a student-led project in 2014 established a rooftop farm atop the Gerstenzang science building consisting of 1,500 potted milk crates.

Students also have the option of taking courses with a &quot;Community Engaged Learning&quot; (CEL) aspect. Community-engaged learning is an aspect of the university&#x27;s broad-based commitment to experiential learning.

Emergency medical services are provided by the Brandeis Emergency Medical Corps, nicknamed BEMCO, a Massachusetts-certified EMT-Basic volunteer student organization which does not charge a fee for any of its emergency services.

Security escort services are provided around the campus and into Waltham by the student-run &quot;Branvan,&quot; which runs on a daily schedule from 4:00 pm to 2:30 am on weekdays and from noon to 2:30 am on weekends.

The university is west of Boston and is accessible through Brandeis/Roberts station on the Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line, a free shuttle that services Boston and Cambridge (Harvard Square) Thursday through Sunday, the nearby Riverside subway station (above ground) on the Green Line, and the 553 MBTA bus.

==Athletics==
Brandeis fields 19 Division III varsity athletic programs. Brandeis athletic teams compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA).

Brandeis has won NCAA team championships in men&#x27;s soccer (1976) and men&#x27;s cross country (1983), as well as 24 individual titles. Brandeis teams have earned 17 NCAA Division III Tournament berths and won eight Eastern Collegiate Athletic Association (ECAC) New England crowns in the last decade. Nine teams have earned national rankings, with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer all ascending to the top 10 in the nation during that span.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSCAA/Continental Tire NCAA Division III Women&#x27;s - National - Poll 3 - September 17, 2013&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the men&#x27;s team reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament for the sixth year in a row, and reached the Final Four for the second straight year. It was the fourth straight year they finished ranked a top ten team in the country. Also earning national rankings in &#x27;13-14 were women&#x27;s cross country and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis.

Brandeis also sponsors 20 club sports. Among them, ultimate frisbee, crew, archery and women&#x27;s rugby have had success on a national level. The program&#x27;s many intramural sports are open to students, faculty and staff.

<text>A pyrometer, or radiation thermometer, is a type of remote sensing thermometer used to measure the temperature of distant objects. Various forms of pyrometers have historically existed. In the modern usage, it is a device that from a distance determines the temperature of a surface from the amount of the thermal radiation it emits, a process known as pyrometry, a type of &quot;radiometry&quot;.

The word pyrometer comes from the Greek word for fire, &quot;πῦρ&quot; (&quot;pyr&quot;), and &quot;meter&quot;, meaning to measure. The word pyrometer was originally coined to denote a device capable of measuring the temperature of an object by its incandescence, visible light emitted by a body which is at least red-hot. Infrared thermometers, can also measure the temperature of cooler objects, down to room temperature, by detecting their infrared radiation flux. Modern pyrometers are available for a wide range of wavelengths and are generally called &quot;radiation thermometers&quot;.

== Principle ==

It is based on the principle that the intensity of light received by the observer depends upon the distance of the observer from the source and the temperature of the distant source. A modern pyrometer has an optical system and a detector. The optical system focuses the thermal radiation onto the detector. The output signal of the detector (temperature &quot;T&quot;) is related to the thermal radiation or irradiance formula_1 of the target object through the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the constant of proportionality σ, called the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and the emissivity ε of the object:
:formula_2
This output is used to infer the object&#x27;s temperature from a distance, with no need for the pyrometer to be in thermal contact with the object; most other thermometers (e.g. thermocouples and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs)) are placed in thermal contact with the object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium.

Pyrometry of gases presents difficulties. These are most commonly overcome by using thin-filament pyrometry or soot pyrometry. Both techniques involve small solids in contact with hot gases.

== History ==
The term &quot;pyrometer&quot; was coined in the 1730s by Pieter van Musschenbroek, better known as the inventor of the Leyden jar. His device, of which no surviving specimens are known, may be now called a dilatometer because it measured the dilation of a metal rod.

The earliest example of a pyrometer thought to be in existence is the Hindley Pyrometer held by the London Science Museum, dating from 1752, produced for the Royal collection. The pyrometer was a well known enough instrument that it was described in some detail by the mathematician Euler in 1760.

Around 1782 potter Josiah Wedgwood invented a different type of pyrometer (or rather a pyrometric device) to measure the temperature in his kilns, which first compared the color of clay fired at known temperatures, but was eventually upgraded to measuring the shrinkage of pieces of clay, which depended on kiln temperature (see Wedgwood scale for details). Later examples used the expansion of a metal bar.

In the 1860s–1870s brothers William and Werner Siemens developed a platinum resistance thermometer, initially to measure temperature in undersea cables, but then adapted for measuring temperatures in metallurgy up to 1000 °C, hence deserving a name of a pyrometer.

Around 1890 Henry Louis Le Chatelier developed the thermoelectric pyrometer.

The first disappearing-filament pyrometer was built by L. Holborn and F. Kurlbaum in 1901. This device had a thin electrical filament between an observer&#x27;s eye and an incandescent object. The current through the filament was adjusted until it was of the same colour (and hence temperature) as the object, and no longer visible; it was calibrated to allow temperature to be inferred from the current.

The temperature returned by the vanishing-filament pyrometer and others of its kind, called brightness pyrometers, is dependent on the emissivity of the object. With greater use of brightness pyrometers, it became obvious that problems existed with relying on knowledge of the value of emissivity. Emissivity was found to change, often drastically, with surface roughness, bulk and surface composition, and even the temperature itself.

To get around these difficulties, the &quot;ratio&quot; or &quot;two-color&quot; pyrometer was developed. They rely on the fact that Planck&#x27;s law, which relates temperature to the intensity of radiation emitted at individual wavelengths, can be solved for temperature if Planck&#x27;s statement of the intensities at two different wavelengths is divided. This solution assumes that the emissivity is the same at both wavelengths and cancels out in the division. This is known as the gray-body assumption. Ratio pyrometers are essentially two brightness pyrometers in a single instrument. The operational principles of the ratio pyrometers were developed in the 1920s and 1930s, and they were commercially available in 1939.

As the ratio pyrometer came into popular use, it was determined that many materials, of which metals are an example, do not have the same emissivity at two wavelengths. For these materials, the emissivity does not cancel out, and the temperature measurement is in error. The amount of error depends on the emissivities and the wavelengths where the measurements are taken. Two-color ratio pyrometers cannot measure whether a material&#x27;s emissivity is wavelength-dependent.

To more accurately measure the temperature of real objects with unknown or changing emissivities, multiwavelength pyrometers were envisioned at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology and described in 1992. Multiwavelength pyrometers use three or more wavelengths and mathematical manipulation of the results to attempt to achieve accurate temperature measurement even when the emissivity is unknown, changing or differs according to wavelength of measurement.

== Applications ==
Pyrometers are suited especially to the measurement of moving objects or any surfaces that cannot be reached or cannot be touched. Contemporary multispectral pyrometers are suitable for measuring high temperatures inside combustion chambers of gas turbine engines with high accuracy.

Temperature is a fundamental parameter in metallurgical furnace operations. Reliable and continuous measurement of the metal temperature is essential for effective control of the operation. Smelting rates can be maximized, slag can be produced at the optimal temperature, fuel consumption is minimized and refractory life may also be lengthened. Thermocouples were the traditional devices used for this purpose, but they are unsuitable for continuous measurement because they melt and degrade.

Salt bath furnaces operate at temperatures up to 1300 °C and are used for heat treatment. At very high working temperatures with intense heat transfer between the molten salt and the steel being treated, precision is maintained by measuring the temperature of the molten salt. Most errors are caused by slag on the surface, which is cooler than the salt bath.

The &quot;tuyère pyrometer&quot; is an optical instrument for temperature measurement through the tuyeres, which are normally used for feeding air or reactants into the bath of the furnace.

A steam boiler may be fitted with a pyrometer to measure the steam temperature in the superheater.

A hot air balloon is equipped with a pyrometer for measuring the temperature at the top of the envelope in order to prevent overheating of the fabric.

Pyrometers may be fitted to experimental gas turbine engines to measure the surface temperature of turbine blades. Such pyrometers can be paired with a tachometer to tie the pyrometer output with the position of an individual turbine blade. Timing combined with a radial position encoder allows engineers to determine the temperature at exact points on blades moving past the probe.

<doc id="81234" wikidata="Q1354851" url="?curid=81234" title="John Kerr (governor-general)">
<text>Sir John Robert Kerr, (24 September 1914 – 24 March 1991) was an Australian barrister and judge who served as the 18th governor-general of Australia, in office from 1974 to 1977. He is primarily known for his involvement in the 1975 constitutional crisis, which culminated in his decision to dismiss the incumbent prime minister Gough Whitlam and appoint Malcolm Fraser as his replacement, which led to unprecedented actions in Australian federal politics.

Kerr was born in Sydney to working-class parents. He won scholarships to Fort Street Boys&#x27; High School and the University of Sydney, where he studied law. His legal career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served with the Australian Army&#x27;s Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs (DORCA) and attained the rank of colonel. After the war&#x27;s end he became the inaugural head of the Australian School of Pacific Administration. Kerr returned to the bar in 1949 and became one of Sydney&#x27;s leading industrial lawyers. He joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and was briefly an endorsed candidate for the 1951 federal election. He let his membership lapse after the party split of 1955.

Kerr served terms as president of the New South Wales Bar Association and the Law Council of Australia. He was appointed to the Commonwealth Industrial Court in 1966, later serving on territory supreme courts and as Chief Justice of New South Wales (1972–1974). On the nomination of ALP prime minister Gough Whitlam, Kerr was appointed governor-general in July 1974. The Whitlam government did not hold a majority in the Senate, and following a series of controversies in 1975, most notably the Loans Affair, the Liberal opposition leader Malcolm Fraser called on the Senate (where his coalition had a majority) to defer consideration of the supply bills in an attempt to force an early election. Kerr regarded the situation as untenable, believing the prime minister was obliged to either resign or call a general election, which Whitlam was unwilling to do.

On 11 November 1975, Kerr used his reserve powers as governor-general to dismiss Whitlam and his ministry, appointing Fraser to lead a caretaker government. He immediately granted Fraser&#x27;s request for a double dissolution, leading to a federal election that saw Whitlam and the ALP defeated in a landslide. The dismissal of the government sparked demonstrations from Whitlam&#x27;s supporters, with the anger directed at Kerr a major factor in his early retirement in December 1977 and subsequent withdrawal from public life. The propriety, legality and wisdom of his actions surrounding the dismissal have been subject to considerable debate and analysis.

==Early life==
Kerr was born in Balmain, Sydney, on 24 September 1914. He was the eldest of three children born to Laura May (née Cardwell) and Harry Kerr; his younger brother Dudley was born in 1917 and younger sister Elaine in 1926. Kerr&#x27;s parents and maternal grandparents were Australian-born, while his paternal grandparents came from Sunderland, England, arriving in Sydney in 1886. He came from a line of waterside workers—his father was a boilermaker, his grandfather was a stevedore, and his great-grandfather was a shipwright. At the time of his son&#x27;s birth, Kerr&#x27;s father was employed at the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. He was sacked three months later, but soon found work at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, which were at full capacity due to the ongoing war. He was involved in the union movement, and participated in a number of strikes, including the 1917 general strike, during which he went without pay for two months. Work at the docks became irregular after the war&#x27;s end, and he eventually rejoined the railways in 1925.

For the first two years of his life, Kerr and his parents lived with his paternal grandparents in a weatherboard cottage in Balmain. They later rented cottages in Rozelle and Dulwich Hill, buying the latter outright only in 1949. Kerr began his education at the Birchgrove Public School. He won a scholarship to attend the prestigious Fort Street Boys&#x27; High School, where he excelled academically. He topped the school in English, history, and chemistry in his final year. His contemporaries remembered him as quite aloof; one of his few close friends was Francis James. In deciding to pursue law as a career, Kerr found a role model in H. V. Evatt, a fellow Fortian who in 1930 became the youngest-ever High Court judge; in the same year, Evatt completed a doctoral thesis on the royal prerogative. Kerr&#x27;s father knew Evatt through his membership of the Labor Party, which Evatt would eventually lead, and had helped him on his successful campaign for the state seat of Balmain in 1925. Evatt became the first in a series of patrons who helped Kerr progress in his career despite a relatively humble background.

==Legal career==
In 1932, Kerr began studying law at the University of Sydney. He again excelled academically, winning a number of prizes, but had little interest in extra-curricular activities. One of his closest friends was Ken Gee, who eventually joined him on the judiciary but was also known for his flirtation with Trotskyism. Kerr eventually graduated in 1936 with first-class honours and the University Medal. He was called to the New South Wales bar in 1938. The same year, Kerr married Alison &quot;Peggy&quot; Worstead, with whom he had three children. He spent World War II working for the Australian intelligence organisation and think tank, the Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. In 1946 he became principal of the Australian School of Pacific Administration and the first Secretary-General of the South Pacific Commission.

Kerr returned to the bar in 1948, becoming a prominent lawyer representing trade union clients and a member of the Labor Party. In the early 1950s he represented Laurie Short in his successful attempts to unseat the leadership of the Federated Ironworkers&#x27; Association of Australia, where he was briefed by future ALP senator Jim McClelland. He intended to seek Labor endorsement for a parliamentary seat at the 1951 election, but withdrew in favour of another candidate. After the Labor Party split of 1955, however, he became disillusioned with party politics. He disliked what he saw as the Labor Party&#x27;s leftward trend under Evatt&#x27;s leadership, but was not attracted to the breakaway group, the Democratic Labor Party. Later in the 1950s, he joined the anti-communist advocacy group established by the United States&#x27; CIA, the Association for Cultural Freedom, joining its executive board in 1957.

In the 1960s Kerr became one of Sydney&#x27;s leading industrial lawyers. In the 1950s he had become a QC. In 1964 he was one of a group of lawyers (which also included future NSW Premier Neville Wran) who lent their expertise to the defence of the publishers of the satirical magazine &quot;Oz&quot; when they were prosecuted for obscenity.

==Judicial career==

In 1966 Kerr was appointed a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and, later, to several other judicial positions. During this period his political views became more conservative. He became a friend of Sir Garfield Barwick, the Liberal attorney-general who became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia in 1964. Kerr was the first chairman of the Law Association for Asia and the Western Pacific (LawAsia), founded by Justice Paul Toose and John Bruce Piggot in 1966. Kerr served as chairman of that organisation until 1970.

Kerr was appointed Chief Justice of New South Wales in 1972. Sir Paul Hasluck was due to retire as Governor-General in July 1974, and the prime minister, Gough Whitlam, needed to find a suitable replacement. His first choice, Ken Myer, declined; he then offered the post to Mr Justice Kerr (as he then was), who accepted on condition that he could expect to have ten years in the office, and that he could represent Australia overseas as head of state. These discussions commenced in September 1973. Kerr was announced as Governor-General-designate on 27 February 1974, by which time he had become Sir John Kerr. He had been knighted in the New Year&#x27;s Honours of 1974, on the advice of the Premier of New South Wales, Sir Robert Askin, after Whitlam had declined to endorse his predecessor Billy McMahon&#x27;s recommendation for that honour, which Hasluck had wisely held back pending the outcome of the December 1972 election. Kerr did not know Whitlam well, although they had shared legal chambers some years earlier, but he had remained friends with several ministers in Whitlam&#x27;s government, such as Jim McClelland and Joe Riordan. Kerr&#x27;s wife Peggy was a fellow student of Margaret Whitlam during university days. Whitlam seems to have believed that, because of Kerr&#x27;s former membership in the Labor Party, he was still politically &quot;reliable&quot;, without realising that Kerr&#x27;s political views had changed and that he had come to see the role of Governor-General differently from Whitlam.

==Governor-General==
The Whitlam government had won a second term in May 1974 following a double dissolution and picked up an additional three Senate seats, leaving it on equal numbers with the Liberal–Country Party coalition and with the balance of power held by two independents. The new parliament was opened by Sir Paul Hasluck on 9 July, and Kerr was sworn in as Governor-General on 11 July. The disputed bills that had led to the double dissolution were reintroduced, and, as expected, were again rejected. The conditions for a joint sitting of the parliament had now been met. On 30 July, Kerr signed a proclamation convening the historic Joint Sitting of the Australian Parliament on 6 and 7 August. All the contested bills were passed.

On 9 September his wife Peggy died after a long illness, aged 59. In April 1975, he married Anne Robson, who had recently divorced her first husband, Hugh Robson QC, a New South Wales judge and former colleague of Kerr&#x27;s. Through her, Kerr acquired two stepchildren.

During 1975 the government was enveloped by a series of ministerial scandals (the &quot;Loans Affair&quot;), which resulted in the sacking of two senior ministers, Rex Connor and Deputy Prime Minister, Jim Cairns. The Liberal Opposition Leader, Malcolm Fraser, decided to use the Senate to block the government&#x27;s budget bills, thus forcing an early election for the House of Representatives (this is called &quot;blocking supply&quot;).

On paper, the Australian Constitution gave the Governor-General wide-ranging powers, including the power to appoint and dismiss ministers and to dissolve Parliament. However, by 1975, the office was viewed as having become almost entirely ceremonial, and it was understood that in most cases the Governor-General was bound to act on the advice of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Whitlam and others held the view that the Governor-General had no discretion in the exercise of these powers; that they must always be exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister and never otherwise. Kerr and others disagreed fundamentally with this view, arguing the Constitution very clearly set out the Governor-General&#x27;s powers.

In addition to the powers normally exercised only on the advice of the Prime Minister, there are certain uncodified reserve powers, exercisable on the Governor-General&#x27;s own initiative. Kerr chose to make a study of the reserve powers through his earlier professional relationship with Evatt, the author of the standard work on the reserve powers as they applied to the British Dominions, &quot;The King and His Dominion Governors&quot; (1936). Kerr was familiar with this book, and re-read it before accepting Whitlam&#x27;s offer of the governor-generalship.

==1975 crisis==

In October 1975 the Liberal–Country Party opposition coalition in the Senate (led by Malcolm Fraser) voted to defer consideration of the supply bills until the Whitlam government agreed to &#x27;submit itself to the Australian people&#x27;, and a political stalemate resulted. With the full support of caucus Whitlam announced that if the Opposition continued to block Supply in the Senate, he would call an early half-Senate election in December. For the next 4 weeks Fraser deferred any vote on these bills. On 6 November Whitlam informed Kerr that, if the Opposition continued to deny a vote on Supply in the Senate, he would call an early half-Senate election the following Tuesday—11 November 1975. The necessary paperwork was then drawn up and drafts exchanged between the Prime Minister&#x27;s office and Government House over the next 4 days. On the morning of 11 November Whitlam rang Kerr and confirmed the wording of the announcement he would make in the House of Representatives that afternoon, setting the half-Senate election in train.

Fraser was also aware of these considerations. He knew that several Liberal senators were uneasy about the blocking of supply, and might not be relied on for much longer—as was indeed confirmed by Liberal Senator Reg Withers after the dismissal. He also saw evidence in the opinion polls that the public was unhappy about the action of the Senate in delaying supply with the Coalition&#x27;s polling dropping 10% in the 4 weeks during which Supply was blocked. For this reason, he was keen to see the crisis brought to an early conclusion. Intervention by the Governor-General was the only clear remedy in the event that supply could not be legislated and the prime minister declined to advise an election.

On 16 October, the Liberal frontbencher, Robert Ellicott (a former Commonwealth Solicitor-General) published with Fraser&#x27;s approval a legal opinion which he had prepared for the Shadow Cabinet, arguing that the Governor-General had both the right and the duty to dismiss the government if it could not obtain supply. Kerr told Whitlam and other government ministers that he considered Ellicott&#x27;s view to be &#x27;bullshit&#x27;. On 17 October, Whitlam told an interviewer that the Governor-General could not intervene in the crisis in view of the convention that he must always act on the advice of his Prime Minister. Whitlam said later that he intended these remarks to protect Kerr, by making clear his view that the Governor-General had no power to intervene.

Kerr saw himself as an active player in the unfolding political drama. He made it clear in several conversations with ministers that he did not accept the view that the Governor-General could play no role in the crisis until supply actually ran out: he saw it as his duty to help prevent things from getting to that stage. On 30 October, he proposed a compromise solution to Whitlam and Fraser which would have, in effect, meant a backdown by Fraser (Kerr proposed that the Opposition allow the supply bills to be passed in return for Whitlam&#x27;s abandoning plans to call an early Senate election), but Fraser did not agree to this. On 2 November, Fraser offered to pass the bills if Whitlam would agree to call an election before the middle of 1976, but Whitlam in turn rejected that solution.

Kerr&#x27;s personal relationship with Whitlam by this stage was not strong, he had been upset by suggestions that the Executive Council had acted improperly during the Loans Affair and, moreover, he was suspicious that if Whitlam knew he was contemplating dismissing the Government, he (Whitlam) would react by pre-emptively advising the Queen to dismiss Kerr instead. Whitlam for his part assumed with characteristic confidence that Kerr would act predictably in the conventional manner of previous vice-regal appointees, was in full sympathy with the Government&#x27;s position, and would do nothing to act against him.

===The dismissal===
Kerr had another meeting with Fraser (with Whitlam&#x27;s approval) on 6 November. At this meeting Fraser increased the pressure on Kerr, advising him that the Opposition would not back down and would not accept any compromise, warning him that, if he did not take action against Whitlam, then the Opposition would begin to make direct public criticism of him for having &quot;failed in his duty&quot;. Fraser urged Kerr to bring about an election before the end of 1975. The provisions of the Electoral Act meant that the last date on which a 1975 election could be announced was 11 November.

On 9 November, Kerr consulted the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Garfield Barwick. Kerr asked Barwick to advise him on whether he had the constitutional power to dismiss Whitlam, and Barwick advised him, in writing, that he did. He also advised him that at least one other High Court justice, Sir Anthony Mason, concurred in this view.

Kerr appears to have made up his mind on 9 November to dismiss Whitlam. He felt it necessary not to disclose this intention to Whitlam and his ministers because of his fear that Whitlam would advise the Queen to exercise her constitutional power to terminate Kerr&#x27;s commission as Governor-General. In so doing, Kerr was aware of the precedent set by Sir Philip Game, the Governor of New South Wales, who had dismissed Jack Lang&#x27;s government in 1932. Game had warned Lang in advance that if he, Lang, did not withdraw certain regulations, then he, Game, would dismiss him. This allowed Lang to seek Game&#x27;s dismissal if he dared, which he did not.

On the morning of Tuesday, 11 November, Whitlam phoned Kerr and arranged to see him at 12:45 pm after the Remembrance Day ceremonies. Kerr also arranged for Fraser to come &quot;a quarter of an hour later. Mr Fraser was not told why I wanted him to come.&quot; Fraser later claimed that Kerr telephoned him and asked him whether, if he were commissioned as Prime Minister, he would: 
* pass the budget bills,
* call an immediate double dissolution election for both houses of Parliament, and
* make no appointments, initiate no new policies, and conduct no inquiries into the previous government, before such an election.

Fraser recalled answering &quot;yes&quot; to all these questions. In his memoirs Kerr denied making such a phone call to Fraser, but Fraser was adamant in all subsequent accounts that he did.

The House of Representatives was suspended at 12:55 pm for the luncheon break. Whitlam arrived at Government House at 1 pm, 15 minutes late. Fraser had arrived earlier and been shown into another room. Whitlam and Kerr met alone in Kerr&#x27;s study. Kerr knew that Whitlam intended to ask for a half-Senate election, one which would need to be conducted without supply. So, after reconfirming that Whitlam&#x27;s intention was to govern without parliamentary supply, Kerr withdrew his commission and served on him the letter of dismissal. Kerr claimed Whitlam then sought to telephone Buckingham Palace to advise Kerr&#x27;s dismissal, but Whitlam has always denied this. At a press conference that afternoon he said &quot;The Governor-General prevented me getting in touch with the Queen by just withdrawing the commission immediately&quot; In an article in &quot;Quadrant&quot; magazine (March 2005, Volume 49, Number 3), David Smith, Kerr&#x27;s Official Secretary, claimed that Whitlam knew of Kerr&#x27;s intentions, the Queen had already made her position of non-intervention known to Whitlam and Kerr, and Kerr had called a double dissolution to be fair to both candidates, sincerely believing that Whitlam could win back government with the necessary majority in both houses.

When Whitlam had left, Kerr summoned Fraser and asked him the same questions which Fraser claims to have answered that morning. When Fraser answered affirmatively, Kerr then commissioned him as Prime Minister.

Kerr later put forward five propositions to justify his actions:

* The Senate had the right under Section 53 of the Constitution to block supply.
* The Government had an obligation to obtain supply through Parliament.
* If the Government could not obtain supply, it had either to resign or call an election.
* If the Government refused to do either of these things, the Governor-General had a right and a duty to act to intervene.
* Since the Prime Minister could at any time advise the Queen to terminate the Governor-General&#x27;s commission, the Governor-General had a right to dismiss the Government without advance warning of his intention to do so.

Kerr later stated that Whitlam represented &quot;something that perhaps I might have been, had I stayed in the party as he did&quot;, and it has been suggested that the Dismissal was &quot;as much a case of a thwarted ego seeking his place in history as Whitlam&#x27;s mismanagement of the economy&quot;. After Kerr&#x27;s death, his former embittered close friend, Whitlam cabinet member James McClelland, claimed that Kerr had long aspired to be &quot;top dog in Australia&quot;; that Kerr had once made a pass at him; and that the Dismissal could only be fully understood if Kerr&#x27;s alleged repressed homosexuality was factored in—that an infatuation with Whitlam had become one for Fraser.

===After the dismissal===
The news that Whitlam had been dismissed spread across Australia during the afternoon, resulting in angry protest demonstrations by his supporters. Over the following month, leading to the double dissolution election scheduled for 13 December 1975, Whitlam and ALP supporters constantly and intensely denigrated Kerr, no doubt in the belief that the electorate would prove sympathetic to the deposed Labor government.
In the ensuing election campaign, the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s focus was predominantly on the asserted illegitimacy of the dismissal (with the slogan of &quot;Shame Fraser, Shame&quot;), while the Coalition focused on criticism of Labor&#x27;s economic management. Some expected a major backlash against Fraser in favour of Whitlam (who had launched his campaign by calling upon his supporters to &quot;maintain your rage&quot;), based on opinion polls in October and early November which had shown disapproval of Fraser&#x27;s tactics. Once the election was called, however, the majority focused on the economy and responded to the Liberals&#x27; slogan &quot;Turn on the lights&quot;. Despite the passion of Labor supporters, furious at what they saw as an establishment plot to destroy a Labor government, Labor suffered its greatest-ever loss (7.4% down on its 1974 vote) at the hands of the Coalition, which continued to hold power until 1983.

Labor supporters continued to voice criticism and demonstrate against Kerr. He found the personal attacks on him and his wife (whom Whitlam and others accused of having been a sinister influence) deeply wounding. For the rest of his term as Governor-General, Kerr was rarely able to appear in public without encountering angry demonstrations. On one occasion his life was thought to be endangered when he was unable to leave a speaking engagement in Melbourne except by having his car drive through an angry crowd. Labor parliamentarians, federal and state, refused to accept his legitimacy as Governor-General, shunning official functions where he was in attendance. Near the end of his term, he famously appeared drunk when he presented the 1977 Melbourne Cup.

===Resignation===
Concern about his health may have been one reason why he cut short his five-year term and stood down in December 1977. In fact, his resignation had already been proposed as early as March 1977, during the Queen&#x27;s visit. Fraser denounced Kerr&#x27;s detractors as &quot;a hostile and bitter minority&quot; whose actions were unjustified. Kerr was appointed to the post of Ambassador to UNESCO, an office which he felt unable to take up because of continuing bitter attacks on him both inside and outside the Parliament. Bill Hayden, the new leader of the Labor Party, now in opposition, was one of the critics of the UNESCO appointment. In the Parliament he stated, &quot;The appointment of John Kerr as Ambassador ... is not just an indecent exercise of the rankest cynicism. It is in every respect an affront to this country.&quot;

Somewhat ironically the post of Ambassador to UNESCO would later be held by Gough Whitlam, the man Kerr dismissed as Prime Minister, when Labor next returned to government in 1983 under Bob Hawke.

==Later life and death==
According to historian Phillip Knightley, &quot;The remaining years of Sir John Kerr&#x27;s life were miserable ones. He was subject to relentless harassment whenever he appeared in public.&quot; He therefore moved to London &quot;where he could be seen most days, usually the worse for wear, at one or other gentleman&#x27;s club.&quot; Jack Waterford observed that, above all, &quot;Sir John&#x27;s legacy was to make the viceroyalty a most controversial post and himself one of the most discussed persons ever to occupy it&quot;.

In 1991, Kerr was confirmed to have died from a brain tumour at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney where he was in a coma, survived by his three children and his second wife. The family withheld announcement of the death until after Sir John&#x27;s burial at Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium, Macquarie Park, New South Wales. This ensured the then Labor government would not be put in the position of deciding whether to offer a state funeral, an honour that would normally be considered automatic for a former governor-general. The second Lady Kerr died in 1997, survived by the two children of her first marriage.

Kerr&#x27;s children are: Gabrielle Kibble, a town planner and later NSW State Director of Planning; Kristin Johnson, a psychiatrist; and Philip Kerr, a solicitor.

==Honours==
Kerr was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on 1 January 1966 for services as President of the Law Council of Australia. This was done on the recommendation of the Australian Government, then led by Sir Robert Menzies.

In 1972, the Prime Minister, William McMahon, had recommended Kerr for a promotion within the order to Knight Commander (KCMG), to be announced in the 1973 New Year&#x27;s Honours. In view of the impending federal election scheduled for 2 December 1972 and the knowledge that the Labor Party&#x27;s longstanding policy was not to support Imperial honours, Governor-General Sir Paul Hasluck chose not to forward such recommendations to the Queen, pending the result of the election. After Gough Whitlam&#x27;s election, Hasluck asked him if he were willing to endorse McMahon&#x27;s recommendation for Kerr&#x27;s knighthood, but he declined. Kerr was appointed KCMG in the New Years Honours of 1974, for services as Chief Justice of NSW, on the recommendation of the UK Foreign Secretary on behalf of the Premier of New South Wales, Sir Robert Askin.

In 1974 he was made a Knight of the Order of St John of Jerusalem.

On the establishment of the Order of Australia on 14 February 1975, as Governor-General he was made Principal Companion of the Order (AC). When the category of Knight was added to the Order on 24 May 1976, he was made Principal Knight of the Order (AK).

In 1976 he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). He had asked Gough Whitlam for this appointment shortly after becoming Governor-General in 1974, but was rebuffed.

On 30 March 1977 he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO), an award within the personal gift of the Sovereign, for services as Governor-General. This award was made by the Queen during an official visit to Australia, and was conferred on board HMY &quot;Britannia&quot; in Fremantle Harbour.

Kerr was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1977 on the instigation of Malcolm Fraser; this was another appointment he had unsuccessfully sought from Whitlam in 1974. In Whitlam&#x27;s book &quot;The Truth of the Matter&quot; he claimed that Fraser also asked the UK Prime Minister, James Callaghan, to grant Kerr a peerage, specifically a viscountcy, but that Callaghan refused.

<text>Glendalough (; ) is a glacial valley in County Wicklow, Ireland, renowned for an Early Medieval monastic settlement founded in the 6th century by St Kevin. From 1825 to 1957, the head of the Glendalough Valley was the site of a galena lead mine. Glendalough is also a recreational area for picnics, for walking along networks of maintained trails of varying difficulty, and also for rock climbing.

==History==

Kevin, a descendant of one of the ruling families in Leinster, studied as a boy under the care of three holy men: Eoghan, Lochan and Eanna. During this time, he went to Glendalough. He was to return later, with a small group of monks to found a monastery where the &#x27;two rivers form a confluence&#x27;. Kevin&#x27;s writings discuss his fighting &quot;knights&quot; at Glendalough; scholars today believe this refers to his process of self-examination and his personal temptations. His fame as a holy man spread and he attracted numerous followers. He died in about 618, traditionally on 3 June. For the next six centuries, Glendalough flourished and the Irish Annals contain references to the deaths of abbots and raids on the settlement.

Circa 1042, oak timber from Glendalough was used to build the second-longest Viking longship recorded (circa 30 m). A modern replica of that ship was built in 2004 and is currently located in Roskilde, Denmark. At the Synod of Rath Breasail in 1111, Glendalough was designated as one of the two dioceses of North Leinster. The Book of Glendalough was written there about 1131. St. Laurence O&#x27;Toole, born in 1128, became Abbot of Glendalough and was well known for his sanctity and hospitality. Even after his appointment as Archbishop of Dublin in 1162, he returned occasionally to Glendalough, to the solitude of St. Kevin&#x27;s Bed. He died in Eu, in Normandy in 1180. In 1176, the Annals of Tigernach report that Glendalough was &#x27;plundered by the foreigners&#x27;. In 1214, the dioceses of Glendalough and Dublin were united. From that time onwards, the cultural and ecclesiastical status of Glendalough diminished. The destruction of the settlement by English forces in 1398 left it a ruin but it continued as a church of local importance and a place of pilgrimage.

Glendalough is on the 1598 map &quot;A Modern Depiction of Ireland, One of the British Isles&quot; by Abraham Ortelius as &quot;Glandalag&quot;. Descriptions of Glendalough from the 18th and 19th centuries include references to occasions of &quot;riotous assembly&quot; on the feast of St. Kevin on 3 June.

The present remains in Glendalough tell only a small part of its story. The monastery in its heyday included workshops, areas for manuscript writing and copying, guest houses, an infirmary, farm buildings and dwellings for both the monks and a large lay population. The buildings which survive probably date from between the 10th and 12th centuries.

==See of Glendalough==

===Church of Ireland succession===
The Church of Ireland maintains the diocese of Glendalough in union with the diocese of Dublin- together being the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough. As such, the Archbishop of Dublin is also styled as bishop of Glendalough.
===Catholic succession===
Since 1969, Glendalough has been a titular see in the Roman Catholic Church
and is used for bishops who hold no ordinary power of their own, and thus are titular bishops.

====Titular bishops====
* Raymond D&#x27;Mello (20 December 1969 – 13 December 1973)

The Gateway to the monastic city of Glendalough is one of the most important monuments, now totally unique in Ireland. It was originally two-storeyed with two fine, granite arches. The antae or projecting walls at each end suggest that it had a timber roof. Inside the gateway, in the west wall, is a cross-inscribed stone. This denoted sanctuary, the boundary of the area of refuge. The paving of the causeway in the monastic city is still preserved in part but very little remains of the enclosure wall.

===Round Tower===

This fine tower, built of mica-slate interspersed with granite is about 30 metres high, with an entrance 3.5 metres from the base. The conical roof was rebuilt in 1876 using the original stones. The tower originally had six timber floors, connected by ladders. The four storeys above entrance level are each lit by a small window; while the top storey has four windows facing the cardinal compass points. Round towers, landmarks for approaching visitors, were built as bell towers, but also served on occasion as store-houses and as places of refuge in times of attack.

===St. Peter and St. Pauls&#x27; Cathedral===

St. Peter and St. Pauls&#x27; Cathedral is the largest and most imposing of the buildings at Glendalough, the cathedral had several phases of construction, the earliest, consisting of the present nave with its antae. The large mica-schist stones which can be seen up to the height of the square-headed west doorway were re-used from an earlier smaller church. The chancel and sacristy date from the late 12th and early 13th centuries. The chancel arch and east window were finely decorated, though many of the stones are now missing. The north doorway to the nave also dates from this period. Under the southern window of the chancel, there is an ambry or wall cupboard and a piscina, a basin used for washing the sacred vessels. A few metres south of the cathedral an early cross of local granite, with an unpierced ring, is commonly known as St. Kevin&#x27;s Cross.
=== Priests&#x27; House ===

Almost totally reconstructed from the original stones, based on a 1779 sketch made by Beranger, the Priests&#x27; House is a small Romanesque building, with a decorative arch at the east end. It gets its name from the practice of interring priests there in the 18th and 19th centuries. Its original purpose is unknown although it may have been used to house relics of St. Kevin.

=== St. Kevin&#x27;s Church or &quot;Kitchen&quot; ===

This stone-roofed building originally had a nave only, with an entrance at the west end and a small round-headed window in the east gable. The upper part of the window can be seen above what became the chancel arch when the chancel (now missing) and the sacristy were added later. The steep roof, formed of overlapping stones, is supported internally by a semi-circular vault. Access to the croft or roof chamber was through a rectangular opening towards the western end of the vault. The church also had a timber first floor. The belfry with its conical cap and four small windows rises from the west end of the stone roof in the form of a miniature round tower. It is commonly known as St. Kevin&#x27;s Kitchen as the bell tower resembles a kitchen chimney. However, food was not cooked here.

=== St. Ciarán&#x27;s Church ===
The remains of this nave-and-chancel church were uncovered in 1875. The church is currently thought to commemorate St. Ciarán, the founder of Clonmacnoise, a monastic settlement that had associations with Glendalough during the 10th century.

=== St. Mary&#x27;s or Our Lady&#x27;s Church ===
One of the earliest and best constructed of the churches, St. Mary&#x27;s or Our Lady&#x27;s Church consists of a nave with a later chancel. Its granite west doorway with an architrave, has inclined jambs and a massive lintel. The underside of the lintel is inscribed with an unusual saltire or x-shaped cross. The east window is round-headed, with a hood moulding and two very worn carved heads on the outside.

===Trinity Church===

A simple nave-and-chancel church, with a fine chancel arch. Trinity Church is beside the main road. A square-headed doorway in the west gable leads into a later annexe, possibly a sacristy. A round tower or belfry was constructed over a vault in this chamber. This fell in a storm in 1818. The doorway inserted in the south wall of the nave also dates from this period. Projecting corbels at the gables would have carried the verge timbers of the roof. It is a simple nave and chancel church with an addition to the west end of the 9 metre long by 5.5 metre wide nave.

===St. Saviour&#x27;s Church===

The most recent of the Glendalough churches, St. Saviour&#x27;s priory was built in the 12th century, probably at the time of St. Laurence O&#x27;Toole. The nave and chancel with their fine decorate stones were restored in the 1870s using stones found on the site. The Romanesque chancel arch has three orders, with highly ornamented capitals. The east window has two round-headed lights. Its decorated features include a serpent, a lion, and two birds holding a human head between their beaks. A staircase in the eastern wall leading from an adjoining domestic building would have given access to a room over the chancel.

===The Deer Stone===

The Deer stone is a bullaun stone. It sits on the south side of the Glenealo River, directly opposite ruins of St Ciarán’s church,
beside the green road leading to the upper lake. Their original use is largely unknown, their original use many of these stones over time developed associations with the saints and were part of the post medieval pilgrim rituals. In August 2023, The Deer Stone was vandalised, causing permanent damage.
== Monuments near the Upper Lough ==

===Reefert Church===
Situated in a grove of trees, this nave-and-chancel church dates from around 1100. Most of the surrounding walls are modern. The name derives from &quot;Righ Fearta&quot;, the burial place of the kings. The church, built in a simple style, has a granite doorway with sloping jambs and flat lintel and a granite chancel arch. The projecting corbels at each gable carried verge timbers for the roof. East of the church there are two crosses of note, one with an elaborate interlace pattern. On the other side of the Poulanass River, close to Reefert are the remains of another small church.

===St. Kevin&#x27;s Cell===
Built on a rocky spur over the lake, this stone structure was 3.6 metres in diameter with walls 0.9 metres thick and a doorway on the east side. Only the foundations survive today and it is possible that the cell had a stone-corbelled roof, similar to the beehive huts on Skellig Michael, County Kerry.

=== St. Kevin&#x27;s Bed ===

St. Kevin&#x27;s Bed is a cave in the rock face about 8 metres above the level of the Upper Lake on its southerly side (with The Spinc cliffs above it). It was reputedly a retreat for St. Kevin and later for St. Laurence O&#x27;Toole. Partly man-made, it runs back 2 metres into the rock. A writer for the &quot;Dublin Penny Journal&quot; described the cave as &quot;not bigger than a small baker&#x27;s oven... I, and two young men who followed me, found it a very tight fit when crouched together in it&quot;.

=== The &quot;Caher&quot; ===

This stone-walled circular enclosure on the level ground between the two lakes is 20 metres in diameter and is of unknown date. Close by, are several crosses, apparently used as stations on the pilgrim&#x27;s route.

===Temple-na-Skellig===

This small rectangular church on the southern shore of the Upper Lake is accessible only by boat, via a series of steps from the landing stage. West of the church is a raised platform with stone enclosure walls, where dwelling huts probably stood. The church, partly rebuilt in the 12th century, has a granite doorway with inclined jambs. At the east gable is an inscribed Latin Cross together with several plain grave slabs and three small crosses.

==Miner&#x27;s Village==

Camaderry Mountain which overlooks the upper Glendalough Lake from the north shore, contains the &quot;Luganure mineral vein&quot; which is a source of lead in the form of galena (PbS), and also contains traces of silver. While the main Camaderry mines were in the neighbouring Glendasan Valley, a second Miner&#x27;s Village and processing facilities were constructed at the head of the Glendalough valley, which was nick-named &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot; by the miners.

In 1859, the Glendasan and Glendalough mines were connected with each other by a series of tunnels called adits, which are now mostly flooded, through the Camaderry mountain. These tunnels helped drain the mineral vein and made it easier to transport ore to Glendalough where it could be more easily processed. The rusted remains of ore crushers can still be seen at the Miner&#x27;s Village, however, the tramway and inclined rails system are gone.

In 1809, Thomas Weaver established the &#x27;Glendalough Mining Company&#x27; in partnership with local investors. Weaver had previously been involved with mapping the geology of Wicklow, after the Wicklow gold rush of 1795, 14 years prior. In 1825, the Glendalough Mining Company took over the Glendasan mines when they bought Weaver&#x27;s shares.

Mining in Glendalough/Glendasan took place in three phases. The first phase was from 1825 to 1890 by the &quot;Mining Company of Ireland&quot;. A second phase took place between 1890 and 1925 by the local Wynne family. The mines were re-opened briefly from 1948 to 1957 after which mining ceased completely.

==Nature==

===Geography===

The valley of Glendalough was formed during the last ice age by a glacier which left a moraine across the valley mouth. The Poulanass River, which plunges into the valley from the south, via the Poulanass Waterfall, created a delta, which eventually divided the original lake in two. Surrounding Glendalough are the mountains of Camaderry , the hydroelectric station at Turlough Hill , and large massif of Conavalla which dominates the head of the valley, and the peaks of Lugduff , and Mullacor .

===Vegetation===
Glendalough is surrounded by semi-natural oak woodland. Much of this was formerly coppiced (cut to the base at regular intervals) to produce wood, charcoal and bark. In the springtime, the oakwood floor is carpeted with a display of bluebells, wood sorrel and wood anemones. Other common plants are woodrush, bracken, polypody fern and various species of mosses. The understorey is largely of holly, hazel and mountain ash.

===Wildlife===
Glendalough is a good place to look for some of Ireland&#x27;s newest breeding species, such as the goosander and the great spotted woodpecker, and some of the rarest, such as the common redstart and the wood warbler; peregrine, white-throated dipper, common cuckoo, eurasian jay and common buzzard can also be seen.
== Recreation ==

===Walking trails===
There are nine way-marked trails of varying difficulty around Glendalough that are maintained by the Wicklow Mountains National Park (and who provide a map of all trails). Some of the trails stay on mostly flat-ground pathways around the two lakes of Glendalough (&quot;The Miner&#x27;s Road Walk&quot;, &quot;Green Road Walk&quot;), others lead up the Poolanass Waterfall area with options beyond into a network of forest paths (e.g. &quot;Derrybawn Woodland Trail&quot;). The most notable trails used to take the steep 600–step boarded path (using railway sleepers), but replaced by a zig-zag path in 2020 from the Poolanass Waterfall up to vantage platform of The Spinc (from the Irish &quot;An Spinc&quot;; meaning &quot;pointed hill&quot;), which overlooks the upper lake and the Glendalough valley below.

The most noted Spinc trail is the &quot;White Route&quot; which follows a further scenic boarded path westwards along the cliffs of the upper lake to the Glenealo Valley (home to herds of red deer), and down on stone paths to the Miner&#x27;s Village, and back along the Miner&#x27;s Road on the north shore of the upper lake, to finish at the upper lake car park, (off the R757). As the entire &quot;White Route&quot; loop is on paths (either stone/sand paths or boarded railway sleepers), it can be completed in running shoes and does not require climbing footwear; the entire 9-kilometre loop of the &quot;White Route&quot;, starting and ending at the upper lake car-park, takes circa 2–3 hours.

The Wicklow Way, a long distance waymarked walking trail, also passes through Glendalough.

The 30-kilometre medieval pilgrimage tail, Saint Kevin&#x27;s Way, starts in Hollywood, and ends in Glendalough.

===Rock climbing===

Glendalough&#x27;s south-facing granite cliffs, situated on slopes of Camaderry above the north-western end of the valley (just above the Miner&#x27;s Village), have been a rock climbing location since 1948. The north-facing cliffs on the other side of the upper lake are not considered suitable for rock-climbing.

The 2009 Mountaineering Ireland climbing guidebook for Wicklow, as well as the online guidebooks for Glendalough, list about 144 routes at all grades up to E5 6b (&quot;Bathsheba&quot; and &quot;The Wake&quot;); the cliffs are particularly noted for their long, and multi-pitch, VS/HVS routes.

The climbs vary between one and four pitches, and up to over 100 metres in length. There are several sectors:
* &quot;Twin Buttress&quot;, lying at the far western end of the cliffs overlooking the Miner&#x27;s Village, is a large buttress divided by a seasonal waterfall (which itself is often split into two streams), with the most popular climbs split over &quot;West Buttress&quot;, &quot;Expectancy Slab&quot; and &quot;Main Face&quot;.
* The &quot;Upper Cliffs&quot;, a band of cliffs high up on the hillside east of Twin Buttress.
* &quot;Acorn Buttress,&quot; a small buttress just below Twin Buttress, which is a popular base-camp location.
* &quot;Hobnail Buttress&quot;, a small buttress with some easy climbing, on the hillside one kilometre to the east.

The Irish Mountaineering Club has operated a climbing hut since the 1950s.

Below the crag is an extensive boulder field which is also used for bouldering activities.

<text>Bologna Football Club 1909, commonly referred to as Bologna (), is an Italian professional football club based in Bologna, Emilia-Romagna that plays in Serie A, the top flight of Italian football. The club have won seven top-flight titles, two Coppa Italia titles, and one UEFA Intertoto Cup.

Founded in 1909, Bologna were founding members of Serie A, and won many of their league championships during the late 1930s. The club ceded any league dominance by 1964, when they won their last league title to date. They won their two Coppa Italia titles in the 1970s, before battling relegation throughout the latter part of the 20th century. Bologna changed ownership multiple times during the early 2000s and 2010s, due to financial mismanagement, and later stabilized under the guise of a Canadian consortium led by Joey Saputo.

Bologna have participated in 75 Serie A seasons, which is the ninth-most in Italian football history. The club have played in the Stadio Renato Dall&#x27;Ara since 1927, which is the tenth-largest stadium by capacity in Serie A.

==History==
Bologna Football Club&#x27;s formation was orchestrated by Emilio Arnstein, an Austrian who became interested in football at university in Vienna and Prague. He and his brother had previously founded another football club, Black Star, in Austria.

The club was founded on 3 October 1909, in the Northern Italian city of Bologna. Upon its formation, Carlo Sandoni was the club&#x27;s sponsor and general manager, Swiss Louis Rauch became president, nobleman Guido Della Valle was the vice-president, Enrico Penaglia secretary, Sergio Lampronti cashier, while Emilio Arnstein and Leone Vincenzi were appointed councilmen.
On 20 March 1910, Bologna played their first ever game, against Virtus, who wore white shirts. Bologna outclassed their opponents, winning 9–1. The first football squad featured; Koch, Chiara, Pessarelli, Bragaglia, Guido Della Valle, Nanni, Donati, Rauch, Bernabeu, Mezzano, and Gradi.

Their formative season was spent in the regional league under Arrigo Gradi as captain, Bologna won their league gaining promotion to a league named &quot;Group Veneto-Emiliano&quot;. They spent four seasons in this league, never finishing lower than fifth. Bologna were entered into the Northern League before all football leagues were postponed for World War I.

===Champions: 1920s and 1930s===
After the first war, Bologna began to become more successful. First reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Italian competition in 1919–20, they went one better the following season by reaching the Northern League finals, going out 2–1 to Pro Vercelli. They would equal this again in 1923–24, coming runner up to eventual national champions Genoa.

Bologna became Northern and National League champions for the first time during 1924–25, beating Genoa CFC after five hard-fought final matches to take the championship. The finals against the Ligurian giants were marred by heavy crowd troubles. A few seasons later Bologna became champions of Italy for the second time in 1928–29 giving them a foothold in Italian football, building up a legacy, this was the last time the league was competed in the old system, Serie A was instated the following year.
Bologna won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; three more times before World War II, in 1935–36, 1936–37 and 1938–39, and once during the war (1940–41).

===Post-World War II===
After World War II, the club was less successful. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the club generally floated between fourth, fifth and sixth position in the league, until they took the league title back in 1963–64. To date this remains their last Serie A championship, bringing the club&#x27;s total to seven. This qualified Bologna to the 1964–65 European Cup (today UEFA Champions League), but they were eliminated in the preliminary round against Anderlecht.
It was not all doom and gloom for the club, however; in the 1970s, they won the Italian Cup twice, the second final of which was against Palermo. The game was tense and finished 1–1 before going to a penalty shootout, where Bologna won 4–3.

===Climbing down and back up the Leagues===
Beginning in the 1981–82 season, the club began to slide. First, they were relegated from Serie A after battling it out for survival with Cagliari and Genoa. They were relegated twice in succession and slid into Serie C1. They won their way out of C1 the next year, and returned to Serie A for the 1988–89 season after four years of fighting it out in Serie B.

They did not remain long, however, being relegated in 1991 and returning to Serie C1 in 1993. The club returned to Serie A for 1996. Two years later, Bologna tasted a slice of success on the European stage, winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup and playing in the UEFA Cup. The club remained in Serie A until the 2004–05 campaign, losing to Parma in the playoffs.

====Serie B====
Despite losing some key players, Bologna expected to be challenging strongly for promotion from Serie B in the 2005–06 campaign. Despite its ambition, however, Bologna had a poor start to the season, causing the sacking of experienced coach Renzo Ulivieri, replaced by former Internazionale defender Andrea Mandorlini.

During this time, the team was sold by Giuseppe Gazzoni Frascara to Alfredo Cazzola, a local entrepreneur. Mandorlini, however, was not either able to bring Bologna up the Serie B table, and was fired on 5 March 2006; Ulivieri was then appointed back as team coach, after having been sacked a few months before. Bologna ended the 2005–06 Serie B campaign in eighth place. In the 2006–07 season, Bologna ended with the seventh place: there were several clashes between chairman Cazzola and head coach Ulivieri, who was ultimately fired on 14 April 2007 and replaced by caretaker and former assistant coach Luca Cecconi. For the 2007–08 season, Bologna was led by Daniele Arrigoni, who helped the &quot;rossoblù&quot; achieve automatic promotion back to the top flight after finishing second in Serie B.

====Serie A====
During the summer of 2008, a club takeover was agreed between Cazzola and an American-based consortium; this was, however, cancelled in the end, following disagreements between the parties, and the club was successively sold to a local group led by new chairman Francesca Menarini, who thus became the second female chairman in the whole Serie A. Arrigoni was confirmed as head coach by the new group, and the start appeared to be particularly impressive, with a surprising 2–1 win at San Siro against Milan thanks to a winning goal scored by Francesco Valiani. The next weeks saw Bologna struggling in the league, however, with eight losses in nine matches. A disappointing 5–1 loss to Cagliari ultimately led the club management to sack Daniele Arrigoni on 3 November 2008 and appoint Siniša Mihajlović as new &quot;rossoblù&quot; boss.

On 14 April 2009, Giuseppe Papadopulo was appointed as the new manager, and successfully managed to raise the team spirit avoiding relegation to Serie B only in the last match of the season. In the 2009–10 season, Bologna played in Serie A for the 65th time, and escaped relegation again despite financial issues under new head coach Franco Colomba.

In June 2010, a club takeover was completed, with the club being sold by the Menarini family to Sardinian entrepreneur Sergio Porcedda. Franco Colomba was sacked right before the 2010–11 season opener on 29 August 2010, despite surviving relegation with the team in the 2009–10 season. The president of the club, Sergio Porcedda, said that the decision was made mostly &quot;because he [Colomba] was skeptical of the team.&quot;

===The consortium &quot;Bologna 2010&quot;===

On 23 December 2010, the consortium &quot;Bologna 2010&quot; led by banker Giovanni Consorte and coffee businessman Massimo Zanetti acquired the club from Sergio Porcedda, after the latter failed to pay wages for the club during his short-tenured ownership and put Bologna in threat of bankruptcy. The company also owed agent fee to Leonardo Corsi in the Andrea Raggi&#x27;s transfer. Zanetti also became the new club chairman, with popular Italian musician and long-time Bologna supporter Gianni Morandi appointed as honorary president.

On 21 January 2011, chairman Massimo Zanetti and CEO Luca Baraldi, after only 28 days, resigned because of irreconcilable differences with the other personal and financial partners.
Stefano Pedrelli became the new director general. For 76 days, the chairman was Marco Pavignani.

From 7 April 2011, after the resignation of Pavignani and having paid €2.5m of capital increase, the new chairman was Albano Guaraldi, the second largest shareholder of the consortium &quot;Bologna 2010&quot; with the 17% of the quotas, behind the outgoing Zanetti.

The 2013–14 season saw Bologna once again relegated to the Serie B, and also gave light to a number of financial problems involving the club and its ownership of Albino Guaraldi, who was considerably criticized by the team supporters also for a number of controversial decisions, including the sale of star player Alessandro Diamanti to Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande. A new head coach was then found in former Cagliari boss Diego López for the new season, whereas Guaraldi clearly stated his intention to hand over his Bologna stakes to a new owner. A North American group headed by Joe Tacopina and Joey Saputo (owner of CF Montréal, also the team of former Bologna hero Marco Di Vaio) then stated its interest in acquiring the club; this was followed by another offer coming from former chairman Massimo Zanetti. On 15 October 2014, the board of directors ratified the sale of the club to BFC 1909 Lux SPV, and Tacopina became the new club chairman.

===The consortium &quot;BFC 1909 Lux Spv&quot;===

Under the new ownership of which BFC 1909 Lux Spv S.A. of Luxemburg is an intermediate holding company, Bologna was promoted back to Serie A in 2015. Saputo also succeeded Tacopina as the new chairman of the board of directors of Bologna on 17 November 2014.

In their first season back in Serie A, Bologna finished 14th avoiding relegation. In the following two seasons, Bologna finished in 15th place on the table. In the 2018–19 Serie A season, Bologna finished in a creditable 10th position on the table. Over the next three seasons, Bologna continued to finish mid table in Serie A coming 12th two campaigns in a row followed by a 13th-placed finish in the 2021–22 season.

On 12 September 2022, Thiago Motta was named as head coach of Bologna. Subsequently, the club concluded in 9th place in the 2022–23 season, accruing 54 points, setting a new record for the team. Under Motta&#x27;s full-season leadership in the following 2023–24 season, the club secured a UEFA Champions League berth for the first time since 1964–65, ensuring a top-five finish in Serie A, and eventually establishing a new record of 68 points.

==Stadium==

The official stadium of Bologna is the Stadio Renato Dall&#x27;Ara. Dall&#x27;Ara is the biggest sports building of Bologna and its name is taken from an ex-chairman of the club, Renato Dall&#x27;Ara, who died three days before the final for Serie A&#x27;s &quot;Scudetto&quot;. Its capacity is 38,500. The &quot;curva Bulgarelli&quot; (in English, Bulgarelli stand), the stand of Bologna&#x27;s ultras, is dedicated to player Giacomo Bulgarelli, who died on 21 February 2009. The other stand, part of which is reserved for the away fans, is dedicated to Árpád Weisz, coach of Bologna&#x27;s winning pre-war team, and killed by the Nazis in a concentration camp during WWII.
