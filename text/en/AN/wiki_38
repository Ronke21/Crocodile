<text>High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a communication protocol used for transmitting data between devices in telecommunication and networking. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), it is defined in the standard ISO/IEC 13239:2002.

HDLC ensures reliable data transfer, allowing one device to understand data sent by another. It can operate with or without a continuous connection between devices, making it versatile for various network configurations.

Originally, HDLC was used in multi-device networks, where one device acted as the master and others as slaves, through modes like Normal Response Mode (NRM) and Asynchronous Response Mode (ARM). These modes are now rarely used. Currently, HDLC is primarily employed in point-to-point connections, such as between routers or network interfaces, using a mode called Asynchronous Balanced Mode (ABM).

==History==
HDLC is based on IBM&#x27;s SDLC protocol, which is the layer 2 protocol for IBM&#x27;s Systems Network Architecture (SNA). It was extended and standardized by the ITU as LAP (Link Access Procedure), while ANSI named their essentially identical version ADCCP.

The HDLC specification does not specify the full semantics of the frame fields. This allows other fully compliant standards to be derived from it, and derivatives have since appeared in innumerable standards. It was adopted into the X.25 protocol stack as LAPB, into the V.42 protocol as LAPM, into the Frame Relay protocol stack as LAPF and into the ISDN protocol stack as LAPD.

The original ISO standards for HDLC are the following:
* ISO 3309-1979 – Frame Structure
* ISO 4335-1979 – Elements of Procedure
* ISO 6159-1980 – Unbalanced Classes of Procedure
* ISO 6256-1981 – Balanced Classes of Procedure

ISO/IEC 13239:2002, the current standard, replaced all of these specifications.

HDLC was the inspiration for the IEEE 802.2 LLC protocol, and it is the basis for the framing mechanism used with the PPP on synchronous lines, as used by many servers to connect to a WAN, most commonly the Internet.

A similar version is used as the control channel for E-carrier (E1) and SONET multichannel telephone lines. Cisco HDLC uses low-level HDLC framing techniques but adds a protocol field to the standard HDLC header.

==Framing==
HDLC frames can be transmitted over synchronous or asynchronous serial communication links. Those links have no mechanism to mark the beginning or end of a frame, so the beginning and end of each frame has to be identified. This is done by using a unique sequence of bits as a frame delimiter, or &quot;flag&quot;, and encoding the data to ensure that the flag sequence is never seen inside a frame. Each frame begins and ends with a frame delimiter. A frame delimiter at the end of a frame may also mark the start of the next frame.

On both synchronous and asynchronous links, the flag sequence is binary &quot;01111110&quot;, or hexadecimal 0x7E, but the details are quite different.

=== Synchronous framing ===
Because a flag sequence consists of six consecutive 1-bits, other data is coded to ensure that it never contains more than five 1-bits in a row. This is done by bit stuffing: any time that five consecutive 1-bits appear in the transmitted data, the data is paused and a 0-bit is transmitted.

The receiving device knows that this is being done, and after seeing five 1-bits in a row, a following 0-bit is stripped out of the received data. If instead the sixth bit is 1, this is either a flag (if the seventh bit is 0), or an error (if the seventh bit is 1). In the latter case, the frame receive procedure is aborted, to be restarted when a flag is next seen.

This bit-stuffing serves a second purpose, that of ensuring a sufficient number of signal transitions. On synchronous links, the data is NRZI encoded, so that a 0-bit is transmitted as a change in the signal on the line, and a 1-bit is sent as no change. Thus, each 0 bit provides an opportunity for a receiving modem to synchronize its clock via a phase-locked loop. If there are too many 1-bits in a row, the receiver can lose count. Bit-stuffing provides a minimum of one transition per six bit times during transmission of data, and one transition per seven bit times during transmission of a flag.

When no frames are being transmitted on a simplex or full-duplex synchronous link, a frame delimiter is continuously transmitted on the link. This generates one of two continuous waveforms, depending on the initial state:

The HDLC specification allows the 0-bit at the end of a frame delimiter to be shared with the start of the next frame delimiter, i.e. &quot;011111101111110&quot;. Some hardware does not support this.

For half-duplex or multi-drop communication, where several transmitters share a line, a receiver on the line will see continuous idling 1-bits in the inter-frame period when no transmitter is active.

HDLC transmits bytes of data with the least significant bit first (not to be confused with little-endian order, which refers to byte ordering within a multi-byte field).

=== Asynchronous framing ===
When using asynchronous serial communication such as standard RS-232 serial ports, synchronous-style bit stuffing is inappropriate for several reasons:
* Bit stuffing is not needed to ensure an adequate number of transitions, as start and stop bits provide that,
* Because the data is NRZ encoded for transmission, rather than NRZI encoded, the encoded waveform is different,
* RS-232 sends bits in groups of 8, making adding single bits very awkward, and
* For the same reason, it is only necessary to specially code flag &quot;bytes&quot;; it is not necessary to worry about the bit pattern straddling multiple bytes.
Instead asynchronous framing uses &quot;control-octet transparency&quot;, also called &quot;byte stuffing&quot; or &quot;octet stuffing&quot;. The frame boundary octet is 01111110, (0x7E in hexadecimal notation). A &quot;control escape octet&quot;, has the value 0x7D (bit sequence &#x27;10111110&#x27;, as RS-232 transmits least-significant bit first). If either of these two octets appears in the transmitted data, an escape octet is sent, followed by the original data octet with bit 5 inverted. For example, the byte 0x7E would be transmitted as 0x7D 0x5E (&quot;10111110 01111010&quot;). Other reserved octet values (such as XON or XOFF) can be escaped in the same way if necessary.

The &quot;abort sequence&quot; 0x7D 0x7E ends a packet with an incomplete byte-stuff sequence, forcing the receiver to detect an error. This can be used to abort packet transmission with no chance the partial packet will be interpreted as valid by the receiver.

==Structure==
The contents of an HDLC frame are shown in the following table:

Note that the end flag of one frame may be (but does not have to be) the beginning (start) flag of the next frame.

Data is usually sent in multiples of 8 bits, but only some variants require this; others theoretically permit data alignments on other than 8-bit boundaries.

The frame check sequence (FCS) is a 16-bit CRC-CCITT or a 32-bit CRC-32 computed over the Address, Control, and Information fields. It provides a means by which the receiver can detect errors that may have been induced during the transmission of the frame, such as lost bits, flipped bits, and extraneous bits. However, given that the algorithms used to calculate the FCS are such that the probability of certain types of transmission errors going undetected increases with the length of the data being checked for errors, the FCS can implicitly limit the practical size of the frame.

If the receiver&#x27;s calculation of the FCS does not match that of the sender&#x27;s, indicating that the frame contains errors, the receiver can either send a negative acknowledge packet to the sender, or send nothing. After either receiving a negative acknowledge packet or timing out waiting for a positive acknowledge packet, the sender can retransmit the failed frame.

The FCS was implemented because many early communication links had a relatively high bit error rate, and the FCS could readily be computed by simple, fast circuitry or software. More effective forward error correction schemes are now widely used by other protocols.

== Types of stations (computers) and data transfer modes ==
Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) was originally designed to connect one computer with multiple peripherals via a multidrop bus. The original &quot;normal response mode&quot; is a primary-secondary mode where the computer (or primary terminal) gives each peripheral (secondary terminal) permission to speak in turn. Because all communication is either to or from the primary terminal, frames include only one address, that of the secondary terminal; the primary terminal is not assigned an address. There is a distinction between commands sent by the primary to a secondary, and responses sent by a secondary to the primary, but this is not reflected in the encoding; commands and responses are indistinguishable except for the difference in the direction in which they are transmitted.

Normal response mode allows the secondary-to-primary link to be shared without contention, because it has the primary give the secondaries permission to transmit one at a time. It also allows operation over half-duplex communication links, as long as the primary is aware that it may not transmit when it has permitted a secondary to do so.

Asynchronous response mode is an HDLC addition for use over full-duplex links. While retaining the primary/secondary distinction, it allows the secondary to transmit at any time. Thus, there must be some other mechanism to ensure that multiple secondaries do not try to transmit at the same time (or only one secondary).

Asynchronous balanced mode adds the concept of a &quot;combined terminal&quot; which can act as both a primary and a secondary. Unfortunately, this mode of operation has some implementation subtleties. While the most common frames sent do not care whether they are in a command or response frame, some essential ones do (notably most unnumbered frames, and any frame with the P/F bit set), and the address field of a received frame must be examined to determine whether it contains a command (the address received is ours) or a response (the address received is that of the other terminal).

This means that the address field is not optional, even on point-to-point links where it is not needed to disambiguate the peer being talked to. Some HDLC variants extend the address field to include both source and destination addresses, or an explicit command/response bit.

== HDLC operations and frame types ==
Three fundamental types of HDLC frames may be distinguished:
* Information frames, or I-frames, transport user data from the network layer. They can also include flow and error control information piggybacked on data.
* Supervisory frames, or S-frames, are used for flow and error control whenever piggybacking is impossible or inappropriate, such as when a station does not have data to send. S-frames do not have information fields.
* Unnumbered frames, or U-frames, are used for various miscellaneous purposes, including link management. Some U-frames contain an information field, depending on the type.

=== Control field ===
The general format of the control field is:

There are also extended (two-byte) forms of I and S frames. Again, the least significant bit (rightmost in this table) is sent first.

=== P/F bit ===
Poll/Final is a single bit with two names. It is called Poll when part of a command (set by the primary station to obtain a response from a secondary station), and Final when part of a response (set by the secondary station to indicate a response or the end of transmission). In all other cases, the bit is clear.

The bit is used as a token that is passed back and forth between the stations. Only one token should exist at a time. The secondary only sends a Final when it has received a Poll from the primary. The primary only sends a Poll when it has received a Final back from the secondary, or after a timeout indicating that the bit has been lost.
* In NRM, possession of the poll token also grants the addressed secondary permission to transmit. The secondary sets the F-bit in its last response frame to give up permission to transmit. (It is equivalent to the word &quot;Over&quot; in radio voice procedure.)
* In ARM and ABM, the P bit forces a response. In these modes, the secondary need not wait for a poll to transmit, so the final bit may be included in the &quot;first&quot; response after the poll.
* If no response is received to a P bit in a reasonable period of time, the primary station times out and sends P again.
* The P/F bit is at the heart of the basic checkpoint retransmission scheme that is required to implement HDLC; all other variants (such as the REJ S-frame) are optional and only serve to increase efficiency. Whenever a station receives a P/F bit, it may assume that any frames that it sent before it last transmitted the P/F bit and not yet acknowledged will never arrive, and so should be retransmitted.

When operating as a combined station, it is important to maintain the distinction between P and F bits, because there may be two checkpoint cycles operating simultaneously. A P bit arriving in a command from the remote station is not in response to our P bit; only an F bit arriving in a response is.

===N(R), the receive sequence number===
Both I and S frames contain a receive sequence number N(R). N(R) provides a positive acknowledgement for the receipt of I-frames from the other side of the link. Its value is always the first frame not yet received; it acknowledges that all frames with N(S) values up to N(R)−1 (modulo 8 or modulo 128) have been received and indicates the N(S) of the next frame it expects to receive.

N(R) operates the same way whether it is part of a command or response. A combined station only has one sequence number space.

=== N(S), the sequence number of the sent frame ===
This is incremented for successive I-frames, modulo 8 or modulo 128. Depending on the number of bits in the sequence number, up to 7 or 127 I-frames may be awaiting acknowledgment at any time.

===I-Frames (user data)===
Information frames, or I-frames, transport user data from the network layer. In addition they also include flow and error control information piggybacked on data. The sub-fields in the control field define these functions.

The least significant bit (first transmitted) defines the frame type. 0 means an I-frame.
Except for the interpretation of the P/F field, there is no difference between a command I frame and a response I frame; when P/F is 0, the two forms are exactly equivalent.

===S-frames (control)===
Supervisory Frames, or &#x27;S-frames&#x27;, are used for flow and error control whenever piggybacking is impossible or inappropriate, such as when a station does not have data to send. S-frames in HDLC do not have information fields, although some HDLC-derived protocols use information fields for &quot;multi-selective reject&quot;.

The S-frame control field includes a leading &quot;10&quot; indicating that it is an S-frame. This is followed by a 2-bit type, a poll/final bit, and a 3-bit sequence number. (Or a 4-bit padding field followed by a 7-bit sequence number.)

The first (least significant) 2 bits mean it is an S-frame. All S frames include a P/F bit and a receive sequence number as described above. Except for the interpretation of the P/F field, there is no difference between a command S frame and a response S frame; when P/F is 0, the two forms are exactly equivalent.

====Receive Ready (RR)====
* Bit value = 00 (0x00 to match above table type field bit order)
* Indicate that the sender is ready to receive more data (cancels the effect of a previous RNR).
* Send this packet if you need to send a packet but have no I frame to send.
* A primary station can send this with the P-bit set to solicit data from a secondary station.
* A secondary terminal can use this with the F-bit set to respond to a poll if it has no data to send.

====Receive Not Ready (RNR)====
* Bit value = 01 (0x04 to match above table type field bit order)
* Acknowledge some packets but request no more be sent until further notice.
* Can be used like RR with P bit set to solicit the status of a secondary station
* Can be used like RR with F bit set to respond to a poll if the station is busy.

====Reject (REJ)====
* Bit value = 10 (0x08 to match above table type field bit order)
* Requests immediate retransmission starting with N(R).
* Sent in response to an observed sequence number gap; e.g. after seeing I1/I2/I3/I5, send REJ4.
* Optional to generate; a working implementation may use only RR.

====Selective Reject (SREJ)====
* Bit value = 11 (0x0c to match above table type field bit order)
* Requests retransmission of only the frame N(R).
* Not supported by all HDLC variants.
* Optional to generate; a working implementation may use only RR, or only RR and REJ.

===U-Frames===
Unnumbered frames, or U-frames, are primarily used for link management, although a few are used to transfer user data. They exchange session management and control information between connected devices, and some U-frames contain an information field, used for system management information or user data.
The first 2 bits (11) mean it is a U-frame. The five type bits (2 before P/F bit and 3 bit after P/F bit) can create 32 different types of U-frame. In a few cases, the same encoding is used for different things as a command and a response.

====Mode setting====
The various modes are described in . Briefly, there are two non-operational modes (initialization mode and disconnected mode) and three operational modes (normal response, asynchronous response, and asynchronous balanced modes) with 3-bit or 7-bit (extended) sequence numbers.

; Disconnected mode (DM) response
: When the secondary is disconnected (the default state on power-up), it sends this generic response to any poll (command frame with the poll flag set) except an acceptable mode setting command. It may alternatively give a FRMR response to an unacceptable mode set command.
; Unnumbered acknowledge (UA) response
: This is the secondary&#x27;s response to an acceptable mode set command, indicating that it is now in the requested mode.
; Set ... mode (SNRM, SARM, SABM) command
: Place the secondary in the specified mode, with 3-bit sequence numbers (1-byte control field). The secondary acknowledges with UA. If the secondary does not implement the mode, it responds with DM or FRMR.
; Set ... mode extended (SNRME, SARME, SABME) command
: Place the secondary in the specified mode, with 7-bit sequence numbers (2-byte control field).
; Set mode (SM) command
: Generic mode set, new in ISO/IEC 13239, using an information field to select parameters. ISO/IEC 13239 added many additional options to HDLC, including 15- and 31-bit sequence numbers, which can only be selected with this command.
; Disconnect (DISC) command
: This command causes the secondary to acknowledge with UA and disconnect (enter disconnected mode). Any unacknowledged frames are lost.
; Request disconnect (RD) response
: This response requests the primary to send a DISC command. The primary should do so promptly, but may delay long enough to ensure all pending frames are acknowledged.
; Set initialization mode (SIM) command
: This rarely-implemented command is used to perform some secondary-specific initialization, such as downloading firmware. What happens in initialization mode is not otherwise specified in the HDLC standard.
; Request initialization mode (RIM) response
: This requests the primary to send SIM and initialize the secondary. It sent in lieu of DM if the secondary requires initialization.

====Information transfer====
These frames may be used as part of normal information transfer.

; Unnumbered information (UI)
: This frame (command or response) communicates user data, but without acknowledgement or retransmission in case of error.
; UI with header check (UIH)
: This frame (command or response), a ISO/IEC 13239 addition and rarely used, is like UI but also excludes CRC protection. Only a configurable-length prefix (&quot;header&quot;) of the frame is covered by the CRC polynomial; errors in the rest of the frame are not detected.
; Unnumbered poll (UP) command
: This command solicits a response from the secondary. With the poll bit set, it acts like any other poll frame, without the acknowledgement that must be included in I or S frame. With the poll bit clear, it has a special meaning in normal response mode: the secondary &quot;may&quot; respond, even though it has not received the poll bit. This is rarely used in HDLC, but was used in the original IBM SDLC as a substitute for the lack of asynchronous response mode; where the communication channel could handle simultaneous responses, the primary would periodically send UP to the broadcast address to collect any pending responses.

====Error Recovery====
; Frame reject (FRMR) response
: The FRMR response contains a description of the unacceptable frame, in a standardized format. The first 1 or 2 bytes are a copy of the rejected control field, the next 1 or 2 contain the secondary&#x27;s current send and receive sequence numbers (and a flag indicating that the frame was a response, applicable only in balanced mode), and the following 4 or 5 bits are error flags indicating the reason for the rejection. The secondary repeats the same FRMR response to every poll until the error is cleared by a mode set command or RSET. The error flags are:
:* W: the frame type (control field) is not understood or not implemented.
:* X: the frame type is not understood with a non-empty information field, but one was present.
:* Y: the frame included an information field that is larger than the secondary can accept.
:* Z: the frame included an invalid receive sequence number N(R), one which is not between the previously received value and the highest sequence number transmitted. (This error cannot be cleared by receiving RSET, but can be cleared by &quot;sending&quot; RSET.)
:* V: the frame included an invalid send sequence number N(S), greater than the last number acknowledged plus the transmit window size. This error is only possible if a transmit window size smaller than the maximum has been negotiated.
:* The error flags are normally padded with 0 bits to an 8-bit boundary, but HDLC permits frames which are not a multiple of a byte long.
; Reset (RSET) command
: The RSET command causes a secondary to reset its receive sequence number so the next expected frame is sequence number 0. This is a possible alternative to sending a new mode set command, which resets both sequence numbers. It is acknowledged with UA, like a mode set command.

====Peer discovery====
; Exchange identification (XID)
: An XID command includes an information field specifying the primary&#x27;s capabilities; the secondary responds with an XID response specifying its capabilities. This is normally done before sending a mode set command. Systems Network Architecture defined one format for the information field, in which the most significant bit of the first byte is clear (0), but HDLC implementations normally implement the variant defined in ISO 8885, which has the most significant bit of the first byte set (1).
; TEST
: A TEST command is simply a ping command for debugging purposes. The payload of the TEST command is returned in the TEST response.

====Defined in other standards====

There are several U frames which are not part of HDLC, but defined in other related standards.

; Nonreserved (NR0, NR1, NR2, NR3)
: The &quot;nonreserved&quot; commands and responses are guaranteed by the HDLC standard to be available for other uses.
; Ack connectionless (AC0, AC1)
: These are defined in the IEEE 802.2 logical link control standard.
; Configure (CFGR)
: This command was defined in SDLC for debugging. It had a 1-byte payload which specified a non-standard test mode for the secondary. Even numbers disabled the mode, while odd numbers enabled it. A payload of 0 disabled all test modes. The secondary normally acknowledged a configure command by echoing it in response.
; Beacon (BCN) response
: This response was defined in SDLC to indicate a communications failure. A secondary which received no frames at all for a long time would begin sending a stream of beacon responses, allowing a unidirectional fault to be located. Note that ISO/IEC 13239 assigns UIH the same encoding as BCN.

==Link configurations==

Link configurations can be categorized as being either:
* &quot;Unbalanced&quot;, which consists of one primary terminal, and one or more secondary terminals.
* &quot;Balanced&quot;, which consists of two peer terminals.

The three link configurations are:
* &quot;Normal Response Mode&quot; (NRM) is an unbalanced configuration in which only the primary terminal may initiate data transfer. The secondary terminals transmit data only in response to commands from the primary terminal. The primary terminal polls each secondary terminal to give it an opportunity to transmit any data it has.
* &quot;Asynchronous Response Mode&quot; (ARM) is an unbalanced configuration in which secondary terminals may transmit without permission from the primary terminal. However, there is still a distinguished primary terminal which retains responsibility for line initialization, error recovery, and logical disconnect.
* &quot;Asynchronous Balanced Mode&quot; (ABM) is a balanced configuration in which either station may initialize, supervise, recover from errors, and send frames at any time. There is no master/slave relationship. The DTE (data terminal equipment) and DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment) are treated as equals. The initiator for Asynchronous Balanced Mode sends an SABM.

An additional link configuration is &quot;Disconnected mode&quot;. This is the mode that a secondary station is in before it is initialized by the primary, or when it is explicitly disconnected. In this mode, the secondary responds to almost every frame other than a mode set command with a &quot;Disconnected mode&quot; response. The purpose of this mode is to allow the primary to reliably detect a secondary being powered off or otherwise reset.

==HDLC Command and response repertoire==
The minimal set required for operation are:
* Commands: I, RR, RNR, DISC, and one of SNRM, SARM or SABM
* Responses: I, RR, RNR, UA, DM, FRMR

===Basic operations===
* Initialization can be requested by either side. When the primary sends one of the six mode-set commands, it:
** Signals the other side that initialization is requested
** Specifies the mode, NRM, ABM, ARM
** Specifies whether 3 or 7 bit sequence numbers are in use.
The HDLC module on the other end transmits (UA) frame when the request is accepted. If the request is rejected it sends (DM) disconnect mode frame.

===Functional extensions (options)===
* For Switched Circuits
** Commands: ADD – XID
** Responses: ADD – XID, RD
* For 2-way Simultaneous commands &amp; responses are ADD – REJ
* For Single Frame Retransmission commands &amp; responses: ADD – SREJ
* For Information Commands &amp; Responses: ADD – Ul
* For Initialization
** Commands: ADD – SIM
** Responses: ADD – RIM
* For Group Polling
** Commands: ADD – UP
* Extended Addressing
* Delete Response I Frames
* Delete Command I Frames
* Extended Numbering
* For Mode Reset (ABM only) Commands are: ADD – RSET
* Data Link Test Commands &amp; Responses are: ADD – TEST
* Request Disconnect. Responses are ADD – RD
* 32-bit FCS

== HDLC command and response repertoire ==
===Unnumbered frames===
Unnumbered frames are identified by the low two bits being 1. With the P/F flag, that leaves 5 bits as a frame type. Even though fewer than 32 values are in use, some types have different meanings depending on the direction they are sent: as a command or as a response. The relationship between the DISC (disconnect) command and the RD (request disconnect) response seems clear enough, but the reason for making SARM command numerically equal to the DM response is obscure.


: * ISO/IEC 13239 addition
: † Not part of HDLC

The UI, UIH, XID, TEST frames contain a payload, and can be used as both commands and responses. The SM command and FRMR response also contain a payload.
* A UI frame contains user information, but unlike an I frame it is neither acknowledged nor retransmitted if lost.
* A UIH frame (an ISO/IEC 13239 addition) is like a UI frame, but additionally applies the frame check sequence only to a specified-length prefix of the frame; transmission errors after this prefix are not detected.
* The XID frame is used to exchange terminal capabilities. Systems Network Architecture defined one format, but the variant defined in ISO 8885 is more commonly used. A primary advertises its capabilities with an XID command, and a secondary returns its own capabilities in an XID response.
* The TEST frame is simply a ping command for debugging purposes. The payload of the TEST command is returned in the TEST response.
* The SM command (an ISO/IEC 13239 addition) is a generic &quot;set mode&quot; command which includes an information field (in the same ISO 8885 format as XID) specifying parameters. This allows parameter values (like 15- and 31-bit sequence numbers) and parameters like window sizes and maximum frame sizes not expressible by the standard six mode-set commands to be negotiated.
* The FRMR response contains a description of the unacceptable frame, in a standardized format. The first 1 or 2 bytes are a copy of the rejected control field, the next 1 or 2 contain the secondary&#x27;s current send and receive sequence numbers, and the following 4 or 5 bits are error flags indicating the reason for the rejection.

<text>Sir George Ivan &quot;Van&quot; Morrison (born 31 August 1945) is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter and musician whose recording career started in the 1960s. Morrison&#x27;s albums have performed well in the UK and Ireland, with more than 40 reaching the UK top 40, as well as internationally, including in Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. 

He has scored top ten albums in the UK in four consecutive decades, following the success of 2021&#x27;s &quot;Latest Record Project, Volume 1&quot;. Eighteen of his albums have reached the top 40 in the United States, twelve of them between 1997 and 2017. Since turning 70 in 2015, he has released – on average – more than an album a year. His accolades include two Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the 2017 Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting, and inductions into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2016 he was knighted for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland.

Morrison began performing as a teenager in the late 1950s, playing a variety of instruments including guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for various Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. Known as &quot;Van the Man&quot; to his fans, Morrison rose to prominence in the mid-1960s as the lead singer of the Belfast R&amp;B band Them, with whom he wrote and recorded &quot;Gloria&quot;, which became a garage band staple. His solo career started under the pop-hit-oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; in 1967.

After Berns&#x27;s death, Warner Bros. Records bought Morrison&#x27;s contract and allowed him three sessions to record &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; (1968). While initially a poor seller, the album has come to be regarded as a classic. &quot;Moondance&quot; (1970) established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances.

Much of Morrison&#x27;s music is structured around the conventions of soul music and early rhythm and blues. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream of consciousness narrative, of which &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; is a prime example. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as &quot;Celtic soul&quot;, and his music has been described as attaining &quot;a kind of violent transcendence&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life and musical roots: 1945–1964===
George Ivan Morrison was born on 31 August 1945, at 125 Hyndford Street, Bloomfield, Belfast, Northern Ireland, as the only child of George Morrison, a shipyard electrician, and Violet Morrison (née Stitt), who had been a singer and tap dancer in her youth. The previous occupant of the house was the writer Lee Child&#x27;s father. Morrison&#x27;s family were working class Protestants descended from the Ulster Scots population that settled in Belfast. From 1950 to 1956, Morrison, who began to be known as &quot;Van&quot; during this time, attended Elmgrove Primary School. His father had what was at the time one of the largest record collections in Northern Ireland (acquired during his time in Detroit, Michigan, in the early 1950s) and the young Morrison grew up listening to artists such as Jelly Roll Morton, Ray Charles, Lead Belly, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Solomon Burke; of whom he later said, &quot;If it weren&#x27;t for guys like Ray and Solomon, I wouldn&#x27;t be where I am today. Those guys were the inspiration that got me going. If it wasn&#x27;t for that kind of music, I couldn&#x27;t do what I&#x27;m doing now.&quot;

His father&#x27;s record collection exposed him to various musical genres, such as the blues of Muddy Waters; the gospel of Mahalia Jackson; the jazz of Charlie Parker; the folk music of Woody Guthrie; and country music from Hank Williams and Jimmie Rodgers, while the first record he ever bought was by blues musician Sonny Terry. When Lonnie Donegan had a hit with &quot;Rock Island Line&quot;, written by Huddie Ledbetter (Lead Belly), Morrison felt he was familiar with and able to connect with skiffle music as he had been hearing Lead Belly before that.

Morrison&#x27;s father bought him his first acoustic guitar when he was 11, and he learned to play rudimentary chords from the song book &quot;The Carter Family Style&quot;, edited by Alan Lomax. In 1957, at the age of twelve, Morrison formed his first band, a skiffle group, &quot;The Sputniks&quot;, named after the satellite, Sputnik 1, that had been launched in October of that year by the Soviet Union. In 1958, the band played at some of the local cinemas, and Morrison took the lead, contributing most of the singing and arranging. Other short-lived groups followed – at 14, he formed Midnight Special, another modified skiffle band, and played at a school concert. Then, when he heard Jimmy Giuffre playing saxophone on &quot;The Train and The River&quot;, he talked his father into buying him a tenor saxophone, and took saxophone and music reading lessons from jazz musician George Cassidy, who Morrison saw as a &quot;big inspiration&quot;, and they became friends, he also grew up with him on Hyndford Street. Now playing the saxophone, Morrison joined with various local bands, including one called Deanie Sands and the Javelins, with whom he played guitar and shared singing. The line-up of the band was lead vocalist Deanie Sands, guitarist George Jones, and drummer and vocalist Roy Kane. Later the four main musicians of the Javelins, with the addition of Wesley Black as pianist, became known as the Monarchs.

Morrison attended Orangefield Boys Secondary School, leaving in July 1960 with no qualifications. As a member of a working-class community, he was expected to get a regular full-time job, so after several short apprenticeship positions, he settled into a job as a window cleaner—later alluded to in his songs &quot;Cleaning Windows&quot; and &quot;Saint Dominic&#x27;s Preview&quot;. However, he had been developing his musical interests from an early age and continued playing with the Monarchs part-time. Young Morrison also played with the Harry Mack Showband, the Great Eight, with his older workplace friend, Geordie (G. D.) Sproule, whom he later named as one of his biggest influences.

At age 17, Morrison toured Europe for the first time with the Monarchs, now calling themselves the International Monarchs. This Irish showband, with Morrison playing saxophone, guitar and harmonica, in addition to back-up duty on bass and drums, toured seamy clubs and US Army bases in Scotland, England and Germany, often playing five sets a night. While in Germany, the band recorded a single, &quot;Boozoo Hully Gully&quot;/&quot;Twingy Baby&quot;, under the name Georgie and the Monarchs. This was Morrison&#x27;s first recording, taking place in November 1963 at Ariola Studios in Cologne with Morrison on saxophone; it made the lower reaches of the German charts.

Upon returning to Belfast in November 1963, the group disbanded, so Morrison connected with Geordie Sproule again and played with him in the Manhattan Showband along with guitarist Herbie Armstrong. When Armstrong auditioned to play with Brian Rossi and the Golden Eagles, later known as the Wheels, Morrison went along and was hired as a blues singer.

===Them: 1964–1966===

The roots of Them, the band that first broke Morrison on the international scene, came in April 1964 when he responded to an advert for musicians to play at a new R&amp;B club at the Maritime Hotel in College Square North – an old Belfast hostel frequented by sailors. The new club needed a band for its opening night. Morrison had left the Golden Eagles (the group with which he had been performing at the time), so he created a new band out of the Gamblers, an East Belfast group formed by Ronnie Millings, Billy Harrison and Alan Henderson in 1962. Eric Wrixon, still a schoolboy, was the piano player and keyboardist. Morrison played saxophone and harmonica and shared vocals with Billy Harrison. They followed Eric Wrixon&#x27;s suggestion for a new name, and the Gamblers morphed into Them, their name taken from the horror movie &quot;Them!&quot;

The band&#x27;s R&amp;B performances at the Maritime attracted attention. Them performed without a routine and Morrison ad libbed, creating his songs live as he performed. While the band did covers, they also played some of Morrison&#x27;s early songs, such as &quot;Could You Would You&quot;, which he had written in Camden Town while touring with the Manhattan Showband. The debut of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Gloria&quot; took place on stage here. Sometimes, depending on his mood, the song could last up to twenty minutes. Morrison has said, &quot;Them lived and died on the stage at the Maritime Hotel&quot;, believing the band did not manage to capture the spontaneity and energy of their live performances on their records. The statement also reflected the instability of the Them line-up, with numerous members passing through the ranks after the definitive Maritime period. Morrison and Henderson remained the only constants, and a less successful version of Them soldiered on after Morrison&#x27;s departure.

Dick Rowe of Decca Records became aware of the band&#x27;s performances and signed Them to a standard two-year contract. In that period, they released two albums and ten singles, with two more singles released after Morrison departed the band. They had three chart hits, &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; (1964), &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot; (1965), and &quot;Mystic Eyes&quot; (1965), but it was the B-side of &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, the garage band classic &quot;Gloria&quot;, that went on to become a rock standard covered by Patti Smith, the Doors, the Shadows of Knight, Jimi Hendrix and many others.
Building on the success of their singles in the United States, and riding on the back of the British Invasion, Them undertook a two-month tour of America in May and June 1966 that included a residency from 30 May to 18 June at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. The Doors were the supporting act on the last week, and Morrison&#x27;s influence on the Doors singer Jim Morrison was noted by John Densmore in his book &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;. Brian Hinton relates how &quot;Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near namesake&#x27;s stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum during instrumental breaks.&quot; On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on &quot;Gloria&quot;.

Toward the end of the tour the band members became involved in a dispute with their manager, Decca Records&#x27; Phil Solomon, over the revenues paid to them; that, coupled with the expiry of their work visas, meant the band returned from America dejected. After two more concerts in Ireland, Them split up. Morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated to America.

===Start of solo career with Bang Records and &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;: 1967===

Bert Berns, Them&#x27;s producer and composer of their 1965 hit &quot;Here Comes the Night&quot;, persuaded Morrison to return to New York to record solo for his new label, Bang Records. Morrison flew over and signed a contract he had not fully studied. During a two-day recording session at A &amp; R Studios starting 28 March 1967, he recorded eight songs, originally intended to be used as four singles. Instead, these songs were released as the album &quot;Blowin&#x27; Your Mind!&quot; without Morrison&#x27;s consultation. He said he only became aware of the album&#x27;s release when a friend mentioned that he had bought a copy. Morrison was unhappy with the album and said he &quot;had a different concept of it&quot;.

&quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, one of the songs from &quot;Blowin&#x27; Your Mind!&quot;, was released as a single in mid-June 1967, reaching number ten in the US charts. &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; became Morrison&#x27;s most-played song. The song spent a total of sixteen weeks on the chart. An evaluation in 2015 of downloads since 2004 and airplay since 2010 had &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; as the most popular song of the entire 1960s decade. In 2000, it was listed at No. 21 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;/MTV list of 100 Greatest Pop Songs and as No. 49 on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Rock Songs. In 2010, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; was ranked No. 110 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine list of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In January 2007, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Following the death of Berns in 1967, Morrison became involved in a contract dispute with Berns&#x27; widow, Ilene Berns, that prevented him from performing on stage or recording in the New York area. The song &quot;Big Time Operators&quot;, released in 1993, is thought to allude to his dealings with the New York music business during this period. He moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and faced personal and financial problems; he had &quot;slipped into a malaise&quot; and had trouble finding concert bookings. He regained his professional footing through the few gigs he could find, and started recording with Warner Bros. Records.

Warner Bros. bought out Morrison&#x27;s Bang contract with a $20,000 cash transaction that took place in an abandoned warehouse on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan. A clause required Morrison to submit 36 original songs within a year to Berns&#x27; music publishing company. He recorded them in one session on an out-of-tune guitar, with lyrics about subjects including ringworm and sandwiches. Ilene Berns thought the songs were &quot;nonsense&quot; and did not use them. The throwaway compositions came to be known as the &quot;revenge&quot; songs, and did not see official release until the 2017 compilation &quot;The Authorized Bang Collection&quot;.

===&quot;Astral Weeks&quot;: 1968===
Morrison&#x27;s first album for Warner Bros Records was &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; (which he had already performed in several clubs around Boston), a mystical song cycle, often considered to be his best work and one of the best albums of all time. Morrison has said, &quot;When &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; came out, I was starving, &quot;literally&quot;.&quot; Released in 1968, the album originally received an indifferent response from the public, but it eventually achieved critical acclaim.

The album is described by AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann as hypnotic, meditative, and as possessing a unique musical power. It has been compared to French Impressionism and mystical Celtic poetry. A 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine review begins with the words: &quot;This is music of such enigmatic beauty that thirty-five years after its release, &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; still defies easy, admiring description.&quot; Alan Light later described &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; as &quot;like nothing he had done previously—and really, nothing anyone had done previously. Morrison sings of lost love, death, and nostalgia for childhood in the Celtic soul that would become his signature.&quot; It has been placed on many lists of best albums of all time. In the 1995 &quot;Mojo&quot; list of 100 Best Albums, it was listed as number two and was number nineteen on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2003. In December 2009, it was voted the top Irish album of all time by a poll of leading Irish musicians conducted by &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine.

===&quot;Moondance&quot; to &quot;Into the Music&quot;: 1970–1979===

Morrison&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Moondance&quot;, which was released in 1970, became his first million selling album and reached number twenty-nine on the Billboard charts. The style of &quot;Moondance&quot; stood in contrast to that of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. Whereas &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; had a sorrowful and vulnerable tone, &quot;Moondance&quot; restored a more optimistic and cheerful message to his music, which abandoned the previous record&#x27;s abstract folk compositions in favour of more formally composed songs and a lively rhythm and blues style he expanded on throughout his career.

The title track, although not released in the US as a single until 1977, received heavy play in FM radio formats. &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; has also gained a wide following over the years. &quot;Come Running&quot;, which reached the American Top 40, rescued Morrison from what seemed then as Hot 100 obscurity. &quot;Moondance&quot; was both well received and favourably reviewed. Lester Bangs and Greil Marcus had a combined full-page review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying Morrison now had &quot;the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word.&quot; &quot;That was the type of band I dig,&quot; Morrison said of the &quot;Moondance&quot; sessions. &quot;Two horns and a rhythm section—they&#x27;re the type of bands that I like best.&quot; He produced the album himself as he felt like nobody else knew what he wanted. &quot;Moondance&quot; was listed at number sixty-five on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. In March 2007, &quot;Moondance&quot; was listed as number seventy-two on the NARM Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the &quot;Definitive 200&quot;.

Over the next few years, he released a succession of albums, starting with a second one in 1970. &quot;His Band and the Street Choir&quot; had a freer, more relaxed sound than &quot;Moondance&quot;, but not the &quot;perfection&quot;, in the opinion of critic Jon Landau, who felt like &quot;a few more numbers with a gravity of &#x27;Street Choir&#x27; would have made this album as perfect as anyone could have stood.&quot; It contained the hit single &quot;Domino&quot;, which charted at number nine in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1971, he released another well-received album, &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;. This album produced the hit single &quot;Wild Night&quot; that was later covered by John Mellencamp and Meshell Ndegeocello. The title song has a notably country-soul feel about it and the album ended with another country tune, &quot;Moonshine Whiskey&quot;. Morrison said he originally intended to make an all-country album. The recordings were as live as possible—after rehearsing the songs the musicians would enter the studio and play a whole set in one take. His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the &quot;scariest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen. When he&#x27;s got something together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing.&quot;

Released in 1972, &quot;Saint Dominic&#x27;s Preview&quot; revealed Morrison&#x27;s break from the more accessible style of his previous three albums and moving back towards the more daring, adventurous, and meditative aspects of &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. The combination of two styles of music demonstrated a versatility not previously found in his earlier albums. Two songs, &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&#x27;m in Heaven When You Smile)&quot; and &quot;Redwood Tree&quot;, reached the Hot 100 singles chart. The songs &quot;Listen to the Lion&quot; and &quot;Almost Independence Day&quot; are each over ten minutes long and employ the type of poetic imagery not heard since &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;. It was his highest-charting album in the US until his Top Ten debut on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2008.

He released his next album, &quot;Hard Nose the Highway&quot;, in 1973, receiving mixed, but mostly negative, reviews. The album contained the popular song &quot;Warm Love&quot; but otherwise has been largely dismissed critically. In a 1973 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, it was described as: &quot;psychologically complex, musically somewhat uneven and lyrically excellent.&quot;

During a three-week vacation visit to Ireland in October 1973, Morrison wrote seven of the songs that made up his next album, &quot;Veedon Fleece&quot;. Though it attracted scant initial attention, its critical stature grew markedly over the years—with &quot;Veedon Fleece&quot; now often considered to be one of Morrison&#x27;s most impressive and poetic works. In a 2008 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Andy Greene writes that when released in late 1974: &quot;it was greeted by a collective shrug by the rock critical establishment&quot; and concludes: &quot;He&#x27;s released many wonderful albums since, but he&#x27;s never again hit the majestic heights of this one.&quot; &quot;You Don&#x27;t Pull No Punches, but You Don&#x27;t Push the River&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s side closers, exemplifies the long, hypnotic, cryptic Morrison with its references to visionary poet William Blake and to the seemingly Grail-like Veedon Fleece object.

Morrison took three years to release a follow-up album. After a decade without taking time off, he said in an interview, he needed to get away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer&#x27;s block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title &quot;Mechanical Bliss&quot;, or &quot;Naked in the Jungle&quot;, or &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, came to nothing, and Morrison&#x27;s next album was &quot;A Period of Transition&quot; in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song-making.

&quot;Into the Music&quot;: The album&#x27;s last four songs, &quot;Angelou&quot;, &quot;And the Healing Has Begun&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Game/You Know What They&#x27;re Writing About&quot; are a veritable tour-de-force with Morrison summoning every vocal trick at his disposal from Angelou&#x27;s climactic shouts to the sexually-charged, half-mumbled monologue in &quot;And the Healing Has Begun&quot; to the barely audible whisper that is the album&#x27;s final sound.
--Scott Thomas Review

The following year, Morrison released &quot;Wavelength&quot;; it became at that time the fastest-selling album of his career and soon went gold. The title track became a modest hit, peaking at number forty-two. Making use of 1970s synthesisers, it mimics the sounds of the shortwave radio stations he listened to in his youth. The opening track, &quot;Kingdom Hall&quot;—the name given by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses to their places of worship—evoked Morrison&#x27;s childhood experiences of religion with his mother, and foretold the religious themes that were more evident on his next album, &quot;Into the Music&quot;.

Considered by AllMusic as &quot;the definitive post-classic-era Morrison&quot;, &quot;Into the Music&quot; was released in the last year of the 1970s. Songs on this album for the first time alluded to the healing power of music, which became an abiding interest of Morrison&#x27;s. &quot;Bright Side of the Road&quot; was a joyful, uplifting song that is featured on the soundtrack of the movie, &quot;Michael&quot;.

===&quot;Common One&quot; to &quot;Avalon Sunset&quot;: 1980–1989===
With his next album, the new decade found Morrison following his muse into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews. In February 1980, Morrison and a group of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later &quot;Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product.&quot; The album, &quot;Common One&quot;, consisted of six songs; the longest, &quot;Summertime in England&quot;, lasted fifteen and a half minutes and ended with the words &quot;Can you feel the silence?&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; magazine&#x27;s Paul Du Noyer called the album &quot;colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak.&quot; Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s Van acting the part of the &#x27;mystic poet&#x27; he thinks he&#x27;s supposed to be.&quot; Morrison insisted the album was never &quot;meant to be a commercial album.&quot; Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: &quot;He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality.&quot; Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of &quot;Summertime in England&quot;. Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, &quot;Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made our usual mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics.&quot;

Morrison&#x27;s next album, &quot;Beautiful Vision&quot;, released in 1982, had him returning once again to the music of his Northern Irish roots. Well received by the critics and public, it produced a minor UK hit single, &quot;Cleaning Windows&quot;, that referenced one of Morrison&#x27;s first jobs after leaving school. Several other songs on the album, &quot;Vanlose Stairway&quot;, &quot;She Gives Me Religion&quot;, and the instrumental, &quot;Scandinavia&quot; show the presence of a new personal muse in his life: a Danish public relations agent, who would share Morrison&#x27;s spiritual interests and serve as a steadying influence on him throughout most of the 1980s. &quot;Scandinavia&quot;, with Morrison on piano, was nominated in the &quot;Best Rock Instrumental Performance&quot; category for the 25th Annual Grammy Awards.

Much of the music Morrison released throughout the 1980s continued to focus on the themes of spirituality and faith. His 1983 album, &quot;Inarticulate Speech of the Heart&quot;, was &quot;a move towards creating music for meditation&quot; with synthesisers, uilleann pipes and flute sounds, and four of the tracks were instrumentals. The titling of the album and the presence of the instrumentals were noted to be indicative of Morrison&#x27;s long-held belief that &quot;it&#x27;s not the words one uses but the force of conviction behind those words that matters.&quot; During this period of time, Morrison had studied Scientology and gave &quot;Special Thanks&quot; to L. Ron Hubbard on the album&#x27;s credits.

&quot;A Sense of Wonder&quot;, Morrison&#x27;s 1985 album, pulled together the spiritual themes contained in his last four albums, which were defined in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review as: &quot;rebirth (&quot;Into the Music&quot;), deep contemplation and meditation (&quot;Common One&quot;); ecstasy and humility (&quot;Beautiful Vision&quot;); and blissful, mantra like languor (&quot;Inarticulate Speech of the Heart&quot;).&quot; The single &quot;Tore Down a la Rimbaud&quot; was a reference to Rimbaud and an earlier bout of writer&#x27;s block that Morrison had encountered in 1974. In 1985, Morrison also wrote the musical score for the movie &quot;Lamb&quot; starring Liam Neeson.

Morrison&#x27;s 1986 release, &quot;No Guru, No Method, No Teacher&quot;, was said to contain a &quot;genuine holiness ... and musical freshness that needs to be set in context to understand.&quot; Critical response was favourable with a &quot;Sounds&quot; reviewer calling the album &quot;his most intriguingly involved since &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;&quot; and &quot;Morrison at his most mystical, magical best.&quot; It contains the song &quot;In the Garden&quot; that, according to Morrison, had a &quot;definite meditation process which is a &#x27;form&#x27; of transcendental meditation as its basis. It&#x27;s not TM&quot;. He entitled the album as a rebuttal to media attempts to place him in various creeds. In an interview in the Observer he told Anthony Denselow:

After releasing the &quot;No Guru&quot; album, Morrison&#x27;s music appeared less gritty and more adult contemporary with the well-received 1987 album, &quot;Poetic Champions Compose&quot;, considered to be one of his recording highlights of the 1980s. The romantic ballad from this album, &quot;Someone Like You&quot;, has been featured subsequently in the soundtracks of several movies, including 1995&#x27;s &quot;French Kiss&quot;, and in 2001, both &quot;Someone Like You&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;.

In 1988, he released &quot;Irish Heartbeat&quot;, a collection of traditional Irish folk songs recorded with the Irish group the Chieftains, which reached number 18 in the UK album charts. The title song, &quot;Irish Heartbeat&quot;, was originally recorded on his 1983 album &quot;Inarticulate Speech of the Heart&quot;.

The 1989 album, &quot;Avalon Sunset&quot;, which featured the hit duet with Cliff Richard &quot;Whenever God Shines His Light&quot; and the ballad &quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot; (on which &quot;earthly love transmutes into that for God&quot; (Hinton)), reached 13 on the UK album chart. Although considered to be a deeply spiritual album, it also contained &quot;Daring Night&quot;, which &quot;deals with full, blazing sex, whatever its churchy organ and gentle lilt suggest&quot;(Hinton). Morrison&#x27;s familiar themes of &quot;God, woman, his childhood in Belfast and those enchanted moments when time stands still&quot; were prominent in the songs. He can be heard calling out the change of tempo at the end of this song, repeating the numbers &quot;1–4&quot; to cue the chord changes (the first and fourth chord in the key of the music). He often completed albums in two days, frequently releasing first takes.

===&quot;The Best of Van Morrison&quot; to &quot;Back on Top&quot;: 1990–1999===
The early to middle 1990s were commercially successful for Morrison with three albums reaching the top five of the UK charts, sold-out concerts, and a more visible public profile; but this period also marked a decline in the critical reception to his work. The decade began with the release of &quot;The Best of Van Morrison&quot;; compiled by Morrison himself, the album was focused on his hit singles, and became a multi-platinum success remaining a year and a half on the UK charts. AllMusic determined it to be &quot;far and away the best-selling album of his career.&quot; In 1991 he wrote and produced four songs for Tom Jones released on the &quot;Carrying A Torch&quot; album and performed a duet with Bob Dylan on BBC Arena special.

The 1994 live double album &quot;A Night in San Francisco&quot; received favourable reviews as well as commercial success by reaching number eight on the UK charts. 1995&#x27;s &quot;Days Like This&quot; also had large sales—though the critical reviews were not always favourable. This period also saw a number of side projects, including the live jazz performances of 1996&#x27;s &quot;How Long Has This Been Going On&quot;, from the same year &quot;Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison&quot;, and 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998&quot;, all of which found Morrison paying tribute to his early musical influences.

In 1997, Morrison released &quot;The Healing Game&quot;. The album received mixed reviews, with the lyrics being described as &quot;tired&quot; and &quot;dull&quot;, though critic Greil Marcus praised the musical complexity of the album by saying: &quot;It carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete he or she might have forgotten that music could call up such a place, and then populate it with people, acts, wishes, fears.&quot; The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. His next release, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Back on Top&quot;, achieved modest success, being his highest-charting album in the US since 1978&#x27;s &quot;Wavelength&quot;.

===&quot;Down the Road&quot; to &quot;Keep It Simple&quot;: 2000–2009===
Van Morrison continued to record and tour in the 2000s, often performing two or three times a week. He formed his own independent label, Exile Productions Ltd, which enables him to maintain full production control of each album he records, which he then delivers as a finished product to the recording label that he chooses, for marketing and distribution.

In 2001, nine months into a tour with Linda Gail Lewis promoting their collaboration &quot;You Win Again&quot;, Lewis left the tour, later filing claims against Morrison for unfair dismissal and sexual discrimination. Both claims were later withdrawn, and Morrison&#x27;s solicitor said, &quot;(Mr Morrison&#x27;s) pleased that these claims have finally been withdrawn. He accepted a full apology and comprehensive retraction which represents a complete vindication of his stance from the outset. Miss Lewis has given a full and categorical apology and retraction to Mr Morrison.&quot; Lewis&#x27; legal representative Christine Thompson said both parties had agreed to the terms of the settlement.

The album &quot;Down the Road&quot;, released in May 2002, received a good critical reception and proved to be his highest-charting album in the US since 1972&#x27;s &quot;Saint Dominic&#x27;s Preview&quot;. It had a nostalgic tone, with its fifteen tracks representing the various musical genres Morrison had previously covered—including R&amp;B, blues, country and folk; one of the tracks was written as a tribute to his late father George, who had played a pivotal role in nurturing his early musical tastes.

Morrison&#x27;s 2005 album, &quot;Magic Time&quot;, debuted at number twenty-five on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts upon its May release, some forty years after Morrison first entered the public&#x27;s eye as the frontman of Them. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as number seventeen on &quot;The Top 50 Records of 2005&quot;. Also in July 2005, Morrison was named by Amazon as one of their top twenty-five all-time best-selling artists and inducted into the Amazon.com Hall of Fame. Later in the year, Morrison also donated a previously unreleased studio track to a charity album, &quot;Hurricane Relief: Come Together Now&quot;, which raised money for relief efforts intended for Gulf Coast victims devastated by hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Morrison composed the song, &quot;Blue and Green&quot;, featuring Foggy Lyttle on guitar. This song was released in 2007 on the album, &quot;The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3&quot; and also as a single in the UK. Van Morrison was a headline act at the international Celtic music festival, The Hebridean Celtic Festival in Stornoway, Outer Hebrides in the summer of 2005.

He released an album with a country music theme, entitled &quot;Pay the Devil&quot;, on 7 March 2006 and appeared at the Ryman Auditorium, where the tickets sold out immediately after they went on sale. &quot;Pay the Devil&quot; debuted at number twenty-six on the Billboard 200 and peaked at number seven on Top Country Albums. Amazon Best of 2006 Editor&#x27;s Picks in Country listed the country album at number ten in December 2006. Still promoting the country album, Morrison&#x27;s performance as the headline act on the first night of the Austin City Limits Music Festival on 15 September 2006 was reviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as one of the top ten shows of the 2006 festival. In November 2006, a limited edition album, &quot;Live at Austin City Limits Festival&quot;, was issued by Exile Productions, Ltd. A later deluxe CD/DVD release of &quot;Pay the Devil&quot;, in the summer of 2006, contained tracks from the Ryman performance. In October 2006, Morrison had released his first commercial DVD, &quot;Live at Montreux 1980/1974&quot;, with concerts taken from two separate appearances at the Montreux Jazz Festival.

A new double CD compilation album, &quot;The Best of Van Morrison Volume 3&quot;, was released in June 2007 containing thirty-one tracks, some of which were previously unreleased. Morrison selected the tracks, which ranged from the 1993 album &quot;Too Long in Exile&quot; to the song &quot;Stranded&quot; from the 2005 album &quot;Magic Time&quot;. On 3 September 2007, Morrison&#x27;s complete catalogue of albums from 1971 through 2002 were made available exclusively at the iTunes Store in Europe and Australia and during the first week of October 2007, the albums became available at the US iTunes Store.

&quot;Still on Top – The Greatest Hits&quot;, a thirty-seven-track double CD compilation album, was released on 22 October 2007 in the UK on the Polydor label. On 29 October 2007, the album charted at number two on the Official UK Top 75 Albums—his highest UK charting. The November release in the US and Canada contains twenty-one selected tracks. The hits released on albums with the copyrights owned by Morrison as Exile Productions Ltd.—1971 and later—had been remastered in 2007.

&quot;Keep It Simple&quot;, Morrison&#x27;s 33rd studio album of completely new material, was released by Exile/Polydor Records on 17 March 2008 in the UK and released by Exile/Lost Highway Records in the US and Canada on 1 April 2008. It comprised eleven self-penned tracks. Morrison promoted the album with a short US tour including an appearance at the SXSW music conference, and a UK concert broadcast on BBC Radio 2. In the first week of release &quot;Keep It Simple&quot; debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number ten, Morrison&#x27;s first Top Ten charting in the US.

===&quot;Born to Sing&quot; to &quot;Three Chords&quot;: 2010–2020===
Morrison released two albums in the first half of the decade, followed by a further six in just five years, his productivity increasing noticeably as he turned 70. &quot;Born to Sing: No Plan B&quot; was released on 2 October 2012 on Blue Note Records. The album was recorded in Belfast, Morrison&#x27;s birthplace and hometown. The first single from this album, &quot;Open the Door (To Your Heart)&quot;, was released on 24 August 2012. A selection of Morrison&#x27;s lyrics, &quot;Lit Up Inside&quot;, was published by City Lights Books in the US and Faber &amp; Faber in the UK. The book was released on 2 October 2014 and an evening of words and music commenced at the Lyric Theatre, London on 17 November 2014 to mark its launch. Morrison himself selected his best and most iconic lyrics from a catalog of 50 years of writing.

In 2015, Morrison sold the rights to most of his catalogue to Legacy Recordings, the catalog division of Sony Music. This resulted in 33 of his albums being made available as digital releases and through all streaming services for the first time that August. His first album recorded with Sony under the new contract was &quot;&quot;, released on 24 March 2015 on the subsidiary, RCA Records. Morrison&#x27;s 70th birthday in 2015 was marked by celebrations in his hometown of Belfast, commencing with BBC Radio Ulster presenting programs including &quot;Top 70 Van Tracks&quot; between 26 and 28 August. As the headline act ending the Eastside Arts Festival, Morrison performed two 70th-birthday concerts on Cyprus Avenue on his birthday 31 August. The first of the concerts was broadcast live on BBC Radio Ulster and a 60-minute BBC film of highlights from the concerts, entitled &quot;Up On Cyprus Avenue&quot;, was first shown on 4 September. The following year, on 30 September, Morrison released &quot;Keep Me Singing&quot;, his 36th studio album. &quot;Too Late&quot;, the first single, was released on the same day. The songs are twelve originals and one cover and the album represents his first release of originals since &quot;Born to Sing: No Plan B&quot; in 2012. A short tour of the U.S. followed with six dates in October 2016, followed by a short tour of the U.K. with eight dates in October—December 2016, including a London show at &quot;The O2 Arena&quot; on 30 October. The U.S. tour resumed in January 2017 with five new dates in Las Vegas and Clearwater, Florida.

Morrison&#x27;s album &quot;Roll with the Punches&quot; was released on 22 September 2017. That July, he and Universal Music Group were sued by former professional wrestler Billy Two Rivers for using his likeness on its cover and promotional material without his permission. On 4 August, Two Rivers&#x27; lawyer said the parties had reached a preliminary agreement to settle the matter out of court. He released his 38th studio album, &quot;Versatile&quot;, on 1 December 2017. It features covers of nine classic jazz standards and seven original songs including his arrangement of the traditional &quot;Skye Boat Song&quot;. He quickly followed up with his 39th studio album, &quot;You&#x27;re Driving Me Crazy&quot;, released on 27 April 2018 via Sony Legacy Recordings. The album features a collaboration with Joey DeFrancesco on a mixture of blues and jazz classics that include eight Morrison originals from his back catalogue.

In October 2018, Morrison announced that his 40th studio album, &quot;The Prophet Speaks&quot;, would be released by Caroline International on 7 December 2018. A year later, in November 2019, he released his 41st studio album, &quot;Three Chords &amp; the Truth&quot;. On 5 March 2020 Faber and Faber published &quot;Keep &#x27;Er Lit&quot;, the second volume of Van Morrison&#x27;s selected lyrics. It features a foreword of fellow poet Paul Muldoon and comprehends 120 songs from across his career. In November 2020 Morrison and Eric Clapton collaborated on a single called &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, whose profits from sales will be donated to Morrison&#x27;s Lockdown Financial Hardship Fund.

===Coronavirus controversy===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Morrison made numerous statements against social distancing measures that affected live music events, and made calls to &quot;fight pseudo-science&quot;. Continuing with this narrative, Morrison released three new songs in September 2020, which had messages of protest against COVID-19 lockdowns in the UK. Morrison accused the UK government of &quot;taking our freedom&quot;. He had performed socially distanced concerts previously, but said that the shows were not a sign of &quot;compliance&quot;.

There were calls in Belfast for Belfast City Council to revoke his Freedom of the City honour following the statements: city councillor Emmet McDonough-Brown said that his lyrics were &quot;undermining the guidance in place to protect lives and are ignorant of established science as we grapple with Covid-19.&quot; Northern Ireland health minister Robin Swann accused Morrison of smearing public health practitioners and called Morrison&#x27;s anti-lockdown songs &quot;dangerous&quot;. In November 2021, Swann sued Morrison for defamation, after he said that Swann was a &quot;fraud&quot; and &quot;very dangerous&quot;. In 2022, Morrison issued legal proceedings against Swann over an opinion piece in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that was critical of Morrison&#x27;s anti-lockdown songs and actions. Both legal claims were settled confidentially shortly before their respective court proceedings were to begin in September 2024.

===2020s===
In March 2021, Morrison announced that his 42nd album, &quot;Latest Record Project, Volume 1&quot;, would be released by Exile Productions and BMG on 7 May. The 28-track album includes songs such as &quot;Why Are You on Facebook?&quot;, &quot;They Own The Media&quot; and &quot;Western Man&quot;. In addition to digitally, it was released as a 2-CD set and on triple vinyl. The album marked a return to the UK Top Ten for Morrison, making the 2020s the fourth consecutive decade in which he has achieved such success.

The following year, &quot;What&#x27;s It Gonna Take?&quot; explored many of the same themes, but was less successful commercially. In 2023, he returned to his roots with &quot;Moving on Skiffle&quot; and &quot;Accentuate the Positive&quot;. He also issued archival material via his own direct-to-consumer label Orangefield Records, beginning with &quot;Beyond Words: Instrumental&quot; and continuing in 2024 with &quot;Live at Orangefield&quot;, taken from a run of 2014 concerts at his former secondary school. His 2024 studio album &quot;New Arrangements and Duets&quot; also compiled unreleased material, including big band reworkings of songs from his catalogue and duets with Kurt Elling, Curtis Stigers, Joss Stone and Willie Nelson recorded between 2014 and 2019. 

Van Morrison&#x27;s songs were used extensively in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s Oscar-winning 2021 film &quot;Belfast&quot;: Morrison received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Down to Joy&quot;. Several tracks were also featured in &quot;Cherry&quot;, released the same year. &quot;Down to Joy&quot; would not be released on a Van Morrison album until 2025, when it became the lead single from &quot;Remembering Now&quot;, his first album of original material since 2022.

==Live performances==
===1970s===

By 1972, after being a performer for nearly ten years, Morrison began experiencing stage fright when performing for audiences of thousands, as opposed to the hundreds he had experienced in his early career. He became anxious on stage and had difficulty establishing eye contact with the audience. He once said in an interview about performing on stage, &quot;I dig singing the songs but there are times when it&#x27;s pretty agonising for me to be out there.&quot; After a brief break from music, he started appearing in clubs, regaining his ability to perform live, albeit with smaller audiences.

The 1974 live double album &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late to Stop Now&quot; has been called one of the greatest recordings of a live concert and has appeared on lists of greatest live albums of all time. Biographer Johnny Rogan wrote, &quot;Morrison was in the midst of what was arguably his greatest phase as a performer.&quot; Performances on the album were from tapes made during a three-month tour of the US and Europe in 1973 with the backing group the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. Soon after recording the album, Morrison restructured the Caledonia Soul Orchestra into a smaller unit, the Caledonia Soul Express.
On Thanksgiving Day 1976, Morrison performed at the farewell concert for the Band. It was his first live performance in several years, and he considered skipping his appearance until the last minute, even refusing to go on stage when they announced his name. His manager, Harvey Goldsmith, said he &quot;literally kicked him out there.&quot; Morrison was on good terms with the members of the Band as near-neighbours in Woodstock, and they had the shared experience of stage fright. At the concert, he performed two songs. His first was a rendition of the classic Irish song &quot;Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral&quot;. His second song was &quot;Caravan&quot;, from his 1970 album &quot;Moondance&quot;. Greil Marcus, in attendance at the concert, wrote: &quot;Van Morrison turned the show around ... singing to the rafters and ... burning holes in the floor. It was a triumph, and as the song ended Van began to kick his leg into the air out of sheer exuberance and he kicked his way right offstage like a Rockette. The crowd had given him a fine welcome and they cheered wildly when he left.&quot; The filmed concert served as the basis for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1978 film, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;.

During his association with the Band, Morrison acquired the nicknames &quot;Belfast Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Van the Man&quot;. On the Band&#x27;s album &quot;Cahoots&quot;, as part of the duet &quot;4% Pantomime&quot; that Morrison sings with Richard Manuel (and that he co-wrote with Robbie Robertson), Manuel addresses him, &quot;Oh, Belfast Cowboy&quot;. When he leaves the stage after performing &quot;Caravan&quot; on &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, Robertson calls out &quot;Van the Man!&quot;

===1990s===
On 21 July 1990, Morrison joined many other guests for Roger Waters&#x27; massive performance of &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot;. He sang &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; with Roger Waters and several members from The Band: Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko. At the concert&#x27;s end, he and the other performers sang &quot;The Tide Is Turning&quot;. The live audience was estimated at between three hundred thousand and half a million people, and it was broadcast live on television as well.

Morrison performed before an estimated audience of sixty to eighty thousand people when US President Bill Clinton visited Belfast, Northern Ireland on 30 November 1995. His song &quot;Days Like This&quot; had become the official anthem for the Northern Irish peace movement.

===2000s and live albums===
Van Morrison continued performing concerts throughout the year, rather than touring. Playing few of his best-known songs in concert, he has firmly resisted relegation to a nostalgia act. During a 2006 interview, he told Paul Sexton:

On 7 and 8 November 2008, at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, Morrison performed the entire &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; album live for the first time. The &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; band featured guitarist Jay Berliner, who had played on the album that was released forty years previously in November 1968. Also featured on piano was Roger Kellaway. A live album entitled &quot;Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; resulted from these two performances. The new live album on CD was released on 24 February 2009, followed by a DVD from the performances. The DVD, &quot;Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl: The Concert Film&quot; was released via Amazon Exclusive on 19 May 2009.

In February and March 2009, Morrison returned to the US for &quot;Astral Weeks Live&quot; concerts, interviews and TV appearances with concerts at Madison Square Garden and at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. He was interviewed by Don Imus on his &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; radio show and put in guest appearances on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. Morrison continued with the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; performances with two concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London in April and then returned to California in May 2009 performing the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; songs at the Hearst Greek Theatre in Berkeley, the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, California and appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Morrison filmed the concerts at the Orpheum Theatre so they could be viewed by Farrah Fawcett, confined to bed with cancer and thus unable to attend the concerts.

In addition to &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late to Stop Now&quot; and &quot;Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;, Morrison has released three other live albums: &quot;Live at the Grand Opera House Belfast&quot; in 1984; &quot;A Night in San Francisco&quot; in 1994 that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine felt stood out as: &quot;the culmination of a career&#x27;s worth of soul searching that finds Morrison&#x27;s eyes turned toward heaven and his feet planted firmly on the ground&quot;; and &quot;The Skiffle Sessions – Live in Belfast 1998&quot; recorded with Lonnie Donegan and Chris Barber and released in 2000.
Morrison was scheduled to perform at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 25th anniversary concert on 30 October 2009, but cancelled. In an interview on 26 October, Morrison told his host, Don Imus, he had planned to play &quot;a couple of songs&quot; with Eric Clapton (who had cancelled on 22 October due to gallstone surgery), and they would do something else together at &quot;some other stage of the game&quot;.

===2010s to present===
Morrison performed for the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada on 4 August 2010 as the headline act for the fundraiser and was scheduled as second-day headliner at the Feis 2011 Festival in London&#x27;s Finsbury Park on 19 June 2011. He appeared in concert at Odyssey Arena in Belfast on 3 February and at the O2 in Dublin on 4 February 2012. He appeared at the 46th Montreux Jazz Festival as a headliner on 7 July 2012.

In 2014, Morrison&#x27;s former high school Orangefield High School, formerly known as Orangefield Boys&#x27; Secondary School closed its doors permanently. To mark the school&#x27;s closure Morrison performed in the school assembly hall for three nights of concerts from 22 to 24 August. The performance on 22 August was exclusively for former teachers and pupils and the two remaining concerts were for members of the public The first night of the Nocturne Live concerts at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, UK on 25 June 2015, featured Morrison and Grammy Award-winning American Jazz vocalist and songwriter Gregory Porter.

In June 2021, The Times noted that &quot;fittingly for someone who has been so vocally opposed to the lockdown&quot; resulting from the 2020–2021 coronavirus pandemic, &quot;Van Morrison played one of the first big-scale concerts in London since events, albeit tentatively, started up again.&quot; Will Hodgkinson wrote that the show &quot;was as good an argument for the return of live music as you could wish for.&quot;

==Collaborations==
Van Morrison has collaborated extensively with a variety of artists throughout his career. He has worked with many legends in soul and blues, including John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles, George Benson, Eric Clapton, Bobby Womack, and BB King, along with The Chieftains, Gregory Porter, Michael Bublé, Joss Stone, Natalie Cole and Mark Knopfler.

===1980s===
Morrison and the internationally renowned Irish folk band The Chieftains recorded the album &quot;Irish Heartbeat&quot; (1988). Consisting of Irish folk songs, it entered the UK Top 20. &quot;Whenever God Shines His Light&quot;, on &quot;Avalon Sunset&quot; (1989), is a duet with Cliff Richard, which charted at No. 20 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 3 on the Irish Singles Chart. AllMusic critic Jason Ankeny found it to be a &quot;standout opener&quot; on the album. For critic Patrick Humphries, it was &quot;the most manifest example of Morrison&#x27;s Christian commitment,&quot; and while &quot;not one of Morrison&#x27;s most outstanding songs&quot; it works as &quot;a testament of faith&quot;.

===1990s===
The decade saw an upsurge in Van Morrison&#x27;s collaborations. He developed a close association with two vocal talents at opposite ends of their careers: Georgie Fame (with whom Morrison had already worked occasionally) lent his voice and Hammond organ skills to Morrison&#x27;s band; and Brian Kennedy&#x27;s vocals complemented the grizzled voice of Morrison, both in studio and live performances. He reunited with The Chieftains on their 1995 album, &quot;The Long Black Veil&quot;, with a reworking of Morrison&#x27;s song &quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot; winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. He produced, and was featured on, several tracks with blues legend John Lee Hooker on Hooker&#x27;s 1997 album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;. This album won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album in 1998, and the title track &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, a duet with Morrison, took the Grammy for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. The project capped a series of Morrison and Hooker collaborations that began in 1971 when they performed a duet on the title track of Hooker&#x27;s 1972 album &quot;Never Get Out of These Blues Alive&quot;. On this album, Hooker also recorded a cover of Morrison&#x27;s &quot;T.B. Sheets&quot;. Morrison collaborated with Tom Jones on his 1999 album &quot;Reload&quot;, when the pair sang on Morrison&#x27;s song, &quot;Sometimes We Cry&quot;.

===2000s to present===
Morrison delivered vocals on &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; on Mark Knopfler&#x27;s &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; (2000), and that year also recorded a classic country music duet album, &quot;You Win Again&quot; with Linda Gail Lewis. The album received a three-star review from AllMusic, who called it &quot;a roots effort that never sounds studied&quot;. In 2004, Morrison was one of the guests on Ray Charles&#x27; album &quot;Genius Loves Company&quot;. The pair performed Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Love&quot;. In 2015 he recorded an album of collaborations, , which featured, among others, Steve Winwood, Taj Mahal, Mavis Staples, Mick Hucknall, and Morrison&#x27;s daughter Shana Morrison. Morrison also developed a partnership with Joey DeFrancesco, with the pair collaborating on a number of albums. During the COVID pandemic Morrison recorded tracks with Eric Clapton criticizing &#x27;harm-reduction&#x27; measures.

==Artistry==
===Vocals===
Featuring his characteristic growl—a mix of folk, blues, soul, jazz, gospel, and Ulster Scots Celtic influences—Morrison is widely considered by many rock historians to be one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock and roll. Critic Greil Marcus has said &quot;no white man sings like Van Morrison.&quot; In his 2010 book, Marcus wrote, &quot;As a physical fact, Morrison may have the richest and most expressive voice pop music has produced since Elvis Presley, and with a sense of himself as an artist that Elvis was always denied.&quot;

As Morrison began live performances of the 40-year-old album &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as &quot;flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive&quot;. Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic&#x27;s comments were favourable: &quot;Morrison&#x27;s voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth—softer on the diction—but none the less impressively powerful.&quot; Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: &quot;The approach now is to sing from lower down [the diaphragm] so I do not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly.&quot;

===Songwriting and lyrics===
Morrison has written hundreds of songs during his career with a recurring theme reflecting a nostalgic yearning for the carefree days of his childhood in Belfast. Some of his song titles derive from familiar locations in his childhood, such as &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot; (a nearby street), &quot;Orangefield&quot; (the boys&#x27; school he attended), and &quot;On Hyndford Street&quot; (where he was born). Also frequently present in Morrison&#x27;s best love songs is a blending of the sacred-profane as evidenced in &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; and &quot;So Quiet in Here&quot;.

Beginning with his 1979 album, &quot;Into the Music&quot;, and the song &quot;And the Healing Has Begun&quot;, a frequent theme of his music and lyrics has been based on his belief in the healing power of music combined with a form of mystic Christianity. This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.

His lyrics show the influence of the visionary poets William Blake and W. B. Yeats and others such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Biographer Brian Hinton believes &quot;like any great poet from Blake to Seamus Heaney he takes words back to their origins in magic ... Indeed, Morrison is returning poetry to its earliest roots—as in Homer or Old English epics like Beowulf or the Psalms or folk song—in all of which words and music combine to form a new reality.&quot; Another biographer, John Collis, believes Morrison&#x27;s style of jazz singing and repeating phrases preclude his lyrics from being regarded as poetry or as Collis asserts: &quot;he is more likely to repeat a phrase like a mantra, or burst into scat singing. The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry.&quot;

Morrison has described his songwriting method by remarking: &quot;I write from a different place. I do not even know what it is called or if it has a name. It just comes and I sculpt it, but it is also a lot of hard work doing the sculpting.&quot;

===Performance style===
Critic Greil Marcus argues that, given the truly distinctive breadth and complexity of Morrison&#x27;s work, it is almost impossible to cast his work among that of others: &quot;Morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock &amp; roll, a singer who cannot be pinned down, dismissed, or fitted into anyone&#x27;s expectations.&quot; Or in the words of Jay Cocks: &quot;He extends himself only to express himself. Alone among rock&#x27;s great figures—and even in that company he is one of the greatest—Morrison is adamantly inward. And unique. Although he freely crosses musical boundaries— R&amp;B, Celtic melodies, jazz, rave-up rock, hymns, down-and-dirty blues—he can unfailingly be found in the same strange place: on his own wavelength.&quot;

His spiritually themed style of music first came into full expression with &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; in 1968 and he was noted to have remained a &quot;master of his transcendental craft&quot; in 2009 while performing the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; songs live. This musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry. His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity. Scott Foundas with &quot;LA Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song; to achieve a total freedom of form; to take himself, his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known.&quot; Greil Marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in Morrison&#x27;s music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains: &quot;But in his music the same sense of escape from ordinary limits—a reach for, or the achievement of, a kind of violent transcendence—can come from hesitations, repetitions of words or phrases, pauses, the way a musical change by another musician is turned by Morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself. In these moments, the self is left behind, and the sound, that &quot;yarragh,&quot; becomes the active agent: a musical person, with its own mind, its own body.&quot; A book reviewer further described it as &quot;This transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two, neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one, like breath and life ...&quot;

Morrison has said he believes in the jazz improvisational technique of never performing a song the same way twice and except for the unique rendition of the &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; songs live, doesn&#x27;t perform a concert from a preconceived set list. Morrison has said he prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics. His ban against alcoholic beverages, which made entertainment news during 2008, was an attempt to prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances. In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: &quot;I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere. If anything, I aim to take myself there in my music. If the listener catches the wavelength of what I am saying or singing, or gets whatever point whatever line means to them, then I guess as a writer I may have done a day&#x27;s work.&quot;

===Genre===
The music of Van Morrison has encompassed many genres since his early days as a blues and R&amp;B singer in Belfast. Over the years he has recorded songs from a varying list of genres drawn from many influences and interests. As well as blues and R&amp;B, his compositions and covers have moved between pop music, jazz, rock, folk, country, gospel, Irish folk and traditional, big band, skiffle, rock and roll, new age, classical and sometimes spoken word (&quot;Coney Island&quot;) and instrumentals. Morrison defines himself as a soul singer.

Morrison&#x27;s music has been described by music journalist Alan Light as &quot;Celtic soul&quot;, or what biographer Brian Hinton referred to as a new alchemy called &quot;Caledonian soul.&quot; Another biographer, Ritchie Yorke quoted Morrison as believing that he has &quot;the spirit of Caledonia in his soul and his music reflects it.&quot; According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered &quot;a certain quality of soul&quot; when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of Ulster Scots descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke said Morrison &quot;discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old Irish and Scottish folk music.&quot;

===&#x27;Caledonia&#x27; theme===
The name &quot;Caledonia&quot; has played a prominent role in Morrison&#x27;s life and career. Biographer Ritchie Yorke had pointed out already by 1975 that Morrison has referred to Caledonia so many times in his career that he &quot;seems to be obsessed with the word&quot;. In his 2009 biography, Erik Hage found &quot;Morrison seemed deeply interested in his paternal Scottish roots during his early career, and later in the ancient countryside of England, hence his repeated use of the term &quot;Caledonia&quot; (an ancient Roman name for Scotland/northern Britain)&quot;. As well as being his daughter Shana&#x27;s middle name, it is the name of his first production company, his studio, his publishing company, two of his backing groups, his parents&#x27; record store in Fairfax, California in the 1970s, and he also recorded a cover of the song &quot;Caldonia&quot; (with the name spelt &quot;Caledonia&quot;) in 1974. Morrison used &quot;Caledonia&quot; in what has been called a quintessential Van Morrison moment in the song, &quot;Listen to the Lion&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;And we sail, and we sail, way up to Caledonia&quot;. Morrison used &quot;Caledonia&quot; as a mantra in the live performance of the song &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; recorded at the two Hollywood Bowl concerts. As late as 2016&#x27;s &quot;Keep Me Singing&quot; album, he recorded a self-penned instrumental entitled &quot;Caledonia Swing.&quot;

===Influence===
Morrison&#x27;s influence can readily be heard in the music of a diverse array of major artists. According to &quot;The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001), &quot;his influence among rock singers/song writers is unrivaled by any living artist outside of that other prickly legend, Bob Dylan. Echoes of Morrison&#x27;s rugged literateness and his gruff, feverish emotive vocals can be heard in latter day icons ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Elvis Costello&quot;. He has influenced an array of top tier performers, including U2, with Bono recalling, &quot;I am in awe of a musician like Van Morrison. I had to stop listening to Van Morrison records about six months before we made &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; because I didn&#x27;t want his very original soul voice to overpower my own&quot;. He has inspired John Mellencamp (&quot;Wild Night&quot;); Jim Morrison; Joan Armatrading (the only musical influence she will acknowledge); Nick Cave; Rod Stewart; Tom Petty; Rickie Lee Jones (recognises both Laura Nyro and Van Morrison as the main influences on her career); Elton John; Graham Parker; Sinéad O&#x27;Connor; Phil Lynott of Thin Lizzy; Bob Seger (&quot;I know Bruce Springsteen was very much affected by Van Morrison, and so was I&quot;) Kevin Rowland of Dexys Midnight Runners (&quot;Jackie Wilson Said&quot;); Jimi Hendrix (&quot;Gloria&quot;); Jeff Buckley (&quot;The Way Young Lovers Do&quot;, &quot;Sweet Thing&quot;); Nick Drake; and numerous others, including Counting Crows (their &quot;sha-la-la&quot; sequence in &quot;Mr Jones&quot; is a tribute to Morrison). Morrison&#x27;s influence reaches into the country music genre, with Hal Ketchum acknowledging, &quot;He (Van Morrison) was a major influence in my life.&quot; Ray Manzarek of the Doors described Van Morrison as &quot;our [the Doors] favourite singer&quot;.

Morrison has typically been supportive of other artists, often willingly sharing the stage with them during his concerts. On the live album &quot;A Night in San Francisco&quot;, he had as his special guests, among others, his childhood idols: Jimmy Witherspoon, John Lee Hooker and Junior Wells. Although he often expresses his displeasure (in interviews and songs) with the music industry and the media in general, he has been instrumental in promoting the careers of many other musicians and singers, such as James Hunter, and fellow Belfast-born brothers Brian and Bap Kennedy. He has also influenced the visual arts: the German painter Johannes Heisig created a series of lithographs illustrating the book &quot;In the Garden – for Van Morrison&quot;, published by Städtische Galerie Sonneberg, Germany, in 1997.

====Next generation====
Morrison&#x27;s influence on a younger generation of singer-songwriters is pervasive. The list of such singer-songwriters influenced by Morrison includes Irish singer Damien Rice, who has been described as on his way to becoming the &quot;natural heir to Van Morrison&quot;; Ray Lamontagne; James Morrison; Paolo Nutini; Eric Lindell David Gray and Ed Sheeran are also several of the younger artists influenced by Morrison. Glen Hansard of the Irish rock band the Frames (who lists Van Morrison as being part of his holy trinity with Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen) commonly covers his songs in concert. American rock band the Wallflowers have covered &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;. Canadian blues-rock singer Colin James also covers the song frequently at his concerts. Actor and musician Robert Pattinson has said Van Morrison was his &quot;influence for doing music in the first place&quot;. Morrison has shared the stage with Northern Irish singer-songwriter Duke Special, who admits Morrison has been a big influence.

==Recognition and legacy==
Morrison has received several major music awards in his career, including two Grammy Awards, with five additional nominations (1982–2004); inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (January 1993), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (June 2003), and the Irish Music Hall of Fame (September 1999); and a Brit Award (February 1994). In addition, he has received civil awards: an OBE (June 1996) and an Officier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1996). He has honorary doctorates from the University of Ulster (1992) and from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (July 2001).

===Halls of Fame===
The Hall of Fame inductions began in 1993 with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Morrison was the first living inductee not to attend his own ceremony, – Robbie Robertson from the Band accepted the award on his behalf. When Morrison became the initial musician inducted into the Irish Music Hall of Fame, Bob Geldof presented Morrison with the award. Morrison&#x27;s third induction was into the Songwriters Hall of Fame for &quot;recognition of his unique position as one of the most important songwriters of the past century&quot;. Ray Charles presented the award, following a performance during which the pair performed Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Crazy Love&quot; from the album &quot;Moondance&quot;. Morrison&#x27;s BRIT Award was for his &quot;Outstanding Contribution to British Music&quot;. Former Beirut hostage John McCarthy presented the award; while testifying to the importance of Morrison&#x27;s song &quot;Wonderful Remark.” McCarthy called it &quot;a song ... which was very important to us.&quot;

Three of Morrison&#x27;s songs appear in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll: &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, &quot;Madame George&quot; and &quot;Moondance&quot;. The Songwriter&#x27;s Hall of Fame awarded Morrison the Johnny Mercer Award on 18 June 2015 at their 46th Annual Induction and Awards Dinner in New York City.

===Civil awards and honours===
Morrison received two civil awards in 1996: he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to music, and was also recognized with an award from the French government which made him an &quot;Officier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres&quot;. Along with these state awards he has two honorary degrees in music: an honorary doctorate in literature from the University of Ulster, and an honorary doctorate in music from Queen&#x27;s University in his hometown of Belfast.

In 2013, Morrison was awarded the Freedom of Belfast, the highest honour the city can bestow. On 15 November 2013, Morrison became the 79th recipient of the award, presented at the Waterfront Hall for his career achievements. After receiving the award, he performed a free concert for residents who won tickets from a lottery system.

In August 2014, a &quot;Van Morrison Trail&quot; was established in East Belfast by Morrison in partnership with the Connswater Community Greenway. It is a self-guided trail, which over the course of leads to eight places that were important to Morrison and inspirational to his music.

Morrison was made a Knight Bachelor in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in 2015 for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland. The ceremony was performed by Prince Charles.

===Industry recognition===
Other awards include an Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1995, the BMI ICON award in October 2004 for Morrison&#x27;s &quot;enduring influence on generations of music makers&quot;, and an &quot;Oscar Wilde: Honouring Irish Writing in Film&quot; award in 2007 for his contribution to over fifty films, presented by Al Pacino, who compared Morrison to Oscar Wilde – both &quot;visionaries who push boundaries&quot;. He was voted the Best International Male Singer of 2007 at the inaugural International Awards in Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club, London.

In 2010, Morrison was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. On 2 September 2014, Morrison was presented with the &quot;Legend&quot; award at the &quot;GQ&quot; Men of the Year ceremony at Royal Opera House in London. On 13 October 2014, Morrison received his fifth BMI Million-Air Award for 11 million radio plays of the song &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, making it one of the Top 10 Songs of all time on US radio and television. Morrison has also received Million-Air awards for &quot;Have I Told You Lately&quot;. In 2017, the Americana Music Association gave Van Morrison the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting.

Morrison was chosen to be honoured by Michael Dorf at his annual charity concert at Carnegie Hall. The Music of Van Morrison was performed on 21 March 2019 by twenty musical acts including Glen Hansard, Patti Smith and Bettye LaVette. In 2019, Morrison received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Jimmy Page during the International Achievement Summit in New York City.

In 2022, Morrison and his song &quot;Down to Joy&quot; for &quot;Belfast&quot; were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 94th Academy Awards.

===Lists===
Morrison has also appeared in a number of &quot;Greatest&quot; lists, including the &quot;TIME&quot; magazine list of The All-Time 100 Albums, which contained &quot;Astral Weeks&quot; and &quot;Moondance&quot;, and he appeared at number thirteen on the list of WXPN&#x27;s 885 All Time Greatest Artists. In 2000, Morrison ranked twenty-fifth on American cable music channel VH1&#x27;s list of its &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Rock and Roll&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Family and relationships===
Morrison lived in Belfast from birth until 1964, when he moved to London with the rock group Them. Three years later, he moved to New York after signing with Bang Records. Facing deportation due to visa problems, he managed to stay in the US when his American girlfriend Janet (Planet) Rigsbee, who had a son named Peter from a previous relationship, agreed to marry him. Once married, Morrison and his wife moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he found work performing in local clubs. The couple had one daughter in 1970, Shana Morrison, who has become a singer-songwriter. Morrison and his family moved around America, living in Boston; Woodstock, New York; and a hilltop home in Fairfax, California. His wife appeared on the cover of the album &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot;. They divorced in 1973.

Morrison moved back to the UK in the late 1970s, first settling in London&#x27;s Notting Hill Gate area. Later, he moved to Bath, where he purchased the Wool Hall studio in January 1994. He also has a home in the Irish seaside village of Dalkey near Dublin, where legal actions were taken against Morrison by two neighbours who objected to Morrison attempting to widen his driveway. The case was taken to court in 2001, with the initial rulings going against Morrison. Morrison pursued the matter all the way to the Irish Supreme Court, but his appeal was denied. A separate case in 2010, in which Morrison&#x27;s then-wife Michelle took legal action against a different neighbour, who was building a balcony that she felt would overlook the Morrison home and intrude on their privacy, was withdrawn in 2015.

Morrison met Irish socialite Michelle Rocca in the summer of 1992, and they often featured in the Dublin gossip columns, an unusual event for the reclusive Morrison. Rocca also appeared on one of his album covers, &quot;Days Like This&quot;. The couple married and have two children; a daughter was born in February 2006 and a son in August 2007. According to a statement posted on his website, they were divorced in March 2018.

In December 2009, Morrison&#x27;s tour manager Gigi Lee gave birth to a son, who she asserted was Morrison&#x27;s and named after him. Lee announced the birth of the child on Morrison&#x27;s official website, but Morrison denied paternity. Lee&#x27;s son died in January 2011 from complications of diabetes, and Lee died soon after from throat cancer in October 2011. Morrison&#x27;s father died in 1988, and his mother, Violet, died in 2016.

===Religion and spirituality===
Morrison and his family have been affiliated with St Donard&#x27;s Parish Church, an Anglican congregation of the Church of Ireland located in east Belfast. During the Troubles, the area was described as &quot;militantly Protestant&quot;, although Morrison&#x27;s parents have always been freethinkers, with his father openly declaring himself an atheist and his mother being connected to Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses at one point. Van Morrison was linked to Scientology for a short time and even thanked its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, in one of his songs. Later, he became wary of religion, saying: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t touch it with a 10-foot pole.&quot; He also said it is important to distinguish spirituality from religion: &quot;Spirituality is one thing, religion ... can mean anything from soup to nuts, you know? But it generally means an organisation, so I don&#x27;t really like to use the word, because that&#x27;s what it really means. It really means this church or that church ... but spirituality is different, because that&#x27;s the individual.&quot;

===The Troubles===
Morrison left Northern Ireland before The Troubles started and distanced himself from the conflict, although later &quot;yearned for&quot; Protestant and Catholic reconciliation. In 1972, he gave an interview with the Dublin-based magazine &quot;Spotlight&quot;, in which he said, &quot;I&#x27;m definitely Irish ... I don&#x27;t think I want to go back to Belfast. I don&#x27;t miss it with all the prejudice around. We&#x27;re all the same and I think it&#x27;s terrible what&#x27;s happening. But I&#x27;d like to get a house in Ireland ... I&#x27;d like to spend a few months there every year.&quot;

<text>Systems Network Architecture (SNA) is IBM&#x27;s proprietary networking architecture, created in 1974. It is a complete protocol stack for interconnecting computers and their resources. SNA describes formats and protocols but, in itself, is not a piece of software. The implementation of SNA takes the form of various communications packages, most notably Virtual Telecommunications Access Method (VTAM), the mainframe software package for SNA communications.

==History==

SNA was made public as part of IBM&#x27;s &quot;Advanced Function for Communications&quot; announcement in September, 1974, which included the implementation of the SNA/SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control) protocols on new communications products:
*IBM 3767 communication terminal (printer)
*IBM 3770 data communication system
They were supported by IBM 3704/3705 communication controllers and their Network Control Program (NCP), and by System/370 and their VTAM and other software such as CICS and IMS. This announcement was followed by another announcement in July, 1975, which introduced the IBM 3760 data entry station, the IBM 3790 communication system, and the new models of the IBM 3270 display system.

SNA was designed in the era when the computer industry had not fully adopted the concept of layered communication. Applications, databases, and communication functions were mingled into the same protocol or product, which made it difficult to maintain and manage. SNA was mainly designed by the IBM Systems Development Division laboratory in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA, helped by other laboratories that implemented SNA/SDLC. IBM later made the details public in its System Reference Library manuals and IBM Systems Journal.

It is still used extensively in banks and other financial transaction networks, as well as in many government agencies. In 1999 there were an estimated 3,500 companies &quot;with 11,000 SNA mainframes.&quot; One of the primary pieces of hardware, the 3745/3746 communications controller, has been withdrawn from the market by IBM. IBM continues to provide hardware maintenance service and microcode features to support users. A robust market of smaller companies continues to provide the 3745/3746, features, parts, and service. VTAM is also supported by IBM, as is the NCP required by the 3745/3746 controllers.

In 2008 an IBM publication said:
==Objectives of SNA==
IBM in the mid-1970s saw itself mainly as a hardware vendor and hence all its innovations in that period aimed to increase hardware sales. SNA&#x27;s objective was to reduce the costs of operating large numbers of terminals and thus induce customers to develop or expand interactive terminal-based systems as opposed to batch systems. An expansion of interactive terminal-based systems would increase sales of terminals and more importantly of mainframe computers and peripherals - partly because of the simple increase in the volume of work done by the systems and partly because interactive processing requires more computing power per transaction than batch processing.

Hence SNA aimed to reduce the main non-computer costs and other difficulties in operating large networks using earlier communications protocols. The difficulties included:
*Often a communications line could not be shared by terminals of different types, as they used different &quot;dialects&quot; of the existing communications protocols. Up to the early 1970s, computer components were so expensive and bulky that it was not feasible to include all-purpose communications interface cards in terminals. Every type of terminal had a hard-wired communications card which supported only the operation of one type of terminal without compatibility with other types of terminals on the same line.
*The protocols which the primitive communications cards could handle were not efficient. Each communications line used more time transmitting data than modern lines do.
*Telecommunications lines at the time were of much lower quality. For example, it was almost impossible to run a dial-up line at more than 19,200 bits per second because of the overwhelming error rate, as compared with 56,000 bits per second today on dial-up lines; and in the early 1970s few leased lines were run at more than 2400 bits per second (these low speeds are a consequence of Shannon&#x27;s Law in a relatively low-technology environment).

As a result, running a large number of terminals required a lot more communications lines than the number required today, especially if different types of terminals needed to be supported, or the users wanted to use different types of applications (.e.g. under CICS or TSO) from the same location. In purely financial terms SNA&#x27;s objectives were to increase customers&#x27; spending on terminal-based systems and at the same time to increase IBM&#x27;s share of that spending, mainly at the expense of the telecommunications companies.

SNA also aimed to overcome a limitation of the architecture which IBM&#x27;s System/370 mainframes inherited from System/360. Each CPU could connect to at most 16 I/O channels and each channel could handle up to 256 peripherals - i.e. there was a maximum of 4096 peripherals per CPU. At the time when SNA was designed, each communications line counted as a peripheral. Thus the number of terminals with which powerful mainframes could otherwise communicate was limited.

==Principal components and technologies==
Improvements in computer component technology made it feasible to build terminals that included more powerful communications cards which could operate a single standard communications protocol rather than a very stripped-down protocol which suited only a specific type of terminal. As a result, several multi-layer communications protocols were proposed in the 1970s, of which IBM&#x27;s SNA and ITU-T&#x27;s X.25 became dominant later.

The most important elements of SNA include:
*IBM Network Control Program (NCP) is a communications program running on the 3705 and subsequent 37xx communications processors that, among other things, implements the packet switching protocol defined by SNA. The protocol performed two main functions:
**It is a packet forwarding protocol, acting like modern switch - forwarding data packages to the next node, which might be a mainframe, a terminal or another 3705. The communications processors supported only hierarchical networks with a mainframe at the center, unlike modern routers which support peer-to-peer networks in which a machine at the end of the line can be both a client and a server at the same time.
**It is a multiplexer that connected multiple terminals into one communication line to the CPU, thus relieved the constraints on the maximum number of communication lines per CPU. A 3705 could support a larger number of lines (352 initially) but only counted as one peripheral by the CPUs and channels. Since the launch of SNA IBM has introduced improved communications processors, of which the latest is the 3745.
*Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), a protocol which greatly improved the efficiency of data transfer over a single link:
**It is a sliding window protocol, which enables terminals and 3705 communications processors to send frames of data one after the other without waiting for an acknowledgement of the previous frame – the communications cards had sufficient memory and processing capacity to remember the last 7 frames sent or received, request re-transmission of only those frames which contained errors, and slot the re-transmitted frames into the right place in the sequence before forwarding them to the next stage.
**These frames all had the same type of envelope (frame header and trailer) which contained enough information for data packages from different types of terminal to be sent along the same communications line, leaving the mainframe to deal with any differences in the formatting of the content or in the rules governing dialogs with different types of terminal.
:Remote terminals (e.g., those connected to the mainframe by telephone lines) and 3705 communications processors would have SDLC-capable communications cards.
:This is the precursor of the packet communication that eventually evolved into today&#x27;s TCP/IP technology. SDLC itself evolved into HDLC, one of the base technologies for dedicated telecommunication circuits.
*VTAM, a software package to provide log-in, session keeping, and routing services within the mainframe. A terminal user would log-in via VTAM to a specific application or application environment (e.g. CICS, IMS, DB2, or TSO/ISPF). A VTAM device would then route data from that terminal to the appropriate application or application environment until the user logged out and possibly logged into another application. The original versions of IBM hardware could only keep one session per terminal. In the 1980s further software (mainly from third-party vendors) made it possible for a terminal to have simultaneous sessions with different applications or application environments.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
SNA removed link control from the application program and placed it in the NCP. This had the following advantages and disadvantages:

===Advantages===
*Localization of problems in the telecommunications network was easier because a relatively small amount of software actually dealt with communication links. There was a single error reporting system.
*Adding communication capability to an application program was much easier because the formidable area of link control software that typically requires interrupt processors and software timers was relegated to system software and NCP.
*With the advent of Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking (APPN), routing functionality was the responsibility of the computer as opposed to the router (as with TCP/IP networks). Each computer maintained a list of Nodes that defined the forwarding mechanisms. A centralized node type known as a Network Node maintained Global tables of all other node types. APPN stopped the need to maintain Advanced Program-to-Program Communication (APPC) routing tables that explicitly defined endpoint to endpoint connectivity. APPN sessions would route to endpoints through other allowed node types until it found the destination. This is similar to the way that routers for the Internet Protocol and the Netware Internetwork Packet Exchange protocol function. (APPN is also sometimes referred to PU2.1 or Physical Unit 2.1. APPC, also sometime referred to LU6.2 or Logical Unit 6.2, was the only protocol defined to APPN networks, but was originally one of many protocols supported by VTAM/NCP, along with LU0, LU1, LU2 (3270 Terminal), and LU3. APPC was primarily used between CICS environments, as well as database services, because it contact protocols for 2-phase commit processing). Physical Units were PU5 (VTAM), PU4 (37xx), PU2 (Cluster Controller). A PU5 was the most capable and considered the primary on all communication. Other PU devices requested a connection from the PU5 and the PU5 could establish the connection or not. The other PU types could only be secondary to the PU5. A PU2.1 added the ability to a PU2.1 to connect to another PU2.1 in a peer-to-peer environment.)

===Disadvantages===
*Connection to non-SNA networks was difficult. An application that needed access to some communication scheme not supported in the current version of SNA would have faced obstacles. Before IBM included X.25 support (NPSI) in SNA, connecting to an X.25 network would have been awkward. Conversion between X.25 and SNA protocols could have been provided either by NCP software modifications or by an external protocol converter.
*A sheaf of alternate pathways between every pair of nodes in a network had to be predesigned and stored centrally. Choice among these pathways by SNA was rigid and did not take advantage of current link loads for optimum speed.
*SNA network installation and maintenance are complicated and SNA network products are (or were) expensive. Attempts to reduce SNA network complexity by adding IBM Advanced Peer-to-Peer Networking functionality were not really successful, if only because the migration from traditional SNA to SNA/APPN was very complex, without providing much additional value, at least initially. SNA software licences (VTAM) cost as much as $10,000 a month for high-end systems. And SNA IBM 3745 Communications Controllers typically cost over $100K. TCP/IP was still seen as unfit for commercial applications e.g. in the finance industry until the late 1980s, but rapidly took over in the 1990s due to its peer-to-peer networking and packet communication technology.
*SNA&#x27;s connection based architecture invoked huge state machine logic to keep track of everything. APPN added a new dimension to state logic with its concept of differing node types. While it was solid when everything was running correctly, there was still a need for manual intervention. Simple things like watching the Control Point sessions had to be done manually. APPN wasn&#x27;t without issues; in the early days many shops abandoned it due to issues found in APPN support. Over time, however, many of the issues were worked out but not before TCP/IP became increasingly popular in the early 1990s, which marked the beginning of the end for SNA.

==Security==
==Network Addressable Units==
&quot;Network Addressable Units&quot; in a SNA network are any components that can be assigned an address and can send and receive information. They are distinguished further as follows:
* a &quot;System Services Control Point&quot; (SSCP) provides resource management and other session services (such as directory services) for users in a subarea network;
* a &quot;Physical Unit&quot; is a combination of hardware and software components that control the links to other nodes.
* a &quot;Logical Unit&quot; acts as the intermediary between the user and the network.

===Logical Unit (LU)===
SNA essentially offers transparent communication: equipment specifics that do not impose any constraints onto LU-LU communication. But eventually it serves a purpose to make a distinction between LU types, as the application must take the functionality of the terminal equipment into account (e.g. screen sizes and layout).

Within SNA there are three types of data stream to connect local display terminals and printers; there is SNA Character String (SCS), used for LU1 terminals and for logging on to an SNA network with Unformatted System Services (USS), there is the 3270 data stream mainly used by mainframes such as the System/370 and successors, including the zSeries family, and the 5250 data stream mainly used by minicomputers/servers such as the System/34, System/36, System/38, and AS/400 and its successors, including System i and IBM Power Systems running IBM i.

SNA defines several kinds of devices, called Logical Unit types:
*LU0 provides for undefined devices, or build your own protocol. This is also used for non-SNA 3270 devices supported by TCAM or VTAM.
*LU1 devices are printers or combinations of keyboards and printers.
*LU2 devices are IBM 3270 display terminals.
*LU3 devices are printers using 3270 protocols.
*LU4 devices are batch terminals.
*LU5 has never been defined.
*LU6 provides for protocols between two applications.
*LU7 provides for sessions with IBM 5250 terminals.
The primary ones in use are LU1, LU2, and LU6.2 (an advanced protocol for application to application conversations).

===Physical Unit (PU)===
*PU1 nodes are terminal controllers such as IBM 6670 or IBM 3767
*PU2 nodes are cluster controllers running configuration support programs such as IBM 3174, IBM 3274, or the IBM 4701 or IBM 4702 Branch Controller
*PU2.1 nodes are peer-to-peer (APPN) nodes
*PU3 was never defined
*PU4 nodes are front-end processors running the Network Control Program (NCP) such as the IBM 37xx series
*PU5 nodes are host computer systems

The term 37xx refers to IBM&#x27;s family of SNA communications controllers. The 3745 supports up to eight high-speed T1 circuits, the 3725 is a large-scale node and front-end processor for a host, and the 3720 is a remote node that functions as a concentrator and router.

==SNA over Token-Ring==
VTAM/NCP PU4 nodes attached to IBM Token Ring networks can share the same Local Area Network infrastructure with workstations and servers. NCP encapsulates SNA packets into Token-Ring frames, allowing sessions to flow over a Token-Ring network. The actual encapsulation and decapsulation takes place in the 3745.

==SNA over IP==
As mainframe-based entities looked for alternatives to their 37XX-based networks, IBM partnered with Cisco in the mid-1990s and together they developed Data Link Switching, or DLSw. DLSw encapsulates SNA packets into IP datagrams, allowing sessions to flow over an IP network. The actual encapsulation and decapsulation takes place in Cisco routers at each end of a DLSw peer connection. At the local, or mainframe site, the router uses Token Ring topology to connect natively to VTAM. At the remote (user) end of the connection, a PU type 2 emulator (such as an SNA gateway server) connects to the peer router via the router&#x27;s LAN interface. End user terminals are typically PCs with 3270 emulation software that is defined to the SNA gateway. The VTAM/NCP PU type 2 definition becomes a Switched Major Node that can be local to VTAM (without an NCP), and a &quot;Line&quot; connection can be defined using various possible solutions (such as a Token Ring interface on the 3745, a 3172 Lan Channel Station, or a Cisco ESCON-compatible Channel Interface Processor).

==Competitors==
The proprietary networking architecture for Honeywell Bull mainframes is Distributed Systems Architecture (DSA). The Communications package for DSA is VIP. DSA is also no longer supported for client access. Bull mainframes are fitted with Mainway for translating DSA to TCP/IP and VIP devices are replaced by TNVIP Terminal Emulations (GLink, Winsurf). GCOS 8 supports TNVIP SE over TCP/IP.

The networking architecture for Univac mainframes was the Distributed Computing Architecture (DCA), and the networking architecture for Burroughs mainframes was the Burroughs Network Architecture (BNA); after they merged to form Unisys, both were provided by the merged company. Both were largely obsolete by 2012. International Computers Limited (ICL) provided its Information Processing Architecture (IPA).

DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation, originally released in 1975 to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers. It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s.

SNA also competed with ISO&#x27;s Open Systems Interconnection, which was an attempt to create a vendor-neutral network architecture that failed due to the problems of &quot;design by committee&quot;. OSI systems are very complex, and the many parties involved required extensive flexibilities that hurt the interoperability of OSI systems, which was the prime objective to start with.

The TCP/IP suite for many years was not considered a serious alternative by IBM, due in part to the lack of control over the intellectual property. The 1988 publication of , authored by Yakov Rekhter, which defines an option to run IBM 3270 sessions over Telnet, explicitly recognizes the customer demand for interoperability in the data center. Subsequently, the IETF expanded on this work with multiple other RFCs. TN3270 (Telnet 3270), defined by those RFCs, supports direct client-server connections to the mainframe using a TN3270 server on the mainframe, and a TN3270 emulation package on the computer at the end user site. This protocol allows existing VTAM applications (CICS, TSO) to run with little or no change from traditional SNA by supporting traditional 3270 terminal protocol over the TCP/IP session. This protocol is widely used to replace legacy SNA connectivity more than Data-Link Switching (DLSw) and other SNA replacement technologies. A similar TN5250 (Telnet 5250) variant exists for the IBM 5250.

==Non-IBM SNA implementations==
Non-IBM SNA software allowed systems other than IBM&#x27;s to communicate with IBM&#x27;s mainframes and AS/400 midrange computers using the SNA protocols.

Some Unix system vendors, such as Sun Microsystems with its SunLink SNA product line, including PU2.1 Server, and Hewlett-Packard/Hewlett Packard Enterprise, with their SNAplus2 product, provided SNA software.

Microsoft introduced SNA Server for Windows in 1993; it is now named Microsoft Host Integration Server.

Digital Equipment Corporation had VMS/SNA for VMS. Third-party SNA software packages for VMS, such as the VAX Link products from Systems Strategies, Inc., were also available.

Hewlett-Packard offered SNA Server and SNA Access for its HP 3000 systems.

Brixton Systems developed several SNA software packages, sold under the name &quot;&quot;, such as Brixton BrxPU21, BrxPU5, BrxLU62, and BrxAPPC, for systems such as workstations from Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems.

IBM supported using several non-IBM software implementations of APPC/PU2.1/LU6.2 to communicate with z/OS, including SNAplus2 for systems from HP, Brixton 4.1 SNA for Sun Solaris, and SunLink SNA 9.1 Support for Sun Solaris.

<text>The flag of Chile consists of two equal-height horizontal bands of white and red, with a blue square the same height as the white band in the canton, which bears a white five-pointed star in its center. It was adopted on 18 October 1817. The Chilean flag is also known in Spanish as &quot;La Estrella Solitaria&quot; (&quot;The Lone Star&quot;).

It has a 3:2 ratio between length and width, it is divided horizontally into two bands of equal height (the lower being red). The upper area is divided once: into a square (blue), with a single centered white star; and into a rectangle (white), whose lengths are in proportion 1:2. It is in the stars and stripes flag family.

The star represents Venus, significant to the country&#x27;s indigenous Mapuches, symbolizing a guide to progress and honor while other interpretations say it refers to an independent state; blue symbolizes the sky and the Pacific Ocean, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence.

According to the epic poem &quot;La Araucana&quot;, the colors were derived from those from the flag flown by the Mapuche during the Arauco War. &quot;Flag Day&quot; is held each year on the ninth of July to commemorate the 77 soldiers who died in the 1882 Battle of La Concepción.

==History of Chile==

===Pre-Independence flags===

The first records on the possible use of flags by indigenous peoples date back to the War of Arauco, the most famous being the use described in the late 16th-century epic poem &quot;La Araucana&quot;. In Canto XXI, Alonso de Ercilla described Talcahuano, warrior and chief of the Mapuche who work the lands near the present-day city that bears his name, bearing emblems of blue, white and red.

Two flags have been documented as used by Mapuche troops. However, these descriptions were made late in the eighteenth century without certainty about the age of them. One consisted of a five-pointed white star on a blue background similar to the canton of the current Chilean flag, while the second had a white eight-pointed star centered on a blue diamond with border zigzagged over a black background. The latter flag appears to be waved by the chief Lautaro in the best-known artistic representation of it, created by painter Pedro Subercaseaux.

The main symbol of this flag is the star of Arauco, called guñelve, representing the flower of the canelo and the bright star of Venus. In the independence of Chile, Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins said that guñelve was the direct inspiration for creating the Chilean flag with the Lone Star.

In the case of the colonizing troops, they used several Spanish flags. Each battalion had its own flag, which could incorporate different elements including the heraldic coat of arms of the King of Spain. One of the symbols most commonly used was the Cross of Burgundy, a jagged, red saltire crossed on a white cloth. The Cross of Burgundy was one of the main symbols of the Spanish Empire overseas, so it flew over the warships and was carried by the militia in the colonial territory during the Spanish colonization of the Americas.

In 1785, Carlos III established a uniform flag for all ships of the Spanish Armada, similar to the current flag of Spain. The use of this red-and-yellow flag would be extended in 1793 to &quot;maritime towns, castles and coastal defenses.&quot; Despite the establishment of this new flag, the cross of Burgundy would still often used by colonial entities.

===Flag of the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; (1812–1814)===

At the onset of the Chilean War of Independence, the First Government Junta was proclaimed on 18 September 1810, marking Chile&#x27;s first step toward independence. It would be during the government of Jose Miguel Carrera in which the desire for emancipation would gain more strength. Nevertheless, the junta was established (at least nominally) as a way of controlling the government during the absence of King Fernando VII, so that the symbols of government remained Hispanic. Therefore, one of the first acts of his government would be the implementation of national symbols, such as an insignia, a coat of arms and a distinctive flag to identify the patriots. The first flag, according to tradition, would have been embroidered by the sister of the ruler, Javiera Carrera, and would be presented and raised for the first time on 4 July 1812 at a dinner with the United States consul Joel Roberts Poinsett to celebrate the anniversary of U.S. independence, an event having a great influence on the locals&#x27; struggle for independence.

Named the flag of the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; (&quot;Old Fatherland&quot;), the flag had three horizontal stripes of blue, white and yellow. For some, the bands represent the three branches of government: majesty popular, law and force, respectively; to others, the stripes represent features of nature: the sky, the snowy Andes and fields of golden wheat, respectively. The following 30 September, during a celebration in the capital to commemorate the first government junta, the Chilean coat of arms, also called &quot;Patria Vieja&quot;, was solemnly adopted and included in the center of the flag.

Although the blue-white-yellow flag of the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; was the most recognized, other versions utilized a different arrangement of the colors, such as white-blue-yellow, for example. On other occasions, the red Cross of Santiago was included in the upper left corner together with the coat of arms in the center. The cross originates from the victory of the patriot troops in the Battle of El Roble, where within the possessions of the captured war booty was a distinctive insignia of the Order of St. James, an important symbol of Spanish pride.

In 1813 after the royalist invasion and the outbreak of the War of Independence, the Spanish symbols were abolished and the tricolor flag was formally adopted by the patriotic forces in a ceremony at the Plaza Mayor of Santiago. Months later in 1814, Carrera left political and military power, and Francisco de la Lastra was chosen as Supreme director. The war of independence began at great losses for the patriot side, and so signed the Treaty of Lircay on 3 May 1814. This agreement reaffirmed the Spanish sovereignty over the territory of Chile, among other things, and as one of its direct consequences, the Spanish flag was readopted at the expense of the tricolor.

The flag of the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; would wave again after Carrera&#x27;s return to power 23 July 1814 until the Battle of Rancagua (1–2 October) where the royalist victory ended the patriot government and began the &quot;Reconquista&quot; (or &quot;Reconquest&quot;) from 1814 to 1817, restoring the imperial standard. The tricolor flag was last flown for the last time in the Battle of Los Papeles (&quot;Batalla de los Papeles&quot;), but it would appear again raised in the ships that José Miguel Carrera brought in 1817 and during his campaigns in Argentina (1820–1821). The Reconquista ended with the victory of Liberation Army of the Andes (&quot;Ejército Liberatador de los Andes&quot;) in the Battle of Chacabuco on 12 February 1817. In this battle, the patriot troops fought with the army colonel and the flag of the Army of the Andes, inspired by the flag of Argentina, without readopting the blue-white-yellow standard.

Today, the flag of the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; is used during memorial services for moose Chilean historical period, conducted by the National Institute (&quot;Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera&quot;), which Carrera&#x27;s government founded (10 August 1813). The emblem, adopted as a symbol at the beginning of carrerismo, was subsequently adopted by Chilean nationalism movement. For example, the flag with a red lightning bolt emblem superimposed was the insignia of the National Socialist Movement of Chile between 1932 and 1938.

===Flag of the Transition (1817–1818)===
 The victory at the Battle of Chacabuco on 26 May 1817 gave way to a new period known as the &quot;Patria Nueva&quot; (&quot;New Fatherland&quot;). A new flag was adopted that day, known today as the Flag of the Transition (&quot;Bandera de la Transición&quot;), and it is recognized as the first national flag and the last flag used until the one used currently. It was widely publicized at the time that the design was attributed to Juan Gregorio de Las Heras. This flag had three equal stripes: blue, white, and red, which is identical to the flag of pre-communist Yugoslavia (the flag of Serbia and Montenegro later). The bottom red strip replaced the yellow from the flag of 1812. The origin of the flag&#x27;s colors would be based on the description given by Alonso de Ercilla as those of the insignia of the Mapuche troops. The significances of these colors were equivalent to those of the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot;, except that the yellow replaced the red to represent the blood that had been shed during the many conflicts.

Despite initial enthusiasm, the flag did not obtain official legalization and disappeared five months later. One reason for its suppression was that it was easily confused with both the flag of the Netherlands and the tricolor of revolutionary France, from which it was inspired.

According to the &quot;General History of Chile&quot; by Diego Barros Arana, the last time the Flag of the Transition was unfurled was at the ceremony to commemorate the Battle of Rancagua, two weeks before the adoption of the current national flag. However, there is information about a possible third flag between the Transitional and final, which would have exchanged the order of white and blue stripes and incorporated the five-pointed white star on the central strip, but that is no certainty, and it is not accepted by the majority of Chilean historians.

===Third and current flag===
The design of the current Chilean flag is commonly attributed to Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins&#x27;s Minister of War, José Ignacio Zenteno, having been designed by the Spanish soldier Antonio Arcos, although historians argue that it was Gregorio de Andía y Varela who drew it.

The flag was made official on 18 October 1817 by a decree, of which only indirect references to the absence of a copy thereof, which was officially presented during the Pledge of Independence ceremony on 12 February 1818, a ceremony in which the bearer was Tomás Guido.

The original flag was designed according to the Golden Ratio, which is reflected in the relation between the widths of the white and blue parts of the flag, as well as several elements in blue canton. The star does not appear upright in the center of the rectangular canton, instead the upper point appears slightly inclined toward the pole in such a way that the projection of its sides divide the length of the canton golden proportion. Additionally, in the center is printed the National Coat of Arms, known from the previous Flag of the Transition and adopted in 1817.
The adoption of the star configuration goes back to the star used by the Mapuches. According to O&#x27;Higgins, the star of the flag was the Star of Arauco. In Mapuche iconography, the morning star or Venus, (Mapudungun: &quot;Wünelfe&quot; or the Hispanicized &quot;Guñelve&quot;) was represented through the figure of an octagram star or a foliated cross. Although, the star which was finally adopted bore a star having five points with the design of the &quot;guñelve&quot; remaining reflected in an asterisk inserted in the center of the star, representing the combination of European and indigenous traditions.

These designs soon fell into oblivion due to the difficulty in the flag&#x27;s construction. So, the embroidered seal and the eight-pointed asterisk disappeared while the star was kept completely upright. In 1854 the proportion was determined in keeping with the colors of the flag, leaving the canton as a square and the ratio of hoist to fly set to 2:3. Finally, in 1912, the diameter of the star was established, the precedence of the colors in the presidential flag and decorative cockade was determined, setting the order as blue, white and red from top to bottom or from left to right of the viewer.

All of these arrangements would later be recast into Supreme Decree No. 1534 of 1967 from the Ministry of the Interior during the government of Eduardo Frei Montalva. In this document, the national emblems, coat of arms, the rosette or cockade, and the presidential standard were established. Meanwhile, the Political Constitution of Chile of 1980 establishes in the first clause of article 222 that all inhabitants of the republic should respect Chile and its national emblems.
Few records remain of the original design, the most valuable being that of the flag used in the Declaration of Independence, which had a width of two meters and a length just over two feet. The flag was protected by various hereditary institutions until it was stolen in 1980 by members of the Revolutionary Left Movement as a protest against the military dictatorship. This group kept the specimen and returned it in late 2003 to the National Historical Museum, where it can be found today.

There is a rather popular legend in Chile that claims this third Chilean flag won a &quot;Most Beautiful National Flag in the World&quot; contest. Its most common version states that this happened in 1907 in Blankenberge, Belgium, in the coast of the Baltic Sea . Other versions of this story say this happened in the 19th century, or that the Chilean flag was placed second after the French flag; there are even variations that talk about Chile&#x27;s national anthem, placing it either in the first place or second, after La Marseillaise. The fact that the only documented version of this story gets basic details wrong (Belgium has a coast on the North Sea, not the Baltic Sea) does not reflect well on its historical accuracy.

==Similar flags==
The flag of the U.S. state of Texas is similar to the Chilean flag. The flag of Texas was designed and adopted on 25 January 1839; whereas Chile adopted a flag similar to today&#x27;s Chilean flag 22 years earlier on 18 October 1817. Nearly two decades before the then-national flag was approved by the Texas Congress and President Mirabeau B. Lamar. Texas&#x27; current flag is not a copied version of the Chilean flag, contrary to popular belief. 

Like Texas, on 17 January 1840; a coalition of nobles from the Mexican states of Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas advocated secession from Mexico to form their own federal republic called the Republic of the Rio Grande with Laredo (today part of Texas) as the capital but unlike Texas, was never formally recognized and ended on 6 November of the same year. Its flag was similar to that of Texas&#x27; in that there were three stars with a red hoist, and black and white bars on the side instead of one star with a blue hoist and white and red bars.

In 1822 during the Peruvian War of Independence, troops from both the Liberating Expedition of Peru (&quot;Expedición Libertadora del Perú&quot;) and the United Liberating Army of Peru (&quot;Ejército Unido Libertador del Perú&quot;) used a standard that was identical to the modern flag of Chile, except their flag had three stars in the canton (mostly forming the Triangulum Australe constellation), representing the three nations united by the cause of independence: the Argentine provinces, Chile and Peru.

On the other hand, the Chilean flag would have served as inspiration for the supporters of Cuban independence at the start the Ten Years&#x27; War in the so-called War Cry of Yara (Spanish: &quot;Grito de Yara&quot;) in 1868. The leader of this revolution, Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, would have been inspired to create the first Cuban flag named &quot;La Demajagua&quot; in honor of the place where the revolt began. Two main differences are that the red and blue colors are inverted and that the red canton extends to the middle of the fly instead of one-third as on the Chilean flag.

Céspedes would have been inspired by the Chilean flag as a way of honoring the efforts of Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna on behalf of Chile to achieve independence of Cuba after the Spanish defeat in the Chincha Islands War. According to Cespedes&#x27;s son, his father &quot;imagined a new flag that bore the same colors as that of the Carreras and O&#x27;Higgins and that would differentiate itself from the disposition of those colors.&quot; However, the flag would not have much success, and an earlier design would become the definitive Cuban flag.

The flag of Liberia, founded in 1847, also includes a single star on the canton, but it has multiple horizontal stripes similar to the United States Flag.

Also, the Flag of Malacca, a state in Malaysia, is similar, having the same colors (except the yellow star and moon) and a similar canton design, although the proportions and color order are different.

The state of Amazonas in Brazil also adopted a similar flag in 1982. Its flag also has an elongated blue canton with multiple stars.

The Catamarca province in Argentina adopted a flag in 2011 that has nearly the same color design, but the blue is paler, and with a yellow border and a sun with two olive branches in the center.

==Construction==
The construction of the flag of Chile, at present, is officially defined in Supreme Decree No. 1,534 of the Ministry of the Interior, published in 1967, on the use of national emblems, which systematized and consolidated various laws and regulations on the subject. (Other laws include Law No. 2,597 of 11 January 1912, concerning the colors and proportions of the national flag, the presidential sash and rosette or cockade, and Supreme Decree No. 5805 of the Ministry of the Interior, published 26 August 1927, sets the size of the national flag for use in buildings and public offices.) According to the decree, the ratio between length and width of the flag is 3:2, being divided horizontally into two bands of equal size. While the lower section corresponds to the color red, the upper area is divided once in a blue square and a white rectangle whose lengths are in proportion 1:2, respectively. The star is located in the center of the blue canton and is constructed on a circle whose diameter is half the side of the canton.
==Color scheme==
The exact color shades are not defined by law, but they are listed as &quot;turqui blue&quot;, &quot;white&quot; and &quot;red&quot;. Approximations below:
==Display==
According to Chilean law, public use of the flag is allowed without prior authorization. Before October 2011 its use was prohibited, without the approval of the provincial governor. (An exception was made in 2010 during the bicentennial celebrations, where display of the flag was permitted during the whole month of September.) This rule, however, was rarely enforced, as the flag was widely used on street celebrations, stadiums or rallies, without penal consequences.

Public buildings and private residences are required to display the flag on Navy Day (21 May), National Day (18 September) and Army Day (19 September). If the flag is displayed incorrectly or not displayed at all during these days, the person responsible may be fined.

===On a pole===
According to the protocol concerned, the flag should be hoisted from the tip of a white mast, and if done in company with other flags different, they must be of equal or lesser size. The Chilean flag must be set to the left if the sum of the flags is an even number or the center if the sum is an odd number. The flag must also be the first to be lifted and lowered the last.

===Freely hanging===
The Chilean flag can be displayed hanging either vertically or horizontally from a building or wall. In both cases, the blue square should be to the viewer&#x27;s upper left.

==Respect due to the flag==
Article 22 of the 1980 Constitution of Chile states that all inhabitants of the Republic owe respect to Chile and to its national emblems. The national emblems of Chile are the national flag, the coat of arms of the Republic and the national anthem. Pursuant to article 6 of the State Security Act of Chile (Decreto No. 890 de 1975), it is a felony against the public order to publicly mistreat the flag, the coat of arms, the name of the motherland or the national anthem.

==Regional flags==

Chile is administratively divided into 16 regions in which the internal government corresponds to the intendant. Some regional governments have adopted their own insignias, though most lack relevance, being principally used for public, regional organizations. The only exception is the flag of the Magallanes and Antartica Chilena Region, which has been adopted as a symbol of identity Magellan by its inhabitants.

The regional flags can be found in the Access Hall of the National Congress of Chile in the city of Valparaíso. Many communes and cities also have their own flags.

==Pledge to the National Flag==
In memory of the brave heroes of the Battle of La Concepcion in 1882, on 9 July each year, the very day the final Chilean soldiers in La Concepcion died in defense of the Chilean nation, this &quot;Pledge to the Flag&quot; (&quot;Juramento de la Bandera&quot;) is recited at all installations and military bases of the Chilean Army and the two Chilean Air Force] educational schools, and on graduation parades of the Chilean Navy and Air Force across the nation in remembrance of this moment in Chilean history. If done for the Carabineros de Chile, it is on the service anniversary (27 April) and passing out parades of enlisted personnel. A similar pledge is done by servicemen of the Chilean Gendarmerie and the Investigations Police of Chile - in the latter the American hand over heart gesture has been executed to clearly diffenciate from its sister organizations.

English translation of the pledge - Armed Forces variant
&lt;poem&gt;I (name and rank) pledge, to God and this flag,
to serve my country with loyalty,
whether in sea, on land, (in the air,) or in anywhere else,
preparing thus, if needed, to sacrifice my life,
to fulfill my military duties and obligations,
in accordance with the laws and regulations in force,
to obey quickly and punctually the orders of my superior officers,
and thus invest my efforts in being a brave and honorable soldier (sailor, airman)
no matter what, for my country&#x27;s sake!&lt;/poem&gt;

English translation of the pledge - Carabineros variant
&lt;poem&gt;I pledge, as a constable/second lieutenant, to God and this very flag,
To serve loyally the duties of my profession,
To preserve the Constitution and laws of the republic,
And to serve and protect all citizens and the people who live in this land
Even if it needs for me to sacrifice my life
For the defense of order and the country!&lt;/poem&gt;

English translation of the pledge - Gendarmerie variant
&lt;poem&gt;I (name and rank), pledge before the flag of my country,
to obey and comply with the laws and regulations concerning the Gendarmenie,
to serve loyally with the demands of this institution.

I pledge, towards my superiors, comrades and those of other organizations
to be a good example with punctually
as I serve the duties of this service even needed to do at the cost of my own life!&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="78297" wikidata="Q165883" url="?curid=78297" title="Louis VI of France">
<text>Louis VI (1 December 1081 – 1 August 1137), called the Fat () or the Fighter (), was King of the Franks from 1108 to 1137. Like his father Philip I, Louis made a lasting contribution to centralizing the institutions of royal power. He spent much of his twenty-nine-year reign fighting either the &quot;robber barons&quot; who plagued the Ile de France or Henry I of England for his continental possession of Normandy. Nonetheless, Louis VI managed to reinforce his power considerably, often resorting to force to bring lawless knights to justice, and was the first member of the house of Capet to issue ordonnances applying to the whole of the kingdom of France.

Louis was a warrior-king, but by his forties his weight had become so great that it was increasingly difficult for him to lead in the field (hence the epithet ). Details about his life and person are preserved in the , a panegyric composed by his loyal advisor, Suger, abbot of Saint Denis.

==Early life==

Louis was born around 1081 in Paris, the son of Philip I of France and Bertha of Holland.

Abbot Suger of Saint Denis, who wrote a biography of Louis VI, tells us: &quot;In his youth, growing courage matured his spirit with youthful vigour, making him bored with hunting and the boyish games with which others of his age used to enjoy themselves and forget the pursuit of arms.&quot; And &quot;How valiant he was in youth, and with what energy he repelled the king of the English, William Rufus, when he attacked Louis&#x27; inherited kingdom.&quot;

In 1098, Louis was knighted by Guy I of Ponthieu. On Christmas Day 1100 he attended the royal court of Henry I of England in London, where according to Symeon of Durham, Louis appeared as &quot;king elect of the Franks&quot;. By 1103 his father Philip I had already associated him with the government of the kingdom.

Louis married Lucienne de Rochefort, the daughter of his father&#x27;s seneschal, in 1104, but repudiated her three years later. They had no children. On 3 August 1115 Louis married Adelaide of Maurienne, daughter of Humbert II of Savoy and of Gisela of Burgundy, and niece of Pope Callixtus II. They had eight children. Adelaide was one of the most politically active of all France&#x27;s medieval queens. Her name appears on 45 royal charters from the reign of Louis VI. During her time as queen (1115–1137), royal charters were dated with both her regnal year and that of the king.

Suger became Louis&#x27;s adviser even before he succeeded his father as king at the age of 26 on 29 July 1108. Louis&#x27;s half-brother prevented him from reaching Rheims, and so Daimbert, Archbishop of Sens, crowned him in the cathedral of Orléans on 3 August. (Ralph the Green), Archbishop of Rheims, sent envoys to challenge the validity of the coronation and anointing, but to no avail.

==Challenges to royal authority==

When Louis ascended the throne, the Kingdom of France was a collection of feudal principalities. Beyond the Isle de France the French kings had limited authority over the great duke and counts of the realm but slowly Louis began to change this and assert Capetian power. This process would take two centuries to complete but began in the reign of Louis VI and his father Philip I.

The second great challenge facing Louis was to counter the rising power of the Anglo-Normans under their capable new king, Henry I of England.

==Struggles with the robber barons==
From early in his reign (and during his father&#x27;s reign) Louis faced the problem of the robber barons who resisted the King&#x27;s authority and engaged in brigandry, making the area around Paris unsafe. The castles of these robber barons, such as Le Puiset, Châteaufort, and Montlhéry, these barons would charge tolls, waylay merchants and pilgrims, terrorize the peasantry and loot churches and abbeys, the latter deeds drawing the ire of the writers of the day, who were mostly clerics.

In 1108, soon after he ascended the throne, Louis engaged in war with Hugh of Crécy, who was plaguing the countryside and had captured Eudes, Count of Corbeil, and imprisoned him at La Ferté-Alais. Louis besieged that fortress to free Eudes.

Also in 1108, a seigneur named Aymon Vaire-Vache seized the lordship of Bourbon from his nephew, Archambaud, a minor. Louis demanded the boy be restored to his rights but Aymon refused the summons. Louis raised his army and besieged Aymon at his castle at Germigny-l&#x27;Exempt, forcing its surrender.

In early 1109, Louis besieged his half-brother, Philip, the son of Bertrade de Montfort, who was involved in brigandry and conspiracies against the King, at Mantes-la-Jolie. Philip&#x27;s plots included the lords of Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury. Amaury III de Montfort held many castles which, when linked together, formed a continuous barrier between Louis and vast swathes of his domains, threatening all communication south of Paris.

In 1121, Louis established the &quot;marchands de l&#x27;eau,&quot; to regulate trade along the Seine.

In 1122, Aimeri, Bishop of Clermont, appealed to Louis after William VI, Count of Auvergne, had driven him from his episcopal town. When William refused Louis&#x27; summons, Louis raised an army at Bourges, and marched into Auvergne, supported by some of his leading vassals, such as the Counts of Anjou, Brittany, and Nevers. Louis seized the fortress of Pont-du-Chateau on the Allier, then attacked Clermont, which William was forced to abandon. Aimeri was restored. Four years later William rebelled again and Louis, though his increasing weight made campaigning difficult, marched again. He burned Montferrand and seized Clermont a second time, captured William, and brought him before the court at Orléans to answer for his crimes.

Some of the outlaws became notorious for their cruelty, the most notable being Thomas, Lord of Coucy, who was reputed to indulge in torture of his victims, including hanging men by their testicles, cutting out eyes, and chopping off feet. Guibert of Nogent noted of him, &quot;No one can imagine the number of those who perished in his dungeons, from starvation, from torture, from filth.&quot;

Another notable brigand was Hugh, Lord of Le Puiset, who was ravaging the lands around Chartres. In March 1111, Louis heard charges against Hugh at his court at Melun from Theobald II, Count of Champagne, the Archbishop of Sens, and also from bishops and abbots. Louis commanded Hugh to appear before him to answer these charges, but Hugh evaded the summons. Louis stripped him of his lands and titles and laid siege to Le Puiset. After a fierce struggle, Louis took the castle and burned it to the ground, taking Hugh prisoner.
Rashly, Louis released Hugh, and while Louis was engaged in war with Henry I of England and Theobald, Hugh raised another band of brigands and began ravaging the country again. When Louis returned his attention to Hugh, he found Le Puiset rebuilt and Hugh receiving aid from Theobald. Hugh held out against the King until Theobald abandoned him. Once again Louis razed Le Puiset and Hugh, who had sworn never to return to his brigandage, rebuilt the castle and resumed terrorizing his neighbours. At the third attempt, Louis finally defeated Hugh and stripped him of his possessions for the last time. Hugh later died on an expiatory pilgrimage to the Holy Land.

These were just some of the recalcitrant nobles Louis contended with. There were many more, and Louis was in constant motion against them, leading his army from castle to castle, bringing law and order to his domains. The result was increased recognition of the King&#x27;s authority and the Crown&#x27;s ability to impose its will, so that all sectors of French society began to see the King as their protector.

==War with Henry I over Gisors==
After seizing the English Crown, Henry I of England deprived his brother, Robert Curthose, of the Duchy of Normandy and quickly took possession of the castle at Gisors, a fortress of strategic importance on the
right bank of the Epte, commanding the road between Rouen and Paris. This violated an earlier agreement between
Henry and the French King that Gisors should remain in the hands of a neutral castellan, or else be demolished.

This move threatened the Capetian domain and Louis was outraged, demanding Henry, as his vassal, appear
before him to account for his actions. The two kings met, in force, in March 1109 at the borders of their respective
territories at the bridge of Neauphle on the Epte. Henry refused to relinquish Gisors. Louis challenged the English
King to single combat to settle the issue. When Henry refused, war was inevitable, a war which would last, on and off, for twenty years.

The first years of the war went well for Louis until the influential Theobald II, Count of Champagne, switched to Henry&#x27;s side. By early 1112 Theobald had succeeded in bringing together a coalition of barons
with grievances against Louis: Lancelin of Bulles, Ralph of Beaugency, Milo of Bray-sur-Seine, Hugh of Crecy, Guy of Rochfort, Hugh of Le Puiset and Hugh, Count of Troyes.

In response Louis formed an alliance with Fulk V of Anjou and several Norman lords, including Amaury III de Montfort, Guillaume Crinspin and Robert of Bellême. Louis defeated Theobald&#x27;s coalition but the additional effort meant he could not defeat the English monarch as well or force him to abandon Gisors, and in March 1113 Louis was forced to sign a treaty recognizing Henry I as suzerain of Brittany and Maine. Peace of sorts lasted three years until April 1116 when hostilities renewed in the French and Norman Vexins, with each king making gains from his rival.

By 1119, buoyed by several successes and the capture (through treachery) of Les Andelys, Louis felt ready for a final
encounter to end the war. In the fierce Battle of Bremule, in August 1119, Louis&#x27;s troops
broke and were routed, abandoning the royal banner and sweeping the King along with them in retreat to Les Andelys. A
counterattack through Évreux to seize Breteuil failed, and Louis, his health failing, looked for peace.

He appealed to Pope Calixtus II, who agreed to help and met with Henry at Gisors in November 1120. The terms of the
peace included Henry&#x27;s heir, William Adelin, doing homage to Louis for Normandy, a return of all territories captured
by both kings with the painful exception of Gisors itself, which Louis was forced to concede to Henry.

==Intervention in Flanders==

On 2 March 1127, the count of Flanders, Charles the Good, was assassinated in St. Donatian&#x27;s Cathedral at Bruges. It was a scandal in itself but made worse because it precipitated a succession crisis. Soon a number of relatives raised claims, including William of Ypres, popularly thought to be complicit in the murder; Thierry of Alsace; and Arnold of Denmark, nephew of Charles who seized Saint-Omer; Baldwin, Count of Hainault, who seized Oudenarde, and Godfrey I, Count of Louvain and Duke of Brabant.

Louis then moved decisively to secure Flanders, apprehending the murderers of Charles the Good and ousting the rival claimants. On 2 April he took Ghent, on 5 April Bruges, on 26 April he took Ypres, capturing William of Ypres and imprisoning him at Lille. He then quickly took Aire, Cassel and all the towns still loyal to William of Ypres. Louis&#x27;s final act before leaving for France was to witness the execution of Charles the Good&#x27;s murderers. They were hurled from the roof of the church of Saint Donatian where they had committed their crime.

Louis had his own candidate in mind and marched into Flanders with an army and urged the barons to elect William Clito, son of Robert Curthose, who had been disinherited of Normandy by his uncle Henry I of England, as their new Count. He had no better claim to Flanders than being the King&#x27;s candidate but on 23 March 1127 he was elected Count by the Flemings. It was a triumph for Louis and demonstrated how far the Crown had come under his leadership, but it was a brief triumph. The new young Count fared badly, opposition was growing in the towns as a result of Clito&#x27;s increasingly incompetent treatment of Flemish burghers. William&#x27;s knights ran amok and the Flemings rebelled against Louis&#x27;s candidate. Ghent and Bruge appealed to Thierry, Count of Flanders to Arnold of Denmark. Louis attempted to intervene again but the moment was gone. The people of Bruge rejected him and recognized Thierry of Alsace as their Count, and he quickly moved to enforce his claim. Louis called a great assembly at Arras, whereby the archbishop of Reims excommunicated Thierry and laid an interdict over the city of Lille. Louis abandoned William of Clito, who died during a siege at Alost on 27 July 1128, and after the whole country finally submitted to Thierry, Louis was obliged to confirm his claim.

==Invasion of Henry V==
On 25 November 1120, Louis&#x27; fortunes against Henry I of England were raised when Henry&#x27;s heir, William Ætheling, drunkenly perished aboard the &quot;White Ship&quot; en route from Normandy to England, putting the future of Henry&#x27;s dynasty and his position in doubt.

By 1123 Louis was involved with a coalition of Norman and French seigneurs opposed to Henry. The plan was to drive the English King from Normandy and replace him with William Clito. Henry, however, easily defeated this coalition then instigated his son-in-law, Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, to invade France.

Henry V had married the Empress Matilda, the English King&#x27;s daughter and the future mother of Henry II of England, 9 years earlier, in hopes of creating an Anglo-German empire, though the couple remained childless. Like Louis, Henry V had designs on the Low Countries and an invasion of Northern France would enable him to strengthen his ambitions in Flanders, as well as support his father-in-law.

Thus in 1124, Henry V assembled an army to march on Rheims. It never arrived. In testament to how far Louis had risen as national protector, all of France rose to his appeal against the threat. Henry V was unwilling to see the French barons united behind their King, who now identified himself as the vassal of St. Denis, the patron saint of Paris, whose banner he now carried and the proposed invasion was abandoned.

Henry V died a year after the aborted campaign.

==Alliance of the Anglo-Normans and Anjou==

In 1128 Henry I married his sole surviving legitimate child, the dowager Empress Matilda, to Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou. This would prove to be a dangerous alliance for the French monarchy during the reign of his successor, Louis VII of France.

==Final years==

As Louis VI approached his end, there seemed to be reasons for optimism. Henry I of England had died on 1 December 1135 and Stephen of Blois had seized the English crown, reneging on the oath he had sworn to Henry I to support Matilda. Stephen was thus in no position to bring the combined Anglo-Norman might against the French crown.

Louis had also made great strides in exercising his royal authority over his barons, and even Theobald II had finally rallied to the Capetian cause.

Finally, on 9 April 1137, a dying William X, Duke of Aquitaine appointed Louis VI guardian of his fifteen-year-old daughter and heiress, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Eleanor was suddenly the most eligible heiress in Europe, and Louis wasted no time in marrying her to his own heir, the future Louis VII, at the Cathedral of Saint-André in Bordeaux on 25 July 1137. At a stroke Louis had added one of the most powerful duchies in France to the Capetian domains.

Louis died of dysentery 7 days later, on 1 August 1137. Despite his achievements, it would be the growing power of the soon to be Angevin Empire that would come to overshadow his successor, its seeds sown in the marriage between the Empress Matilda and Geoffrey Plantagenet and realised through their son, Henry II of England.

Louis VI was interred in the Basilica of St Denis in Paris.

==Marriages and children==

He married in 1104: 1) Lucienne de Rochefort — the marriage was annulled on 23 May 1107 at the Council of Troyes by Pope Paschal II.

Louis married in 1115: 2) Adélaide de Maurienne (1092–1154)

<text>Carleton Stevens Coon (June 23, 1904 – June 3, 1981) was an American anthropologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He is best known for his scientific racist theories concerning the parallel evolution of human races, which were widely disputed in his lifetime and are considered pseudoscientific by modern science.

Born in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Coon became interested in anthropology after attending Earnest Hooton&#x27;s lectures at Harvard University. He obtained his PhD in 1928 based on an ethnographic study of the Rif Berbers of Morocco. Returning to Harvard as a lecturer, he conducted further fieldwork in the Balkans, North Africa, and the Middle East. In 1948 he was appointed a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania and remained there until his retirement in 1963, also serving as the Curator of Ethnology at the Penn Museum. During the Second World War, he was an agent for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), where he used his anthropological fieldwork as a cover for an arms-smuggling operation in German-occupied Morocco. He was awarded the Legion of Merit and after the war he retained ties to the military and the OSS&#x27; successor the Central Intelligence Agency. He wrote about his wartime experiences in his book, &quot;A North Africa Story: The Anthropologist as OSS Agent&quot; (1980).

Coon&#x27;s early work in physical anthropology, such as &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1939), was typical of its time. He described the different racial &#x27;types&#x27; supposedly present in human populations, but rejected a specific definition of &#x27;race&#x27; and made no attempt to explain how these types arose. This changed after 1950, as Coon attempted to defend an essentialist concept of race against the new physical anthropology of contemporaries such as Sherwood Washburn and Ashley Montagu, who argued that the emerging understanding of human genetics negated race as a scientific category. In &quot;The Origins of Races&quot; (1962), Coon set forth his theory that there were five distinct subspecies of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; that evolved in parallel in different parts of the world, and that some had evolved further than others. The book was widely castigated upon its publication and marked a decisive break between Coon and the scientific mainstream. He resigned the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in 1961, after it voted to condemn a white supremacist book written by Coon&#x27;s cousin Carleton Putnam. Though Coon continued to defend his theories until his death and rejected the accusations that he was a racist, they were quickly excluded from the scientific consensus as &quot;outmoded [...], typological and racist&quot;.

Aside from physical anthropology, Coon conducted a series of archaeological excavations of Stone Age cave sites in Iran, Afghanistan and Syria. These included Bisitun Cave, where he discovered traces of the Neanderthals, and Hotu cave, which he claimed showed evidence of early agriculture, though subsequent excavations proved this false. He was also a lifelong proponent of the existence of cryptid &#x27;Wild Men&#x27; such as the Sasquatch and Yeti, which he believed were relict populations of human-like apes that, when found, would support his theory of the separate origins of human races. He was involved in planning &#x27;Yeti-hunting&#x27; expeditions to Nepal and Tibet, though it has also been speculated that these were cover for espionage.

Coon was married twice, first to Mary Goodale and then to Lisa Dougherty Geddes. He had two sons, including Carleton S. Coon Jr., a diplomat who served as the American Ambassador to Nepal. He died in Gloucester, Massachusetts in 1981.

==Early life and education==
Carleton Stevens Coon was born in Wakefield, Massachusetts on June 23, 1904. His parents were John Lewis Coon, a cotton factor, and Bessie Carleton. His family had Cornish American roots and two of his ancestors fought in the American Civil War. As a child, he listened to his grandfather&#x27;s stories of the war and of traveling in the Middle East, and accompanied his father on business trips to Egypt, inspiring an early interest in Egyptology. He initially attended Wakefield High School, but was expelled after breaking a water pipe and flooding the school&#x27;s basement, after which he went to Phillips Academy. Coon was a precocious student, learning to read Egyptian hieroglyphs at an early age and excelling at Ancient Greek.

Wakefield was an affluent and almost exclusively white town. Coon&#x27;s biographer, William W. Howells, noted that his &quot;only apparent awareness of ethnicity&quot; was in childhood fights with his Irish American neighbours. Coon himself claimed that &quot;both anti-Semitism and racism were unknown to me before I left home at the age of fifteen, and zero to fifteen are formative years.&quot;

Intending to study Egyptology, Coon enrolled at Harvard University and was able to obtain a place on a graduate course with George Andrew Reisner based on his knowledge of hieroglyphic. He also studied Arabic and English composition under Charles Townsend Copeland. However he changed his focus to anthropology after taking a course with Earnest Hooton, inspired by his lectures on the Berbers of the Moroccan Rif. Coon obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Harvard in 1925 and immediately embarked on graduate studies in anthropology. He conducted his dissertation fieldwork in the Rif in 1925, which was politically unsettled after a rebellion of the local populace against the Spanish, and was awarded his PhD in 1928.

Coon was motivated to study the Rif by the puzzle of the &quot;light-skinned&quot; Riffians&#x27; presence in Africa. Throughout much of his fieldwork, he relied on his local informant Mohammed Limnibhy, and even arranged for Limnibhy to live with him in Cambridge from 1928 to 1929.

== Academic career ==
After obtaining his PhD, Coon returned to Harvard as a lecturer and later a professor. In 1931 he published his dissertation as the &quot;definitive monograph&quot; of the Rif Berber; studied Albanians from 1920 to 1930; traveled to Ethiopia in 1933; and in worked in Arabia, North Africa and the Balkans from 1925 to 1939.

Coon left Harvard to take up a position at the University of Pennsylvania in 1948. Throughout the 1950s he produced academic papers, as well as many popular books for the general reader, the most notable being &quot;The Story of Man&quot; (1954). During his years at Penn in the 1950s, he sometimes appeared on the television program called &quot;What in the World?&quot;, a game-show produced by the Penn Museum, and hosted by its director, Froelich Rainey, in which a panel of experts tried to identify an object in the museum&#x27;s collection.

He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his wartime services and the Viking Medal in Physical Anthropology in 1952. He was also named a Membre D&#x27;Honneur of the Association de la Libération française du 8 novembre 1942. From 1948 to the early 1960s, he was the Curator of Ethnology at the University Museum of Philadelphia.

== Military career ==

Coon wrote widely for a general audience like his mentor Earnest Hooton. Coon published &quot;The Riffians&quot;, &quot;Flesh of the Wild Ox&quot;, &quot;Measuring Ethiopia&quot;, and &quot;A North Africa Story: The Anthropologist as OSS Agent&quot;. &quot;A North Africa Story&quot; was an account of his work in North Africa during World War II, which involved espionage and the smuggling of arms to French resistance groups in German-occupied Morocco under the guise of anthropological fieldwork. During that time, Coon was affiliated with the United States Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency.

Coon served as a mentor to another Harvard-educated OSS agent and anthropologist who embraced anthropometry (measuring features of the human body, such as crania and nose sizes) as a means asserting racial types and categories. This was Lloyd Cabot Briggs, author of &quot;Living Races of the Sahara Desert&quot; (1958) and later of &quot;No More for Ever: A Saharan Jewish Town (1962)&quot; about the Jews of the Mzab region of the Algerian Sahara, which he wrote with Norina Lami Guède (née Maria Esterina Giovanni). The historian Sarah Abreyava Stein (who argued that Guede had done most of the research) noted that Briggs and Coon corresponded during the writing of &quot;No More for Ever&quot;, joking, for example, about the genital depilation customs of Jewish women in Ghardaïa.

After the war, Coon returned to Harvard, but retained ties to the OSS and its successor the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). He was a scientific consultant to the CIA from 1948 to 1950, and in 1945 wrote an influential paper that argued that the United States should continue the use of wartime intelligence agencies to maintain an &quot;Invisible Empire&quot; in the postwar period. In 1956–57, he worked for the Air Force as a photographer.

== Racial theories ==

Before World War II, Coon&#x27;s work on race &quot;fit comfortably into the old physical anthropology&quot;, describing the racial types supposedly present in human populations based on visible physical characteristics. He explicitly rejected any specific definition of race and used the concept to describe both highly specific groupings of people and continent-spanning racial types. In &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1939), for example, an update of William Z. Ripley&#x27;s 1899 book of the same title, he distinguished between at least four racial types and sub-types of Jewish people, but also maintained that there existed a single, primordial Jewish race, characterised by a Jewish nose and other physical features that together form &quot;a quality of looking Jewish&quot;. In these early works Coon alluded to essential, &quot;pure&quot; racial types that produced the specific races he observed through hybridization, but did not attempt to explain how or where these types arose.

The immediate post-war period marked a decisive break in Coon&#x27;s work on race as the conventional, typological approach was challenged by the &quot;new physical anthropology&quot;. Led by Coon&#x27;s former classmate Sherwood Washburn, this was a movement to shift the field away from description and classification and towards an understanding of human variability grounded in the modern synthesis of biological evolution and population genetics. For some anthropologists, including Ashley Montagu and later Washburn himself, the new physical anthropology necessitated the wholesale rejection of race as a scientific category. In contrast, in &quot;Races: A Study in the Problem of Race Formation in Man&quot; (1950), Coon, together with his former student Stanley Garn and Joseph Birdsell, attempted to reconcile the race concept with the new physical anthropology&#x27;s emphasis on genetics and adaptation. This was followed by Coon&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; (1962), which put forward a theory of the origins of essential racial types, however distinct from what is described by the model of multiregional evolution (MRE) as it drastically understates the role played by gene flow (whereas MRE requires it).

Coon concluded that sometimes different racial types annihilated other types, while in other instances warfare and/or settlement led to the partial displacement of racial types. He asserted that Europe was the refined product of a long history of racial progression. He also posited that historically &quot;different strains in one population have showed differential survival values and often one has reemerged at the expense of others (in Europeans)&quot;, in &quot;The Races of Europe, The White Race and the New World&quot; (1939). Coon suggested that the &quot;maximum survival&quot; of the European racial type was increased by the replacement of the indigenous peoples of the New World. He stated the history of the White race to have involved &quot;racial survivals&quot; of White subraces.

===Racial origins===

Coon first modified Franz Weidenreich&#x27;s polycentric (or multiregional) theory of the origin of races. The Weidenreich Theory states that human races have evolved independently in the Old World from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens sapiens, while at the same time there was gene flow between the various populations. Coon held a similar belief that modern humans, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, arose separately in five different places from Homo erectus, &quot;as each subspecies, living in its own territory, passed a critical threshold from a more brutal to a more &quot;sapient&quot; state&quot;, but unlike Weidenreich stressed gene flow far less. Coon&#x27;s modified form of the Weidenreich Theory is referred to as the Candelabra Hypothesis (parallel evolution or polygenism) that minimizes gene flow.

In his 1962 book, &quot;The Origin of Races&quot;, Coon theorized that some races reached the Homo sapiens stage in evolution before others, resulting in the higher degree of civilization among some races. He had continued his theory of five races. He considered both what he called the Mongoloid race and the Caucasoid race had individuals who had adapted to crowding through evolution of the endocrine system, which made them more successful in the modern world of civilization. This can be found after page 370, in the illustrative serie of number XXXII of The Origin of Races. Coon contrasted a picture of an Indigenous Australian with one of a Chinese professor. His caption &quot;The Alpha and the Omega&quot; was used to demonstrate his research that brain size was positively correlated with intelligence.

By this he meant that the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races had evolved more in their separate areas after they had left Africa in a primitive form. He also believed, &quot;The earliest Homo sapiens known, as represented by several examples from Europe and Africa, was an ancestral long-headed white man of short stature and moderately great brain size.&quot;

===Races in the Indian sub-continent===
Coon&#x27;s understanding of racial typology and diversity within the Indian sub-continent changed over time. In &quot;The Races of Europe&quot;, he regarded the so-called &quot;Veddoids&quot; of India (&quot;tribal&quot; Indians, or &quot;Adivasi&quot;) as closely related to other peoples in the South-Pacific (&quot;Australoids&quot;), and he also believed that this supposed human lineage (the &quot;Australoids&quot;) was an important genetic substratum in Southern India. As for the north of the sub-continent, it was an extension of the Caucasoid range. By the time Coon coauthored &quot;The Living Races of Man&quot;, he thought that India&#x27;s Adivasis were an ancient Caucasoid-Australoid mix who tended to be more Caucasoid than Australoid (with great variability), that the Dravidian peoples of Southern India were simply Caucasoid, and that the north of the sub-continent was also Caucasoid. In short, the Indian sub-continent (North and South) is &quot;the easternmost outpost of the Caucasoid racial region&quot;. Underlying all of this was Coon&#x27;s typological view of human history and biological variation, a way of thinking that is not taken seriously today by most anthropologists/biologists.

== Debate on race ==

The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s and changing social attitudes challenged racial theories like Coon&#x27;s that had been used by segregationists to justify discrimination and depriving people of civil rights. In 1961, Coon&#x27;s cousin Carleton Putnam, wrote &quot;Race and Reason: A Yankee View&quot;, arguing a scientific basis for white supremacy and the continuation of racial segregation in the United States. After the book was made required reading for high school students in Louisiana, the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (AAPA) passed a resolution condemning it. Coon, who had corresponded with Putnam about the book as he was writing it, and chaired the meeting of the AAPA in which the resolution was passed, resigned in protest, criticizing the resolution as scientifically irresponsible and a violation of free speech. Later, he claimed to have asked how many of those present at the meeting had read the book, and that only one hand was raised.

Coon published &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; in 1962. In its &quot;Introduction&quot;, he described the book as part of the outcome of his project he conceived (in light of his work on &quot;The Races of Europe&quot;) around the end of 1956, for a work to be titled along the lines of &quot;Races of the World&quot;. He said that since 1959 he had proceeded with the intention to follow &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; with a sequel, so the two would jointly fulfill the goals of the original project. (He indeed published &quot;The Living Races of Man&quot; in 1965.) The book asserted that the human species divided into five races before it had evolved into &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Further, he suggested that the races evolved into &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; at different times. It was not well received. The field of anthropology was moving rapidly from theories of race typology, and &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; was widely castigated by his peers in anthropology as supporting racist ideas with outmoded theory and notions which had long since been repudiated by modern science. One of his harshest critics, Theodore Dobzhansky, scorned it as providing &quot;grist for racist mills&quot;.

The dispute that followed the publication of &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; was personal as well as academic. Coon had known Ashley Montagu and Dobzhansky for decades and the three men often corresponded and wrote positive reviews of each other&#x27;s work before 1962. Their vociferous criticism of &quot;Origins&quot; severed their friendship and affected Coon on a personal and emotional level. In a letter to Dobzhansky shortly after its publication, Coon advised him that he considered his critiques defamatory and had consulted a lawyer, writing: &quot;Why have you done this? When are you going to stop?&quot; Washburn was a fellow student of Earnest Hooton at Harvard, and Coon saw his subsequent repudiation of biological race as an &quot;oedipal&quot; betrayal of their mentor. Garn, Coon&#x27;s former student and coauthor of &quot;Races&quot;, helped draft the AAPA motion condemning Putnam, which also disappointed Coon. Coon stopped referencing Montagu and then Washburn in his work after they each publicly rejected the concept of race. Nevertheless, historian Peter Sachs Collopy has noted that Coon was able to maintain cordial relationships with many of those he had disagreements with, rooted in his belief in the importance of academic collegiality.

Although some of these interpersonal conflicts faded over time—Coon wrote that he had &quot;buried the now-rusty hatchet&quot; with Dobzhansky in a letter to him in 1975—the animosity between Coon and Montagu was severe and lasting. Before 1962, the two were on friendly terms, but represented rival schools of anthropology (Coon studied under Hooton at Harvard; Montagu under Boas at Columbia), and Coon privately disdained his work. After the publication of &quot;Origins&quot;, they engaged in a lengthy correspondence, published in &quot;Current Anthropology&quot;, that &quot;consisted almost entirely of bickering over minutiae, name calling, and sarcasm&quot;. Privately, Coon suspected Montagu (a target of McCarthyism) of communist sympathies and of turning Dobzhansky and others against him. As late as 1977, he was quoted as saying to a colleague, &quot;You had Ashley Montagu in your office? And you didn&#x27;t shoot him?&quot; The enmity was reciprocated; in a 1974 letter to Stephen Jay Gould, Montagu wrote, &quot;Coon… is a racist and an antisemite, as I know well, so when you describe Coon&#x27;s letter to the editor of &quot;Natural History&quot; as &#x27;amusing&#x27; I understand exactly what you mean—but it is so in exactly the same sense as &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; was &#x27;amusing&#x27;.&quot;

Coon continued to write and defend his work until his death, publishing two volumes of memoirs in 1980 and 1981.

== Other work ==

=== Archaeology ===

After taking up his position at Pennsylvania in 1948, Coon embarked on a series of archaeological expeditions to Iran, Afghanistan and Syria. His 1949 excavations at four cave sites in Iran (Bisitun, Tamtama, Khunik and Belt) were the first systematic investigations of Palaeolithic archaeology in Iran. The most significant of these was Bisitun, which Coon called &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Cave&quot;, where he discovered evidence of the Mousterian industry and several human fossils that were later confirmed to belong to Neanderthals. Coon published the results of these excavations in a 1951 monograph, &quot;Cave Explorations in Iran, 1949&quot;, and subsequently wrote a popular book about the expeditions, &quot;The Seven Caves: Archaeological Explorations in the Middle East&quot; (1957). Bisitun remained the only fully-published Palaeolithic site from Iran for several decades.

Coon followed up his 1949 expedition with excavations at Hotu Cave in 1951. He interpreted the site, together with Belt Cave, as the first traces of a &quot;Mesolithic&quot; in Iran and claimed that they showed evidence of early agriculture. Other archaeologists questioned the basis for these claims and subsequent excavations at sites such as Ganj Dareh clarified that Coon had probably conflated separate Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherer and Neolithic farmer occupations at the sites.

===Cryptozoology===

Coon was, up to his death, a proponent of the existence of bipedal cryptids, including Sasquatch and Yeti. His 1954 book &quot;The Story of Man&quot; included a chapter on &quot;Giant Apes and Snowmen&quot; and a figure showing the purported footprints of an &quot;Abominable Snowman&quot; alongside those of extinct hominids, and near the end of his life he wrote a paper on &quot;Why There Has to Be a Sasquatch&quot;. In the late 1950s, he was approached by &quot;Life&quot; magazine about either joining Tom Slick and Peter Byrne&#x27;s expedition to the Himalayas to search for evidence of Yeti, or organising his own expedition. Although Coon spent some time planning the logistics, in the end neither materialised. Coon believed that cryptid &quot;Wild Men&quot; were relict populations of Pleistocene apes and that, if their existence could be proved scientifically, they would lend support to his theory of the separate origins of human races.

Cultural historian Colin Dickey has argued that the search for Sasquatch and Yeti are inextricably linked to racism: &quot;For an anthropologist like Coon, invested in finding some sort of scientific basis to justify his racism, Wild Men lore offered a compelling narrative, a chance to prove a scientific basis for his white supremacy.&quot; It has also been speculated that the Yeti expeditions that Coon was involved with were cover for American espionage in Nepal and Tibet, since both he and Slick had links to US intelligence agencies, and Byrne was allegedly involved in the extraction of the 14th Dalai Lama from Tibet by the CIA in 1959.

Coon&#x27;s views on cryptids were a major influence on Grover Krantz, and the two were close friends in his later life.

==Reception and legacy==
Coon&#x27;s published magnum opus, &quot;The Origin of Races&quot; (1962), received mixed reactions from scientists of the era. Ernst Mayr praised the work for its synthesis as having an &quot;invigorating freshness that will reinforce the current revitalization of physical anthropology&quot;. A book review by Stanley Marion Garn criticised Coon&#x27;s parallel view of the origin of the races with little gene flow but praised the work for its racial taxonomy and concluded: &quot;an overall favorable report on the now famous Origin of Races&quot;. Sherwood Washburn and Ashley Montagu were heavily influenced by the modern synthesis in biology and population genetics. In addition, they were influenced by Franz Boas, who had moved away from typological racial thinking. Rather than supporting Coon&#x27;s theories, they and other contemporary researchers viewed the human species as a continuous serial progression of populations and heavily criticized Coon&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Races&quot;.

In a New York Times&#x27; obituary he was hailed for &quot;important contributions to most of the major subdivisions of modern anthropology&quot;, &quot;pioneering contributions to the study of human transition from the hunter-gatherer culture to the first agricultural communities.&quot; and &quot;important early work in studying the physical adaptations of humans in such extreme environments as deserts, the Arctic and high altitudes.&quot; William W. Howells, writing in a 1989 article, noted that Coon&#x27;s research was &quot;still regarded as a valuable source of data&quot;. In 2001, John P. Jackson, Jr. researched Coon&#x27;s papers to review the controversy around the reception of &quot;The Origin of Races&quot;, stating in the article abstract:

Jackson found in the archived Coon papers records of repeated efforts by Coon to aid Putnam&#x27;s efforts to provide intellectual support to the ongoing resistance to racial integration, but cautioned Putnam against statements that could identify Coon as an active ally (Jackson also noted that both men had become aware that they had General Israel Putnam as a common ancestor, making them (at least distant) cousins, but Jackson indicated neither when either learned of the family relationship nor whether they had a more recent common ancestor). Alan H. Goodman (2000) has said that Coon&#x27;s main legacy was not his &quot;separate evolution of races (Coon 1962),&quot; but his &quot;molding of race into the new physical anthropology of adaptive and evolutionary processes (Coon et al. 1950),&quot; since he attempted to &quot;unify a typological model of human variation with an evolutionary perspective and explained racial differences with adaptivist arguments.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Coon married Mary Goodale in 1926. They had two sons, one of whom, Carleton S. Coon Jr. went on to become Ambassador to Nepal. Coon and Goodale divorced and in 1945 he married Lisa Dougherty Geddes. He was a member of the Congregational Church.

Coon retired from Pennsylvania in 1963, but retained an affiliation with the Peabody Museum and continued to write until the end of his life. He appeared on several episodes of television quiz show &quot;What in the World?&quot; between 1952 and 1957.

Coon died in Gloucester, Massachusetts on June 3, 1981.

<text>In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the physical layer or layer 1 is the first and lowest layer: the layer most closely associated with the physical connection between devices. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and procedural interface to the transmission medium. The shapes and properties of the electrical connectors, the frequencies to transmit on, the line code to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified by the physical layer.

At the electrical layer, the physical layer is commonly implemented by dedicated PHY chip or, in electronic design automation (EDA), by a design block. In mobile computing, the MIPI Alliance *-PHY family of interconnect protocols are widely used. 

Historically, the OSI model is closely associated with internetworking, such as the Internet protocol suite and Ethernet, which were developed in the same era, along similar lines, though with somewhat different abstractions. Beyond internetworking, the OSI abstraction can be brought to bear on all forms of device interconnection in data communications and computational electronics.

== Role ==
The physical layer defines the means of transmitting a stream of raw bits over a physical data link connecting network nodes. The bitstream may be grouped into code words or symbols and converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a transmission medium. 

The physical layer consists of the electronic circuit transmission technologies of a network. It is a fundamental layer underlying the higher level functions in a network, and can be implemented through a great number of different hardware technologies with widely varying characteristics.

Within the semantics of the OSI model, the physical layer translates logical communications requests from the data link layer into hardware-specific operations to cause transmission or reception of electronic (or other) signals. The physical layer supports higher layers responsible for generation of logical data packets.

== Physical signaling sublayer ==
In a network using Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) architecture, the &quot;physical signaling sublayer&quot; is the portion of the physical layer that
* interfaces with the data link layer&#x27;s medium access control (MAC) sublayer,
* performs symbol encoding, transmission, reception and decoding and,
* performs galvanic isolation.

== Relation to the Internet protocol suite ==
The Internet protocol suite, as defined in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123, is a high-level networking description used for the Internet and similar networks. It does not define a layer that deals exclusively with hardware-level specifications and interfaces, as this model does not concern itself directly with physical interfaces.

== Services ==
The major functions and services performed by the physical layer are:
The physical layer performs bit-by-bit or symbol-by-symbol data delivery over a physical transmission medium. It provides a standardized interface to the transmission medium, including a mechanical specification of electrical connectors and cables, for example maximum cable length, an electrical specification of transmission line signal level and impedance. The physical layer is responsible for electromagnetic compatibility including electromagnetic spectrum frequency allocation and specification of signal strength, analog bandwidth, etc. The transmission medium may be electrical or optical over optical fiber or a wireless communication link such as free-space optical communication or radio.

Line coding is used to convert data into a pattern of electrical fluctuations which may be modulated onto a carrier wave or infrared light. The flow of data is managed with bit synchronization in synchronous serial communication or start-stop signalling and flow control in asynchronous serial communication. Sharing of the transmission medium among multiple network participants can be handled by simple circuit switching or multiplexing. More complex medium access control protocols for sharing the transmission medium may use carrier sense and collision detection such as in Ethernet&#x27;s Carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD).

To optimize reliability and efficiency, signal processing techniques such as equalization, training sequences and pulse shaping may be used. Error correction codes and techniques including forward error correction may be applied to further improve reliability.

Other topics associated with the physical layer include: bit rate; point-to-point, multipoint or point-to-multipoint line configuration; physical network topology, for example bus, ring, mesh or star network; serial or parallel communication; simplex, half duplex or full duplex transmission mode; and autonegotiation

== PHY ==

A PHY, an abbreviation for &quot;physical layer&quot;, is an electronic circuit, usually implemented as an integrated circuit, required to implement physical layer functions of the OSI model in a network interface controller.

A PHY connects a link layer device (often called MAC as an acronym for medium access control) to a physical medium such as an optical fiber or copper cable. A PHY device typically includes both physical coding sublayer (PCS) and physical medium dependent (PMD) layer functionality.

&quot;-PHY&quot; may also be used as a suffix to form a short name referencing a specific physical layer protocol, for example M-PHY. 

Modular transceivers for fiber-optic communication (like the SFP family) complement a PHY chip and form the PMD sublayer.

=== Ethernet physical transceiver ===
The Ethernet PHY is a component that operates at the physical layer of the OSI network model. It implements the physical layer portion of the Ethernet. Its purpose is to provide analog signal physical access to the link. It is usually interfaced with a media-independent interface (MII) to a MAC chip in a microcontroller or another system that takes care of the higher layer functions. 

More specifically, the Ethernet PHY is a chip that implements the hardware send and receive function of Ethernet frames; it interfaces between the analog domain of Ethernet&#x27;s line modulation and the digital domain of link-layer packet signaling. The PHY usually does not handle MAC addressing, as that is the link layer&#x27;s job. Similarly, Wake-on-LAN and Boot ROM functionality is implemented in the network interface card (NIC), which may have PHY, MAC, and other functionality integrated into one chip or as separate chips.

Common Ethernet interfaces include fiber or two to four copper pairs for data communication. However, there now exists a new interface, called Single Pair Ethernet (SPE), which is able to utilize a single pair of copper wires while still communicating at the intended speeds. Texas Instruments DP83TD510E is an example of a PHY which uses SPE.

Examples include the Microsemi SimpliPHY and SynchroPHY VSC82xx/84xx/85xx/86xx family, Marvell Alaska 88E1310/88E1310S/88E1318/88E1318S Gigabit Ethernet transceivers, Texas Instruments DP838xx family and offerings from Intel and ICS.

===Other applications===
* Wireless LAN or Wi-Fi: The PHY portion consists of the RF, mixed-signal and analog portions, that are often called transceivers, and the digital baseband portion that use digital signal processor (DSP) and communication algorithm processing, including channel codes. It is common that these PHY portions are integrated with the medium access control (MAC) layer in system-on-a-chip (SOC) implementations. Similar wireless applications include 3G/4G/LTE/5G, WiMAX and UWB.
* Universal Serial Bus (USB): A PHY chip is integrated into most USB controllers in hosts or embedded systems and provides the bridge between the digital and modulated parts of the interface.
* IrDA: The Infrared Data Association&#x27;s (IrDA) specification includes an IrPHY specification for the physical layer of the data transport.
* Serial ATA (SATA): Serial ATA controllers use a PHY.

<text>The national flag of Finland, also known in Finnish as the &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Blue Cross Flag&#x27;), dates from the beginning of the 20th century. On a white background, it features a blue Nordic cross, which represents Christianity.

The state flag has the Finnish coat of arms in the centre, but is otherwise identical to the civil flag. The swallow-tailed state flag is used by the military. The presidential standard is identical to the swallow-tailed state flag but also has in its upper-left corner the Cross of Liberty after the Order of the Cross of Liberty, which has the president of Finland as its grand master. Like in Sweden, Finland&#x27;s national flag is based on the Nordic cross. It was adopted after independence from the Russian Empire, when many patriotic Finns wanted a special flag for their country, but the flag&#x27;s design dates back to the 19th century. Blue is said to represent the country&#x27;s thousands of lakes and the sky and white the snow that covers the land in winter. The colour combination has also been used over the centuries in various Finnish provincial, military and town flags.

==History==
The first known &quot;Flag of Finland&quot; was presented in 1848, along with the unofficial national anthem &quot;&quot;. Its motif was the coat of arms of Finland surrounded by laurel leaves on a white flag.

The current blue-crossed design was first used in Finland by Nyländska Jaktklubben, a yacht club founded in Helsinki in 1861. In addition to the blue cross on the white background, the yacht club flag had the crowned arms of the province of Uusimaa within two crossed branches in the upper hoist quarter. Except for the position of the cross, the flag was similar to the flag of the St. Petersburg Yacht Club, which had been founded the previous year. The design can be traced to the Russian Navy&#x27;s ensign, which has a blue cross saltire on a white background. During the Crimean War, Finnish merchant ships that were captured by the British-French fleet flew a flag called &quot;Flag of St. George&quot;, which was based on the Russian Customs flag. This variant had the cross was thinner than in the modern flag, and the proportions were equal. Another flag with a blue cross was made official in 1861 for private vessels.

In 1910, in connection with Russification of Finland, the Russian authorities decreed for a Russian flag to be added to the canton. However, it was met with resistance and was derided as the &quot;slave&#x27;s flag&quot; (&quot;&quot;), and most Finns refused to fly it. Instead, a triangular pennant without this modification was flown, thereby circumventing the decree concerning flags.

Shortly after Finland declared its full independence in 1917, a competition was held for the design of the Finnish flag. Several different designs were submitted. Regarding the colours, the entries fell mainly into two categories: one using the red and yellow from the Finnish coat of arms and the other using the present blue and white colours.

One entry had the Dannebrog cross design but with a yellow cross on a red background. Another entry had diagonal blue and white stripes, but it was criticized[&quot;&quot;] as being more suitable for a barber shop than a newly independent country. Akseli Gallen-Kallela proposed a similar cross flag but with colours inverted (white cross on blue), but this was considered too similar to the Swedish flag and particularly the contemporary Greek flag. Finally, the artists Eero Snellman and Bruno Tuukkanen specified the final form of the flag. According to tradition, the flag was based on a design by the poet Zachris Topelius in about 1860.

The Finnish state flag was further modified in 1922, when the coronet was removed, and again in 1978, when the shield-shaped coat of arms was changed into a rectangular shape.

==Legal definition==
===Flag Construction===
===Size===
Under Finnish law, the ratio of the flag is 11:18 (height:width), very close to the golden ratio. The swallow-tailed state flag is one unit longer, and the tails are five units long. The cusp width of the blue cross is three units of measure, giving a ratio set of 4:3:4 (vertical) and 5:3:10 (horizontal). When flown from a flagpole, the flag is recommended to have a width equalling one-sixth of the height of the pole.

===Usage===

The Finnish flag is used in three main variants. The usual national flag is used by all citizens, organisations and Finnish municipalities and regions. Anyone is allowed to fly the national flag whenever it is deemed to be suitable. The rectangular state flag is used by bodies of the Finnish national and provincial governments, by the cathedral chapters of the two national churches (Evangelical Lutheran and Orthodox) and non-naval vessels of the state.

The swallow-tailed national flag, which is also the naval ensign, is flown by the Finnish Defence Forces. The presidential standard and the command signs of the minister of defence, chief of defence, and commander of the Finnish Navy are flown only by the respective persons.

All public bodies as well as most private citizens and corporations fly the flag on official flag flying days. In addition to the official flag flying days, there are about ten unofficial but generally observed flag flying days. Besides flag flying days, normally, no flags or corporate flags are flown. Flag Day is celebrated on Midsummer&#x27;s Day.

The Finnish flag is raised at 8 am and lowered at sunset, however not later than 9 pm. On Independence Day, the flag is flown until 8 pm, regardless of the dark. On the occasion of great national tragedies, the Ministry of The Interior may recommend flying the flag at half-mast throughout the country.

As a special custom in Finland, the flag is flown at Midsummer from 6 pm of Midsummer eve until 9 pm of Midsummer&#x27;s day. This is done to symbolize the fact that the darkness does not come to any part of Finland during Midsummer&#x27;s Night. Midsummer is also celebrated as the day of the Finnish flag.

=== Colours ===
The current standard colours were defined in 1995 in both CIE 1931 and CIE 1976 standards, with approximate equivalents in the Natural Colour System (Swedish standard ) and by the Pantone Color Matching System also given:


There is no official RGB version of the colours, and in fact the yellow as defined in the CIE L*a*b* standard lies outside colour gamut of the sRGB colour space. The CIE L*a*b* colours can be approximated in sRGB (range 0–255) by: blue R=24, G=68, B=126, red R=181, G=28, B=49 and yellow R=237, G=167, B=0. The blue colour is called &quot;sea blue&quot;, which is a dark to medium blue. It is not very dark navy blue, and not any bright or greenish shade such as turquoise or cyan. 

Red and yellow are used in the coat of arms that appears on the state flag.

==Other rules==
Under Finnish law, it is forbidden to deface the flag or to use it in a disrespectful way. It is also illegal to remove a flag from its pole without permission. Anyone who breaks these regulations may be fined for disgracing the flag.

Finnish law also forbids the use of the presidential standard or state flag without permission, as well as the addition of any extra symbols to the flag. One may not sell a flag that has different colours or geometry from those defined by the law, which considered to be a violation of the regulations and may lead to a fine.

There are also common rules on how to treat the flag respectfully. The flag must not be dirty or damaged. The flag must never touch the ground. When the flag is washed, it must be dried indoors. A worn-out flag must be disposed of by burning (though not with the intent to disgrace it) or alternatively by cutting it to pieces small enough not to be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including any disposal of the flag).

In Finland, the official term for flying a flag at half-mast is known as &quot;suruliputus&quot; (&quot;mourning by flag(ging)&quot;). It is performed by raising the flag briefly to the top of the mast and lowering it approximately one-third of the length of the flagpole, placing the lower hoist corner at half-mast. On wall-mounted and rooftop flagpoles, the middle of the flag should fly at the middle of the flagpole. When removing the flag from half-mast, it is briefly hoisted to the finial before lowering completely. 

Traditionally, private residences and apartment houses fly the national flag at half-mast on the day of the death of a resident, when the flag is displayed at half-mast until sunset or 9:00 p.m., whichever comes first. Flags are also flown at half-mast on the day of the burial, with the exception that the flag is to be hoisted to the finial after the inhumation takes place.

Flags are also to be flown at half-mast by government agencies and embassies across the world on the days of national mourning, and &quot;the entire nation is asked to join in&quot; Such days are the deaths of a former or current Finnish president, as well as significant catastrophic events such as the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the 2011 Norway attacks and significant national events such as the 2004 Konginkangas bus disaster and school shootings of Jokela and Kauhajoki.

Historically, flags were flown at half-mast on the Commemoration Day of Fallen Soldiers which takes place on the third Sunday of May. Originally, the flag was raised to the finial in the morning, displayed at half-mast from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and again raised to the finial for the rest of the day. In 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, the tradition of flying the flag at half-mast was discontinued, and the flag has since been displayed at the finial in a usual manner.


==Yachting club ensigns==
A Finnish speciality is that any yachting club that is registered in Finland may apply to have a flag with the club emblem officially approved for use on yachts: the civil ensign with a white cross of a unit wide superimposed on the blue cross and with the club emblem in the upper hoist corner. Most yachting clubs distribute those ensigns to their members, and they are much used, but their use is not recommended outside Finnish waters to avoid confusion. Officially, however, the yachting club ensign is valid even for international use.

<text>Gyges (, ; Lydian: ; , ; ; ; reigned c. 680-644 BC) was the founder of the Mermnad dynasty of Lydian kings and the first known king of the Lydian kingdom to have attempted to transform it into a powerful empire. Gyges reigned 38 years according to Herodotus.

==Attestations and etymology==
The name is derived from the Ancient Greek form () recorded by Graeco-Roman authors. In addition, the annals of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal refer several times to , king of , to be identified with Gyges, king of the Lydians.

 and are respectively the Akkadian and Greek forms of the Lydian name (), which means &quot;grandfather&quot;. is derived from a common Proto-Indo-European root from which evolved Hittite (), Luwian () and (), and Lycian () in the Anatolian languages family, as well as Latin , all meaning &quot;grandfather&quot;.

Another derivation for suggests that it might be a loanword from Carian (), which was represented in Greek as (), and was a cognate of the various Anatolian words for &quot;grandfather&quot;: Hittite (), Luwian () and (), Milyan (), and Lycian (). If this etymology is accurate, it correlates with the probability of a Carian origin of the Mermnad dynasty.

Attestations of Gyges&#x27;s name from the period of the Lydian kingdom are found on the legends of coins by his great-grandson Alyattes, reading (), meaning &quot;I am of Kukas&quot;.

==Life, reign and death==
Nothing is known about Gyges&#x27;s origins except for the Greek historian Herodotus&#x27;s claim that he was the son of a man named Dascylus.

===Rise to power===
Available historical evidence suggests that Gyges became the king of Lydia by overthrowing his predecessor, the king Candaules of the Heraclid dynasty. Gyges was helped in his coup against Candaules by a Carian prince from Mylasa named Arselis, suggesting that Gyges&#x27;s Mermnad dynasty might have had good relations with Carian aristocrats thanks to which these latter would provide his rebellion with armed support against Candaules. Gyges&#x27;s rise to power happened in the context of a period of turmoil following the invasion of the Cimmerians, a nomadic people from the Eurasian Steppe who had invaded Western Asia, who around 675 BC destroyed the previous major power in Anatolia, the kingdom of Phrygia.

Immediately after Gyges had seized the Lydian throne, the oracle of the god Apollo at Delphi confirmed the legitimacy of his kingship. To thank the oracle, Gyges offered it lavish offerings consisting of gold and silver. These offerings still stood at Delphi in the time of Herodotus, who referred to Gyges&#x27;s dedications as the Gygadas ( , from , meaning &quot;of Kukas (Gyges)&quot;), and remarked that most of the silver at Delphi was part of it. The most notable of these offerings were six crates made of gold and which collectively weighed thirty talents.

===Wars against the Ionians===
Gyges took advantage of the power vacuum created by the Cimmerian invasions to consolidate his kingdom and make it a military power, and, to this end, immediately after coming to power he attacked the Ionian Greek cities of Miletus, Smyrna, and Colophon. Gyges was however unable to conquer Miletus and he made peace with the city, following which Gyges accorded to the Milesians the privilege to colonise the coastal areas of Asia Minor under Lydian control. Gyges&#x27;s attempt to capture Smyrna likewise failed; the inhabitants of the city were successfully able to repel his attacks. After this, peaceful and friendly relations were established between Lydia and this city. Thereafter, the Lydians used the port of Smyrna to export their products and import grain and Lydian craftsmen worked in Smyrnian workshops. These close ties between Smyrna and Lydia ended when Gyges&#x27;s great-grandson Alyattes conquered Smyrna around 600 BC. Gyges&#x27;s attack on Colophon was more successful in that he was able to seize control of its lower city only, and Colophon soon regained its independence and would not be subjected to Lydian rule again until Alyattes conquered it.

===Alliance with the Carians===
To the south, Gyges continued maintaining alliances with the dynasts of the various city-states of the Carians which required the Lydian and Carian rulers had to support each other, and his successors would continue to maintain these alliances and solidify them through matrimonial relations. These connections established between the Lydian kings and the Carian city-states ensured that the Lydians were able to control Caria through alliances with Carian dynasts ruling over fortified settlements, such as Mylasa and Pedasa, and through Lydian aristocrats settled in Carian cities, such as in Aphrodisias. In addition to diplomatic ties, the Lydians also shared strong cultural connections with the Carians, such as sharing the sanctuary of the god Zeus of Mylasa with the Carians and the Mysians because they believed these three peoples descended from three brothers.

Gyges entertained better relations with the leading Aeolian Greek city of Cyme, which had already established relations of friendship with Lydia during the preceding Heraclid dynasty, and with the Ionian Greek city of Ephesus, whose tyrant, Melas the Elder, married one of the daughters of Gyges. These friendly ties with Ephesus would be renewed by Gyges&#x27;s son Ardys through the marriage of his daughter Lyde with Melas&#x27;s grandson Miletus, and by Gyges&#x27;s great-grandson Alyattes, who married one of his daughters to the Ephesian tyrant Melas the Younger, himself a descendant of both Melas the Elder and of Miletus. These friendly relations between Lydia and Ephesus would continue until they would be broken by Gyges&#x27;s great-great-grandson Croesus.

===Wars with the Cimmerians===
In 665 BC, Gyges was faced with a war with the Cimmerians. Around the same time, according to Neo-Assyrian records, Gyges had a dream where the Assyrian god Aššur appeared to him and told him to seek help from Ashurbanipal and send him tribute. Gyges contacted the Neo-Assyrian court by sending diplomats to Nineveh, but offered him presents only, rather than tribute, and therefore refused to become a vassal of Assyria. Gyges soon defeated the Cimmerian invaders without Assyrian help, and he sent Cimmerian soldiers captured while ravaging Lydian lands to Nineveh.

===Conquests===
After having repelled the Cimmerians, and with the leading Aeolian Greek city of Cyme already having good relations with Lydia, Gyges took advantage of the power vacuum caused by the destruction of the Phrygian kingdom by the Cimmerians to conquer the Troad region in northern Anatolia without facing much resistance, following which he installed Lydian settlers in the region and created a hunting reserve in Cyzicus. Under Lydian rule, the city of Ilium acquired an important position and became a local administrative centre from which the Lydians exerted their power over the whole Aegean coast of the Troad as well as the coast of the Hellespont where was located the cities of Achilleion, Abydos, and Neandreia. Furthermore, the Lydian rulers built connections with Illium so they could make profits out of the gold mines of Astyra. The southern part of the Troad, where were located Gargara, Antandrus, Assos, and Lamponeia to the south of Mount Ida and on the shore of the Edremit Gulf, was administered from Adrymettium. In accordance with the monopoly of establishing colonies on lands ruled by the Lydians which Gyges had granted to Miletus, Greek settlers from that city founded the colony of Abydus. 

===Sending mercenaries to Egypt===
Gyges&#x27;s extensive alliances with the Carian dynasts allowed him to recruit Carian and Ionian Greek soldiers to send overseas to assist the Egyptian king Psamtik I of the city of Sais, with whom he had established contacts around 662 BC. With the help of these armed forces, Psamtik I united Egypt under his rule after eliminating the eleven other kinglets with whom he had been co-ruling Lower Egypt following Esarhaddon&#x27;s and Ashurbanipal&#x27;s invasions.

Interpretations of these actions as an alliance between Lydia and Sais against Assyria, however, are inaccurate; Psamtik I&#x27;s military activities were directed solely against the other local kinglets of Lower Egypt and not against Assyria, although Ashurbanipal disapproved of Psamtik I&#x27;s actions since he knew he needed these kinglets&#x27; support to maintain Assyrian power in Egypt. Moreover, not only had the Assyrians risen Sais into preeminence in Egypt after expelling the Saites&#x27; Kushite enemies from the country, but the two kings had signed a treaty with each other, and no hostilities between them is recorded. Thus Psamtik I and Ashurbanipal had remained allies ever since the former had been put in power with Assyrian military support. Furthermore, the silence of Assyrian sources concerning Psamtik I&#x27;s expansion imply there was no hostility, whether overt or covert, between Assyria and Sais during Psamtik I&#x27;s unification of Egypt under his rule.

Likewise, Gyges&#x27;s military support of Psamtik I was not directed against Assyria and is not mentioned as hostile to Assyria or allied with other countries against Assyria in Assyrian records; the Assyrian disapproval of Gyges&#x27;s support for Psamtik I was primarily motivated by Gyges&#x27;s refusal to form an alliance with Assyria and his undertaking of these actions independently of Assyria, which the Assyrians interpreted as an act of arrogance, rather than by the support itself.

Gyges&#x27;s military support to Psamtik I lasted until 658 BC, at which point he faced an impending Cimmerian invasion. The Cimmerians invaded Lydia again in 657 BC, though not much is known about this attack except that Gyges survived it. This event is recorded in the Assyrian oracular reports, where it is called a &quot;bad omen&quot; for the &quot;Westland&quot;, that is for Lydia.

===Death===
In 644 BC, Lydia faced a third attack by the Cimmerians, led by their king Lygdamis. This time, the Lydians were defeated, Sardis was sacked, and Gyges was killed. Assyrian records blamed Gyges&#x27;s defeat and death on his decision to act independently from Assyria by sending troops to Psamtik I, and his ending of diplomacy with Assyria, which the Assyrians interpreted as an act of arrogance. He was succeeded by his son Ardys, who resumed diplomatic activity with Assyria and would also have to face the Cimmerians.

===Legacy===

Gyges&#x27;s name was later used on the legends of coins by his great-grandson Alyattes, which read (), meaning &quot;I am of Kukas&quot;. Some of these coins have a legend (), which is the abbreviation of the Lydian name of Alyattes, (), on one side and on the other side have the legend , which in this context meant &quot;I am the son/descendant of &quot; by which Alyattes was declaring his belonging to the dynasty of Gyges.

==Mythical Gyges==
Like many kings of early antiquity, including Midas of Phrygia and even the more historically documented Alexander the Great, Gyges was subject to mythologizing. The motives for such stories are many; one possibility is that the myths embody religious beliefs or practices.

===Allegorical accounts of Gyges&#x27; rise to power===
Authors throughout ancient history have told differing stories of Gyges&#x27; rise to power, which considerably vary in detail, but virtually all involve Gyges seizing the throne after killing the king, Candaules, and marrying Candaules&#x27; widow.

The main source for Gyges is Herodotus, whose account may be traced to the poet Archilochus of Paros. In this, Gyges was a bodyguard of Candaules, who believed his wife to be the most beautiful woman on Earth. He insisted upon Gyges seeing his wife disrobed and the betrayal so enraged her that she afterwards gave Gyges the choice of murdering her husband and making himself king, or of being put to death himself.

Herodotus goes on to record how Gyges plied the Oracle with numerous gifts, notably six mixing bowls minted of gold extracted from the Pactolus river weighing thirty talents. The Oracle confirmed Gyges as the rightful king of Lydia and gave moral support to the Lydians in their conflict with the Ionians. The priestess nevertheless declared that the dynasty of Gyges would fall in the fifth generation. This prediction was later fulfilled when Gyges&#x27; fourth descendant, Croesus, lost the kingdom as a result of attacking the Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great.

In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, Gyges was a shepherd who discovered a magic ring of invisibility, by means of which he murdered the king and won the affection of the queen. 

Nicolaus of Damascus supplies his own version of the story that is quite different from both Herodotus and Plato. It involves a multi-generational curse by an old King Ardys of Lydia, because his trusted advisor Dascylus was murdered by Ardys’ son named Sadyattes (or Adyattes). This Sadyattes was envious of Dascylus’ growing power. The murderers were never discovered, so King Ardys issued a curse upon them.

Dascylus’ wife, being then pregnant, escapes to Phrygia (her home), and gives birth to a son, also named Dascylus. Later this Dascylus has a son Gyges who, as a young man arrives to Lydia and is recognized by the king for his outstanding abilities. He is appointed to the royal bodyguard.

Gyges soon became a favourite of Candaules and was dispatched by him to fetch Tudo, the daughter of Arnossus of Mysia, whom the Lydian king wished to make his queen. On the way Gyges fell in love with Tudo, who complained to Sadyates of his conduct. Forewarned that the king intended to punish him with death, Gyges assassinated Candaules in the night and seized the throne. According to Plutarch, Gyges seized power with the help of Arselis of Mylasa, the captain of the Lydian bodyguard, whom he had won over to his cause.

===Other legends about Gyges===
In the second book of Plato&#x27;s philosophical work &quot;The Republic&quot;, Glaucon recounts the story of the Ring of Gyges to Socrates, using it to illustrate a point about human nature. Some scholars have suggested that Plato&#x27;s story was based on a now-lost older version of the myth, while others argue that Plato invented it himself, using elements from Herodotus&#x27;s story of Gyges. It told of a man named Gyges who lived in Lydia, an area in modern Turkey. He was a shepherd for the king of that land. One day, there was an earthquake while Gyges was out in the fields, and he noticed that a new cave had opened up in a rock face. When he went in to see what was there, he noticed a gold ring on the finger of a former giant king who had been buried in the cave, in an iron horse with a window in its side. He took the ring away with him and soon discovered that it allowed the wearer to become invisible. The next time he went to the palace to give the king a report about his sheep, he put the ring on, seduced the queen, killed the king, and took control of the palace.

In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Glaucon argues that men are inherently unjust, and are only restrained from unjust behavior by the fetters of law and society. In Glaucon&#x27;s view, unlimited power blurs the difference between just and unjust men. &quot;Suppose there were two such magic rings,&quot; he tells Socrates, &quot;and the just [man] put on one of them and the unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with anyone at his pleasure, or kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a god among men. Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same point.&quot; Socrates concludes, however, that a truly just man is not a slave to his appetites, so that the opportunities afforded by the ring would not tempt him to abandon his principles.

Many Bible scholars believe that Gyges of Lydia was the Biblical figure of Gog, ruler of Magog, who is mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Revelation.

==Influence on modern works==
* Théophile Gautier wrote a story entitled &quot;Le roi Candaule&quot; (published in 1844), which was translated by Lafcadio Hearn.
* &quot;Tsar Kandavl&quot; or &quot;Le Roi Candaule&quot; is a &quot;grand ballet&quot; with choreography by Marius Petipa, and music by Cesare Pugni, with a libretto by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges, based on the Herodotus version. It was first presented by the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1868, with Henriette D&#x27;or as Queen Nisia, Felix Kschessinsky as King Candaules/Tsar Candavl, Lev Ivanov as Gyges and Klavdia Kantsyreva as Claytia.
* &quot;Le Roi Candaule&quot; is also the title of a comedy by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy, loosely based on the ancient tale and presenting light sketches of Parisian life in the 1860s and 1870s.
* German playwright Friedrich Hebbel&#x27;s 1856 tragedy &quot;Gyges und sein Ring&quot; (&quot;Gyges and his Ring&quot;).
* In the novel &quot;Temporary Kings&quot;, penultimate in Anthony Powell&#x27;s 12-volume &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, Candaules&#x27; exhibiting of his naked wife to Gyges and her discovery of it feature on a ceiling painting, attributed to Tiepolo, in a Venetian palace. The story counterpoints themes of voyeurism and death in Powell&#x27;s narrative.
* In the novel &quot;The English Patient&quot;, and the film based on it, Count Almásy (himself a disciple of Herodotus), falls in love with a married woman (Katherine Clifton) as she tells Herodotus&#x27; version of the Gyges story around a campfire. The story is harbinger of their own tragic path.
*In the novel &quot;Hyperion&quot; by Dan Simmons, one of the four evil constructs created by the Core and named by Councillor Albedo is called Gyges.
* One of the chapters in Robertson Davies&#x27; novel &quot;Fifth Business&quot; is called &quot;Gyges and King Candaules&quot;. The protagonist, scholar Dunstan Ramsay; his lifelong &quot;friend and enemy&quot;, the tycoon Percy &quot;Boy&quot; Staunton; and Staunton&#x27;s wife Leola who had been Ramsay&#x27;s childhood sweetheart are throughout the book compared with, respectively, Gyges, King Candaules and the Queen of Lydia. In particular, in one scene where Staunton insists upon showing Ramsay nude photos of his wife, Ramsay tells him the ancient story as a warning (which Staunton ignores).
* In 1990 Frederic Raphael published &quot;The Hidden I, A Myth Revised&quot;, a retelling of the story of Lydia, King Candaules and Gyges.

<text>The national flag of Indonesia is a simple bicolor with two horizontal bands, red (top) and white (bottom) with an overall ratio of 2:3. It was introduced and hoisted in public during the proclamation of independence on 17 August 1945 at 56 Proklamasi Street (formerly Pegangsaan Timur Street) in Jakarta, and again when the Dutch formally transferred sovereignty on 27 December 1949. The design of the flag has remained unchanged since.

The flag of Indonesia is graphically similar to the flag of Monaco, with a slight difference in the shade of red, and ratio of its dimensions. The flag of Poland has similar dimensions but has the colours reversed: white on top and red on the bottom. In both Monaco&#x27;s and Poland&#x27;s flags, the reds are of a slightly darker shade than that of Indonesia. The flag of Singapore has exactly the same dimensions as Indonesia&#x27;s, but supplemented with a white crescent moon and five stars in a pentagram at the upper left corner of the flag, of which the red is of a slightly lighter shade.

The &quot;Naval Jack of Indonesia&quot; is reserved for sole use by the Indonesian Navy. It flies from the jackstaff of every active Indonesian warship while anchored or moored pierside and on special occasions. The design of the jack is described as nine alternating stripes, consisted of five red and four white stripes. It is nicknamed &quot;Sang Saka Merah Putih&quot;, . The naval jack dates to the age of Majapahit Empire. This empire, renowned for its great maritime strength, flew similar jacks on its vessels.

== History ==


The flag&#x27;s colours are derived from the banner of the 13th century Majapahit Empire. However, it has been suggested that the red and white symbolism can trace its origin to the older common Austronesian mythology of the duality of Mother Earth (red) and Father Sky (white). This is why these colours appear in so many flags throughout Austronesia, from Tahiti to Madagascar. The earliest records of the red and white &quot;panji&quot; or &quot;pataka&quot; (a long flag on a curved bamboo pole) can be found in the Pararaton chronicle; according to this source, the Jayakatwang troops from Gelang-Gelang hoisted the red and white banner during their invasion of Singhasari in the early 12th century. This suggests that even before the Majapahit era, the red and white colours were already revered and used as the kingdom&#x27;s banner in the Kediri era (1042 – ).

Red and white textile colouring was available in ancient Indonesia. White is the natural colour of woven cotton fabrics, while red is one of the earliest natural dyes, acquired either from teak leaves, the flowers of &quot;Averrhoa bilimbi&quot;, or the skin of mangosteen fruits.

It was not only the Javanese kingdoms that used red and white. The battle flag of King Si Singamangaraja IX of Batak lands bore an image of white twin swords called &quot;piso gaja dompak&quot; against a red background. During the Aceh War of 1873–1904, Aceh warriors used a battle flag with the image of a sword, star and crescent, sun, and some Quranic script in white on a red background. The red and white flag of the Buginese Bone kingdom in South Sulawesi is called &quot;Woromporang&quot;. The Balinese Badung (Puri Pamecutan) royal banner is red, white, and black. Prince Diponegoro also used a red and white banner during the Java War (1825–1830).
In the early 20th century, these colours were revived by students and then nationalists as an expression of nationalism against the Dutch. A precursor design was first seen on the cover of a Dutch magazine titled &quot;Gedenkboek 1908-1923&quot; run by the Perhimpoenan Indonesia (&#x27;Indonesian Association&#x27;). Compiling 13 letters written by its anonymous members, it had a sinister hoisted flag of a red and white stripe superimposed with the head of a banteng facing away from the hoist. The modern red and white flag sans banteng head was first flown in Java in 1928, it was quickly prohibited under Dutch rule. It became the flag adopted by the Kesatuan Melayu Muda to symbolise Malay nationalism against European colonialism. Upon Indonesia&#x27;s declaration of independence on 17 August 1945, it was adopted as the national flag, and has been in use ever since. After Indonesia&#x27;s independence was recognized, Monaco, which had a similar flag, filed a complaint which was largely ignored.

===Hotel Yamato incident===
The flag featured in a well-known incident during the Indonesian War of Independence when during the lead-up to the Battle of Surabaya in late 1945, Indonesian youths removed a colonial Dutch flag flying over the Yamato Hotel, tore off the blue strip and re-hoisted it as an Indonesian flag. The hotel was subsequently renamed briefly as &quot;Hotel Merdeka&quot;, meaning &quot;independence hotel&quot;.

==Name==
According to Article 35 of the 1945 Constitution, the official name of the flag is &quot;Sang Saka Merah-Putih&quot;. The flag is commonly called &quot;Bendera Merah-Putih&quot; (&#x27;Red-and-White Flag&#x27;). Occasionally, it is also called &quot;Sang Dwiwarna&quot; (&#x27;The Bicolour&#x27;). &quot;Sang Saka Merah-Putih&quot; refers to the historical flag called &quot;Bendera Pusaka&quot; (&#x27;Heirloom Flag&#x27;) and its replica. The Bendera Pusaka is the flag that was flown in front of Sukarno&#x27;s house after he proclaimed Indonesia&#x27;s independence on 17 August 1945. The original &quot;Bendera Pusaka&quot; was sewn by Fatmawati and was hoisted every year in front of the Merdeka Palace during the independence day ceremony. It was hoisted for the last time on 17 August 1968. Since then it has been preserved and replaced by a replica since the original flag was deemed to be too fragile.

==Symbolism==
Several opinions have been expressed on the meaning of the red and white in the Indonesian flag. One of them is that the red stands for courage, while the white stands for purity. Another opinion is that red represents the human body or physical life, while white represents the soul or spiritual life; together they stand for a complete human being.

As Sukarno said:
The colours are the same as those used in the flag of the Majapahit.

==Usage==


===Regulation and flag protocol===

The flag is described in Article 35, Chapter XV, of the Constitution of Indonesia; Law No. 24/2009; and Government Regulation No. 40/1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;UU No 24/2009&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The raising of the flag should be conducted in the time between sunrise until sunset, but in certain circumstances, it can be done at night. In daily use, the flag should be flown at every commemoration such as Indonesian Independence Day on 17 August every year, by the citizens who have a right to use it at house, building or office, schools, colleges, public and private transport and the representative office of Indonesia in overseas.

It can be used as the cover of the coffin of a President or former Presidents, Vice President or former Vice Presidents, Members of Cabinet, Speaker of People&#x27;s Representative Council, and Head of Government, members of the Indonesian Armed Forces, and persons who are members of the Indonesian National Police who died in service, or an Indonesian citizen who made contributions to their nation as a badge of honor.

The flag must be displayed everyday in places such as the Presidential Palace, government and private office buildings, border posts and outer islands in the territory of Indonesia, and the National Heroes Cemetery.

The flag should be displayed everywhere on special days, which are:

*2 May: National Education Day.
*20 May: National Awakening Day.
*1 June: Day of the Birth of Pancasila.
*17 August: Indonesia Independence Day.
*28 October: Youth Pledge Day.
*10 November: Heroes Day.

===Half-mast===

The flag should be displayed at half-mast as a sign of mourning on these days:

*30 September, in remembrance of the 30 September Movement. After the Fall of Suharto and the end of the New Order in 1998, this tradition was stopped. However, the tradition of half-masting the flag on this day has been restarted in recent years.
*12 October, in remembrance of the victims of the 2002 Bali Bombings
*26 December, in remembrance of victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.
*Three days after the death of President or former Presidents, Vice President or former Vice Presidents, Members of Cabinet, Speaker of People&#x27;s Representative Council, and Head of Government.
*Other mourning days established by national or local governments.

# printing on, embroidering or adding letters, numbers, images or other signs, or adding badges or any objects to the national flag;
# using the national flag to cover a ceiling or roof, or for wrapping or covering goods in a way that can degrade the honor of the national flag.

<doc id="78316" wikidata="Q521109" url="?curid=78316" title="Duke of Norfolk">
<text>Duke of Norfolk is a title in the peerage of England. The premier non-royal peer, the Duke of Norfolk is additionally the premier duke and earl in the English peerage. The seat of the Duke of Norfolk is Arundel Castle in Sussex, although the title refers to the county of Norfolk. The current duke is Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk. The dukes have historically been Catholic, a state of affairs known as recusancy in England.

All past and present dukes have been descended from Edward I. The son of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, was Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey; the earl was descended from Edward III. As all subsequent dukes after Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk are descendants of the Earl of Surrey, this means they are also descended from Edward III.

== History ==


Before the Dukes of Norfolk, there were the Bigod Earls of Norfolk, starting with Roger Bigod from Normandy (died 1107). Their male line ended with Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk, who died without an heir in 1306, so their titles and estates reverted to the crown. Edward II then granted his brother, Thomas of Brotherton, the title of Earl of Norfolk in 1312. It passed to Thomas&#x27;s daughter (and granddaughter of Edward I), Margaret, and then to her grandson, Thomas Mowbray.

When Richard II made Thomas Mowbray the Duke of Norfolk in 1397, he conferred upon him the estates and titles (including Earl Marshal) that had belonged to the Earls of Norfolk. His elderly grandmother, Margaret, was still alive, and so at the same time she was created Duchess of Norfolk for life. Mowbray died in exile in 1399, months after his grandmother, and his dukedom was repealed. His widow took the title of &quot;Countess of Norfolk&quot;.

Between 1401 and 1476, the Mowbray family held the title and estates of the Duke of Norfolk. John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk, died without male issue in 1476, his only surviving child being the 3-year-old Anne Mowbray. A marriage was arranged between Anne and Richard, Duke of York, the 4-year-old son of Edward IV. She remained Richard&#x27;s child bride until she died at the age of 8.

In accordance with the marriage arrangements, Richard inherited the lands and wealth of the Mowbray family. He was also made Duke of Norfolk. However, upon the death of Edward IV, the throne was offered to Edward&#x27;s brother, Richard III. After Prince Richard was lodged in June 1483 in the Tower of London, where his elder brother (briefly Edward V) was too, both Richard and Edward were declared illegitimate. They subsequently disappeared, and the titles of both York and Norfolk were forfeited to the crown.

This left John Howard, the son of Thomas Mowbray&#x27;s elder daughter Margaret, as heir to the dukedom, and his support for Richard III&#x27;s accession secured his creation as 1st Duke of Norfolk in 1483, in the title&#x27;s third creation. From this point to the present, the title has remained in the hands of the descendants of John Howard, except for periods when it was temporarily forfeited.

The Catholic faith of the Howard dynasty often resulted in conflict with the reigning monarch, particularly during and after the reign of Henry VIII. In 1546, Thomas Howard, the third Duke, fell out of favour with the dying Henry and was attainted on 27 January 1547; he was stripped of his titles and his lands reverted to the Crown. Imprisoned in the Tower of London, he narrowly escaped execution through Henry&#x27;s death the following day, but remained imprisoned until the death of Edward VI and the accession of the Catholic Queen Mary to the English throne in 1553, upon which his lands and titles were restored to him. However, the Duke died the following year aged around 81, and was succeeded by his grandson Thomas as the fourth Duke of Norfolk.

Following Mary&#x27;s death in 1558 and the accession of her sister Elizabeth I, the Duke was imprisoned for scheming to marry Elizabeth&#x27;s cousin Mary, Queen of Scots. After his release under house arrest in 1570 and subsequent participation in the Ridolfi plot to enthrone Mary and Catholicism in England, he was executed in 1572 for treason and his lands and titles again became forfeit.

In 1660, the fourth Duke&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the 23rd Earl of Arundel, was restored to the family lands and dukedom. Mentally infirm, the fifth Duke never married and died in 1677. He was succeeded by his younger brother Henry as the 6th Duke, through whom the 7th Duke, 8th Duke and 9th Duke of Norfolk were descended in the male-line.

At the death of the 9th Duke, the title was inherited in 1777 by his heir male, Charles Howard, a grandson of Charles Howard of Greystoke, a younger brother of the 5th and 6th Dukes. He was succeeded by his son, Charles, whose lack of a legitimate male heir resulted in the title passing to Bernard Howard, a great-grandson of Bernard Howard of Glossop, the youngest brother of the 5th and 6th Dukes. The title then passed to his son in 1842, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, who was the father of Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 14th Duke of Norfolk, and Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Glossop. By royal licence dated 26 April 1842, the 13th Duke added &quot;Fitzalan&quot; before his children&#x27;s surnames (but not his own), so they all became Fitzalan-Howard, which surname their male-line descendants have borne ever since. Their ancestor, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, married Mary FitzAlan (daughter and heiress of Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel) in 1555.

The title passed through the line of the elder brother from 1856 until the death in 1975 of Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk without male issue. Consequently, he was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, Miles Stapleton-Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk, who was a great-grandson of the aforementioned 1st Baron Howard of Glossop.

The current Duke of Norfolk is Edward Fitzalan-Howard, 18th Duke of Norfolk, who succeeded his father, Miles Stapleton-Fitzalan-Howard, 17th Duke of Norfolk, in 2002. He succeeded as 18th Duke of Norfolk (Premier Duke of England), 36th Earl of Arundel (Premier Earl of England), 19th Earl of Surrey, 16th Earl of Norfolk, 13th Baron Beaumont, 26th Baron Maltravers, 16th Baron FitzAlan, 16th Baron Clun, 16th Baron Oswaldestre, and 5th Baron Howard of Glossop.

The 15th Duke of Norfolk owned almost 50,000 acres with 19,400 acres in the West Riding of Yorkshire, 21,000 acres in Sussex and 4,400 acres in Norfolk.

== Duties and other titles ==
In addition to the ducal title, the dukes of Norfolk also hold the hereditary position of Earl Marshal, which has the duty of organizing state occasions such as the coronation of the monarch and the state opening of Parliament. For the last five centuries, save some periods when it was under attainder, both the dukedom and the earl-marshalship have been in the hands of the Howard family. According to the House of Lords Act 1999, due to his duties as Earl Marshal, Norfolk is one of only two hereditary peers automatically admitted to the House of Lords, without being elected by the general body of hereditary peers (the other being the Lord Great Chamberlain).

Additionally, the Duke of Norfolk participates in the ceremony of the State Opening of Parliament. He is among the four individuals who precede the monarch, and one of the two of these who would traditionally walk facing the sovereign (thus backwards), but this has not been practised in recent years.

As the Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk is head of the College of Arms, through which he regulates all matters connected with armorial bearings and standards, in addition to controlling the arrangements for state functions. He is one of three claimants to the title of Chief Butler of England.

The Duke of Norfolk currently holds the following subsidiary titles:
* Earl of Arundel (1289)
* Earl of Surrey (1483)
* Earl of Norfolk (1644)
* Baron Beaumont (1309)
* Baron Maltravers (1330)
* Baron FitzAlan (1627)
* Baron Clun (1627)
* Baron Oswaldestre (1627)
* Baron Howard of Glossop (1869)

All titles are in the Peerage of England, save for the Barony of Howard of Glossop which is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. All descend to heirs male except the Barony of Beaumont, which can pass in the female line. The style &quot;Earl of Arundel&quot; is used as a courtesy title by the Duke&#x27;s eldest son, the present holder being Henry Fitzalan-Howard, Earl of Arundel. The style &quot;Lord Maltravers&quot; is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son of the Duke&#x27;s eldest son (the Duke&#x27;s grandson).

== Heraldic achievement (coat of arms) ==
== Residences ==
The main residences commonly associated with the Dukes of Norfolk are: Framlingham Castle, Bungay Castle, as well as Clun Castle in Shropshire, which are now largely ruins; Worksop Manor, Carlton Towers, Norfolk House in London, and most notably Arundel Castle.

Framlingham Castle was originally a part of the properties of the Earls of Norfolk, but when the title fell from use, the castle was administered by the crown. In 1397, it was given to Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk, by King Richard II. And when the Mowbray line became extinct, it passed eventually to the Howard family. Major repairs to this castle were carried out in 1485 by John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk (second creation). The castle would remain in the Howard family, and thus the Dukes of Norfolk, for a while, but would eventually pass from their possession. In 1553, for example, Framlingham was given to Mary Tudor, sister of King Edward VI.

Bungay Castle was also originally a part of the properties of the Earls of Norfolk. In 1483, it passed into the possession of John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, and the family continued to own it, apart from brief periods, until the late 20th century. However, the castle has long been in a state of decay. Consequently, in 1987, the 17th Duke of Norfolk presented the castle to the town, which had already begun its own restoration attempts, with an endowment towards its preservation. It is now owned and administered by the Castle Trust.
Carlton Towers is in Carlton, North Yorkshire. It is a Victorian gothic country house remodelled by Edward Welby Pugin for the 8th Baron Beaumont. It is the Yorkshire home of the Duke of Norfolk. Though the Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s family still live in part of the house, it is now largely used for wedding receptions and similar events.

Arundel Castle has been the principal seat of the Dukes of Norfolk and their ancestors for more than 850 years. Built in the 11th century by Roger de Montgomery, Earl of Arundel, the castle was seized by the crown in 1102. King Henry II, who added on to the castle, in 1155 confirmed William d&#x27;Aubigny as Earl of Arundel, with the honour and the castle of Arundel. Arundel Castle is still to this day the home of The Duke and Duchess of Norfolk and their children. The Fitzalan Chapel, founded in 1390 by the 4th Earl of Arundel, is located on the western grounds outside the castle, and has been the burial place of the most recent Dukes of Norfolk.

Glossop Hall as an occasional residence is situated in the High Peak District of Derbyshire. As the family became closely connected with Sheffield, the Farm in Glossop became increasingly used, particularly when Henry Howard lived there in the 1760s; when the 14th Duke enlarged The Farm as an occasional residence; and during the time of the 15th Duke, Henry Granville Fitzalan-Howard, who had interest in the activities of the city. The Glossop estate was sold by the family in 1925.

== List of titleholders ==

=== Duchess of Norfolk (1397) ===

=== Dukes of Norfolk (1397) ===

=== Dukes (Royal) of Norfolk (1477) ===

=== Dukes of Norfolk (1483) ===



The heir apparent is the Duke&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Miles Fitzalan-Howard, &quot;styled&quot; Earl of Arundel (b. 1987).

==Remainder==
In 1660, the 23rd Earl of Arundel was restored to the Dukedom of Norfolk with remainder to:

#the heirs male of his body (&quot;he never married&quot;)
#the heirs male of his father Henry Howard, the 22nd Earl
##Hon. Henry Howard (&quot;extinct in 1777&quot;)
##Hon. Philip Howard (&quot;extinct in 1694&quot;)
##Hon. Charles Howard (&quot;extinct in 1815&quot;)
##Hon. Talbot Howard
##Hon. Edward Howard
##Hon. Francis Howard
##Hon. Bernard Howard (&quot;the present line&quot;)
##Hon. Esme Howard (&quot;extinct in 1728&quot;)
##Hon. John Howard (&quot;extinct in 1711&quot;)
#the heirs male of his grandfather Thomas Howard, 21st Earl
##Henry Howard, the 22nd Earl
##William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford (&quot;extinct in 1762&quot;)
#the heirs male of his great-grandfather Philip Howard, 20th Earl, eldest son of the fourth Duke (&quot;he had none apart from the 21st Earl&quot;)
##Thomas Howard, 21st Earl
#the heirs male in the line of descent from Thomas Howard, younger half-brother of Philip Howard, 20th Earl
##Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk (&quot;extinct in 1745&quot;)
##Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Berkshire (&quot;currently extant&quot;)
##Hon. Henry Howard (&quot;extinct in 1616&quot;)
##Hon. Sir Charles Howard (&quot;extinct in 1626&quot;)
##Hon. Sir Robert Howard (&quot;extinct in 1653&quot;)
##Hon. Sir William Howard
##Edward Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Escrick (&quot;extinct in 1715&quot;)
#the heirs male descended from Lord William Howard, younger half-brother of Philip Howard, 20th Earl: (&quot;both lines currently extant&quot;)
##the heirs male in the senior line of descent from Lord William Howard through his elder son Sir Philip Howard, grandfather of the first Earl of Carlisle
##the heirs male in the junior line of descent from Lord William Howard through his second son Francis, ancestor of the Howards of Corby Castle, Cumberland, England.

In the event all the currently extant lines of descent from the fourth Duke fail in the male line, the Dukedom of Norfolk and its subsidiary titles will become extinct; though there exists a currently extant branch of the Howard dynasty, the Earls of Effingham, in descent from the second Duke, their line was unaccountably omitted from the 1660 remainder.

<doc id="78323" wikidata="Q103055" url="?curid=78323" title="Flag of Liechtenstein">
<text>The national flag of the Principality of Liechtenstein () consists of two horizontal bands, one blue and one red, charged with a gold crown in the canton. In use since 1764 and officially enshrined into the nation&#x27;s constitution in 1921, it has been the flag of the principality since that year. The crown was added to the flag in 1937, after the country discovered at the Summer Olympics held the previous year that their flag was identical to the Haitian civil flag.

==History==

Liechtenstein was formed in 1719 as a principality within the Holy Roman Empire and gained complete independence in 1866. Within this period, the colours blue and red were selected to feature on the flag, instead of the gold and red on the coat of arms that would have customarily been employed instead. These new livery colours were first utilized by Prince Joseph Wenzel I in 1764.

A new constitution for the Principality was formulated and proclaimed in October 1921. It made the blue and red banner the national flag by granting it &quot;official status&quot;. Fifteen years later, during the 1936 Summer Olympics, the country came to the realization that its flag was identical to the flag of Haiti (Haiti took part in the Opening Ceremony but its sole athlete did not compete). Because of this finding, the government added the prince&#x27;s crown to the canton. This change served two purposes – to signify Liechtenstein&#x27;s position as a principality, and to distinguish its flag from Haiti&#x27;s. This modified design was adopted on 24 June 1937.

<doc id="78326" wikidata="Q133022" url="?curid=78326" title="Flag of Luxembourg">
<text>The national flag of Luxembourg consists of three horizontal stripes, watermelon red, white and light blue, and can be in 1:2 or 3:5 ratio. It was first used between 1845 and 1848 and officially adopted in 1993. It is informally called in the country, &quot;«rout, wäiß, blo»&quot; (&quot;red, white, blue&quot;).

Luxembourg had no flag until 1830, when patriots were urged to display the national colours. The flag was defined as a horizontal tricolour of red, white, and blue in 1848, but it was not officially adopted until 1993. The tricolour flag of Luxembourg is graphically almost identical to the flag of the Netherlands, except that it is longer and its light blue stripe and red stripe are a lighter shade. The red, white, and light blue colours were derived from the coat of arms of the House of Luxembourg.

==History==
The colours of the flag of Luxembourg were first adopted around 1830 during the Belgian Revolution. They were probably derived from the coat of arms of the County and later Duchy of Luxembourg, which in turn was derived from the combination of the lion of the dukes of Limbourg and the supposed striped banner of the early counts of Luxembourg. The three-coloured horizontal design was fixed on 12 June 1845.

It took until 1993 before a law was passed regulating the flag of Luxembourg. The same law also prescribed ensign and roundel for aircraft and ships registered in Luxembourg.

One important clarification brought by this law was that the color blue was defined as being a bright blue, in contrast to the flag of the Netherlands (exactly the same design, but the Dutch flag uses dark blue and a less oblong shape).

The heraldic blazon for the flag is &quot;per fess Gules and Azure, a fess Argent&quot;.

==Ensign==

The red lion is the official ensign for ships registered in Luxembourg. It is used for river and sea shipping, as well as for aviation. This flag is based on the coat of arms of Luxembourg (a banner of arms) and is used as the ensign to avoid the possibility of Luxembourg&#x27;s ensign being confused for that of the Netherlands. Ten white and blue stripes serve as the field for a red lion with a yellow tongue, claws and crown, and a doubled tail (&quot;à la queue fourchée&quot;). The proper ratio for this ensign is 5:7.

The &quot;Règlement Grand-Ducal&quot; of 27 July 1993 defined the ensign&#x27;s colours as follows:

== Roundel ==

The roundel of Luxembourg is seen on the AWACS aircraft used by NATO and on the Airbus A400M operated by the Luxembourg Armed Forces.

==Flag change debate==
The resemblance of the Luxembourgish flag with the Dutch flag has given rise to a national debate to change it.

On 5 October 2006, MP Michel Wolter introduced a legislative proposition to replace the current red-white-blue national flag with the red lion ensign. He argued that the current flag was commonly confused with that of the Netherlands and that the red lion on the other hand was more popular, more aesthetic and of greater historic value. Wolter also claimed he had personally discussed the matter with some three hundred people, most of whom expressed their support for his initiative. On the other hand, many national politicians (including leading members of Wolter&#x27;s own CSV) and VIPs have expressed astonishment in the local media concerning both the timing and necessity for such a change. Wolter was supported in his initiative by the ADR.

On 24 October 2006, a local initiative called &quot;Initiativ Roude Léiw&quot; (&quot;Red Lion Initiative&quot;) held a press conference explaining their intention to support Wolter&#x27;s project on a non-partisan basis. Their first actions would include distribution of red lion bumper stickers, a petition and a poll. During sporting events like the Tour de France supporters for Luxembourg participants now overwhelmingly use the Ensign instead of the Flag.

In end of July 2015, a Luxembourger Marc Dax submitted a formal petition to the Chamber of Deputies to replace the current national flag with the &quot;Roude Léiw&quot;. It received a little less than 500 signatures.

For historical reasons, the adjacent Belgian province of Luxembourg uses a flag that also features a lion superimposed on horizontal stripes. Elsewhere, similar designs can also be found, for instance in the Belgian city of Bruges and the German state of Hesse.

=== Two civil official flags ===
On 6 July 2007, the Government stated that the &quot;Roude Léiw&quot; would be accepted as a Civil flag only within the territory of the Grand-Duchy along with the National flag keeping the same proportions, i.e. 1:2 or 3:5 as the National flag to avoid confusion with the Civil ensign.

<doc id="78328" wikidata="Q720501" url="?curid=78328" title="Hyssopus (plant)">
<text>Hyssopus (hyssop) is a genus of herbaceous or semi-woody plants in the family Lamiaceae, native from the east Mediterranean to central Asia as far east as Mongolia. They are aromatic, with erect branched stems up to 60 cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips. The leaves are narrow oblong, 2–5 cm long. The small blue flowers are borne on the upper part of the branches during summer. By far the best-known species is the herb hyssop (&quot;H. officinalis&quot;), widely cultivated outside its native area in the Mediterranean.

Though commonly called &quot;hyssop&quot;, anise hyssop (&quot;Agastache foeniculum&quot;; also called blue giant hyssop) and all &quot;Agastache&quot; species are not members of &quot;Hyssopus&quot;. However, both genera are in the mint family. 

;Species
# &quot;Hyssopus ambiguus&quot; (Trautv.) Iljin ex Prochorov. &amp; Lebel - Altai Republic of Russia, Kazakhstan
# &quot;Hyssopus cuspidatus&quot; Boriss. - Altai Republic, Kazakhstan, Xinjiang, Mongolia
# &quot;Hyssopus latilabiatus&quot; C.Y.Wu &amp; H.W.Li - Xinjiang
# &quot;Hyssopus macranthus&quot; Boriss. - Altai Republic of Russia, Western Siberia, Kazakhstan
# &quot;Hyssopus officinalis&quot; L. - central + southern Europe, Algeria, Morocco, east to Iran
# &quot;Hyssopus seravschanicus&quot; (Dub.) Pazij - Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan
# &quot;Hyssopus subulifolius&quot; (Rech.f.) Rech.f. - Afghanistan.

==History==
The name &quot;hyssop&quot; can be traced back almost unchanged through the Greek ύσσωπος (). The name hyssop appears in some translations of the Bible, but researchers have suggested that the Biblical accounts refer not to the plant currently known as hyssop but rather to a related herb. The Septuagint translates the name as ὕσσωπος &quot;hyssop&quot;, and English translations of the Bible often follow this rendering. The Hebrew word אזוב (&quot;esov&quot; or &quot;esob&quot;) and the Greek word ὕσσωπος probably share a common (unknown) origin. The biblical plant is discussed further at ezov.

==End Uses==
The herb hyssop is used both as a condiment and a medicine. Hyssop leaves and flowers are used to flavor salads and soups. It is also used in the preparation of liquor and perfumes. In addition, it is used as a pot herb.

This herb is used in the treatment of throat and lung complaints, and is regarded as a stimulant, carminative, and expectorant. It is also effective in treating nervous disorders and toothache. Additionally, it is useful for treating pulmonary, digestive, uterine, urinary and asthma problems. Its leaves are stimulant, stomachic, carminative, and soothing to colic, and its juice is used to treat roundworms.

In addition to its use as a flavoring agent in bitters and tonics, hyssop oil is also used in perfumery. Various types of bronchial catarrh and asthma can be treated with it in small quantities.

<doc id="78329" wikidata="Q370979" url="?curid=78329" title="AmigaGuide">
<text>AmigaGuide is a hypertext document file format designed for the Amiga. It was developed in the early 1990s and released to the market in 1992. Files are stored in ASCII so it is possible to read and edit a file without the need for special software.

Since Workbench 2.1 an Amiga Guide system for O.S. inline help files and reading manuals with hypertext formatting elements was launched in AmigaOS and based on a viewer called simply &quot;AmigaGuide&quot; and it has been included as standard feature on the Amiga system. Users with earlier versions of Workbench could view the files by downloading the program and library AmigaGuide 34 distributed with public domain collections of floppy disks (for example on Fred Fish collection) or it could be downloaded directly from Aminet software repository. Starting from AmigaOS 3.0 the AmigaGuide tool was replaced with the more complete and flexible MultiView.

==AmigaGuide and MultiView==
AmigaGuide is the default tool for viewing AmigaGuide files used with AmigaOS 2.1, and is also a basic text viewer for ASCII documents. It can handle multiple files thanks to cross-linking tables called XREF.

MultiView is basically a void container and a natural GUI for the various datatypes that open MultiView as a default tool when any media file (including AmigaGuide files) are invoked by mouse clicking and recognized by the existing correspondent datatype.

==AmigaGuide readers on various platforms==
Although the AmigaGuide format is almost solely used for documenting Amiga programs, viewers are available for several other platforms:

*Java - JAGUaR
*DOS - AGView
*Windows - AGWViewer WinGuide (LHA archive) WinGuide (ZIP archive)
*Linux - AGReader
*Macintosh - Grotag A little free Open Source viewer of AmigaGuide files on Macintosh computers.

==Syntax==
An AmigaGuide document is a simple ASCII-formatted document, so it can be edited by any normal text editor and viewed by any text reader software.

AmigaGuide commands all begin with the &#x27;@&#x27; (pronounced &#x27;at&#x27;) symbol. To be recognized as an AmigaGuide document, the first line should include this text:

codice_1

There are three categories of commands: Global, Node, and Attributes. Global commands are usually specified at the beginning of the document, before any nodes are defined, and apply to all the nodes in the document. Technically, they can be anywhere. Many commands can be used both globally and in nodes.

Node commands are usable inside a node (after an &#x27;@NODE&#x27; and before an &quot;@ENDNODE&quot;), and affect only the node in which they are used.

Attributes may be specified anywhere in a normal line. In addition to the &#x27;@&#x27; symbol, attributes always use a pair of braces (&#x27;{&#x27; and &#x27;}&#x27;) to enclose the attribute name and possibly additional arguments.

===Main commands===
The commands &quot;INDEX&quot;, &quot;HELP&quot;, &quot;NEXT&quot;, &quot;PREV&quot;, and &quot;TOC&quot; and the all-purpose hypertext link specify other nodes to jump to. They all support the naming of nodes within the current document, but they also all support a path along with that name which lets the node be located in any AmigaGuide document.

They will be shown as simply embossed text squared buttons in the page of MultiView.

===External links===
To access a node in another document, it is simply required to put an AmigaDOS file path before the node name. From this point of view, AmigaGuide is a very simple hypertext language.

===Multimedia===
Since AmigaOS 3.0 or above, the user can jump to any file that is supported by Amiga datatypes – pictures, animation, anything. It uses the MultiView program to handle it through its internal support for the datatype Amiga standard. The user must still give a &quot;node&quot; name, even though the file is not an AmigaGuide file and has no &quot;nodes&quot; – so the syntax is:

codice_2

<text>Inanna is the ancient Mesopotamian goddess of love, war, and fertility. She is also associated with sensuality, procreation, divine law, and political power. Originally worshipped in Sumer, she was known by the Akkadian Empire, Babylonians, and Assyrians as Ishtar (and occasionally the logogram ). Her primary title is &quot;the Queen of Heaven&quot;.

She was the patron goddess of the Eanna temple at the city of Uruk, her early main cult center. In archaic Uruk she was worshipped in three forms: morning Inanna (Inana-UD/hud), evening Inanna (Inanna sig) and princely Inanna (Inanna NUN), the former two reflecting the phases of her associated planet Venus. Her most prominent symbols include the lion and the eight-pointed star. Her husband is the god Dumuzid (later known as Tammuz), and her (attendant) is the goddess Ninshubur, later conflated with the male deities Ilabrat and Papsukkal.

Inanna was worshipped in Sumer at least as early as the Uruk period (), and her cultic activity was relatively localized before the conquest of Sargon of Akkad. During the post-Sargonic era, she became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Sumerian pantheon, with temples across Mesopotamia. The cult of Inanna/Ishtar, which may have been associated with a variety of sexual rites, was continued by the East Semitic-speaking peoples (Akkadians, Assyrians and Babylonians) who succeeded and absorbed the Sumerians in the region.

She was especially beloved by the Assyrians, who elevated her to become the highest deity in their pantheon, ranking above their own national god Ashur. Inanna/Ishtar is alluded to in the Hebrew Bible, and she greatly influenced the Ugaritic goddess Ashtart and later the Phoenician goddess Astarte, who in turn possibly influenced the development of the Greek goddess Aphrodite. Her cult continued to flourish until its gradual decline between the first and sixth centuries CE in the wake of Christianity.

Inanna appears in more myths than any other Sumerian deity. She also has a uniquely high number of epithets and alternate names, comparable only to Nergal.

Many of her myths involve her taking over the domains of other deities. She is believed to have been given the , which represent all positive and negative aspects of civilization, by Enki, the god of wisdom. She is also believed to have taken over the Eanna temple from An, the god of the sky. Alongside her twin brother Utu (later known as Shamash), Inanna is the enforcer of divine justice; she destroyed Mount Ebih for having challenged her authority, unleashed her fury upon the gardener Shukaletuda after he raped her in her sleep, and tracked down the bandit woman Bilulu and killed her in divine retribution for having murdered Dumuzid. In the standard Akkadian version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Ishtar asks Gilgamesh to become her consort. When he disdainfully refuses, she unleashes the Bull of Heaven, resulting in the death of Enkidu and Gilgamesh&#x27;s subsequent grapple with his own mortality.

Inanna&#x27;s most famous myth is the story of her descent into and return from the ancient Mesopotamian underworld, ruled by her older sister Ereshkigal. After she reaches Ereshkigal&#x27;s throne room, the seven judges of the underworld deem her guilty and strike her dead. Three days later, Ninshubur pleads with all the gods to bring Inanna back. All of them refuse her, except Enki, who sends two sexless beings to rescue Inanna.

They escort Inanna out of the underworld but the , the guardians of the underworld, drag her husband Dumuzid down to the underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid is eventually permitted to return to heaven for half the year, while his sister Geshtinanna remains in the underworld for the other half, resulting in the cycle of the seasons.

== Etymology ==

Scholars believe that Inanna and Ishtar were originally separate, unrelated deities, but were conflated with one another during the reign of Sargon of Akkad and came to be regarded as effectively the same goddess under two different names. Inanna&#x27;s name may derive from the Sumerian phrase , meaning &quot;Lady of Heaven&quot;, but the cuneiform sign for &quot;Inanna&quot; () is not a ligature of the signs &quot;lady&quot; (Sumerian: ; cuneiform: SAL.TUG) and &quot;sky&quot; (Sumerian: ; cuneiform: AN). These difficulties led some early Assyriologists to suggest that Inanna may have originally been a Proto-Euphratean goddess, who was only later accepted into the Sumerian pantheon. This idea was supported by Inanna&#x27;s youthfulness, as well as the fact that, unlike the other Sumerian divinities, she seems to have initially lacked a distinct sphere of responsibilities. The view that there was a Proto-Euphratean substrate language in Southern Iraq before Sumerian is not widely accepted by modern Assyriologists.

The name &quot;Ishtar&quot; occurs as an element in personal names from both the pre-Sargonic and post-Sargonic eras in Akkad, Assyria, and Babylonia. It is of Semitic derivation and is probably etymologically related to the name of the West Semitic god Attar, who is mentioned in later inscriptions from Ugarit and southern Arabia. The morning star may have been conceived as a male deity who presided over the arts of war and the evening star may have been conceived as a female deity who presided over the arts of love. Among the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians, the name of the male god eventually supplanted the name of his female counterpart, but, due to extensive syncretism with Inanna, the deity remained as female, although her name was in the masculine form.

==Origins and development==
Inanna has posed a problem for many scholars of ancient Sumer due to the fact that her sphere of power contained more distinct and contradictory aspects than that of any other deity. Two major theories regarding her origins have been proposed. The first explanation holds that Inanna is the result of a syncretism between several previously unrelated Sumerian deities with totally different domains. The second explanation holds that Inanna was originally a Semitic deity who entered the Sumerian pantheon after it was already fully structured, and who took on all the roles that had not yet been assigned to other deities.

As early as the Uruk period (), Inanna was already associated with the city of Uruk. During this period, the symbol of a ring-headed doorpost was closely associated with Inanna. The famous Uruk Vase (found in a deposit of cult objects of the Uruk III period) depicts a row of naked men carrying various objects, including bowls, vessels, and baskets of farm products, and bringing sheep and goats to a female figure facing the ruler. The female stands in front of Inanna&#x27;s symbol of the two twisted reeds of the doorpost, while the male figure holds a box and stack of bowls, the later cuneiform sign signifying the , or high priest of the temple.

Seal impressions from the Jemdet Nasr period () show a fixed sequence of symbols representing various cities, including those of Ur, Larsa, Zabalam, Urum, Arina, and probably Kesh. This list probably reflects the report of contributions to Inanna at Uruk from cities supporting her cult. A large number of similar seals have been discovered from phase I of the Early Dynastic period () at Ur, in a slightly different order, combined with the rosette symbol of Inanna. These seals were used to lock storerooms to preserve materials set aside for her cult.

Various inscriptions in the name of Inanna are known, such as a bead in the name of King Aga of Kish , or a tablet by King Lugal-kisalsi :

During the Akkadian period (), following the conquests of Sargon of Akkad, Inanna and originally independent Ishtar became so extensively syncretized that they became regarded as effectively the same. The Akkadian poet Enheduanna, the daughter of Sargon, wrote numerous hymns to Inanna, identifying her with Ishtar. As a result of this, the popularity of Inanna/Ishtar&#x27;s cult skyrocketed. Alfonso Archi, who was involved in early excavations of Ebla, assumes Ishtar was originally a goddess venerated in the Euphrates valley, pointing out that an association between her and the desert poplar is attested in the most ancient texts from both Ebla and Mari. He considers her, a moon god (e.g., Sin) and a sun deity of varying gender (Shamash/Shapash) to be the only deities shared between various early Semitic peoples of Mesopotamia and ancient Syria, who otherwise had different not necessarily overlapping pantheons.

==Worship==
Gwendolyn Leick assumes that during the Pre-Sargonic era, the cult of Inanna was rather limited, though other experts argue that she was already the most prominent deity in Uruk and a number of other political centers in the Uruk period. She had temples in Nippur, Lagash, Shuruppak, Zabalam, and Ur, but her main cult center was the Eanna temple in Uruk, whose name means &quot;House of Heaven&quot; (Sumerian: ; cuneiform: E.AN). Some research assumes that the original patron deity of this fourth-millennium BCE city was An. After its dedication to Inanna, the temple seems to have housed priestesses of the goddess. Next to Uruk, Zabalam was the most important early site of Inanna worship, as the name of the city was commonly written with the signs MUŠ and UNUG, meaning respectively &quot;Inanna&quot; and &quot;sanctuary&quot;. It is possible that the city goddess of Zabalam was originally a distinct deity, though one whose cult was absorbed by that of the Urukean goddess very early on. Joan Goodnick Westenholz proposed that a goddess identified by the name Nin-UM (reading and meaning uncertain), associated with Ishtaran in a &quot;zame&quot; hymn, was the original identity of Inanna of Zabalam.

In the Old Akkadian period, Inanna merged with the Akkadian goddess Ishtar, associated with the city of Agade. A hymn from that period addresses the Akkadian Ishtar as &quot;Inanna of the Ulmaš&quot; alongside Inanna of Uruk and of Zabalam. The worship of Ishtar and syncretism between her and Inanna was encouraged by Sargon and his successors, and as a result she quickly became one of the most widely venerated deities in the Mesopotamian pantheon. In inscriptions of Sargon, Naram-Sin, and Shar-Kali-Sharri, Ishtar is the most frequently invoked deity.

In the Old Babylonian period, her main cult centers were Uruk, Zabalam, Agade, and Ilip. Her cult was also introduced from Uruk to Kish.

During later times, while her cult in Uruk continued to flourish, Ishtar also became particularly worshipped in the Upper Mesopotamian kingdom of Assyria (modern northern Iraq, northeast Syria, and southeast Turkey), especially in the cities of Nineveh, Aššur, and Arbela (modern Erbil). During the reign of the Assyrian king Assurbanipal, Ishtar rose to become the most important and widely venerated deity in the Assyrian pantheon, surpassing even the Assyrian national god Ashur. Votive objects found in her primary Assyrian temple indicate that she was a popular deity among women.

Individuals who went against the gender binary were heavily involved in the cult of Inanna. During Sumerian times, a set of priests known as worked in Inanna&#x27;s temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations. Men who became sometimes adopted female names, and their songs were composed in the Sumerian dialect, which, in literary texts, is normally reserved for the speech of female characters. Some Sumerian proverbs seem to suggest that had a reputation for engaging in anal sex with men. During the Akkadian Period, and were servants of Ishtar who dressed in female clothing and performed war dances in Ishtar&#x27;s temples. Several Akkadian proverbs seem to suggest that they may have also had homosexual proclivities. Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian &quot;hijra&quot;. In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women.

Throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, it was widely believed that the cult of Inanna involved a &quot;sacred marriage&quot; ritual, in which a king would establish his legitimacy by taking on the role of Dumuzid and engaging in ritual sexual intercourse with the high priestess of Inanna, who took on the role of the goddess. This view has been challenged, however, and scholars continue to debate whether the sacred marriage described in literary texts involved any kind of physical ritual enactment at all and, if so, whether this ritual enactment involved actual intercourse or merely the symbolic representation of intercourse. The scholar of the ancient Near East Louise M. Pryke states that most scholars now maintain, if the sacred marriage was a ritual that was actually acted out, then it involved only symbolic intercourse.

The cult of Ishtar was long thought to have involved sacred prostitution, but this is now rejected among many scholars. Hierodules known as are reported to have worked in Ishtar&#x27;s temples, but it is unclear if such priestesses actually performed any sex acts, and several modern scholars have argued that they did not. Women across the ancient Near East worshipped Ishtar by dedicating to her cakes baked in ashes (known as ). A dedication of this type is described in an Akkadian hymn. Several clay cake molds discovered at Mari are shaped like naked women with large hips who are clutching their breasts. Some scholars have suggested that the cakes made from these molds were intended as representations of Ishtar herself. In the Biblical book of Jeremiah, the prophet condemns Judean female refugees for worshipping the Queen of Heaven (a syncretism of Ishtar and Asherah) by baking cakes with the goddess&#x27;s image upon them and pouring libations to her (Jer. Ch. 7 and 44). The women and their husbands defy him, and state that they will follow the practices of their ancestors, who performed these acts &quot;in the towns of Judea and the streets of Jerusalem&quot; (Jer. 44:15–19). In Ezekiel 8:14, the prophet has a vision of the women of Jerusalem weeping for Tammuz.

==Iconography==
===Symbols===
Inanna/Ishtar&#x27;s most common symbol was the eight-pointed star, though the exact number of points sometimes varies; six-pointed stars also occur frequently, but their symbolic meaning is unknown. The eight-pointed star seems to have originally borne a general association with the heavens, but, by the Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 – 1531 BCE), it had come to be specifically associated with the planet Venus, with which Ishtar was identified. Starting during this same period, the star of Ishtar was normally enclosed within a circular disc. During later Babylonian times, slaves who worked in Ishtar&#x27;s temples were sometimes branded with the seal of the eight-pointed star. On boundary stones and cylinder seals, the eight-pointed star is sometimes shown alongside the crescent moon, which was the symbol of Sin (Sumerian Nanna) and the rayed solar disk, which was a symbol of Shamash (Sumerian Utu).

Inanna&#x27;s cuneiform ideogram was a hook-shaped twisted knot of reeds, representing the doorpost of the storehouse, a common symbol of fertility and plenty. The rosette was another important symbol of Inanna, which continued to be used as a symbol of Ishtar after their syncretism. During the Neo-Assyrian Period (911 – 609 BCE), the rosette may have actually eclipsed the eight-pointed star and become Ishtar&#x27;s primary symbol. The temple of Ishtar in the city of Aššur was adorned with numerous rosettes.

Inanna/Ishtar was associated with lions, which the ancient Mesopotamians regarded as a symbol of power. Her associations with lions began during Sumerian times; a chlorite bowl from the temple of Inanna at Nippur depicts a large feline battling a giant snake and a cuneiform inscription on the bowl reads &quot;Inanna and the Serpent&quot;, indicating that the cat is supposed to represent the goddess. During the Akkadian Period, Ishtar was frequently depicted as a heavily armed warrior goddess with a lion as one of her attributes.

Doves were also prominent animal symbols associated with Inanna/Ishtar. Doves are shown on cultic objects associated with Inanna as early as the beginning of the third millennium BCE. Lead dove figurines were discovered in the temple of Ishtar at Aššur, dating to the thirteenth century BCE and a painted fresco from Mari, Syria shows a giant dove emerging from a palm tree in the temple of Ishtar, indicating that the goddess herself was sometimes believed to take the form of a dove.

===As the planet Venus===
Inanna was associated with the planet Venus, which is named after her Roman equivalent. Several hymns praise Inanna in her role as the goddess or personification of the planet Venus. Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has argued that, in many myths, Inanna&#x27;s movements may correspond with the movements of Venus across the sky. In &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent to the Underworld&quot;, Inanna, unlike any other deity, is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the West and then rising again in the East. An introductory hymn describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for , what could be presumed to be the mountains, replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West. In &quot;Inanna and Shukaletuda&quot;, Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the Eastern and Western horizons. In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.

Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it disappears due to its proximity to the Sun, for many days at a time, and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not recognize Venus as a single entity; instead, they assumed it to be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening star. Nonetheless, a cylinder seal from the Jemdet Nasr period indicates that the ancient Sumerians knew that the morning and evening stars were the same celestial object. The discontinuous movements of Venus relate to both mythology as well as Inanna&#x27;s dual nature.

Modern astrologers recognize the story of Inanna&#x27;s descent into the underworld as a reference to an astronomical phenomenon associated with retrograde Venus. Seven days before retrograde Venus makes its inferior conjunction with the sun, it disappears from the evening sky. The seven day period between this disappearance and the conjunction itself is seen as the astronomical phenomenon on which the myth of descent was based. After the conjunction, seven more days elapse before Venus appears as the morning star, corresponding to the ascent from the underworld.

Inanna in her aspect as Anunītu was associated with the eastern fish of the zodiacal constellation, Pisces. Her consort Dumuzi was associated with the contiguous constellation, Aries.

==Character==
The Sumerians worshipped Inanna as the goddess of both warfare and love. Unlike other gods, whose roles were static and whose domains were limited, the stories of Inanna describe her as moving from conquest to conquest. She is portrayed as young and impetuous, constantly striving for more power than had been allotted to her.

While she was worshipped as the goddess of love, Inanna was not the goddess of marriage, nor was she ever viewed as a mother goddess. Andrew R. George goes as far as stating that &quot;According to all mythology, 
Ištar was not[...] temperamentally disposed&quot; towards such functions.
Julia M. Asher-Greve has even championed the significance of Inanna specifically because she is not a mother-goddess.
As a love goddess, she was commonly invoked by Mesopotamians in incantations.

In &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent to the Underworld&quot;, Inanna treats her lover Dumuzid in a very capricious manner. This aspect of Inanna&#x27;s personality is emphasized in the later standard Akkadian version of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; in which Gilgamesh points out Ishtar&#x27;s infamous ill-treatment of her lovers. However, according to assyriologist Dina Katz, the portrayal of Inanna&#x27;s relationship with Dumuzi in the Descent myth is unusual.

Inanna was also worshipped as one of the Sumerian war deities. One of the hymns dedicated to her declares: &quot;She stirs confusion and chaos against those who are disobedient to her, speeding carnage and inciting the devastating flood, clothed in terrifying radiance. It is her game to speed conflict and battle, untiring, strapping on her sandals.&quot; Battle itself was occasionally referred to as the &quot;Dance of Inanna&quot;. Epithets related to lions in particular were meant to highlight this aspect of her character. As a war goddess she was sometimes referred to with the name Irnina (&quot;victory&quot;), though this epithet could be applied to other deities as well, in addition to functioning as a distinct goddess linked to Ningishzida rather than to Ishtar. Another epithet highlighting this aspect of Ishtar&#x27;s nature was Anunitu (&quot;the martial one&quot;). Like Irnina, Anunitu could also be a separate deity, and as such she is first attested in documents from the Ur III period.

Assyrian royal curse-formulas invoked both of Ishtar&#x27;s primary functions at once, invoking her to remove potency and martial valor alike. Mesopotamian texts indicate that traits perceived as heroic (such as a king&#x27;s ability to lead his troops and to triumph over enemies) and sexual prowess were regarded as interconnected.

While generally classified as a goddess, Inanna/Ishtar could seem at times to have ambiguous gender. Gary Beckman states that &quot;ambiguous gender identification&quot; was a characteristic not just of Ishtar herself but of a category of deities he refers to as &quot;Ishtar type&quot; goddesses (such as Shaushka, Pinikir or Ninsianna). A late hymn contains the phrase &quot;she [Ishtar] is Enlil, she is Ninil&quot; which might be a reference to occasionally &quot;dimorphic&quot; character of Ishtar, in addition to serving as an exaltation. A hymn to Nanaya alludes to a male aspect of Ishtar from Babylon alongside a variety of more standard descriptions. However, Ilona Zsolnay only describes Ishtar as a &quot;feminine figure who performed a masculine role&quot; in certain contexts, for example as a war deity.

==Family==
Inanna&#x27;s twin brother was Utu (known as Shamash in Akkadian), the god of the sun and justice. In Sumerian texts, Inanna and Utu are depicted as extremely close; some modern authors even perceive their relationship as bordering on incestuous. In the myth of her descent into the underworld, Inanna addresses Ereshkigal, the queen of the underworld, as her &quot;older sister,&quot; yet the two goddesses almost never appear together elsewhere in Sumerian literature and were not placed in the same category in god lists. In some Neo-Assyrian sources, Ishtar is also associated with Adad, with the relationship mirroring that between Shaushka and her brother Teshub in Hurrian mythology.

The most common tradition regarded Nanna and his wife Ningal as her parents. Examples of it are present in sources as diverse as a god list from the Early Dynastic period, a hymn of Ishme-Dagan relaying how Enlil and Ninlil bestowed Inanna&#x27;s powers upon her, a late syncretic hymn to Nanaya, and an Akkadian ritual from Hattusa. While some authors assert that in Uruk Inanna was usually regarded as the daughter of the sky god An, it is possible that references to him as her father are only referring to his status as an ancestor of Nanna and thus his daughter. In literary texts, Enlil or Enki may be addressed as her fathers but references to major gods being &quot;fathers&quot; can also be examples of the use of this word as an epithet indicating seniority.

Dumuzid (later known as Tammuz), the god of shepherds, is usually described as Inanna&#x27;s husband, but according to some interpretations Inanna&#x27;s loyalty to him is questionable; in the myth of her descent into the Underworld, she abandons Dumuzid and permits the &quot;galla&quot; demons to drag him down into the underworld as her replacement. In a different myth, &quot;The Return of Dumuzid&quot; Inanna instead mourns over Dumuzid&#x27;s death and ultimately decrees that he will be allowed to return to Heaven to be with her for one half of the year. Dina Katz notes that the portrayal of their relationship in Inanna&#x27;s Descent is unusual; it does not resemble the portrayal of their relationship in other myths about Dumuzi&#x27;s death, which almost never pin the blame for it on Inanna, but rather on demons or even human bandits. A large corpus of love poetry describing encounters between Inanna and Dumuzi has been assembled by researchers. However, local manifestations of Inanna/Ishtar were not necessarily associated with Dumuzi. In Kish, the tutelary deity of the city, Zababa (a war god), was viewed as the consort of a local hypostasis of Ishtar, though after the Old Babylonian period Bau, introduced from Lagash, became his spouse (an example of a couple consisting out of a warrior god and a medicine goddess, common in Mesopotamian mythology) and Ishtar of Kish started to instead be worshipped on her own.

Inanna is not usually described as having any offspring; however, in the myth of Lugalbanda, as well as in a single building inscription from the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112 – 2004 BCE), the warrior god Shara is described as her son. She was also sometimes considered the mother of Lulal, who is described in other texts as the son of Ninsun. Wilfred G. Lambert described the relation between Inanna and Lulal as &quot;close but unspecified&quot; in the context of Inanna&#x27;s Descent. There is also similarly scarce evidence for the love goddess Nanaya being regarded as her daughter, but it is possible all of these instances merely refer to an epithet indicating closeness between the deities and were not a statement about actual parentage.

=== Sukkal ===

Inanna&#x27;s &quot;sukkal&quot; was the goddess Ninshubur, whose relationship with Inanna is one of mutual devotion. In some texts, Ninshubur is listed right after Dumuzi as a member of Inanna&#x27;s circle, even before some of her relatives; in one text the phrase &quot;Ninshubur, beloved vizier&quot; appears. In another text Ninshubur is listed even before Nanaya, originally possibly a hypostasis of Inanna herself, in a list of deities from her entourage. In an Akkadian ritual text known from Hittite archives, Ishtar&#x27;s &quot;sukkal&quot; is invoked alongside her family members Sin, Ningal, and Shamash.

Other members of Inanna&#x27;s entourage frequently listed in god lists are the goddesses Nanaya, Kanisurra, Gazbaba, and Bizila, all of them also associated with each other in various configurations independently from this context.

== Syncretism and influence on other deities ==
In addition to the full conflation of Inanna and Ishtar during the reign of Sargon and his successors, she was syncretised with a large number of deities to a varying degree. The oldest known syncretic hymn is dedicated to Inanna, and has been dated to the Early Dynastic period. Many god lists compiled by ancient scribes contained entire &quot;Inanna group&quot; sections enumerating similar goddesses, and tablet IV of the monumental god list &quot;An-Anum&quot; (7 tablets total) is known as the &quot;Ishtar tablet&quot; due to most of its contents being the names of Ishtar&#x27;s equivalents, her titles and various attendants. Some modern researchers use the term &quot;Ishtar-type&quot; to define specific figures of this variety. Some texts contained references to &quot;all the Ishtars&quot; of a given area.

In later periods Ishtar&#x27;s name was sometimes used as a generic term (&quot;goddess&quot;) in Babylonia, while a logographic writing of Inanna was used to spell the title &quot;Bēltu&quot;, leading to further conflations. A possible example of such use of the name is also known from Elam, as a single Elamite inscription written in Akkadian refers to &quot;Manzat-Ishtar&quot;, which might in this context mean &quot;the goddess Manzat&quot;.

=== Specific examples ===
;Ashtart: In cities like Mari and Ebla, the Eastern and Western Semitic forms of the name (Ishtar and Ashtart) were regarded as basically interchangeable. However, the western goddess evidently lacked the astral character of Mesopotamian Ishtar. Ugaritic god lists and ritual texts equate the local Ashtart with both Ishtar and Hurrian Ishara.
;Ishara: Due to association with Ishtar, the Syrian goddess Ishara started to be regarded as a &quot;lady of love&quot; like her (and Nanaya) in Mesopotamia. However, in Hurro-Hittite context Ishara was associated with the underworld goddess Allani instead and additionally functioned as a goddess of oaths.
;Nanaya: A goddess uniquely closely linked to Inanna, as according to assyriologist Frans Wiggermann her name was originally an epithet of Inanna (possibly serving as an appellative, &quot;My Inanna!&quot;). Nanaya was associated with erotic love, but she eventually developed a warlike aspect of her own too (&quot;Nanaya Euršaba&quot;). In Larsa Inanna&#x27;s functions were effectively split between three separate figures and she was worshipped as part of a trinity consisting out of herself, Nanaya (as a love goddess) and Ninsianna (as an astral goddess). Inanna/Ishtar and Nanaya were often accidentally or intentionally conflated in poetry.
;Ninegal: While she was initially an independent figure, starting with Old Babylonian period in some texts &quot;Ninegal&quot; is used as a title of Inanna, and in god lists she was a part of the &quot;Inanna group&quot; usually alongside Ninsianna. An example of the usage of &quot;Ninegal&quot; as an epithet can be found in the text designated as Hymn to Inana as Ninegala (Inana D) in the ETCSL.
;Ninisina: A special case of syncretism was that between the medicine goddess Ninisina and Inanna, which occurred for political reasons. Isin at one point lost control over Uruk and identification of its tutelary goddess with Inanna (complete with assigning a similar warlike character to her), who served as a source of royal power, was likely meant to serve as a theological solution of this problem. As a result, in a number of sources Ninisina was regarded as analogous to similarly named Ninsianna, treated as a manifestation of Inanna. It is also possible that a ceremony of &quot;sacred marriage&quot; between Ninisina and the king of Isin had been performed as a result. 
;Ninsianna: A Venus deity of varying gender. Ninsianna was referred to as male by Rim-Sin of Larsa (who specifically used the phrase &quot;my king&quot;) and in texts from Sippar, Ur, and Girsu, but as &quot;Ishtar of the stars&quot; in god lists and astronomical texts, which also applied Ishtar&#x27;s epithets related to her role as a personification of Venus to this deity. In some locations Ninsianna was also known as a female deity, in which case her name can be understood as &quot;red queen of heaven&quot;.
;Pinikir: Originally an Elamite goddess, recognised in Mesopotamia, and as a result among Hurrians and Hittites, as an equivalent of Ishtar due to similar functions. She was identified specifically as her astral aspect (Ninsianna) in god lists. In a Hittite ritual she was identified by the logogram dIŠTAR and Shamash, Suen and Ningal were referred to as her family; Enki and Ishtar&#x27;s sukkal were invoked in it as well. in Elam she was a goddess of love and sex and a heavenly deity (&quot;mistress of heaven&quot;). Due to syncretism with Ishtar and Ninsianna Pinikir was referred to as both a female and male deity in Hurro-Hittite sources.
;Šauška: Her name was frequently written with the logogram dIŠTAR in Hurrian and Hittite sources, while Mesopotamian texts recognised her under the name &quot;Ishtar of Subartu&quot;. Some elements peculiar to her were associated with the Assyrian hypostasis of Ishtar, Ishtar of Nineveh, in later times. Her handmaidens Ninatta and Kulitta were incorporated into the circle of deities believed to serve Ishtar in her temple in Ashur.

== Sumerian texts ==
=== Origin myths ===
The poem &quot;Enki and the World Order&quot; (ETCSL 1.1.3) begins by describing the god Enki and his establishment of the cosmic organization of the universe. Towards the end of the poem, Inanna comes to Enki and complains that he has assigned a domain and special powers to all of the other gods except for her. She declares that she has been treated unfairly. Enki responds by telling her that she already has a domain and that he does not need to assign her one.

The myth of &quot;Inanna and the &quot;Huluppu&quot; Tree&quot;, found in the preamble to the epic of &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot; (ETCSL 1.8.1.4), centers around a young Inanna, not yet stable in her power. It begins with a &quot;huluppu&quot; tree, which Kramer identifies as possibly a willow, growing on the banks of the river Euphrates. Inanna moves the tree to her garden in Uruk with the intention to carve it into a throne once it is fully grown. The tree grows and matures, but the serpent &quot;who knows no charm&quot;, the &quot;Anzû&quot;-bird, and &quot;Lilitu&quot; (Ki-Sikil-Lil-La-Ke in Sumerian), seen by some as the Sumerian forerunner to the Lilith of Jewish folklore, all take up residence within the tree, causing Inanna to cry with sorrow. The hero Gilgamesh, who, in this story, is portrayed as her brother, comes along and slays the serpent, causing the &quot;Anzû&quot;-bird and Lilitu to flee. Gilgamesh&#x27;s companions chop down the tree and carve its wood into a bed and a throne, which they give to Inanna, who fashions a &quot;pikku&quot; and a &quot;mikku&quot; (probably a drum and drumsticks respectively, although the exact identifications are uncertain), which she gives to Gilgamesh as a reward for his heroism.

The Sumerian hymn &quot;Inanna and Utu&quot; contains an etiological myth describing how Inanna became the goddess of sex. At the beginning of the hymn, Inanna knows nothing of sex, so she begs her brother Utu to take her to Kur (the Sumerian underworld), so that she may taste the fruit of a tree that grows there, which will reveal to her all the secrets of sex. Utu complies and, in Kur, Inanna tastes the fruit and becomes knowledgeable. The hymn employs the same motif found in the myth of &quot;Enki and Ninhursag&quot; and in the later Biblical story of Adam and Eve.

The poem &quot;Inanna Prefers the Farmer&quot; (ETCSL 4.0.8.3.3) begins with a rather playful conversation between Inanna and Utu, who incrementally reveals to her that it is time for her to marry. She is courted by a farmer named Enkimdu and a shepherd named Dumuzid. At first, Inanna prefers the farmer, but Utu and Dumuzid gradually persuade her that Dumuzid is the better choice for a husband, arguing that, for every gift the farmer can give to her, the shepherd can give her something even better. In the end, Inanna marries Dumuzid. The shepherd and the farmer reconcile their differences, offering each other gifts. Samuel Noah Kramer compares the myth to the later Biblical story of Cain and Abel because both myths center around a farmer and a shepherd competing for divine favor and, in both stories, the deity in question ultimately chooses the shepherd.

===Conquests and patronage===
&quot;Inanna and Enki&quot; (ETCSL t.1.3.1) is a lengthy poem written in Sumerian, which may date to the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112 BCE – c. 2004 BCE); it tells the story of how Inanna stole the sacred &quot;mes&quot; from Enki, the god of water and human culture. In ancient Sumerian mythology, the &quot;mes&quot; were sacred powers or properties belonging to the gods that allowed human civilization to exist. Each &quot;me&quot; embodied one specific aspect of human culture. These aspects were very diverse and the &quot;mes&quot; listed in the poem include abstract concepts such as Truth, Victory, and Counsel, technologies such as writing and weaving, and also social constructs such as law, priestly offices, kingship, and prostitution. The &quot;mes&quot; were believed to grant power over all the aspects of civilization, both positive and negative.

In the myth, Inanna travels from her own city of Uruk to Enki&#x27;s city of Eridu, where she visits his temple, the E-Abzu. Inanna is greeted by Enki&#x27;s &quot;sukkal&quot;, Isimud, who offers her food and drink. Inanna starts up a drinking competition with Enki. Then, once Enki is thoroughly intoxicated, Inanna persuades him to give her the &quot;mes&quot;. Inanna flees from Eridu in the Boat of Heaven, taking the &quot;mes&quot; back with her to Uruk. Enki wakes up to discover that the mes are gone and asks Isimud what has happened to them. Isimud replies that Enki has given all of them to Inanna. Enki becomes infuriated and sends multiple sets of fierce monsters after Inanna to take back the &quot;mes&quot; before she reaches the city of Uruk. Inanna&#x27;s &quot;sukkal&quot; Ninshubur fends off all of the monsters that Enki sends after them. Through Ninshubur&#x27;s aid, Inanna successfully manages to take the &quot;mes&quot; back with her to the city of Uruk. After Inanna escapes, Enki reconciles with her and bids her a positive farewell. It is possible that this legend may represent a historic transfer of power from the city of Eridu to the city of Uruk. It is also possible that this legend may be a symbolic representation of Inanna&#x27;s maturity and her readiness to become the Queen of Heaven.

The poem &quot;Inanna Takes Command of Heaven&quot; is an extremely fragmentary, but important, account of Inanna&#x27;s conquest of the Eanna temple in Uruk. It begins with a conversation between Inanna and her brother Utu in which Inanna laments that the Eanna temple is not within their domain and resolves to claim it as her own. The text becomes increasingly fragmentary at this point in the narrative, but appears to describe her difficult passage through a marshland to reach the temple while a fisherman instructs her on which route is best to take. Ultimately, Inanna reaches her father An, who is shocked by her arrogance, but nevertheless concedes that she has succeeded and that the temple is now her domain. The text ends with a hymn expounding Inanna&#x27;s greatness. This myth may represent an eclipse in the authority of the priests of An in Uruk and a transfer of power to the priests of Inanna. Beside the epic text, the descent of the Eanna from heaven is mentioned in the story of &quot;Gilgameš and Akka&quot; (line 31) as well as the Sumerian &quot;Temple hymns&quot; and the bilingual text &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna/Ištar&quot;.

Inanna briefly appears at the beginning and end of the epic poem &quot;Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta&quot; (ETCSL 1.8.2.3). The epic deals with a rivalry between the cities of Uruk and Aratta. Enmerkar, the king of Uruk, wishes to adorn his city with jewels and precious metals, but cannot do so because such minerals are only found in Aratta and, since trade does not yet exist, the resources are not available to him. Inanna, who is the patron goddess of both cities, appears to Enmerkar at the beginning of the poem and tells him that she favors Uruk over Aratta. She instructs Enmerkar to send a messenger to the lord of Aratta to ask for the resources Uruk needs. The majority of the epic revolves around a great contest between the two kings over Inanna&#x27;s favor. Inanna reappears at the end of the poem to resolve the conflict by telling Enmerkar to establish trade between his city and Aratta.

=== Justice myths ===
Inanna and her brother Utu were regarded as the dispensers of divine justice, a role which Inanna exemplifies in several of her myths. &quot;Inanna and Ebih&quot; (ETCSL 1.3.2), otherwise known as &quot;Goddess of the Fearsome Divine Powers&quot;, is a 184-line poem written by the Akkadian poet Enheduanna describing Inanna&#x27;s confrontation with Mount Ebih, a mountain in the Zagros mountain range. The poem begins with an introductory hymn praising Inanna. The goddess journeys all over the entire world, until she comes across Mount Ebih and becomes infuriated by its glorious might and natural beauty, considering its very existence as an outright affront to her own authority. She rails at Mount Ebih, shouting:

Inanna petitions to An, the Sumerian god of the heavens, to allow her to destroy Mount Ebih. An warns Inanna not to attack the mountain, but she ignores his warning and proceeds to attack and destroy Mount Ebih regardless. In the conclusion of the myth, she explains to Mount Ebih why she attacked it. In Sumerian poetry, the phrase &quot;destroyer of Kur&quot; is occasionally used as one of Inanna&#x27;s epithets. According to Annette Zgoll, in this text Inanna represents the expansive conquest policy of the Akkadian empire, while the reluctant behaviour of the god An represents the perspective of the land of Sumer and its inhabitants, who had to suffer under the Sargonid invasions. The rebellion of the mountain of Ebiḫ and its destruction by Inanna is also mentioned in the hymn &quot;Innin ša gura&quot; (&quot;Mistress of the Great Heart&quot;), which is ascribed to the high priestess En-ḫedu-ana.

The poem &quot;Inanna and Shukaletuda&quot; (ETCSL 1.3.3) begins with a hymn to Inanna, praising her as the planet Venus. It then introduces Shukaletuda, a gardener who is terrible at his job. All of his plants die, except for one poplar tree. Shukaletuda prays to the gods for guidance in his work. To his surprise, the goddess Inanna sees his one poplar tree and decides to rest under the shade of its branches. Shukaletuda removes her clothes and rapes Inanna while she sleeps. When the goddess wakes up and realizes she has been violated, she becomes furious and determines to bring her attacker to justice. In a fit of rage, Inanna unleashes horrible plagues upon the Earth, turning water into blood. Shukaletuda, terrified for his life, pleads his father for advice on how to escape Inanna&#x27;s wrath. His father tells him to hide in the city, amongst the hordes of people, where he will hopefully blend in. Inanna searches the mountains of the East for her attacker, but is not able to find him. She then releases a series of storms and closes all roads to the city, but is still unable to find Shukaletuda, so she asks Enki to help her find him, threatening to leave her temple in Uruk if he does not. Enki consents and Inanna flies &quot;across the sky like a rainbow&quot;. Inanna finally locates Shukaletuda, who vainly attempts to invent excuses for his crime against her. Inanna rejects these excuses and kills him. Theology professor Jeffrey Cooley has cited the story of Shukaletuda as a Sumerian astral myth, arguing that the movements of Inanna in the story correspond with the movements of the planet Venus. He has also stated that, while Shukaletuda was praying to the goddess, he may have been looking toward Venus on the horizon.

The text of the poem &quot;Inanna and Bilulu&quot; (ETCSL 1.4.4), discovered at Nippur, is badly mutilated and scholars have interpreted it in a number of different ways. The beginning of the poem is mostly destroyed, but seems to be a lament. The intelligible part of the poem describes Inanna pining after her husband Dumuzid, who is in the steppe watching his flocks. Inanna sets out to find him. After this, a large portion of the text is missing. When the story resumes, Inanna is being told that Dumuzid has been murdered. Inanna discovers that the old bandit woman Bilulu and her son Girgire are responsible. She travels along the road to Edenlila and stops at an inn, where she finds the two murderers. Inanna stands on top of a stool and transforms Bilulu into &quot;the waterskin that men carry in the desert&quot;, forcing her to pour the funerary libations for Dumuzid.

==Descent into the underworld==
Two different versions of the story of Inanna/Ishtar&#x27;s descent into the underworld have survived: a Sumerian version dating to the Third Dynasty of Ur (circa 2112 BCE – 2004 BCE) (ETCSL 1.4.1) and a clearly derivative Akkadian version from the early second millennium BCE. The Sumerian version of the story is nearly three times the length of the later Akkadian version and contains much greater detail.

Various other texts refer to the myth of Inanna&#x27;s descent as well, including the tale of &quot;Inanna and Šukaletuda&quot;.  Already in the first cuneiform texts of late 4th millennium Uruk period, the divine name &quot;Inanna-kur&quot; &quot;Inanna (of the) netherworld&quot; is attested, which probably refers to the underworld passage and thus makes it probably the oldest reliably attested myth of mankind.

===Sumerian version===

In Sumerian religion, the &quot;Kur&quot; or underworld was ruled by the goddess Ereshkigal, the &quot;sister&quot; of Inanna. The text itself does not explicitly state the motivation of Inanna&#x27;s descent. However, hylistic myth research could show that at least one variant of the myth processed in the text relates to Inanna demanding the &quot;me&quot; (divine powers/rituals) of the netherworld, in which she finally succeeds.

Before leaving, Inanna instructs her minister and servant Ninshubur to plead with the deities Enlil, Nanna, An, and Enki to rescue her if she does not return after three days. The laws of the underworld dictate that, with the exception of appointed messengers, those who enter it may never leave. Inanna dresses elaborately for the visit; she wears a turban, wig, lapis lazuli necklace, beads upon her breast, the &quot;&#x27;pala&quot; dress&#x27; (the ladyship garment), mascara, a pectoral, and golden ring, and holds a lapis lazuli measuring rod. Each garment is a representation of a powerful &quot;me&quot; she possesses.

Inanna pounds on the gates of the underworld, demanding to be let in. The gatekeeper Neti asks her why she has come and Inanna replies that she wishes to attend the funeral rites of Gugalanna, the &quot;husband of my elder sister Ereshkigal&quot;. Neti reports this to Ereshkigal, who tells him: &quot;Bolt the seven gates of the underworld. Then, one by one, open each gate a crack. Let Inanna enter. As she enters, remove her royal garments.&quot; Perhaps Inanna&#x27;s garments, unsuitable for a funeral, along with Inanna&#x27;s haughty behavior, make Ereshkigal suspicious. Following Ereshkigal&#x27;s instructions, Neti tells Inanna she may enter the first gate of the underworld, but she must hand over her lapis lazuli measuring rod. She asks why, and is told, &quot;It is just the ways of the underworld.&quot; She obliges and passes through. Inanna passes through a total of seven gates, at each one removing a piece of clothing or jewelry she had been wearing at the start of her journey, thus stripping her of her power. When she arrives in front of her sister, she is naked:

Three days and three nights pass, and Ninshubur, following instructions, goes to the temples of Enlil, Nanna, An, and Enki, and pleads with each of them to rescue Inanna. The first three deities refuse, saying Inanna&#x27;s fate is her own fault, but Enki is deeply troubled and agrees to help. He creates two sexless figures named &quot;gala-tura&quot; and the &quot;kur-jara&quot; from the dirt under the fingernails of two of his fingers. He instructs them to appease Ereshkigal and, when she asks them what they want, ask for the corpse of Inanna, which they must sprinkle with the food and water of life. When they come before Ereshkigal, she is in agony like a woman giving birth. She offers them whatever they want, including life-giving rivers of water and fields of grain, if they can relieve her, but they refuse all of her offers and ask only for Inanna&#x27;s corpse. The &quot;gala-tura&quot; and the &quot;kur-jara&quot; sprinkle Inanna&#x27;s corpse with the food and water of life and revive her. 

The Sumerian text connects the myth of Inanna&#x27;s descent with one variant of the myth concerning the death of Dumuzi: &quot;Galla&quot; demons sent by Ereshkigal follow Inanna out of the underworld, insisting that someone else must be taken to the underworld as Inanna&#x27;s replacement. They first come upon Ninshubur and attempt to take her, but Inanna stops them, insisting that Ninshubur is her loyal servant and that she had rightfully mourned for her while she was in the underworld. They next come upon Shara, Inanna&#x27;s beautician, who is still in mourning. The demons attempt to take him, but Inanna insists that they may not, because he had also mourned for her. The third person they come upon is Lulal, who is also in mourning. The demons try to take him, but Inanna stops them once again. 

Finally, they come upon Dumuzi, Inanna&#x27;s husband. Despite Inanna&#x27;s fate, and in contrast to the other individuals who were properly mourning her, Dumuzi is lavishly clothed and resting beneath a tree, or upon her throne, entertained by slave-girls. Inanna, displeased, decrees that the &quot;galla&quot; shall take him. The &quot;galla&quot; then drag Dumuzi down to the underworld. 

Another text known as &quot;Dumuzi&#x27;s Dream&quot; (ETCSL 1.4.3) describes Dumuzi&#x27;s repeated attempts to evade capture by the &quot;galla&quot; demons, an effort in which he is aided by the sun-god Utu. In the Sumerian poem &quot;The Return of Dumuzid&quot;, which begins where &quot;The Dream of Dumuzid&quot; ends, Dumuzid&#x27;s sister Geshtinanna laments continually for days and nights over Dumuzid&#x27;s death, joined by Inanna, who has apparently experienced a change of heart, and Sirtur, Dumuzid&#x27;s mother. The three goddesses mourn continually until a fly reveals to Inanna the location of her husband. Together, Inanna and Geshtinanna go to the place where the fly has told them they will find Dumuzid. They find him there and Inanna decrees that, from that point onwards, Dumuzid will spend half of the year with her sister Ereshkigal in the underworld and the other half of the year in Heaven with her, while his sister Geshtinanna takes his place in the underworld.

===Akkadian version===
This version had two manuscripts found in the Library of Ashurbanipal and a third was found in Asshur, all dating from the first half of the first millennium before the common era. Of the Ninevite version, the first cuneiform version was published in 1873 by François Lenormant, and the transliterated version was published by Peter Jensen in 1901. Its title in Akkadian is &quot;Ana Kurnugê, qaqqari la târi&quot;.

The Akkadian version begins with Ishtar approaching the gates of the underworld and demanding the gatekeeper to let her in:

The gatekeeper (whose name is not given in the Akkadian version) hurries to tell Ereshkigal of Ishtar&#x27;s arrival. Ereshkigal orders him to let Ishtar enter, but tells him to &quot;treat her according to the ancient rites&quot;. The gatekeeper lets Ishtar into the underworld, opening one gate at a time. At each gate, Ishtar is forced to shed one article of clothing. When she finally passes the seventh gate, she is naked. In a rage, Ishtar throws herself at Ereshkigal, but Ereshkigal orders her servant Namtar to imprison Ishtar and unleash sixty diseases against her.

After Ishtar descends to the underworld, all sexual activity ceases on earth. The god Papsukkal, the Akkadian counterpart to Ninshubur, reports the situation to Ea, the god of wisdom and culture. Ea creates an androgynous being called Asu-shu-namir and sends them to Ereshkigal, telling them to invoke &quot;the name of the great gods&quot; against her and to ask for the bag containing the waters of life. Ereshkigal becomes enraged when she hears Asu-shu-namir&#x27;s demand, but she is forced to give them the water of life. Asu-shu-namir sprinkles Ishtar with this water, reviving her. Then, Ishtar passes back through the seven gates, receiving one article of clothing back at each gate, and exiting the final gate fully clothed. But Ištar must provide a substitute for her return to the world of the living, namely her husband Dumuzi. His sister Belili, however, takes part of the punishment upon herself, so that from now on they take turns in the underworld. Together with Dumuzi, the other dead are now allowed to leave the underworld on certain days as wellthus Ištar&#x27;s descent into the underworld has created an opportunity for people to make contact with the dead, thus founding a religious holiday.

===Interpretations in modern assyriology===

Dina Katz, an authority on Sumerian afterlife beliefs and funerary customs, considers the narrative of Inanna&#x27;s descent to be a combination of two distinct preexisting traditions rooted in broader context of Mesopotamian religion.

In one tradition, Inanna was only able to leave the underworld with the help of Enki&#x27;s trick, with no mention of the possibility of finding a substitute. This part of the myth belongs to the genre of myths about deities struggling to obtain power, glory etc. (such as Lugal-e or Enuma Elish), and possibly served as a representation of Inanna&#x27;s character as a personification of a periodically vanishing astral body. According to Katz, the fact that Inanna&#x27;s instructions to Ninshubur contain a correct prediction of her eventual fate, including the exact means of her rescue, show that the purpose of this composition was simply highlighting Inanna&#x27;s ability to traverse both the heavens and the underworld, much like how Venus was able to rise over and over again. She also points out Inanna&#x27;s return has parallels in some Udug-hul incantations.

Another was simply one of the many myths about the death of Dumuzi (such as &quot;Dumuzi&#x27;s Dream&quot; or &quot;Inana and Bilulu&quot;; in these myths Inanna is not to blame for his death), tied to his role as an embodiment of vegetation. She considers it possible that the connection between the two parts of the narrative was meant to mirror some well attested healing rituals which required a symbolic substitute of the person being treated.

Katz also notes that the Sumerian version of the myth is not concerned with matters of fertility, and points out any references to it (e.g. to nature being infertile while Ishtar is dead) were only added in later Akkadian translations; so was the description of Tammuz&#x27;s funeral. The purpose of these changes was likely to make the myth closer to cultic traditions linked to Tammuz, namely the annual mourning of his death followed by celebration of a temporary return. According to Katz it is notable that known many copies of the later versions of the myth come from Assyrian cities which were known for their veneration of Tammuz, such as Ashur and Nineveh.

===Other interpretations===
A number of less scholarly interpretations of the myth arose through the 20th century, many of them rooted in the tradition of Jungian analysis rather than assyriology. Some authors draw comparisons to the Greek myth of the abduction of Persephone as well.

Monica Otterrmann performed a feminist interpretation of the myth, questioning its interpretation as related to the cycle of nature, claiming that the narratives represent that Inanna&#x27;s powers were being restricted by the Mesopotamian patriarchy, due to the fact that, according to her, the region was not conducive to fertility. Brandão questions this idea in part, for although Inanna&#x27;s power is at stake in the Sumerian text, in the Akkadian text the goddess&#x27; relationship to fertility and fertilization is at stake. Furthermore, in the Sumerian text Inanna&#x27;s power is not limited by a man, but by another equally powerful goddess, Ereskigal.

==Later myths==
===&quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;===

In the Akkadian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Ishtar appears to Gilgamesh after he and his companion Enkidu have returned to Uruk from defeating the ogre Humbaba and demands Gilgamesh to become her consort. Gilgamesh refuses her, pointing out that all of her previous lovers have suffered:

Infuriated by Gilgamesh&#x27;s refusal, Ishtar goes to heaven and tells her father Anu that Gilgamesh has insulted her. Anu asks her why she is complaining to him instead of confronting Gilgamesh herself. Ishtar demands that Anu give her the Bull of Heaven and swears that if he does not give it to her, she will &quot;break in the doors of hell and smash the bolts; there will be confusion [i.e., mixing] of people, those above with those from the lower depths. I shall bring up the dead to eat food like the living; and the hosts of the dead will outnumber the living.&quot;

Anu gives Ishtar the Bull of Heaven, and Ishtar sends it to attack Gilgamesh and his friend Enkidu. Gilgamesh and Enkidu kill the Bull and offer its heart to the sun-god Shamash. While Gilgamesh and Enkidu are resting, Ishtar stands up on the walls of Uruk and curses Gilgamesh. Enkidu tears off the Bull&#x27;s right thigh and throws it in Ishtar&#x27;s face, saying, &quot;If I could lay my hands on you, it is this I should do to you, and lash your entrails to your side.&quot; (Enkidu later dies for this impiety.) Ishtar calls together &quot;the crimped courtesans, prostitutes and harlots&quot; and orders them to mourn for the Bull of Heaven. Meanwhile, Gilgamesh holds a celebration over the Bull of Heaven&#x27;s defeat.

Later in the epic, Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the story of the Great Flood, which was sent by the god Enlil to annihilate all life on earth because the humans, who were vastly overpopulated, made too much noise and prevented him from sleeping. Utnapishtim tells how, when the flood came, Ishtar wept and mourned over the destruction of humanity, alongside the Anunnaki. Later, after the flood subsides, Utnapishtim makes an offering to the gods. Ishtar appears to Utnapishtim wearing a lapis lazuli necklace with beads shaped like flies and tells him that Enlil never discussed the flood with any of the other gods. She swears him that she will never allow Enlil to cause another flood and declares her lapis lazuli necklace a sign of her oath. Ishtar invites all the gods except for Enlil to gather around the offering and enjoy.

=== &quot;Song of Agushaya&quot; ===
The &quot;Song of Agushaya&quot;, an Akkadian text presumably from the time of Hammurabi, tells a myth mixed with hymnic passages: the war goddess Ishtar is filled with constant wrath and plagues the earth with war and battle. With her roar, she finally even threatens the wise god Ea in Apsû. He appears before the assembly of gods and decides (similar to Enkidu in the Epic of Gilgameš) to create an equal opponent for Ishtar. From the dirt of his fingernails he forms the powerful goddess Ṣaltum (&quot;fight, quarrel&quot;), whom he instructs to confront Ishtar disrespectfully and plague her day and night with her roar. The text section with the confrontation of both goddesses is not preserved, but it is followed by a scene in which Ishtar demands from Ea to call Ṣaltum back, which he does. Subsequently, Ea establishes a festival in which henceforth a &quot;whirl dance&quot; (&quot;gūštû&quot;) is to be performed annually in commemoration of the events. The text ends with the statement that Ishtar&#x27;s heart has calmed down.

===Other tales===
A myth about the childhood of the god Ishum, viewed as a son of Shamash, describes Ishtar seemingly temporarily taking care of him, and possibly expressing annoyance at that situation.

In a pseudepigraphical Neo-Assyrian text written in the seventh century BCE, but which claims to be the autobiography of Sargon of Akkad, Ishtar is claimed to have appeared to Sargon &quot;surrounded by a cloud of doves&quot; while he was working as a gardener for Akki, the drawer of the water. Ishtar then proclaimed Sargon her lover and allowed him to become the ruler of Sumer and Akkad.

In Hurro-Hittite texts the logogram dISHTAR denotes the goddess Šauška, who was identified with Ishtar in god lists and similar documents as well and influenced the development of the late Assyrian cult of Ishtar of Nineveh according to hittitologist Gary Beckman. She plays a prominent role in the Hurrian myths of the Kumarbi cycle.

==Later influence==
===In antiquity===
The cult of Inanna/Ishtar may have been introduced to the Kingdom of Judah during the reign of King Manasseh and, although Inanna herself is not directly mentioned in the Bible by name, the Old Testament contains numerous allusions to her cult. and mention &quot;the Queen of Heaven,&quot; who is probably a syncretism of Inanna/Ishtar and the West Semitic goddess Astarte. Jeremiah states that the Queen of Heaven was worshipped by women who baked cakes for her.

The Song of Songs bears strong similarities to the Sumerian love poems involving Inanna and Dumuzid, particularly in its usage of natural symbolism to represent the lovers&#x27; physicality. mentions Inanna&#x27;s husband Dumuzid under his later East Semitic name Tammuz, and describes a group of women mourning Tammuz&#x27;s death while sitting near the north gate of the Temple in Jerusalem. Marina Warner (a literary critic rather than Assyriologist) claims that early Christians in the Middle East assimilated elements of Ishtar into the cult of the Virgin Mary. She argues that the Syrian writers Jacob of Serugh and Romanos the Melodist both wrote laments in which the Virgin Mary describes her compassion for her son at the foot of the cross in deeply personal terms closely resembling Ishtar&#x27;s laments over the death of Tammuz. However, broad comparisons between Tammuz and other dying gods are rooted in the work of James George Frazer and are regarded as a relic of less rigorous early 20th century Assyriology by more recent publications.

The cult of Inanna/Ishtar also heavily influenced the cult of the Phoenician goddess Astarte. The Phoenicians introduced Astarte to the Greek islands of Cyprus and Cythera, where she either gave rise to or at least heavily influenced the Greek goddess Aphrodite. Aphrodite took on Inanna/Ishtar&#x27;s associations with sexuality and procreation. Furthermore, Aphrodite was known as Ourania (Οὐρανία), meaning &quot;heavenly,&quot; corresponding to Inanna&#x27;s role as the Queen of Heaven.

Early artistic and literary portrayals of Aphrodite are extremely similar to Inanna/Ishtar. Aphrodite was also a warrior goddess; the second-century AD Greek geographer Pausanias records that, in Sparta, Aphrodite was worshipped as &quot;Aphrodite Areia&quot;, which means &quot;warlike.&quot; He also mentions that Aphrodite&#x27;s most ancient cult statues in Sparta and on Cythera showed her bearing arms. Modern scholars note that Aphrodite&#x27;s warrior-goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship and see it as an indication of her Near Eastern origins. Aphrodite also absorbed Ishtar&#x27;s association with doves, which were sacrificed to her alone. The Greek word for &quot;dove&quot; was &quot;peristerá&quot;, which may be derived from the Semitic phrase &quot;peraḥ Ištar&quot;, meaning &quot;bird of Ishtar.&quot; The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis is derived from the story of Inanna and Dumuzid.

Classical scholar Charles Penglase has written that Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and war, resembles Inanna&#x27;s role as a &quot;terrifying warrior goddess.&quot; Others have noted that the birth of Athena from the head of her father Zeus could be derived from Inanna&#x27;s descent into and return from the Underworld. However, as noted by Gary Beckman, a rather direct parallel to Athena&#x27;s birth is found in the Hurrian Kumarbi cycle, where Teshub is born from the surgically split skull of Kumarbi, rather than in any Inanna myths.

In Mandaean cosmology, one of the names for Venus is &quot;ʿStira&quot;, which is derived from the name Ishtar.

Anthropologist Kevin Tuite argues that the Georgian goddess Dali was also influenced by Inanna, noting that both Dali and Inanna were associated with the morning star, both were characteristically depicted nude, (but Assyriologists assume the &quot;naked goddess&quot; motif in Mesopotamian art in most cases cannot be Ishtar, and the goddess most consistently depicted as naked was Shala, a weather goddess unrelated to Ishtar) both were associated with gold jewelry, both sexually preyed on mortal men, both were associated with human and animal fertility, (note however that Assyriologist Dina Katz pointed out the references to fertility are more likely to be connected to Dumuzi than Inanna/Ishtar in at least some cases) and both had ambiguous natures as sexually attractive, but dangerous, women.

Traditional Mesopotamian religion gradually began to decline between the third and fifth centuries AD as ethnic Assyrians converted to Christianity. Nonetheless, the cult of Ishtar and Tammuz managed to survive in parts of Upper Mesopotamia. In the tenth century AD, an Arab traveler wrote that &quot;All the Sabaeans of our time, those of Babylonia as well as those of Harran, lament and weep to this day over Tammuz at a festival which they, more particularly the women, hold in the month of the same name.&quot;

Worship of Venus deities possibly connected to Inanna/Ishtar was known in Pre-Islamic Arabia right up until the Islamic period. Isaac of Antioch (d. 406 AD) said that the Arabs worshipped &#x27;the Star&#x27; (&quot;kawkabta&quot;), also known as Al-Uzza, which many identify with Venus. Isaac also mentions an Arabian deity named Baltis, which according to Jan Retsö most likely was another designation for Ishtar. In pre-Islamic Arabian inscriptions themselves, it appears that the deity known as Allat was also a Venusian deity. Attar, a male god whose name is a cognate of Ishtar&#x27;s, is a plausible candidate for the role of Arabian Venus deity too on the account of both his name and his epithet &quot;eastern and western&quot;.

===Modern relevance===
In his 1853 pamphlet &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;, as part of his argument that Roman Catholicism is actually Babylonian paganism in disguise, Alexander Hislop, a Protestant minister in the Free Church of Scotland, incorrectly argued that the modern English word &quot;Easter&quot; must be derived from &quot;Ishtar&quot; due to the phonetic similarity of the two words. Modern scholars have unanimously rejected Hislop&#x27;s arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of Babylonian religion. Nonetheless, Hislop&#x27;s book is still popular among some groups of evangelical Protestants and the ideas promoted in it have become widely circulated, especially through the Internet, due to a number of popular Internet memes.

Ishtar had a major appearance in &quot;Ishtar and Izdubar&quot;, a book-length poem written in 1884 by Leonidas Le Cenci Hamilton, an American lawyer and businessman, loosely based on the recently translated &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;. &quot;Ishtar and Izdubar&quot; expanded the original roughly 3,000 lines of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; to roughly 6,000 lines of rhyming couplets grouped into forty-eight cantos. Hamilton significantly altered most of the characters and introduced entirely new episodes not found in the original epic. Significantly influenced by Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; and Edwin Arnold&#x27;s &quot;The Light of Asia&quot;, Hamilton&#x27;s characters dress more like nineteenth-century Turks than ancient Babylonians. In the poem, Izdubar (the earlier misreading for the name &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;) falls in love with Ishtar, but, then, &quot;with hot and balmy breath, and trembling form aglow&quot;, she attempts to seduce him, leading Izdubar to reject her advances. Several &quot;columns&quot; of the book are devoted to an account of Ishtar&#x27;s descent into the Underworld. At the conclusion of the book, Izdubar, now a god, is reconciled with Ishtar in Heaven. In 1887, the composer Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote &quot;Symphony Ishtar, variations symphonique, Op. 42&quot;, a symphony inspired by the Assyrian monuments in the British Museum.

Inanna has become an important figure in modern feminist theory because she appears in the male-dominated Sumerian pantheon, but is equally as powerful, if not more powerful than, the male deities she appears alongside. Simone de Beauvoir, in her book &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949), argues that Inanna, along with other powerful female deities from antiquity, have been marginalized by modern culture in favor of male deities. Tikva Frymer-Kensky has argued that Inanna was a &quot;marginal figure&quot; in Sumerian religion who embodies the &quot;socially unacceptable&quot; archetype of the &quot;undomesticated, unattached woman&quot;. Feminist author Johanna Stuckey has argued against this idea, pointing out Inanna&#x27;s centrality in Sumerian religion and her broad diversity of powers, neither of which seem to fit the idea that she was in any way regarded as &quot;marginal&quot;. Assyriologist Julia M. Asher-Greve, who specializes in the study of position of women in antiquity, criticizes Frymer-Kensky&#x27;s studies of Mesopotamian religion as a whole, highlighting the problems with her focus on fertility, the small selection of sources her works relied on, her view that position of goddesses in the pantheon reflected that of ordinary women in society (so-called &quot;mirror theory&quot;), as well as the fact her works do not accurately reflect the complexity of changes of roles of goddesses in religions of ancient Mesopotamia. Ilona Zsolnay regards Frymer-Kensky&#x27;s methodology as faulty.

Inanna is also an important figure in BDSM culture. The portrayal of Inanna in the Inanna and Ebih myth is cited as a precursor example of the dominatrix archetype, characterizing her as a powerful woman who forces gods and men to submit to her. In mythology, Inanna&#x27;s submissives danced in rituals while being whipped by her to satisfy her. When submissives asked for &quot;mercy&quot;, Inanna ended the flagellation, making such an action the pioneer of the BDSM safeword concept.

====In Neopaganism and Sumerian reconstructionism====
Inanna is the primary ancient source for Aleister Crowley&#x27;s Babalon, a principal goddess in the religion Thelema. Inanna&#x27;s name is also used to refer to the Goddess in modern Neopaganism and Wicca. Her name occurs in the refrain of the &quot;Burning Times Chant,&quot; one of the most widely used Wiccan liturgies. &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent into the Underworld&quot; was the inspiration for the &quot;Descent of the Goddess,&quot; one of the most popular texts of Gardnerian Wicca.

== In popular culture ==
Ishtar is a key figure in the novel &quot;The Ship of Ishtar&quot; by A. Merritt.

Inanna is the protagonist of &quot;Star Dancer&quot; (1993), a fantasy novel by Fay Sampson. 

In the Kurdish feature film, &quot;Where Is Gilgamesh?&quot; (2024) based on the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, Innana appears as a rival of Gilgamesh and a protector of an ancient hidden secret written on a Sumerian tablet.

<text>Archilochus (; &quot;Arkhílokhos&quot;; 680 – c. 645 BC) was a Greek lyric poet of the Archaic period from the island of Paros. He is celebrated for his versatile and innovative use of poetic meters, and is the earliest known Greek author to compose almost entirely on the theme of his own emotions and experiences.

==Biography==

A considerable amount of information about the life of Archilochus has come down to the modern age via his surviving work, the testimony of other authors, and inscriptions on monuments, yet it all needs to be viewed with caution – the biographical tradition is generally unreliable and the fragmentary nature of the poems does not really support inferences about his personal history. The vivid language and intimate details of the poems often look autobiographical yet it is known, on the authority of Aristotle, that Archilochus sometimes role-played. The philosopher quoted two fragments as examples of an author speaking in somebody else&#x27;s voice: in one, an unnamed father commenting on a recent eclipse of the sun and, in the other, a carpenter named Charon, expressing his indifference to the wealth of Gyges, the king of Lydia. There is nothing in those two fragments to suggest that Archilochus is speaking in those roles (we rely entirely on Aristotle for the context) and possibly many of his other verses involved role-playing too. It has even been suggested by one modern scholar that imaginary characters and situations might have been a feature of the poetic tradition within which Archilochus composed, known by the ancients as iambus.

The two poems quoted by Aristotle help to date the poet&#x27;s life (assuming of course that Charon and the unnamed father are speaking about events that Archilochus had experienced himself). Gyges reigned 687–652 BC and the date of the eclipse must have been either 6 April 648 BC or 27 June 660 BC (another date, 14 March 711 BC, is generally considered too early). These dates are consistent with other evidence of the poet&#x27;s chronology and reported history, such as the discovery at Thasos of a cenotaph, dated around the end of the seventh century and dedicated to a friend named in several fragments: Glaucus, son of Leptines. The chronology for Archilochus is complex but modern scholars generally settle for c. 680 – c. 640 BC.

Whether or not their lives had been virtuous, authors of genius were revered by their fellow Greeks. Thus a sanctuary to Archilochus (the &quot;Archilocheion&quot;) was established on his home island Paros sometime in the third century BC, where his admirers offered him sacrifices, as well as to gods such as Apollo, Dionysus, and the Muses. Inscriptions found on orthostats from the sanctuary include quoted verses and historical records. In one, we are told that his father Telesicles once sent Archilochus to fetch a cow from the fields, but that the boy chanced to meet a group of women who soon vanished with the animal and left him a lyre in its place – they were the Muses and they had thus earmarked him as their protégé. According to the same inscription, the omen was later confirmed by the oracle at Delphi. Not all the inscriptions are as fanciful as that. Some are records by a local historian of the time, set out in chronological order according to custom, under the names of archons. Unfortunately, these are very fragmentary.
Snippets of biographical information are provided by ancient authors as diverse as Tatian, Proclus, Clement of Alexandria, Cicero, Aelian, Plutarch, Galen, Dio Chrysostom, Aelius Aristides and several anonymous authors in the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;. According to tradition, Archilochus was born to a notable family on Paros. His grandfather (or great-grandfather), Tellis, helped establish the cult of Demeter on Thasos near the end of the eighth century BC, a mission that was famously depicted in a painting at Delphi by the Thasian Polygnotus. The painting, later described by Pausanias, showed Tellis in Hades, sharing Charon&#x27;s boat with the priestess of Demeter. The poet&#x27;s father, Telesicles, also distinguished himself in the history of Thasos, as the founder of a Parian colony there. The names &#x27;Tellis&#x27; and &#x27;Telesicles&#x27; can have religious connotations and some modern scholars infer that the poet was born into a priestly family devoted to Demeter. Inscriptions in the &quot;Archilocheion&quot; identify Archilochus as a key figure in the Parian cult of Dionysus There is no evidence to back isolated reports that his mother was a slave, named Enipo, that he left Paros to escape poverty, or that he became a mercenary soldier – the slave background is probably inferred from a misreading of his verses; archaeology indicates that life on Paros, which he associated with &quot;figs and seafaring&quot;, was quite prosperous; and though he frequently refers to the rough life of a soldier, warfare was a function of the aristocracy in the archaic period and there is no indication that he fought for pay.
The life of Archilochus was marked by conflicts. The ancient tradition identified a Parian, Lycambes, and his daughters as the main target of his anger. The father is said to have betrothed his daughter, Neobule, to Archilochus, but reneged on the agreement, and the poet retaliated with such eloquent abuse that Lycambes, Neobule and one or both of his other daughters committed suicide. The story later became a popular theme for Alexandrian versifiers, who played upon its poignancy at the expense of Archilochus. Some modern scholars believe that Lycambes and his daughters were not actually the poet&#x27;s contemporaries but fictional characters in a traditional entertainment. According to another view, Lycambes as an oath-breaker had marked himself out as a menace to society and the poet&#x27;s invective was not just personal revenge but a social obligation consistent with the practice of &#x27;iambos&#x27;.

The inscriptions in the &quot;Archilocheion&quot; imply that the poet had a controversial role in the introduction of the cult of Dionysus to Paros. It records that his songs were condemned by the Parians as &quot;too iambic&quot; (the issue may have concerned phallic worship) but they were the ones who ended up being punished by the gods for impiety, possibly with impotence. The oracle of Apollo then instructed them to atone for their error and rid themselves of their suffering by honouring the poet, which led to the shrine being dedicated to him. His hero cult lasted on Paros over 800 years.

His combative spirit also expressed itself in warfare. He joined the Parian colony on Thasos and battled the indigenous Thracians, expressing himself in his poems as a cynical, hard-bitten soldier fighting for a country he doesn&#x27;t love (&quot;Thasos, thrice miserable city&quot;) on behalf of a people he scorns yet he values his closest comrades and their stalwart, unglamorous commander. Later he returned to Paros and joined the fight against the neighbouring island of Naxos. A Naxian warrior named Calondas won notoriety as the man that killed him. The Naxian&#x27;s fate interested later authors such as Plutarch and Dio Chrysostom, since it had been a fair fight yet he was punished for it by the gods: He had gone to the temple of Apollo at Delphi to consult the oracle and was rebuked with the memorable words: &quot;You killed the servant of the Muses; depart from the temple.&quot;

=== The poet&#x27;s character ===

This couplet testifies to a social revolution: Homer&#x27;s poetry was a powerful influence on later poets and yet in Homer&#x27;s day it had been unthinkable for a poet to be a warrior. Archilochus deliberately broke the traditional mould even while adapting himself to it. &quot;Perhaps there is a special relevance to his times in the particular gestures he elects to make: The abandonment of grandly heroic attitudes in favour of a new unsentimental honesty, an iconoclastic and flippant tone of voice coupled with deep awareness of traditional truths.&quot;

Ancient authors and scholars often reacted to his poetry and to the biographical tradition angrily, condemning &quot;fault-finding Archilochus&quot; for &quot;fattening himself on harsh words of hatred&quot; (see Pindar&#x27;s comment below) and for &quot;the unseemly and lewd utterances directed towards women&quot;, whereby he made &quot;a spectacle of himself&quot; He was considered &quot;a noble poet in other respects if one were to take away his foul mouth and slanderous speech and wash them away like a stain&quot; (Suda). According to Valerius Maximus, the Spartans banished the works of Archilochus from their state for the sake of their children &quot;lest it harm their morals more than it benefited their talents.&quot; Yet some ancient scholars interpreted his motives more sympathetically:
==Poetry==
The earliest meter in extant Greek poetry was the epic hexameter of Homer. Homer did not create the epic hexameter, however, and there is evidence that other meters also predate his work. Thus, though ancient scholars credited Archilochus with the invention of elegy and iambic poetry, he probably built on a &quot;flourishing tradition of popular song&quot; that pre-dated Homer. His innovations however seem to have turned a popular tradition into an important literary medium. His merits as a poet were neatly summarized by the rhetorician Quintilian:

Most ancient commentators focused on his lampoons and on the virulence of his invective, yet the extant verses (most of which come from Egyptian papyri) indicate a very wide range of poetic interests. Alexandrian scholars collected the works of the other two major iambographers, Semonides and Hipponax, in just two books each, which were cited by number, whereas Archilochus was edited and cited not by book number but rather by poetic terms such as &#x27;elegy&#x27;, &#x27;trimeters&#x27;, &#x27;tetrameters&#x27; and &#x27;epodes&#x27;. Moreover, even those terms fail to indicate his versatility:

One convenient way to classify the poems is to divide them between elegy and iambus () – elegy aimed at some degree of decorum, since it employed the stately hexameter of epic, whereas the term &#x27;iambus&#x27;, as used by Alexandrian scholars, denoted any informal kind of verse meant to entertain (it may have included the iambic meter but was not confined to it). Hence the accusation that he was &quot;too iambic&quot; (see Biography) referred not to his choice of meter but his subject matter and tone (for an example of his iambic verse see Strasbourg papyrus). Elegy was accompanied by the aulos or pipe, whereas the performance of iambus varied, from recitation or chant in iambic trimeter and trochaic tetrameter, to singing of epodes accompanied by some musical instrument (which one isn&#x27;t known).

The Alexandrian scholars included Archilochus in their canonical list of iambic poets, along with Semonides and Hipponax, yet ancient commentators also numbered him with Tyrtaeus and Callinus as the possible inventor of the elegy. Modern critics often characterize him simply as a lyric poet, but he was not included in the Alexandrian list of nine lyric poets – his range exceeded their narrow criteria for lyric (&#x27;lyric&#x27; meant verse accompanied by the lyre). He did in fact compose some lyrics but only the smallest fragments of these survive today. However, they include one of the most famous of all lyric utterances, a hymn to Heracles with which victors were hailed at the Olympic Games, with a resounding refrain, , in which the first word imitates the sound of the lyre.

Τήνελλα καλλίνικε,
χαῖρ&#x27; ἄναξ Ἡράκλεες,
αὐτός τε καὶ Ἰόλαος, αἰχμητὰ δύο.
Τήνελλα καλλίνικε
χαῖρ&#x27; ἄναξ Ἡράκλεες.
Although his work now only survives in fragments, Archilochus was revered by the ancient Greeks as one of their most brilliant authors, able to be mentioned in the same breath as Homer and Hesiod, yet he was also censured by them as the archetypal poet of blame – his invectives were even said to have driven his former fiancée and her father to suicide. He presented himself as a man of few illusions either in war or in love, such as in the following elegy, where discretion is seen to be the better part of valour:
Archilochus was much imitated even up to Roman times and three other distinguished poets later claimed to have thrown away their shields – Alcaeus, Anacreon and Horace.

===Style===
Like other archaic Greek poets, Archilochus relied heavily on Homer&#x27;s example for his choice of language, particularly when using the same meter, dactylic hexameter (as for example in elegy), but even in other meters the debt is apparent – in the verse below, for example, his address to his embattled soul or spirit, , has Homeric echoes. The meter below is trochaic tetrameter catalectic (four pairs of trochees with the final syllable omitted), a form later favoured by Athenian dramatists because of its &quot;running&quot; character, expressing aggression and emotional intensity. The comic poet Aristophanes employed it for the arrival on stage of an enraged chorus in &quot;The Knights&quot;, but Archilochus uses it here to communicate the need for emotional moderation. His use of the meter isn&#x27;t intentionally ironic, however, since he didn&#x27;t share the tidy functionalism of later theorists, for whom different meters and verse-forms were endowed with distinctive characters suited to different tasks – his use of meter is &quot;neutral in respect of ethos&quot;. The following verse is indicative too of the fragmentary nature of Archilochus&#x27;s extant work: lines 2 and 3 are probably corrupted and modern scholars have tried to emend them in various ways, though the general meaning is clear.
==Reception and editions==
Fragments of Archilochus&#x27;s poetry were first edited by Theodor Bergk in &quot;Poetae Lyrici Graeci&quot; (tom. II, 1882)
There are about three hundred known fragments of Archilochus&#x27;s poetry, besides some forty paraphrases or indirect quotations, collected in the &quot;Budé&quot; edition (1958, revised 1968)
by François Lasserre and André Bonnard.
About half of these fragments are too short or too damaged to discern any context or intention (some of them consisting of single words).
One of the longest fragments (fragment 13) has ten nearly complete lines.
Thirty previously unknown lines by Archilochus, in the elegiac meter, describing events leading up to the Trojan War, in which Achaeans battled Telephus king of Mysia, have been identified among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri and published in &quot;The Oxyrhynchus Papyri&quot;, Volume LXIX (Graeco-Roman Memoirs 89, 2007).
A discovery of a fragment of writing by Archilochus contained a citation of a proverb that was important to the proper interpretation of a letter in the Akkadian language from the emperor of the Old Assyrian Empire, Shamshi-Adad I, with the same proverb: &quot;The bitch by her acting too hastily brought forth the blind.&quot;

<text>The ancient Greek word aithôn means &quot;burning&quot;, &quot;blazing&quot; or &quot;shining.&quot; Less strictly, it can denote the colour red-brown, or &quot;tawny.&quot; It is an epithet sometimes applied to animals such as horses at Hom. &quot;Il&quot;. 2.839; oxen at &quot;Od&quot;.18.372; and an eagle at &quot;Il&quot;. 15.690 (cf. Hyginus&#x27; calling the eagle that tormented Prometheus an &quot;aethonem aquilam&quot; at &quot;Fabulae&quot; 31.5.). The eagle who tormented Prometheus, Aethon, was the child of the monsters Typhon and Echidna. In English, &quot;aithôn&quot; may be written Aethon, Aithon or Ethon. In Greek and Roman mythology there are a number of characters known as Aethon. Most are horses, variously belonging to:

* Helios
* Ares
* Hector
* Pallas
* Hades (Claudian)

The name is twice applied to humans. In &quot;Odyssey&quot; 19.183, it is the pseudonym a disguised Odysseus assumes during his interview with Penelope upon his return to Ithaca. According to fr. 43a.5 of Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, Erysichthon of Thessaly was also known as Aethon due to the &quot;burning&quot; hunger (&quot;aithôn limos&quot;) he was made to endure by Demeter.

<text>The Palici (, , singular Palicus (Παλικός)), or Palaci, were a pair of indigenous Sicilian chthonic deities in Roman mythology, and to a lesser extent in Greek mythology. They are mentioned in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; V, 406, and in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; IX, 585. Their cult centered on three small lakes that emitted sulphurous vapors in the Palagonia plain, and as a result these twin brothers were associated with geysers and the underworld. There was also a shrine to the Palaci in Palacia, where people could subject themselves or others to tests of reliability through divine judgement; passing meant that an oath could be trusted.

==Genealogy==
The mythological lineage of the Palici is uncertain. One version of the legend attributes their parentage to sky god Zeus and nymph Aetna. Others associate their birth to a coupling between Aetna herself and smith deity Hephaestus. The &quot;Greek version&quot; indicate they are sons of Zeus and another nymph, called Thaleia. A third account claimed that the Palici were the sons of the Sicilian deity Adranus.

The medieval &quot;Vatican Mythographers&quot; book ascribed their lineage to Zeus and Aetna: Zeus (Jupiter) impregnated Aetna and she, fearing the wrath of Hera (Juno), was entrusted to Earth to protect her and her sons.

==Interpretations==
The second book of the &quot;Vatican Mythographers&quot; translated their name as &#x27;twice-born&#x27;.

Scholar Marcel Meulder argues for a Proto-Indo-European origin for their name, and relates it to a group of Greek compound names that belong to the semantic field of colours (e.g., &quot;leuko&quot; &#x27;white&#x27;; &quot;melas&quot; &#x27;black&#x27;). Thus, their name would mean &#x27;of a white colour, of a grey colour, of a yellow colour&#x27; (&quot;blanchâtre, jaunâtre, grisâtre”&quot;). He also suggests it as evidence of the Indo-European character of the Siculian language.

Polish historian Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak and Daria Zawiasa suggest the Palici may derive from the old Indo-European mytheme of the divine twins. They argue that the pair fit some of the common traits that scholar Donald J. Ward ascribed to the mytheme, such as a sky-god&#x27;s paternity and a single designation for both twins.

<text>Aetna Inc. ( ) is an American managed health care company that sells traditional and consumer directed health care insurance and related services, such as medical, pharmaceutical, dental, behavioral health, long-term care, and disability plans, primarily through employer-paid (fully or partly) insurance and benefit programs, and through Medicare. Since November 28, 2018, the company has been a subsidiary of CVS Health.

The company&#x27;s network includes 22.1 million medical members, 12.7 million dental members, 13.1 million pharmacy benefit management services members, 1.2 million health-care professionals, over 690,000 primary care doctors and specialists, and over 5,700 hospitals.

Aetna is descended from Aetna (Fire) Insurance Company of Hartford, Connecticut. The name of the company is based on Mount Etna, at the time the most active volcano in Europe.

== History ==
=== 1800s ===
* 1819: Thomas Kimberly Brace becomes the principal founder and developer of the Aetna (Fire) Insurance Company, established in Hartford. One of his Co-founders was Joseph Morgan, father of J. S. Morgan and grandfather of J. P. Morgan. Brace served as the company&#x27;s first President (and would remain on the Board of Directors until his death in 1860). Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, Yale graduate and attorney, became the second president of Aetna (Fire) Insurance Company, succeeding Thomas Kimberly Brace. Ellsworth, who later became the first U.S. Patent Commissioner, served as Aetna&#x27;s president until 1821, when he resigned. He continued as a director at the company for another 16 years. Ellsworth&#x27;s brother, William Wolcott Ellsworth, also served as a director, as well as the company&#x27;s first general counsel.
* 1820: Brace authored the rewriting of the company Charter allowing Aetna to underwrite life insurance and annuities, earning Brace the title of &quot;father&quot; of American life insurance.
* On May 28, 1853, the Annuity department separated from Aetna Insurance to be incorporated as the Aetna Life Insurance Company, with Eliphalet Bulkeley as president. The fire insurance company went on to become part of Connecticut General, which merged into Cigna.
* On November 29, 1853, J. B. Bennett was appointed general agent of the company.
* 1854: Aetna hired its first full-time employee, Thomas O. Enders, who later became president of the company.
* 1857: Aetna moved to new offices on Hungerford and Cone Streets in Hartford. The Panic of 1857 caused the closing of many businesses. Eliphalet Bulkeley blocked a move to liquidate the company during the economic downturn.
* During the 1850s, The Aetna Insurance Company issued life insurance policies on an undetermined number of African-American slaves, naming their owners as beneficiaries.

Healthcare of tortious interference with contractual relations. BCI alleged the managed-care company used its economic power in the business of prescription drug sales to coerce one of BCI&#x27;s clients, the &quot;I Got It at Gary&#x27;s&quot; pharmacy chain, into using another Aetna U. S. Healthcare subsidiary, Corporate Health Administrators, as its health benefits management firm. According to the suit, Aetna U. S.

== Life insurance policies on slaves ==

In 2000, Deadria Farmer-Paellmann, head of the nonprofit Restitution Study Group of Hoboken, New Jersey, disclosed that, from approximately 1853 to 1860 Aetna, had issued life insurance policies to slaveowners covering the lives of their slaves.

The same year, Aetna acknowledged that concrete evidence exists for Aetna issuing coverage for the lives of slaves and released a public apology.

In 2002, Farmer-Paellmann brought suit against Aetna and two other companies in federal court asking for reparations for the descendants of slaves. The lawsuit said Aetna, CSX and Fleet were &quot;unjustly enriched&quot; by &quot;a system that enslaved, tortured, starved and exploited human beings.&quot; It argued that African-Americans are still suffering the effects of two and a half centuries of enslavement followed by more than a century of institutionalized racism. The complaint blamed slavery for present-day disparities between blacks and whites in income, education, literacy, health, life expectancy and crime.

This suit was dismissed, and the dismissal largely upheld on appeal.

In 2006, Farmer-Paellmann announced a nationwide boycott of Aetna over the issue of reparations for its policies covering slaves. Aetna stated that its commitment to diversity in the workplace and its investment of over $36 million in such areas as education, health, economic development, community partnerships, and minority-owned business initiatives in the African-American community are more effective at aiding descendants of slaves and African-Americans in general than making restitutions for Aetna&#x27;s life insurance policies on slaves.

== Lobbying and campaign contributions ==
Aetna spent more than $2.0 million in 2009 on lobbying. The company spent $809,793 between January 2009 and the end of March 2009—up 41 percent from the same period in 2008. Aetna&#x27;s campaign contributions include more than $110,000 (~$ in ) to US Senator Joe Lieberman (I-CT) in 2009. From 2005 through 2009, Aetna contributed $56,250 to Senator Max Baucus (D-MT), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, making Aetna the senator&#x27;s seventh highest contributor over that time period.

<text>Louis X (4 October 1289 – 5 June 1316), known as the Quarrelsome (), was King of France from 1314 and King of Navarre (as Louis I) from 1305 until his death. He emancipated serfs who could buy their freedom and readmitted Jews into the kingdom. His short reign in France was marked by tensions with the nobility, due to fiscal and centralisation reforms initiated during the reign of his father by Grand Chamberlain Enguerrand de Marigny.

Louis&#x27; first wife, Margaret, was implicated in the Tour de Nesle affair. She was found guilty of infidelity and imprisoned until her death in August 1315. Louis married Clémence of Hungary the same year, but the king died in 1316 leaving his wife pregnant. Queen Clémence gave birth to a boy, who was proclaimed king as John I, but the infant lived only five days. Louis&#x27; brother Philip, Count of Poitiers, succeeded John to become Philip V of France.

==Biography==

Louis was born in Paris, the eldest son of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. He inherited the kingdom of Navarre on the death of his mother, on 4 April 1305, and was crowned on 1 October 1307. On 21 September 1305, at age 15, he married Margaret of Burgundy and they had a daughter, Joan. Louis was known as &quot;the Quarreler&quot;, &quot;the Quarrelsome&quot;, as the result of the tensions prevailing throughout his reigns.

Both Louis and Margaret became involved in the Tour de Nesle affair towards the end of Philip&#x27;s reign. In 1314, Margaret, Blanche and Joan — the latter two being the wives of Louis&#x27; brothers Charles and Philip, respectively — were arrested on charges of infidelity. Margaret and Blanche were both tried before the French parlement later that year and found guilty. Their alleged lovers were executed, and the women had their hair shorn and were sentenced to life imprisonment. Philip stood by his wife Joan, who was ultimately found innocent and released. Margaret would be imprisoned at Chateau Gaillard in Normandy.

On the death of his father in 1314, Louis became King of France. Margaret of Burgundy would not be released from imprisonment or crowned, but as his wife, she technically became Queen of France. Without an incumbent pope, Louis could not annul his marriage. The imprisoned Queen of France died on 14 August 1315 and Louis remarried five days later, on 19 August to Clémence of Hungary, the daughter of Charles Martel of Anjou and the niece of Louis&#x27; own uncle and close advisor, Charles of Valois. Louis and Clémence were crowned at Reims in August 1315.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1305, Louis married Margaret of Burgundy, with whom he had a daughter, Joan II of Navarre. Margaret was later convicted of adultery, was imprisoned in Château Gaillard, caught a cold and died in 1315, although another source states that she was strangled to death. In 1315, Louis married Clémence of Hungary, who gave birth to John I of France five months after the king&#x27;s death. The infant John&#x27;s death a few days later led to a disputed succession. With an unknown woman, Louis had a daughter, Eudeline, who joined the Order of St. Claire and became the abbess of the Franciscan nuns of Paris, 1334-1339.

==Domestic policy==
Louis was king of Navarre for eleven years and king of France for less than two years. His reign was dominated by continual feuding with the noble factions within the kingdom, and major reforms designed to increase royal revenues, such as the freeing of the French serfs and the readmittance of the Jews.

===Regional leagues===

By the end of Philip IV&#x27;s reign opposition to the fiscal reforms was growing. With Philip&#x27;s death and the accession of Louis, this opposition rapidly developed into more open revolt, some authors citing Louis&#x27; relative youth as one of the reasons behind the timing of the rebellions. Leagues of regional nobles began to form around the country, demanding changes. Charles of Valois took advantage of this movement to turn against his old enemy, Philip IV&#x27;s former minister and chamberlain Enguerrand de Marigny, and convinced Louis to bring corruption charges against him. When these failed, Charles then convinced Louis to bring sorcery charges against him instead, which proved more effective and led to de Marigny&#x27;s execution at Vincennes in April 1315. Other former ministers were similarly prosecuted. This, combined with the halting of Philip&#x27;s reforms, the issuing of numerous charters of rights and a reversion to more traditional rule, largely assuaged the regional leagues.

===Edict freeing serfs===
In July 1315, Louis X issued an edict effectively abolishing serfdom in the royal domain. As a way of raising revenues, for his war against Flanders, and having alighted on a reform of French serfdom as a way of achieving this, he declared that French serfs would be freed, although each serf would have to purchase his freedom. A body of commissioners was established to undertake the reform, establishing the &quot;peculium&quot;, or value, of each serf. For serfs owned directly by the King, all of the &quot;peculium&quot; would be received by the Crown; for serfs owned by subjects of the King, the amount would be divided between the Crown and the owner.

=== Readmittance of Jews ===

Louis was also responsible for a key shift in policy towards the Jews. In 1306, his father, Philip IV, had expelled the Jewish minority from across France, a &quot;shattering&quot; event for most of these communities. Louis began to reconsider this policy, motivated by the additional revenues that might be forthcoming to the Crown if the Jews were allowed to return. Accordingly, Louis issued a charter in 1315, readmitting the Jews subject to various conditions. The Jews would be admitted back into France for only twelve years, after which the agreement might be terminated; Jews were to wear an armband at all times; Jews could live only in those areas where there had been Jewish communities previously; Jews were initially to be forbidden from usury. This was the first time that French Jews had been covered by such a charter, and Louis was careful to justify his decision with reference to the policies of his ancestor Saint Louis IX, the position of Pope Clement V and an argument that the people of France had demanded a return of the Jews. The result was a much-weakened Jewish community that depended directly upon the King for their right of abode and protection.

===Challenge of Flanders===
Louis X continued the effort of his predecessor to achieve a military solution to the vexing problem of Flanders. The count of Flanders ruled an &quot;immensely wealthy state&quot; which enjoyed a largely autonomous existence on the margins of the French realm; French kings claimed to exercise suzerainty over Flanders, but heretofore with little success. Philip IV had attempted to assert royal overlordship, but his army, led by Robert II of Artois, had been defeated at Courtrai in 1302; despite a later French victory at the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle the relationship remained testy and unsettled.

Louis mobilised an army along the Flemish border, but the French position rapidly became strained by the demands of maintaining a wartime footing. Louis had prohibited exports of grain and other material to Flanders in 1315. This proved challenging to enforce, and the king had to pressure officers of the Church in the borderlands, as well as Edward II of England, to support his effort to prevent Spanish merchant vessels from trading with the embargoed Flemish. An unintended result of the embargo was the rise of smuggling activities that reduced the advantage (and consequently the amount) of trading in compliance with royal restrictions in the border region. Louis was also forced to requisition food directly for his forces, resulting in a series of complaints from local lords and the Church.

==Death and legacy==

Louis was a keen player of &quot;jeu de paume&quot;, or real tennis, and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. Louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor, enclosed courts made in Paris &quot;around the end of the 13th century&quot;. In due course this design spread across royal palaces all over Europe. On 5 June 1316 at Vincennes, following a particularly exhausting game, Louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy, although there were also suspicions of poisoning. Because of the contemporary accounts of his death, Louis is history&#x27;s first tennis player known by name. He and his second wife Clémence are interred in Saint Denis Basilica.

Louis&#x27; second wife Clémence was pregnant at the time of his death, leaving the succession in doubt. A son would have primacy over Louis&#x27; daughter, Joan. A daughter, however, would have a weaker claim to the throne, and would need to compete with Joan&#x27;s own claims, although suspicions hung over Joan&#x27;s parentage following the scandal of 1314. As a result, Louis&#x27; brother Philip was appointed regent for the five months remaining until the birth of his brother&#x27;s child, John I, who lived only five days. Philip then succeeded in pressing his claims to the crowns of France and Navarre.

All &quot;de jure&quot; monarchs of Navarre from 1328 onwards were descended from Louis through his daughter, Joan, including Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, the mother of Henry IV of France, and therefore the entire royal House of Bourbon.

==In fiction==
Louis is a major character in &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of French historical novels by Maurice Druon. He was portrayed by in the 1972 French miniseries adaptation of the series, and by Guillaume Depardieu in the 2005 adaptation.

<doc id="78346" wikidata="Q469838" url="?curid=78346" title="Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk">
<text>Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk, later [[Duchess of York]] and [[Duchess of Norfolk]] (10 December 1472 – 19 November 1481) was the child bride of Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower. She died at the age of eight.

==Heiress==
She was born on 10 December 1472 at Framlingham Castle in Suffolk, the only (surviving) child of John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk and Lady Elizabeth Talbot. Her maternal grandparents were John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and his second wife Lady Margaret Beauchamp. The death of her father in 1476 left Anne a wealthy heiress.

==Marriage==
On 15 January 1478, aged 6, she was married in St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel, Westminster, to Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, the 4-year-old younger son of King Edward IV and his Queen, Elizabeth Woodville.

==Death and heirs==
Anne died at Greenwich in London on 19 November 1481, nearly two years before her husband disappeared into the Tower of London with his older brother, Edward V. Upon her death, her heirs normally would have been her cousins, William, Viscount Berkeley and John, Lord Howard, but by an act of Parliament in January 1483 the rights were given to her husband Richard, with reversion to his descendants, and, failing that, to the descendants of his father Edward IV.

==Burial==
Anne was buried in a lead coffin in the Chapel of St. Erasmus of Formia in Westminster Abbey. When that chapel was demolished in about 1502 to make way for the Henry VII Lady Chapel, Anne&#x27;s coffin was moved to a vault under the Abbey of the Minoresses of St. Clare without Aldgate, run by nuns of the Order of Poor Clares Franciscans. Her coffin eventually disappeared.

In December 1964, construction workers in Stepney accidentally dug into the vault and found Anne&#x27;s coffin. It was opened, and her remains were analysed by scientists and then entombed in Westminster Abbey in May 1965. Her red hair was still on her skull and her shroud was still wrapped around her. Westminster Abbey is the presumed resting place of her husband, Richard Duke of York, and his brother Edward V, in the Henry VII Chapel.

<text>The flag of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] was white, with a horizontal blue stripe in the center, one-third of the flag&#x27;s hoist, superimposed on a vertical red stripe of the same width, also centered; six white, five-pointed stars are arranged in a hexagon pattern in the center of the blue band, their points up. It was adopted on 19 November 1959.

The six stars represented the six main islands of Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. The colors red, white and blue refer to the Dutch flag.

==1986 modification==
On 1 January 1986, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles, resulting in the flag being modified to depict only five stars to represent the remaining five islands.

==Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles==

On 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles was dissolved into Curaçao, Sint Maarten and the three public bodies of the Caribbean Netherlands.

<doc id="78354" wikidata="Q175366" url="?curid=78354" title="Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone">
<text>Quintin McGarel Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone (9 October 1907 – 12 October 2001), known as the 2nd Viscount Hailsham between 1950 and 1963, at which point he disclaimed his hereditary peerage, was a British barrister and Conservative Party politician.

Like his father, Hailsham was considered to be a contender for the leadership of the Conservative Party. He was a contender to succeed Harold Macmillan as prime minister in 1963, renouncing his hereditary peerage to do so, but was passed over in favour of Sir Alec Douglas-Home. He was created a life peer in 1970 and served as Lord Chancellor, the office formerly held by his father, in 1970–74 and 1979–87.

==Background==
Born in Bayswater, London, Hogg was the son of the 1st Viscount Hailsham, who was Lord Chancellor under Stanley Baldwin, and grandson of Quintin Hogg, a merchant, philanthropist and educational reformer, and an American mother; Hogg&#x27;s great-grandfather was Sir James Hogg, 1st Baronet, a businessman and politician from Ulster. The middle name McGarel comes from Charles McGarel, an Ulsterman who had large holdings of slaves, and who financially sponsored Quintin Hogg&#x27;s grandfather, also called Quintin Hogg, who was McGarel&#x27;s brother-in-law.

Hogg was educated at Sunningdale School and then Eton College, where he was a King&#x27;s Scholar and won the Newcastle Scholarship in 1925. He entered Christ Church, Oxford as a Scholar and he was President of the Oxford University Conservative Association and of the Oxford Union. He took Firsts in Honours Moderations in 1928 and in &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; in 1930. He was elected to a Prize Fellowship in Law at All Souls College, Oxford, in 1931. He was called to the bar by Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1932.

Hogg spoke in opposition to the motion &quot;That this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country&quot; in the 1933 King and Country debate at the Oxford Union.

== Politics and Second World War ==
Hogg participated in his first election campaign in the 1924 general election, and all subsequent general election campaigns until his death. In 1938, Hogg was chosen as a candidate for Parliament in the Oxford by-election. This election took place shortly after the Munich Agreement and the Labour candidate Patrick Gordon Walker was persuaded to step down to allow a unified challenge to the Conservatives; A. D. Lindsay, the Master of Balliol College fought as an &#x27;Independent Progressive&#x27; candidate. Hogg narrowly defeated Lindsay, who was said to be horrified by the popular slogan of &quot;Hitler wants Hogg&quot;.

Hogg voted against Neville Chamberlain in the Norway Debate of May 1940, and supported Winston Churchill. He served briefly in the desert campaign as a platoon commander with the Rifle Brigade during the Second World War. His commanding officer had been his contemporary at Eton; after him and the second-in-command, Hogg was the third-oldest officer in the battalion. After a knee wound in August 1941, which almost cost him his right leg, Hogg was deemed too old for further front-line service, and later served on the staff of General &quot;Jumbo&quot; Wilson before leaving the army with the rank of major. In the run-up to the 1945 election, Hogg wrote a response to the book &quot;Guilty Men&quot;, called &quot;The Left Was Never Right&quot;.

==Conservative minister==
Hogg&#x27;s father died in 1950 and Hogg entered the House of Lords, succeeding his father as the second Viscount Hailsham. Believing his political career to be over he concentrated on his career at the bar for some years, taking silk in 1953 and becoming head of his barristers&#x27; chambers in 1955, succeeding to Kenneth Diplock. When the Conservatives returned to power under Churchill in 1951, he refused to be considered for office. In 1956, he refused appointment as Postmaster-General under Anthony Eden on financial grounds, only to accept appointment as First Lord of the Admiralty six weeks later. His appointment, however, had to be delayed because of the Crabb affair.

As First Lord, Hailsham was briefed about Eden&#x27;s plans to use military force against Egypt, which he thought were &#x27;madness&#x27;. Nevertheless, once Operation Musketeer had been launched, he thought that Britain could not retreat until the Suez Canal had been captured. When, in the middle of the operation, Lord Mountbatten threatened to resign as First Sea Lord in protest, Hailsham ordered him in writing to stay on duty: he believed that Mountbatten was entitled to be protected by his minister, and that he was bound to resign if the honour of the Navy was impaired by the conduct of the operation. Hailsham remained critical of the actions of the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Harold Macmillan, during the crisis, believing that he had suffered from a failure of nerve.

Hailsham became Minister of Education in 1957 under Macmillan, holding the office for eight months, before accepting appointment as Lord President of the Council and Chairman of the Conservative Party in September 1957. During his term as Party Chairman, the Conservative Party won a notable victory in the 1959 general election, which it had been predicted to lose. Nevertheless, shortly after the election, Hailsham was sidelined, and was made Minister for Science and Technology, serving in that post until 1964. His tenure as Science Minister was successful, and he was later elected to the Royal Society under Statute 12 in 1973.

Concurrently, Hailsham was Lord Privy Seal between 1959 and 1960, Lord President of the Council between 1960 and 1964, and Leader of the House of Lords between 1960 and 1963, having been Deputy Leader between 1957 and 1960. He was also given a number of special assignments by Macmillan, becoming Minister with special responsibility for Sport from 1962 to 1964, for unemployment in the North-East between 1963 and 1964 and for higher education between 1963 and 1964. Hailsham, who had little interest in sports, thought little of his appointment as &quot;de facto&quot; Sports minister, later writing that &quot;[t]he idea of a Minister for Sport has always appalled me. It savours of dictatorship and the nastiest kind of populist or Fascist dictatorship at that.&quot;

Hailsham appeared before the Wolfenden Committee to discuss homosexuality. The historian Patrick Higgins said that he used it as &quot;an opportunity to express his disgust&quot;. He stated &quot;The instinct of mankind to describe homosexual acts as &quot;unnatural&quot; is not based on mere prejudice&quot; and that homosexuals were corrupting and &quot;a proselytising religion&quot;.

In June 1963 when his fellow Minister John Profumo had to resign after admitting lying to Parliament about his private life, Hailsham attacked him savagely on television. The Labour MP Reginald Paget called this &quot;a virtuoso performance of the art of kicking a friend in the guts&quot;. He added, &quot;When self-indulgence has reduced a man to the shape of Lord Hailsham, sexual continence involves no more than a sense of the ridiculous&quot;.

In 15 July, he and Averell Harriman arrived in Moscow on nuclear test-ban negotiations.

=== Disclaimer of peerage and Conservative Party leadership bid ===
Hailsham was Leader of the House of Lords when Harold Macmillan announced his sudden resignation from the premiership for health reasons at the start of the 1963 Conservative Party conference. At that time there was no formal ballot for the Conservative Party leadership. Hailsham, who was at first Macmillan&#x27;s preferred successor, announced that he would use the newly enacted Peerage Act 1963 to disclaim his title and fight a by-election and return to the House of Commons. His publicity-seeking antics at the Party Conference—such as feeding his baby daughter in public, and allowing his supporters to distribute &quot;Q&quot; (for Quintin) badges—were considered vulgar at the time, so Macmillan did not encourage senior party members to choose him as his successor. 

Eventually, on the advice of Macmillan, The Queen chose Sir Alec Douglas-Home to succeed Macmillan as prime minister. Hailsham nevertheless renounced his peerage on 20 November 1963, becoming again Quintin Hogg. He stood and was elected as MP for St Marylebone, his father&#x27;s old constituency, in the 1963 St Marylebone by-election.

Hogg as a campaigner was known for his robust rhetoric and theatrical gestures. He was usually in good form in dealing with hecklers, a valuable skill in the 1960s, and was prominent in the 1964 general election. One evening when giving a political address, he was hailed by his supporters as he leaned over the lectern pointing at a long-haired heckler. He said, &quot;Now, see here, Sir or Madam whichever the case might be, we have had enough of you!&quot; The police ejected the man and the crowd applauded and Hogg went on as if nothing had happened. Another time, when a Labour Party supporter waved a Harold Wilson placard in front of him, Hogg smacked it with his walking-stick.

=== Lord Chancellorship ===

Hogg served in the Conservative shadow cabinet during the Wilson government, and built up his practice at the bar where one of his clients was the Prime Minister and political opponent Harold Wilson. When Edward Heath won the 1970 general election he received a life peerage as Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone, of Herstmonceux in the County of Sussex, and became Lord Chancellor. Hogg was the first to return to the House of Lords as a life peer after having disclaimed an hereditary peerage. Hailsham&#x27;s choice of Lord Widgery as Lord Chief Justice was criticised by his opponents, although he later redeemed himself in the eyes of the profession by appointing Lord Lane to succeed Widgery. His appointment as Lord Chancellor caused some amusement; in October 1962 he had told a journalist (Logan Gourlay of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;) that when he had inherited his title he had thought that by 1970 if the Tory Government were in power &quot;some ass might make me Lord Chancellor&quot;.

During his first term as Lord Chancellor, Hailsham oversaw the passage of the Courts Act 1971, which fundamentally reformed the English justice by abolishing the ancient assizes and quarter sessions, which were replaced by permanent Crown Courts. The Act also established a unified court service, under the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, which as a result expanded substantially. He also piloted through the House of Lords Heath&#x27;s controversial Industrial Relations Act 1971, which established the short-lived National Industrial Relations Court.

Hailsham announced his retirement after the end of the Heath government in 1974. He popularised the term &#x27;elective dictatorship&#x27; in 1976, later writing a detailed exposition, &quot;The Dilemma of Democracy&quot;. However, after the tragic death of his second wife in a riding accident, he decided to return to active politics, first as a Shadow Minister without Portfolio in the Shadow Cabinets of Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher, then again as Lord Chancellor from 1979 to 1987 under Margaret Thatcher.

Hailsham was widely considered as a traditionalist Lord Chancellor. He put great emphasis on the traditional roles of his post, sitting on the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords more frequently than any of his post-war predecessors. Appointment of deputies to preside over the Lords enabled him to give more time to judicial work, although he often sat on the woolsack himself. He was protective of the English bar, opposing the appointment of solicitors to the High Court and the extension of their rights of audience. He was, however, responsible for implementing the far-reaching 1971 reform of the courts system, and championed law reform and the work of the Law Commission.

=== Retirement ===
After his retirement, Hailsham vigorously opposed the Thatcher government&#x27;s plans to reform the legal profession. He opposed the introduction of contingency fees, observing that the professions were &quot;not like the grocer&#x27;s shop at the corner of a street in a town like Grantham&quot; – a reference to Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s origins – (&quot;Hansard&quot; 5L, 505.1334, 7 April 1989) and arguing that the Courts and Legal Services Act (1990) disregarded &quot;almost every principle of the methodology which law reform ought to attract&quot; and was no less than an attempt to &quot;nationalise the profession and part of the judiciary&quot; (&quot;Hansard&quot; 5L, 514.151, 19 December 1989).

Towards the end of his life Hailsham suffered from depression, which he managed somewhat by his lifelong love of classical literature.

Hailsham remained an active if semi-detached member of the governing body of All Souls College almost until his death.

=== Honours ===
In addition to his peerages, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1974 and was made a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1988.

==Personal life==
Hailsham was married three times. He was married firstly in 1932 to Natalie Sullivan. The marriage was dissolved in 1943 after he returned from the war to find her, as he later put it in a television interview, &quot;not alone&quot;: she was with French president Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s &quot;chef de cabinet&quot;, François Coulet.

On 18 April 1944, he married Mary Evelyn Martin (19 May 1919 – 10 March 1978), a descendant of the Martyn family of The Tribes of Galway. They had five children including Douglas Martin Hogg, 3rd Viscount Hailsham, and Mary Claire Hogg.

Hailsham inherited Carter&#x27;s Corner Place, a 17th-century house with wide views over the Pevensey marshes and the English Channel, from his father in 1950, and practised farming there for more than a decade. In 1963 he sold the property because of the cost and because his wife found the upkeep too much of a strain, but he continued to visit it thereafter.

His wife Mary was killed in front of her husband in a horse-riding accident during a visit to Sydney, Australia, in 1978. Hailsham was distraught and blamed himself for not having reminded her to wear a hard hat. Her gravestone at All Saints, Herstmonceux, Sussex, describes her as his &quot;radiant and joyous companion&quot;.

On 1 March 1986, Hailsham married Deirdre Margaret Shannon Aft (1928/9–1998), a former secretary in his chambers. She cared for him in his old age, but predeceased him in 1998.

==Personality and disability==
Hailsham retained some of the manner of a clever schoolboy – likeable, irritating and untidy – throughout his life. He was in the habit of reciting long passages of Ancient Greek verse at inappropriate moments in conversations.

As a young man Hailsham was a keen mountain-climber, and broke both his ankles while climbing the Valais Alps. The fractures (which he wrongly believed to be sprains) healed at the time. Hailsham remained physically energetic until late middle age, and in the 1960s he could often be seen cycling unsteadily around London, dressed in the bowler hat and pin-striped suit of a barrister. He was also a scuba diver who trained with the British Sub-Aqua Club. However, both of his damaged ankles, as he later wrote, &quot;packed up within a week of one another in June 1974&quot;. Thereafter he was only able to walk short distances, with the aid of two walking-sticks. In old age he also suffered from arthritis.

==Death and succession==
Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone died from heart failure and pneumonia at his home in Putney Heath, London, on 12 October 2001, aged 94. The viscountcy that he had disclaimed in 1963 was inherited by his elder son Douglas, who was then an MP. As a result of the House of Lords Act 1999, which removed the right of most hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, it was not necessary for him to disclaim his viscountcy to remain a member of the House of Commons.

Like his father and other members of the family, he was buried in the churchyard at All Saints, Herstmonceux, Sussex.

Hailsham&#x27;s wealth at death was valued for probate at £4,618,511 (around £7.5m at 2018 prices).

==Assessment and legacy==
S. M. Cretney argues that &quot;Hailsham was on any assessment one of the outstanding personalities of 20th-century British politics. None of his contemporaries combined so brilliant and well-trained an intellect with a capacity for oratory that enjoyed such wide appeal. His most notable success may well have been his role in reviving the Conservative Party&#x27;s fortunes in the 1950s … even so, Hailsham&#x27;s actual achievements in politics arguably failed to reflect his remarkable intellectual power and oratorical skills&quot; and that given his &quot;emotional and temperamental volatility and even instability ... it is difficult to make any rational estimate of quite what a Hailsham administration would have achieved&quot; had he become Prime Minister in 1963.

In Jimmy McGovern&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Sunday&quot;, which portrayed the events of Bloody Sunday and the subsequent Widgery Tribunal, Hailsham was played by the actor Oliver Ford Davies.

==Writings==

Hogg&#x27;s 1945 book &quot;The Left Was Never Right&quot; was a fierce response to two books in Victor Gollancz&#x27;s &quot;Victory Books&quot; series, &quot;Guilty Men&quot; by Frank Owen, Michael Foot, and Peter Howard, and &quot;Your M.P.&quot; by Tom Wintringham, both published during the war and largely attempting to discredit Tory MPs as appeasers and war profiteers. The Wintringham volume had been republished in the lead up to the 1945 general election, widely acknowledged at the time as a major factor in shifting public opinion away from the Conservative party. Hogg&#x27;s book sought to contrast Wintringham&#x27;s statistics on appeasement with patriotic statistics of his own, maintaining that Labour MPs had been lacking in their wartime duties.

Perhaps his most important book, the Penguin paperback &quot;The Case for Conservatism&quot;, was a similar response to &quot;Labour Marches On&quot; by John Parker MP. Published in 1947 in the aftermath of the crushing Conservative election defeat of 1945, and aimed at the mass market and the layman, it presented a well-written and coherent case for Conservatism. According to the book, the role of Conservatism is not to oppose all change but to resist and balance the volatility of current political fads and ideology, and to defend a middle position that enshrines a slowly changing organic humane traditionalism. For example, in the 19th century Conservatives often opposed the policies of prevailing British liberalism, favouring factory regulation, market intervention and controls to mitigate the effects of &quot;laissez faire&quot; capitalism, but in the 20th century the role of Conservatism was to oppose an ostensible danger from the opposite direction, the regulation, intervention, and controls favoured by social democracy.

Hailsham was also known for his writings on faith and belief. In 1975 he published his spiritual autobiography &quot;The Door Wherein I Went&quot;, which included a brief chapter of Christian apologetics, using legal arguments concerning the evidence for the life of Jesus. The book included a particularly moving passage about suicide; when he was a young man his half-brother Edward Marjoribanks had taken his own life, and the experience left Hailsham with a deep conviction that suicide is always wrong.

His writings on Christianity have been the subject of discussion in the writings of Ross Clifford. Hailsham revisited themes of faith in his memoirs &quot;A Sparrow&#x27;s Flight&quot; (1991), and the book&#x27;s title alluded to remarks about sparrows and faith recorded in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; and the words of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew.

<text>Aganippe (; Ancient Greek: Ἀγανίππη means &#x27;mare who kills mercifully&#x27;) was a name or epithet of several figures in Greek mythology:

*Aganippe, a naiad of the spring Aganippe.
*Aganippe, wife of King Acrisius of Argos, and according to some accounts the mother of Danaë and possibly Evarete. Although in some accounts, Eurydice was wife of Acrisius and the mother of Danae.
*Aganippe, an aspect of Demeter. In this form she was a black winged horse worshiped by certain cults. In this aspect her idols (such as one found in Mavrospelya, the Black Cave, in Phigalia) she was portrayed as mare-headed with a mane entwined with Gorgon Snakes. This aspect was also associated with Anion (or Arion) whom Heracles rode, who later inspired tales of Pegasus.
Aganippis, a name used by Ovid as an epithet of Hippocrene; its meaning however is not quite clear. It is derived from Aganippe, the well or nymph, and as &quot;Aganippides&quot; is used to designate the Muses, Aganippis Hippocrene may mean nothing more than &quot;Hippocrene, sacred to the Muses&quot;.

== Namesake ==
&quot;Aganippe&quot;, a genus of trapdoor spiders

<doc id="78356" wikidata="Q312137" url="?curid=78356" title="Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York">
<text>Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (21 September 1411 – 30 December 1460), also named Richard Plantagenet, was a leading English magnate and claimant to the throne during the Wars of the Roses. He was a member of the ruling House of Plantagenet by virtue of being a direct male-line descendant of Edmund of Langley, King Edward III&#x27;s fourth surviving son. However, it was through his mother, Anne Mortimer, a descendant of Edward III&#x27;s second surviving son, Lionel of Antwerp, that Richard inherited his strongest claim to the throne, as the opposing House of Lancaster was descended from John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, the third surviving son of Edward III. He also inherited vast estates and served in various offices of state in Ireland, France, and England, a country he ultimately governed as Lord Protector due to the mental instability of King Henry VI.

Richard&#x27;s conflicts with Henry&#x27;s wife, Margaret of Anjou, and other members of Henry&#x27;s court, such as Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, and his competing claim to the throne, were leading factors in the political upheaval of mid-fifteenth-century England, and a major cause of the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487). Richard eventually attempted to take the throne, but was dissuaded, although it was agreed that he would become king on Henry&#x27;s death. However, within weeks of securing this agreement (the Act of Accord), he was killed at the Battle of Wakefield, alongside his son, Edmund. Two of his surviving sons later ascended the throne: Edward IV and Richard III.

==Descent==

Richard of York was born on 22 September 1411, the son of Richard, Earl of Cambridge (1385–1415), and his wife Anne Mortimer (1388–1411). Both his parents were descended from King Edward III of England (1312–1377): his father was son of Edmund, 1st Duke of York (founder of the House of York), fourth surviving son of Edward III, whereas his mother Anne Mortimer was a great-granddaughter of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, Edward&#x27;s second son. After the death in 1425 of Anne&#x27;s childless brother Edmund, Earl of March, this ancestry supplied her son Richard, of the House of York, with a claim to the English throne that was arguably superior to that of the reigning House of Lancaster, descended from John of Gaunt, the third son of Edward III.

Richard had an only sister, Isabel. Richard&#x27;s mother, Anne Mortimer, died during or shortly after his birth, and his father the Earl of Cambridge was beheaded in 1415 for his part in the Southampton Plot against the Lancastrian King Henry V. Within a few months of his father&#x27;s death, Richard&#x27;s childless uncle, Edward, 2nd Duke of York, was slain at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and so Richard inherited Edward&#x27;s title and lands, becoming 3rd duke of York. The lesser title but greater estates of the Mortimer family, along with their claim to the throne, also descended to him on the death of his maternal uncle Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, in 1425.

Richard of York already held a strong claim to the English throne, being the heir general of Edward III while also related to the same king in a direct male line of descent. Once he inherited the vast Mortimer estates, he also became the wealthiest and most powerful noble in England, second only to the king himself. An account shows that York&#x27;s net income from Welsh and marcher lands alone was £3,430 in the year 1443–44.

==Childhood and upbringing==
Upon the death of the Earl of Cambridge, Richard became a ward of the crown. As he was an orphan, his property was managed by royal officials. Despite his father&#x27;s plot against the king, along with his provocative ancestry—one which had been used in the past as a rallying point by enemies of the House of Lancaster—Richard was allowed to inherit his family estates without any legal constraints. His considerable lands as duke of York meant that his wardship was a valuable gift of the crown, and in December 1423 this was sold to Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland.

Little is recorded of Richard&#x27;s early life. As a royal ward, in 1416 he was placed under the guardianship of the Lancastrian retainer Robert Waterton, under whose tutelage he remained until 1423, in a low public profile. Then, as ward of the Earl of Westmorland, York was brought up in the Neville family hearth until his majority. The earl had fathered an enormous family, having had twenty-two children, and had many daughters needing husbands; as was his right, he betrothed the thirteen-year-old Richard to his nine-year-old daughter Cecily Neville in 1424. The marriage, which took place by October 1429, meant that Richard was now related to much of the English upper aristocracy, many of whose members had themselves married into the Neville family. In October 1425, when Ralph Neville died, he bequeathed the wardship of York to his widow, Joan Beaufort. By now the wardship was even more valuable, as Richard had inherited the vast Mortimer estates on the death of the Earl of March.

Over the next few years, York was drawn more closely into the circle around the young king. On 19 May 1426 he was knighted at Leicester by John, Duke of Bedford, the younger brother of King Henry V. He was present at the coronation of King Henry VI on 6 November 1429 in Westminster Abbey, and on 20 January 1430 he acted as Constable of England for a duel in the presence of the king at Smithfield. He then followed Henry to France, being present at his coronation as king of France in Notre-Dame in 1431. Finally, on 12 May 1432, he came into his inheritance and was granted full control of his estates. On 22 April 1433, York was admitted to the knightly Order of the Garter.

==War in France==
As York reached majority, events were unfolding in France which would tie him to the events of the ongoing Hundred Years&#x27; War. In the spring of 1434, York attended a great council meeting at Westminster which attempted to conciliate the king&#x27;s uncles, the dukes of Bedford and Gloucester (heads of the regency government), over disagreements regarding the conduct of the war in France. Henry V&#x27;s conquests in France could not be sustained forever, as England either needed to conquer more territory to ensure permanent French subordination, or to concede territory to gain a negotiated settlement. During Henry VI&#x27;s minority, his Council took advantage of French weakness and the alliance with Burgundy to increase England&#x27;s possessions, but following the Treaty of Arras of 1435, Burgundy ceased to recognise the English king&#x27;s claim to the French throne.

In May 1436, a few months after Bedford&#x27;s death, York was appointed to succeed him as commander of the English forces in France. York&#x27;s appointment was one of a number of stop-gap measures after the death of Bedford to try to retain French possessions until the young King Henry VI could assume personal rule. His actual departure was delayed due to disagreements pertaining to the terms of his indentures. Rather than receiving the same powers Bedford had enjoyed as &quot;regent&quot;, York was forced to settle for a lesser role as &quot;lieutenant-general and governor&quot;, by which he was not allowed to appoint major financial and military officials.

York landed in France on 7 June 1436, disembarking at Honfleur. This was the duke&#x27;s first military command. The fall of Paris (his original destination) led to his army being redirected to Rouen. Working with Bedford&#x27;s captains, York had some success, recovering many lost areas in Normandy while establishing good order and justice in the duchy. The campaigns were mainly conducted by Lord Talbot, one of the leading English captains of the day, but York also played a part in stopping and reversing French advances, recapturing Fécamp and a number of towns in the Pays de Caux.

However, he was dissatisfied with the terms under which he was appointed, as he had to find much of the money to pay his troops and other expenses from his own estates. York was keen to leave France as soon as his original twelve-month term of office expired, but he was instructed to remain until the arrival of his successor, the Earl of Warwick, and he did not return to England until November 1437. In spite of York&#x27;s position as one of the leading nobles of the realm, he was not included in Henry VI&#x27;s Council on his return.

==France again==
Henry VI turned to York again in 1440 after peace negotiations failed. He was reappointed Lieutenant of France on 2 July, this time with the same powers that the late Bedford had earlier been granted. As in 1437, York was able to count on the loyalty of Bedford&#x27;s supporters, including Sir John Fastolf, Sir William Oldhall and Sir William ap Thomas. He was promised an annual income of £20,000 to support his position. Duchess Cecily accompanied him to Normandy, and his children Edward, Edmund and Elizabeth were all born in Rouen.

York reached France in 1441 and quickly moved up the Seine towards Pontoise, which was besieged by the French. Though York failed to bring the French to battle, he and Lord Talbot—in what would be the highlight of York&#x27;s military career—led a brilliant campaign involving several river crossings around the Seine and Oise, chasing them almost up to the walls of Paris. In the end, all of York&#x27;s efforts were in vain, for the French took Pontoise by assault in September 1441. This was to be York&#x27;s only military action during his second lieutenancy.

In 1442, York continued to hold the line in Normandy. He signed a treaty with Isabel, duchess of Burgundy, at Dijon on 23 April 1443, which created an indefinite truce between England and Burgundy. Funding the war effort was becoming an increasing issue: though he was paid his annuity of £20,000 in 1441–2, York did not receive anything more from England until February 1444.

However, in 1443 Henry VI put the newly created Duke of Somerset, John Beaufort, in charge of an army of 8,000 men, initially intended for the relief of Gascony. This denied York much-needed men and resources at a time when he was struggling to hold the borders of Normandy. Not only that, but the terms of Somerset&#x27;s appointment could have caused York to feel that his own role as effective regent over the whole of Lancastrian France was reduced to that of governor of Normandy. The English establishment in Normandy expressed strong opposition to the measure, but the delegation York sent to remonstrate against the decision was unsuccessful. Somerset&#x27;s campaign itself also added to the insult: his conduct brought England to odds with the dukes of Brittany and Alençon, disrupting York&#x27;s attempts (conducted during 1442–43) to involve the English in an alliance of French nobles. Somerset&#x27;s army achieved nothing and eventually returned to Normandy, where Somerset died in 1444. This may have been the start of the hatred that York harboured for the Beaufort family, a resentment that would later turn into civil war.

English policy now turned back to a negotiated peace (or at least a truce) with France, so the remainder of York&#x27;s time in France was spent in routine administration and domestic matters. York met Margaret of Anjou, the intended bride for Henry VI, on 18 March 1445 at Pontoise.

==Role in politics before 1450==
York appears to have kept a low profile in English politics before his final return to England, in 1445. King Henry VI seems to have been reluctant to employ York, who was not invited to the first royal council at the end of the regency in November 1437.
York returned to England on 20 October 1445 at the end of his five-year appointment in France. He must have had reasonable expectations of reappointment. However, he had become associated with the English in Normandy who were opposed to the policy of Henry VI&#x27;s Council towards France, some of whom had followed him to England (for example, Sir William Oldhall and Sir Andrew Ogard). Eventually (on 24 December 1446) the lieutenancy went to Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, who had succeeded his brother John. During 1446 and 1447, York attended meetings of Henry VI&#x27;s Council and of Parliament, but most of his time was spent in the administration of his estates on the Welsh border.

York&#x27;s attitude toward the Council&#x27;s surrender of the French province of Maine, in return for an extension of the truce with France and a French bride for Henry, must have contributed to his appointment on 30 July 1447 as Lieutenant of Ireland. In some ways it was a logical appointment, as Richard was also Earl of Ulster and had considerable estates in Ireland, but it was also a convenient way of removing him from both England and France. His term of office was for ten years, ruling him out of consideration for any other high office during that period.

Domestic matters kept him in England until June 1449, but when he did eventually leave for Ireland, it was with Cecily (who was pregnant at the time) and an army of around 600 men. This suggests a stay of some time was envisaged. However, claiming a lack of money to defend English possessions, York decided to return to England. His financial state may indeed have been problematic, since by the mid-1440s he was owed £38,666 by the crown, (equivalent to £ in current value) and the income from his estates was declining.

==The Duke&#x27;s Opposition, 1450–1453==

In 1450, the defeats and failures of the English royal government of the previous ten years boiled over into serious political unrest. In January Adam Moleyns, Lord Privy Seal and Bishop of Chichester, was lynched. In May the chief councillor of the king, William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, was murdered on his way into exile. The House of Commons demanded that the king take back many of the grants of land and money he had made to his favourites.

In June, Kent and Sussex rose in revolt. Led by Jack Cade (taking the name Mortimer), they took control of London and killed James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele, the Lord High Treasurer of England. In August, the final towns held in Normandy fell to the French and refugees flooded back to England.

On 7 September, York landed at Beaumaris, Anglesey. Evading an attempt by Henry to intercept him, and gathering followers as he went, York arrived in London on 27 September. After an inconclusive (and possibly violent) meeting with the king, York continued to recruit, both in East Anglia and the west. The violence in London was such that Somerset, back in England after the collapse of English Normandy, was put in the Tower of London for his own safety. 

York&#x27;s public stance was that of a reformer, demanding better government and the prosecution of the &quot;traitors&quot; who had lost northern France. Judging by his later actions, there may also have been a more hidden motive—the destruction of Somerset, who was soon released from the Tower. York&#x27;s men made several attacks on the properties and servants of the Duke of Somerset, who was to be the focus of attack in parliament. 

York and his ally, the Duke of Norfolk, returned to London in November with large and threatening retinues. The London mob was mobilised to put pressure on parliament itself. However, although granted another office, that of Justice of the Forest south of the Trent, York still lacked any real support outside Parliament and his own retainers. In December Parliament elected York&#x27;s chamberlain, Sir William Oldhall, as speaker.

In April 1451, Somerset was released from the Tower and appointed Captain of Calais. One of York&#x27;s councillors, Thomas Young, the MP for Bristol, was sent to the Tower when he proposed that York be recognised as heir to the throne, and Parliament was dissolved. Henry VI was prompted into belated reforms, which went some way to restore public order and improve the royal finances. Frustrated by his lack of political power, York retired to Ludlow.

In 1452, York made another bid for power, but not to become king himself. Protesting his loyalty, he aimed to be recognised as Henry VI&#x27;s heir to the throne (Henry was childless after seven years of marriage), while also continuing to try to destroy the Duke of Somerset. Henry may have preferred Somerset to succeed him over York, as Somerset was a Beaufort descendant.

Gathering men on the march from Ludlow, York headed for London, only to find the city gates barred against him on Henry&#x27;s orders. At Dartford in Kent, with his army outnumbered, and the support of only two of the nobility (the Earl of Devon and Lord Cobham), York was forced to come to an agreement with Henry. He was allowed to present his complaints against Somerset to the king, but was then taken to London and after two weeks of virtual house arrest, was forced to swear an oath of allegiance at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

==Protector of the Realm, 1453–1455==
By the summer of 1453, York seemed to have lost his power struggle. Henry embarked on a series of judicial tours, punishing York&#x27;s tenants who had been involved in the debacle at Dartford. The queen consort, Margaret of Anjou, was pregnant, and even if she should miscarry, the marriage of the newly ennobled Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, to Margaret Beaufort provided for an alternative line of succession. By July, York had lost both of his offices, Lieutenant of Ireland and Justice of the Forest south of the Trent.

Then, in August 1453, Henry VI suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown, perhaps brought on by the news of the defeat at the Battle of Castillon in Gascony, which finally drove English forces from France. He became completely unresponsive, was unable to speak, and had to be led from room to room. The Council tried to carry on as though the king&#x27;s disability would be brief, but they had to admit eventually that something had to be done. In October, invitations for a Great Council were issued, and although Somerset tried to have him excluded, York (the premier duke of the realm) was included. Somerset&#x27;s fears were to prove well grounded, for in November he was committed to the Tower.

On 22 March 1454, Cardinal John Kemp, the Chancellor, died, making continued government in the King&#x27;s name constitutionally impossible. Henry could not be induced to respond to any suggestion as to who might replace Kemp. Despite the opposition of Margaret of Anjou, York was appointed Protector of the Realm and Chief Councillor on 27 March 1454. York&#x27;s appointment of his brother-in-law, Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, as Chancellor was significant. Henry&#x27;s burst of activity in 1453 had seen him try to stem the violence caused by various disputes between noble families. These disputes gradually polarised around the long-standing Percy–Neville feud. Unfortunately for Henry, Somerset (and therefore the king) became identified with the Percy cause. This drove the Nevilles into the arms of York, who now for the first time had support among a section of the nobility.

==Confrontation and aftermath, 1455–1456==
According to the historian Robin Storey: &quot;If Henry&#x27;s insanity was a tragedy, his recovery was a national disaster.&quot; When he recovered his reason in January 1455, after 17 months of near catatonia, Henry lost little time in reversing York&#x27;s actions. Somerset was released and restored to favour. York was deprived of the Captaincy of Calais (which was granted to Somerset once again) and of the office of Protector. Salisbury resigned as Chancellor. York, Salisbury, and Salisbury&#x27;s eldest son, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, were threatened when a Great Council was called to meet on 21 May in Leicester (away from Somerset&#x27;s enemies in London). York and his Neville relations recruited in the north and probably along the Welsh border. By the time Somerset realised what was happening, there was no time to raise a large force to support the king.

Once York took his army south of Leicester, thus barring the route to the Great Council, the dispute between him and the king regarding Somerset would have to be settled by force. On 22 May, the king and Somerset arrived at St Albans with a hastily assembled and poorly equipped army of around 2,000. York, Warwick, and Salisbury were already there with a larger and better-equipped army. More importantly, at least some of their soldiers would have had experience in the frequent border skirmishes with the Kingdom of Scotland and the occasionally rebellious people of Wales.

The First Battle of St Albans that followed hardly deserves the term battle. Possibly as few as 50 men were killed, but among them were some of the prominent leaders of the Lancastrian party, such as Somerset himself, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford. York and the Nevilles had therefore succeeded in killing their enemies, while York&#x27;s capture of the king gave him the chance to resume the power he had lost in 1453. It was vital to keep Henry alive, as his death would have led, not to York becoming king himself, but to the minority rule of Henry&#x27;s two-year-old son Edward of Westminster. Since York&#x27;s support among the nobility was small, he would be unable to dominate a minority Council led by Margaret of Anjou.

In the custody of York, the king was returned to London with York and Salisbury riding alongside, and with Warwick bearing the royal sword in front. On 25 May, Henry received the crown from York in a clearly symbolic display of power. York made himself Constable of England and appointed Warwick Captain of Calais. York&#x27;s position was enhanced when some of the nobility agreed to join his government, including Salisbury&#x27;s brother William Neville, Lord Fauconberg, who had served under York in France.

For the rest of the summer, York held the king prisoner, either in Hertford Castle or in London (to be enthroned in Parliament in July). When Parliament met again in November, the throne was empty, and it was reported that the king was ill again. York resumed the office of Protector; although he surrendered it when the king recovered in February 1456, it seemed that this time Henry was willing to accept that York and his supporters would play a major part in the government of the realm.

Salisbury and Warwick continued to serve as councillors, and Warwick was confirmed as Captain of Calais. In June, York himself was sent north to defend the border against a threatened invasion by James II of Scotland. However, the king once again came under the control of a dominant figure, this time one harder to replace than Suffolk or Somerset: for the rest of his reign, it would be the queen, Margaret of Anjou, who would control the king.

==Uneasy peace, 1456–1459==
Although Margaret of Anjou had now taken the place formerly held by Suffolk or Somerset, her position, at least at first, was not as dominant. York had his Lieutenancy of Ireland renewed, and he continued to attend meetings of the Council. However, in August 1456 the court moved to Coventry, in the heart of the queen&#x27;s lands. How York was treated now depended on how powerful the queen&#x27;s views were. York was regarded with suspicion on three fronts: he threatened the succession of the young Prince of Wales; he was apparently negotiating for the marriage of his eldest son Edward into the Burgundian ruling family; and as a supporter of the Nevilles, he was contributing to the major cause of disturbance in the kingdom—the Percy–Neville feud.

Here, the Nevilles lost ground. Salisbury gradually ceased to attend meetings of the council. When his brother Robert Neville, Bishop of Durham, died in 1457, the new appointment was Laurence Booth. Booth was a member of the queen&#x27;s inner circle. The Percys were shown greater favour both at court and in the struggle for power on the Scottish border.

Henry&#x27;s attempts at reconciliation between the factions divided by the killings at St Albans reached their climax with The Love Day on 25 March 1458. However, the lords concerned had earlier turned London into an armed camp, and the public expressions of amity seemed not to have lasted beyond the ceremony.

==Civil war breaks out, 1459==
In June 1459 a Great Council was summoned to meet at Coventry. York, the Nevilles and some other lords refused to appear, fearing that the armed forces that had been commanded to assemble the previous month had been summoned to arrest them. Instead, York and Salisbury recruited in their strongholds and met Warwick, who had brought with him his troops from Calais, at Worcester. Parliament was summoned to meet at Coventry in November, but without York and the Nevilles. This could only mean that they were to be accused of treason.

York and his supporters raised their armies, but they were initially dispersed throughout the country. Salisbury beat back a Lancastrian ambush at the Battle of Blore Heath on 23 September 1459, while his son Warwick evaded another army under the command of the Duke of Somerset, and afterwards, they both joined their forces with York. On 11 October, York tried to move south but was forced to head for Ludlow. On 12 October, at the Battle of Ludford Bridge, York once again faced Henry just as he had at Dartford seven years earlier. Warwick&#x27;s troops from Calais refused to fight, and the rebels fled—York to Ireland, Warwick, Salisbury, and York&#x27;s son Edward to Calais. York&#x27;s wife Cecily and their two younger sons (George and Richard) were captured in Ludlow Castle and imprisoned at Coventry.

==Wheel of fortune (1459–1460)==
York&#x27;s flight worked to his advantage. He was still Lieutenant of Ireland and attempts to replace him failed. The Parliament of Ireland backed him, providing offers of both military and financial support. Warwick&#x27;s (possibly inadvertent) return to Calais also proved fortunate. His control of the English Channel meant that pro-Yorkist propaganda, emphasising loyalty to the king while decrying his wicked councillors, could be spread around southern England. Such was the Yorkists&#x27; naval dominance that Warwick was able to sail to Ireland in March 1460, meet York and return to Calais in May. Warwick&#x27;s control of Calais was to prove to be influential with the wool merchants in London.

In December 1459 York, Warwick and Salisbury suffered attainder. Their lives were forfeit, and their lands reverted to the king; their heirs would not inherit. This was the most extreme punishment a member of the nobility could suffer, and York was now in the same situation as Henry of Bolingbroke (the future King Henry IV) in 1398. Only a successful invasion of England would restore his fortune. Assuming the invasion was successful, York had three options: become Protector again, disinherit the king&#x27;s son so that York would succeed, or claim the throne for himself.

On 26 June, Warwick and Salisbury landed at Sandwich. The men of Kent rose to join them. London opened its gates to the Nevilles on 2 July. They marched north into the Midlands, and on 10 July, they defeated the royal army at the Battle of Northampton (through treachery among the king&#x27;s troops), and captured Henry, whom they brought back to London.

York remained in Ireland. He did not set foot in England until 9 September, and when he did, he acted as a king. Marching under the arms of his maternal great-great-grandfather Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence, he displayed a banner of the coat of arms of England as he approached London.

A Parliament called to meet on 7 October repealed all the legislation of the Coventry parliament the previous year. On 10 October, York arrived in London and took residence in the royal palace. Entering Parliament with his sword borne upright before him, he made for the empty throne and placed his hand upon it, as if to occupy it. He may have expected the assembled peers to acclaim him as king, as they had acclaimed Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Instead, there was silence. Thomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, asked whether he wished to see the king. York replied, &quot;I know of no person in this realm the which oweth not to wait on me, rather than I of him.&quot; This high-handed reply did not impress the Lords.

The next day, Richard advanced his claim to the crown by hereditary right in proper form. However, his narrow support among his peers led to failure once again. After weeks of negotiation, the best that could be achieved was the Act of Accord, by which York and his heirs were recognised as Henry&#x27;s successors. However, in October 1460 Parliament did grant York extraordinary executive powers to protect the realm, and made him Lord Protector of England. He was also given the lands and income of the Prince of Wales, but was not granted the title itself or made Earl of Chester or Duke of Cornwall. With the king effectively in custody, York and Warwick were the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of the country.

==Final campaign and death==
While this was happening, the Lancastrian loyalists were rallying and arming in the north of England. Faced with the threat of attack from the Percys, and with Margaret of Anjou trying to gain the support of the new King of Scotland James III, York, Salisbury and York&#x27;s second son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, headed north on 2 December. They arrived at York&#x27;s stronghold of Sandal Castle on 21 December to find the situation bad and getting worse. Forces loyal to Henry controlled the city of York, and nearby Pontefract Castle was also in hostile hands. The Lancastrian armies were commanded by some of York&#x27;s implacable enemies such as Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland and John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford, whose fathers had been killed at the First Battle of St Albans, and included several northern lords who were jealous of York&#x27;s and Salisbury&#x27;s wealth and influence in the North.

On 30 December, York and his forces sortied from Sandal Castle. Their reasons for doing so are not clear; they were variously claimed to be a result of deception by the Lancastrian forces, or treachery by northern lords who York mistakenly believed to be his allies, or simple rashness on York&#x27;s part. The larger Lancastrian force destroyed York&#x27;s army in the resulting Battle of Wakefield. York was killed in the battle. The precise nature of his end was variously reported; he was either unhorsed, wounded and overcome fighting to the death or captured, given a mocking crown of bulrushes and then beheaded. Edmund of Rutland was intercepted as he tried to flee and was executed, possibly by Clifford in revenge for the death of his own father at the First Battle of St Albans. Salisbury escaped, but was captured and executed the following night.

York was buried at Pontefract, but his severed head was put on a pike by the victorious Lancastrian armies and displayed over Micklegate Bar at York, wearing a paper crown. His remains were later moved to Church of St Mary and All Saints, Fotheringhay.

==Legacy==
Within a few weeks of Richard of York&#x27;s death, his eldest surviving son was acclaimed King Edward IV and finally established the House of York on the throne following a decisive victory over the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton. After an occasionally tumultuous reign, he died in 1483 and was succeeded by his twelve-year-old son, Edward V, who was himself succeeded after 86 days by his uncle, York&#x27;s youngest son, Richard III.

Richard of York&#x27;s grandchildren included Edward V and Elizabeth of York. Elizabeth married Henry VII, founder of the Tudor dynasty, and became the mother of Henry VIII, Margaret Tudor and Mary Tudor. All future English monarchs would come from the line of Henry VII and Elizabeth, and therefore from Richard of York himself.

In theatre, Richard appears in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry VI, Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;.

Richard of York is the subject of the popular mnemonic &quot;Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain&quot; to remember the colours of a rainbow in order (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet—ROYGBIV).

<doc id="78357" wikidata="Q381459" url="?curid=78357" title="Agave (daughter of Cadmus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Agave (; or &#x27;high-born&#x27;), the daughter of Cadmus, was a princess of Thebes and the queen of the Maenads, followers of Dionysus (also known as Bacchus).

== Family ==
Agave was the eldest daughter of Cadmus, the king and founder of the city of Thebes, Greece, and of the goddess Harmonia. Her sisters were Autonoë, Ino and Semele, and her brother was Polydorus. Agave married Echion, one of the five Spartoi, and was the mother of Pentheus, a king of Thebes, and Epirus.

== Mythology ==
In Euripides&#x27; play &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, Theban Maenads murdered King Pentheus after he banned the worship of Dionysus because he denied Dionysus&#x27; divinity. Dionysus, Pentheus&#x27; cousin, lured Pentheus to the woods—Pentheus wanted to see what he thought were the sexual activities of the women—where the Maenads tore him apart and his corpse was mutilated by his own mother, Agave. Agave and Pentheus&#x27; aunt, Autonoe, tore him limb from limb in a Bacchic frenzy. Thinking that she and the other women had just killed a lion—for Dionysus had driven them mad—Agave carried her son&#x27;s head on a stick back to Thebes, only realizing the truth when confronted by her father, Cadmus.

This murder also served as Dionysus&#x27; vengeance on Agave (and her sisters Ino and Autonoë). Semele, during her pregnancy with Dionysus, was destroyed by the sight of the splendor of Zeus. Her sisters spread the report that she had only endeavored to conceal unmarried sex with a mortal man, by pretending that Zeus was the father of her child, and said that her destruction was a just punishment for her falsehood. This calumny was severely avenged upon Agave. After Dionysus, the son of Semele, had traversed the world, he came to Thebes and sent the Theban women mad, compelling them to celebrate his Dionysiac festivals on Mount Cithaeron. Pentheus, wishing to prevent or stop these riotous proceedings, was persuaded by a disguised Dionysus to go himself to Cithaeron, but was torn to pieces there by his own mother Agave, who in her frenzy believed him to be a wild lion.

For this transgression, according to Hyginus, Agave was exiled from Thebes and fled to Illyria to marry King Lycotherses, and then killed him in order to gain the city for her father Cadmus. According to William Smith, Hyginus&#x27; account is &quot;manifestly transplaced by Hyginus, and must have belonged to an earlier part of the story of Agave&quot;.

<doc id="78358" wikidata="Q729478" url="?curid=78358" title="Big Ten Conference">
<text>The Big Ten Conference (stylized B1G, formerly the Western Conference and the Big Nine Conference, among others) is a collegiate athletic conference in the United States. Founded as the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives in 1896, it predates the founding of its regulating organization, the NCAA; it is the oldest NCAA Division I conference in the country. It is based in the Chicago area in Rosemont, Illinois. For many decades the conference consisted of ten prominent universities, which accounts for its name. On August 2, 2024, the conference expanded to 18 member institutions and 2 affiliate institutions. The conference competes in the NCAA Division I and its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport.

Big Ten member institutions are major research universities with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations. A large student body is a hallmark of its universities, as 15 of the 18 members enroll more than 30,000 students. They are all public universities except Northwestern University and the University of Southern California, both private universities. Collectively, Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni. The members engage in $9.3 billion in funded research each year; 17 out of 18 are members of the Association of American Universities (except Nebraska) and the Universities Research Association (except USC). All Big Ten universities are also members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, formerly the Committee on Institutional Cooperation.

Although the Big Ten was primarily a Midwestern conference for nearly a century, the conference&#x27;s geographic footprint has extended from the Mid-Atlantic to the Great Plains since 2014. In 2024, the conference gained a presence in the West Coast with the addition of four former Pac-12 Conference schools.

==History==

===Early history===

As intercollegiate football rapidly increased during the 1890s, so did the ruthless nature of the game. Tempers flared, fights erupted, and injuries soared. Between 1880 and 1905, college football players suffered more than 325 deaths and 1,149 injuries. To deal with mounting criticism of the game, Purdue University president James Henry Smart invited the presidents of the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, Lake Forest College, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, and University of Wisconsin to a meeting in Chicago on January 11, 1895, to create policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. The eligibility of student-athletes was one of the main topics of discussion. The Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives was founded at a second meeting on February 8, 1896. Lake Forest was not at the 1896 meeting and was replaced by the University of Michigan. At the time, the organization was more commonly known as the Western Conference, consisting of Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Chicago, Purdue, and Northwestern. These schools were the original seven members.

The conference is one of the nation&#x27;s oldest, predating the founding of the NCAA by a decade and was one of the first collegiate conferences to sponsor men&#x27;s basketball.

The first reference to the conference as the Big Nine was in 1899 after Iowa and Indiana had joined. Nebraska first petitioned to join the league in 1900 and again in 1911, but was turned away both times.

In 1905, the conference was officially incorporated as the &quot;Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives&quot;.

In April 1907, Michigan was voted out of the conference for refusing to adhere to league rules limiting football teams to no more than five games and players to three years of eligibility. Ohio State joined in 1912. The first known references to the conference as the Big Ten were in December 1916, when Michigan rejoined the conference after a nine-year absence.

===1940s: Chicago leaves and Michigan State joins===
The conference was again known as the Big Nine after the University of Chicago decided to de-emphasize varsity athletics just after World War II. In 1939 UChicago President Robert Maynard Hutchins made the decision to abolish the football program, based on his negative views of big-time college football&#x27;s excesses and associated problems of the time. Chicago withdrew from the conference in 1946 after struggling to obtain victories in many conference matchups. It was believed that one of several schools, notably Iowa State, Marquette, Michigan State, Nebraska, Notre Dame, and Pittsburgh would replace Chicago at the time. On May 20, 1949, Michigan State ended the speculation by joining and the conference was again known as the Big Ten. The Big Ten&#x27;s membership would remain unchanged for the next 40 years. The conference&#x27;s official name throughout this period remained the Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives. It did not formally adopt the name &quot;Big Ten&quot; until 1987, when it was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation.

===1990 expansion: Penn State===

In 1990, the Big Ten universities voted to expand the conference to 11 teams and extended an invitation to Atlantic 10 Conference member and football independent Pennsylvania State University, which accepted it. When Penn State joined in 1990, it was decided the conference would continue to be called the Big Ten, but its logo was modified to reflect the change; the number 11 was disguised in the negative space of the traditionally blue &quot;Big Ten&quot; lettering.

Missouri showed interest in Big Ten membership after Penn State joined. Around 1993, the league explored adding Kansas, Missouri and Rutgers or other potential schools, to create a 14-team league with two football divisions. These talks died when the Big Eight Conference merged with former Southwest Conference members to create the Big 12.

Following the addition of Penn State, efforts were made to encourage the University of Notre Dame, at that time the last remaining non-service academy independent, to join the league. In 1999, Notre Dame and the Big Ten entered into private negotiations concerning a possible membership that would include Notre Dame. Although Notre Dame&#x27;s faculty senate endorsed the idea with a near-unanimous vote, the school&#x27;s board of trustees decided against joining the conference. (In 1926, Notre Dame had briefly considered official entry into the Big Ten but chose to retain its independent status.) Notre Dame subsequently joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in all sports except football (and hockey), in which Notre Dame maintains its independent status as long as it plays at least five games per season against ACC opponents. This was believed to be the major stumbling block to Notre Dame joining the Big Ten, as Notre Dame wanted to retain its independent home game broadcasting contract with NBC Sports, while the Big Ten insisted upon a full membership with no special exemptions.

===2010–2014 expansion: Nebraska, Maryland, Rutgers===

In December 2009, Big Ten Conference commissioner Jim Delany announced that the league was looking to expand in what would later be part of a nationwide trend as part of the 2010–2014 NCAA conference realignment. On June 11, 2010, the University of Nebraska applied for membership in the Big Ten and was unanimously approved as the conference&#x27;s 12th school, which became effective July 1, 2011. The conference retained the name &quot;Big Ten&quot;. This briefly led to the interesting and ironic result of the Big Ten consisting of twelve teams, and the Big 12 consisting of ten teams (with fellow former Big 12 member Colorado&#x27;s move to the Pac-12 Conference). As part of the agreement to join the Big Ten, Nebraska would not receive a full share of the media revenue for the first six years of its membership, until fall 2017.

====Legends and Leaders divisions====
On September 1, 2010, Delany revealed the conference&#x27;s football divisional split, but noted that the division names would be announced later. Those division names, as well as the conference&#x27;s new logo, were made public on December 13, 2010. For its new logo, the conference replaced the &quot;hidden 11&quot; logo with one that uses the &quot;B1G&quot; character combination in its branding. Delany did not comment on the logo that day, but it was immediately evident that the new logo would &quot;allow fans to see &#x27;BIG&#x27; and &#x27;10&#x27; in a single word.&quot;

For the new football division names, the Big Ten was unable to use geographic names, because they had rejected a geographic arrangement. Delany announced that the new divisions would be known as the &quot;Legends Division&quot; and &quot;Leaders Division&quot;. In the Legends division were Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Nebraska and Northwestern. The Leaders division was composed of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue and Wisconsin. Conference officials stated they had focused on creating competitive fairness rather than splitting by geographical location. However, the new &quot;Legends&quot; and &quot;Leaders&quot; divisions were not met with enthusiasm. Some traditional rivals, including Ohio State and Michigan, were placed in separate divisions.

For the football season, each team played the others in its division, one &quot;cross-over&quot; rivalry game, and two rotating cross-divisional games. At the end of the regular season the two division winners met in a new Big Ten Football Championship Game. The Legends and Leaders divisional alignment was in effect for the 2011, 2012 and 2013 football seasons.

====Maryland and Rutgers join====

On November 19, 2012, the University of Maryland&#x27;s Board of Regents voted to withdraw from the ACC and join the Big Ten as its 13th member effective on July 1, 2014. The Big Ten&#x27;s Council of Presidents approved the move later that day. One day later, Rutgers University of the Big East also accepted an offer for membership from the Big Ten as its 14th member school. Like Nebraska, both schools would not receive full shares of the media revenue until six years after they joined. However, both schools took loans from the conference, thus pushing back the date they would receive full shares.

====West and East divisions====
On April 28, 2013, the Big Ten presidents and chancellors unanimously approved a football divisional realignment that went into effect when Maryland and Rutgers joined in 2014. Under the new plan, the Legends and Leaders divisions were replaced with geographic divisions. The West Division included Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Northwestern, Purdue and Wisconsin (of which all but Purdue are in the Central Time Zone), while the East Division included Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, Ohio State, Penn State and Rutgers (all of which are in the Eastern Time Zone). The final issue in determining the new divisions was which of the two Indiana schools would be sent to the West; Purdue was chosen because its West Lafayette campus is geographically west of Indiana&#x27;s home city of Bloomington. The divisional alignment permanently protected the cross-divisional football rivalry Indiana–Purdue. As before, the two division winners played each other in the Big Ten Football Championship Game. The West and East divisional alignment was in effect for ten football seasons, from 2014 through 2023.

On June 3, 2013, the Big Ten announced the sponsorship of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse. For any conference to qualify for an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, at least six member schools must play the sport. In women&#x27;s lacrosse, the addition of Maryland and Rutgers to the Big Ten brought the conference up to the requisite six participants, joining programs at Michigan, Northwestern, Ohio State and Penn State. In men&#x27;s lacrosse, Ohio State and Penn State were the only existing participants. Coincident with the addition of Maryland and Rutgers, Michigan agreed to upgrade its successful club team to varsity status, giving the Big Ten five sponsoring schools, one short of the minimum six for an automatic bid. Johns Hopkins University opted to join the conference as its first affiliate member beginning in 2014. Johns Hopkins had been independent in men&#x27;s lacrosse for 130 years, claiming 44 national championships. As long-time independents joined conferences (for example, Syracuse joining the Atlantic Coast Conference), other schools competing as independents in some cases concluded that the inability to earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament was becoming a more serious competitive disadvantage in scheduling and recruiting.

On March 23, 2016, the Big Ten Conference and Notre Dame announced the Fighting Irish would become a men&#x27;s ice hockey affiliate beginning with the 2017–18 season. Notre Dame had been a member of Hockey East, and the move would save travel time and renew rivalries with former CCHA and WCHA members.
In 2013, the conference moved its headquarters from its location in Park Ridge, Illinois to neighboring Rosemont. The office building is situated within Rosemont&#x27;s Parkway Bank Park Entertainment District (then named MB Financial Park Entertainment District), alongside Interstate 294.

===2021–2024 Pacific expansion===

On June 30, 2022, UCLA and USC announced that they would be joining the Big Ten Conference effective August 2, 2024, enabling both schools to remain in the Pac-12 Conference for the duration of the Pac-12&#x27;s existing media rights agreements. Unlike the prior expansion with Nebraska, Rutgers, and Maryland, USC and UCLA would join with a full share of the media revenue from the start of their Big Ten tenure.

In August 2022, the conference reached new media rights deals with CBS, Fox, and NBC totaled at an estimated $7 billion.

On August 4, 2023, Oregon and Washington announced that they would join the Big Ten Conference alongside UCLA and USC. Unlike UCLA and USC, the two schools would receive a reduced media revenue share of $30 million each, with the share increasing by $1 million for each school each year, through the 2029–30 season. Rather than reducing the other conference members&#x27; revenue shares, Fox would contribute the necessary money. The schools will receive a full share with the next media deal.

====Football: the return of no divisions====

In June 2023 – after UCLA and USC were confirmed as incoming members but before Oregon and Washington were added – the conference announced that starting in 2024, the East and West divisions for football would be eliminated. Each team would play nine conference games and three non-conference games, as before. Within a four-year period, each team would play at least two games against every other team – one at home and one away. This plan called for 11 protected matchups to take place every year; these included Michigan–Ohio State and ten other regional rivalries. At the end of each season, the top two teams in the conference standings would oppose each other in the Big Ten Football Championship Game.

The addition of Oregon and Washington added one more protected matchup to this count, bringing the total to 12 protected matchups: Illinois–Northwestern, Illinois–Purdue, Indiana–Purdue, Iowa–Minnesota, Iowa–Nebraska, Iowa–Wisconsin, Maryland–Rutgers, Michigan–Michigan State, Michigan–Ohio State, Minnesota–Wisconsin, Oregon–Washington and UCLA–USC, leaving Penn State as the lone school with no protected matchups. The schedule was also updated so that teams will play every other conference opponent at least twice – once home and once away – and will play rotating opponents no more than three times in a five-year period.

==Academics==

All current members of the Big Ten are doctorate-granting universities.

Former conference commissioner Jim Delany said in 2010 that membership in the Association of American Universities is &quot;an important part of who we are.&quot; All current members of the Big Ten, other than the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, are members of the AAU. Nebraska was a member of the AAU when it was admitted to the Big Ten, but lost this status shortly afterwards.

The following table shows National University rank by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; .

Also indicated is membership in the Association of American Universities.

==Commissioners==
The office of the commissioner of athletics was created in 1922 &quot;to study athletic problems of the various member universities and assist in enforcing the eligibility rules which govern Big Ten athletics.&quot;

All Big Ten members are members of the Big Ten Academic Alliance, formerly known as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. The University of Chicago, a former Big Ten Conference member, was a member of the CIC from 1958 to June 29, 2016.

==Athletic department revenue by school==
Total revenue includes ticket sales, contributions and donations, rights and licensing, student fees, school funds and all other sources including TV income, camp income, concessions, and novelties.

Total expenses includes coach and staff salaries, scholarships, buildings and grounds, maintenance, utilities and rental fees, recruiting, team travel, equipment and uniforms, conference dues, and insurance.

The following table shows institutional reporting to the United States Department of Education as shown on the DOE Equity in Athletics website for the 2022–23 academic year.

==Broadcasting and media rights==
===Fall 2007-Spring 2017===
Commissioner Jim Delany began to explore the formation of a Big Ten-specific channel in 2004 after a failed attempt to seek a significantly larger rights fee from ESPN to renew its existing agreements. This came to fruition in 2006, when the conference announced the formation of a dedicated cable network, Big Ten Network, in a 20-year partnership with Fox Sports, which would officially launch in 2007. The network carries coverage of Big Ten athletics (including events not carried by the Big Ten&#x27;s other media partners), studio shows, as well as other original programs and documentaries profiling the conference and its members. The impact of Big Ten Network influenced the conference&#x27;s expansion in the 2010s, with some of its newer members being located in proximity to major media markets such as Baltimore and Washington, D.C. (Maryland) and the New York metropolitan area (Rutgers).

Accompanying the new network announcement was a new ten-year media rights agreement beginning with the 2007–08 season and ending with the 2016–17 season that would split Big Ten coverage among the ESPN networks, CBS Sports, and Big Ten Network, thus ending Comcast Chicago&#x27;s regional coverage of the conference.

In 2010, the Big Ten announced the creation of the Big Ten Football Championship game starting with the 2011 season and signed a broadcast deal with Fox to broadcast the game from 2011 through 2016.

===Fall 2017-Spring 2023===
In 2016, the conference announced a new six-year media rights deal worth $2.64 billion with Fox Sports, CBS Sports, and ESPN to take effect with the start of the 2017–18 season and ending with the 2022–23 season. The size of the deal translated to a near tripling of the per-school media revenue share.

The new deal would see regular season Big Ten football games airing on Fox and Fox Sports 1 for the first time. As part of the deal, Fox would retain its coverage of the Big Ten Championship as well as obtain priority over ESPN when drafting regular season football games prior to each season. It would also put an end to ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the Big Ten men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

===Fall 2023-Spring 2030===
On August 18, 2022, the Big Ten announced that it had reached seven-year broadcast rights deals with Fox, CBS, and for the first time, NBC Sports, beginning in the 2023–24 academic year, ending an association between the conference and ESPN dating back to the 1980s. A major goal for the new contracts was to establish specific broadcast windows for Big Ten football games across its three partners, with Fox, CBS, and NBC primarily holding rights to Noon ET, 3:30 p.m. ET, and primetime games, respectively, and the three broadcasters alternating first pick of games. The contracts were estimated to be worth at least $7 billion, but also reportedly includes an &quot;escalator clause&quot; that will raise the value of the contracts if the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were to specifically join the Big Ten.
*Fox Sports:
** 24 to 32 football games per season:
*** Will primarily air in a Noon ET window (&quot;Big Noon Saturday&quot;), but with the option for games in other windows after the West Coast schools join in 2024.
*** Rights to the Big Ten championship game in 2023, 2025, 2027, and 2029.
** At least 45 men&#x27;s basketball games per-season on Fox and FS1.
** Selected women&#x27;s basketball games and Olympic sport events.
*CBS Sports:
** 14 to 15 football games per season on CBS and Paramount+:
*** Will primarily air in a 3:30 p.m. ET window beginning in 2024, once CBS&#x27;s contract with the SEC expires (CBS will air seven games in other timeslots during the 2023 season). 
*** Includes one Friday afternoon game on Thanksgiving weekend.
*** Rights to the Big Ten championship game in 2024 and 2028.
** Up to 15 men&#x27;s basketball games per-season:
*** Rights to the semi-finals and championship game of the Big Ten men&#x27;s basketball tournament
*** Rights to the championship game of the Big Ten women&#x27;s basketball tournament
*NBC Sports:
** 14 to 16 football games per season on NBC and Peacock:
*** Games will primarily air in a primetime window on NBC
*** Eight games will stream exclusively on Peacock, including four intraconference games.
*** Rights to the Big Ten championship game in 2026
** Up to 77 basketball games per-season on Peacock:
*** Up to 47 men&#x27;s basketball games, including 32 intraconference games.
*** Up to 30 women&#x27;s basketball games, including 20 intraconference games.
*** Rights to the opening night doubleheaders of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournaments.
** Up to 40 live Olympic sports events per-season on Peacock.
*Big Ten Network:
** Up to 50 football games per season
** At least 126 men&#x27;s basketball games per season
*** Second round and quarter-final games of the Big Ten men&#x27;s basketball tournament
** At least 40 women&#x27;s basketball games per season
*** Coverage of the Big Ten women&#x27;s basketball tournament (outside of the first round and championship game)
** Coverage of Olympic sports events

Following the deal&#x27;s signing, it was later revealed that several schools had issues with playing football games at night in November, with some having formal clauses allowing them to veto games in that timeslot. The conference would also have to compensate Fox $40 million for the 2026 Big Ten championship game, as the conference did not actually have the right to offer the game to NBC. Instead, under the terms of the agreement regarding the operation of Big Ten Network, the channel officially owns the conference&#x27;s media rights and then sublicenses them out to other channels, thus Fox has a stake in any content BTN sublicenses.

In 2024, NBC aired some of its Big Ten basketball games on its broadcast network, rather than Peacock.

==Sports==
The Big Ten Conference sponsors championship competition in 14 men&#x27;s and 14 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports.

===Men&#x27;s sponsored sports by school===

Notes:

* Notre Dame joined the Big Ten in the 2017–18 school year as an affiliate member in men&#x27;s ice hockey. It continues to field its other sports in the ACC except in football where it will continue to compete as an independent.

° Johns Hopkins joined the Big Ten in 2014 as an affiliate member in men&#x27;s lacrosse, with women&#x27;s lacrosse following in 2016. It continues to field its other sports in the NCAA Division III Centennial Conference.

==Rivalries==

===Intra-conference football rivalries===
The members of the Big Ten have longstanding rivalries with each other, especially on the football field. Each school, except Maryland and Rutgers, has at least one traveling trophy at stake. The following is a list of active rivalries in the Big Ten Conference with totals &amp; records through the completion of the 2022 season.
===Extra-conference football rivalries===
===Protected matchups===
Beginning in 2024, the conference will eliminate divisions but will protect certain matchups. The following are the conference&#x27;s 12 protected matchups.

* Illinois: Northwestern, Purdue
* Indiana: Purdue
* Iowa: Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin
* Maryland: Rutgers
* Michigan: Michigan State, Ohio State
* Michigan State: Michigan
* Minnesota: Iowa, Wisconsin
* Nebraska: Iowa
* Northwestern: Illinois
* Ohio State: Michigan
* Oregon: Washington
* Purdue: Illinois, Indiana
* Rutgers: Maryland
* UCLA: USC
* USC: UCLA
* Washington: Oregon
* Wisconsin: Minnesota, Iowa

From 1993 through 2010, the Big Ten football schedule was set up with each team having two permanent matches within the conference, with the other eight teams in the conference rotating out of the schedule in pairs for two-year stints. Permanent matches were as follows:
* Illinois: Indiana, Northwestern
* Indiana: Illinois, Purdue
* Iowa: Minnesota, Wisconsin
* Michigan: Michigan State, Ohio State
* Michigan State: Michigan, Penn State
* Minnesota: Iowa, Wisconsin
* Northwestern: Illinois, Purdue
* Ohio State: Michigan, Penn State
* Penn State: Michigan State, Ohio State
* Purdue: Indiana, Northwestern
* Wisconsin: Iowa, Minnesota

This system was discontinued after the 2010 season, as teams became grouped into two divisions, and would play all teams in their division once, with one protected cross-over game, and two games rotating against the other five opponents from the opposing division.

Most of the above permanent rivalries were maintained. By virtue of the new alignment, a handful of new permanent divisional opponents were created, as all pairs of teams within the same division would face off each season. Furthermore, three new permanent inter-divisional matches resulted from the realignment: Purdue–Iowa, Michigan State–Indiana, and Penn State–Nebraska. The following past permanent matches were maintained across divisions: Minnesota–Wisconsin, Michigan–Ohio State, and Illinois–Northwestern.

The new alignment, however, caused some of the above permanent rivalries to be discontinued. These were: Iowa–Wisconsin, Northwestern–Purdue, and Michigan State–Penn State. These matchups would continue to be played, but only twice every five years on average. More rivalries were disrupted, and some resumed on a yearly basis, when the league realigned into East and West Divisions for the 2014 season with the addition of Maryland and Rutgers. The two new schools were placed in the new East Division with Penn State, and the two Indiana schools were divided (Indiana to the East and Purdue to the West). With the move to a nine-game conference schedule in 2016, all cross-division games will be held at least once in a four-year cycle except for Indiana–Purdue, which is the only protected cross-division game. The conference later announced that once the new scheduling format takes effect in 2016, members will be prohibited from playing FCS teams, and required to play at least one non-conference game against a team in the Power Five conferences (ACC, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC; presumably, this would also allow for non-conference games against Big Ten opponents that are not on the conference schedule). Games against independents Notre Dame (an ACC member in non-football sports) also count toward the Power Five requirement, as did games against BYU before it joined the Big 12 in 2023.

===Extra-conference rivalries===
Four Big Ten teams-Purdue, Northwestern, Michigan State and Michigan-had rivalries in football with Notre Dame. After the University of Southern California with 35 wins (including a vacated 2005 win), the Michigan State Spartans have the most wins against the Irish, with 28. The Purdue Boilermakers follow with 26, and Michigan ranks fourth all-time with 24. Northwestern and Notre Dame had a yearly contest, with the winner taking home a shillelagh, much like the winner of the USC–Notre Dame and Purdue–Notre Dame contests now receive. The Northwestern–Notre Dame shillelagh was largely forgotten by the early 1960s and is now solely an element of college football&#x27;s storied past.

Penn State has a longstanding rivalry with Pittsburgh of the ACC, but the two schools did not meet from 2000 until renewing the rivalry with an alternating home-and-home series from 2016 to 2019. Penn State also has long histories with independent Notre Dame; Temple of The American; Syracuse, and Boston College of the ACC; and West Virginia, of the Big 12 Conference. Additionally, Penn State maintains strong intrastate rivalries with Patriot League universities Bucknell in men&#x27;s basketball and men&#x27;s lacrosse, and Lehigh in wrestling. Most of these rivalries were cultivated while Penn State operated independent of conference affiliation; the constraints of playing a full conference schedule, especially in football, have reduced the number of meetings between Penn State and its non-Big Ten rivals.

Iowa has an in-state rivalry with Iowa State of the Big 12, with the winner getting the Cy-Hawk Trophy in football. Iowa and Iowa State also compete annually in the Cy-Hawk Series sponsored by Hy-Vee (as of 2011 this series is now sponsored by The Iowa Corngrowers Association), the competition includes all head-to-head regular season competitions in all sports. Iowa also holds rivalries in basketball with the state&#x27;s other two Division I programs, Drake and Northern Iowa.

Indiana has an out-of-conference rivalry with Kentucky of the SEC (see Indiana–Kentucky rivalry). While the two schools played in football for many years, the rivalry was rooted in their decades of national success in men&#x27;s basketball. The two no longer play one another in football, but their basketball rivalry continued until a dispute about game sites ended the series after 2011. In the last season of the rivalry (2011–12), the teams played twice. During the regular season, then-unranked Indiana defeated then-#1 ranked Kentucky 73–72 at Assembly Hall. The Wildcats avenged the loss in the NCAA tournament, defeating Indiana 102–90 in the South Regional final in Atlanta on their way to a national title. The teams next played in the 2016 NCAA tournament, with Indiana winning.

Illinois has a longstanding basketball rivalry with the SEC&#x27;s Missouri Tigers, with the two men&#x27;s teams squaring off annually in the &quot;Braggin&#x27; Rights&quot; game. It has been held in St. Louis since 1980, first at the St. Louis Arena and since 1994 at the Enterprise Center. This rivalry has been carried over into football as &quot;The Arch Rivalry&quot; with games played at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis in 2002 and 2003 and four games in 2007 through 2010.

Wisconsin has a long-standing in-state basketball rivalry with Marquette. The series has intensified as of late with both teams having made the Final Four in recent years. The schools also played an annual football game before Marquette abandoned its football program in 1961. The school also has minor rivalries in basketball with the two other Division I members of the University of Wisconsin System, which include the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and University of Wisconsin–Green Bay.

Similarly, Nebraska has an in-state rivalry with another Big East school in Creighton, mostly in basketball and baseball.

Minnesota men&#x27;s ice hockey has a prolific and fierce border rivalry with the University of North Dakota. The two teams played annually between 1948 and 2013 as members of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association prior to the inception of the Big Ten Conference. The rivalry resumed in 2016 in non-conference action.

Maryland has many rivalries outside of the conference, most notably Duke, Virginia, West Virginia, and Navy. Maryland left the Duke and Virginia rivalries behind in the ACC when it joined the Big Ten.

In the early days of the Big Ten, the Chicago-Michigan game was played on Thanksgiving, usually with conference championship implications. It was considered one of the first major rivalries of the conference.

==Facilities==
Three Big Ten football stadiums seat over 100,000 spectators: Michigan Stadium (Michigan), Beaver Stadium (Penn State), and Ohio Stadium (Ohio State). Only five other college football stadiums have a capacity over 100,000 (as of the 2024 season, all in the Southeastern Conference (SEC)). Michigan Stadium and Beaver Stadium, respectively, are the two largest American football stadiums by capacity in the United States, and all three of the Big Ten&#x27;s largest venues rank among the ten largest sports stadiums in the world. UCLA plays in the Rose Bowl as its home stadium, which is the location of the Rose Bowl Game for the Big Ten champion. USC plays in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a publicly owned stadium that is managed and operated by the university, which has hosted two summer Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984, and will again in 2028.

Big Ten schools also play in two of the 10 largest on-campus basketball arenas in the country: Ohio State&#x27;s Value City Arena and Maryland&#x27;s Xfinity Center. Additionally, arenas at Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and Penn State rank among the 20 largest on-campus basketball facilities in the United States. As of the upcoming 2024–25 season, the Big Ten Conference has the most on-campus basketball arenas with seating capacities of 15,000 or more of any NCAA conference, with seven. (Of the other conferences considered &quot;power conferences&quot; in men&#x27;s basketball, the ACC has two such arenas, the Big East none, the Big 12 four, and the SEC five. Outside of these conferences, the Mountain West Conference has four such arenas.)

==Football==
When Maryland and Rutgers joined the Big Ten in 2014, the division names were changed to &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot;, with Purdue and the six schools in the Central Time Zone in the West and Indiana joining the remaining six Eastern Time Zone schools in the East. The only protected cross-division game is Indiana–Purdue. Beginning in 2016, the Big Ten adopted a nine-game conference schedule. All teams have one cross-division opponent they play annually that changes every six years except for Indiana and Purdue, whose crossover is permanent. The other six opponents are played every three years during that cycle. For 2016–2021, the pairings are Maryland-Minnesota, Michigan-Wisconsin, Michigan State-Northwestern, Ohio State-Nebraska, Penn State-Iowa, and Rutgers-Illinois, and for 2022–2023 the pairings are Maryland-Northwestern, Michigan-Nebraska, Michigan State-Minnesota, Ohio State-Wisconsin, Penn State-Illinois, and Rutgers-Iowa. In 2016, the Big Ten no longer allowed its members to play Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) teams and also requires at least one non-conference game against a school in the Power Five conferences (ACC, Big 12, Pac-12, SEC). Contracts for future games already scheduled against FCS teams would be honored. However, in 2017, the Big Ten started to allow teams to schedule an FCS opponent during years in which they only have four conference home games (odd-numbered years for East division teams, even-numbered years for West division teams). At the time this policy was first announced, games against FBS independents Notre Dame and BYU would count toward the Power Five requirement. ESPN, citing a Big Ten executive, reported in 2015 that the Big Ten would allow exceptions to the Power Five rule on a case-by-case basis, and also that the other FBS independent at that time, Army, had been added to the list of non-Power Five schools that would be counted as Power Five opponents.

In 2024, the addition of Oregon, UCLA, USC, and Washington expanded the Big Ten to 18 teams, resulting in the elimination of football divisions. A schedule consisting of nine conference games and three non-conference games was maintained. At the end of the season, the top two teams in the conference standings will play each other in the Big Ten Football Championship Game. For at least 2024 and 2025, the conference was to adopt what it called the &quot;Flex Protect Plus&quot; model, which called for each conference member to play all the others at home and away at least once during a four-year cycle. Initially, the 11 &quot;protected&quot; matchups were to be played each season. The announcement was made before Oregon and Washington were announced as incoming members. After the expansion to 18 teams was announced, the scheduling model was tweaked into the &quot;Flex Protect XVIII&quot; model, which will maintain the original 11 protected rivalries while adding Oregon–Washington. This model is planned to operate from 2024 to 2028.

===Big Ten Conference champions===
===Bowl games===
Since 1946, the Big Ten champion has had a tie-in with the Rose Bowl game. Michigan appeared in the first bowl game, the 1902 Rose Bowl. After that, the Big Ten only allowed one other team to participate in the Rose Bowl (the 1920 Ohio State Buckeyes football team), until the agreement struck with the Pacific Coast Conference for the 1947 Rose Bowl. The spread of civilian air travel plus the fact that the US military had publicly encouraged college football during World War II were primary causes of the Big Ten finally allowing the Rose Bowl. From 1946 through 1971, the Big Ten did not allow the same team to represent the conference in consecutive years in the Rose Bowl with an exception made after the 1961 season in which Minnesota played in the 1962 Rose Bowl after playing in the 1961 Rose Bowl due to Ohio State declining the bid because of Ohio State faculty concerns about academics.

It was not until the 1975 season that the Big Ten allowed teams to play in bowl games other than the Rose Bowl. Michigan, which had been shut out of the postseason the previous three years, was the first beneficiary of the new rule when it played in the Orange Bowl vs. Oklahoma. Due to the pre-1975 rules, Big Ten teams such as Michigan and Ohio State have lower numbers of all-time bowl appearances than powerhouse teams from the Big 12 Conference (previously Big Eight and Southwest Conferences) and Southeastern Conference, which always placed multiple teams in bowl games every year.

==== 2025 Bowl Tie-ins ====
====Bowl selection procedures====
Although the pick order usually corresponds to the conference standings, the bowls are not required to make their choices strictly according to the win–loss records; many factors influence bowl selections, especially the likely turnout of the team&#x27;s fans. Picks are made after CFP selections; the bowl with the #2 pick will have the first pick of the remaining teams in the conference.

For all non-College Football Playoff partners, the bowl partner will request a Big Ten team. The Big Ten will approve or assign another team based on internal selection parameters.

When not hosting a semifinal, the Orange Bowl will select the highest-ranked team from the Big Ten, SEC or Notre Dame to face an ACC opponent. (However, in an 8-game cycle [12 years due to not counting when the Orange Bowl is a semifinal], the Big Ten must be selected at least three times and no more than four times; the SEC similarly will be selected between three and four times while Notre Dame may be selected up to two times.) The Big Ten Champion cannot play in the Orange Bowl. If a Big Ten team is not selected by the Orange Bowl, the Citrus Bowl will submit a request for a Big Ten team.

===Head Coach Compensation===
Guaranteed compensation is due to the coaches regardless of performance. Though most of the pay is directed from the university, some also comes in the form of guaranteed endorsements and other income streams. Most coaches also have performance-based bonuses that can significantly raise their salaries.

In 2024, three Big Ten member schools—Northwestern and USC, private institutions, and Penn State, exempt from most open records laws due to its status as what Pennsylvania calls a &quot;state-related&quot; institution—are not obligated to provide salary information for their head coaches. Both Penn State and Northwestern typically choose to provide this information, although Northwestern has not announced the salary of its current coach.

===Marching bands===
All Big Ten member schools have marching bands which perform regularly during the football season. Eleven of the member schools have won the Sudler Trophy, generally considered the most prestigious honor a collegiate marching band can receive. The first three Sudler trophies were awarded to Big Ten marching bands—Michigan (1982), Illinois (1983) and Ohio State (1984). The Big Ten has more Sudler Trophy recipients than any other collegiate athletic conference.

===Conference individual honors===
Coaches and media of the Big Ten Conference award individual honors at the end of each football season.

==Men&#x27;s basketball==
The Big Ten has participated in basketball since 1904, and has led the nation in attendance every season since 1978. Although, they have slightly higher average capacity basketball venues, the attendance edge is largely because Big Ten Conference fans fill a higher percentage of seats than other conferences. It has been a national powerhouse in men&#x27;s basketball, having multiple championship winners and often sending four or more teams to the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Previous NCAA champions include Indiana with five titles, Michigan State with two, and Wisconsin, Michigan, and Ohio State with one each. Maryland, which joined the Big Ten in 2014, won one NCAA championship as a member of the ACC. Ohio State played in the first NCAA tournament national championship game in 1939, losing to Oregon. Despite this, Jimmy Hull of Ohio State was the first NCAA tournament MVP. The first three tournament MVPs came from the Big Ten (Marv Huffman of Indiana in 1940 and John Katz of Wisconsin in 1941).

Big Ten teams have also experienced success in the postseason National Invitation Tournament (NIT). Since 1974, 13 Big Ten teams have played in the championship game, winning nine championships. Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State, and Minnesota have won two NIT championships, while Indiana and Purdue have won one each. Two other members, Maryland and Nebraska, won NIT titles before they joined the Big Ten. In addition, in 1943 the defunct Helms Athletic Foundation retrospectively awarded national titles to Northwestern for 1931 and Purdue for 1932; then in 1957, it selected Illinois for 1915, Minnesota for 1902 and 1919, and Wisconsin for 1912, 1914 and 1916. Former member Chicago won a post-season national championship series in 1908.

===Conference Challenges===
From 1999 to 2022, the Big Ten took part in the ACC–Big Ten Challenge with the Atlantic Coast Conference. The ACC held a 13–8–3 record against the Big Ten; Minnesota, Nebraska, Penn State, Purdue, and Wisconsin are the only Big Ten schools without losing records in the challenge.

From 2015 to 2023, the Big Ten took part in the Gavitt Tipoff Games with the Big East Conference. The Big Ten did well in the challenge, holding a 3–1–4 record against the Big East, only losing the challenge in 2021.

===All-time school records===
This list is updated through March 1, 2022 and is listed by win percentage in NCAA Division I men&#x27;s college basketball.
† Minnesota vacated its 1997 Big Ten Conference regular season title, Michigan vacated its 1998 Big Ten tournament title, and Ohio State vacated its 2002 Big Ten tournament, as well as 2000 and 2002 regular season titles, due to NCAA sanctions. Minnesota was the champion for both the Premo-Porretta Power Poll and the Helms Athletic Foundation in 1902, but was only the Premo-Porretta champion in 1903 and only the Helms champion in 1919.

===National championships, Final Fours, and NCAA tournament appearances===
Big Ten Conference basketball programs have combined to win 10 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball championships as Big Ten members, with another current member having won a national championship before joining the conference. UCLA has won eleven, Indiana has won five, Michigan State has won two, while Michigan, Ohio State and Wisconsin have won one national championship each as Big Ten members. Maryland won one national championship while a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, and Oregon won the first NCAA tournament in 1939. Fifteen teams have advanced to the Final Four at least once in their history. Ten Big Ten schools (Indiana, Michigan State, Illinois, Purdue, Ohio State, Maryland, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, and UCLA) are among the national top 50 in all-time NCAA tournament appearances.

===Head Coach Compensation===
Guaranteed compensation is due to the coaches regardless of performance. Though most of the pay is directed from the university, some also comes in the form of guaranteed endorsements and other income streams. Most coaches also have performance-based bonuses that can significantly raise their salaries.

In 2024, three Big Ten member schools—Northwestern and USC, private institutions, and Penn State, exempt from most open records laws due to its status as what Pennsylvania calls a &quot;state-related&quot; institution—are not obligated to provide salary information for their head coaches. Despite this, both Penn State and Northwestern typically choose to provide this information.

==Women&#x27;s basketball==
Big Ten women&#x27;s basketball teams have played a total of 17 championship games of the three most prominent national postseason tournaments—six in the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament (since 1982), one in the Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitation Tournament (since 2024), and 10 in the Women&#x27;s National Invitation Tournament (since 1998). Three other championship game appearances (two in the NCAA, one in the WNIT) were made by current Big Ten members before they joined the conference, and the 2024 arrivals have combined for five championship game appearances (three in the NCAA and two in the WNIT). Purdue is the only Big Ten member to have won the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball national title while a member of the conference. Both schools that joined in 2014, Maryland and Rutgers, won national titles before joining the Big Ten—Rutgers won the final AIAW championship in 1982, when it was a member of the Eastern 8, and Maryland won the NCAA title in 2006 as a member of the ACC. Big Ten women&#x27;s basketball led conference attendance from 1993 to 1999.

Like the men&#x27;s teams, the women&#x27;s basketball teams in the Big Ten participated in the Big Ten–ACC Women&#x27;s Challenge, which was founded in 2007 and ended in 2022. The Big Ten&#x27;s record in the challenge was 1–11–3, with Indiana, Maryland, and Michigan being the only Big Ten teams without a losing record in the challenge.

==Field hockey==
Big Ten field hockey programs have won 11 NCAA Championships, although only three of these titles were won by schools as Big Ten members. Maryland won eight national championships as a member of the ACC, second most in the sport all-time. Penn State&#x27;s two AIAW championships were also won before it became a Big Ten member and before the NCAA sponsored women&#x27;s sports.
==Men&#x27;s gymnastics==
The Big Ten fields five of the remaining 13 Division I men&#x27;s gymnastics teams. In 2014, Michigan edged out Oklahoma for their 6th NCAA men&#x27;s gymnastics championship, the school&#x27;s third in five years.

†††–Michigan State no longer competes in gymnastics.

==Men&#x27;s ice hockey==
The Big Ten began sponsoring men&#x27;s ice hockey in the 2013–14 season, the only Power Five conference to do so. The inaugural season included six schools: Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State joined from the disbanded CCHA; Minnesota and Wisconsin joined from the WCHA; and Penn State joined after playing its first NCAA Division I season (2012–13) as an independent. Notre Dame joined the league as an affiliate member beginning with the 2017–18 season. Arizona State had a scheduling agreement with the conference for the 2020–21 season as an all-away game team, playing all seven Big Ten squads four times, but was not part of the conference and therefore was ineligible for the conference tournament or associated NCAA tournament automatic berth. ASU joined the National Collegiate Hockey Conference effective in 2024–25.

Additionally they vote to award the 5 individual trophies to an eligible player at the same time. The Big Ten also awards a Tournament Most Outstanding Player which is voted on after the conclusion of the conference tournament. Each team also names one of their players to be honored for the conference Sportsmanship Award. All of the awards were created for the inaugural season (2013–14).




==Men&#x27;s lacrosse==
The Big Ten began sponsoring men&#x27;s lacrosse in the 2015 season. The Big Ten lacrosse league includes Maryland, Michigan, Ohio State, Penn State, Rutgers, and Johns Hopkins, which joined the Big Ten conference as an affiliate member in 2014. The teams that compete in Big Ten men&#x27;s lacrosse have combined to win 13 NCAA national championships.

With the addition of Johns Hopkins and Maryland to the league, Big Ten men&#x27;s lacrosse boasts two of the top programs and most heated rivals in the history of the sport. Johns Hopkins (29) and Maryland (29) combine for 58 NCAA men&#x27;s lacrosse Final Four appearances. The media and both schools have called Johns Hopkins–Maryland rivalry the greatest and most historic rivalry in men&#x27;s lacrosse. Since 1895, the two teams have matched up more than 100 times.

<text>A client state in the context of international relations is a state that is economically, politically, and militarily subordinated to a more powerful controlling state. Alternative terms for a &quot;client state&quot; are satellite state, associated state, and dominion, condominium, self-governing colony, and neo-colony, protectorate, vassal state, puppet state, and tributary state.

==Controlling states in history==
===Persia, Greece, Ancient China and Rome===

Ancient states such as Persia, Parthia, Greek city-states, Ancient China, and Ancient Rome sometimes created client states by making the leaders of that state subservient, having to provide tribute and soldiers. Classical Athens, for example, forced weaker states into the Delian League and in some cases imposed democratic governments on them. Later, Philip II of Macedon similarly imposed the League of Corinth. One of the most prolific users of client states was Republican Rome which, instead of conquering and then absorbing into an empire, chose to make client states out of those it defeated (e.g. Demetrius of Pharos), a policy which was continued up until the 1st century BCE when it became the Roman Empire. Sometimes the client was not a former enemy but a pretender whom Rome helped, Herod the Great being a well-known example. The use of client states continued through the Middle Ages as the feudal system began to take hold.

===Ottoman Empire===
The number of tributary or vassal states varied over time but most notable were the Khanate of Crimea, Wallachia, Moldavia, Transylvania, the Sharifate of Mecca, and the Sultanate of Aceh.

==19th and 20th centuries==
===Russian Empire===

Austria-Hungary tried to make Serbia a client state in order to form a Christian opposition to the Ottoman Empire, but after the 1903 May Coup, Serbia came under the influence of Russia, which was forming a pan-Eastern Orthodox opposition to the Latin Christianity represented by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1914, Russia repeatedly warned Austria-Hungary against attacking Serbia. When it did attack, Russia mobilised its army. Russia also wanted Bulgaria and Montenegro as client states.

At the time, Great Britain and Austria-Hungary both considered Serbia as a client state controlled by Russia.

===First French Empire===
During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras (1789–1815), France conquered most of western Europe and established several client states.

At first, during the French Revolutionary Wars, these states were erected as &quot;Républiques soeurs&quot; (&quot;sister republics&quot;). They were established in Italy (the Cisalpine Republic in Northern Italy and the Parthenopean Republic in Southern Italy), Greece (&quot;Îles Ioniennes&quot;), Switzerland (the Helvetic Republic and the Rhodanic Republic), and Belgium and the Netherlands (Batavian Republic).

During the First French Empire, while Napoleon I and the French Army occupied much of Europe, such states changed, and several new states were formed. The Italian republics were transformed into the Kingdom of Italy under Napoleon&#x27;s direct rule in the north, and the Kingdom of Naples in the south, first under Joseph Bonaparte and later under Marshal Joachim Murat. A third state was created in the Italian Peninsula, the Kingdom of Etruria. The Batavian Republic was replaced by the Kingdom of Holland, ruled by Napoleon&#x27;s third brother, Louis Bonaparte.

A total of 35 German states, all of them allies of France, seceded from the Holy Roman Empire to create the Confederation of the Rhine, a client state created to provide a buffer between France and its two largest enemies to the east, Prussia and Austria. Two of those states were Napoleonic creations: the Kingdom of Westphalia, which was controlled by Jérôme Bonaparte, the Emperor&#x27;s youngest brother; and the Grand Duchy of Würzburg as was Poland, then the Duchy of Warsaw.

During the French invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, Napoleon attempted to subjugate Portugal and Spain into a client Kingdom of Spain, but the French were eventually driven out of Iberia in a costly war.

===France after decolonisation===
In the 20th century, France exercised a sphere of influence, or &quot;Françafrique&quot; over its former African colonies, and to some degree former Belgian colonies in Africa (which were also French-speaking). The term is sometimes used pejoratively, to characterise the relationship with France as neocolonial. The former colonies provide oil and minerals important to the French economy, and in some, French companies have commercial interests.

===British Empire===

The Indian princely states were nominally sovereign entities in the British Empire and in 1947, were given a choice to either accede to independent India or Pakistan or get independence (the Nizam of Hyderabad did opt for independence but his kingdom was annexed by Indian forces in 1948). Egyptian independence in 1922 ended its brief status as a British protectorate and Iraq was made a kingdom in 1932. But in both cases, the economic and military reality did not amount to full independence, but a status where the local rulers were British clients. Other instances include Africa (e.g. Northern Nigeria under Lord Lugard), and the Unfederated Malay States; the policy of &quot;indirect rule&quot;.

===Germany===
====World War I====

* Kingdom of Poland (1917–1918)
* Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)
* (1918)
* Duchy of Courland and Semigallia (1918)
* (1918)

====World War II====
* Slovak Republic (1939–1945)
* (1940–1944)
* (1941–1945)
* Albanian Kingdom (1943–1944)

===United States===

The term has also been applied to states which are extremely economically dependent on a more powerful nation. The three Pacific Ocean countries associated with the United States under the Compact of Free Association (the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau) have been called client states.

* (1945–1949) → (1949–1979)
* (1970–1975)
* (1965–1986)
* (1948–1953)
* (1954–1975)
* (1949–1976)

===Imperial Japan===

In the late 19th century, the Empire of Japan gradually reduced Joseon Korea&#x27;s status to that of a client state. In the early 20th century, this was converted to direct rule. Manchukuo, in contrast, remained a puppet state throughout World War II.

===Soviet Union===

Soviet proxy, &quot;satellite&quot;, or client states included much of the Warsaw Pact member states whose policies were heavily influenced by Soviet military power and economic aid. Other nations with Marxist–Leninist governments were routinely criticised as being Soviet proxies as well, among them Cuba following the Cuban Revolution, the Chinese Soviet Republic, North Korea, North Vietnam, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, South Yemen, the People&#x27;s Republic of Angola, the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Within the Soviet Union itself, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR, had seats at the United Nations, but were actually proper Soviet territory.
