<text>The International Geophysical Year (IGY; ), also referred to as the third International Polar Year, was an international scientific project that lasted from 1 July 1957 to 31 December 1958. It marked the end of a long period during the Cold War when scientific interchange between East and West had been seriously interrupted. Sixty-seven countries participated in IGY projects, although one notable exception was the mainland People&#x27;s Republic of China, which was protesting against the participation of the Republic of China (Taiwan). East and West agreed to nominate the Belgian Marcel Nicolet as secretary general of the associated international organization.

The IGY encompassed fourteen Earth science disciplines: aurora, airglow, cosmic rays, geomagnetism, gravity, ionospheric physics, longitude and latitude determinations (precision mapping), meteorology, oceanography, nuclear radiation, glaciology, seismology, rockets and satellites, and solar activity. The timing of the IGY was particularly suited for studying some of these phenomena, since it covered the peak of solar cycle 19.

Both the Soviet Union and the U.S. launched artificial satellites for this event; the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Sputnik 1&quot;, launched on October 4, 1957, was the first successful artificial satellite. Other significant achievements of the IGY included the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts by Explorer 1 and mid-ocean submarine ridges, an important confirmation of plate-tectonic theory. Also, many international bases were established in Antarctica, many of which have been maintained to the present day, including at the south pole.

==History==
The origin of the International Geophysical Year can be traced to the International Polar Years held in 1882–1883, then in 1932–1933 and most recently from March 2007 to March 2009. On 5 April 1950, multiple scientists (including Lloyd Berkner, Sydney Chapman, S. Fred Singer, and Harry Vestine) met in James Van Allen&#x27;s living room and suggested that the time was ripe to have a worldwide Geophysical Year instead of a Polar Year, especially considering recent advances in rocketry, radar, and computing. Berkner and Chapman proposed to the International Council of Scientific Unions that an International Geophysical Year (IGY) be planned for 1957–58, coinciding with an approaching period of maximum solar activity. In 1952, the IGY was announced. Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 opened the way for international collaboration with the Soviet Union.

In 1952 the Comité Speciale de l&#x27;Année Géophysique Internationale (CSAGI), a special committee of the ICSU, was established to coordinate the International Geophysical Year (IGY) under president Sydney Chapman, a British geophysicist.

==Events==
On 29 July 1955, James C. Hagerty, president Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s press secretary, announced that the United States intended to launch &quot;small Earth circling satellites&quot; between 1 July 1957 and 31 December 1958 as part of the United States contribution to the International Geophysical Year (IGY). Project Vanguard would be managed by the Naval Research Laboratory and to be based on developing sounding rockets, which had the advantage that they were primarily used for non-military scientific experiments.

Four days later, at the Sixth Congress of International Astronautical Federation in Copenhagen, scientist Leonid I. Sedov spoke to international reporters at the Soviet embassy and announced his country&#x27;s intention to launch a satellite in the &quot;near future&quot;.

To the surprise of many, the USSR launched Sputnik 1 as the first artificial Earth satellite on 4 October 1957. After several failed Vanguard launches, Wernher von Braun and his team convinced President Dwight D. Eisenhower to use one of their US Army missiles for the Explorer program (there was not yet an inhibition about using military rockets to get into space). On 8 November 1957, the US Secretary of Defense instructed the US Army to use a modified Jupiter-C rocket to launch a satellite. The US achieved this goal only four months later with Explorer 1, on 1 February 1958, but after Sputnik 2 on 3 November 1957, making Explorer 1 the third artificial Earth satellite. Vanguard 1 became the fourth, launched on 17 March 1958. The Soviet launches would be followed by considerable political consequences, one of which was the creation of the US space agency NASA on 29 July 1958.

The British–American survey of the Atlantic, carried out between September 1954 and July 1959, discovered the full length of the mid-Atlantic ridges (plate tectonics); it was a major discovery during the IGY.

==World Data Centers==
Although the 1932 Polar Year accomplished many of its goals, it fell short on others because of the advance of World War II. In fact, because of the war, much of the data collected and scientific analyses completed during the 1932 Polar Year were lost forever, something that was particularly troubling to the IGY organizing committee. The committee resolved that &quot;all observational data shall be available to scientists and scientific institutions in all countries.&quot; They felt that without the free exchange of data across international borders, there would be no point in having an IGY.

In April 1957, just three months before the IGY began, scientists representing the various disciplines of the IGY established the World Data Center system. The United States hosted World Data Center &quot;A&quot; and the Soviet Union hosted World Data Center &quot;B&quot;. World Data Center &quot;C&quot; was subdivided among countries in Western Europe, Australia, and Japan. NOAA hosted seven of the fifteen World Data Centers in the United States.

Each World Data Center would eventually archive a complete set of IGY data to deter losses prevalent during the International Polar Year of 1932. Each World Data Center was equipped to handle many different data formats, including computer punch cards and tape—the original computer media. In addition, each host country agreed to abide by the organizing committee&#x27;s resolution that there should be a free and open exchange of data among nations. ICSU-WDS goals are to preserve quality-assured scientific data and information, to facilitate open access, and promote the adoption of standards. ICSU World Data System created in 2008 superseded the World Data Centers (WDCs) and Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical data analysis Services (FAGS) created by ICSU to manage data generated by the International Geophysical Year.

==Antarctica==
The IGY triggered an 18-month year of Antarctic science. The International Council of Scientific Unions, a parent body, broadened the proposals from polar studies to geophysical research. More than 70 existing national scientific organizations then formed IGY committees, and participated in the cooperative effort.

Australia established its first permanent base on the Antarctic continent at Mawson in 1954. It is now the longest continuously operating station south of the Antarctic Circle. Davis was added in 1957, in the Vestfold Hills, 400 miles (640 km) east of Mawson. The wintering parties for the IGY numbered 29 at Mawson and 4 at Davis, all male. (Both stations now have 16 to 18 winterers, including both sexes.) As a part of the IGY activities, a two-man camp was installed beside Taylor Glacier, 60 miles (97 km) west of Mawson. Its principal purpose was to enable parallactic photography of the aurora australis (thus locating it in space), but it also permitted studies of Emperor penguins in the adjacent rookery.

Two years later, Australia took over the running of Wilkes, a station built for the IGY by the United States. When Wilkes rapidly deteriorated from snow and ice accumulation, plans were made to build Casey Station, known as Repstat (&quot;replacement station&quot;). Opened in 1969, Repstat was replaced by present-day Casey station in 1988.

Halley Research Station was founded in 1956 for the IGY by an expedition from the (British) Royal Society. The bay where the expedition set up their base was named Halley Bay, after the astronomer Edmond Halley.

Showa Station, the first Japanese base in Antarctica, was set up in January 1957, supported by the ice breaker &quot;Sōya&quot;. When the ship returned a year later, it became beset offshore (stuck in the sea-ice). It was eventually freed with the assistance of the US icebreaker &quot;Burton Island&quot; but could not resupply the station. The 1957 winterers were retrieved by helicopter, but bad weather prevented going back for the station&#x27;s 15 sled dogs, which were left chained up. When the ship returned a year later, two of the dogs, Taro and Jiro, were still alive. They had escaped the dogline and survived by killing Adélie penguins in a nearby rookery (which were preserved by the low temperature). The two dogs became instant national heroes in Japan. A Japanese movie about this story was made in 1983, &quot;Antarctica&quot;.

France contributed Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station and Charcot Station in Adélie Land. As a forerunner expedition, the ship &quot;Commandant Charcot&quot; of the French Navy spent nine months of 1949/50 at the coast of Adelie Land. The first French station, Port Martin, was completed 9 April 1950, but destroyed by fire the night of 22 to 23 January 1952.

Belgium established the King Baudouin Base in 1958. The expedition was led by Gaston de Gerlache, son of Adrien de Gerlache who had led the 1897–1899 Belgian Antarctic Expedition. In December 1958, four team members were stranded several hundred kilometers inland when one of the skis on their light aircraft broke on landing. After a ten-day ordeal, they were rescued by an IL-14 aircraft after a flight of 1,940 miles (3,100 km) from the Soviet base, Mirny Station.

The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station was erected as the first permanent structure at the South Pole in January 1957. It survived intact for 53 years, but was slowly buried in the ice (as all structures there eventually sink into the icy crust), until it was demolished in December 2010 for safety reasons.

==Arctic==
Ice Skate 2 was a floating research station constructed and staffed by U.S. scientists. It mapped the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. Zeke Langdon was a meteorologist on the project. Ice Skate 2 was planned to be staffed in 6 month shifts, but due to soft ice surfaces for landing some crew members were stationed for much longer. At one point they lost all communications with anyone over their radios for one month except the expedition on the North Pole. At another point the ice sheet broke up and their fuel tanks started floating away from the base. They had to put pans under the plane engines as soon as they landed as any oil spots would go straight through the ice in the intense sunshine. Their only casualty was a man who got too close to the propeller with the oil pan.

Norbert Untersteiner was the project leader for Drifting Station Alpha and in 2008 produced and narrated a documentary about the project for the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

==Legacy==

In the end, the IGY was a resounding success, and it led to advancements that live on today. For example, the work of the IGY led directly to the Antarctic Treaty, which called for the use of Antarctica for peaceful purposes and cooperative scientific research. Since then, international cooperation has led to protecting the Antarctic environment, preserving historic sites, and conserving the animals and plants. Today, 41 nations have signed the Treaty and international collaborative research continues.

The ICSU World Data System (WDS) was created by the 29th General Assembly of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and builds on the 50-year legacy of the former ICSU World Data Centres (WDCs) and former Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical data-analysis Services (FAGS).

This World Data System, hosts the repositories for data collected during the IGY.
Seven of the 15 World Data Centers in the United States are co-located at NOAA National Data Centers or at NOAA affiliates. 
These ICSU Data Centers not only preserve historical data, but also promote research and ongoing data collection.

The fourth International Polar Year on 2007–2008 focused on climate change and its effects on the polar environment. Sixty countries participated in this effort and it included studies in the Arctic and Antarctic.

==In popular culture==

*&quot;I.G.Y. (What a Beautiful World)&quot; is a track on Donald Fagen&#x27;s 1982 album, &quot;The Nightfly.&quot; The song is sung from an optimistic viewpoint during the IGY, and features references to then-futuristic concepts, such as solar power (first used in 1958), Spandex (invented in 1959), space travel for entertainment, and an undersea international high-speed rail. The song peaked at #26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 27 November – 11 December 1982 and was nominated for a Grammy Award for song of the year.
*The IGY is featured prominently in a 1957–1958 run of &quot;Pogo&quot; comic strips by Walt Kelly. The characters in the strip refer to the scientific initiative as the &quot;G.O. Fizzickle Year&quot;. During this run, the characters try to make their own contributions to scientific endeavours, such as putting a flea on the moon. Compilations of the strips were published by &quot;Simon &amp; Schuster SC&quot; in 1958 as &quot;G.O. Fizzickle Pogo&quot; and later &quot;Pogo&#x27;s Will Be That Was&quot; in 1979. The run was also included in &quot; Vol. 5: Out of This World at Home&quot; published by &quot;Fantagraphics&quot; in 2018.
*Jazz saxophonist and composer Gil Mellé recorded a &quot;Dedicatory Piece to the Geo-Physical Year of 1957&quot; for his album &quot;Primitive Modern&quot;, released by Prestige Records.
*The IGY was featured in a cartoon by Russell Brockbank in &quot;Punch&quot; in November 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;punch/Brockbank-Cartoons&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the three main superpowers UK, USA and USSR at the South Pole, each with a gathering of penguins which they are trying to educate with &quot;culture&quot;. The penguins in the British camp are being bored with Francis Bacon; in the American camp they are happily playing baseball, while the Russian camp resembles a gulag, with barbed-wire fences and the penguins are made to march and perform military maneuvers.
*The Alistair MacLean novel &quot;Night Without End&quot; takes place in and around an IGY research station in Greenland.
*The IGY features in two episodes of the 1960–61 season of the documentary television series &quot;Expedition!&quot;: &quot;The Frozen Continent&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;s First Winter at the South Pole&quot;.

<doc id="78175" wikidata="Q3327708" url="?curid=78175" title="Fruit tree propagation">
<text>[[Fruit tree]] propagation is usually carried out vegetatively (non-sexually) by grafting or budding a desired variety onto a suitable rootstock.

Perennial plants can be propagated either by sexual or vegetative means. Sexual reproduction begins when a male germ cell (pollen) from one flower fertilises a female germ cell (ovule, incipient seed) of the same species, initiating the development of a fruit containing seeds. Each seed, when germinated, can grow to become a new specimen tree. However, the new tree inherits characteristics of both its parents, and it will not grow true to the variety of either parent from which it came. That is, it will be a fresh individual with an unpredictable combination of characteristics of its own. Although this is desirable in terms of producing novel combinations from the richness of the gene pool of the two parent plants (such sexual recombination is the source of new cultivars), only rarely will the resulting new fruit tree be directly useful or attractive to the tastes of humankind. Most new plants will have characteristics that lie somewhere between those of the two parents.

Therefore, from the orchard grower or gardener&#x27;s point of view, it is preferable to propagate fruit cultivars vegetatively in order to ensure reliability. This involves taking a cutting (or scion) of wood from a desirable parent tree which is then grown on to produce a new plant or &quot;clone&quot; of the original. In effect this means that the original Bramley apple tree, for example, was a successful variety grown from a pip, but that every Bramley since then has been propagated by taking cuttings of living matter from that tree, or one of its descendants.

==Methods==
The simplest method of propagating a tree vegetatively is rooting or taking cuttings. A cutting (usually a piece of stem of the parent plant) is cut off and stuck into soil. Artificial rooting hormones are sometimes used to improve chances of success. If the cutting does not die from rot-inducing fungi or desiccation first, roots grow from the buried portion of the cutting to become a new complete plant. However, although this works well for some plants (such as figs and olives), for most fruit tree cultivars this method has much too low a success rate to be commercially viable. Root cuttings (pieces of root cut off and induced to grow a new trunk) are also not used to propagate fruit trees, although this method is successful with some herbaceous plants.

A refinement on rooting is layering. This is rooting a piece of a wood that is still attached to its parent and continues to receive nourishment from it. The new plant is severed only after it has successfully grown roots. Layering is the technique most used for propagation of clonal apple rootstocks.

The most common method of propagating fruit trees, suitable for nearly all species, is grafting onto rootstocks. This in essence involves physically joining part of a shoot of a hybrid cultivar onto the roots of a different but closely related species or cultivar, so that the two parts grow together as one plant. The process of joining the two varieties must ensure maximum contact between the cambium (the layer just below the bark) of each, so that they grow together successfully. Grafting is a preferred method because it not only propagates a new plant of the desired hybrid cultivar, it usually also confers extra advantages as a result of the characteristics of the rootstocks (or stocks), which are selected for characteristics such as their vigour of growth, hardiness and soil tolerance, as well as compatibility with the desired variety that will form the aerial part of the plant (called the scion). For example, grape rootstocks descended from North American grapes allow European grapes to be grown in areas infested with &quot;Phylloxera&quot;, a soil-dwelling insect that attacks and kills European grapes when grown on their own roots. Two of the most common grafting techniques are &quot;whip and tongue&quot;, carried out in spring as the sap rises, and &quot;budding&quot;, which is performed around the end of summer.

===Bud grafting===
# Cut a slice of bud and bark from the parent tree.
# Cut a similar sliver off the rootstock, making a little lip at the base to slot the scion into.
# Join the two together and bind.
# In time, the scion bud will grow into a shoot, which will develop into the desired tree.

===Whip and tongue grafting===

# Make a sloping cut in the rootstock with a &quot;tongue&quot; pointing upwards.
# Make a matching cut in the scion wood with a &quot;tongue&quot; pointing downwards.
# Join the two, ensuring maximum contact of the vascular cambium layers. Bind with raffia or polythene tape or wind around with a 5mm wide strip of elastic band (this is particularly successful because it keeps pressure on the cambium layers to be joined and eventually falls away without cutting into the bark as the tree grows) and seal with grafting wax.

==Rootstocks==
One reason for grafting onto rootstocks is that this enables the grower to determine the tree&#x27;s eventual size.

Another desirable characteristic of rootstocks is environmental adaptability. This may be tolerance to wet/dry soil conditions, acidity/alkalinity of soil or even hot/cold air temperature.

===Apple rootstocks===
Apple tree size classes number from one to ten in increasing height and breadth. A &quot;1&quot; is a dwarf which can be productive and as short as with proper pruning. A &quot;10&quot; is the standard sized tree with no dwarfing and will grow to tall and wide or more, dependent upon the variety chosen. In general the class range is (1) 10-20% of full size, (2) 20-30%, (3) 30-40% and so forth to size 10 which is 100% of full size.

The Malling series and clones have been standard rootstocks for apples for many years and remain the &quot;workhorses&quot; for the commercial industry in the United States and the UK. However, since most of them are susceptible to disease some Malling rootstocks are being replaced by new breeds, including the Cornell-Geneva series, which has resistance to the major problems preventing quality production of apples utilizing organic control systems. One of the newest rootstocks of the &quot;CG&quot; series, only released commercially in 2004, is CG5202(G.202) which adds resistance to the woolly apple aphid, and when combined with highly resistant cultivars such as &quot;Liberty&quot; it is showing great potential. Rootstocks based on Siberian Crab apple are being used in colder areas for more cold tolerance.

The ability of new rootstocks to modify or augment characteristics of fruit trees is limited and may disappoint in the long term. It takes ten years to get a full picture of the effects of any one rootstock, so a rootstock that appears promising in the first five years of a trial may fail in the last five years. The Mark rootstock was such a stock and has now fallen mostly into disfavor. Another, the G.30, has proved to be an excellent stock for production but it was only after a number of years of trials that it was found to be somewhat incompatible with the cultivar &quot;Gala&quot;, so that it is now recommended to be staked and wired.

An industry consortium undertakes trials of different rootstocks, called the &quot;NC-140&quot; trials. These test many pome rootstocks in many different sites across the United States and thereby provide growers a clearer picture of what to expect when growing fruit trees on specific stock, in specific planting methods in their specific area of the country. This information has the potential to create economic benefits to both growers and consumers, as well as helping to reduce the need to spray pesticides as frequently as is currently required.

The following are a selection of apple tree rootstocks. They are referred to by numbers prefixed by letters indicating the developer of the rootstock.

&quot;Bud 118&quot; A winter hardy early bearing replacement for MM111 bred in the Soviet Union. Full sized tree unless allowed to bear young which will stunt its growth. Hardy to USDA zone 3.

&quot;Bud 9&quot; A winter hardy, early bearing replacement for M9 bred in the Soviet Union. Dwarf tree resistant to crown rot and less susceptible to drought than most other dwarfing stocks. Produces large fruit, is precocious and hardy to USDA zone 3.

&quot;M&quot; designates Malling series developed stocks. East Malling Research is a pioneer in the development of dwarfing rootstocks. East Malling Research Station in Kent, England collected clones of the Paradise stocks from France in 1912 from which 24 &quot;M&quot; were designated with no particular order to the rootstock characteristics other than where they were located in the garden at the time the numbers were assigned. In other words, M.2 is a larger tree than M.9, while M.27 is smaller than M.26.

* M.2: Produces a semidwarf to semistandard freestanding tree, depending on scion variety. Trees are strong, crop well, and do not have collar rot problems.
* M.7: Produces a semidwarf tree of Class 6 that is freestanding in deep well drained soils but in rocky, steep, or shallow soils, it tends to lean. The rootstock may sucker profusely and is susceptible to collar rot (Phytophthora).
* M.9: Very dwarfing — Reaches a height of , coming into fruit after 3 to 4 years, reaching full capacity of after 5 to 6 years. It will grow under average soil conditions, but needs a good rich soil to thrive. A good choice where space is limited and fertility is high. Permanent staking is required, as is routine feeding and watering. Trees on this rootstock always require leader support. The rootstock is very susceptible to fire blight and can develop burr knots.
* M.25: Very vigorous — Suitable for a grassed orchard, and to grow on as a full standard. Plant apart, makes a tree of or more height and spread, eventually yielding per tree. This rootstock is primarily used in UK and is rarely seen in the United States where MM.111(size Class 8) is used for this size tree.
* M.26: Dwarfing — Similar to M9 in effect, although somewhat more vigorous and generally stronger, with a higher expected eventual yield of and height of . A good choice where soil quality is average and compact growth is required. Comes into fruit after 3 to 4 years, reaching full cropping capacity after 5 to 6 years. Staking is needed for the first four or five years of its life. It is susceptible to collar rot and fire blight and should not be planted in a wet site. Certain varieties when grafted onto this rootstock may exhibit signs of graft union incompatibility, i.e., the union breaks.
* M.27: A very dwarfing rootstock. Unless the central leader is supported, the tree will be very small. Often only used as an intermediate stem piece on MM.106 or MM.111. If handled and spaced properly, it can be a very productive stock for a vertical axe system. Trees can be grown three to four feet tall and produce about 45 fruit, roughly 2 pecks, depending on fruit cultivar.

&quot;MM&quot; designates Malling-Merton stocks developed from joint breeding program by John Innes Institute, in Merton, England, &amp; East Malling Research Station in the early 1950s. The &quot;MM&quot; series was developed primarily to provide resistance to Woolly Apple Aphid (Eriosomatinae) infestation.
* MM.106: Semi-dwarfing — Sometimes referred to as semi-vigorous, this is the most widely used of rootstocks. It is probably the best choice for the average garden under average conditions, being tolerant of a wide range of soils, and producing a tree with an eventual size of . Trees on this stock begin producing fruit within three to four years, and yield after some seven or eight years. MM106 is very suitable for use with weaker varieties that would produce undersized bushes with more dwarfing rootstocks. Can be trained as a half standard tree, but is rather too vigorous for cordons unless the soil is poor. Requires staking for the first four or five years or so of its life. Trees on MM.106 are highly susceptible to collar rot especially when planted in soils that remain wet (poor percolation).
* MM.111: Vigorous — Not generally suitable for garden scale growing, being both too large and spreading (18–25 ft), and too slow to come into cropping. They are, however, suitable for growing as specimen standards in the large garden, or for producing medium-sized bushes on poorer soils. Begins to fruit after six or seven years, reaching full capacity of after seven to eight years. It is not winter hardy in United States zone 3 unless it receives abundant snow cover. Bud 118 was developed in the Soviet Union to replace MM.111, Bud 118 is winter hardy in zone 3 and very precocious. (Early bearing). Planting depth of this rootstock is critical. The union should be no higher than 1 to 2 inches above the final soil line.

&quot;EMLA&quot; designates East Malling / Long Ashton research stations who took the &quot;M&quot; stocks and developed virus free versions. For example., EMLA 7 is M 7 with a guaranteed virus-free stock. EMLA characteristics are often different from the parent &quot;M&quot; rootstock. Note that nearly all the apple rootstocks in the industry are now virus free.

&quot;CG&quot; or &quot;G&quot; designates Cornell-Geneva stocks which are those developed via the Cornell and USDA collaboration at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY. The &quot;G&quot; is the old designation. All newer stocks are &quot;CG&quot; followed by numbers that actually provide some information about the stock. As one might surmise, this is a huge improvement in the classical naming scheme which has no identification method at all.
* G.11 Geneva 11 is the second release of the Cornell breeding program similar in size to M.26 (Class 4), but more productive. Has the advantage of being resistant to fire blight and crown rot as well as only rarely producing suckers or burr knots.
* G.41 Geneva 41, released in 2005, produces trees the size of M.9. The rootstock was developed from a cross between M.27 and Robusta 5 made in 1975. Resistant to Crown|Collar|Root rot (Phytophthora) and fire blight.
* G.202 Geneva 202(CG 4202) is a semidwarfing rootstock that produces a tree in class 5 slightly larger than M.26(Size Class 4) and is more productive than M.26. It was developed from a cross of M.27 (Size Class 1) and Robusta 5 to be fire blight and Phytophthora resistant as well as having resistance to woolly apple aphids. In a 9-year study with the scion cultivar of the &quot;Liberty&quot; apple, G.202 was about 50 percent smaller than M.7, but had much greater production efficiency.

&quot;P&quot; designates Poland. The Polish apple rootstocks were designed specifically for winter hardiness.

&quot;A2&quot;: Developed in Sweden for hardiness and strength.

Seedling: Very vigorous trees produced on a rootstock grown from seed. There is greater variability than with the vegetatively propagated rootstocks. Apples used for production of seedling rootstocks include &quot;Dolgo&quot; and &quot;Antonovka&quot;, which are both extremely hardy and vigorous.

===Pear rootstocks===
Pears are usually grafted onto quince rootstocks, which produce small to medium-sized trees. Some varieties, however, are not compatible with quince, and these require double working. This means that a piece of pear graft-work compatible with both the quince rootstock and the pear variety is used as an intermediate between the two. If this is not done the pear and the rootstock could eventually separate at the graft. Varieties that require double working include &quot;Bristol Cross&quot;, &quot;Dr Jules Guyot&quot;, &quot;Doyenné d&#x27; été&quot; and &quot;Williams Bon Chrétien&quot;.

* Quince C: Moderately vigorous — Makes a bush pear tree about tall, bearing fruit within four to seven years. Suitable for highly fertile soils and vigorous varieties, but not where conditions are poor. Used for bush, cordon and espalier growing. Old stocks of Quince C may be infected with a virus, so care should be taken to obtain certified virus free stock. If in doubt, use Quince A as there is not a great amount of difference in vigor between the two.
* Quince A: Medium vigor — Slightly more vigorous than Quince C, this is the most common variety upon which pears are grafted. Bears fruit between four and eight years, making a tree of some in height and spread. Suitable for all forms of pear trees except standards.
* Pear stock: Very vigorous — Pears grafted onto pear rootstocks make very large trees, not suitable for most gardens.

===Cherry rootstocks===
Until the 1970s, cherries were grown on the vigorous &quot;Malling F12/1&quot;, &quot;Mazzard&quot; (&quot;Prunus avium&quot;), or &quot;Maheleb&quot; (&quot;P. maheleb&quot;) rootstocks, which required much space and time before cropping began, thus the growing of cherries was not a realistic option on a garden scale. The introduction of the rootstock &quot;Colt&quot; enabled trees reaching a maximum height of to be grown, and if trained as a pyramid it is possible to restrict growth to about . The popular sweet variety &quot;Stella&quot; can even be successfully grown in a pot on the patio when grafted onto a &quot;Colt&quot; rootstock. A newer rootstock, &quot;Gisela 5&quot;, is slowly becoming available to gardeners and produces a tree 20% smaller than &quot;Colt&quot; and 45% smaller than &quot;Mahaleb&quot; and &quot;Mazzard&quot;, making netting for bird protection much easier. Furthermore, German Nurseries Consortium (Consortium Deutscher Baumschulen — CDB®) is introducing across the EU their newest most dwarfing &quot;Gisela 3&quot; cherry rootstock that has 50% dwarfing qualities in comparison with &quot;Mahaleb&quot; and &quot;Mazzard&quot; and is 10% smaller still than &quot;Gisela 5&quot; rootstock.

===Plum rootstocks===
Plum rootstocks are often suitable for peaches, nectarines and apricots. They include:
* Pixy — A dwarfing rootstock (&quot;Prunus domestica&quot; subsp. &quot;insititia&quot;, or sometimes &quot;Prunus insititia&quot;) suitable for bush trees planted apart.
* St. Julien A — A semi-vigorous rootstock suitable for bush and half standards planted apart. Also suitable for peaches, nectarines and apricots.
* Brompton or Myrobalan B- (Prunus cerasifera) — Suitable for half standards planted apart. Also suitable for peaches, nectarines and apricots.
* Myro-29C — (Prunus cerasifera) Semi-dwarf rootstock. Shallow, vigorous, good choice for hard soils. Somewhat drought tolerant.
* Citation — Semi-dwarf rootstock. Shallow, vigorous, good choice for hard soils. Prefers a wetter soil.

==Own-root fruit trees==
Many species of fruit, e.g., fig, olive, and pomegranate, are commonly grown on their own roots, as there may be no great advantages to using a special rootstock, or suitable rootstocks may not be readily available. However, even for fruit trees that usually are grown grafted on a rootstock, there can be advantages in growing them on their own roots instead, particularly in the traditional coppicing systems advocated in both sustainable agriculture and permaculture. Disadvantages of using own-root trees can include excessive size and excessive production of wood (thus very long times until the start of fruit production), although training branches horizontally and limiting pruning to summer only may help encourage fruit production at an earlier age. There is a lack of research on the use of the own root method in large-scale systems. British horticulturalist Hugh Ermen was a prominent advocate of own root fruit trees, particularly apple trees, following his work at the Brogdale research centre in Kent. The research undertaken at Brogdale did not continue but there has been renewed academic interest in own root fruit trees since the turn of the century.

==Family trees and fruit salad trees==
In addition to propagating trees on rootstocks designed to control size/vigour and confer disease resistance, grafting above the rootstock can be used to provide multiple cultivars of a single species, known as a family tree, or, within certain limits, cultivars of different fruit species on one tree, often known as a fruit salad tree. Family trees typically combine several cultivars (two or three being most common) of apple, pear or a given species of stonefruit on a single rootstock, while fruit salad trees typically carry two or more different species from within a given genus, such as plum, apricot, and peach or mandarin orange, lemon, and lime. Certain combinations, including sour cherry (&quot;prunus cerasus&quot;)/sweet cherry (&quot;prunus avium&quot;), although from the same genus, are known to be difficult, although successes have sometimes been reported. Other grafts of this kind can produce the Pomato.

<doc id="78186" wikidata="Q180901" url="?curid=78186" title="Atomium">
<text>The Atomium ( , , ) is a landmark modernist building in Brussels, Belgium, originally constructed as the centrepiece of the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (Expo 58). Designed by the engineer André Waterkeyn and the architects André and Jean Polak as a tribute to scientific progress, as well as to symbolise Belgian engineering skills at the time, it is located on the Heysel/Heizel Plateau in Laeken (northern part of the City of Brussels), where the exhibition took place. It is the city&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction, and serves as a museum, an art centre and a cultural destination.

The Atomium stands tall, making it one of the tallest structures in Belgium. Its nine stainless steel clad spheres are connected in the shape of a unit cell that could represent an iron crystal magnified 165 billion times. Steel tubes connecting the spheres enclose stairs, escalators and an lift (in the central, vertical tube) to allow access to the six visitable spheres, which contain exhibit halls and other public spaces. The top sphere includes a restaurant with a panoramic view of Brussels. The building was completely renovated between 2004 and 2006 by the companies Jacques Delens and BESIX.

The building is located on the /, at the intersection of the / with the / and the /, and opposite the Centenary Palace of the Brussels Exhibition Centre (Brussels Expo). It is served by Heysel/Heizel metro station on line 6 of the Brussels Metro.

==Naming==
The name &quot;Atomium&quot; (pronounced ) is a portmanteau combining the words atom and aluminium, the metal with which the spheres were initially covered. The Brussels-Capital Region is bilingual; hence, both the monument&#x27;s French and Dutch names— and —are official. In French, (pronounced ) is used both in the masculine and in the feminine, even if the monument&#x27;s official team prefers the feminine. In Dutch, (pronounced ) is neuter. In English, it is usually referred to with the definite article &#x27;the&#x27; in front: &quot;the Atomium&quot;.

==History==

===Inception and construction===
The Atomium was built as the main pavilion and icon of the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair (Expo 58). In the 1950s, faith in scientific progress was great, and a structure depicting atoms was chosen to highlight humanity&#x27;s advance in science, including nuclear physics, which Belgium itself was an avid practitioner ever since the Belgian Congo&#x27;s uranium became the dominant source of material used for nuclear fission, including that used for the world&#x27;s first nuclear weapons. With the Atomium, Belgium wanted to highlight and promote the post-war ideal to peacefully apply atomic research and other advancements in technology in order to improve lives and serve the betterment of mankind. The Atomium&#x27;s nine stainless steel clad spheres depict nine iron atoms in the shape of the body-centred cubic unit cell that could for example represent α-iron (ferrite) crystal, magnified 165 billion times.

The construction of the Atomium was a technical feat. In January 1955, a first project was presented by the engineer André Waterkeyn, director of the economic department of , the Federation of Companies in the Metal Fabricating Industry (now known as Agoria). The architects André and Jean Polak were responsible for the architectural transposition of the concept, drawing up numerous sketches to do so. The company received assistance from consulting engineers Artémy S. Joukoff and André Beckers, assisted by the design office V. Daniel. The foundations were launched in March 1956 and the building, erected by the Jambes-Namur Construction Workshops, was completed less than a month before the inauguration of Expo 58, on 17 April 1958.

===Expo 58 and posterity===
Since opening, only six of the nine spheres are accessible to the public, the three of the central axis and the three lower outer ones, each with two main floors and a lower floor reserved for service. Tubes of diameter connect the spheres along the twelve edges of the cube and all eight vertices to the centre. The central tube contains the fastest lift in Europe of the time with a speed of , installed by the Belgian branch of the Swiss firm Schlieren (subsequently taken over by Schindler). It allows 22 people to reach the summit in 23 seconds. The escalators installed in the oblique tubes are also among the longest in Europe. The biggest is long.

The three upper outer spheres lack vertical support and hence are not open to the public for safety reasons (to minimise foot traffic in the sphere). The original design called for no leg supports on the three lower outer spheres; the structure was simply to rest on the singular mid-bottom sphere. However, wind tunnel tests proved that such a structure would have toppled in an wind, whilst up to winds have been recorded in Belgium. Support columns were thus added under the three spheres in question to achieve enough resistance against overturning.

The Atomium, designed to last six months, was not destined to survive the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair, but its popularity and success made it a major element of Brussels&#x27; landscape. Its destruction was therefore postponed year after year, until the city&#x27;s authorities decided to keep it. However, for thirty years, little maintenance work was done. Still, the building continued serving as the backdrop for major events and competitions. In 1960, the 47th Tour de France passed in front of it on its inaugural stages. From 1960 to 1962, the Brussels Motor Grand Prix automobile race was organised not far from it.

===Renovation (2004–2006)===
By the turn of the millennium, the state of the building had deteriorated and a comprehensive renovation was sorely needed. Renovation of the Atomium, carried by Belgian construction companies Jacques Delens and BESIX, began in March 2004; it was closed to the public in October of that year, and remained closed until 18 February 2006. The renovation included replacing the faded aluminium sheets on the spheres with stainless steel, as well as building a new reception pavilion with a boomerang-shaped roof. At the foot of the building, the roundabout was redeveloped into a concrete esplanade lined with continuous benches and a large step leading to the north-east.

On 21 December 2005, the Atomium&#x27;s new outdoor lighting was tested. The meridians of each sphere were covered with rectangular steel plates, in which LED lighting was integrated. The LED application illuminates the bulbs at night. The lights can also flash simultaneously or in turns at each meridian, symbolising the range of an electron around its core. In addition, the German industrial designer Ingo Maurer created lighting objects and installations for the interior of the building.

On 14 February 2006, the Atomium was officially reopened by then-Prince Philippe, and on 18 February 2006, it opened again to the public. The renovation cost €26 million. Brussels and the Atomium Association paid one-third of the costs, and the Belgian Government financed the other two thirds. To help finance the renovation, pieces of the old aluminium plates were sold to the public as souvenirs. One triangular piece about long sold for €1,000. In March 2006, a 2 euro commemorative coin depicting the building was issued to celebrate the renovation and reopening.

Though the Atomium depicts an iron unit cell, the spheres were originally clad with aluminium. Following the 2004–2006 renovation, however, the aluminium was replaced with stainless steel, which is primarily iron. Likewise, while the subject of Atomium was chosen to depict the enthusiasm of the Atomic Age, iron is not and cannot be used as fuel in nuclear reactions.

==Usage==
The Atomium, with over 600,000 visitors per year, is the most popular tourist attraction in Brussels, and acts as an international symbol of both the city and country. In addition to its heritage value, it is also a cultural place and an art centre. Over half of the building is dedicated to exhibitions with themes about Belgium and digital arts.

Of the six spheres accessible to the public: the bottom sphere is reserved for permanent exhibitions dedicated to the 1950s, Expo 58 and the building&#x27;s construction; the second sphere hosts temporary exhibitions; the third and central spheres have flexible spaces that can be rented for events, such as film showings, concerts, parties or conferences; the top sphere, in addition to the panorama, holds a restaurant; and the sixth sphere is the kids&#x27; sphere, intended for the organisation of workshops of urban pedagogy, allowing children from six to twelve years to spend the night there.

==Worldwide copyright claims==

SABAM, Belgium&#x27;s society for collecting copyrights, has claimed worldwide intellectual property rights on all reproductions of the image via the United States Artists Rights Society (ARS). For example, SABAM issued a demand that a United States website remove all images of the Atomium from its pages. The website responded by replacing all such images with a warning not to take photographs of the Atomium, and that A.S.B.L. Atomium will sue any individual or group if they show the photographs to anyone. SABAM confirmed that permission is required.

Ralf Ziegermann remarked on the complicated copyright instructions on the Atomium&#x27;s website specific to &quot;private pictures&quot;. The organisers of Belgian heritage, Anno Expo (planning the 50th anniversary celebrations of Expo 58), in the city of Mechelen announced a &quot;cultural guerrilla strike&quot; by asking people to send in their old photographs of the Atomium and requested 100 photoshoppers to paint over the balls. SABAM responded that they would make an exception for 2008 and that people could publish private photographs for one year only on condition they were for non-commercial purposes. Anno Expo later announced they had censored part of their own report due to &quot;complications&quot; and referred to a meeting they had with SABAM. Mechelen&#x27;s mayor, Bart Somers, called the Atomium copyright rules absurd.

From the Atomium&#x27;s website, the current copyright restrictions exempt private individuals under the following conditions:

In the summer of 2015, Belgian political party Open Vld, part of the then-ruling Michel I Government, proposed a bill to enable freedom of panorama in Belgium. The bill was enacted into law in June 2016, allowing pictures of the Atomium, and other public buildings under copyright, to be legally distributed.

<text>Karl Weyprecht, also spelt Carl Weyprecht, (8 September 1838 – 2 March 1881) was an Austro-Hungarian explorer. He was an officer (&quot;k.u.k. Linienschiffsleutnant&quot;) in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. He is most famous as an Arctic explorer, and an advocate of international cooperation for scientific polar exploration. Although he did not live to see it occur, he is associated with the organisation of the first International Polar Year.

In 1852, he studied at Gymnasium in Darmstadt, but later switched to Höhere Gewerbeschule Darmstadt, now the Technische Universität Darmstadt.

In 1856, he joined the Austro-Hungarian Navy (&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;) as a provisional sea cadet. He served in the Austro-Sardinian War. From 1860 to 1862, he served on the frigate &quot;Radetzky&quot; under the command of Admiral Tegetthoff. From 1863 to 1865, he was instructional officer on the training ship &quot;Hussar.&quot;

On 23 July 1865, he became known to the German geographer August Petermann at a meeting of the &quot;Geographic Society&quot; in Frankfurt.

He served in the 20 July 1866 sea battle at Lissa, aboard the ironclad .

He met Julius von Payer in 1870, and made a preliminary expedition with Payer to Novaya Zemlya in 1871.

On 18 February 1872, Weyprecht gained citizenship in Austria-Hungary.

He co-led, with Julius von Payer, the 1872-1874 Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition which discovered the archipelago Franz Josef Land in the Arctic Ocean. The expedition&#x27;s ship &quot;Admiral Tegetthoff&quot; was abandoned in the pack ice. The expedition then moved on sledges to go further north, then to open water, where they used boats to reach the Black Cape of Novaya Zemlya and would eventually contact a Russian schooner, &quot;Nikolaj&quot;, under Captain Feodor Voronin, and get to Vardø, Norway, where they took the mail boat south and eventually returned to Vienna. He was awarded the 1875 Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal.

On 18 September 1875, he addressed the 48th Meeting of German Scientists and Physicians in Graz, Austria. He reported the &quot;basic principles of Arctic research&quot; and suggested that fixed Arctic observation stations should be established. According to Weyprecht, it was important to organize a network of Arctic stations taking regular measurements of weather and ice conditions with identical devices and at preestablished intervals.

In 1879, he presented these ideas, along with George Neumayer&#x27;s to the 2nd International Congress of Meteorologists in Rome.

Karl Weyprecht died of tuberculosis in 1881.

== Commemorations ==
* The Austro-Hungarian polar expedition led by Weyprecht was selected as main motif for the Austrian Admiral Tegetthoff Ship and The Polar Expedition commemorative coin minted on 8 June 2005. The reverse side of the coin shows two explorers in Arctic gear with the frozen ship &quot;Admiral Tegetthoff&quot; behind them.
* Swedish musician Stina Nordenstam&#x27;s sound installation &quot;Isens Fasor&quot; was spoken directly from Karl Weyprecht&#x27;s expedition journal.
* Weyprecht Mountains, Cape Weyprecht, Weyprecht Fjord, Weyprecht Glacier, Weyprecht Islands
* The base camp near Erfoud, Morocco for the PolAres MARS2013 analog mission by the OeWF in February of that year was named &quot;Camp Weyprecht&quot; during the landing ceremony in the morning of 11 February 2013. (A smaller satellite location about 80 km further south was named &quot;Station Payer&quot;.)

<text>Nevil Shute Norway (17 January 189912 January 1960) was an English novelist and aeronautical engineer who spent his later years in Australia. He used his full name in his engineering career and Nevil Shute as his pen name to protect his engineering career from inferences by his employers (Vickers) or from fellow engineers that he was &quot;not a serious person&quot; or from potentially adverse publicity in connection with his novels, which included &quot;On the Beach&quot; and &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot;.

== Early life ==
Shute was born in Somerset Road, Ealing (which was then in Middlesex), in the house described in his novel &quot;Trustee from the Toolroom&quot;. He was educated at the Dragon School, Shrewsbury School and Balliol College, Oxford; he graduated from Oxford in 1922 with a third-class degree in engineering science.

Shute was the son of Arthur Hamilton Norway, who became head of the Post Office in Ireland before the First World War and was based at the General Post Office, Dublin in 1916 at the time of the Easter Rising, and his wife Mary Louisa Gadsden. Shute himself was later commended for his role as a stretcher-bearer during the rising. His grandmother Georgina Norway was a novelist.

Shute attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and trained as a gunner. He was unable to take up a commission in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, which he believed was because of his stammer. He served as a soldier in the Suffolk Regiment, enlisting in the ranks in August 1918. He guarded the Isle of Grain in the Thames Estuary, and served in military funeral parties in Kent during the 1918 flu pandemic.

== Career in aviation ==
An aeronautical engineer as well as a pilot, Shute began his engineering career with the de Havilland Aircraft Company. He used his pen-name as an author to protect his engineering career from any potentially adverse publicity in connection with his novels.

Dissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for advancement, he took a position in 1924 with Vickers Ltd., where he was involved with the development of airships, working as Chief Calculator (stress engineer) on the R100 airship project for the Vickers subsidiary Airship Guarantee Company. In 1929, he was promoted to deputy chief engineer of the R100 project under Barnes Wallis. When Wallis left the project, Shute became the chief engineer.

The R100 was a prototype for passenger-carrying airships that would serve the needs of Britain&#x27;s empire. The government-funded but privately developed R100 made a successful 1930 round trip to Canada. While in Canada it made trips from Montreal to Ottawa, Toronto, and Niagara Falls. The fatal 1930 crash near Beauvais, France, of its government-developed counterpart R101 ended British interest in dirigibles. The R100 was immediately grounded and subsequently scrapped.

Shute gives a detailed account of the development of the two airships in his 1954 autobiographical work, &quot;Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer&quot;. When he started, he wrote that he was shocked to find that before building the R38 the civil servants concerned &#x27;&quot;had made no attempt to calculate the aerodynamic forces acting on the ship&quot;&#x27; but had just copied the size of girders in German airships. The calculations for just one transverse frame of the R100 could take two or three months, and the solution &#x27;&quot;almost amounted to a religious experience.&quot; But later he wrote that &#x27;&quot;the disaster was the product of the system rather than the men at Cardington&quot;; the one thing that was proved is that &quot;government officials are totally ineffective in engineering development&quot; and any weapons (they develop) will be bad weapons. The R101 made one short test flight in perfect weather, and was given an airworthiness certificate for her flight to India to meet the minister’s deadline. Norway thought it probable that a new outer cover for the R101 was taped on with rubber adhesive which reacted with the dope. His account is very critical of the R101 design and management team, and strongly hints that senior team members were complicit in concealing flaws in the airship&#x27;s design and construction. In &quot;The Tender Ship,&quot; Manhattan Project engineer and Virginia Tech professor Arthur Squires used Shute&#x27;s account of the R100 and R101 as a primary illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.

In 1931, with the cancellation of the R100 project, Shute teamed up with the talented de Havilland-trained designer A. Hessell Tiltman to found the aircraft construction company Airspeed Ltd. A site was available in a former trolleybus garage on Piccadilly, York. Despite setbacks, including the usual problems of a new business, Airspeed Limited eventually gained recognition when its Envoy aircraft was chosen for the King&#x27;s Flight. With the approach of the Second World War, a military version of the Envoy was developed, to be called the Airspeed Oxford. The Oxford became the standard advanced multi-engined trainer for the RAF and British Commonwealth, with over 8,500 being built.

For the innovation of developing a hydraulic retractable undercarriage for the Airspeed Courier, and his work on R100, Shute was made a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.

On 7 March 1931, Shute married Frances Mary Heaton, a 28-year-old medical practitioner. They had two daughters, (Heather) Felicity and Shirley.

== Second World War==
By the outbreak of the Second World War, Shute was a rising novelist. Even as war seemed imminent he was working on military projects with his former boss at Vickers, Sir Dennistoun Burney. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) as a sub-lieutenant, having joined as an &quot;elderly yachtsman&quot; and expected to be in charge of a drifter or minesweeper, but after two days he was asked about his career and technical experience. He reached the &quot;dizzy rank&quot; of lieutenant commander, knowing nothing about &quot;Sunday Divisions&quot; and secretly fearing when he went on a little ship that he would be the senior naval officer and &quot;have to do something&quot;.

So he ended up in the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. There he was a head of engineering, working on secret weapons such as Panjandrum, a job that appealed to the engineer in him. He also developed the Rocket Spear, an anti-submarine missile with a fluted cast iron head. After the first U-boat was sunk by it, Charles Goodeve sent him a message concluding &quot;I am particularly pleased as it fully substantiates the foresight you showed in pushing this in its early stages. My congratulations.&quot;

His celebrity as a writer caused the Ministry of Information to send him to the Normandy Landings on 6 June 1944 and later to Burma as a correspondent. He finished the war with the rank of lieutenant commander in the RNVR.

== Literary career ==
Shute&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Stephen Morris&quot;, was written in 1923, but not published until 1961 (with its 1924 sequel, &quot;Pilotage&quot;).

His first published novel was &quot;Marazan&quot;, which came out in 1926. After that he averaged one novel every two years until the 1950s, with the exception of a six-year hiatus while he was establishing his own aircraft construction company, Airspeed Ltd. Sales of his books grew slowly with each novel, but he became much better known after the publication of his third to last book, &quot;On the Beach&quot;, in 1957.

Shute&#x27;s novels are written in a simple, highly readable style, with clearly delineated plot lines. Where there is a romantic element, sex is referred to only obliquely. Many of the stories are introduced by a narrator who is not a character in the story. The most common theme in Shute&#x27;s novels is the dignity of work, spanning all classes, whether a Spanish bar hostess in the Balkans (&quot;Ruined City&quot;) or a brilliant but unworldly boffin (&quot;No Highway&quot;). His novels are in three main clusters: early pre-war flying adventures; Second World War tales; and stories set in Australia.

Another recurrent theme is the bridging of social barriers such as class (&quot;Lonely Road&quot; and &quot;Landfall&quot;), race (&quot;The Chequer Board&quot;), or religion (&quot;Round the Bend&quot;). The Australian novels are individual hymns to that country, with subtle disparagement of the mores of the United States (&quot;Beyond the Black Stump&quot;) and overt antipathy towards the post-World War II socialist government of Shute&#x27;s native Britain (&quot;The Far Country&quot; and &quot;In the Wet&quot;).

Shute&#x27;s heroes tended to be like himself: middle-class solicitors, doctors, accountants, bank managers, and engineers—generally university graduates. However (as in &quot;Trustee from the Toolroom&quot;), Shute valued the honest artisans and their social integrity and contributions to society more than the contributions of the upper classes.

Aviation and engineering provide the backdrop for many of Shute&#x27;s novels. He identified how engineering, science, and design could improve human life and more than once used the anonymous epigram, &quot;It has been said an engineer is a man who can do for ten shillings what any fool can do for a pound.&quot;

Several of Shute&#x27;s novels explored the boundary between accepted science and rational belief, on the one hand, and mystical or paranormal possibilities, including reincarnation, on the other hand. Shute did this by including elements of fantasy and science fiction in novels that were considered mainstream. They included Buddhist astrology and folk prophecy in &quot;The Chequer Board&quot;; the effective use of a planchette in &quot;No Highway;&quot; a messiah figure in &quot;Round the Bend&quot;; reincarnation, science fiction, and Aboriginal psychic powers in &quot;In the Wet.&quot;

Twenty-four of his novels and novellas have been published. Many of his books have been adapted for the screen, including &quot;Lonely Road&quot; in 1936; &quot;&quot; in 1949; &quot;Pied Piper&quot; in 1942 and again in 1959, and also as &quot;Crossing to Freedom,&quot; a CBS made-for-television movie, in 1990; &quot;On the Beach&quot; in 1959 and again in 2000 as a two-part miniseries; and &quot;No Highway&quot; in 1951. &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; was adapted into a film in 1956, serialised for Australian television in 1981, and also broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in 1997 starring Jason Connery, Becky Hindley, Bernard Hepton and Virginia McKenna. Shute&#x27;s 1952 novel &quot;The Far Country&quot; was filmed for television as six one-hour episodes in 1972, and as a two-part miniseries in 1987.

Vintage Books reprinted all 23 of his books in 2009.

Shute&#x27;s final work was published more than 40 years after his death. &quot;The Seafarers&quot; was first drafted in 1946–47, rewritten, and then put aside. In 1948, Shute again rewrote it, changing the title to &quot;Blind Understanding,&quot; but he left the manuscript incomplete. According to Dan Telfair in the foreword of the 2002 edition, some of the themes in &quot;The Seafarers&quot; and &quot;Blind Understanding&quot; were used in Shute&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;Requiem for a Wren&quot;.

== Activities after the war ==
In 1948, Shute flew his own Percival Proctor aeroplane to Australia and back, accompanied by the writer James Riddell, who published a book, &quot;Flight of Fancy,&quot; based on the trip, in 1950.

On his return, concerned about what he saw as he &quot;felt oppressed by British taxation&quot;, he decided that he and his family would move to Australia. In 1950, he settled with his wife and two daughters on farmland at Langwarrin, south-east of Melbourne. Remembering his 1930 trip to Canada and his decision to immigrate to Australia, he wrote, in 1954, &quot;For the first time in my life I saw how people live in an English-speaking country outside England.&quot; Although he intended to remain in Australia, he did not apply for Australian citizenship, which was at that time a mere formality because he was a British citizen. In the 1950s and 1960s he was one of the world&#x27;s best-selling novelists. Between 1956 and 1958 in Australia, he took up car racing as a hobby, driving a white Jaguar XK140. Some of this experience found its way into his book &quot;On the Beach&quot;.

Shute died in Melbourne in 1960 after a stroke.

== Honours ==

Norway Road and Nevil Shute Road at Portsmouth Airport, Hampshire were both named after him. Shute Avenue in Berwick, Victoria was named after him, when the farm used for filming the 1959 film &quot;On the Beach&quot; was subdivided for housing.

The public library in Alice Springs, Northern Territory is the Nevil Shute Memorial Library.

In the Readers&#x27; List of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels of the 20th century, &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; came in at number 17, &quot;Trustee from the Toolroom&quot; at 27, and &quot;On the Beach&quot; at 56.

* &quot;The Chequer Board&quot; (1947) . A dying man looks up three wartime comrades, one of whom sees Burma during Japanese occupation and in its independence period after the war. The novel contains a discussion of racism in the US and in the US Army stationed in Britain: British townsfolk prefer the company of black soldiers.
* &quot;No Highway&quot; (1948) . Set in Britain and Canada; an eccentric &quot;boffin&quot; at RAE Farnborough predicts metal fatigue in a new airliner, but is not believed. The Comet failed for just this reason several years later, in 1954.
* &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; (1950) : U.S. title: &quot;The Legacy&quot;. The hero and heroine meet while both are prisoners of the Japanese in Malaya (now Malaysia).

* &quot;Beyond the Black Stump&quot; (1956) . The ethical standards of an unconventional family living in a remote part of Australia are compared with those of a conventional family living in Oregon.
* &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1957) . Shute&#x27;s best-known novel, set in Melbourne, whose population are awaiting death from the effects of an atomic war. It was serialised in more than 40 newspapers, and adapted into a 1959 film starring Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. In 2007, Gideon Haigh wrote an article in &quot;The Monthly&quot; arguing that &quot;On the Beach&quot; is Australia&#x27;s most important novel: &quot;Most novels of apocalypse posit at least a group of survivors and the semblance of hope. &quot;On The Beach&quot; allows nothing of the kind&quot;.
* &quot;The Rainbow and the Rose&quot; (1958) . One man&#x27;s three love stories; narration shifts from the narrator to the main character and back.

<text>Prunus cerasus (sour cherry, tart cherry, or dwarf cherry) is an Old World species of &quot;Prunus&quot; in the subgenus &quot;Cerasus&quot; (cherries). It has two main groups of cultivars: the dark-red Morello cherry and the lighter-red Amarelle cherry. The sour pulp is edible.

==Description==
The tree is smaller than the sweet cherry (growing to a height of 4–10 m), has twiggy branches, and its crimson-to-near-black cherries are borne upon shorter stalks.

It is closely related to the sweet cherry (&quot;Prunus avium&quot;), but has a fruit that is more acidic.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Prunus cerasus&quot;, a tetraploid with 2n=32 chromosomes, is thought to have originated as a natural hybrid between &quot;Prunus avium&quot; and &quot;Prunus fruticosa&quot; in the Iranian Plateau or Eastern Europe where the two species come into contact. &quot;Prunus fruticosa&quot; is believed to have provided its smaller size and sour tasting fruit. The hybrids then stabilized and interbred to form a new, distinct species.

There are two main varieties (groups of cultivars) of the sour cherry: the dark-red Morello cherry and the lighter-red Amarelle cherry.

==Distribution and habitat==

It is native to much of Europe, North Africa and West Asia.

== Cultivation ==
Cultivated sour cherries were selected from wild specimens of &quot;Prunus cerasus&quot; from around the Caspian and Black Seas, and were known to the Greeks in 300 BC. They were also used by Persians and the Romans who introduced them into Britain long before the 1st century AD.

In England, their cultivation was popularized in the 16th century in the time of Henry VIII. They became a common crop amongst Kentish growers, and by 1640 over two dozen named cultivars were recorded.

Before the Second World War there were more than fifty cultivars of sour cherry in cultivation in England; today, however, few are grown commercially, and despite the continuation of named cultivars such as &#x27;Kentish Red&#x27;, &#x27;Amarelles&#x27;, &#x27;Griottes&#x27; and &#x27;Flemish&#x27;, only the generic Morello is offered by most nurseries. This is a late-flowering variety, and thus misses more frosts than its sweet counterpart and is therefore a more reliable cropper. The Morello cherry ripens in mid to late summer, toward the end of August in southern England. It is self-fertile, and would be a good pollenizer for other varieties if it did not flower so late in the season.

Sour cherries require similar cultivation conditions to pears, that is, they prefer a rich, well-drained, moist soil, although they demand more nitrogen and water than sweet cherries. Trees will do badly if waterlogged, but have greater tolerance of poor drainage than sweet varieties. As with sweet cherries, Morellos are traditionally cultivated by budding onto strong growing rootstocks, which produce trees too large for most gardens, although newer dwarfing rootstocks such as &quot;Colt&quot; and &quot;Gisella&quot; are now available. During spring, flowers should be protected, and trees weeded, mulched and sprayed with natural seaweed solution. This is also the time when any required pruning should be carried out (note that cherries should not be pruned during the dormant winter months). Morello cherry trees fruit on younger wood than sweet varieties, and thus can be pruned harder. They are usually grown as standards, but can be fan trained, cropping well even on cold walls, or grown as low bushes.

Sour cherries suffer fewer pests and diseases than sweet cherries, although they are prone to heavy fruit losses from birds. In summer, fruit should be protected with netting. When harvesting fruit, they should be cut from the tree rather than risking damage by pulling the stalks.

Unlike most sweet cherry varieties, sour cherries are self-fertile or self-pollenizing. Two implications of this are that seeds generally run true to the cultivar, and that much smaller pollinator populations are needed because pollen only has to be moved within individual flowers. In areas where pollinators are scarce, growers find that stocking beehives in orchards improves yields.
==Production==

In 2022, world production of sour cherries was 1.6 million tonnes, led by Russia with 19% of the total. Other major producers were Poland, Ukraine, and Turkey.

==Uses==
===Culinary===
The sour pulp is edible. Dried sour cherries are used in cooking including soups, pork dishes, cakes, tarts, and pies. They are also used to make a jam/fruit spread.

Sour cherries are particularly common in Turkey, especially in the form of &quot;vişne suyu&quot; (sour cherry nectar), a widely consumed beverage, and &quot;vişne reçeli&quot; (sour cherry jam), often eaten as part of a traditional breakfast or mixed into plain yoghurt.

Sour cherries or sour cherry syrup are used in liqueurs and drinks, such as the Romanian vișinată or the Portuguese ginjinha. In Iran, Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, sour cherries are prized for making spoon sweets by slowly boiling pitted sour cherries and sugar; the syrup thereof is used for &quot;sharbat-e Albalou&quot;, &quot;vişne şurubu&quot; or &quot;vyssináda&quot;, a beverage made by diluting the syrup with ice-cold water. A particular use of sour cherries is in the production of kriek lambic, a cherry-flavored variety of a naturally fermented beer made in Belgium.
In Germany and Austria, sour cherries are used for desserts such as the donauwelle.

<text>Julius Johannes Ludovicus Ritter von Payer (2 September 1841 – 29 August 1915), ennobled [[Ritter]] von Payer in 1876, was an officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army, mountaineer, arctic explorer, cartographer, painter, and professor at the Theresian Military Academy. He is chiefly known for the Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition in 1872–74 and the discovery of Franz Josef Land.

== Early life and military career==
Born in Schönau, Bohemia, his father Franz Anton Rudolf Payer was a retired officer of the Austrian Uhlans who died when Julius was only fourteen. His mother was Blandine, née John. Payer attended the &quot;k.k.&quot; cadet school in Łobzów near Kraków, Galicia (present-day Poland). Between 1857 and 1859 he studied at the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt.

From 1859, Payer served as a sub-lieutenant with the Austrian 36th infantry regiment in Verona, Venetia. He participated in the disastrous Battle of Solferino on 24 June 1859 and was honoured for his service. After promotion to the rank of lieutenant first class, he was posted to the garrison of Chioggia, Venetia in 1864. On 24 June 1866 he served the Battle of Custoza, seizing two guns, for which he was decorated and elevated to the rank of senior lieutenant.

Since 1863 Payer was assigned as a history and geography teacher to the cadet school in Eisenstadt, Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867) (present-day Austria) and to the Theresian Military Academy. In 1868 the Austro-Hungarian Minister of War Franz Kuhn von Kuhnenfeld appointed him a general staff officer at the &quot;k.k.&quot; Military Geographic Institute in Vienna, where he worked with August von Fligely.

==Alpine exploration==
In 1862 Payer had started exploratory tours of the Tyrolean Alps and the High Tauern range in his free time. After 1864 he explored the Adamello-Presanella Group and the Ortler Alps, making more than 60 first ascents. In 1864 he was, with his guide Giovanni Caturani, the first to climb Adamello (3,554 m) and missed making the first ascent of the Presanella (3,558 m) by just three weeks. All his explorations in the Ortler massif (from 1865 to 1868) were guided by :de:Johann Pinggera from Sulden. Together, often accompanied by a porter, they ascended almost all significant unclimbed summits, including the Hoher Angelus (3,521 m), Vertainspitze (3,545 m), Palon de la Mare (3,703 m), Monte Zebru (3,735), and Monte Cevedale (3,769 m). Their new approach to the Ortler (3,905 m) became the normal route of ascent ever since.

His tours resulted in creating a detailed topographical map at a scale 1:56,000. Due to his achievements, Payer was transferred to the Austrian Military Geographic Institute. When in 1875, the first Alpine club hut above 3000 m was built on the normal route to the Ortler, it was named &quot;:de:Payerhütte&quot; in his honor.

==Polar expedition==

In 1868 he was invited by the German geographer August Petermann to participate in the 2nd German North Polar Expedition as a topographer. Travelling to the coast of East Greenland on the &quot;Germania&quot; under Captain Carl Koldewey in 1869–1870, they reached as far north as Shannon Island. In 1871 he participated in the preliminary Austro-Hungarian expedition to Novaya Zemlya, with Karl Weyprecht.

From 1872 to 1874, Payer led the Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition with Karl Weyprecht, who was Commander at sea, while Payer was Commander on shore. During this voyage they made the discovery of Franz Joseph Land, however upon their return to Vienna many critics voiced doubts about its existence and about the experiences of other participants in the expedition. Payer could have proven his statements using testimonies, diaries and sketches, however his efforts were thwarted, including his promotion to captain. In 1874 he resigned from the army because of political maneuvers against him and his brother officers&#x27; doubts about his discovery and his sledge journeys. He was awarded 44 florins on 1 October 1874 for the discovery of Franz Joseph Land (about equal to the monthly salary of a Sub-lieutenant at the time).
He was also awarded the 1975 Royal Geographical Societys Patron&#x27;s Medal.

However, on 24 October 1876 he was elevated to the Austrian nobility which entitled him and his descendants to the style of &quot;Ritter von&quot; in the case of male and &quot;von&quot; in the case of female offspring.

==Later life==

In 1877 Ritter von Payer married the ex-wife of a banker from Frankfurt am Main. They later had two children, Jules and Alice.

From 1877 to 1879 he studied painting with Heinrich Hasselhorst at the Städelschule in Frankfurt am Main. From 1880 to 1882 he continued his study of art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.

From 1884 to 1890 he worked as a painter in Paris.

In 1890 he divorced his wife, returned to Vienna and founded a painting school for ladies.

In 1895 he planned a trip for painting to Kejser Franz Joseph Fjord in northeastern (Greenland).

In 1912 he planned (at the age of seventy) an expedition in a submarine to the North Pole.

He died in Veldes, in historic Upper Carniola, today part of Slovenia, in 1915.

==Named after Julius von Payer==

Besides the Payerhütte mentioned above and several streets in Vienna, an island of Franz Josef Land (Payer Island), the Payer Mountains in Antarctica and Payer Land in eastern Greenland have been named after Julius von Payer.

The southern satellite camp for the PolAres MARS2013 analog mission by the OeWF, approximately 80 km south of the base camp near Erfoud, Morocco, was named &quot;Station Payer&quot; during February 2013, after the main base camp had been called &quot;Camp Weyprecht&quot; during the landing ceremony in the morning of 11 February 2013.

<text>The Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition was an Arctic expedition to find the North-East Passage that ran from 1872 to 1874 under the leadership of Julius Payer and Karl Weyprecht. The expedition discovered and partially explored Franz Josef Land.

== Background ==
The Austro-Hungarian North Pole expedition was largely an initiative of the geographer August Petermann, who was a proponent of a navigable northern Arctic Sea. Petermann had previously been involved in the German North Pole expeditions of 1868–1870, which had failed to find navigable paths on the east coast of Greenland. Petermann then advocated for probing the area between Svalbard and Novaya Zemlya, which he assumed would be less obstructed by ice due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.

In 1871, a trial expedition took place. Weyprecht and Payer were put in charge. They chartered the Norwegian schooner &quot;Isbjørn&quot; and hired captain Johan Kjeldsen and a Norwegian crew in Tromsø. &quot;Isbjørn&quot; sailed to the east coast of Svalbard, in hopes of reaching Gillis Land. They found heavy sea ice however and were not able to advance from the coast of Nordaustlandet. To salvage the otherwise disappointing expedition, Weyprecht and Payer first conducted some exploration of the islands to the south, before sailing eastwards. Here they did find open water and managed to push far into the Barents Sea. These observed favourable ice conditions justified sending the main expedition into the same direction the following year.

After being dissatisfied with the Norwegians on the reconnaissance voyage with &quot;Isbjørn&quot;, Weyprecht decided to use an Austro-Hungarian crew for the main expedition. It was also decided that a steam vessel would be essential.

== Preparations ==
=== Plan ===
The expedition&#x27;s purpose was to explore the Arctic Ocean to the North of Russia and ideally to find the Northeast Passage. The plan was to travel from Norway to the north coast of Novaya Zemlya and from there via the New Siberian Islands to America, all in 2.5 years. It was also hoped that the exploration of this area might discover land that could be used as a base for reaching the North Pole by sea.

=== Financing ===
The total costs of 222,600 florins were covered mostly by private donations, many from Austro-Hungarian nobles. The main sponsor was Count Johann Nepomuk Wilczek who donated ƒ30,000. Count Franz Salm (1819–1887) donated ƒ20,000. From government ministries and the Academy of Sciences the expedition received ƒ10,340 and ƒ10,000 from the crown. Further important patrons included Count Ödön Zichy (1811–1894), banker (1873–1877), Archduke Rainer of Austria, and Baron Maximilian von Sterneck.

=== Ship ===
The main ship was the &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;, named for the Austrian Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, under whom Weyprecht had served. It was built for this expedition by Teklenborg &amp; Beurmann in Bremerhaven. It was a three-masted barkentine of 220 tons, 38.34 m long, with a 100 horsepower (75 kW) steam engine. Additionally, Count Wilczek personally chartered the sailing boat &quot;Isbjørn&quot; again, for laying an emergency depot.

=== Team ===
The crew came from all over Austria-Hungary, especially from the Eastern Adriatic coast (present-day Croatia), the primary recruiting area for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. They communicated mainly in Italian.

They were accompanied by two dogs from Lappland and six from Vienna, as well as two cats.

==Journey==
On 20 June 1872, the &quot;Isbjørn&quot; set sail from the Norwegian port of Tromsø with the goal of laying a supply depot at Cape Nassau on Novaya Zemlya. Aboard were Count Wilczek, Baron von Sterneck, and Johan Kjeldsen as captain.
The &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; with her crew of 24 left Tromsø on 13 July 1872.
The two ships met near the Barents Islands off Novaya Zemlya, where the emergency depot was laid, in case &quot;Tegetthoff&quot;&#x27;s crew would need supplies on their way back. Having completed her mission, &quot;Isbjørn&quot; then returned to port.
&quot;Tegetthoff&quot; continued northward. At the end of August, she got locked in pack ice north of Novaya Zemlya and drifted to hitherto unknown polar regions. For an extended period of time, the ship was under threat of being crushed by ice. The expedition members frequently prepared to abandon ship.

On 30 August 1873, after one year in the ice, the explorers discovered an archipelago which they named Franz Josef Land after Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I. &quot;Tegetthoff&quot; continued to drift until the end of October, when the ship came to a halt by an island in the southeast of Franz Josef Land. In November, several small trips were made to the newly named Wilczek Island, before having to wait out the polar night for further exploration.

In February 1874, Weyprecht and Payer decided to abandon the ice-locked ship after completing sledge expeditions to explore the newly discovered lands. The first of these went to Hall Island where the expedition members climbed Cape Tegetthoff and Sonklar glacier. The temperature on the glacier fell as low as .

The day after the return of the sledge party, Otto Krisch, who had stayed at the ship, died of tuberculosis. He had already reported suffering from chest pain in November 1872. Dr. Kepes later wrote that his symptoms had been worrying since April 1873. In February 1874, he had additionally contracted scurvy. Scurvy had also been a problem for other crew members but they were able to cure it with canned vegetables, lemon juice, wine, and polar bear meat. Krisch was buried in a crevice on Wilczek Island. The grave was sealed with a rock and fitted with a wooden cross.

The second sledge trip took 27 days. During the trip, the men were always running the risk that the sea ice would shift or open up and that they would not be able to return to the ship. They followed the Austrian Strait to the north, Payer surveying at various points along the way. The exploratory work meant that much of the eastern part of Franz Josef Land could be mapped. While crossing Middendorf Glacier on Rudolf Island, Zaninovich, together with the sled and dogs, fell into a crevasse. As an experienced alpinist, Haller was able to descend and rescue Zaninovich, the dogs, and the sledge with most of the equipment. They reached the northernmost point of Franz Josef Land, Cape Fligely () on 12 April 1874. Payer believed to have seen land further north, which he called King Oscar Land and Petermann Land.

A third trip to McClintock Island was conducted for additional surveying.

On 20 May 1874, they left the ship and tried to reach Novaya Zemlya. They initially took three boats, each mounted on a sled, as well as provisions and equipment for 3–4 months on three additional sledges. Each sledge weighed about . A small dog-sled was also employed. They proceeded by hauling the boat-sleds for some distance, then returning to retrieve the additional sledges. The group made very slow progress over ice full of hummocks, cracks, ridges, and polynyas. Only after eight days had they advanced out of sight of the ship. On 1 July, they were unable to advance further and retreated to Lamont Island which they had found on the way. Weyprecht decided to briefly go back to the ship and retrieve a fourth boat while waiting for the ice conditions to improve. On 10 July, they continued southwards, sometimes hauling the sledges and sometimes rowing the boats across a polynya. Weyprecht noted some complaints about Payer&#x27;s behaviour in his diary, but was quite proud of how harmonious and loyal the men were.
On 14 August 1874, the expedition reached the open sea. The two remaining dogs had to be shot as they became seasick and destabilised the boats. After three days of rowing, they reached Novaya Zemlya. They aimed for the depot laid by Wilczek, but after accidentally rowing past it, decided to continue south and rely on the provisions they still had. On 24 August, the boats of the Austro-Hungarian expedition met with fishermen from the Russian schooner &quot;Nikolai&quot;, captained by . They were received warmly by the Russian sailors who were greatly impressed by the expedition&#x27;s Russian Ukase containing instructions to aid them. Weyprecht and Payer agreed with Voronin to deliver the expedition to Vardø in Northern Norway for 1200 silver rubles, three expedition boats, and two Lefaucheux guns. They reached Vardø on 3 September.

The expedition returned to Austria-Hungary by coastal steamer from Vardø and by train from Hamburg. On the journey they were met by crowds and invited to dinners hosted by local dignitaries and geographical societies in Norway, Sweden and Germany. They entered Vienna in triumph, welcomed, according to contemporary newspaper reports, by hundreds of thousands of people. Further festivities followed throughout Austria-Hungary as the individual explorers returned to their homes.

==Significance==

The expedition&#x27;s discoveries and experiences made a significant contribution to polar science, especially the discovery of the Northeast passage by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. They also gave an impetus to International Polar Years, meaning a shift from sports-like races of single expeditions to worldwide scientific cooperation in exploring the polar regions.

The expedition yielded various results in the fields of meteorology, astronomy, geodesy, magnetism, zoology, and sightings of Aurora Borealis. They were published by the Academy of Sciences in 1878. There is a book (&quot;The Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition 1872-74&quot;) and paintings by Payer - probably the only paintings of a polar expedition created by the explorer himself.

==Memory==

In Vienna, Graz, and Wiener Neustadt there are several streets and inns that are named after the North Pole, Payer, Weyprecht, Wilczek, and Krisch. Payer was knighted in 1876.

Impressed by the expedition, Eduard Strauss composed the &quot;Weyprecht Payer March&quot; in 1875.

In 1978, Russian scientist Vladimir Serov found a message in a bottle left by Weyprecht on Lamont Island. It is now held by the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

The expedition was selected as the main motif for the Austrian Admiral Tegetthoff Ship and The Polar Expedition commemorative coin minted on June 8, 2005. The reverse side of the coin shows two explorers in Arctic gear with the frozen ship behind them.

<text>Georg Balthazar von Neumayer (21 June 1826 – 24 May 1909) was a German polar explorer and scientist who was a proponent of the idea of international cooperation for meteorology and scientific observation. He served as a hydrographer for the German Empire and was a founder of the Wilhelmshaven Observatory and the German Maritime Observatory which he directed from 1875. He was involved in establishing telegraphic networks for the sharing of meteorological data as well as promoting observatories in the Antarctic and Australia. Along with Carl Weyprecht, he was a founder of the International Polar Commission in 1879. In 1900 he was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown with the associated title of Ritter von Neumayer.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Born in Kirchheimbolanden, Palatinate, Neumayer was the fifth child of notary Georg and his wife Theresia, née Kirchner. He went to the Frankenthal gymnasium as well as schools in Speyer and Kaiserlautern before he went to study geophysics and hydrography at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Bavaria in 1849; and becoming much interested in polar exploration, continued his studies in terrestrial magnetism, oceanography, navigation, and nautical astronomy. To obtain practical experience he made a voyage to South America on the Hamburg barque &quot;Louise&quot;, and after his return gave a series of lectures at Hamburg on Maury&#x27;s theories of the ocean, and recent improvements in navigation. He then decided to go to Australia, shipped as a sailor , and arrived at Sydney in 1852.

===Australia===

Neumayer was one of a number of influential German-speaking residents such as Ludwig Becker, Hermann Beckler, William Blandowski, Amalie Dietrich, Wilhelm Haacke, Diedrich Henne, Gerard Krefft, Johann Luehmann, Johann Menge, Carl Mücke (a.k.a. Muecke), Ludwig Preiss, Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker (a.k.a. Ruemker), Moritz Richard Schomburgk, Richard Wolfgang Semon, Karl Theodor Staiger, George Ulrich, Eugene von Guérard, Robert von Lendenfeld, Ferdinand von Mueller, and Carl Wilhelmi who brought their &quot;epistemic traditions&quot; to Australia, and not only became &quot;deeply entangled with the Australian colonial project&quot;, but also were &quot;intricately involved in imagining, knowing and shaping colonial Australia&quot; (Barrett, et al., 2018, p.2).

After trying his fortune on the goldfields, Neumayer gave lectures on navigation to seamen, and spent some time in Tasmania at the observatory in Hobart. He returned to Germany in 1854 convinced that Australia offered a great field for scientific exploration, obtained the support of the King of Bavaria and encouragement from leading British scientists. He sailed again for Australia and arrived in Melbourne in January 1857. He asked the government of Victoria to provide him with a site for an observatory, about £700 for a building, and about £600 a year for expenses. He had brought with him a collection of magnetical, nautical and meteorological instruments valued at £2000, which had been provided by the King of Bavaria.

Neumayer suggested as a suitable site a block of land not far from the present position of the observatory, but this was not granted. He was, however, allowed the use of the buildings of the signal station on Flagstaff Hill creating the Flagstaff Observatory for Geophysics, Magnetism and Nautical Science at what is now Flagstaff Gardens in Melbourne, Australia. From 1 March 1858 he carried on the systematic registration of meteorological and nautical data. A few weeks later he added regular observations on atmospheric electricity and changes in the magnetic elements.

Between 1858 and 1863, he, and a team of assistants, extracted data from hundreds of ship logbooks that was then analysed to find the best route of maximum speed and safety for sailing ships travelling between Europe and Australia. To obtain the logbooks he placed advertisements in the Victorian &quot;Government Gazette&quot;, and posted signs at the Melbourne Customs House, requesting the masters of arriving vessels to deposit their logbooks at his offices in the Flagstaff Observatory with a promise they would be returned within four days. More than 600 logs were examined and the information extracted was analysed and the conclusions published in the second half of a book published in 1864. He was also involved in continuing studies begun earlier to drop bottles with messages to reconstruct currents based on recoveries.

Neumayer was elected a councillor of the Royal Society of Victoria in 1859, a vice-president in 1860 and a life member in 1864.

=== Burke and Wills Expedition ===

William John Wills, second-in-command of the Burke and Wills expedition succeeded J. W. Osborne as Neumayer&#x27;s assistant at the Flagstaff Observatory until the expedition departed from Melbourne on 20 August 1860. Neumayer was a member of the &quot;Exploration Committee&quot; of the Royal Society of Victoria which organised the Expedition. Neumayer joined the Expedition at Swan Hill in order to conduct his magnetic observations. He remained with Burke and Wills as far as the Darling River at Bilbarka, before returning to the settled districts of Victoria.

=== Legacy ===

He published in 1860, &quot;Results of the Magnetical, Nautical and Meteorological Observations from March 1858 to February 1859&quot;, and did a large amount of travelling in Victoria in connection with his magnetic survey of the colony. He published his &quot;Results of the Meteorological Observations 1859-1862&quot; and &quot;Nautical Observations 1858-1862&quot; in 1864, and in the same year returned to Germany. In 1867 he brought out his &quot;Discussion of the Meteorological and Magnetical Observations made at the Flagstaff Observatory&quot;, and in 1869 appeared his extremely valuable Results of the &quot;Magnetic Survey of the Colony of Victoria—1858-1864&quot;.

Later, he organized the &quot;Gazelle Expedition&quot; (1874-1876), so named as it was conducted aboard the German steam frigate . and was director of the hydrographic organisation &quot;Deutsche Seewarte&quot; (1876-1903). He chaired the International Polar Commission in 1879 together with Karl Weyprecht, founding the first International Polar Year 1882/83 and the Antarctic Year 1901. In 1895, von Neumayer had established the German Commission for South Polar Exploration, which culminated in the First German Antarctica Expedition in 1901, the so-called &quot;Gauss&quot; expedition.

In 1890 he co-authored the first cloud atlas.

Polar explorer Roald Amundsen came to study under Neumayer in 1900. In the same year, Neumayer was designated a Commander of the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown, including the right to furthermore have his surname preceded by &#x27;Ritter von&#x27; (&#x27;Knight of&#x27;).

Neumayer died in 1909 in Neustadt an der Weinstraße. He gave his name to the German Polar Research Station in Antarctica, the now abandoned &quot;Neumayer Station&quot;. This year-round manned station is totally covered with ice and snow (buried 10 meters under the surface) and is situated in the Weddell-Sea area (08 15W, 70 35S). The successor was the Neumayer Station II which was then abandoned itself. The only station in use now is the Neumayer Station III. Research topics are permanent observations of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, seismological registrations, infrasonic, meteorological and air chemistry investigations.

<text>Vampire literature covers the spectrum of literary work concerned principally with the subject of vampires. The literary vampire first appeared in 18th-century poetry, before becoming one of the stock figures of gothic fiction with the publication of Polidori&#x27;s &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819), inspired by a story told to him by Lord Byron. Later influential works include the penny dreadful &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; (1847); Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s tale of a lesbian vampire, &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1872), and the most well known: Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897). Some authors created a more &quot;sympathetic vampire&quot;, with &quot;Varney&quot; being the first, and more recent examples such as Moto Hagio&#x27;s series &quot;The Poe Clan&quot; (1972–1976) and Anne Rice&#x27;s novel &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1976) proving influential.

==History==

===18th century===
Vampire fiction is rooted in the &quot;vampire craze&quot; of the 1720s and 1730s, which culminated in the somewhat bizarre official exhumations of suspected vampires Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole in Serbia under the Habsburg monarchy. One of the first works of art to touch upon the subject is the short German poem &quot;The Vampire&quot; (1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder, where the theme already has strong erotic overtones: a man whose love is rejected by a respectable and pious maiden threatens to pay her a nightly visit, drink her blood by giving her the seductive kiss of the vampire and thus prove to her that his teaching is better than her mother&#x27;s Christianity. Furthermore, there have been a number of tales about a dead person returning from the grave to visit his/her beloved or spouse and bring them death in one way or another, the narrative poem &quot;Lenore&quot; (1773) by Gottfried August Bürger being a notable 18th-century example (though the apparently returned lover is actually revealed to be death himself in disguise). One of its lines, &quot;Denn die Todten reiten schnell&quot; (&quot;For the dead ride fast&quot;), was to be quoted in Bram Stoker&#x27;s classic &quot;Dracula&quot;. A later German poem exploring the same subject with a prominent vampiric element was &quot;The Bride of Corinth&quot; (1797) by Goethe, a story about a young woman who returns from the grave to seek her betrothed:

The story is turned into an expression of the conflict between Heathendom and Christianity: the family of the dead girl are Christians, while the young man and his relatives are still pagans. It turns out that it was the girl&#x27;s Christian mother who broke off her engagement and forced her to become a nun, eventually driving her to her death. The motive behind the girl&#x27;s return as a &quot;spectre&quot; is that &quot;e&#x27;en Earth can never cool down love&quot;. Goethe had been inspired by the story of &quot;Philinnion&quot; by Phlegon of Tralles, a tale from classical Greece. However, in that tale, the youth is not the girl&#x27;s betrothed, no religious conflict is present, no actual sucking of blood occurs, and the girl&#x27;s return from the dead is said to be sanctioned by the gods of the Underworld. She relapses into death upon being exposed, and the issue is settled by burning her body outside of the city walls and making an apotropaic sacrifice to the deities involved.

===19th century===
The first mention of vampires in English literature appears in Robert Southey&#x27;s monumental oriental epic poem &quot;Thalaba the Destroyer&quot; (1801), where the main character Thalaba&#x27;s deceased beloved Oneiza turns into a vampire, although that occurrence is actually marginal to the story. It has been argued that Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;Christabel&quot; (written between 1797 and 1801, but not published until 1816) has influenced the development of vampire fiction: the heroine Christabel is seduced by a female supernatural being called Geraldine who tricks her way into her residence. Though Coleridge never finished the poem, some argue that his intended plot had Geraldine eventually trying to marry Christabel after having assumed the appearance of Christabel&#x27;s absent lover. The story bears a remarkable resemblance to the overtly vampiric story of Carmilla by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu (1872).

In a passage in his epic poem &quot;The Giaour&quot; (1813), Lord Byron alludes to the traditional folkloric conception of the vampire as a being damned to suck the blood and destroy the life of its nearest relations:
But first, on earth as vampire sent, Thy corpse shall from its tomb be rent: Then ghostly haunt thy native place, And suck the blood of all thy race;

There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce Must feed thy livid living corpse: Thy victims ere they yet expire Shall know thy demon for their sire, As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
Byron also composed an enigmatic fragmentary story, published as &quot;A Fragment&quot; in 1819 as part of the &quot;Mazeppa&quot; collection, concerning the mysterious fate of an aristocrat named Augustus Darvell whilst journeying in the Orient—as his contribution to the famous ghost story competition at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva in the summer of 1816, between him, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and John William Polidori (who was Byron&#x27;s personal physician). This story provided the basis for &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819) by Polidori. Byron&#x27;s own wild life became the model for Polidori&#x27;s undead protagonist Lord Ruthven. According to A. Asbjorn Jon, &quot;the choice of name [for Polidori&#x27;s Lord Ruthven] is presumably linked to Lady Caroline Lamb&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Glenarvon&quot;, where it was used for a rather ill disguised Byronesque character&quot;.

An unauthorized sequel to Polidori&#x27;s tale by Cyprien Bérard called &quot;Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires&quot; (1820) was attributed to Charles Nodier. Nodier himself adapted &quot;The Vampyre&quot; into the first vampire stage melodrama, &quot;Le Vampire&quot;. Unlike Polidori&#x27;s original story, Nodier&#x27;s play was set in Scotland. This, in turn, was adapted by the English melodramatist James Planché as &quot;The Vampire; or, the Bride of the Isles&quot; (1820) at the Lyceum (then called the English Opera House), also set in Scotland. Planché introduced the &quot;vampire trap&quot; as a way for the title fiend to appear in a dream at the beginning and then to vanish into the earth at his destruction. Nodier&#x27;s play was also the basis of an opera called &quot;Der Vampyr&quot; by the German composer Heinrich Marschner, who set the story in a more plausible Wallachia. Planché in turn translated the libretto of this opera into English in 1827, where it was performed at the Lyceum also. Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot; later redramatized the story in a play also entitled &quot;Le Vampire&quot; (1851). Another theatrical vampire of this period was &quot;Sir Alan Raby&quot;, who is the lead character of &quot;The Vampire&quot; (1852), a play by Dion Boucicault. Boucicault himself played the lead role to great effect, though the play itself had mixed reviews. Queen Victoria, who saw the play, described it in her diary as &quot;very trashy&quot;.

An important later example of 19th-century vampire fiction is the penny dreadful epic &quot;Varney the Vampire&quot; (1847), featuring Sir Francis Varney as the vampire. In this story, we have the first example of the standard trope in which the vampire comes through the window at night and attacks a maiden as she lies sleeping. Heathcliff in Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1847) is suspected of being a vampire by his housekeeper at one point, which he immediately laughs off as &quot;absurd nonsense&quot;.

Fascinating erotic fixations are evident in Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s classic novella &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1872), which features a female vampire with lesbian inclinations who seduces the heroine Laura while draining her of her vital fluids. Le Fanu&#x27;s story is set in the Duchy of Styria. Such central European locations became a standard feature of vampire fiction.

Another important example of the development of vampire fiction can be found in three seminal novels by Paul Féval: &quot;Le Chevalier Ténèbre&quot; (1860), &quot;La Vampire&quot; (1865) and &quot;La Ville Vampire&quot; (1874). Marie Nizet&#x27;s &quot;Le Capitaine Vampire&quot; (1879) features a Russian officer, Boris Liatoukine, who is a vampire.

In German literature, one of the most popular novels was Hans Wachenhusen&#x27;s &quot;Der Vampyr – Novelle aus Bulgarien&quot; (1878), which, on account of the author&#x27;s first-hand experience of Ottoman society, includes a detailed description of the multicultural society of Bulgaria, and which contains an atmosphere that is &quot;in some parts comparable to &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;.

The most famous Serbian vampire was Sava Savanović, from a folklore-inspired novel, &quot;Ninety Years Later&quot;, by Milovan Glišić, first published in 1880. Serbian vampires—albeit depicted first in French (1839) and then Russian (1884)—also appear in Count Tolstoy&#x27;s novella &quot;The Family of the Vourdalak&quot;. 

Karl Heinrich Ulrichs published the short story “Manor” in 1885, about two sailors and lovers. When the older of the two, Manor, drowns at sea he returns to his lover Har each night to suck his blood and lay together. 

====&quot;Dracula&quot;====
Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1897) has been the definitive description of the vampire in popular fiction for the last century. Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease (contagious demonic possession), with its undertones of sex, blood, and death, struck a chord in a Victorian Britain where tuberculosis and syphilis were common.

Although it has been claimed that the character of Count Dracula is based upon Vlad Draculesti III (Vlad the Impaler), also known as Vlad Ţepeş&#x27;, a notorious 15th-century Wallachian (Romanian) warlord, or Voivode, this has been debunked by multiple scholars. Unlike the historical personage, however, Stoker located his Count Dracula in a castle near the Borgo Pass in Transylvania, and ascribed to that area the supernatural aura it retains to this day in the popular imagination.

Stoker likely drew inspiration from Irish myths of blood-sucking creatures. He was also influenced by Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Carmilla&quot;. Le Fanu was Stoker&#x27;s editor when Stoker was a theater critic in Dublin, Ireland. Like Le Fanu, Stoker created compelling female vampire characters such as Lucy Westenra and the Brides of Dracula.

Stoker&#x27;s vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing was a strong influence on subsequent vampire literature.

===20th century===

Though Stoker&#x27;s Count Dracula remained an iconic figure, especially in the new medium of cinema, as in the film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, 20th-century vampire fiction went beyond traditional Gothic horror and explored new genres such as science fiction. An early example of this is Gustave Le Rouge&#x27;s &quot;Le prisonnier de la planète Mars&quot; (1908) and its sequel &quot;La guerre des vampires&quot; (1909), in which a native race of bat-winged, blood-drinking humanoids is found on Mars. In the 1920 novella &quot;La Jeune Vampire&quot; (&quot;The Young Vampire&quot;), by J.-H. Rosny aîné, vampirism is explained as a form of possession by souls originating in another universe known simply as the Beyond.

Possibly the most influential example of modern vampire science fiction is Richard Matheson&#x27;s &quot;I Am Legend&quot; (1954). The novel is set in a future Los Angeles overrun with undead cannibalistic/bloodsucking beings. The protagonist is the sole survivor of a pandemic of a bacterium that causes vampirism. He must fight to survive attacks from the hordes of nocturnal creatures, discover the secrets of their biology, and develop effective countermeasures. The novel was adapted into three movies: &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot; starring Vincent Price in 1964, &quot;The Omega Man&quot; starring Charlton Heston in 1971, and &quot;I am Legend&quot; starring Will Smith in 2007.

The latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer Marilyn Ross&#x27;s &quot;Barnabas Collins&quot; series (1966–71) loosely based on the contemporary American TV soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic, tragic heroes rather than as the traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in the popular &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; (1976-2018) series of novels by Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro&#x27;s massive Saint-Germain series (1978–). Ross, Rice and Yarbro set the trend for multi-volume vampire sagas which are now a stock feature of mass-market fiction (see below for list). Rice&#x27;s work also saw the beginning of the convergence of traditional Gothic ideas with the modern Gothic subculture and a more explicit exploration of the transgressive sexualities which had always been implicit in vampire fiction.

Stephen King, while not a writer of multi-volume epics on vampires, has become a very influential horror writer of the late 20th and early 21st century, evidenced by the nearly sixty books he has published over the past 50 years selling around the world in multiple languages. King&#x27;s repertoire often hybridizes traditional vampire folklore with the coy charm inspired by Bela Lugosi&#x27;s performance while increasing the physical violence, carnage, and overall butchery. His work describes very graphically in detail the ruthlessness of what essentially is a supernatural, parasitic predator that unleashes itself and intrudes on ordinary life for ordinary people, a recurring theme of his books. According to King himself, he was still a teacher at a high school when one of the books the class was studying was Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula.&quot; Over dinner, he asked his wife, Tabitha, what would happen if Dracula came back in the 20th century. &quot;He&#x27;d probably be run over by a Yellow Cab on Park Avenue and killed,&quot; his wife replied, and it was from there that she suggested a different, rural setting.

&quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot,&quot; the book that resulted from that conversation, was published in 1975 as the follow-up to &quot;Carrie&quot;&quot;;&quot; as of 2022, the process of weaving vampires into his stories is still ongoing. King&#x27;s overall body of work spans both the late 20th and early 21st centuries and &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; has over the years become one of his most important works. The title references a Maine town called Jerusalem&#x27;s Lot and it is the centerpiece of 2 full novels and one short story, plus twelve other books that reference the town&#x27;s existence within the multiverse that runs through all Stephen King books. King acknowledged the influence of &quot;Dracula&quot; on the work, as well as the violent, pre-Comics Code vampires portrayed in horror comics such as those released by E.C. Comics. King also has written several other works with vampires included in them in both long and short form including &quot;The Little Sisters of Elluria&quot; (1998), &quot;The Nightflier&quot; (1993, in &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;), and several books in his series &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; (1982-2012) which also contains at least one character from &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;. Many of these have been brought to film and television as well as comic books.

The 1981 novel &quot;The Hunger&quot; (adapted as a film in 1983) continued the theme of open sexuality and examined the biology of vampires, suggesting that their special abilities were the result of physical properties of their blood. The novel suggested that not all vampires were undead humans, but some were a separate species that had evolved alongside humans. This interpretation of vampires has since then been used in several science-fiction stories dealing with vampires, most famously the &quot;Blade&quot; movie series. The 1982 novel &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; by notable author George R. R. Martin tells the tale of a race of living vampires, extremely human-like but obligate predators on humans, set in the Mississippi Riverboat era, where one of them has developed a dietary supplement to &quot;cure&quot; them, and is fighting for the right and opportunity to distribute it.

Kim Newman&#x27;s &quot;Anno Dracula&quot; series (1992–) returns to Stoker&#x27;s Count Dracula, looking at an alternate world where Dracula defeated Van Helsing&#x27;s group and conquered Britain, and gives the genre a somewhat postmodern spin. The television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, created and largely written by Joss Whedon, also explored vampire folklore in the light of postmodern and feminist theory, defining the &#x27;condition&#x27; as humans who were made to drink vampire blood after the vampire drinks from them, with turned vampires being essentially demons possessing human corpses; &quot;Buffy&quot; and its spin-off, &quot;Angel&quot;, also feature the character of Angel in a prominent role, with Angel being a vampire who was cursed with his soul, restoring his capacity for compassion, but also forcing him to live with the guilt of what he did as a regular vampire.

Post-Colonial perspectives on the vampire legend are provided in Nalo Hopkinson&#x27;s novel &quot;Brown Girl In The Ring&quot; (1998), which features the Soucouyant, a vampire of Caribbean folklore, and in Tananarive Due&#x27;s &quot;My Soul to Keep&quot; (1995) and its sequel &quot;The Living Blood&quot; (2001).
In 1989, a comprehensive bibliography of vampire literature was published – Margaret L. Carter&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire in Literature. A Critical Bibliography&quot; (Ann Arbor, Michigan, U.S.: Umi Research Press).

One of the best-known stories of Nobel Prize winning Israeli writer Shmuel Yosef Agnon is &quot;The Lady and the Peddler&quot; (). It tells of Yosef the Peddler who wanders a great East European forest and encounters a lonely house inhabited by a mysterious lady named Helen. First finding refuge there from a pouring rain, he is eventually seduced to stay and enter into a sexual relationship. Eventually, however, he discovers that she is in the habit of killing her husbands, devouring them and drinking their blood, which keeps her young and beautiful, and that she had done it to 17 men before him. She also tries to kill Yosef but fails, wounds herself and eventually dies. She is then eaten by birds while Yosef the Peddler picks up his pack and resumes his wanderings.

===21st century===
Many books based on vampires are still being published, including several continuing series. Paranormal romance, inspired by Anne Rice, but mostly dropping the open sexuality of her characters in favor of more conventional sexual roles, is a remarkable contemporary publishing phenomenon. Romances with handsome vampires as the male lead include Lynsay Sands&#x27; Argeneau family series (2003–), Charlaine Harris &quot;The Southern Vampire Mysteries&quot; series (2001–2013), and Christine Feehan&#x27;s Carpathian series (1999–). However, Laurell K. Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter&quot; series has again shifted the genre boundaries from romance back toward the territory of erotica.

The occult detective subgenre is represented by Jim Butcher&#x27;s &quot;The Dresden Files&quot; fantasy series (2000–), and Charlaine Harris&#x27;s &quot;The Southern Vampire Mysteries&quot; (2001–).

In the field of juvenile and young adult literature, Darren Shan wrote a 12-book series (&quot;The Saga of Darren Shan&quot;) about a boy who becomes a vampire&#x27;s assistant, beginning with &quot;Cirque Du Freak&quot; (2000) and ending with &quot;Sons of Destiny&quot; (2006). A film adaptation has been made of the first three books called &quot;Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&#x27;s Assistant&quot; (2009). He is also currently writing a prequel to the &quot;Saga&quot;, a series of four books all about Larten Crepsley (one of the main characters) starting with &quot;Birth of a Killer&quot; (2010) and finishing with &quot;Brothers to the Death&quot; (2012). Ellen Schreiber created a young adult series about Raven Madison and her vampire boyfriend Alexander Sterling, starting with &quot;Vampire Kisses&quot; (2005). In Scott Westerfeld&#x27;s young adult novel &quot;Peeps&quot; (2005), the protagonist carries a contagious parasite that causes vampire-like behavior.

Count Dracula also continues to inspire novelists, for example Elizabeth Kostova in &quot;The Historian&quot; (2005).

Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist&#x27;s critically praised vampire story &quot;Låt den rätte komma in&quot; (2004), about the relationship of a 12-year-old boy with a 200-year-old vampire child, has now been translated into English as &quot;Let the Right One In&quot; (2007) and a film adaptation has been produced. The story takes place in Blackeberg, a suburb of Stockholm. This particular novel does not follow the modern romantic trend, and instead focuses on a human-vampire friendship. Crucially, it retains many of the vampire traits popularized by &quot;Dracula&quot;.

Dimitris Lyacos&#x27;s second book of the &quot;Poena Damni&quot; trilogy &quot;With the People from the Bridge&quot; handles the vampire legend in the context of a ritualistic post-theatrical drama performance. In a dystopian setting, under the arches of a derelict bridge, a group of social outcasts present an unconventional, non-Gothic version of a vampire drawing from ancient Greek religion and literature, Christian eschatology as well as traveler reports of vampire epidemics in the Balcans. The story is recounted in a minimalist style that makes no explicit mention to vampires, the undead, graves or the Underworld, conveying, nevertheless, the underlying theme unambiguously and in striking physical detail.

Peter Watts&#x27; novel &quot;Blindsight&quot; has explored a scientific basis for vampires, depicting them as an evolutionary offshoot from humanity who were not the dominant species on the planet solely due to an evolutionary glitch making them averse to Euclidean geometry (right angles cause seizures in what is called &quot;Crucifix Glitch&quot;, leading to them dying out when modern technology with all its structures swept the world). Implied to have vastly superior intelligence and problem-solving capabilities, they were recreated from gene snippets for special tasks, with special drugs alleviating their crucifix glitch. One particularly important vampire trait is their ability to hibernate for extended periods of time, which makes cryogenic stasis possible and is applied to astronauts via gene-therapy. At the end of the novel it is implied the vampires have taken control of earth and may be exterminating baseline humanity.

In recent years, vampire fiction has been one of many supernatural fiction genres used in the creation of mashups. These works combine either a pre-existing text or a historic figure with elements of genre fiction. One of the best-known of these works is &quot;Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter&quot; by Seth Grahame-Smith, in which the historic Abraham Lincoln has a fictional secret identity as a hunter of evil vampires.

The 21st century brought more examples of vampire fiction, such as J. R. Ward&#x27;s Black Dagger Brotherhood series, and other highly popular vampire books which appeal to teenagers and young adults. Such vampiric paranormal romance novels and allied vampiric chick-lit and vampiric occult detective stories are a remarkably popular and ever-expanding contemporary publishing phenomenon. L. A. Banks&#x27; &quot;The Vampire Huntress Legend Series&quot;, Laurell K. Hamilton&#x27;s erotic &quot;Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter&quot; series, and Kim Harrison&#x27;s &quot;The Hollows&quot; series, portray the vampire in a variety of new perspectives, some of them unrelated to the original legends. Vampires in the &quot;Twilight&quot; series (2005–2008) by Stephenie Meyer ignore the effects of garlic and crosses and are not harmed by sunlight, although it does reveal their supernatural status. Richelle Mead further deviates from traditional vampires in her &quot;Vampire Academy&quot; series (2007–2010), basing the novels on Romanian lore with two races of vampires, one good and one evil, as well as half-vampires.

==Traits of vampires in fiction==

The traits of the literary vampire have evolved from the often repulsive figures of folklore. Fictional vampires can be romantic figures, often described as elegant and sexy (compare demons such as succubi and incubi). This is in stark contrast to the vampire of Eastern European folklore, which was a horrifying animated corpse. However, as in folklore, the literary vampire is sustained by drinking blood. They do not need other food, water, or even oxygen. They are sometimes portrayed as being unable to eat human food at all, forcing them to either avoid public dining or mime chewing and eating to deceive their mortal victims. The fictional vampire, however, often has a pale appearance rather than the dark or ruddy skin of folkloric vampires and their skin is cool to the touch. As in folklore, literary vampires can usually be warded off with garlic and symbols of the Christian faith, such as holy water, a crucifix, or a rosary.

According to literary scholar Nina Auerbach in &quot;Our Vampires, Ourselves&quot;, the influence of the moon was seen as dominant in the earliest examples of vampire literature:

Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; was hugely influential in its depiction of vampire traits, some of which are described by the novel&#x27;s vampire expert Abraham Van Helsing. 
Dracula has the ability to change his shape at will, his featured forms in the novel being that of a wolf, bat, mist and fog. He can also crawl up and down the vertical external walls of his castle in the manner of a lizard. One very famous trait that Stoker added is the inability to be seen in mirrors, which is not found in traditional Eastern European folklore, as Stoker combined the folklore of Jiangshi being terrified of their own reflection with the material fact of the silver backed mirrors of the time. Dracula also had protruding teeth, though was preceded in this by Varney the Vampire and Carmilla.
In Anne Rice&#x27;s books, the vampires appear their best self of the age they were turned into a vampire; for instance, when Claudia was turned into a vampire, her golden curls became tight and voluminous, her skin turns a pale but smooth and clear, and rids her of the rotting disease. But it also seems like a curse as she retains her child-body for her entire vampire lifetime and any modifications on her body, such as even cutting her hair, grows it back to the same length as it was before.
A similar occurrence can be observed in the &quot;Twilight&quot; series - when Bella is turned into a vampire, her wounds heal, hair becomes healthy and shiny, her broken back and ribs get mended, the color comes back to her skin, and her sunken eyes, cheeks and skinny body return to a healthy state; in fact she is brought back to life from the brink of death by turning her into a vampire.

In the &quot;Dracula&quot; novel, the vampire hunter Van Helsing prescribes that a vampire be destroyed by a wooden stake (preferably made of white oak) through the heart, decapitation, drowning, or incineration. The vampire&#x27;s head must be removed from its body, the mouth stuffed with garlic and holy water or relics, the body drawn and quartered, then burned and spread into the four winds, with the head buried on hallowed ground. The destruction of the vampire Lucy follows the three-part process enjoined by Van Helsing (staking, decapitation, and garlic in the mouth). 

Traditional vampire folklore, followed by Stoker in &quot;Dracula&quot;, does not usually hold that sunlight is fatal to vampires, though they are nocturnal. It is also notable in the novel that Dracula can walk about in the daylight, in bright sunshine, though apparently in discomfort and without the ability to use most of his powers, like turning into mist or a bat. He is still strong and fast enough to struggle with and escape from most of his male pursuers. Fatal exposure to sunlight of a vampire in their coffin dates at least as far back as &quot;The Story Of Yand Manor House&quot; (1898) by E. and H. Heron; such scenes in vampire films however, most especially 1922&#x27;s &quot;Nosferatu&quot; and the closing scene of the 1958 film &quot;Dracula&quot; in which Count Dracula is burnt by the sun, were very influential on later vampire fiction. For instance, Anne Rice&#x27;s vampire Lestat and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro&#x27;s Count Saint-Germain both avoid the lethal effects of daylight by staying closeted indoors during the day.

A well-known set of special powers and weaknesses is commonly associated with vampires in contemporary fiction. There is a tendency, however, for authors to pick and choose the ones they like, or find more realistic ones, and have their characters ridicule the rest as absurd. For example, in the movie &quot;Blade&quot;, the vampire hunter Blade tells Karen Jenson what kills vampires (stakes, silver, and sunlight), and dismisses tactics seen in vampire movies (namely crosses and running water) as ineffective. Some vampires can fly. This power may be supernatural levitation, or it may be connected to the vampire&#x27;s shape-shifting ability. Some traditions hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless he or she is invited in. Generally, a vampire needs be invited in only once and then can come and go at will. Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; explored an unusual direction with this myth in having one of the protagonists revoke a vampire&#x27;s invitation to a house; the vampire was forced to flee the building immediately. This is also featured in the American TV series &quot;True Blood&quot;, where Sookie withdraws her invitation on a number of occasions, causing vampires to be thrown out by supernatural forces. Also, in &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; when a newly turned vampire wakes up in a house that he was not invited into, he immediately flees.

Some tales maintain that vampires must return to a coffin or to their &quot;native soil&quot; before sunrise to take their rest safely. Others place native soil in their coffins, especially if they have relocated. Still other vampire stories, such as Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Carmilla&quot;, maintain that vampires must return to their coffins, but sleep in several inches of blood as opposed to soil. Vampires are generally held to be unable to bear children, though the concept of a &quot;half vampire&quot; and similar creatures does exist in folklore and in some modern fiction. Some fictional vampires are fascinated with counting, an idea derived from folk stories about vampires being compelled to stop and count any spilled grain that they find in their path. The most famous fictional counting vampire is likely the Muppet character Count von Count on television&#x27;s &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Other examples include a fifth season episode of the &quot;X-Files&quot; titled &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, and the Discworld novel, &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; by Terry Pratchett. Some modern fictional vampires are portrayed as having magical powers beyond those originally assigned by myth, typically also possessing the powers of a witch or seer. Such examples include Drusilla from &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (Drusilla was a seer before she was a vampire, and carried those powers into her undeath), and Olivia Nightshade from &quot;The Nightshade Chronicles&quot;. Also, vampires from the &quot;Vampire Academy&quot; books, also known as the moroi, are skilled in elemental magic. Also, in the &quot;Twilight&quot; series, certain vampires appear to have special gifts like Edward (telepathy), Alice (visions), Bella (shielding), that are either supernatural or evolved from their own personalities like Victoria (survival instinct).

The dhampir, the offspring of a vampire and a human known from Serbian folklore, has been popularized in recent fiction.

<text>The International Polar Years (IPY) are collaborative, international efforts with intensive research focus on the polar regions. Karl Weyprecht, an Austro-Hungarian naval officer, motivated the endeavor in 1875, but died before it first occurred in 1882–1883. Fifty years later (1932–1933) a second IPY took place. The International Geophysical Year was inspired by the IPY and was organized 75 years after the first IPY (1957–58). The fourth, and most recent, IPY covered two full annual cycles from March 2007 to March 2009.

==The First International Polar Year (1882–1883)==

The First International Polar Year was proposed by an Austro-Hungarian naval officer, Karl Weyprecht, in 1875 and organized by Georg Neumayer, director of the German Maritime Observatory. Rather than settling for traditional individual and national efforts, they pushed for a coordinated scientific approach to researching Arctic phenomena. Observers made coordinated geophysical measurements at multiple locations in the Arctic during the same year enabling multiple views of the same phenomena, allowing broader interpretation of the available data and validation of the results obtained.

It took seven years to organize the first IPY which had eleven participating nations: the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States.

The aforementioned countries operated 12 stations in the Arctic and two in the sub-Antarctic. Six additional meteorological stations were organized by Neumayer at Moravian mission stations on the east coast of Labrador. Observations focused on meteorology, geomagnetism, auroral phenomena, ocean currents, tides, structure, and the motion of ice and atmospheric electricity. More than 40 meteorological observatories around the world expanded the IPY programs of observations for this period. Data and images from the first IPY have recently been made available to browse and download on the internet. These records of the first IPY offer a rare glimpse of the circumpolar Arctic environment as it existed in the past and hold the potential to improve our understanding of historical climate variability and environmental change in the Arctic.

==The Second International Polar Year (1932–1933)==

The International Meteorological Organization, the predecessor of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), proposed and promoted the second IPY (1932–1933). Shortly after World War I, mysterious behavior in telegraph, radio and electric power and telephone lines convinced engineers and scientists of the fact that the electrical geophysics of the Earth needed more study. The availability of airplanes, motorized sea and land transport and new instruments like radiosondes enabled these phenomena to be investigated.

At an international conference of directors of meteorological services in Copenhagen in 1928 it was decided to undertake another intensive and coordinated international research effort focused on the polar regions during 1932–1933, the 50th anniversary of the First International Polar Year. It was also proposed to explicitly include in the plan for the second IPY the goal to investigate how observations in the polar regions could improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and the safety of air and sea transport.

Forty-four countries participated in the second IPY, which heralded advances in meteorology, magnetism, atmospheric science, and in the &quot;mapping&quot; of ionospheric phenomena that advanced radio science and technology. 27 observation stations were established in the Arctic, a vast amount of data was collected and a world data center was created under the organization that eventually came to be called the World Meteorological Organization. Due to the Great Depression, the plan of erecting a network of stations in Antarctica had to be abandoned. Also, a great amount of data generated in this year was lost due to Second World War.

==International Geophysical Year (1957–58) (Also referred to as the Third IPY)==
See International Geophysical Year

==The Fourth International Polar Year (2007–2008)==
The fourth IPY (2007–2008) was sponsored by the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), an interdisciplinary body of ICSU assumed responsibility for coordinating all IPY-related Antarctic research, and the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC), an ICSU affiliate body, promoted and helped to plan the Arctic-focused IPY research. Initial planning for the fourth IPY began in 2003 under an International Planning Group (chaired by Professor Chris Rapley and Dr Robin Bell), and the organization and implementation of the main phase of this IPY took place in 2005–2009 with leadership from the newly established ICSU-WMO Joint Committee (co-chaired by Dr Michel Béland and Dr Ian Allison, who was later replaced as co-chair by Prof. Jerónimo López-Martínez), its subcommittees and the International Programme Office (led by Dr David Carlson).

The fourth IPY comprised an intense, coordinated field campaign of observations, research, and analysis. It was the largest, most comprehensive campaign ever mounted to explore the Earth&#x27;s polar regions. An estimated 50,000 researchers, local observers, educators, students and support personnel from more than 60 countries were involved in the 228 international IPY projects (170 in scientific research, one in data management, and 57 in education and outreach) and related national efforts. The IPY included intensive research and observation periods in the Arctic and Antarctic over a three-year timespan, which started 1 March 2007 and was formally concluded 12 June 2010 at the IPY Oslo Science Conference. However, many activities continued beyond that date. The IPY Science Program covered eleven areas: Polar atmosphere, Arctic ocean, Southern Ocean, Greenland ice sheet and Arctic glaciers, Antarctic ice sheets, Subglacial aquatic environments, Permafrost, Earth structure and geodynamics at the poles, Polar terrestrial ecology and biodiversity, Polar societies and social processes and Human health.

===IPY Report===
In 2011 the ICSU/WMO Joint Committee for the IPY published a comprehensive summary of IPY activities entitled &quot;Understanding Earth&#x27;s Polar Challenges: International Polar Year 2007–2008&quot;.
The report covers the development of IPY 2007–2008 for almost a decade, from 2001 to 2010. It comprises 38 chapters in five parts (Planning, Research, Observations, Outreach, and Legacies) and brings together hundreds of contributing authors from a wide range disciplines and more than 30 countries. This broad overview demonstrates the extensive and essential contribution made by participating nations and organizations, and provides a prospective blueprint for future polar research.

===SCAR/IASC Open Science Conference, St. Petersburg, Russia, 2008===
A joint conference organized by SCAR and IASC under the overarching theme “Polar Research – Arctic and Antarctic perspectives in the International Polar Year” was held 8–11 July 2008 in St. Petersburg, Russia, and brought together Arctic and Antarctic researchers as part of the fourth IPY. The four-day meeting comprised 29 sessions with over 1400 attendees, 550 oral presentations and 670 posters.

===IPY Science Conferences===
====Oslo, Norway 2010====
The IPY Science Conference was held 8–12 June in Oslo, Norway and was organized by the WMO, ICSU, IASC and the Research Council of Norway and marked the official end of the fourth IPY.
The conference aim was to celebrate and publish early results from the International Polar Year 2007–2008 (IPY) and enable direct interaction among all IPY science cluster projects. There were over 2000 participants from over 60 countries.
====Montréal, Canada, 2012====
Building on the previous IPY Science Conference in Oslo, the IPY steering committee organized a science conference (22–27 April 2012) in Montréal, Canada, with the theme ‘From knowledge to action’. This conference examined the global impact and implications of International Polar Year activities. The aim of the IPY Science Conference in 2012 was to help shape stewardship, sustainable development and environmental protection goals for the strategic and highly valued polar regions. In total the IPY 2012 conference received 2134 abstracts with contributions from over 45 countries.

===Polar Educators International===
An important legacy of the IPY 2012 &quot;From Knowledge to Action&quot; Conference Polar Educators Workshop, together with the education and outreach efforts of the International Polar Year 2007 – 2008, was the establishment of Polar Educators International (PEI), a vibrant network promoting polar education and research to a global community. This includes a formal network of professionals involved in science education focused on promoting excellence in teaching polar science. Louise Huffman, co-chair of the IPY Education and Outreach Committee was one of the founding members.

===The Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS)===
The Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) was founded during the fourth IPY.

Following a meeting in Stockholm at the end of September 2007, the IPY International Youth Steering Committee (IYSC) and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) merged under a new structure while maintaining the name ‘APECS’. The IPY International Youth Steering Committee (IYSC) had been established in 2004 by Amber Church, Tyler Kuhn, Melanie Raymond and Hugues Lantuit to represent the needs of the youth during the fourth IPY, and the Association of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) had been established in 2006 to represent the needs and challenges faced by (post-)graduate students, post-docs, junior faculty, and research associates involved in polar research.

APECS aims to stimulate interdisciplinary and international research collaborations, provide opportunities for professional career development and develop effective future leaders in polar research, education and outreach. Jenny Baeseman, as the Founding Director of APECS, established the organisations first international secretariat in Tromsø, Norway during the IPY.

===International Polar Weeks===
To provide a platform for a continued focus on the polar regions, the IPY International Programme Office organised Polar Weeks with the theme &quot;What Happens at the Poles Affects Us All&quot; in October 2009 and March 2010.

Twice yearly polar weeks continue to this day and are organized by APECS. These weeks, coinciding with the polar equinoxes, are filled with outreach activities and events designed to engage school children and the wider public in polar science.

==A Planned Fifth International Polar Year (2032–2033)==
Planning has begun for a fifth International Polar Year in 2032/33 following an agreement between the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).

==International Polar Year Publications Database==
The International Polar Year Publications Database (IPYPD) attempts to identify and describe all publications that result from, or are about, any of the four IPYs that have been undertaken so far. The IPYPD is part of the IPY Data and Information Service (IPYDIS). The IPYPD has been created by the Arctic Science and Technology Information System (ASTIS), the Cold Regions Bibliography Project (CRBP), the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) Library, the Discovery and Access of Historic Literature of the IPYs (DAHLI) project and NISC Export Services (NES).
As of February 2016, the database contains 6,724 records.

<doc id="78209" wikidata="Q169234" url="?curid=78209" title="Abu Bakr al-Razi">
<text>Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (full name: ), , often known as (al-)Razi or by his Latin name Rhazes, also rendered Rhasis, was a Persian physician, philosopher and alchemist who lived during the Islamic Golden Age. He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of medicine, and also wrote on logic, astronomy and grammar. He is also known for his criticism of religion, especially with regard to the concepts of prophethood and revelation. However, the religio-philosophical aspects of his thought, which also included a belief in five &quot;eternal principles&quot;, are fragmentary and only reported by authors who were often hostile to him.

A comprehensive thinker, al-Razi made fundamental and enduring contributions to various fields, which he recorded in over 200 manuscripts, and is particularly remembered for numerous advances in medicine through his observations and discoveries. An early proponent of experimental medicine, he became a successful doctor, and served as chief physician of Baghdad and Ray hospitals. As a teacher of medicine, he attracted students of all backgrounds and interests and was said to be compassionate and devoted to the service of his patients, whether rich or poor. Along with Thabit ibn Qurra (836–901), he was one of the first to clinically distinguish between smallpox and measles.

Through translation, his medical works and ideas became known among medieval European practitioners and profoundly influenced medical education in the Latin West. Some volumes of his work &quot;Al-Mansuri&quot;, namely &quot;On Surgery&quot; and &quot;A General Book on Therapy&quot;, became part of the medical curriculum in Western universities. Edward Granville Browne considers him as &quot;probably the greatest and most original of all the Muslim physicians, and one of the most prolific as an author&quot;. Additionally, he has been described as the father of pediatrics, and a pioneer of obstetrics and ophthalmology.

==Biography==

Al-Razi was born in the city of Ray (modern Rey, also the origin of his name &quot;al-Razi&quot;), into a family of Persian stock and was a native speaker of Persian language. Ray was situated on the Great Silk Road that for centuries facilitated trade and cultural exchanges between East and West. It is located on the southern slopes of the Alborz mountain range situated near Tehran, Iran.

In his youth, al-Razi moved to Baghdad where he studied and practiced at the local bimaristan (hospital). Later, he was invited back to Rey by Mansur ibn Ishaq, then the governor of Ray, and became a bimaristan&#x27;s head. He dedicated two books on medicine to Mansur ibn Ishaq, &quot;The Spiritual Physic&quot; and &quot;Al-Mansūrī on Medicine&quot;. Because of his newly acquired popularity as physician, al-Razi was invited to Baghdad where he assumed the responsibilities of a director in a new hospital named after its founder al-Muʿtaḍid (d. 902 CE). Under the reign of Al-Mutadid&#x27;s son, Al-Muktafi (r. 902–908) al-Razi was commissioned to build a new hospital, which should be the largest of the Abbasid Caliphate. To pick the future hospital&#x27;s location, al-Razi adopted what is nowadays known as an evidence-based approach suggesting having fresh meat hung in various places throughout the city and to build the hospital where meat took longest to rot.

He spent the last years of his life in his native Rey suffering from glaucoma. His eye affliction started with cataracts and ended in total blindness. The cause of his blindness is uncertain. One account mentioned by Ibn Juljul attributed the cause to a blow to his head by his patron, Mansur ibn Ishaq, for failing to provide proof for his alchemy theories; while Abulfaraj and Casiri claimed that the cause was a diet of beans only. Allegedly, he was approached by a physician offering an ointment to cure his blindness. Al-Razi then asked him how many layers does the eye contain and when he was unable to receive an answer, he declined the treatment stating &quot;my eyes will not be treated by one who does not know the basics of its anatomy&quot;.

The lectures of al-Razi attracted many students. As Ibn al-Nadim relates in &quot;Fihrist&quot;, al-Razi was considered a &quot;shaikh&quot;, an honorary title given to one entitled to teach and surrounded by several circles of students. When someone raised a question, it was passed on to students of the &#x27;first circle&#x27;; if they did not know the answer, it was passed on to those of the &#x27;second circle&#x27;, and so on. When all students would fail to answer, al-Razi himself would consider the query. Al-Razi was a generous person by nature, with a considerate attitude towards his patients. He was charitable to the poor, treated them without payment in any form, and wrote for them a treatise &quot;Man La Yaḥḍuruhu al-Ṭabīb&quot;, or &quot;Who Has No Physician to Attend Him&quot;, with medical advice. One former pupil from Tabaristan came to look after him, but as al-Biruni wrote, al-Razi rewarded him for his intentions and sent him back home, proclaiming that his final days were approaching. According to Biruni, al-Razi died in Rey in 925 sixty years of age. Biruni, who considered al-Razi his mentor, among the first penned a short biography of al-Razi including a bibliography of his numerous works.

Ibn al-Nadim recorded an account by al-Razi of a Chinese student who copied down all of Galen&#x27;s works in Chinese as al-Razi read them to him out loud after the student learned fluent Arabic in 5 months and attended al-Razi&#x27;s lectures.

After his death, his fame spread beyond the Middle East to Medieval Europe, and lived on. In an undated catalog of the library at Peterborough Abbey, most likely from the 14th century, al-Razi is listed as a part author of ten books on medicine.

==Contributions to medicine==

===Psychology and psychotherapy===
Al-Razi was one of the world&#x27;s first great medical experts. He is considered the father of psychology and psychotherapy.

===Smallpox vs. measles===

Al-Razi&#x27;s book (&quot;On Smallpox and Measles&quot;) is, along with a book of the same name by Thabit ibn Qurra (836–901), among the earliest extant books describing smallpox and measles as distinct diseases. Smallpox was not known in ancient Greek medicine, but was likely differentiated from measles and other similar diseases by late Byzantine/Sassanid-era authors writing in Greek and Syriac, whose works were known to Thabit and al-Razi.

Al-Razi&#x27;s work was translated into Syriac, then into Greek. It became known in Europe through this Greek translation, as well as Latin translations based on the Greek text, and was later translated into several European languages. Neither the date nor the author of the Syriac and Greek versions is known; but the Greek was created at the request of one of the Byzantine emperors.

=== Meningitis ===
Al-Razi compared the outcome of patients with meningitis treated with blood-letting with the outcome of those treated without it to see if blood-letting could help.

===Pharmacy===
Al-Razi contributed in many ways to the early practice of pharmacy by compiling texts, in which he introduces the use of &quot;mercurial ointments&quot; and his development of apparatus such as mortars, flasks, spatulas and phials, which were used in pharmacies until the early twentieth century.

===Ethics of medicine===
On a professional level, al-Razi introduced many practical, progressive, medical and psychological ideas. He attacked charlatans and fake doctors who roamed the cities and countryside selling their nostrums and &quot;cures&quot;. At the same time, he warned that even highly educated doctors did not have the answers to all medical problems and could not cure all sicknesses or heal every disease, which was humanly speaking impossible. To become more useful in their services and truer to their calling, al-Razi advised practitioners to keep up with advanced knowledge by continually studying medical books and exposing themselves to new information. He made a distinction between curable and incurable diseases. Pertaining to the latter, he commented that in the case of advanced cases of cancer and leprosy the physician should not be blamed when he could not cure them. To add a humorous note, al-Razi felt great pity for physicians who took care for the well being of princes, nobility, and women, because they did not obey the doctor&#x27;s orders to restrict their diet or get medical treatment, thus making it most difficult being their physician.

He also wrote the following on medical ethics:


===Books and articles on medicine===
;&quot;al-Kitab al-Hawi&quot;
This 23-volume set medical textbooks contains the foundation of gynaecology, obstetrics and ophthalmic surgery.

;&quot;The Virtuous Life&quot; (&quot;al-Hawi&quot; &quot;الحاوي&quot;).

This monumental medical encyclopedia in nine volumes—known in Europe also as &quot;The Large Comprehensive&quot; or &quot;Continens Liber&quot; (&quot;جامع الكبير&quot;)—contains considerations and criticism on the Greek philosophers Aristotle and Plato, and expresses innovative views on many subjects. Because of this book alone, many scholars consider al-Razi the greatest medical doctor of the Middle Ages.

The &quot;al-Hawi&quot; is not a formal medical encyclopedia, but a posthumous compilation of al-Razi&#x27;s working notebooks, which included knowledge gathered from other books as well as original observations on diseases and therapies, based on his own clinical experience. It is significant since it contains a monograph on smallpox, one of the earliest known. It was translated into Latin in 1279 by Faraj ben Salim, a physician of Sicilian-Jewish origin employed by Charles of Anjou, and after which it had a considerable influence in Europe.

The &quot;al-Hawi&quot; also criticized the views of Galen, after al-Razi had observed many clinical cases which did not follow Galen&#x27;s descriptions of fevers. For example, he stated that Galen&#x27;s descriptions of urinary ailments were inaccurate as he had only seen three cases, while al-Razi had studied hundreds of such cases in hospitals of Baghdad and Rey.

;&quot;For One Who Has No Physician to Attend Him&quot; (&quot;Man la Yahduruhu Al-Tabib&quot;) (&quot;من لا يحضره الطبيب&quot;)—A medical adviser for the general public

Al-Razi was possibly the first Persian doctor to deliberately write a home medical manual (remedial) directed at the general public. He dedicated it to the poor, the traveller, and the ordinary citizen who could consult it for treatment of common ailments when a doctor was not available. This book is of special interest to the history of pharmacy since similar books were very popular until the 20th century. Al-Razi described in its 36 chapters, diets and drug components that can be found in either an apothecary, a market place, in well-equipped kitchens, or and in military camps. Thus, every intelligent person could follow its instructions and prepare the proper recipes with good results.

Some of the illnesses treated were headaches, colds, coughing, melancholy and diseases of the eye, ear, and stomach. For example, he prescribed for a feverish headache: &quot; 2 parts of &quot;duhn&quot; (oily extract) of rose, to be mixed with 1 part of vinegar, in which a piece of linen cloth is dipped and compressed on the forehead&quot;. He recommended as a laxative, &quot; 7 drams of dried violet flowers with 20 pears, macerated and well mixed, then strained. Add to this filtrate, 20 drams of sugar for a drink. In cases of melancholy, he invariably recommended prescriptions, which included either poppies or its juice (opium), &quot;Cuscuta epithymum&quot; (clover dodder) or both. For an eye-remedy, he advised myrrh, saffron, and frankincense, 2 drams each, to be mixed with 1 dram of yellow arsenic formed into tablets. Each tablet was to be dissolved in a sufficient quantity of coriander water and used as eye drops.
;&quot;Book for al-Mansur ()&quot;
Al-Razi dedicated this work to his patron Abū Ṣāliḥ al-Manṣūr, the Samanid governor of Ray. It was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona around 1180. A Latin translation of it was edited in the 16th century by the Dutch anatomist and physician Andreas Vesalius.

;&quot;Doubts about Galen&quot; ()

In his book &quot;Doubts about Galen&quot;, al-Razi rejects several claims made by the Greek physician, as far as the alleged superiority of the Greek language and many of his cosmological and medical views. He links medicine with philosophy, and states that sound practice demands independent thinking. He reports that Galen&#x27;s descriptions do not agree with his own clinical observations regarding the run of a fever. And in some cases he finds that his clinical experience exceeds Galen&#x27;s.

He criticized Galen&#x27;s theory that the body possessed four separate &quot;humors&quot; (liquid substances), whose balance are the key to health and a natural body-temperature. A sure way to upset such a system was to insert a liquid with a different temperature into the body resulting in an increase or decrease of bodily heat, which resembled the temperature of that particular fluid. Al-Razi noted that a warm drink would heat up the body to a degree much higher than its own natural temperature. Thus the drink would trigger a response from the body, rather than transferring only its own warmth or coldness to it. (&quot;Cf.&quot; I. E. Goodman)

This line of criticism essentially had the potential to completely refute Galen&#x27;s theory of humors, as well as Aristotle&#x27;s theory of the four elements, on which it was grounded. Al-Razi&#x27;s own alchemical experiments suggested other qualities of matter, such as &quot;oiliness&quot; and &quot;sulphurousness&quot;, or inflammability and salinity, which were not readily explained by the traditional fire, water, earth, and air division of elements.

Al-Razi&#x27;s challenge to the current fundamentals of medical theory was quite controversial. Many accused him of ignorance and arrogance, even though he repeatedly expressed his praise and gratitude to Galen for his contributions and labours, saying:

I prayed to God to direct and lead me to the truth in writing this book. It grieves me to oppose and criticize the man Galen from whose sea of knowledge I have drawn much. Indeed, he is the Master and I am the disciple. Although this reverence and appreciation will and should not prevent me from doubting, as I did, what is erroneous in his theories. I imagine and feel deeply in my heart that Galen has chosen me to undertake this task, and if he were alive, he would have congratulated me on what I am doing. I say this because Galen&#x27;s aim was to seek and find the truth and bring light out of darkness. I wish indeed he were alive to read what I have published.

;&quot;The Diseases of Children&quot;

Al-Razi&#x27;s &quot;The Diseases of Children&quot; was the first monograph to deal with pediatrics as an independent field of medicine.

==Alchemy==


===The transmutation of metals===
Al-Razi&#x27;s interest in alchemy and his strong belief in the possibility of transmutation of lesser metals to silver and gold was attested half a century after his death by Ibn an-Nadim&#x27;s book, &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (&quot;Lapis Philosophorum&quot; in Latin). Nadim attributed a series of twelve books to al-Razi, plus an additional seven, including his refutation to al-Kindi&#x27;s denial of the validity of alchemy. Al-Kindi (801–873 CE) had been appointed by the Abbasid Caliph Ma&#x27;mun founder of Baghdad, to &#x27;the House of Wisdom&#x27; in that city, he was a philosopher and an opponent of alchemy. Al-Razi&#x27;s two best-known alchemical texts, which largely superseded his earlier ones: &quot;al-Asrar&quot; (الاسرار &quot;The Secrets&quot;), and &quot;Sirr al-Asrar&quot; (سر الاسرار &quot;The Secret of Secrets&quot;), which incorporates much of the previous work.

Apparently al-Razi&#x27;s contemporaries believed that he had obtained the secret of turning iron and copper into gold. Biographer Khosro Moetazed reports in &quot;Mohammad Zakaria Razi&quot; that a certain General Simjur confronted al-Razi in public, and asked whether that was the underlying reason for his willingness to treat patients without a fee. &quot;It appeared to those present that al-Razi was reluctant to answer; he looked sideways at the general and replied&quot;:I understand alchemy and I have been working on the characteristic properties of metals for an extended time. However, it still has not turned out to be evident to me, how one can transmute gold from copper. Despite the research from the ancient scientists done over the past centuries, there has been no answer. I very much doubt if it is possible...

===Major works on alchemy===

Al-Razi&#x27;s works present the first systematic classification of carefully observed and verified facts regarding chemical substances, reactions and apparatus, described in a language almost entirely free from mysticism and ambiguity.

==== &quot;The Secrets&quot; () ====

&quot;&#x27;The Secrets&#x27;&quot; (&quot;al-Asrar&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Asrār&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Book of Secrets&quot;&#x27;) was written in response to a request from al-Razi&#x27;s close friend, colleague, and former student, Abu Muhammad ibn Yunis al-Bukhari, a Muslim mathematician, philosopher, and natural scientist.

==== &quot;Secret of Secrets&quot; () ====
This is al-Razi&#x27;s most famous book. Here he gives systematic attention to basic chemical operations important to the history of pharmacy. In this book al-Razi divides the subject of &quot;matter&#x27; into three categories, as in his previous book .
# Knowledge and identification of the medical components within substances derived from plants, animals, and minerals, and descriptions of the best types for medical treatments.
# Knowledge of equipment and tools of interest to and used by either alchemists or apothecaries.
# Knowledge of seven alchemical procedures and techniques: sublimation and condensation of mercury, precipitation of sulfur, and arsenic calcination of minerals (gold, silver, copper, lead, and iron), salts, glass, talc, shells, and waxing.

: This last category contains additional descriptions of other methods and applications used in transmutation:
:* The added mixture and use of solvent vehicles.
:* The amount of heat (fire) used, &#x27;bodies and stones&#x27;, ( and ) that can or cannot be transmuted into corporal substances such of metals and salts ().
:* The use of a liquid mordant which quickly and permanently colors lesser metals for more lucrative sale and profit.

Similar to the commentary on the 8th century text on amalgams ascribed to Jabir ibn Hayyan, al-Razi gives methods and procedures of coloring a silver object to imitate gold (gold leafing) and the reverse technique of removing its color back to silver. Gilding and silvering of other metals (alum, calcium salts, iron, copper, and tutty) are also described, as well as how colors will last for years without tarnishing or changing.

Al-Razi classified minerals into six divisions:
# Four spirits (): mercury, sal ammoniac, sulphur, and arsenic sulphide (orpiment and realgar).
# Seven bodies (): silver, gold, copper, iron, black lead (), zinc (), and tin.
# Thirteen stones (): Marcasite (), magnesia, malachite, tutty (, zinc oxide), talcum, lapis lazuli, gypsum, azurite, haematite (iron oxide), arsenic oxide, mica, asbestos, and glass (then identified as made of sand and alkali of which the transparent crystal damascene is considered the best).
# Seven vitriols (): alum ( ), and white ( ), black, red ( ), and yellow ( ) vitriols (the impure sulfates of iron, copper, etc.), green ( ).
# Seven borates: natron, and impure sodium borate.
# Eleven salts (): including brine, common salt, ashes, naphtha, live lime, and urine, rock, and sea salts. Then he separately defines and describes each of these substances, the best forms and colours of each, and the qualities of various adulterations.

Al-Razi gives also a list of apparatus used in alchemy. This consists of 2 classes:
# Instruments used for the dissolving and melting of metals such as the blacksmith&#x27;s hearth, bellows, crucible, thongs (tongue or ladle), , stirring rod, cutter, grinder (pestle), file, shears, , and semi-cylindrical iron mould.
# Utensils used to carry out the process of transmutation and various parts of the distilling apparatus: the retort, alembic, shallow iron pan, potters kiln and blowers, large oven, cylindrical stove, glass cups, flasks, phials, beakers, glass funnel, crucible, aludel, heating lamps, mortar, cauldron, hair-cloth, sand- and water-bath, sieve, flat stone mortar and chafing-dish.

==Philosophy==
Although al-Razi wrote extensively on philosophy, most of his works on this subject are now lost. Most of his religio-philosophical ideas, including his belief in five &quot;eternal principles&quot;, are only known from fragments and testimonies found in other authors, who were often strongly opposed to his thought.

===Metaphysics===
Al-Razi&#x27;s metaphysical doctrine derives from the theory of the &quot;five eternals&quot;, according to which the world is produced out of an interaction between God and four other eternal principles (soul, matter, time, and place). He accepted a pre-socratic type of atomism of the bodies, and for that he differed from both the falasifa and the mutakallimun. While he was influenced by Plato and the medical writers, mainly Galen, he rejected taqlid and thus expressed criticism about some of their views. This is evident from the title of one of his works, &quot;Doubts About Galen&quot;.
==Views on religion==
A number of contradictory works and statements about religion have been ascribed to al-Razi. Many sources claim that al-Razi viewed prophecy and revealed religion as unnecessary and delusional, claiming that all humans have the ability to access and discover truth (including the existence of God) through God-given reason. According to these sources, his skepticism of prophecy and view that no one group or religion has privileged access to the truth is driven by his view that all people have an equal basic capacity for rationality and discovery of truth, and that apparent differences in this capacity are simply a feature of interest, opportunity, and effort. Because of his supposed rejection of prophecy and acceptance of reason as the primary method for accessing the truth, al-Razi came to be admired as a freethinker by some.

According to al-Biruni&#x27;s &quot;Bibliography of al-Razi&quot; (&quot;Risāla fī Fihrist Kutub al-Rāzī&quot;), al-Razi wrote two &quot;heretical books&quot;: &quot;&quot;Fī al-Nubuwwāt&quot; (&quot;On Prophecies&quot;) and &quot;&quot;Fī Ḥiyal al-Mutanabbīn&quot; (&quot;On the Tricks of False Prophets&quot;). According to Biruni, the first &quot;was claimed to be against religions&quot; and the second &quot;was claimed as attacking the necessity of the prophets.&quot; However, Biruni also listed some other works of al-Razi on religion, including &quot;Fi Wujub Da‘wat al-Nabi ‘Ala Man Nakara bi al-Nubuwwat&quot; (&quot;Obligation to Propagate the Teachings of the Prophet Against Those who Denied Prophecies&quot;) and &quot;Fi anna li al-Insan Khaliqan Mutqinan Hakiman&quot; (&quot;That Man has a Wise and Perfect Creator&quot;), listed under his works on the &quot;divine sciences&quot;. None of his works on religion are now extant in full.

Sarah Stroumsa has argued that al-Razi was a freethinker who rejected all revealed religions. However, Peter Adamson, Marwan Rashed and others hold that al-Razi did not reject revealed religion, on the basis of more recent evidence found in the writings of the theologian and philosopher Fakhr al-Din al-Razi (died 1210). Adamson states:It is worth noting that Stroumsa’s work predates Rashed’s discovery of this evidence in Fakhr al-Dīn, so that she did not have the benefit of being able to consider how this new information could be reconciled with the Proofs. That is the goal I will set for myself in this chapter. I should lay my cards on the table and say that I am persuaded by Rashed’s account, and do not believe that Razi was staging a general attack on prophecy or religion as Abū Ḥātim would have us think.

=== Debate with Abu Hatim ===

The views and quotes that are often ascribed to al-Razi where he appears to be critical of religion are found in a book written by Abu Hatim al-Razi, called &quot;Aʿlām al-nubuwwa&quot; (Signs of Prophecy), which documents a debate between Abu Hatim and al-Razi. Abu Hatim was an Isma&#x27;ili missionary who debated al-Razi, but whether he has faithfully recorded the views of al-Razi is disputed. Some historians claim that Abu Hatim accurately represented al-Razi&#x27;s scepticism of revealed religion while others argue that Abu Hatim&#x27;s work should be treated with scepticism given that he is a hostile source of al-Razi&#x27;s beliefs and might have portrayed him as a heretic to discount his critique of the Ismāʿīlīs.

According to Abdul Latif al-&#x27;Abd, Islamic philosophy professor at Cairo University, Abu Hatim and his student, Ḥamīd al-dīn Karmānī (d. after 411AH/1020CE), were Isma&#x27;ili extremists who often misrepresented the views of al-Razi in their works. This view is also corroborated by early historians like al-Shahrastani who noted &quot;that such accusations should be doubted since they were made by Ismāʿīlīs, who had been severely attacked by Muḥammad ibn Zakariyyā Rāzī&quot;. Al-&#x27;Abd points out that the views allegedly expressed by al-Razi contradict what is found in al-Razi&#x27;s own works, like the &quot;Spiritual Medicine&quot; (&quot;Fī al-ṭibb al-rūḥānī&quot;). Peter Adamson concurs that Abu Hatim may have &quot;deliberately misdescribed&quot; al-Razi&#x27;s position as a rejection of Islam and revealed religions. Instead, al-Razi was only arguing against the use of miracles to prove Muhammad&#x27;s prophecy, anthropomorphism, and the uncritical acceptance of &quot;taqlīd&quot; vs &quot;naẓar&quot;. Adamson points out to a work by Fakhr al-din al-Razi where al-Razi is quoted as citing the Quran and the prophets to support his views.

In contrast, earlier historians such as Paul Kraus and Sarah Stroumsa accepted that the extracts found in Abu Hatim&#x27;s book were either said by al-Razi during a debate or were quoted from a now lost work. According to the debate with Abu Hatim, al-Razi denied the validity of prophecy or other authority figures, and rejected prophetic miracles. He also directed a scathing critique on revealed religions and the miraculous quality of the Quran. They suggest that this lost work is either his famous &quot;al-ʿIlm al-Ilāhī&quot; or another shorter independent work called &quot;Makharīq al-Anbiyāʾ&quot; (&quot;The Prophets&#x27; Fraudulent Tricks&quot;). Abu Hatim, however, did not explicitly mention al-Razi by name in his book, but referred to his interlocutor simply as the &quot;mulḥid&quot; (lit. &quot;heretic&quot;).

==Criticism==

Al-Razi&#x27;s religious and philosophical views were later criticized by Abu Rayhan Biruni and Avicenna in the early 11th century. Biruni in particular wrote a short treatise (&quot;risala&quot;) dealing with al-Razi, criticizing him for his sympathy with Manichaeism, his Hermetical writings, his religious and philosophical views, for refusing to mathematize physics, and his active opposition to mathematics. Avicenna, who was himself a physician and philosopher, also criticized al-Razi. During a debate with Biruni, Avicenna stated:

Nasr-i-Khosraw posthumously accused him of having plagiarized Iranshahri, whom Khosraw considered the master of al-Razi.

==Legacy==
The modern-day Razi Institute in Karaj and Razi University in Kermanshah were named after him. A &quot;Razi Day&quot; (&quot;Pharmacy Day&quot;) is commemorated in Iran every 27 August.

In June 2009, Iran donated a &quot;Scholars Pavilion&quot; or Chartagi to the United Nations Office in Vienna, now placed in the central Memorial Plaza of the Vienna International Center. The pavilion features the statues of al-Razi, Avicenna, Abu Rayhan Biruni, and Omar Khayyam.

George Sarton remarked him as &quot;greatest physician of Islam and the Medieval Ages&quot;.

<text>Lloyd Viel Berkner (February 1, 1905 – June 4, 1967) was an American physicist and engineer. He was one of the inventors of the measuring device that since has become standard at ionospheric stations because it measures the height and electron density of the ionosphere. The data obtained in the worldwide net of such instruments were important for the developing theory of short wave radio propagation to which Berkner himself gave important contributions.

Berkner was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1948.

Later he investigated the development of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Since he needed data from the whole world, he proposed the International Geophysical Year in 1950. At that time, the IGY was the largest cooperative study of the Earth ever undertaken.

Berkner was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1956. The IGY was carried out by the International Council of Scientific Unions while he was president in 1957–1959. He was also a member of the President&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Committee in 1958 while he was president of Associated Universities Inc.

In 1963, Berkner, with L.C. Marshall, advanced a theory to describe the way in which the atmospheres of the Solar System&#x27;s inner planets had evolved.

Beginning in 1926, as a naval officer, Berkner assisted in the development of radar and navigation systems, naval aircraft electronics engineering, and studies that led to the construction of the Distant Early Warning system, a chain of radar stations designed to give the United States advance warning in the event of a missile attack across the North Pole. In the 1950s and 1960s, Berkner held intelligence clearances in the Atomic Energy Commission and other agencies. He worked with the CIA in some capacity as well, but any activities are wholly classified as of 2015.

Berkner worked with Dallas community leaders to establish the Graduate Research Center of the Southwest (later renamed the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, which would eventually become The University of Texas at Dallas).

He wrote more than 100 papers and several books, including &quot;Rockets and Satellites&quot; (1958), &quot;Science in Space&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Scientific Age&quot; (1964).

In 1961, Berkner was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers.

== Legacy ==
Lloyd V. Berkner High School in Richardson, Texas was named after him in 1969, as was Lloyd V. Berkner Hall at the University of Texas at Dallas. The lunar crater Berkner was named in his honor. Berkner Island in Antarctica was also named for Berkner because of his work as a radio operator on the first Byrd expedition to Antarctica in 1928.

Berkner was married to Lillian Fulks Berkner and had two children.

<doc id="78214" wikidata="Q4572" url="?curid=78214" title="Permaculture">
<text>Permaculture is an approach to land management and settlement design that adopts arrangements observed in flourishing natural ecosystems. It includes a set of design principles derived using whole-systems thinking. It applies these principles in fields such as regenerative agriculture, town planning, rewilding, and community resilience. The term was coined in 1978 by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren, who formulated the concept in opposition to modern industrialized methods, instead adopting a more traditional or &quot;natural&quot; approach to agriculture.

Multiple thinkers in the early and mid-20th century explored no-dig gardening, no-till farming, and the concept of &quot;permanent agriculture&quot;, which were early inspirations for the field of permaculture. Mollison and Holmgren&#x27;s work from the 1970s and 1980s led to several books, starting with &quot;Permaculture One&quot; in 1978, and to the development of the &quot;Permaculture Design Course&quot; which has been one of the main methods of diffusion of permacultural ideas. Starting from a focus on land usage in Southern Australia, permaculture has since spread in scope to include other regions and other topics, such as appropriate technology and intentional community design.

Several concepts and practices unify the wide array of approaches labelled as permaculture. Mollison and Holmgren&#x27;s three foundational ethics and Holmgren&#x27;s twelve design principles are often cited and restated in permaculture literature. Practices such as companion planting, extensive use of perennial crops, and designs such as the herb spiral have been used extensively by permaculturists.

Permaculture as a popular movement has been largely isolated from scientific literature, and has been criticised for a lack of clear definition or rigorous methodology. Despite a long divide, some 21st century studies have supported the claims that permaculture improves soil quality and biodiversity, and have identified it as a social movement capable of promoting agroecological transition away from conventional agriculture.

== Background ==

=== History ===

In 1911, Franklin Hiram King wrote &quot;Farmers of Forty Centuries: Or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan&quot;, describing farming practices of East Asia designed for &quot;permanent agriculture&quot;. In 1929, Joseph Russell Smith appended King&#x27;s term as the subtitle for &quot;Tree Crops: A Permanent Agriculture&quot;, which he wrote in response to widespread deforestation, plow agriculture, and erosion in the eastern mountains and hill regions of the United States. He proposed the planting of tree fruits and nuts as human and animal food crops that could stabilize watersheds and restore soil health. Smith saw the world as an inter-related whole and suggested mixed systems of trees with understory crops. This book inspired individuals such as Toyohiko Kagawa who pioneered forest farming in Japan in the 1930s. Another pioneer, George Washington Carver, advocated for practices now common in permaculture, including the use of crop rotation to restore nitrogen to the soil and repair damaged farmland, in his work at the Tuskegee Institute between 1896 and his death in 1947.

In his 1964 book &quot;Water for Every Farm&quot;, the Australian agronomist and engineer P. A. Yeomans advanced a definition of permanent agriculture as one that can be sustained indefinitely. Yeomans introduced both an observation-based approach to land use in Australia in the 1940s and in the 1950s the Keyline Design as a way of managing the supply and distribution of water in semi-arid regions. Other early influences include Stewart Brand&#x27;s works, Ruth Stout and Esther Deans, who pioneered no-dig gardening, and Masanobu Fukuoka who, in the late 1930s in Japan, began advocating no-till orchards and gardens and natural farming.

In the late 1960s, Bill Mollison, senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, and David Holmgren, graduate student at the then Tasmanian College of Advanced Education started developing ideas about stable agricultural systems on the southern Australian island of Tasmania. Their recognition of the unsustainable nature of modern industrialized methods and their inspiration from Tasmanian Aboriginal and other traditional practises were critical to their formulation of permaculture. In their view, industrialized methods were highly dependent on non-renewable resources, and were additionally poisoning land and water, reducing biodiversity, and removing billions of tons of topsoil from previously fertile landscapes. They responded with permaculture. This term was first made public with the publication of their 1978 book &quot;Permaculture One&quot;.

Following the publication of &quot;Permaculture One&quot;, Mollison responded to widespread enthusiasm for the work by traveling and teaching a three-week program that became known as the Permaculture Design Course. It addressed the application of permaculture design to growing in major climatic and soil conditions, to the use of renewable energy and natural building methods, and to &quot;invisible structures&quot; of human society. He found ready audiences in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, Britain, and Europe, and from 1985 also reached the Indian subcontinent and southern Africa. By the early 1980s, the concept had broadened from agricultural systems towards sustainable human habitats and at the 1st Intl. Permaculture Convergence, a gathering of graduates of the PDC held in Australia, the curriculum was formalized and its format shortened to two weeks. After &quot;Permaculture One&quot;, Mollison further refined and developed the ideas while designing hundreds of properties. This led to the 1988 publication of his global reference work, &quot;Permaculture: A Designers Manual&quot;. Mollison encouraged graduates to become teachers and set up their own institutes and demonstration sites. Critics suggest that this success weakened permaculture&#x27;s social aspirations of moving away from industrial social forms. They argue that the self-help model (akin to franchising) has had the effect of creating market-focused social relationships that the originators initially opposed.

=== Foundational ethics ===

The ethics on which permaculture builds are:

# &quot;Care of the Earth: Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply&quot;.
# &quot;Care of people: Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence&quot;.
# &quot;Setting limits to population and consumption: By governing our own needs, we can set resources aside to further the above principles&quot;.

Mollison&#x27;s 1988 formulation of the third ethic was restated by Holmgren in 2002 as &quot;Set limits to consumption and reproduction, and redistribute surplus&quot; and is elsewhere condensed to &quot;share the surplus&quot;.

Permaculture emphasizes patterns of landscape, function, and species assemblies. It determines where these elements should be placed so they can provide maximum benefit to the local environment. Permaculture maximizes synergy of the final design. The focus of permaculture, therefore, is not on individual elements, but rather on the relationships among them. The aim is for the whole to become greater than the sum of its parts, minimizing waste, human labour, and energy input, and to and maximize benefits through synergy.

Permaculture design is founded in replicating or imitating natural patterns found in ecosystems because these solutions have emerged through evolution over thousands of years and have proven to be effective. As a result, the implementation of permaculture design will vary widely depending on the region of the Earth it is located in. Because permaculture&#x27;s implementation is so localized and place specific, scientific literature for the field is lacking or not always applicable. Design principles derive from the science of systems ecology and the study of pre-industrial examples of sustainable land use.

A core theme of permaculture is the idea of &quot;people care&quot;. Seeking prosperity begins within a local community or culture that can apply the tenets of permaculture to sustain an environment that supports them and vice versa. This is in contrast to typical modern industrialized societies, where locality and generational knowledge is often overlooked in the pursuit of wealth or other forms of societal leverage.

== Theory ==

=== Design principles ===

Holmgren articulated twelve permaculture design principles in his &quot;Permaculture: Principles and Pathways Beyond Sustainability&quot;:

* &quot;Observe and interact&quot;: Take time to engage with nature to design solutions that suit a particular situation.
* &quot;Catch and store energy&quot;: Develop systems that collect resources at peak abundance for use in times of need.
* &quot;Obtain a yield&quot;: Emphasize projects that generate meaningful rewards.
* &quot;Apply self-regulation and accept feedback&quot;: Discourage inappropriate activity to ensure that systems function well.
* &quot;Use and value renewable resources and services&quot;: Make the best use of nature&#x27;s abundance: reduce consumption and dependence on non-renewable resources.
* &quot;Produce no waste&quot;: Value and employ all available resources: waste nothing.
* &quot;Design from patterns to details&quot;: Observe patterns in nature and society and use them to inform designs, later adding details.
* &quot;Integrate rather than segregate&quot;: Proper designs allow relationships to develop between design elements, allowing them to work together to support each other.
* &quot;Use small and slow solutions&quot;: Small and slow systems are easier to maintain, make better use of local resources, and produce more sustainable outcomes.
* &quot;Use and value diversity&quot;: Diversity reduces system-level vulnerability to threats and fully exploits its environment.
* &quot;Use edges and value the marginal&quot;: The border between things is where the most interesting events take place. These are often the system&#x27;s most valuable, diverse, and productive elements.
* &quot;Creatively use and respond to change&quot;: A positive impact on inevitable change comes from careful observation, followed by well-timed intervention.

=== Guilds ===

A guild is a mutually beneficial group of species that form a part of the larger ecosystem. Within a guild each species of insect or plant provides a unique set of diverse services that work in harmony. Plants may be grown for food production, drawing nutrients from deep in the soil through tap roots, balancing nitrogen levels in the soil (legumes), for attracting beneficial insects to the garden, and repelling undesirable insects or pests. There are several types of guilds, such as community function guilds, mutual support guilds, and resource partitioning guilds.

* Community function guilds group species based on a specific function or niche that they fill in the garden. Examples of this type of guild include plants that attract a particular beneficial insect or plants that restore nitrogen to the soil. These types of guilds are aimed at solving specific problems which may arise in a garden, such as infestations of harmful insects and poor nutrition in the soil.
* Establishment guilds are commonly used when working to establish target species (the primary vegetables, fruits, herbs, etc. you want to be established in your garden) with the support of pioneer species (plants that will help the target species succeed). For example, in temperate climates, plants such as comfrey (as a weed barrier and dynamic accumulator), lupine (as a nitrogen fixer), and daffodil (as a gopher deterrent) can together form a guild for a fruit tree. As the tree matures, the support plants will likely eventually be shaded out and can be used as compost.
* Mature guilds form once your target species are established. For example, if the tree layer of your landscape closes its canopy, sun-loving support plants will be shaded out and die. Shade loving medicinal herbs such as ginseng, Black Cohosh, and goldenseal can be planted as an understory.
* Mutual support guilds group species together that are complementary by working together and supporting each other. This guild may include a plant that fixes nitrogen, a plant that hosts insects that are predators to pests, and another plant that attracts pollinators. 
* Resource partitioning guilds group species based on their abilities to share essential resources with one another through a process of niche differentiation. An example of this type of guild includes placing a fibrous- or shallow-rooted plant next to a tap-rooted plant so that they draw from different levels of soil nutrients.

=== Zones ===

Zones intelligently organize design elements in a human environment based on the frequency of human use and plant or animal needs. Frequently manipulated or harvested elements of the design are located close to the house in zones 1 and 2. Manipulated elements located further away are used less frequently. Zones are numbered from 0 to 5 based on positioning.
; Zone 0
: The house, or home center. Here permaculture principles aim to reduce energy and water needs harnessing natural resources such as sunlight, to create a harmonious, sustainable environment in which to live and work. Zone 0 is an informal designation, not specifically defined in Mollison&#x27;s book.
; Zone 1
: The zone nearest to the house, the location for those elements in the system that require frequent attention, or that need to be visited often, such as salad crops, herb plants, soft fruit like strawberries or raspberries, greenhouse and cold frames, propagation area, worm compost bin for kitchen waste, etc. Raised beds are often used in Zone 1 in urban areas.
; Zone 2
: This area is used for siting perennial plants that require less frequent maintenance, such as occasional weed control or pruning, including currant bushes and orchards, pumpkins, sweet potato, etc. Also, a good place for beehives, larger-scale composting bins, etc.
; Zone 3
: The area where main crops are grown, both for domestic use and for trade purposes. After establishment, care and maintenance required are fairly minimal (provided mulches and similar things are used), such as watering or weed control maybe once a week.
; Zone 4
: A semi-wild area, mainly used for forage and collecting wild plants as well as production of timber for construction or firewood.
; Zone 5
: A wilderness area. Humans do not intervene in zone 5 apart from observing natural ecosystems and cycles. This zone hosts a natural reserve of bacteria, molds, and insects that can aid the zones above it.

=== Edge effect ===

The edge effect in ecology is the increased diversity that results when two habitats meet. Permaculturists argue that these places can be highly productive. An example of this is a coast. Where land and sea meet is a rich area that meets a disproportionate percentage of human and animal needs. This idea is reflected in permacultural designs by using spirals in herb gardens, or creating ponds that have wavy undulating shorelines rather than a simple circle or oval (thereby increasing the amount of edge for a given area). On the other hand, in a keyhole bed, edges are minimized to avoid wasting space and effort.

== Common practices ==

=== Hügelkultur ===

Hügelkultur is the practice of burying wood to increase soil water retention. The porous structure of wood acts like a sponge when decomposing underground. During the rainy season, sufficient buried wood can absorb enough water to sustain crops through the dry season. This technique is a traditional practice that has been developed over centuries in Europe and has been recently adopted by permaculturalists. The Hügelkultur technique can be implemented through building mounds on the ground as well as in raised garden beds. In raised beds, the practice &quot;imitates natural nutrient cycling found in wood decomposition and the high water-holding capacities of organic detritus, while also improving bed structure and drainage properties.&quot; This is done by placing wood material (e.g. logs and sticks) in the bottom of the bed before piling organic soil and compost on top. A study comparing the water retention capacities of Hügel raised beds to non-Hügel beds determined that Hügel beds are both lower maintenance and more efficient in the long term by requiring less irrigation.

=== Sheet mulching ===

Mulch is a protective cover placed over soil. Mulch material includes leaves, cardboard, and wood chips. These absorb rain, reduce evaporation, provide nutrients, increase soil organic matter, create habitat for soil organisms, suppress weed growth and seed germination, moderate diurnal temperature swings, protect against frost, and reduce erosion. Sheet mulching or lasagna gardening is a gardening technique that attempts to mimic the leaf cover that is found on forest floors.

=== No-till gardening ===


Edward Faulkner&#x27;s 1943 book &quot;Plowman&#x27;s Folly&quot;, King&#x27;s 1946 pamphlet &quot;Is Digging Necessary?&quot;, A. Guest&#x27;s 1948 book &quot;Gardening without Digging&quot;, and Fukuoka&#x27;s &quot;Do Nothing Farming&quot; all advocated forms of no-till or no-dig gardening. No-till gardening seeks to minimise disturbance to the soil community so as to maintain soil structure and organic matter.

=== Cropping practices ===

Low-effort permaculture favours perennial crops which do not require tilling and planting every year. Annual crops inevitably require more cultivation. They can be incorporated into permaculture by using traditional techniques such as crop rotation, intercropping, and companion planting so that pests and weeds of individual annual crop species do not build up, and minerals used by specific crop plants do not become successively depleted.

Companion planting aims to make use of beneficial interactions between species of cultivated plants. Such interactions include pest control, pollination, providing habitat for beneficial insects, and maximizing use of space; all of these may help to increase productivity.

=== Rainwater harvesting ===

Rainwater harvesting is the accumulation and storage of rainwater for reuse before it runs off or reaches the aquifer. It has been used to provide drinking water, water for livestock, and water for irrigation, as well as other typical uses. Rainwater collected from the roofs of houses and local institutions can make an important contribution to the availability of drinking water. It can supplement the water table and increase urban greenery. Water collected from the ground, sometimes from areas which are specially prepared for this purpose, is called stormwater harvesting.

Greywater is wastewater generated from domestic activities such as laundry, dishwashing, and bathing, which can be recycled for uses such as landscape irrigation and constructed wetlands. Greywater is largely sterile, but not potable (drinkable).

Keyline design is a technique for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources. It was developed in Australia by farmer and engineer P. A. Yeomans. &quot;Keyline&quot; refers to a contour line extending in both directions from a keypoint. Plowing above and below the keyline provides a watercourse that directs water away from a purely downhill course to reduce erosion and encourage infiltration. It is used in designing drainage systems.

=== Compost production ===

Vermicomposting is a common practice in permaculture. The practice involves using earthworms, such as red wigglers, to break down green and brown waste. The worms produce worm castings, which can be used to organically fertilize the garden. Worms are also introduced to garden beds, helping to aerate the soil and improve water retention. Worms may multiply quickly if provided conditions are ideal. For example, a permaculture farm in Cuba began with 9 tiger worms in 2001 and 15 years later had a population of over 500,000. The worm castings are particularly useful as part of a seed starting mix and regular fertilizer. Worm castings are reportedly more successful than conventional compost for seed starting.

Sewage or blackwater contains human or animal waste. It can be composted, producing biogas and manure. Human waste can be sourced from a composting toilet, outhouse or dry bog (rather than a plumbed toilet). 

=== Economising on space ===

Space can be saved in permaculture gardens with techniques such as herb spirals which group plants closely together. A herb spiral, invented by Mollison, is a round cairn of stones packed with earth at the base and sand higher up; sometimes there is a small pond on the south side (in the northern hemisphere). The result is a series of microclimate zones, wetter at the base, drier at the top, warmer and sunnier on the south side, cooler and drier to the north. Each herb is planted in the zone best suited to it.

=== Domesticated animals ===


Domesticated animals are often incorporated into site design. Activities that contribute to the system include: foraging to cycle nutrients, clearing fallen fruit, weed maintenance, spreading seeds, and pest maintenance. Nutrients are cycled by animals, transformed from their less digestible form (such as grass or twigs) into more nutrient-dense manure.

Multiple animals can contribute, including cows, goats, chickens, geese, turkey, rabbits, and worms. An example is chickens who can be used to scratch over the soil, thus breaking down the topsoil and using fecal matter as manure. Factors such as timing and habits are critical. For example, animals require much more daily attention than plants.

=== Fruit trees ===

Masanobu Fukuoka experimented with no-pruning methods on his family farm in Japan, finding that trees which were never pruned could grow well, whereas previously-pruned trees often died when allowed to grow without further pruning. He felt that this reflected the Tao-philosophy of Wú wéi, meaning no action against nature or &quot;do-nothing&quot; farming. He claimed yields comparable to intensive arboriculture with pruning and chemical fertilisation.

== Applications ==

=== Agroforestry ===

Agroforestry uses the interactive benefits from combining trees and shrubs with crops or livestock. It combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems. Trees or shrubs are intentionally used within agricultural systems, or non-timber forest products are cultured in forest settings.

=== Forest gardens ===

Forest gardens or food forests are permaculture systems designed to mimic natural forests. Forest gardens incorporate processes and relationships that the designers understand to be valuable in natural ecosystems. A mature forest ecosystem is organised into layers with constituents such as trees, understory, ground cover, soil, fungi, insects, and other animals. Because plants grow to different heights, a diverse community of organisms can occupy a relatively small space, each at a different layer.

* Rhizosphere: Root layers within the soil. The major components of this layer are the soil and the organisms that live within it such as plant roots and zomes (including root crops such as potatoes and other edible tubers), fungi, insects, nematodes, and earthworms.
* Soil surface/groundcover: Overlaps with the herbaceous layer and the groundcover layer; however plants in this layer grow much closer to the ground, densely fill bare patches, and typically can tolerate some foot traffic. Cover crops retain soil and lessen erosion, along with green manures that add nutrients and organic matter, especially nitrogen.
* Herbaceous layer: Plants that die back to the ground every winter, if cold enough. No woody stems. Many beneficial plants such as culinary and medicinal herbs are in this layer; whether annuals, biennials, or perennials.
* Shrub layer: woody perennials of limited height. Includes most berry bushes.
* Understory layer: trees that flourish under the canopy.
* The canopy: the tallest trees. Large trees dominate, but typically do not saturate the area, &quot;i.e.,&quot; some patches are devoid of trees.
* Vertical layer: climbers or vines, such as runner beans and lima beans (vine varieties).

=== Suburban and urban permaculture ===

The fundamental element of suburban and urban permaculture is the efficient utilization of space. &quot;Wildfire&quot; journal suggests using methods such as the keyhole garden which require little space. Neighbors can collaborate to increase the scale of transformation, using sites such as recreation centers, neighborhood associations, city programs, faith groups, and schools. Columbia, an ecovillage in Portland, Oregon, consisting of 37 apartment condominiums, influenced its neighbors to implement permaculture principles, including in front-yard gardens. Suburban permaculture sites such as one in Eugene, Oregon, include rainwater catchment, edible landscaping, removing paved driveways, turning a garage into living space, and changing a south side patio into passive solar.

Vacant lot farms are community-managed farm sites, but are often seen by authorities as temporary rather than permanent. For example, Los Angeles&#x27; South Central Farm (1994–2006), one of the largest urban gardens in the United States, was bulldozed with approval from property owner Ralph Horowitz, despite community protest.

The possibilities and challenges for suburban or urban permaculture vary with the built environment around the world. For example, land is used more ecologically in Jaisalmer, India than in American planned cities such as Los Angeles:

=== Marine systems ===

Permaculture derives its origin from agriculture, although the same principles, especially its foundational ethics, can also be applied to mariculture, particularly seaweed farming. In Marine Permaculture, artificial upwelling of cold, deep ocean water is induced. When an attachment substrate is provided in association with such an upwelling, and kelp sporophytes are present, a kelp forest ecosystem can be established (since kelp needs the cool temperatures and abundant dissolved macronutrients present in such an environment). Microalgae proliferate as well. Marine forest habitat is beneficial for many fish species, and the kelp is a renewable resource for food, animal feed, medicines and various other commercial products. It is also a powerful tool for carbon fixation.

The upwelling can be powered by renewable energy on location. Vertical mixing has been reduced due to ocean stratification effects associated with climate change. Reduced vertical mixing and marine heatwaves have decimated seaweed ecosystems in many areas. Marine permaculture mitigates this by restoring some vertical mixing and preserves these important ecosystems. By preserving and regenerating habitat offshore on a platform, marine permaculture employs natural processes to regenerate marine life.

=== Grazing ===

Grazing is blamed for much destruction. However, when grazing is modeled after nature, it can have the opposite effect. Cell grazing is a system of grazing in which herds or flocks are regularly and systematically moved to fresh range with the intent to maximize forage quality and quantity. Sepp Holzer and Joel Salatin have shown how grazing can start ecological succession or prepare ground for planting. Allan Savory&#x27;s holistic management technique has been likened to &quot;a permaculture approach to rangeland management&quot;. One variation is conservation grazing, where the primary purpose of the animals is to benefit the environment and the animals are not necessarily used for meat, milk or fiber. Sheep can replace lawn mowers. Goats and sheep can eat invasive plants.

=== Natural building ===

Natural building involves using a range of building systems and materials that apply permaculture principles. The focus is on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful, or renewable resources, as well as those that, while recycled or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. For example, cement, a common building material, emits carbon dioxide and is harmful to the environment while natural building works with the environment, using materials that are biodegradable, such as cob, adobe, rammed earth (unburnt clay), and straw bale (which insulates as well as modern synthetic materials).

== Issues ==

=== Intellectual property ===

Trademark and copyright disputes surround the word &quot;permaculture.&quot; Mollison&#x27;s books claimed on the copyright page, &quot;The contents of this book and the word PERMACULTURE are copyright.&quot; Eventually Mollison acknowledged that he was mistaken and that no copyright protection existed.

In 2000, Mollison&#x27;s U.S.-based Permaculture Institute sought a service mark for the word &quot;permaculture&quot; when used in educational services such as conducting classes, seminars, or workshops. The service mark would have allowed Mollison and his two institutes to set enforceable guidelines regarding how permaculture could be taught and who could teach it, particularly with relation to the PDC, despite the fact that he had been certifying teachers since 1993. This attempt failed and was abandoned in 2001. Mollison&#x27;s application for trademarks in Australia for the terms &quot;Permaculture Design Course&quot; and &quot;Permaculture Design&quot; was withdrawn in 2003. In 2009 he sought a trademark for &quot;Permaculture: A Designers&#x27; Manual&quot; and &quot;Introduction to Permaculture&quot;, the names of two of his books. These applications were withdrawn in 2011. Australia has never authorized a trademark for the word &quot;permaculture&quot;.

===Definition===

The broad range of topics discussed in permaculture has led to criticism that permaculture is not clearly defined. Peter Harper from the Centre for Alternative Technology has lamented that, &quot;for some people &#x27;Permaculture&#x27; is a generic term for sustainable living, giving another whole set of shifting, fuzzy meanings&quot;. Even permaculture texts have expressed that &quot;there are as many permaculture definitions as there are permaculturists&quot;, although this is also seen as a strength of the flexibility of permaculture principles.

Studies of permaculture farms have showed a diversity as well as a number of consistent features. A 2017 study of 36 self-described American permaculture farms found a variety of business strategies, including small mixed farms, integrated producers of perennial and animal crops, mixes of production and services, livestock, and service-based businesses. A 2019 study by Hirschfeld and Van Acker found that adopting permaculture consistently encouraged cultivation of perennials, crop diversity, landscape heterogeneity, and nature conservation. They found that grass-roots adopters were &quot;remarkably consistent&quot; in their implementation of permaculture, leading them to conclude that the movement could exert influence over positive agroecological transitions. 

===Methodology===

Permaculture as a popular movement has been largely isolated from scientific literature. Most permaculture literature is non-scientific in nature and is written for non-specialists. Many permaculturalists rarely engage with mainstream research in agroecology, agroforestry, or ecological engineering, and permaculture publications rarely cite academic sources. In parallel, it was observed in 2007 that few academic papers studied permaculture principles or permaculture farm productivity. Going back to Mollison and Holmgren&#x27;s early publications, permaculturalists have often claimed that mainstream science has an elitist or pro-corporate bias, or that academic institutions are too rigid to study the interdisciplinary approach permaculture proposes.

This divide has led some to criticise permaculture as pseudo-scientific or to call for a more clear methodology to be used. Peter Harper has attempted to draw a distinction between &quot;&#x27;cult&#x27; permaculture&quot;, where oversimplified claims are assumed to be true and go untested, and &quot;&#x27;smart&#x27; permaculture&quot;, which acts &quot;more like an immature academic field&quot;. Some permaculturalists have also observed oversimplification, such as Robert Kourik, who commented that the supposed advantages of &quot;less- or no-work gardening, bountiful yields, and the soft fuzzy glow of knowing that the garden will ... live on without you&quot; were often illusory.

More recently, permaculture has started to be an object of scientific study. Julius Krebs and Sonja Bach argue in a 2018 issue of &quot;Sustainability&quot; that there is &quot;scientific evidence for all twelve [of Holmgren&#x27;s] principles&quot;. In 2024, Reiff and colleagues stated that permaculture is a &quot;sustainable alternative to conventional agriculture&quot;, and that it &quot;strongly&quot; enhances carbon stocks, soil quality, and biodiversity, making it &quot;an effective tool to promote sustainable agriculture, ensure sustainable production patterns, combat climate change and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss.&quot; They point out that most of permaculture’s most common methods, such as agroforestry, polycultures, and water harvesting features, are also backed by peer-reviewed research.

<text>Incarnation literally means &quot;embodied in flesh&quot; or &quot;taking on flesh&quot;. It is the conception and the embodiment of a deity or spirit in some earthly form or an anthropomorphic form of a god. It is used to mean a god, deity, or Divine Being in human or animal form on Earth. The proper noun, Incarnation, refers to the union of divinity with humanity in Jesus Christ.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Christianity===
The incarnation of Christ (or Incarnation) is the central Christian doctrine that God became flesh, assumed of human nature, and became a man in the form of Jesus, the Son of God and the second person of the Trinity. This foundational Christian position holds that the divine nature of the Son of God was perfectly united with human nature in one divine Person, Jesus, making him both truly God and truly human. The theological term for this is hypostatic union: the second person of the Trinity, God the Son, became flesh when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Biblical passages traditionally referenced in connection with the doctrine of the Incarnation include , , and .

===Druze faith===

Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad is considered the founder of the Druze faith and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts, he proclaimed that God had become human and taken the form of man, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah is an important figure in the Druze faith whose eponymous founder ad-Darazi proclaimed him as the incarnation of God in 1018.

Historian David R. W. Bryer defines the Druzes as &quot;ghulat&quot; of Isma&#x27;ilism, since they exaggerated the cult of the caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah and considered him divine; he also defines the Druzes as a religion that deviated from Islam. He also added that as a result of this deviation, the Druze faith &quot;seems as different from Islam as Islam is from Christianity or Christianity is from Judaism&quot;.

Some scholars believe Christian elements are deeply embedded in Druze beliefs, introduced through Isma’ili traditions. This is evident in the Druze creed, which deifies al-Hākim bi Amrillāh. The initiation text, &quot;Mīthāq Walī al-Zamān&quot; (Pact of Time Custodian), which begins with, “I rely on our Moula Al-Hakim the lonely God, the individual, the eternal... Obedience of almighty Moulana Al-Hākim, exalted be him and that obedience is worship and that he does not have any partners ever, present or coming”, closely resembles Christian beliefs about Jesus&#x27; divinity. The Druze also view figures like Jesus, al-Hākim bi Amrillāh, and Hamza ibn Ali as the Messiah or Mahdi. They believe al-Hākim will return at the end of times to judge the world and establish his kingdom, while Hamza ibn Ali is considered a reincarnation of Jesus, the Universal Mind &quot;&#x27;Aql&quot;, closely associated with al-Hākim.

===Islam===

Islam completely rejects the doctrine of the incarnation (Mu&#x27;jassimā / &quot;(Tajseem)&quot; Tajsīm) of God in any form, as the concept is defined as &quot;shirk&quot;. In Islam, God is one and &quot;neither begets nor is begotten&quot;.

===Judaism===
According to many modern scholars, the Biblical and Talmudic view of God was anthropomorphic. God could sometimes appear in bodily form. The Babylonian Talmud contains stories of earthly appearances of God, Elijah, Satan, and demons.

Since the time of Maimonides, mainstream Judaism has mostly rejected any possibility of an incarnation of God in any form.

However, some modern-day Hasidim believe in a somewhat similar concept. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, a prominent Hasidic leader, said that the &quot;Rebbe&quot; is God&#x27;s essence itself put into the body of a &quot;tzadik&quot;.

===Rastafari===

Rastas refer to God as Jah, a shortened name for God used in English translations of the Bible. Rastafari emphasises the immanence of Jah, who partially resides within every person, in a manner similar to the Hindu concept of Brahman. The unity of divinity and humanity is often reflected in the saying &quot;I and I&quot;, and the aphorism &quot;God is man and man is God&quot;. Rastafari practices known as livity, influenced by the Nazirite vow, are seen as a way to embrace this inner divinity.

Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974, is traditionally seen by Rastas as the Second Coming of Jesus or Jah incarnate, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;the living God&quot;. To others, he is a human who embodies the teachings of Christ, or a distinct human prophet who symbolises the divinity within humankind. Leonard Barrett has argued that many Rastas believe in a form of reincarnation, where Moses, Elijah, Jesus and then Haile Selassie are avatars of Jah. R. Matthew Charet has argued that &quot;Christ&quot; is a title for Rastas much as &quot;Buddha&quot; is for Buddhists, and that Christ&#x27;s divine connection is not unique to Jesus but may be attained by all humans through a &quot;discovery of the Christ-consciousness in us all&quot;.

==Baháʼí Faith==

In the Baháʼí Faith, God is not seen to be incarnated into this world and is not seen to be part of creation as he cannot be divided and does not descend to the condition of his creatures. The Manifestations of God are also not seen as incarnations of God but are instead understood to be like perfect mirrors reflecting the attributes of God onto the material world.

==Buddhism==

Buddhism is a nontheistic religion: it denies the concept of a creator deity or any incarnation of a creator deity. However, Buddhism does teach the rebirth doctrine and asserts that living beings are reborn, endlessly, reincarnating as devas (gods), demi-gods, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts or hellish beings, in a cycle of &quot;samsara&quot; that stops only for those who reach nirvana (&quot;nibbana&quot;).

In Tibetan Buddhism, an enlightened spiritual teacher (lama) is believed to reincarnate, and is called a &quot;tulku&quot;. According to Tulku Thond, there are three main types of tulkus. They are the emanations of buddhas, the manifestations of highly accomplished adepts, and rebirths of highly virtuous teachers or spiritual friends. There are also authentic secondary types, which include unrecognized tulkus, blessed tulkus, and tulkus fallen from the path.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism, incarnation refers to its rebirth doctrine, and in its theistic traditions to &quot;avatar&quot;. Avatar literally means &quot;descent, alight, to make one&#x27;s appearance&quot;, and refers to the embodiment of the essence of a superhuman being or a deity in another form. The word also implies &quot;to overcome, to remove, to bring down, to cross something&quot;. In Hindu traditions, the &quot;crossing or coming down&quot; is symbolism, states Daniel Bassuk, of the divine descent from &quot;eternity into the temporal realm, from unconditioned to the conditioned, from infinitude to finitude&quot;. An avatar, states Justin Edwards Abbott, is a &quot;saguna&quot; (with form, attributes) embodiment of the &quot;nirguna Brahman or Atman (soul).

Neither the Vedas nor the Principal Upanishads ever mentions the word &quot;avatar&quot; as a noun. The verb roots and form, such as &quot;avatarana&quot;, do appear in ancient post-Vedic Hindu texts, but as &quot;action of descending&quot;, but not as an incarnated person (avatara). The related verb &quot;avatarana&quot; is, states Paul Hacker, used with double meaning, one as action of the divine descending, another as &quot;laying down the burden of man&quot; suffering from the forces of evil.

The term is most commonly found in the context of the Hindu god Vishnu. The earliest mention of Vishnu manifested in a human form to empower the good and fight against evil, uses other terms such as the word &quot;sambhavāmi&quot; in verse 4.6 and the word &quot;tanu&quot; in verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita, as well as other words such as &quot;akriti&quot; and &quot;rupa&quot; elsewhere. It is in medieval era texts, those composed after the sixth century CE, that the noun version of avatar appears, where it means embodiment of a deity. The incarnation idea proliferates thereafter, in the Puranic stories for many deities, and with ideas such as &quot;ansha-avatar&quot; or partial embodiments.

While avatars of other deities such as Ganesha and Shiva are also mentioned in medieval Hindu texts, this is minor and occasional. The incarnation doctrine is one of the important differences between Vaishnavism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.

===Avatar versus incarnation===
The translation of avatar as &quot;incarnation&quot; has been questioned by Christian theologians, who state that an incarnation is in flesh and imperfect, while avatar is mythical and perfect. The theological concept of Christ as an incarnation into the womb of the Virgin Mary and by work of the Holy Spirit, as found in Christology, presents the Christian concept of incarnation. Mercy Amba Oduyoye and H. M. Vroom state that this is different from the Hindu concept of avatar because avatars in Hinduism are unreal and the Christian concept is similar to Docetism. Sheth disagrees and states that this claim is an incorrect understanding of the Hindu concept of avatar. Avatars are true embodiments of spiritual perfection, one driven by noble goals, in Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism.

==Serer religion==
The Serer religion of West Africa rejects any notions of incarnation or manifestation of the supreme deity &quot;Roog&quot; (also called Koox in the Cangin language). However, the reincarnation (&quot;ciiɗ&quot;) of the ancient Serer saints and ancestral spirits, called &quot;Pangool&quot;, is a well-held principle in Serer religion. These Pangool (singular: &quot;Fangool&quot;) act as intermediaries between the living world and the divine. When the Serers speak of incarnation, it is these &quot;Pangool&quot; they refer to, who are themselves holy by virtue of their intercession with the divine.

<doc id="78217" wikidata="Q615944" url="?curid=78217" title="The Mary Tyler Moore Show">
<text>The Mary Tyler Moore Show (also known simply as Mary Tyler Moore) is an American television sitcom created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns and starring actress Mary Tyler Moore. The show originally aired on CBS from September 19, 1970, to March 19, 1977. Moore portrayed Mary Richards, an unmarried, independent woman focused on her career as associate producer of a news show at the fictional local station WJM in Minneapolis. Ed Asner co-starred as Mary&#x27;s boss Lou Grant, alongside Gavin MacLeod, Ted Knight, Georgia Engel, Betty White, Valerie Harper as friend and neighbor Rhoda Morgenstern, and Cloris Leachman as friend and landlady Phyllis Lindstrom.

&quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; proved to be a groundbreaking series in the era of second-wave feminism; portraying a central female character who was neither married nor dependent on a man was a rarity on American television in the 1970s. The show has been celebrated for its complex, relatable characters and storylines. &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; received consistent praise from critics and high ratings during its original run and earned 29 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series three years in a row (1975–1977). Moore received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series three times. The series also launched three spin-offs: &quot;Rhoda&quot;, &quot;Phyllis&quot;, and &quot;Lou Grant&quot;. 

&quot; The Mary Tyler Moore Show &quot; is regarded as one of the most popular and influential television series of all time and a pioneering achievement for women in television. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; No. 6 on its list of the &quot;101 Best Written TV Series of All Time&quot;. In 2022, Rolling Stone ranked the show No. 10 on its list of the 100 greatest TV shows and in 2023, Variety recognized it as No. 9 on its own list of the 100 greatest TV shows.

== Seasons ==

==Premise==
Mary Richards (Moore) is a single woman who, at age 30, moves to Minneapolis on the heels of a broken engagement. She applies for a secretarial job at fictional television station WJM, but the position is already taken. She is instead offered the post of associate producer of the station&#x27;s six o&#x27;clock news. She befriends tough but lovable boss Lou Grant (Ed Asner), newswriter Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod), and buffoonish anchorman Ted Baxter (Ted Knight). Mary is later promoted to producer of the show, though her duties remain the same.

Mary rents a third-floor studio apartment in a 19th-century house from acquaintance Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman); after a rocky introduction, Mary and her upstairs neighbor Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) become best friends. Characters introduced later in the series include the acerbic, man-hungry hostess of WJM&#x27;s &quot;Happy Homemaker&quot; show, Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White), and soft-voiced, sweet-natured Georgette Franklin (Georgia Engel), as Ted Baxter&#x27;s girlfriend (and eventual wife). At the beginning of season 6, after both Rhoda and Phyllis move away (providing a premise for two spinoffs), Mary relocates to a one-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building; Minneapolis&#x27;s Riverside Plaza was used for establishing shots.

From the beginning, issues such as workplace discrimination against women figured into episode stories. In the third season, issues such as equal pay for women, pre-marital sex, and homosexuality are woven into the show&#x27;s comedic plots. In season four, marital infidelity and divorce are explored with Phyllis and Lou, respectively. In the fifth season, Mary refuses to reveal a news source and is jailed for contempt of court. While in jail, she befriends a prostitute (Barbara Colby) who seeks Mary&#x27;s help in a subsequent episode. In the highly rated sixth-season episode &quot;The Seminar&quot;, Betty Ford appears in a cameo role, becoming the first First Lady to appear on a television sitcom. The show&#x27;s final seasons explore death in &quot;Chuckles Bites the Dust&quot; and juvenile offenders in &quot;Mary&#x27;s Delinquent&quot;; Ted suffers a heart attack; Ted and Georgette contend with intimate marital problems, deal with infertility, and adopt a child; and Mary overcomes an addiction to sleeping pills. Mary dates many men on and off over the years but remains single throughout the series.

One of the show&#x27;s running gags is Mary&#x27;s inability to throw a successful, problem-free party. Various disasters throughout the seasons include the break-up of two of Mary&#x27;s closest friends; an insufficient amount of food due to unexpected guests; a power failure while attendees await the arrival of a high-profile guest of honor (Johnny Carson); and the birth of Ted and Georgette&#x27;s baby.

* Lou Grant (Ed Asner) is producer (later executive producer) of the news. His tough and grumpy demeanor initially hides his kind-hearted nature which is gradually revealed as the series progresses. He is referred to as &quot;Lou&quot; by everyone, including Mary&#x27;s friends, with the exception of Mary herself, who can rarely bring herself to call him anything other than &quot;Mr. Grant&quot;. He is married to Edie (Priscilla Morrill), but during the run of the show they separate and divorce.
* Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod), head writer, makes frequent quips about Ted Baxter&#x27;s mangling of his news copy and Sue Ann Nivens&#x27; aggressive, man-hungry attitude. He is Mary&#x27;s closest coworker and close friend. Murray is married to the occasionally seen Marie (Joyce Bulifant) and, like Lou Grant, he has three biological daughters. Murray and Marie also adopt an orphaned Vietnamese boy during the series.
* Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) is the dim-witted, vain, and miserly anchorman of the &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. He frequently makes mistakes and is oblivious to the actual nature of the topics covered on the show but, to cover for tormenting insecurity, he postures as the country&#x27;s best news journalist. He is often criticized by others, especially Murray and Lou, for his many shortcomings, but is never fired from his position. Initially a comic buffoon in the series, Ted&#x27;s better nature is gradually revealed as the series unfolds, helped along by his sweet, seemingly vague, but frequently perceptive wife Georgette.
* Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) (1970–1974, 1975, 1977) (Regular, seasons 1–4; Guest, seasons 6–7) is Mary&#x27;s upstairs neighbor and best friend. She works as a window dresser, first at the fictional Bloomfield&#x27;s Department Store and later at Hempel&#x27;s Department Store. Though insecure about her appearance, she is also outgoing and sardonic, making frequent wisecracks, often at her own expense. Like Mary, she is single. She dates frequently, routinely joking about her disastrous dates. Rhoda moves to New York City and falls in love after the fourth season, beginning the spinoff series &quot;Rhoda&quot;.
* Phyllis Lindstrom (Cloris Leachman) (1970–1975) (Season 1–5, 7 Guest) is Mary&#x27;s snobbish friend and landlady. She is in many episodes of the first two seasons, after which her appearances decline in frequency. She is married to unseen dermatologist Lars and has a precocious daughter, Bess (Lisa Gerritsen). She is actively involved in groups and clubs and is a political activist and a supporter of Women&#x27;s Liberation. Rhoda and Phyllis are usually at odds and often trade insults. After appearing in three episodes of season five, Leachman left to star in the spin-off show &quot;Phyllis&quot;. In that series, it is explained Phyllis has been widowed. Discovering that her husband had virtually no assets and that she must support herself, Phyllis returns to her home town of San Francisco.
* Georgette Franklin Baxter (Georgia Engel) (1972–77) (Season 3–7) is the somewhat ditzy girlfriend of stentorian news anchor Ted Baxter. Mary Tyler Moore described her as a cross between Stan Laurel and Marilyn Monroe. She and Mary get along fantastically, and Georgette helps fill the void created by the departure of Rhoda and Phyllis. Georgette, a co-worker of Rhoda&#x27;s at Hempel&#x27;s Department Store, is introduced as a guest at one of Mary&#x27;s parties. Later, she works for a car rental service, as a Golden Girl, and for Rhoda selling plants. Georgette is devoted to Ted and they eventually marry in Mary&#x27;s apartment. They adopt a child named David (Robbie Rist), and later, Georgette gives birth in Mary&#x27;s apartment to a girl who is (temporarily) named Mary Lou.
* Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) (1973–1977) (Season 4–7), host of WJM&#x27;s &quot;The Happy Homemaker&quot; show. While her demeanor is superficially cheerful, she makes judgmental comments about Mary, exchanges personal insults with Murray, and uses many sexual double entendres, especially around Lou, to whom she is strongly attracted.

== Production ==

When Moore was approached about the show, she &quot;was unsure and unwilling to commit, fearing any new role might suffer in comparison with her Laura Petrie character in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&quot; which also aired on CBS, and was already cemented as one of the most popular parts in TV history&quot;. Moore&#x27;s character was initially intended to be a divorcée, but divorce was still controversial at the time. In addition, CBS was afraid viewers might think that Mary had divorced Rob Petrie, Laura&#x27;s husband on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show,&quot; so the premise was changed to that of a single woman with a recently broken engagement. Notably, Van Dyke never guest-starred in any episode, although his brother Jerry Van Dyke guest-starred in a couple of episodes during the third and fourth seasons. (Jerry had also regularly appeared on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show.&quot;)

According to co-creator Allan Burns, Minnesota was selected for the show&#x27;s location after &quot;one of the writers began talking about the strengths and weaknesses of the Vikings&quot;. A television newsroom was chosen for the show&#x27;s workplace because of the supporting characters often found there, stated co-creator James Brooks. Aside from establishing shots and the title sequence, the show was filmed at the CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles.

===Kenwood Parkway house===

In 1995, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that &quot;TV&#x27;s most famous bachelorette pad&quot; was Mary&#x27;s apartment. The fictitious address was 119 North Weatherly, but the exterior establishing shots were of a real house in Minneapolis at 2104 Kenwood Parkway. In the real house, an unfinished attic occupied the space behind the window recreated on the interior studio set of Mary&#x27;s apartment. Minneapolis architect Edward Somerby Stebbins designed the 1892 residence for S. E. Davis.

Once fans of the series discovered where exterior shots had been taken, the house became a popular tourist destination. According to Moore, the woman who lived in the house was &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by people showing up and &quot;asking if Mary was around&quot;. To discourage crews from filming additional footage of the house, the owners placed an &quot;Impeach Nixon&quot; sign beneath the window where Mary supposedly lived. The house continued to attract multiple tour buses a day more than a decade after production ended.

In January 2017, the house was marketed for a price of $1.7 million.

=== Title sequences ===

The opening title sequence features many scenes filmed on location in Minneapolis in both summer and winter, as well as a few clips from the show&#x27;s studio scenes. The sequence changed each season, but always ended with Mary tossing her hat into the air in front of what was then the flagship Donaldson&#x27;s department store at the intersection of South 7th Street and Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis. The hat toss was ranked by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as the second greatest moment in television. On May 8, 2002, Moore was in attendance when basic cable network TV Land dedicated a statue to her that captured her iconic throw. In 2010, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked the show&#x27;s opening title sequence No. 3 on a list of TV&#x27;s Top Ten credit sequences, as selected by readers. In 2017, James Charisma of &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the show&#x27;s opening sequence No. 15 on a list of &quot;The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time.&quot;

Sonny Curtis wrote and performed the opening theme song, &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;. The lyrics changed between the first and second seasons, in part to reflect Mary Richards having become settled in her new home. The later lyrics, which accompanied many more episodes at a time when the show&#x27;s popularity was at a peak, are more widely known, and most covers of the song use these words. For season 7, there was a slightly new musical arrangement for the opening theme, but the lyrics remained the same as seasons 2–6.

No supporting cast members are credited during the show&#x27;s opening (though from the second season on, shots of them appear). The ending sequences show snippets of the cast, as well as any major guest stars in that episode, with the actors&#x27; names at the bottom of the screen. Other on-location scenes are also shown during the closing credits, including a rear shot of Mary holding hands with her date, played by Moore&#x27;s then-husband, Grant Tinker, and Moore and Valerie Harper feeding ducks on the bank of a pond in a Minneapolis park (this shot remained in the credits, even after Harper left the show). Many of the opening shots were filmed at Lake of the Isles. The ending sequence music is an instrumental version of &quot;Love is All Around&quot;. The ending finishes with Mimsie the cat meowing within the MTM company logo.

== Cultural impact ==
In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; put &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; on its list of &quot;17 Shows That Changed TV&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; stated that the series &quot;liberated TV for adults—of both sexes&quot; by being &quot;a sophisticated show about grownups among other grownups, having grownup conversations&quot;. The Associated Press said that the show &quot;took 20 years of pointless, insipid situation comedy and spun it on its heels. [It did this by] pioneer[ing] reality comedy and the establishment of clearly defined and motivated secondary characters.&quot;

Tina Fey, creator and lead actress of the 2006-debut sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;, explained that Moore&#x27;s show helped inspire &quot;30 Rock&quot;″s emphasis on office relationships. &quot;Our goal is to try to be like &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, where it&#x27;s not about doing the news&quot;, said Fey. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also noted that the main characters of &quot;30 Rock&quot; mirror those of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

When the writers of the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; were about to create their series finale, they watched several other sitcom finales. Co-creator Marta Kauffman said that the last episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; was the &quot;gold standard&quot; and that it influenced the finale of &quot;Friends&quot;.

=== Spin-offs, specials and reunions ===

The show spun off three television series, all of which aired on CBS: the sitcoms &quot;Rhoda&quot; (1974–78) and &quot;Phyllis&quot; (1975–77), and the one-hour drama &quot;Lou Grant&quot; (1977–82). In 2000, Moore and Harper reprised their roles in a two-hour ABC TV-movie, &quot;Mary and Rhoda&quot;.

Two retrospective specials were produced by CBS: &quot;Mary Tyler Moore: The 20th Anniversary Show&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Reunion&quot; (2002). On May 19, 2008, the surviving cast members of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; reunited on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; to reminisce about the series. Winfrey, a longtime admirer of Moore and the show, had her staff recreate the sets of the WJM-TV newsroom and Mary&#x27;s apartment (seasons 1–5) for the reunion.

In 2013, the women of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; – Cloris Leachman, Valerie Harper, Mary Tyler Moore, Betty White, and Georgia Engel – reunited on the TV Land sitcom &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;, which aired on September 4. Katie Couric interviewed the cast on &quot;Katie&quot; as they celebrated acting together for the first time in more than 30 years. It would be their final time on-screen together, as Mary Tyler Moore died in January 2017.

=== In popular culture ===
The show has remained popular since the final episode was broadcast in 1977. Several songs, films and other television programs reference or parody characters and events from the show, including the memorable &quot;can turn the world on with her smile&quot; line from the title song. Parodies were done on shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;MadTV&quot;, and &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (which was produced in Minneapolis). Musical artist Barbara Kessler and groups The Hold Steady and Relient K have all referred to the show in their songs.

The show has also been mentioned in film. In the Will Ferrell comedy film &quot;&quot;, the name of Burgundy&#x27;s dog, Baxter, refers to the character Ted Baxter, and the head of the newsroom staff is named Ed, honoring Ed Asner. In the 1997 film &quot;Romy &amp; Michele&#x27;s High School Reunion&quot;, the characters argue with each other while exclaiming &quot;I&#x27;m the Mary and you&#x27;re the Rhoda.&quot; Frank DeCaro of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that this was the highlight of the film.

The show&#x27;s Emmy-winning final episode has been alluded to many times in other series&#x27; closing episodes, such as the 1988 finale of &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (including the group shuffle to the tissue box).

==Broadcast history==

===United States===
For most of its broadcasting run, the program was the lead-in for &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, which was also produced by MTM Enterprises.

====Syndication====
The show did not do well initially in syndication, never being shown in more than 25% of the United States at a time, according to Robert S. Alley, the co-author of a book about the series. In the fall of 1992, Nick at Nite began broadcasting the series nightly, launching it with a week-long &quot;Mary-thon&quot;, and it became the network&#x27;s top-rated series.

It is available on Hulu and through Pluto. It was a longtime staple of Weigel Broadcasting&#x27;s MeTV network dating back to its 2003 launch in Chicago, expanding nationwide in 2011, but has since moved to Decades, partly owned by Weigel.

===United Kingdom===
The series was broadcast on BBC1 from February 13, 1971, to December 29, 1972. The BBC broadcast the first 34 episodes before the series was dropped. Beginning in 1975, a number of ITV companies picked up the series. Channel 4 repeated the first 39 episodes between January 30, 1984, and August 23, 1985. The full series was repeated on The Family Channel from 1993 to 1996.

== Home media ==
The entire series was released on DVD in Region 1 between 2002 and 2010. Originally, season 1 was housed in a multi-panel fold-out digipak in a slipcase, while seasons 2-4 were issued in a slipcase, with each disc being housed in its own slim case. Starting with season 5, each season was issued in a standard 3-disc DVD keepcase, and seasons 1-4 were reissued in the same style of DVD packaging. The discs from each of these releases were repackaged in 2018 as a complete series set.

On the season 7 DVD, the last episode&#x27;s &quot;final curtain call&quot;, broadcast only once on March 19, 1977 (March 18 in Canada), was included at the request of fans. However, some of the season 7 sets did not include the curtain call; a replacement disc is reported to be available from the manufacturer.

== Critical response ==

On Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 holds an approval rating of 92% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 10.00/10. Critics consensus reads: &quot;An exceptional ensemble and a smart sense of humor suggest, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and its titular star may just make it after all&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==

<doc id="78219" wikidata="Q334997" url="?curid=78219" title="Masanobu Fukuoka">
<text>was a Japanese farmer and philosopher celebrated for his natural farming and re-vegetation of desertified lands. He was a proponent of no-till, herbicide and pesticide-free cultivation methods from which he created a particular method of agriculture, commonly referred to as &quot;natural farming&quot; or &quot;do-nothing farming&quot;.

Fukuoka was the author of several books, scientific papers and other publications, and was featured in television documentaries and interviews from the 1970s onwards. His influences went beyond farming to inspire individuals within the natural food and lifestyle movements. He was an outspoken advocate of the value of observing nature&#x27;s principles.

==Life==
Fukuoka was born on 2 February 1913 in Iyo, Ehime, Japan, the second son of Kameichi Fukuoka, an educated and wealthy land owner and local leader. He attended Gifu Prefecture Agricultural College and trained as a microbiologist and agricultural scientist, beginning a career as a research scientist specialising in plant pathology. He worked at the Plant Inspection Division of the Yokohama Customs Bureau in 1934 as an agricultural customs inspector. In 1937 he was hospitalised with pneumonia, and while recovering, he stated that he had a profound spiritual experience that transformed his world view and led him to doubt the practices of modern &quot;Western&quot; agricultural science. He immediately resigned from his post as a research scientist, returning to his family&#x27;s farm on the island of Shikoku in southern Japan.
From 1938, Fukuoka began to practice and experiment with new techniques on organic citrus orchards and used the observations gained to develop the idea of &quot;Natural Farming&quot;. Among other practices, he abandoned pruning an area of citrus trees, which caused the trees to become affected by insects and the branches to become entangled. He stated that the experience taught him the difference between nature and non-intervention. His efforts were interrupted by World War II, during which he worked at the Kōchi Prefecture agricultural experiment station on subjects including farming research and food production.
In 1940, Fukuoka married his wife Ayako, and they had five children together. After World War II, his father lost most of the family lands in postwar land reform and was left with three-eighths of an acre of rice land and the hillside citrus orchards his son had taken over before the war. Despite these circumstances, in 1947 he took up natural farming again with success, using no-till farming methods to raise rice and barley. He wrote his first book, &quot;Mu 1: The God Revolution&quot;, or in Japanese, during the same year, and worked to spread word of the benefits of his methods and philosophy. His later book, &quot;The One-Straw Revolution&quot;, was published in 1975 and translated into English in 1978.

From 1979, Fukuoka travelled the world extensively, giving lectures, working directly to plant seeds and re-vegetate areas, and receiving a number of awards in various countries in recognition of his work and achievements. By the 1980s, Fukuoka recorded that he and his family shipped some 6,000 crates of citrus to Tokyo each year, totalling about 90 tonnes.

During his first journey overseas, Fukuoka was accompanied by his wife Ayako, met macrobiotic diet leaders Michio Kushi and Herman Aihara, and was guided by his leading supporter and translation editor Larry Korn. They sowed seeds in desertified land, visited the University of California in Berkeley and Los Angeles, the Green Gulch Farm Zen Center, the Lundberg Family Farms, and met with United Nations UNCCD representatives including Maurice Strong, who encouraged Fukuoka&#x27;s practical involvement in the &quot;Plan of Action to Combat Desertification&quot;. He also travelled to New York City and surrounding areas such as Boston and Amherst College in Massachusetts.

In 1983, he travelled to Europe for 50 days holding workshops, educating farmers and sowing seeds. In 1985, he spent 40 days in Somalia and Ethiopia, sowing seeds to re-vegetate desert areas, including working in remote villages and a refugee camp. The following year he returned to the United States, speaking at three international conferences on natural farming in Washington state, San Francisco and at the Agriculture Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Fukuoka also took the opportunity to visit farms, forests and cities giving lectures and meeting people. In 1988, he lectured at the Indian Science Congress, state agricultural universities and other venues.

Fukuoka went to Thailand in 1990 and 1991, visiting farms and collecting seeds for re-vegetating deserts in India, which he returned to during November and December that year in an attempt to re-vegetate them. The next year saw him participate in official meetings in Japan associated with the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil, and in 1996 he returned to Africa, sowing seeds in desert areas of Tanzania, observing baobab trees and jungle country. He taught the making and sowing of clay seed balls in Vietnam during 1995.

He travelled to the Philippines in 1998, carrying out Natural Farming research, and visited Greece later that year to assist plans to re-vegetate 10,000 hectares (40 sq. mi.) around the Lake Vegoritida area in the Pella regional unit and to produce a film of the major seed ball effort. The next year he returned to Europe, visiting Mallorca.

He visited China in 2001, and in 2002 he returned again to India to speak at the &quot;Nature as Teacher&quot; workshop at Navdanya Farm and at Bija Vidyapeeth Earth University in Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand in northern India. On Gandhi&#x27;s Day, he gave the third annual Albert Howard Memorial Lecture to attendees from all six continents. That autumn he was to visit Afghanistan with Yuko Honma but was unable to attend, shipping eight tons of seed in his stead. In 2005, he gave a brief lecture at the World Expo in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, and in May 2006 he appeared in an hour-long interview on Japanese television network NHK.

Masanobu Fukuoka died on 16 August 2008 at the age of 95, after a period of declining mobility that made him reliant on a wheelchair.

==Natural farming==
Fukuoka called his agricultural philosophy , most commonly translated into English as &quot;natural farming&quot;. It is also referred to as &quot;the Fukuoka Method&quot;, &quot;the natural way of farming&quot; or &quot;Do-Nothing Farming&quot;.

The system is based on the recognition of the complexity of living organisms that shape an ecosystem and deliberately exploiting it. Fukuoka saw farming not just as a means of producing food but as an aesthetic and spiritual approach to life, the ultimate goal of which was &quot;the cultivation and perfection of human beings&quot;.

The four principles of natural farming are that:

* human cultivation of soil, plowing or tilling are unnecessary, as is the use of powered machines
* prepared fertilizers are unnecessary, as is the process of preparing compost
* weeding, either by cultivation or by herbicides, is unnecessary; instead, only minimal weed suppression with minimal disturbance should be used
* applications of pesticides or herbicides are unnecessary

==Clay seed balls==
Fukuoka re-invented and advanced the use of clay seed balls. Clay seed balls were originally an ancient practice in which seeds for the next season&#x27;s crops are mixed together, sometimes with humus or compost for microbial inoculants, and then are rolled within clay to form into small balls. This method is now commonly used in guerilla gardening to rapidly seed restricted or private areas.

==Awards==
In 1988, Fukuoka received the Visva-Bharati University&#x27;s Desikottam Award as well as the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in the Philippines, often considered &quot;Asia&#x27;s Nobel Prize&quot;.

In March 1997, the Earth Summit+5 forum in Rio de Janeiro presented him with the Earth Council Award, received in person at a ceremony in Tokyo on 26 May of that year, honouring him for his contributions to sustainable development.

In 1998, Fukuoka received a grant of US$10,000 from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, but the grant was returned because his advanced age prevented him from completing the project.

==Influence==

In the international development of the organic farming movement, Fukuoka is considered to be amongst the &quot;five giant personalities who inspired the movement&quot; along with Austrian Rudolf Steiner, German-Swiss Hans Müller, Lady Eve Balfour in the United Kingdom and J. I. Rodale in the United States.

His books are considered both farming compendiums and guides to a way of life.

&quot;The One-Straw Revolution&quot; has been translated into over 20 languages and sold more than one million copies and Fukuoka has been widely influential, inspiring an international movement of individuals discovering and applying his principles to varying degrees, such as Akinori Kimura, David Mas Masumoto and Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, and has significantly influenced alternative movements in the West, such as permaculture.

Rosana Tositrakul, a Thai activist and politician, spent a year studying with Fukuoka on his farm. She then organised a visit by Fukuoka to the Kut Chum District of Yasothon Province in northeastern Thailand, which, together with his books, were influential in the rapid and widespread adoption of organic and chemical-free rice farming in the district.

==Reception==
In the preface to the US editions of &quot;The One-Straw Revolution&quot;, Wendell Berry wrote that Fukuoka&#x27;s techniques are not &quot;directly applicable to most American farms&quot;, but ultimately concludes that it would be &quot;a mistake to assume that the practical passages of this book are worthless...&quot; suggesting that Natural Farming would require farmers to have fresh eyes and the right kind of concern for their land in order to come up with methods relevant to their own farms.

Fukuoka&#x27;s techniques have proven difficult to apply, even on most Japanese farms, and have been described as a sophisticated approach despite their simple appearance. In the initial years of transition from conventional farming there are losses in crop yields. Fukuoka estimated these to be 10% while others, such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, have found attempting to strictly follow Fukuoka&#x27;s techniques led to crop failures and require many years of adaption to make the principles work.

In the early 2000s, Theodor Friedrich and Josef Kienzle of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) opined that his rejection of mechanisation is not justifiable for modern agricultural production and that the system cannot interact effectively with conventional agricultural systems.

More recently however, the FAO (along with multiple research universities and organizations such as the Union of Concerned Scientists) have found conventional industrial agriculture systems to be rooted in unsustainable practices that ignore basic biology and the needs of ecosystems. Many of Fukuoka&#x27;s principles are now being incorporated into modern forms of farming that are more biodiverse, less reliant on chemicals and machines, and which produce similar yields while increasing the health of the soil and surrounding environment. In particular, the concepts of non-tillage, relay cropping, cover-cropping, and plant biodiversity have been shown to prevent soil loss, reduce or eliminate the need for pesticides or fertilizers, and reduce flooding, while increasing water retention, and providing habitat for insects that contribute positively to both crop and ecosystem health.

In Japan, where Fukuoka had few followers or associates, his critics argue that the &quot;inner world and the connection between humans and nature does not, however, exhaust reality&quot; and that he did not give sufficient attention to interpersonal relationships or society. These criticisms were in some ways addressed by the next generation of natural farmers in Japan such as Yoshikazu Kawaguchi, who started a movement of widespread free schools, and yearly conferences to help spread the mindset of natural farming. There are now over 40 learning sites and more than 900 concurrent students in the Japanese natural farming network.

==Family farm recent developments==
Fukuoka&#x27;s farm in Shikoku was taken over by his son and daughter-in-law in the late 1980s, as Fukuoka reached an advanced age. His grandson also took up farming. Many of the farm&#x27;s iyokan and amanatsu mikan trees remain, although some old iyokan were replaced by new varieties of fruit. Woodlands remain along with orchards, including some areas of wild vegetables still growing amongst them. Some areas of straw-mulched cropping continue to produce grains and vegetables. The farm also features an orchard area of ginkgo trees, shiitake mushroom crops growing on tree logs in shady woodland, and plantings of limes, grapefruits, feijoas, avocados and mangoes.

The farm is now run using some natural farming techniques: no chemicals, no tillage of the land and no use of composting. Other techniques have been changed; the pattern of irrigation is more conventional to reduce conflicts with neighbours. A do-nothing philosophy has been followed on the hilltop surrounding Fukuoka&#x27;s hut. Here it has become a natural, fruit-bearing forest with minimal intervention.

The genus name &quot;Marrubium&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;marrubii&quot;, meaning horehound. The French Talmudic exegete, Rashi, thinks that this herb may have been used as one of the bitter herbs on the night of Passover. The common English name horehound is of unknown origin, but with the first part &#x27;hore&#x27; derived from &quot;hoary&quot;, &quot;hairy&quot;.

The species formerly classified as &quot;Marrubium nigrum&quot; (Black Horehound) is now placed in the genus &quot;Ballota&quot;.

&quot;Marrubium&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora lineolea&quot;.

<text>Hyperglycemia or hyperglycaemia is a condition where unusually high amount of glucose is present in blood. It is defined as blood glucose level exceeding 6.9 mmol/L (125 mg/dL) after fasting for 8 hours and 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) 2 hours after eating.

==Blood glucose level indication==

Postprandial hyperglycemic levels as high as 8.6 mmol/L (155 mg/dL) at 1-h are associated with T2DM-related complications, which worsen as the degree of hyperglycemia increases. Patients with diabetes are oriented to avoid exceeding the recommended postprandial threshold of 160 mg/dL (8.89 mmol/L) for optimal glycemic control. Values of blood glucose higher than 160 mg/dL are classified as &#x27;very high&#x27; hyperglycemia, a condition in which an excessive amount of glucose (glucotoxicity) circulates in the blood plasma. These values are higher than the renal threshold of 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) up to which glucose reabsorption is preserved at physiological rates and insulin therapy is not necessary. Blood glucose values higher than the cutoff level of 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) are used to diagnose T2DM and strongly associated with metabolic disturbances, although symptoms may not start to become noticeable until even higher values such as 13.9–16.7 mmol/L (~250–300 mg/dL). A subject with a consistent fasting blood glucose range between 5.6–7 mmol/L (~100–126 mg/dL) (American Diabetes Association guidelines) is considered slightly hyperglycemic, and above 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) is generally held to have diabetes. For diabetics, glucose levels that are considered to be too hyperglycemic can vary from person to person, mainly due to the person&#x27;s renal threshold of glucose and overall glucose tolerance. On average, however, chronic levels above 10–12 mmol/L (180–216 mg/dL) can produce noticeable organ damage over time.

==Signs and symptoms==
The degree of hyperglycemia can change over time depending on the metabolic cause, for example, impaired glucose tolerance or fasting glucose, and it can depend on treatment. Temporary hyperglycemia is often benign and asymptomatic. Blood glucose levels can rise well above normal and cause pathological and functional changes for significant periods without producing any permanent effects or symptoms. During this asymptomatic period, an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism can occur, which can be tested by measuring plasma glucose. Chronic hyperglycemia at above normal levels can produce a very wide variety of serious complications over a period of years, including kidney damage, neurological damage, cardiovascular damage, damage to the retina or damage to feet and legs. Diabetic neuropathy may be a result of long-term hyperglycemia. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections can occur as a result of chronic hyperglycemia.

Acute hyperglycemia involving glucose levels that are extremely high is a medical emergency and can rapidly produce serious complications (such as fluid loss through osmotic diuresis). It is most often seen in persons who have uncontrolled insulin-dependent diabetes.

The following symptoms may be associated with acute or chronic hyperglycemia, with the first three composing the classic hyperglycemic triad:
* Polyphagia – frequent hunger, especially pronounced hunger
* Polydipsia – frequent thirst, especially excessive thirst
* Polyuria – increased volume of urination (&quot;not&quot; an increased frequency, although it is a common consequence)
* Blurred vision
* Fatigue
* Restlessness
* Weight loss or weight gain
* Poor wound healing (cuts, scrapes, etc.)
* Dry mouth
* Dry or itchy skin
* Tingling in feet or heels
* Erectile dysfunction
* Recurrent infections, external ear infections (swimmer&#x27;s ear)
* Delayed gastric emptying
* Cardiac arrhythmia
* Stupor
* Coma
* Seizures

Frequent hunger without other symptoms can also indicate that blood sugar levels are too low. This may occur when people who have diabetes take too much oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin for the amount of food they eat. The resulting drop in blood sugar level to below the normal range prompts a hunger response.

Polydipsia and polyuria occur when blood glucose levels rise high enough to result in excretion of excess glucose via the kidneys, which leads to the presence of glucose in the urine. This produces an osmotic diuresis.

Signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis may include:
* Ketoacidosis
* Kussmaul breathing (deep, rapid breathing)
* Confusion or a decreased level of consciousness
* Dehydration due to glycosuria and osmotic diuresis
* Increased thirst
* &#x27;Fruity&#x27; smelling breath odor
* Sweet sensation that is felt into the mouth without a reason
* Nausea and vomiting
* Abdominal pain
* Impairment of cognitive function, along with increased sadness and anxiety
* Weight loss

Hyperglycemia causes a decrease in cognitive performance, specifically in processing speed, executive function, and performance. Decreased cognitive performance may cause forgetfulness and concentration loss.

===Complications===
In untreated hyperglycemia, a condition called ketoacidosis may develop because decreased insulin levels increase the activity of hormone sensitive lipase. The degradation of triacylglycerides by hormone-sensitive lipase produces free fatty acids that are eventually converted to acetyl-coA by beta-oxidation.

Ketoacidosis is a life-threatening condition which requires immediate treatment. Symptoms include: shortness of breath, breath that smells fruity (such as pear drops), nausea and vomiting, and very dry mouth.
Chronic hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) injures the heart in patients without a history of heart disease or diabetes and is strongly associated with heart attacks and death in subjects with no coronary heart disease or history of heart failure.

Also, a life-threatening consequence of hyperglycemia can be nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome.

Perioperative hyperglycemia has been associated with immunosuppression, increased infections, osmotic diuresis, delayed wound healing, delayed gastric emptying, sympatho-adrenergic stimulation, and increased mortality. In addition, it reduces skin graft success, exacerbates brain, spinal cord, and renal damage by ischemia, worsens neurologic outcomes in traumatic head injuries, and is associated with postoperative cognitive dysfunction following CABG.

Furthermore, hyperglycemia has been linked to increased susceptibility to a range of infectious diseases. This susceptibility can be attributed to the impairment of the immune system&#x27;s response, which is often compromised in hyperglycemic conditions. Hyperglycemia also leads to biochemical changes in the body; both of these factors result in increased severity of respiratory infections and vulnerability to pathogens. Hyperglycemic individuals face the most pronounced risk from such types of ailments, including tuberculosis, the flu, and COVID-19. These risks can be compounded even further by the effects of physiological stress.

Importantly, hyperglycemia affects the function of neutrophils, which are white blood cells responsible for responding to infection. In hyperglycemic individuals, the ability for neutrophils to move toward infection sites, ingest bacteria, and kill them are often impaired, leading to reduced effectiveness in combating infections.

Hyperglycemia also creates microbiological changes within the body: hyperglycemia can lead to rapid changes in blood pH and cell viscosity, weakening the cells and making it more conducive for infectious agents to thrive and dampen inflammatory responses. This is because hyperglycemia impacts a few factors such as microenvironment of immune cells, or even bacteria&#x27;s supply of energy, adding on stress to the bacterial proliferation metabolism.

The chronic inflammatory state induced by high glucose levels can also lead to dysfunction in various parts of the immune system. For example, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are more prevalent in hyperglycemic conditions, can interfere with the normal function of the immune system and contribute to the pathogenesis of infections. AGEs, whose cross-links are permanent will continue to harm the surrounding tissue until the proteins are destroyed. In addition, they can interact with the RAGE receptor to cause oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation.

Due to neutrophil changes, microbiological changes, and chronic inflammation, patients with hyperglycemia are thus more prone to severe respiratory infections. This increased risk is particularly pronounced with pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis) and the flu. In recent history, hyperglycemic individuals have also responded more severely to the symptoms of COVID-19. Another example is diabetes. Hyperglycemia and risk of severe infectious outcomes can even further be complicated by physiological stress. For instance, elevated blood glucose levels can actively contribute to pathophysiology of this disease, by exacerbating existing inflammation, impairing cellular immune responses, and increasing oxidative stress, which can also lead to more severe infection. In addition, patients with acute hyperglycemia who don&#x27;t have a history of diabetes can experience higher rates of mortality and complications.

==Causes==
Hyperglycemia may be caused by: diabetes, various (non-diabetic) endocrine disorders (insulin resistance and thyroid, adrenal, pancreatic, and pituitary disorders), sepsis and certain infections, intracranial diseases (e.g. encephalitis, brain tumors (especially if near the pituitary gland), brain haemorrhages, and meningitis) (frequently overlooked), convulsions, end-stage terminal disease, prolonged/major surgeries, stress, and excessive eating of carbohydrates.

===Endocrine===
Chronic, persistent hyperglycaemia is most often a result of diabetes. Several hormones act to increase blood glucose levels and may thus cause hyperglycaemia when present in excess, including: cortisol, catecholamines, growth hormone, glucagon, and thyroid hormones. Hyperglycaemia may thus be seen in: Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, pheochromocytoma, acromegaly, hyperglucagonemia, and hyperthyroidism.

====Diabetes mellitus====
Chronic hyperglycemia that persists even in fasting states is most commonly caused by diabetes mellitus. In fact, chronic hyperglycemia is the defining characteristic of the disease. Intermittent hyperglycemia may be present in prediabetic states. Acute episodes of hyperglycemia without an obvious cause may indicate developing diabetes or a predisposition to the disorder.

In diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia is usually caused by low insulin levels (diabetes mellitus type 1) and/or by resistance to insulin at the cellular level (diabetes mellitus type 2), depending on the type and state of the disease. Low insulin levels and/or insulin resistance prevent the body from converting glucose into glycogen (a starch-like source of energy stored mostly in the liver), which in turn makes it difficult or impossible to remove excess glucose from the blood. With normal glucose levels, the total amount of glucose in the blood at any given moment is only enough to provide energy to the body for 20–30 minutes, and so glucose levels must be precisely maintained by the body&#x27;s internal control mechanisms. When the mechanisms fail in a way that allows glucose to rise to abnormal levels, hyperglycemia is the result.

Ketoacidosis may be the first symptom of immune-mediated diabetes, particularly in children and adolescents. Also, patients with immune-mediated diabetes can change from modest fasting hyperglycemia to severe hyperglycemia and even ketoacidosis as a result of stress or an infection.

====Insulin resistance====
Obesity has been contributing to increased insulin resistance in the global population. Insulin resistance increases hyperglycemia because the body becomes over saturated by glucose. Insulin resistance desensitizes insulin receptors, preventing insulin from lowering blood sugar levels.

The leading cause of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is the failure of insulin to suppress glucose production by glycolysis and gluconeogenesis due to insulin resistance. Insulin normally inhibits glycogenolysis, but fails to do so in a condition of insulin resistance, resulting in increased glucose production. In the liver, FOXO6 normally promotes gluconeogenesis in the fasted state, but insulin blocks Fox06 upon feeding. In a condition of insulin resistance insulin fails to block Fox06, resulting in continued gluconeogenesis even upon feeding.

===Medications===
Certain medications increase the risk of hyperglycemia, including: corticosteroids, octreotide, beta blockers, epinephrine, thiazide diuretics, statins, niacin, pentamidine, protease inhibitors, L-asparaginase, and antipsychotics. The administration of amphetamines initially produces hyperglycemia but later produces hypoglycemia.

Thiazides are used to treat hypertension in type 2 diabetes but also may cause hyperglycemia.

===Stress===
A high proportion of patients with an acute stress such as stroke or myocardial infarction may develop hyperglycemia, even in the absence of a diagnosis of diabetes. Human and animal studies suggest that this is not benign, and that stress-induced hyperglycemia is associated with a high risk of mortality after both stroke and myocardial infarction. Somatostatinomas and aldosteronoma-induced hypokalemia can cause hyperglycemia but usually disappears after the removal of the tumour.

Stress causes hyperglycaemia via several mechanisms, including through metabolic and hormonal changes, and via increased proinflammatory cytokines that interrupt carbohydrate metabolism, leading to excessive glucose production and reduced uptake in tissues, can cause hyperglycemia.

Hormones such as the growth hormone, glucagon, cortisol, and catecholamines, can cause hyperglycemia when they are present in the body in excess amounts.

==Diagnosis==

===Monitoring===
It is critical for patients who monitor glucose levels at home to be aware of which units of measurement their glucose meter uses.

Glucose levels are measured in either:
# Millimoles per liter (mmol/L) is the SI standard unit used in most countries around the world.
# Milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) is used in some countries such as the United States, Japan, France, Egypt, and Colombia.

Scientific journals are moving toward using mmol/L; some journals now use mmol/L as the primary unit but quote mg/dL in parentheses.

Glucose levels vary before and after meals, and at various times of day; the definition of &quot;normal&quot; varies among medical professionals. In general, the normal range for most people (fasting adults) is about 4 to 6 mmol/L or 80 to 110 mg/dL. (where 4 mmol/L or 80 mg/dL is &quot;optimal&quot;.) A subject with a consistent range above 7 mmol/L or 126 mg/dL is generally held to have hyperglycemia, whereas a consistent range below 4 mmol/L or 70 mg/dL is considered hypoglycemic. In fasting adults, blood plasma glucose should not exceed 7 mmol/L or 126 mg/dL. Sustained higher levels of blood sugar cause damage to the blood vessels and to the organs they supply, leading to the complications of diabetes.

Chronic hyperglycemia can be measured via the HbA1c test. The definition of acute hyperglycemia varies by study, with mmol/L levels from 8 to 15 (mg/dL levels from 144 to 270).

Defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both, results in hyperglycemia.

Chronic hyperglycemia can be measured by clinical urine tests which can detect sugar in the urine or microalbuminuria which could be a symptom of diabetes.
==Treatment==
Treatment of hyperglycemia requires elimination of the underlying cause, such as diabetes. Acute hyperglycemia can be treated by direct administration of insulin in most cases and may be lessened by the intake of some natural compounds. For example, a single dose of raw cinnamon before a meal containing complex carbohydrates decreases the postprandial hyperglycemia (higher than 140 mg/dL; &gt;7.8 mmol/L) in patients with type II diabetes. Severe hyperglycemia can be treated with oral hypoglycemic therapy and lifestyle modification.
In diabetes mellitus (by far the most common cause of chronic hyperglycemia), treatment aims at maintaining blood glucose at a level as close to normal as possible, in order to avoid serious long-term complications. This is done by a combination of proper diet, regular exercise, and insulin or other medication such as metformin, etc.

Those with hyperglycaemia can be treated using sulphonylureas or metformin or both. These drugs help by improving glycaemic control. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor alone or in combination with basal insulin can be used as a treatment for hyperglycemia with patients still in hospital.

Hyperglycemia can also be improved through minor lifestyle changes. Increasing aerobic exercise to at least 30 minutes a day causes the body to make better use of accumulated glucose since the glucose is being converted to energy by the muscles. Calorie monitoring, with restriction as necessary, can reduce over-eating, which contributes to hyperglycemia.

Diets higher in healthy unsaturated fats and whole-wheat carbohydrates such as the Mediterranean diet can help reduce carbohydrate intake to better control hyperglycemia. Diets such as intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet help reduce calorie consumption which could significantly reduce hyperglycemia.

Carbohydrates are the main cause for hyperglycemia. Non-whole-wheat items should be substituted by whole-wheat items. Although fruits can be nutritious, fruit intake should be limited due to high sugar content.

==Epidemiology==

===Environmental factors===
Hyperglycemia is lower in higher income groups since there is access to better education, healthcare, and resources. Low-middle income groups are more likely to develop hyperglycemia, due in part to a limited access to education and a reduced availability of healthy food options. Living in warmer climates can reduce hyperglycemia due to increased physical activity while people are less active in colder climates.

===Population===
Hyperglycemia is one of the main symptoms of diabetes and it has substantially affected the population making it an epidemic due to the population&#x27;s increased calorie consumption. Healthcare providers are trying to work more closely with people allowing them more freedom with interventions that suit their lifestyle. As physical inactivity and calorie consumption increases it makes individuals more susceptible to developing hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is caused by type 1 diabetes and non-whites have a higher susceptibility for it.

==Etymology==
The origin of the term is Greek: prefix ὑπέρ- &quot;hyper-&quot; &quot;over-&quot;, γλυκός &quot;glycos&quot; &quot;sweet wine, must&quot;, αἷμα &quot;haima&quot; &quot;blood&quot;, -ία, -εια &quot;-ia&quot; suffix for abstract nouns of feminine gender.

<text>The thalamus (: thalami; from Greek , &quot;chamber&quot;) is a large mass of gray matter on the lateral walls of the third ventricle forming the part of the diencephalon (a division of the forebrain). Nerve fibers project out of the thalamus to the cerebral cortex in all directions, known as the thalamocortical radiations, allowing hub-like exchanges of information. It has several functions, such as the relaying of sensory and motor signals to the cerebral cortex and the regulation of consciousness, sleep, and alertness.

Anatomically, it is a paramedian symmetrical structure of two halves (left and right), within the vertebrate brain, situated between the cerebral cortex and the midbrain. It forms during embryonic development as the main product of the diencephalon, as first recognized by the Swiss embryologist and anatomist Wilhelm His Sr. in 1893.

==Anatomy==
The thalamus is a paired structure of gray matter about four centimetres long, located in the forebrain which is superior to the midbrain, near the center of the brain with nerve fibers projecting out to the cerebral cortex in all directions. In fact, almost all thalamic neurons (with the notable exception of the thalamic reticular nucleus) project to the cerebral cortex, and every region of the cortex so far studied has been found to innervate the thalamus.

Each of the thalami may be subdivided into at least 30 nuclei, giving a total of at least 60 for the whole thalamus.

Estimates of the volume of the whole thalamus vary. A post-mortem study of 10 people with average age 71 years found average volume 13.68 cmformula_1. In a study of 12 healthy males with average age 17 years, MRI scans showed mean whole thalamus volume 8.68cmformula_1.

The medial surface of the thalamus constitutes the upper part of the lateral wall of the third ventricle, and is connected to the corresponding surface of the opposite thalamus by a flattened gray band, the interthalamic adhesion.

The lateral part of the thalamus is the neothalamus, the phylogenetically newest part of the thalamus, which includes the lateral nuclei, the pulvinar nuclei and the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei.

The surface of the thalamus is covered by two layers of white matter, the &quot;stratum zonale&quot; covers the dorsal surface, and the external medullary lamina covers the lateral surface. (This stratum zonale should not be confused with the stratum zonale of the superior colliculus.) Within the thalamus the internal medullary lamina divides the nuclei into anterior, medial, and lateral groups.

Derivatives of the diencephalon include the dorsally-located epithalamus (essentially the habenula and annexes) and the perithalamus (prethalamus) containing the zona incerta and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Due to their different ontogenetic origins, the epithalamus and the perithalamus are formally distinguished from the thalamus proper. The metathalamus is made up of the lateral geniculate and medial geniculate nuclei.

The thalamus comprises a system of lamellae (made up of myelinated fibers) that separate different thalamic subparts. Other areas are defined by distinct clusters of neurons, such as the periventricular nucleus, the intralaminar elements, the &quot;nucleus limitans&quot;, and others. These latter structures, different in structure from the major part of the thalamus, have been grouped together into the &quot;allothalamus&quot; as opposed to the &quot;isothalamus&quot;. This distinction simplifies the global description of the thalamus.


=== Thalamic nuclei ===


The principal subdivision of the thalamus into nucleus groups is the trisection of each thalamus (left and right) by a Y-shaped internal medullary lamina. This trisection divides each thalamus into anterior, medial and lateral groups of nuclei. The medial group is subdivided into the medial dorsal nucleus and midline group. The lateral group is subdivided into ventral, pulvinar, lateral dorsal, lateral posterior and metathalamus. The ventral group is further subdivided into ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral posterior.

The interior medullary lamina is subdivided into intralaminar nuclei. Additional structures are the reticular nucleus (which envelops the lateral thalamus), the stratum zonale, and the interthalamic adhesion.

Combining these division principles yields the following hierarchy, which is subject to many further subdivisions.
* anterior group
* medial group
** medial dorsal nucleus
** midline group
* lateral group
** ventral group
*** ventral anterior group
*** ventral lateral group
*** ventral posterior group
** pulvinar group
** lateral dorsal nucleus
** lateral posterior nucleus
** metathalamus
*** lateral geniculate nucleus
*** medial geniculate nucleus
* intralaminar group
* reticular nucleus
* stratum zonale
* interthalamic adhesion

The term &quot;lateral nuclear group&quot; is used with two meanings. It can mean either the complete set of nuclei in the lateral &quot;third&quot; of the trisection by the lamina, or the subset which excludes the ventral group and the geniculate nuclei.

=== Blood supply ===
The thalamus derives its blood supply from a number of arteries: the polar artery (posterior communicating artery), paramedian thalamic-subthalamic arteries, inferolateral (thalamogeniculate) arteries, and posterior (medial and lateral) choroidal arteries. These are all branches of the posterior cerebral artery.

Some people have the artery of Percheron, which is a rare anatomic variation in which a single arterial trunk arises from the posterior cerebral artery to supply both parts of the thalamus.

=== Connections ===
The thalamus has many connections to the hippocampus via the mammillothalamic tract. This tract comprises the mammillary bodies and fornix.

The thalamus is connected to the cerebral cortex via the thalamocortical radiations.

The spinothalamic tract is a sensory pathway originating in the spinal cord. It transmits information to the thalamus about pain, temperature, itch and crude touch. There are two main parts: the lateral spinothalamic tract, which transmits pain and temperature, and the anterior (or ventral) spinothalamic tract, which transmits crude touch and pressure.

== Function ==
The thalamus has multiple functions, and is generally believed to act as a relay station, or hub, relaying information between different subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. In particular, every sensory system (with the exception of the olfactory system) includes a thalamic nucleus that receives sensory signals and sends them to the associated primary cortical area.

For the visual system, for example, inputs from the retina are sent to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, which in turn projects to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Similarly the medial geniculate nucleus acts as a key auditory relay between the inferior colliculus of the midbrain and the primary auditory cortex. The ventral posterior nucleus is a key somatosensory relay, which sends touch and proprioceptive information to the primary somatosensory cortex. In rodents, proprioceptive information of head and whisker movements is integrated already at the thalamic level.

The thalamus is believed to both process sensory information as well as relay it—each of the primary sensory relay areas receives strong feedback connections from the cerebral cortex.

The thalamus also plays an important role in regulating states of sleep, and wakefulness. Thalamic nuclei have strong reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex, forming thalamo-cortico-thalamic circuits that are believed to be involved with consciousness. The thalamus plays a major role in regulating arousal, the level of awareness, and activity. Damage to the thalamus can lead to permanent coma.

The role of the thalamus in the more anterior pallidal and nigral territories in the basal ganglia system disturbances is recognized but still poorly understood. The contribution of the thalamus to vestibular or to tectal functions is almost ignored. The thalamus has been thought of as a &quot;relay&quot; that simply forwards signals to the cerebral cortex. Newer research suggests that thalamic function is more selective. Many different functions are linked to various regions of the thalamus. This is the case for many of the sensory systems (except for the olfactory system), such as the auditory, somatic, visceral, gustatory and visual systems where localized lesions provoke specific sensory deficits. A major role of the thalamus is support of motor and language systems, and much of the circuitry implicated for these systems is shared.

The thalamus is &quot;functionally connected&quot; to the hippocampus as part of the extended hippocampal system at the thalamic anterior nuclei. With respect to spatial memory and spatial sensory datum they are crucial for human episodic event memory. The thalamic region&#x27;s connection to the medial temporal lobe provides differentiation of the functioning of recollective and familiarity memory.

The neuronal information processes necessary for motor control were proposed as a network involving the thalamus as a subcortical motor center. Through investigations of the anatomy of the brains of primates the nature of the interconnected tissues of the cerebellum to the multiple motor cortices suggested that the thalamus fulfills a key function in providing the specific channels from the basal ganglia and cerebellum to the cortical motor areas. In an investigation of the saccade and antisaccade motor response in three monkeys, the thalamic regions were found to be involved in the generation of antisaccade eye-movement (that is, the ability to inhibit the reflexive jerking movement of the eyes in the direction of a presented stimulus).

Recent research suggests that the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) may play a broader role in cognition. Specifically, the mediodorsal thalamus may &quot;amplify the connectivity (signaling strength) of just the circuits in the cortex appropriate for the current context and thereby contribute to the flexibility (of the mammalian brain) to make complex decisions by wiring the many associations on which decisions depend into weakly connected cortical circuits.&quot; Researchers found that &quot;enhancing MD activity magnified the ability of mice to &quot;think,&quot; driving down by more than 25 percent their error rate in deciding which conflicting sensory stimuli to follow to find the reward.&quot;

== Development ==
The thalamic complex is composed of the perithalamus (or prethalamus, previously also known as ventral thalamus), the mid-diencephalic organiser (which forms later the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI) ) and the thalamus (dorsal thalamus). The development of the thalamus can be subdivided into three steps.
The thalamus is the largest structure deriving from the embryonic diencephalon, the posterior part of the forebrain situated between the midbrain and the cerebrum.

===Early brain development===
After neurulation, the early developmental stage (primordium) of the prethalamus and the thalamus is induced within the neural tube. Data from different vertebrate model organisms support a model in which the interaction between two transcription factors, Fez and Otx, is of decisive importance. Fez is expressed in the prethalamus, and functional experiments show that Fez is required for prethalamus formation. Posteriorly, OTX1 and OTX2 abut the expression domain of Fez and are required for proper development of the thalamus.

=== Formation of progenitor domains ===
Early in thalamic development two progenitor domains form, a caudal domain, and a rostral domain. The caudal domain gives rise to all of the glutamatergic neurons in the adult thalamus while the rostral domain gives rise to all of the GABAergic neurons in the adult thalamus.

===The formation of the mid-diencephalic organiser (MDO)===
At the interface between the expression domains of Fez and Otx, the mid-diencephalic organizer (MDO, also called the ZLI organiser) is induced within the thalamic anlage. The MDO is the central signalling organizer in the thalamus. A lack of the organizer leads to the absence of the thalamus. The MDO matures from ventral to dorsal during development. Members of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) family and of the Wnt family are the main principal signals emitted by the MDO.

Besides its importance as signalling center, the organizer matures into the morphological structure of the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI).

===Maturation and parcellation of the thalamus===
After its induction, the MDO starts to orchestrate the development of the thalamic anlage by release of signalling molecules such as SHH. In mice, the function of signaling at the MDO has not been addressed directly due to a complete absence of the diencephalon in SHH mutants.

Studies in chicks have shown that SHH is both necessary and sufficient for thalamic gene induction. In zebrafish, it was shown that the expression of two SHH genes, SHH-a and SHH-b (formerly described as twhh) mark the MDO territory, and that SHH signaling is sufficient for the molecular differentiation of both the prethalamus and the thalamus but is not required for their maintenance and SHH signaling from the MDO/alar plate is sufficient for the maturation of prethalamic and thalamic territory while ventral Shh signals are dispensable.

The exposure to SHH leads to differentiation of thalamic neurons. SHH signaling from the MDO induces a posterior-to-anterior wave of expression the proneural gene Neurogenin1 in the major (caudal) part of the thalamus, and Ascl1 (formerly Mash1) in the remaining narrow stripe of rostral thalamic cells immediately adjacent to the MDO, and in the prethalamus.

This zonation of proneural gene expression leads to the differentiation of glutamatergic relay neurons from the Neurogenin1+ precursors and of GABAergic inhibitory neurons from the Ascl1+ precursors. In fish, selection of these alternative neurotransmitter fates is controlled by the dynamic expression of Her6 the homolog of HES1. Expression of this hairy-like bHLH transcription factor, which represses Neurogenin but is required for Ascl1, is progressively lost from the caudal thalamus but maintained in the prethalamus and in the stripe of rostral thalamic cells. In addition, studies on chick and mice have shown that blocking the Shh pathway leads to absence of the rostral thalamus and substantial decrease of the caudal thalamus. The rostral thalamus will give rise to the reticular nucleus mainly whereby the caudal thalamus will form the relay thalamus and will be further subdivided in the thalamic nuclei.

In humans, a common genetic variation in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (the SERT-long and -short allele: 5-HTTLPR) has been shown to affect the development of several regions of the thalamus in adults. People who inherit two short alleles (SERT-ss) have more neurons and a larger volume in the pulvinar and possibly the limbic regions of the thalamus. Enlargement of the thalamus provides an anatomical basis for why people who inherit two SERT-ss alleles are more vulnerable to major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide.

== Clinical significance==
A thalamus damaged by a stroke can lead to thalamic pain syndrome, which involves a one-sided burning or aching sensation often accompanied by mood swings. Bilateral ischemia of the area supplied by the paramedian artery can cause serious problems including akinetic mutism, and be accompanied by oculomotor problems. A related concept is thalamocortical dysrhythmia. The occlusion of the artery of Percheron can lead to a bilateral thalamus infarction.

Korsakoff syndrome stems from damage to the mammillary body, the mammillothalamic fasciculus or the thalamus.

Fatal familial insomnia is a hereditary prion disease in which degeneration of the thalamus occurs, causing the patient to gradually lose their ability to sleep and progressing to a state of total insomnia, which invariably leads to death. In contrast, damage to the thalamus can result in coma.

Atrophy of the thalamus is an indicator of the start of multiple sclerosis. Thalamic volume loss by atrophy, is also significantly shown in sporadic frontotemporal dementia, noted in the anterior-dorsal thickness.

Microstimulation of the posterior portion of the ventral medial thalamic nucleus can be used to evoke pain, temperature and visceral sensations.

<text>Lionel Leo Hampton (April 20, 1908 – August 31, 2002) was an American jazz vibraphonist, percussionist, and bandleader. He worked with jazz musicians from Teddy Wilson, Benny Goodman, and Buddy Rich, to Charlie Parker, Charles Mingus, and Quincy Jones. In 1992, he was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame, and he was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 1996.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lionel Hampton was born in 1908 in Louisville, Kentucky, and was raised by his mother. Shortly after he was born, he and his mother moved to her hometown of Birmingham, Alabama. He spent his early childhood in Kenosha, Wisconsin, before he and his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1916. As a youth, Hampton was a member of the Bud Billiken Club, an alternative to the Boy Scouts of America, which was off-limits because of racial segregation. 

During the 1920s, while still a teenager, Hampton took xylophone lessons from Jimmy Bertrand and began to play drums. Hampton was raised Catholic, and started out playing fife and drum at the Holy Rosary Academy near Chicago.

===Early career===
Lionel Hampton began his career playing drums for the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; Newsboys&#x27; Band (led by Major N. Clark Smith) while still a teenager in Chicago. While he lived in Chicago, Hampton saw Louis Armstrong at the Vendome, recalling that the entire audience went crazy after his first solo. 

He moved to California in 1927 or 1928, playing drums for the Dixieland Blues-Blowers. He made his recording debut with The Quality Serenaders led by Paul Howard, then left for Culver City and drummed for the Les Hite band at Sebastian&#x27;s Cotton Club. One of his trademarks as a drummer was his ability to do stunts with multiple pairs of sticks such as twirling and juggling without missing a beat. 

During this period, he began practicing on the vibraphone. In 1930 Louis Armstrong came to California and hired the Les Hite band for performances and recordings. Armstrong was impressed with Hampton&#x27;s playing after Hampton reproduced Armstrong&#x27;s solo on the vibraphone and asked him to play behind him like that during vocal choruses. So began his career as a vibraphonist, popularizing the use of the instrument in the process.

While working with the Les Hite band, Hampton also occasionally did some performing with Nat Shilkret and his orchestra. During the early 1930s, he studied music at the University of Southern California. In 1934 he led his own orchestra, and then appeared in the Bing Crosby film &quot;Pennies From Heaven&quot; (1936) alongside Louis Armstrong (wearing a mask in a scene while playing drums).

===With Benny Goodman===
Also in November 1936, the Benny Goodman Orchestra came to Los Angeles to play the Palomar Ballroom. When John Hammond brought Goodman to see Hampton perform, Goodman invited him to join his trio, which soon became the Benny Goodman Quartet with pianist Teddy Wilson and drummer Gene Krupa completing the lineup. The Trio and Quartet were among the first racially integrated jazz groups to perform before audiences, and were a leading small group of the day.

===Lionel Hampton Orchestra===

While Hampton worked for Goodman in New York, he recorded with several different small groups known as the Lionel Hampton Orchestra, as well as assorted small groups within the Goodman band. In 1940 Hampton left the Goodman organization under amicable circumstances to form his own big band.

Hampton&#x27;s orchestra developed a high profile during the 1940s and early 1950s. His third recording with them in 1942 produced the version of &quot;Flying Home&quot;, featuring a solo by Illinois Jacquet that anticipated rhythm &amp; blues. Although Hampton first recorded &quot;Flying Home&quot; under his own name with a small group in 1940 for Victor, the best known version is the big band version recorded for Decca on May 26, 1942, in a new arrangement by Hampton&#x27;s pianist Milt Buckner. The 78 RPM disc became successful enough for Hampton to record &quot;Flyin&#x27; Home #2&quot; in 1944, this time a feature for Arnett Cobb. The song went on to become the theme song for all three men. 

Guitarist Billy Mackel first joined Hampton in 1944, and would perform and record with him almost continuously through to the late 1970s. In 1947, Hamp performed &quot;Stardust&quot; at a &quot;Just Jazz&quot; concert for producer Gene Norman, also featuring Charlie Shavers and Slam Stewart; the recording was issued by Decca. Later, Norman&#x27;s GNP Crescendo label issued the remaining tracks from the concert.

Hampton was a featured artist at numerous Cavalcade of Jazz concerts held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles and produced by Leon Hefflin Sr. His first performance was at the second Cavalcade of Jazz concert held on October 12, 1946, and also featured Jack McVea, Slim Gaillard, T-Bone Walker, the Honeydrippers and Louis Armstrong. 

The fifth Cavalcade of Jazz concert was held in two locations, Wrigley Field in Los Angeles and Lane Field in San Diego, July 10, 1949, and September 3, 1949, respectively. Betty Carter, Jimmy Witherspoon, Buddy Banks, Smiley Turner and Big Jay McNeely also played with Hampton. 

It was at the sixth Cavalcade of Jazz, June 25, 1950, that Hampton&#x27;s playing precipitated the closest thing to a riot in the show&#x27;s eventful history. Lionel and his band paraded around the ball park&#x27;s infield playing ‘Flying High’. The huge crowd, around 14,000, went berserk, tossed cushions, coats, hats, programs, and just about anything else they could lay hands on and swarmed on the field. Dinah Washington, Roy Milton, PeeWee Crayton, Lillie Greenwood, Tiny Davis and Her Hell Divers were also featured. 

His final Cavalcade of Jazz concert held on July 24, 1955 (Eleventh) also featured Big Jay McNeely, The Medallions, The Penguins and James Moody and his Orchestra.

From the mid-1940s until the early 1950s, Hampton led a lively rhythm &amp; blues band whose Decca Records recordings included numerous young performers who later had significant careers. They included bassist Charles Mingus, saxophonist Johnny Griffin, guitarist Wes Montgomery, vocalist Dinah Washington, and vocal stylist &quot;Little&quot; Jimmy Scott. Other noteworthy band members were trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Cat Anderson, Kenny Dorham, and Snooky Young, trombonist Jimmy Cleveland, and saxophonists Jerome Richardson and Curtis Lowe.

The Hampton orchestra that toured Europe in 1953 included Clifford Brown, Gigi Gryce, Anthony Ortega, Monk Montgomery, George Wallington, Art Farmer, Quincy Jones, and singer Annie Ross. Hampton continued to record with small groups and jam sessions during the 1940s and 1950s, with Oscar Peterson, Buddy DeFranco, and others. In 1955, while in California working on &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot; he recorded with Stan Getz and made two albums with Art Tatum for Norman Granz as well as with his own big band.

Hampton performed with Louis Armstrong and Italian singer Lara Saint Paul at the 1968 Sanremo Music Festival in Italy. The performance created a sensation with Italian audiences, as it broke into a real jazz session. That same year, Hampton received a Papal Medal from Pope Paul VI.

===Later career===

During the 1960s, Hampton&#x27;s groups were in decline; he was still performing what had succeeded for him earlier in his career. He did not fare much better in the 1970s, though he recorded actively for his Who&#x27;s Who in Jazz record label, which he founded in 1977/1978.

Beginning in February 1984, Hampton and his band played at the University of Idaho&#x27;s annual jazz festival, which was renamed the Lionel Hampton Jazz Festival the following year. In 1987, the UI&#x27;s school of music was renamed for Hampton, the first university music school named for a jazz musician.

During much of the 1980s, some notable sidemen in Hampton&#x27;s orchestra included Thomas Chapin, Paul Jeffrey, Frankie Dunlop, Arvell Shaw, John Colianni, Oliver Jackson and George Duvivier. Hampton remained active until a stroke in Paris in 1991 led to a collapse on stage. That incident, combined with years of chronic arthritis, forced him to cut back drastically on performances. However, he did play at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in 2001 shortly before his death. On April 15, 2002, the United States Congress celebrated Hampton&#x27;s life and &quot;resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That the Congress, on behalf of the American people, extends its birthday greetings and best wishes to Lionel Hampton on the occasion of his 94th birthday.&quot;

Hampton died from congestive heart failure at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York City, on August 31, 2002. He was interred at the Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York. His funeral was held on September 7, 2002, and featured a performance by Wynton Marsalis and David Ostwald&#x27;s Gully Low Jazz Band at Riverside Church in Manhattan; the procession began at The Cotton Club in Harlem. Speakers at his funeral included U.S. representatives Charles Rangel and John Conyers and former President George H. W. Bush.

==Personal life==

On November 11, 1936, in Yuma, Arizona, Lionel Hampton married Gladys Riddle (1913–1971). Gladys was Lionel&#x27;s business manager throughout much of his career. Many musicians recall that Lionel ran the music and Gladys ran the business.

Around 1945 or 1946, he handed a pair of vibraphone mallets to then-five year old (later jazz musician) Roy Ayers.

During the 1950s he had a strong interest in Judaism and raised money for Israel. In 1953 he composed a King David suite and performed it in Israel with the Boston Pops Orchestra. Later in life Hampton became a Christian Scientist. Hampton was also a Thirty-third degree Prince Hall freemason.

In January 1997, his apartment caught fire and destroyed his awards and belongings; Hampton escaped uninjured.

==Charity==
Hampton was deeply involved in the construction of various public housing projects, and founded the Lionel Hampton Development Corporation. Construction began with the Lionel Hampton Houses in Harlem, New York, in the 1960s, with the help of then Republican governor Nelson Rockefeller. Hampton&#x27;s wife, Gladys Hampton, also was involved in construction of a housing project in her name, the Gladys Hampton Houses. Gladys died in 1971. In the 1980s, Hampton built another housing project called Hampton Hills in Newark, New Jersey.

Hampton was a staunch Republican and served as a delegate to several Republican National Conventions. He served as vice-chairman of the New York Republican County Committee for some years and also was a member of the New York City Human Rights Commission. He served as Director of Special Events for Gerald Ford&#x27;s 1976 re-election campaign. Hampton donated almost $300,000 to Republican campaigns and committees throughout his lifetime. However, in 1996 he endorsed Clinton/Gore, saying that the Republican party, which he had joined because it was the party of Lincoln, no longer represented moderates like himself.

<text>Billy Childish (born Steven John Hamper; 1 December 1959) is an English painter, author, poet, photographer, film maker, singer, and guitarist. Since the late 1970s, Childish has been prolific in creating music, writing, and visual art. He has led and played in bands including the Thee Milkshakes, Thee Headcoats, and the Musicians of the British Empire, primarily working in the genres of garage rock, punk, and surf, and releasing more than 100 albums.

He is a consistent advocate for amateurism and free emotional expression. Childish co-founded the Stuckism art movement with Charles Thomson in 1999, which he left in 2001. Since then, a new evaluation of Childish&#x27;s standing in the art world has been under way, culminating with the publication of a critical study of Childish&#x27;s working practice by artist and writer Neal Brown, with an introduction by Peter Doig, which describes Childish as &quot;one of the most outstanding, and often misunderstood, figures on the British art scene&quot;. He is a visiting lecturer at Rochester Independent College. In July 2014 Childish was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts Degree from the University of Kent.

He is known for his explicit and prolific work – he has detailed his love life and childhood sexual abuse, notably in his early poetry and the novels &quot;My Fault&quot; (1996), &quot;Notebooks of a Naked Youth&quot; (1997), and &quot;Sex Crimes of the Futcher&quot; (2004) – &quot;The Idiocy of Idears&quot; (2007), and in several of his songs, notably in the instrumental &quot;Paedophile&quot; (1992) (featuring a photograph of the man who sexually abused him on the front cover) and &quot;Every Bit of Me&quot; (1993). From 1981 until 1987, Childish had a relationship with artist Tracey Emin.

Thirty years after Childish&#x27;s first musical releases with Thee Milkshakes and Thee Mighty Caesars, a crop of lo-fi, surf rock and punk groups with psychedelic subtexts has surfaced referencing the aesthetic established by Childish in both their band names and in various aspects of their sonic aesthetic: Thee Oh Sees, Thee Open Sex, Thee Tsunamis, Thee Dang Dangs, and many others.

==Background==

Billy Childish was born, lives, and works in Chatham, Kent. He has described his father, John Hamper, as a &quot;complex, sociopathic narcissist&quot;: Hamper was jailed during Childish&#x27;s teenage years for drug smuggling. Although he had an early and close association with many of the artists who became known as &quot;YBA&quot; artists, he has resolutely asserted his independent status. He was sexually abused when he was aged nine by a male family friend: &quot;We were on holiday. I had to share a bed with him. It happened for several nights, then I refused to go near him. I didn&#x27;t tell anyone&quot;. 

He left secondary school at 16, an undiagnosed dyslexic. Refused an interview at the local art college, he entered Chatham Dockyard, Kent, as an apprentice stonemason. During the next six months (the artist’s only prolonged period of conventional employment), he produced some 600 drawings in &quot;the tea huts of hell&quot;. On the basis of this work, he was accepted into Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art, where he was friends with the artist Peter Doig, to study painting. However, his acceptance was short-lived and he was expelled in 1982 before completing the course. He then lived on the dole for 15 years. In 2006, Childish turned down the offer to appear on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. Childish has practised yoga and meditation since the early 1990s.

==Painting==
As a prospective student lacking the necessary entry qualifications, Childish was accepted into art school four times on the strength of his paintings and drawings. He did a foundation year at Medway College of Design (now the University for the Creative Arts) in 1977–78, and was then accepted onto the painting department of Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art in 1978, before quitting a month later. He was re-accepted at St Martin&#x27;s in 1980, but was expelled in 1982 for refusing to paint in the art school and other unruly behaviour. At Saint Martin&#x27;s, Childish became friends with Peter Doig, with whom he shared an appreciation of Munch, Van Gogh, and blues music. Doig later co-curated Childish&#x27;s first London show at the Cubit Street Gallery. In the early/mid 1980s Childish was a &quot;major influence&quot; on the artist Tracey Emin, whom he met after his expulsion from Saint Martin&#x27;s when she was a fashion student at Medway College of Design. Childish has been cited as the influence for Emin&#x27;s later confessional art. Childish has exhibited extensively since the 1980s, and was featured in the British Art Show in 2000. In 2010, a major exhibition of Childish&#x27;s paintings, writing, and music was held at The ICA London, with a concurrent painting show running at White Columns Gallery in New York City. In October 2012, alongside Art Below, Childish presented his work at the exhibition Art Below Regents Park in Regent&#x27;s Park Tube station to coincide with Frieze Art Fair, one of the most important international contemporary art fairs that takes place each October in London.

In 2013, Childish began a painting collaboration with Edgeworth Johnstone, later titled Heckel&#x27;s Horse. Since 2013, after Charles Thomson (who co-founded Stuckism with Childish in 1999) introduced Childish to Johnstone&#x27;s work, Heckel&#x27;s Horse have made over 150 oil paintings, mostly on six foot Belgian linen canvases in Childish&#x27;s studio at Chatham Dockyard in Kent. In 2024, Childish referred to Heckel&#x27;s Horse as his &quot;favourite work&quot;.

==The British Art Resistance==
In 2008, Childish formed the &quot;non organisation&quot; the British Art Resistance, and held an exhibition under the title Hero of the British Art Resistance at The Aquarium L-13 gallery in London: A collection of paintings, books, records, pamphlets, poems, prints, letters, film, photographs made in 2008.

==Music==
Childish made records of punk, garage, rock and roll, blues, folk, classical/experimental, spoken word and nursery rhymes. In a letter to Childish, the musician Ivor Cutler said of Childish: &quot;You are perhaps too subtle and sophisticated for the mass market.&quot; Childish&#x27;s groups include TV21, later known as the Pop Rivets (1977–1980), sometimes spelled the Pop Rivits, with Bruce Brand, Romas Foord (replaced by Russell &#x27;Big Russ&#x27; Wilkins) and Russell &#x27;Little Russ&#x27; Lax.
He later formed a garage rock-inspired band called Thee Milkshakes (1980–1984) with Micky Hampshire, Thee Mighty Caesars (1985–1989), The Delmonas then Thee Headcoats (1989–1999). In 2000, he formed Wild Billy Childish and the Friends of the Buff Medways Fanciers Association (2000–2006), named after a type of poultry bred in his hometown. The Buff Medways, or the Buffs, as they were sometimes affectionately known, split in 2006, and Wild Billy Childish and the Musicians of the British Empire (MBEs) were born, recording a song about one of Childish&#x27;s heroes, George Mallory, titled &quot;Bottomless Pit&quot;. In early 2007, Childish formed The Vermin Poets with former Fire Dept singer and guitarist Neil Palmer and A-Lines guitarist and singer Julie Hamper, his wife. Thee Headcoats began their monthly residency at the Wild Western Room in the St John&#x27;s Tavern, north London, in the early 1990s, and continued after moving to the Dirty Water Club in 1996. The MBEs played at the venue more or less once a month until February 2011.

On 11 September 2009, Damaged Goods Records – Childish&#x27;s current label – issued a message to subscribers stating that Childish&#x27;s wife Julie (Nurse Julie, bassist in the MBEs) was pregnant. Childish has since been recording as bass player with The Spartan Dreggs, with Neil Palmer on vocals and guitar and Wolf Howard on drums. From 2013, the MBEs reunited under the name Wild Billy Childish [or &#x27;Chyldish&#x27;] and CTMF and as of the end of 2014 have released three albums.

In 2014, Childish produced, played on and co-wrote (with Dave Tattersall) most of the songs on The Wave Pictures&#x27; album &quot;Great Big Flamingo Burning Moon&quot;.

Childish has been namechecked by a number of famous musicians, including Kurt Cobain, Graham Coxon, The White Stripes (Jack White had Childish&#x27;s name written in large letters on his arm for an early &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; appearance), and Kylie Minogue, who named the LP &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; after his book .

==Poetry==
Childish is a confessional poet and has published over 40 collections of his work. In 1979, Childish was a founder member of The Medway Poets, a poetry performance group, who read at the Kent Literature Festival and the 1981 international Cambridge Poetry Festival. There were, however, personality clashes in the group, particularly between Childish and Charles Thomson, who said: &quot;There was friction between us, especially when he started heckling my poetry reading and I threatened to ban him from a forthcoming TV documentary.&quot; 

However, a Television South documentary on the group in 1982 brought them to a wider regional audience, though Childish&#x27;s poetry was &quot;deemed unbroadcastable&quot;.
According to Childish: &quot;Me &amp; Charles [sic] were at war from 1979 until 1999. He even threatened having bouncers on the doors of Medway Poets&#x27; readings to keep me out&quot;. Childish has twice won commendations in the National Poetry Prize.

==Tracey Emin==

During the 1980s, Childish was an influence on the artist Tracey Emin, whom he met in 1982, after his expulsion from the painting department at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art. Emin was a fashion student at Medway College of Design. Emin and Childish were a couple until 1987, Emin selling his poetry books for his small press Hangman Books. In 1995 she was interviewed in the &quot;Minky Manky&quot; show catalogue by Carl Freedman, who asked her, &quot;Which person do you think has had the greatest influence on your life?&quot; She replied:
:Uhmm... It&#x27;s not a person really. It was more a time, going to Maidstone College of Art, hanging around with Billy Childish, living by the River Medway.

Emin&#x27;s work &quot;Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995&quot; (1995) was first exhibited in the show, and Childish&#x27;s name was displayed prominently in it.

==The Stuckists==

In 1999 Childish and Thomson co-founded the Stuckist art movement. Thomson coined the group name from Childish&#x27;s &quot;Poem for a Pissed Off Wife&quot; (&quot;Big Hart and Balls&quot; 1994), where he had recorded Emin&#x27;s remark to him:
:&quot;Your paintings are stuck, you are stuck! – Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!&quot;

The group was strongly pro-figurative painting and anti-conceptual art. Childish wrote a number of manifestos with Thomson, the first of which contained the statement:
:&quot;Artists who don&#x27;t paint aren&#x27;t artists.&quot;
The Stuckists soon achieved considerable press coverage, fuelled by Emin&#x27;s nomination for the Turner Prize. They then announced the inauguration of a cultural period of Remodernism to bring back spiritual values into art, culture and society. The formation of The Stuckists directly led to Emin severing her 14-year friendship with Childish in 1999. Childish has said: &quot;The Stuckist art group was formed in 1999 at the instigation of Charles Thomson, the title of the group being taken from a poem of mine written and published in 1994. I disagreed with the way Charles presented the group, particularly in the media. For these reasons I left the Stuckists in 2001. I never attended any Stuckist demonstrations and my work was not shown in the large Stuckist exhibition held in the Walker Art Gallery in 2004.&quot;

British artist Stella Vine, who was a member of the Stuckists for a short time in 2001, first joined the group having developed a &quot;crush&quot; on Childish while attending his music events. In June 2000, Vine went to a talk given by Childish and fellow Stuckist co-founder Charles Thomson on Stuckism and Remodernism, promoted by the Institute of Ideas at the Salon des Arts, Kensington. Vine formed The Unstuckists one month after joining, and has since said she did not agree with Stuckism&#x27;s principles, and described them as bullies.

==Kurt Schwitters==
As a young man, Childish was highly influenced by Dada, and the work of Kurt Schwitters in particular. Childish has a Kurt Schwitters poem tattooed on his left buttock and made a short film on Schwitters&#x27;s life, titled The Man with Wheels, (1980, directed by Eugean Doyan).

==The Chatham Super 8 Cinema==

In 2002, along with Wolf Howard, Simon Williams and Julie Hamper, Childish formed The Chatham Super 8 Cinema. The group makes super 8 films on a second-hand camera Wolf Howard bought at a local flea market. In 2004, Childish released a 30-minute documentary titled &quot;Brass Monkey&quot;, about a march undertaken in Great War uniform commemorating the 90th anniversary of the British retreat from Mons in 1914.

<text>The  (&quot;Thoughts&quot;) is a collection of fragments written by the French 17th-century philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal. Pascal&#x27;s religious conversion led him into a life of asceticism, and the was in many ways his life&#x27;s work. It represented Pascal&#x27;s defense of the Christian religion, and the concept of &quot;Pascal&#x27;s wager&quot; stems from a portion of this work. 

==Contents==
The style of the book has been described as aphoristic, or by Peter Kreeft as more like a collection of &quot;sayings&quot; than a book.

Pascal is sceptical of cosmological arguments for God&#x27;s existence and says that when religious people present such arguments they give atheists &quot;ground for believing that the proofs of our religion are very weak&quot;. He argues that the Bible actually cautions against such means. Scripture says that &quot;God is a hidden God, and that, since the corruption of nature, He has left men in a darkness from which they can escape only through Jesus Christ, without whom all communion with God is cut off&quot;.

He writes that it is an &quot;astounding fact&quot; that no &quot;canonical&quot; writer ever offers such proofs and this makes it &quot;worthy of attention.&quot; Pascal considers atheists to strawman Christianity. He writes that &quot;If this religion boasted of having a clear view of God, and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be attacking it to say that we see nothing in the world which shows it with this clearness&quot;, however since &quot;on the contrary, it says that men are in darkness and estranged from God, that He has hidden Himself from their knowledge&quot; these arguments are not criticisms of Christianity For Pascal Christianity says God is found only by those &quot;who seek Him with all their heart&quot; but atheists do not do this and their arguments are not related to this process.

Pascal writes that &quot;Scepticism is true; for, after all, men before Jesus Christ did not know where they were, nor whether they were great or small. And those who have said the one or the other, knew nothing about it, and guessed without reason and by chance. They also erred always in excluding the one or the other.&quot;. He considers truth to be arrived at &quot;not only by the reason, but also by the heart, and it is in this last way that we know first principles; and reason, which has no part in it, tries in vain to impugn them&quot;. Sceptics then who only engage by means of reason &quot;labour to no purpose&quot;.

==Publication history==
The is the name given posthumously to fragments that Pascal had been preparing for an apology for Christianity, which was never completed. That envisioned work is often referred to as the &quot;Apology for the Christian Religion&quot;, although Pascal never used that title.

Although the appears to consist of ideas and jottings, some of which are incomplete, it is believed that Pascal had, prior to his death in 1662, already planned out the order of the book and had begun the task of cutting and pasting his draft notes into a coherent form. His task incomplete, subsequent editors have heavily disagreed on the order, if any, in which his writings should be read. Those responsible for his effects, failing to recognize the basic structure of the work, handed them over to be edited, and they were published in 1670. The first English translation was made in 1688 by John Walker. Another English translation by W. F. Trotter was published in 1931 with an introduction by T. S. Eliot.

Several attempts have been made to arrange the notes systematically; notable editions include those of Léon Brunschvicg, Jacques Chevalier, and (more recently) Philippe Sellier. Although Brunschvicg tried to classify the posthumous fragments according to themes, recent research has prompted Sellier to choose entirely different classifications, as Pascal often examined the same event or example through many different lenses. Also noteworthy is the monumental edition of Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; (1964–1992), which is known as the Tercentenary Edition and was realized by ; although still incomplete, this edition reviews the dating, history and critical bibliography of each of Pascal&#x27;s texts.

The Index Librorum Prohibitorum forbided its printing or reading, as it conflicts with the orthodoxy of the Catholic Church.

==Reception and legacy==
German philosopher Martin Heidegger was influenced by Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot;. During the 1920s Heidegger kept photograph of Pascal&#x27;s death mask in his study room. Pascal is mentioned in the introduction of (and quoted in two footnotes) his 1927 work &quot;Being and Time&quot;. In recent times scholars have noted parallels between Heidegger and &quot;Pensées&quot;, while postulating various instances of influence.

<text>Dame Julie Andrews (born Julia Elizabeth Wells on 1 October 1935) is an English actress, singer, and author. She has garnered numerous accolades throughout her career spanning over eight decades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, two Emmy Awards, three Grammy Awards, and six Golden Globe Awards as well as nominations for three Tony Awards. One of the biggest box office draws of the 1960s, Andrews has been honoured with the Kennedy Center Honors in 2001, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2007, and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2022. She was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000.

A child actress and singer, Andrews appeared in the West End in 1948 and made her Broadway debut in &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1954). Billed as &quot;Britain&#x27;s youngest prima donna&quot;, she rose to prominence in Broadway musicals starring as Eliza Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1956) and Queen Guinevere in &quot;Camelot&quot; (1960). She also starred in the Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1957). She made her film debut playing the title role in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) and won the Academy Award for Best Actress. The following year, she starred in the musical film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), playing Maria von Trapp and winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

Andrews starred in various films, working with directors including her husband Blake Edwards, George Roy Hill, and Alfred Hitchcock. Films she starred in include &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964), &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966), &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967), &quot;Star!&quot; (1968), &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot; (1974), &quot;10&quot; (1979), &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981), &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; (1982), &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; (1986), and &quot;Duet for One&quot; (1986). She later returned to films, acting in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; (2001), &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; (2004), as well as &quot;Eloise at the Plaza&quot; and &quot;Eloise at Christmastime&quot; (both 2003). She also has voiced roles in the &quot;Shrek&quot; franchise (2001–2010) and the &quot;Despicable Me&quot; franchise (2010–present). 

Andrews is also known for her collaborations with Carol Burnett, including television specials in 1962, 1971, and 1989. She starred in her variety special, &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot; (1973), for which she received the Primetime Emmy Award. Recently she co-created and hosted &quot;Julie&#x27;s Greenroom&quot; (2017), and voiced Lady Whistledown in the Netflix series &quot;Bridgerton&quot; (2020–present). Andrews has co-authored numerous children&#x27;s books with her daughter and two autobiographies, &quot;&quot; (2008) and &quot;Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years&quot; (2019).

== Early life and vocal training ==
Julia Elizabeth Wells was born on 1 October 1935 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England. Her mother, Barbara Ward Wells (née Morris; 25 July 1910–1984) was born in Chertsey and married Edward Charles &quot;Ted&quot; Wells (1908–1990), a teacher of metalwork and woodwork, in 1932. Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend. Andrews learned of her true parentage from her mother in 1950, although it was not publicly disclosed until her 2008 autobiography.

With the outbreak of World War II, her parents went their separate ways and were soon divorced. Each remarried: Barbara to Ted Andrews, in 1943, and Ted Wells in 1944 to Winifred Maud (Hyde) Birkhead, a war widow and former hairstylist at a war work factory that employed them both in Hinchley Wood, Surrey. Wells assisted with evacuating children to Surrey during the Blitz, while Andrews&#x27;s mother joined her husband in entertaining the troops through the Entertainments National Service Association. Andrews lived briefly with Wells and her brother, John, in Surrey. 

In 1940, Wells sent her to live with her mother and stepfather, who Wells thought would be better able to provide for his talented daughter&#x27;s artistic training. While Andrews had been used to calling her stepfather &quot;Uncle Ted&quot;, her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as &quot;Pop&quot;, while her father remained &quot;Dad&quot; or &quot;Daddy&quot; to her, a change which she disliked. The Andrews family was &quot;very poor&quot; and &quot;lived in a bad slum area of London&quot; at the time, stating that the war &quot;was a very black period in my life&quot;. According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic. He twice tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter while drunk, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.

As the stage career of her mother and stepfather improved, they were able to afford better surroundings, first to Beckenham and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews&#x27; hometown of Hersham. The family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (since demolished) where Andrews&#x27;s maternal grandmother had served as a maid. Andrews&#x27;s stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the independent arts educational school Cone-Ripman School (previously ArtsEd, now Tring Park School for the Performing Arts) and thereafter with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. 

Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, &quot;She had an enormous influence on me&quot;, adding, &quot;She was my third mother – I&#x27;ve got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world&quot;. In her memoir &quot;Julie Andrews – My Star Pupil&quot;, Stiles-Allen records, &quot;The range, accuracy and tone of Julie&#x27;s voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch&quot;, though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography &quot;Home&quot;. According to Andrews, &quot;Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was&quot;. Of her own voice, she says, &quot;I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come from miles around.&quot; After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.

== Career ==
=== 1945–1953: Early career ===
Beginning in 1945, and for the next two years, Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. &quot;Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening&quot;, Andrews explained. During her initial shows, Andrews stood on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, performing a solo or a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. She later stated that &quot;it must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right&quot;. Fellow child entertainer Petula Clark, three years her senior, recalled touring around the UK by train to sing for the troops alongside Andrews; they slept in the luggage racks. Clark later said &quot;It was fun—and not a lot of kids were having fun&quot;.

Andrews had her career breakthrough when her stepfather introduced her to managing director Val Parnell, whose Moss Empires controlled prominent performance venues in London. At the age of 12, Andrews made her professional solo debut at the London Hippodrome, singing the difficult aria &quot;Je suis Titania&quot; from &quot;Mignon&quot; as part of a musical revue, called &quot;Starlight Roof&quot;, on 22 October 1947. She played at the Hippodrome for one year. Of her role in &quot;Starlight Roof&quot;, Andrews recalled: &quot;There was this wonderful American person and comedian, Wally Boag, who made balloon animals. He would say, &#x27;Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?&#x27; And I would rush up onstage and say, &#x27;I&#x27;d like one, please.&#x27; And then he would chat to me and I&#x27;d tell him I sang. ... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy.&quot;

On 1 November 1948, a thirteen-year-old Andrews became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a Royal Variety Performance before King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at the London Palladium. Andrews performed alongside singer Danny Kaye, dancers the Nicholas Brothers, and the comedy team George and Bert Bernard.

Andrews subsequently followed her parents into radio and television. She performed in musical interludes of the BBC Light Programme comedy show &quot;Up the Pole&quot; and was a cast member in &quot;Educating Archie&quot;, from 1950 to 1952. She reportedly made her television début on the BBC programme &quot;RadiOlympia Showtime&quot; on 8 October 1949. Andrews appeared on West End theatre at the London Casino, where she played one year each as Princess Badroulbadour in &quot;Aladdin&quot; and the egg in &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. Andrews also appeared on provincial stages in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, as well as starring as the lead role in &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In 1952, she voiced Princess Zeila in the English dub of the Italian animated movie &quot;La Rosa di Bagdad&quot; (renamed &quot;The Singing Princess&quot;), in her first film and first venture into voice-over work.

=== 1954–1962: Broadway debut and breakthrough ===
On 30 September 1954, the eve of her 19th birthday, Andrews made her Broadway debut as Polly Browne in the London musical &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. Andrews was recommended to director Vida Hope for the part by actress Hattie Jacques, whom Andrews regards as a &quot;catalyst&quot; for her career. Eve Benda recognised her special talent and predicted her stardom. Andrews was anxious about moving to New York; at the time, she was both breadwinner and caretaker for her family, and took the part upon her father&#x27;s encouragement. 

Andrews stated that at the time, she had &quot;no idea&quot; how to research a role or study a script, and cites Cy Feuer&#x27;s direction as being &quot;phenomenal&quot;. &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; became a hit, with Andrews receiving praise; critics called her the stand-out of the show. In 1955, Andrews signed to appear with Bing Crosby in the television film, &quot;High Tor&quot;. It filmed in November 1955 in Los Angeles and was Andrews&#x27;s first screen project, which she described as &quot;daunting&quot;. &quot;High Tor&quot; was televised the following March before a live audience for the &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot;, receiving lukewarm reviews.

Near the end of her one-year run with &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, Andrews was approached to audition to Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe for the role of Eliza Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. She was offered the part during her third reading. She later wrote that she felt she could &quot;be Eliza, could find and understand her&quot; if only someone were to &quot;gently unravel the knotted ... string inside my stomach&quot;. 

During rehearsals, director Moss Hart spent forty-eight consecutive hours solely with Andrews, where they &quot;hammered through each scene&quot;; Andrews later stated that &quot;the good man had stripped [her] feelings bare ... moulded, kneaded, and helped [her] become the character of Eliza ... [and made] her part of [her] soul&quot;. Andrews referred it as the best acting lesson she had ever received, later cementing the role with her &quot;own touches and flourishes&quot; and continuing to work on the character throughout her two-year run. On 15 March 1956, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; opened on Broadway at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. The play was a huge success with both the audience and critics, though soon after opening she learned she needed to tone down her learned cockney accent so that the American audience could understand her, a change which was reversed at the West End performance a year later. Andrews describes her performances as Eliza as &quot;the great learning period&quot; of her life.

Richard Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews&#x27;s talent that concurrent with her run in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; she was featured in the Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical &quot;Cinderella&quot;, which was written especially for her. &quot;Cinderella&quot; was broadcast live on CBS on 31 March 1957 under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini and had an estimated 107 million viewers. The show was broadcast live in colour from CBS Studio 72, at Broadway and 81st Street in New York: CBS&#x27; only East Coast colour studio. Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award for her role. She described the performance as &quot;incredibly hard&quot; and stated it took her &quot;years to realise the enormity&quot; of the production. In 1957, Andrews released her debut solo album, &quot;The Lass with the Delicate Air&quot;, which harked back to her British music hall days. The album includes performances of English folk songs as well as the World War II anthem, &quot;London Pride&quot;, a patriotic song written by Noël Coward in 1941 during the Blitz, which Andrews herself had survived.

Between 1956 and 1962, Andrews guest-starred on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (15 July 1956), and also appeared on &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;. In June 1962, Andrews co-starred in &quot;Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall&quot;, a CBS special with Carol Burnett. In 1960, Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as Queen Guinevere in &quot;Camelot&quot;, along with Richard Burton (as King Arthur) and newcomer Robert Goulet. Andrews called the work &quot;monumental&quot; due to the heavy set costuming and detailed literary themes. Camelot premiered at the Majestic Theatre to &quot;adequate&quot; reviews, which Andrews credited to off-set production issues and comparisons to &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. The musical was substantially revised both before and during the show&#x27;s Broadway run.

Casting for the film adaptation of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; began in 1962; Alan Jay Lerner hoped for Andrews to reprise her role, but Warner Brothers studio head Jack Warner decided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition; the part was played by the established film actress Audrey Hepburn, with the bulk of the singing dubbed by Marni Nixon. As Warner later recalled that the decision was made for financial purposes, stating, &quot;In my business, I have to know who brings people and their money to a cinema box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop.&quot; Andrews later reflected that she understood her experience on Broadway &quot;was within a very small pond&quot; but wished she had been able to record her performance for posterity.

=== 1963–1967: &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and film stardom ===
In 1963, Andrews began work in the titular role of Disney&#x27;s musical film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. Walt Disney had seen her performance in &quot;Camelot&quot; and subsequently offered her the role; Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth, but Disney firmly insisted, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll wait for you.&quot; After the birth of her daughter, she received a call from P. L. Travers, author of the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; book series, who told her, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re much too pretty of course. But you&#x27;ve got the nose for it.&quot; Disney rented a house in Toluca Lake, Los Angeles, for her family to reside in during production. Andrews relied largely on instinct for her portrayal, conceptualising her background and giving the character a &quot;particular walk&quot; and a turned-out stance to suit her ladylike sensibility. Andrews referred to production as &quot;unrelenting&quot; given the physical exertion and technical details, saying that she &quot;could not have asked&quot; for a better introduction to film.

&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; became the biggest box-office draw in Disney history. &quot;Variety&quot; lauded Andrews&#x27;s performance as a &quot;signal triumph. ... She performs as easily as she sings, displaying a fresh type of beauty&quot;. The film was nominated for thirteen Academy Awards and won five, including the Academy Award for Best Actress for Andrews&#x27;s performance. She also received the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, while Andrews and her co-stars won the 1965 Grammy Award for Best Album for Children. As a measure of &quot;sweet revenge&quot;, as &quot;Poppins&quot; songwriter Richard M. Sherman put it, Andrews closed her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes by saying, &quot;And, finally, my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie and who made all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner.&quot; &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; was in direct competition for the awards.

Andrews starred opposite James Garner in the comedy-drama war film &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964). Andrews took the role partly to avoid typecasting as a nanny. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Andrews &quot;irresistible ... with a brush of sentiment&quot; in both her comedic and emotional scenes. Andrews was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. Andrews later described it as her favourite film, a sentiment shared by her co-star Garner. Andrews starred in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), which was the highest-grossing film of its year. Andrews later said she was &quot;ashamed&quot; to admit that she thought the musical &quot;rather saccharine&quot; before being cast. Rehearsals took place in London before filming commenced in Salzburg, Austria, in 1964. Filming was rather slow; because of weather conditions in Salzburg, the cast were &quot;lucky&quot; if they got a single shot&#x27;s worth of scenes.

Andrews stated she relied on lyrics to anchor her to the film&#x27;s songs and utilised vocal interpretation to &quot;convey&quot; Maria&#x27;s character by &quot;[hanging] onto words and the images they conjured&quot;. Andrews wrote that her senses were &quot;suffused&quot; with Austria, saying that the music &quot;still&quot; and &quot;always lives in her soul&quot;. The film received mixed reviews, though critics highlighted Andrews&#x27;s performance; Crowther again praised her for her &quot;air of radiant vigour ... plain-Jane wholesomeness and her ability to make her dialogue as vivid ... as she makes her songs&quot;. For her performance as Maria von Trapp, Andrews won her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She was nominated a second time for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. Andrews later wrote that the &quot;gift&quot; and &quot;privilege&quot; of portraying her first three film roles would have been &quot;enough to satisfy&quot; her for a lifetime.

After completing &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Andrews appeared as a guest star on the NBC-TV variety series &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;. She followed this television appearance with an Emmy Award-winning special, &quot;The Julie Andrews Show&quot;, which featured Gene Kelly and the New Christy Minstrels as guests. It aired on NBC-TV in November 1965. In 1966, Andrews starred in &quot;Hawaii&quot;, the highest-grossing film of its year. Also in 1966, she starred opposite Paul Newman in &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and shot at Universal Studios Hollywood. Hitchcock gave Newman and Andrews relative free rein in dialogue during production. She credits the director with teaching her extensively about lenses and camera-work. During a press interview, she &quot;made the mistake&quot; of expressing her unhappiness with her performance and subsequently received a &quot;terse&quot; letter from Hitchcock, which Andrews later cited as an &quot;important lesson&quot;. The film received mixed reviews upon release.

The following year, Andrews played the titular character in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967). Andrews described work on the film as a &quot;pleasant distraction&quot; for &quot;allowing her to be something of a clown&quot;, as her stepfather died shortly before filming. The film was a box office success; critics described Andrews as &quot;very much the leading lady&quot; and &quot;absolutely darling&quot; as well as &quot;deliciously spirited and dry&quot;. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and Andrews scored a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. At the time, &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; and &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; were the biggest and second-biggest hits in Universal Pictures history, respectively.

=== 1968–1996: Career setbacks and mid career === 

Andrews next appeared in two of Hollywood&#x27;s most expensive flops: &quot;Star!&quot; (1968), a biopic of Gertrude Lawrence; and &quot;Darling Lili&quot; (1970), co-starring Rock Hudson and directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards. Andrews &quot;went through her usual period of insecurity&quot; during the production of &quot;Star!&quot;, intensely analysing her choices for the character. Choreographer Michael Kidd worked closely with Andrews during the complicated musical numbers, which Andrews regarded as physically and mentally gruelling, coupled with her divorce from her first husband, Tony Walton. The &quot;New York Times&quot; singled out the film as &quot;not one of [Andrews]&#x27;s best&quot;, while &quot;Variety&quot; wrote her &quot;carefully built-up&quot; performance &quot;sagged&quot; with &quot;overdone hoydenishness&quot;. Despite reviews, her performance was once again nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Andrews regards her friendships with Kidd and director Robert Wise as her &quot;greatest gifts&quot; from the film.

Edwards pitched the concept of &quot;Darling Lili&quot; to Andrews two years prior to the start of production in 1968. She prerecorded original songs for the film with Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. Andrews cited &quot;Darling Lili&quot;&#x27;s tepid reviews as being caused by studio marketing and postproduction issues. While the film was a commercial bomb, the &quot;New York Times&quot; praised Andrews&#x27;s performance, calling her an &quot;unmitigated delight&quot; and &quot;perfect centerpiece&quot; of the film, praising &quot;her coolness and precision as a comedienne and a singer&quot;. She was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, while the film won both the Golden Globe and Academy Awards for Best Original Song. Of these films, Andrews later wrote that &quot;nonstop success in a career is impossible [...] but nobody sets out to make a failure, either&quot;.


Andrews was the first choice to play the English witch Eglantine Price in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971); Angela Lansbury was cast. Andrews continued working in television. In 1969, she shared the spotlight with singer Harry Belafonte for an NBC-TV special, &quot;An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte&quot;. In 1971, she appeared as a guest for the Grand Opening Special of Walt Disney World, and that same year she and Carol Burnett headlined a CBS special, &quot;Julie and Carol At Lincoln Center&quot;. In 1972–73, Andrews starred in her own television variety series, &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot;, on the ABC network. 

The show won seven Emmy Awards but was cancelled after one season. Between 1973 and 1975, Andrews continued her association with ABC by headlining five variety specials for the network. She guest-starred on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1977, and the following year, she appeared again with the Muppets on a CBS television variety special. The programme, &quot;Julie Andrews: One Step Into Spring&quot;, aired in March 1978, to mixed reviews and mediocre ratings. She made only two other films in the 1970s, &quot;The Tamarind Seed&quot; (1974) and &quot;10&quot; (1979), both successful at the box office and by critics&#x27; reviews.

In February 1980, Andrews headlined &quot;Because We Care&quot;, a CBS-TV special with 30 major stars raising funds for Cambodian Famine victims through Operation California (now Operation USA, on whose Board she serves). Later that year, she starred in &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; as &quot;English rose&quot; Amanda Worthington (a label she had first been given in the 1960s). In Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981), she played Sally Miles, a character who agrees to &quot;show my boobies&quot; in a scene in the film-within-a-film. A dual role of Victoria Grant and Count Victor Grezhinski in the film &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; (1982) reunited her with Garner once again. Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, as well as a nomination for the 1982 Academy Award for Best Actress, her third Oscar nomination. In 1983, Andrews was chosen as the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year by the Harvard University Theatrical Society. That year, she co-starred with Burt Reynolds in &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot;. Her next two films were &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot; and &quot;Duet for One&quot; (both 1986), which earned her Golden Globe nominations. In December 1987, Andrews starred in an ABC Christmas special, &quot;Julie Andrews: The Sound Of Christmas&quot;, which went on to win five Emmy Awards. Two years later, she was reunited for the third time with Carol Burnett for a variety special which aired on ABC in December 1989.

In 1991, Andrews made her television dramatic debut in the ABC made-for-TV film, &quot;Our Sons&quot;, co-starring Ann-Margret. Andrews was named a Disney Legend within the year. In the summer of 1992, Andrews starred in her first television sitcom; the short-lived &quot;Julie&quot; aired on ABC for only seven episodes and co-starred James Farentino. In December 1992 she hosted the NBC holiday special, &quot;Christmas In Washington&quot;. Having played a Cockney flower seller in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Andrews had an orangey-salmon pink rose named after her at London&#x27;s Chelsea Flower Show in 1992. Stating she was &quot;ever so flattered&quot;, portions of the sales of the &quot;Julie Andrews Rose&quot; were donated to charity. In 1993, she starred in a limited run at the Manhattan Theatre Club in the American premiere of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s revue, &quot;Putting It Together&quot;. Between 1994 and 1995, Andrews recorded two solo albums – the first saluted the music of Richard Rodgers and the second paid tribute to the words of Alan Jay Lerner. In 1995, she starred in the stage musical version of &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;. It was her first appearance in a Broadway show in 35 years. Opening on Broadway on 25 October 1995 at the Marquis Theatre, it later went on the road for a world tour. When she was the only Tony Award nominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because she felt the entire production was snubbed.

=== 2000–present: Children&#x27;s entertainment and later roles ===
A botched vocal surgery in 1997 led to the loss of Andrews&#x27;s singing voice, occasioning her refusal to sing on camera for several years. Despite this, Andrews kept busy with many projects. In 1998, she appeared in a stage production of &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; in London. As recounted on the Julie Andrews website, she performed the voice of Polynesia the parrot and &quot;recorded some 700 sentences and sounds, which were placed on a computer chip that sat in the mechanical bird&#x27;s mouth. In the song &#x27;Talk to the Animals,&#x27; Polynesia the parrot even sings.&quot; The next year Andrews was reunited with James Garner for the CBS made-for-TV film, &quot;One Special Night&quot;, which aired in November 1999.

In the 2000 New Year Honours List, Andrews was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to the performing arts and received the award from Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. In 2002, Andrews was among the guests at the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Hollywood party held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. She also appears at No.59 on the 2002 poll of the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; sponsored by the BBC and chosen by the British public.
In 2001, Andrews received Kennedy Center Honors. The same year, she reunited with &quot;Sound of Music&quot; co-star Christopher Plummer in a live television performance of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (an adaptation of the 1979 play). Andrews appeared in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, her first Disney film since &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. She starred as Queen Clarisse Marie Renaldi and reprised the role in the 2004 sequel, &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot;. In the film, Andrews sang on film for the first time since having throat surgery. The song, &quot;Your Crowning Glory&quot;, a duet with Raven-Symoné, was set in a limited range of an octave to accommodate her recovering voice. The film&#x27;s music supervisor, Dawn Soler, recalled that Andrews &quot;nailed the song on the first take. I looked around and I saw grips with tears in their eyes&quot;.

Andrews continued her association with Disney when she appeared as the nanny in two television films based on the Eloise books, a series of children&#x27;s books by Kay Thompson about a child who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. &quot;Eloise at the Plaza&quot; premiered in April 2003, and &quot;Eloise at Christmastime&quot; was broadcast in November 2003; Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award. The same year she made her debut as a theatre director, directing a revival of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, the musical in which she made her 1954 Broadway debut, at the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York. Her production, which featured costume and scenic design by her former husband Tony Walton, was remounted at the Goodspeed Opera House in 2005 and went on a national tour in 2006.

From 2005 to 2006, Andrews served as the Official Ambassador for Disneyland&#x27;s 18-month-long, 50th-anniversary celebration, the &quot;Happiest Homecoming on Earth&quot;, travelling to promote the celebration, recording narration and appearing at several events at the park. On 17 March 2005, Andrews appeared onstage during the curtain calls for the musical of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; at the Prince Edward Theatre in London&#x27;s West End, where she gave a speech recalling her own memories from making the film and praised the cast for their new interpretation. In 2004, Andrews voiced Queen Lillian in the animated blockbuster &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004), reprising the role for its sequels, &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007) and &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; (2010). Also in 2007, she narrated &quot;Enchanted&quot;, a live-action Disney musical comedy that both parodied and paid homage to Disney films.

On 1 May 2005, Disneyland debuted a new fireworks show, Remember... Dreams Come True, for Disneyland&#x27;s 50th anniversary, with Andrews being the host and narrator of the show. In January 2007, Andrews was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Screen Actors Guild&#x27;s awards and stated that her goals included continuing to direct for the stage and possibly to produce her own Broadway musical. She published &quot;&quot;, which she characterised as &quot;part one&quot; of her autobiography, on 1 April 2008. &quot;Home&quot; chronicles her early years in Britain&#x27;s music hall circuit and ends in 1962 with her winning the role of Mary Poppins. For a Walt Disney video release, she again portrayed Mary Poppins and narrated the story of &quot;The Cat That Looked at a King&quot; in 2004. From July until early August 2008, Andrews hosted &quot;Julie Andrews&#x27; The Gift of Music&quot;, a short tour of the United States where she sang various Rodgers and Hammerstein songs and symphonised her recently published book, &quot;Simeon&#x27;s Gift&quot;. Appearances included the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the Mann Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, and a performance with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. These were her first public singing performances in a dozen years, due to her failed vocal cord surgery. In January 2009, Andrews was named on &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; list of the top 10 British Actresses of all time. The list included Helen Mirren, Helena Bonham Carter, Judi Dench, and Audrey Hepburn. Also in 2009, Andrews received the honorary George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement.

In January 2010, Andrews was the official United States presenter for the Great Performances &quot;From Vienna: The New Year&#x27;s Celebration 2010&quot; concert. This was her second appearance in this role, after presenting the previous year&#x27;s concert. Andrews also had a supporting role in the film &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot;, which opened to unfavourable reviews although the box office receipts were successful. On her promotion tour for the film, she also spoke of Operation USA and the aid campaign to the Haiti disaster.
On 8 May 2010, Andrews made her London comeback after a 21-year absence (her last performance there was a Christmas concert at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989). She performed at The O2 Arena, accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and an ensemble of five performers. Earlier (on 15 December 2009 and on many other occasions), she appeared on British television saying that rumours that she would be singing at the performance were not true and that she would be doing a form of &quot;speak singing&quot;. However, she sang two solos and several duets and ensemble pieces. The evening, though well received by the 20,000 fans present, who gave her standing ovation after standing ovation, did not convince the critics.

On 18 May 2010, Andrews&#x27;s 23rd book (this one also written with her daughter Emma) was published. In June 2010, the book, entitled &quot;The Very Fairy Princess&quot;, reached number 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller List for Children&#x27;s Books. On 21 May 2010, her film &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; was released; in it Andrews reprises her role as the Queen. On 9 July 2010, &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, an animated film in which Andrews lent her voice to Marlena Gru, the thoughtless and soul-crushing mother of the main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), opened to rave reviews and strong box office. On 28 October 2010, Andrews appeared, along with the actors who portrayed the cinematic von Trapp family members, on &quot;Oprah&quot; to commemorate the film&#x27;s 45th anniversary. A few days later, her 24th book, &quot;Little Bo in Italy&quot;, was published.
In February 2011, Andrews received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and, with her daughter Emma, a Grammy for best spoken-word album for children (for &quot;A Collection of Poems, Songs and Lullabies&quot;), at the 53rd Grammy Awards. In her memoir, &quot;Home Work&quot; (2019), Andrews discussed being offered the role of Aunt Emma by Martin Scorsese for his film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2013). She declined, citing a recent surgery and saying she wasn&#x27;t &quot;ready to go back to work&quot; but &quot;would&#x27;ve loved to have done it&quot;. At the age of 77, Andrews undertook her first tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2013, hosted by Nicholas Hammond who was a boy of 14 when they appeared together in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. In place of singing, she planned a series of speaking engagements in Australia&#x27;s five mainland state capitals. The following year she took the show on a tour of England, which was hosted by Aled Jones. The tour began with a May date at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham and included an appearance at the Echo Arena in Liverpool.

Andrews has twice directed a musical stage adaptation of &quot;The Great American Mousical&quot;, based on the 2006 children&#x27;s book she wrote with her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton. The musical was written by Zina Goldrich (music) and Marcy Heisler (lyrics), with book by Hunter Bell. Andrews first directed the play for its premiere in 2012 at Goodspeed Musicals&#x27; Norma Terris Theatre in Chester, Connecticut. In 2024, she directed a second, sold-out production at Legacy Theatre in Branford, Connecticut.

In 2015, Andrews made a surprise appearance at the Oscars, greeting Lady Gaga who paid her homage by singing a medley from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. This became a social media sensation, trending all over the world. Lyndon Terracini announced in August 2015 that Andrews would direct &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in 2016 for Opera Australia at the Sydney Opera House. In 2016, Andrews created the preschool television series &quot;Julie&#x27;s Greenroom&quot; with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton and Judy Rothman. Andrews is joined by her assistant Gus (Giullian Yao Gioiello) and &quot;Greenies&quot;, a cast of original puppets built by The Jim Henson Company. The series premiered on Netflix in 2017. In 2017, Andrews also reprised her role as Marlena Gru in the second &quot;Despicable Me&quot; sequel &quot;Despicable Me 3&quot;. In 2018, Andrews voiced Karathen, a leviathan, in James Wan&#x27;s &quot;Aquaman&quot;. That same year, she declined a cameo appearance in &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; to avoid stealing the limelight now belonging to star Emily Blunt.

Beginning in December 2020, Andrews voiced the narrator Lady Whistledown in the Netflix period drama series &quot;Bridgerton&quot;. In 2022, Andrews narrated the film &quot;The King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; for Gravitas Ventures. She recorded her narration in 2020. A few weeks later she was announced to be the narrator. On 9 June 2022, Andrews was honoured by the American Film Institute with a Lifetime Achievement Award, where she reflected on her career and received tributes by multiple artists. The same year, she reprised her role as Gru&#x27;s mother in &quot;&quot;.

In April 2023, Andrews participated in the NBC primetime special &quot;Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Love&quot; where she paid tribute to her friend Carol Burnett. The same year, she also made a featured taped appearance on the primetime CBS special &quot;Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic&quot;, wherein she told the story of working alongside Van Dyke in the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Andrews married set designer Tony Walton on 10 May 1959 in Weybridge, Surrey. Maggie Smith was a guest. Andrews and Walton first met in 1948 when Andrews was appearing at the London Casino in the show &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. In 1962, their daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, was born. They divorced in 1968.

In November 1969, Andrews married director Blake Edwards, who had been her companion for at least two years, becoming stepmother to his children, Jennifer and Geoffrey. In the 1970s, Edwards and Andrews adopted two Vietnamese daughters, Amy (later known as Amelia) Leigh and Joanna Lynne. They were married for 41 years, until Edwards&#x27;s death at the age of 88 on 15 December 2010 at the Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, due to complications of pneumonia. Andrews was by her husband&#x27;s side when he died. Andrews is a grandmother to nine and a great-grandmother to three.

Andrews lives in Sag Harbor, New York, where the Bay Street Theater was co-founded by her daughter Emma.

== Vocal styling ==
Once termed &quot;Britain&#x27;s youngest prima donna&quot;, Andrews&#x27;s classically trained soprano voice, lauded for its &quot;pure and clear&quot; sound, has been described as light, bright and operatic in tone. When she was young, Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a throat specialist, the doctor concluded that she had &quot;an almost adult larynx&quot;. Despite the continual encouragement to pursue opera by her voice teacher, English soprano Lilian Stiles-Allen, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and &quot;too big a stretch&quot;. At the time, Andrews described her own voice as &quot;extremely high and thin&quot;, feeling that it lacked &quot;the necessary guts and weight for opera&quot;, preferring musical theatre instead.

As Andrews aged, so did her voice, which began to deepen naturally. Losing her vast upper register, her &quot;top notes&quot; became increasingly difficult to sing while &quot;her middle register matured into the warm golden tone&quot; for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Musically, she had always preferred singing music that was &quot;bright and sunny&quot;, choosing to avoid songs that were sad or otherwise written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice &quot;in a mess of emotion&quot;. She cited this as another reason for avoiding opera.

=== Loss of singing voice ===
Andrews was forced to quit the &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; stage production towards the end of the Broadway run in 1997 when she developed hoarseness in her voice. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital, reportedly to remove non-cancerous nodules from her throat, though she later stated the hoarseness was due to &quot;a certain kind of muscular striation [that] happens on the vocal cords&quot;—itself the result of a strain from &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; (she added &quot;I didn&#x27;t have cancer, I didn&#x27;t have nodules, I didn&#x27;t have anything&quot;). She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and made her speaking voice raspy. In 1999, she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews&#x27;s stepdaughter, Jennifer Edwards, said in 1999, &quot;It&#x27;s been two years, and it [her singing voice] still hasn&#x27;t returned.&quot; The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount.

Subsequently, from 2000 onwards, Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation, operated on her four times and, while able to improve her speaking voice, was unable to restore her singing.

== Acting credits ==
== Awards and honours ==
Over her career Andrews received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, six Golden Globe Awards, three Grammy Awards, and two Emmy Awards. Despite being nominated for three Tony Awards, Andrews never won. In June 2022, Andrews was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony in Los Angeles after a two-year delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2002, Andrews was ranked No. 59 in the BBC&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

<doc id="78242" wikidata="Q23628" url="?curid=78242" title="The Sopranos">
<text>The Sopranos is an American crime drama television series created by David Chase. The series revolves around Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), a New Jersey–based Italian-American mobster who struggles to balance his family life with his role as the leader of a criminal organization, which he reluctantly explores during therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series also features Tony&#x27;s various family members, Mafia colleagues, and rivals in prominent roles—most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and his protégé and distant cousin Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).

Having been greenlit in 1997, the series was broadcast on HBO from January 10, 1999, to June 10, 2007, spanning six seasons and 86 episodes. Broadcast syndication followed in the United States and internationally. &quot;The Sopranos&quot; was produced by HBO, Chase Films, and Brad Grey Television. It was primarily filmed at Silvercup Studios in New York City, with some on-location filming in New Jersey. The executive producers throughout the show&#x27;s run were Chase, Brad Grey, Robin Green, Mitchell Burgess, Ilene S. Landress, Terence Winter, and Matthew Weiner.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential television series of all time,&quot;The Sopranos&quot; has been credited with kickstarting the Second Golden Age of Television. The series won multiple awards, including Peabody Awards for its first two seasons, 21 Primetime Emmy Awards, and five Golden Globe Awards. It has been the subject of critical analysis, controversy, and parody; it has also spawned books, a video game, soundtrack albums, podcasts, and merchandise. Several members of the show&#x27;s cast and crew were largely unknown to the public when it began, but have since had successful careers.

In March 2018, New Line Cinema announced that they had purchased a film detailing the show&#x27;s background story, set in the 1960s and 1970s during and after the Newark riots. The film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot; (2021), was written by Chase and Lawrence Konner and directed by Alan Taylor. It starred Gandolfini&#x27;s son Michael Gandolfini as a young Tony Soprano.

==Premise==
The series follows Tony Soprano, a North Jersey–based Italian-American mobster, who tries to balance his family life with his role as the boss of the Soprano family. Suffering from anxiety-induced panic attacks, he reluctantly engages in therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi throughout the series. He puts his life at risk on multiple occasions and finds himself at odds with his uncle Junior, his wife Carmela, other Mafia members and non-Mafia criminals, and New York City&#x27;s Lupertazzi family.

==Production==
===Conception===

David Chase had worked as a television writer and producer for more than 20 years before creating &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. He had been employed as a staff writer or producer for several television series, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Switch&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot;, and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;. He had also co-created the series &quot;Almost Grown&quot; in 1988. He made his television directorial debut in 1986 with the &quot;Enough Rope for Two&quot; episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. He also directed episodes of &quot;Almost Grown&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; in 1988 and 1992, respectively. In 1996, he wrote and directed the television film &quot;The Rockford Files: Punishment and Crime&quot;. He served as showrunner for &quot;I&#x27;ll Fly Away&quot; and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; in the 1990s. Chase won his first Emmy Award in 1978 for his work on &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (shared with fellow producers) and his second for writing the 1980 television film &quot;Off the Minnesota Strip&quot;. By 1996, he was a coveted showrunner.

The story of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; was initially conceived as a feature film about &quot;a mobster in therapy having problems with his mother&quot;. Chase got some input from his manager Lloyd Braun and decided to adapt it into a television series. He signed a development deal in 1995 with production company Brillstein-Grey and wrote the original pilot script. He drew heavily from his personal life and his experiences growing up in an Italian-American family in New Jersey, and has stated that he tried to apply his own &quot;family dynamic to mobsters&quot;. For instance, the tumultuous relationship between series protagonist Tony Soprano and his mother Livia is partially based on Chase&#x27;s relationship with his own mother. He was also in psychotherapy at the time and modeled the character of Jennifer Melfi after his own psychiatrist.

Chase had been fascinated by organized crime and the mafia from an early age, witnessing such people growing up. He also was raised on classic gangster films such as &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; and the crime series &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. The series is partly inspired by the Richard Boiardo family, a prominent New Jersey organized crime family when Chase was growing up, and partly on New Jersey&#x27;s DeCavalcante family. He has mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show&#x27;s writing, and Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show&#x27;s cinematic style.
The series was named after high school friends of his.
Chase and producer Brad Grey pitched &quot;The Sopranos&quot; to several networks; Fox showed interest but passed on it after Chase presented them the pilot script. They eventually pitched the show to Chris Albrecht, president of HBO Original Programming, who decided to finance a pilot episode which was shot in 1997.
Chase directed it himself. They finished the pilot and showed it to HBO executives, but the show was put on hold for several months.

During this time, Chase, who had experienced frustration for a long period with being unable to break out of the TV genre and into film, considered asking HBO for additional funding to shoot 45 more minutes of footage and release &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as a feature film. In December 1997, HBO decided to produce the series and ordered 12 more episodes for a 13-episode season.
The show premiered on HBO on January 10, 1999, with the pilot, &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

====&quot;Baer v. Chase&quot;====
North Jersey prosecutor and municipal judge Robert Baer filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Chase in Trenton, New Jersey, federal court, alleging that he helped to create the show. Baer lost the suit, but he won a ruling that a jury should decide how much he should be paid for services as a location scout, researcher, and story consultant. Baer argued that he had introduced Chase to Tony Spirito, a restaurateur and gambler with alleged mob ties, and Thomas Koczur, a homicide detective for the Elizabeth, New Jersey police department. Chase had conducted interviews and tours with both, which strongly inspired some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. On December 19, 2007, a federal jury found against Baer, dismissing all of his claims.

===Casting===

Many of the actors on &quot;The Sopranos&quot; are Italian American from the New York metropolitan area, like the characters they portray, and many appeared together in films and television series before joining the cast of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. The series has 27 actors in common with the 1990 Martin Scorsese gangster film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, including main cast members Lorraine Bracco, Michael Imperioli, and Tony Sirico.

The casting directors were Georgianne Walken and Sheila Jaffe. The main cast was put together through a process of auditions and readings. Actors often did not know whether Chase liked their performances or not. Michael Imperioli beat out several actors for the part of Christopher Moltisanti; he said that Chase had &quot;a poker face, so I thought he wasn&#x27;t into me, and he kept giving me notes and having me try it again, which often is a sign that you&#x27;re not doing it right.&quot; Chase said that he wanted Imperioli because of his performance in &quot;Goodfellas.&quot;

James Gandolfini was invited to audition for the part of Tony Soprano after casting director Susan Fitzgerald saw a short clip of his performance in the 1993 film &quot;True Romance&quot;. Lorraine Bracco played the role of mob wife Karen Hill in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, and she was originally asked to play the role of Carmela Soprano. She took the role of Dr. Jennifer Melfi instead because she wanted to try something different and felt that the part of the highly educated Dr. Melfi would be more of a challenge for her. Tony Sirico had a criminal history, and he signed on to play Paulie Walnuts so long as his character was not to be a &quot;rat&quot;. Sirico had originally auditioned for the role of Uncle Junior with Frank Vincent, but Dominic Chianese landed the role.

Chase was impressed with Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s humorous appearance and presence after seeing him induct The Rascals into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and invited him to audition. Van Zandt, a guitarist in Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, had never acted before. He auditioned for the role of Tony Soprano, but HBO felt that the role should go to an experienced actor, so Chase wrote a new part for him. Van Zandt eventually agreed to star on the show as consigliere Silvio Dante, and his real-life spouse Maureen was cast as his on-screen wife Gabriella.

The cast of the debut season of the series consisted of largely unknown actors, with the exception of Bracco, Chianese, and Nancy Marchand, but many cast members were noted for their acting ability and received mainstream attention for their performances. Subsequent seasons saw established actors Joe Pantoliano, Robert Loggia, Steve Buscemi, and Frank Vincent join the starring cast, along with well-known actors in recurring roles such as Peter Bogdanovich, John Heard, Robert Patrick, Peter Riegert, Annabella Sciorra, and David Strathairn.

Numerous well-known actors appeared in one or two episodes, such as Lauren Bacall, Daniel Baldwin, Annette Bening, Polly Bergen, Sandra Bernhard, Paul Dano, Charles S. Dutton, Jon Favreau, Janeane Garofalo, Hal Holbrook, Tim Kang, Elias Koteas, Ben Kingsley, Linda Lavin, Ken Leung, Julianna Margulies, Sydney Pollack, Wilmer Valderrama, Alicia Witt, and Burt Young. Ray Liotta, who was eventually cast as two of the Moltisanti brothers in &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot; film prequel, was approached by Chase at one point to appear in the third or fourth seasons of the show, but the plan did not work out.

===Crew===
Series creator and executive producer David Chase served as showrunner and head writer for the production of all six seasons of the show. He was deeply involved with the general production of every episode and is noted for being a very controlling, demanding, and specific producer. He wrote or co-wrote between two and seven episodes per season and would oversee all the editing, consult with episode directors, give actors character motivation, approve casting choices and set designs, and do extensive but uncredited rewrites of episodes written by others. Brad Grey served as executive producer alongside Chase but had no creative input on the show. Many members of the creative team behind &quot;The Sopranos&quot; were handpicked by Chase, some being old friends and colleagues of his; others were selected after interviews conducted by producers of the show.

Many of the show&#x27;s writers had worked in television before joining the writing staff of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. The writing team and married couple Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess worked on the series as writers and producers from the first to the fifth season; they had previously worked with Chase on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;.
Terence Winter joined the writing staff during the production of the second season and served as executive producer from season five onwards. He practiced law for two years before deciding to pursue a career as a screenwriter, and he caught the attention of Chase through writer Frank Renzulli.

Matthew Weiner served as staff writer and producer for the show&#x27;s fifth and sixth seasons. He wrote a script for the series &quot;Mad Men&quot; in 2000 which was passed on to Chase, who was so impressed that he immediately offered Weiner a job as a writer for &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.
Cast members Michael Imperioli and Toni Kalem portray Christopher Moltisanti and Angie Bonpensiero respectively, and they also wrote episodes for the show. Imperioli wrote five episodes of seasons two through five, and Kalem wrote one episode of season five.

Other writers included Frank Renzulli, Todd A. Kessler (co-creator of &quot;Damages&quot;), writing team Diane Frolov and Andrew Schneider who worked with Chase on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, and Lawrence Konner, who co-created &quot;Almost Grown&quot; with Chase in 1988. In total, 20 writers or writing teams are credited with writing episodes of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Of these, Tim Van Patten and Maria Laurino receive a single story credit, and eight others are credited with writing a sole episode. The most prolific writers of the series were Chase (30 credited episodes, including story credits), Winter (25 episodes), Green and Burgess (22 episodes), Weiner (12 episodes), and Renzulli (9 episodes).

Many of the directors had previously worked on television series and independent films. The most frequent directors of the series were Tim Van Patten (20 episodes), John Patterson (13 episodes), Allen Coulter (12 episodes), and Alan Taylor (9 episodes), all of whom have a background in television. Recurring cast members Steve Buscemi and Peter Bogdanovich also directed episodes of the series intermittently. Chase directed the pilot episode and the series finale. Both episodes were photographed by the show&#x27;s original director of photography Alik Sakharov, who later alternated episodes with Phil Abraham. The show&#x27;s photography and directing is noted for its feature film quality. This look was achieved by Chase collaborating with Sakharov. &quot;From the pilot, we would sit down with the whole script and break the scenes down into shots. That&#x27;s what you do with feature films.&quot;

===Music===

&quot;The Sopranos&quot; is noted for its eclectic music selections and has received considerable critical attention for its effective use of previously recorded songs.
Chase personally selected all of the show&#x27;s music with producer Martin Bruestle and music editor Kathryn Dayak, sometimes also consulting Steven Van Zandt. The music was usually selected once the production and editing of an episode was completed, but on occasion sequences were filmed to match preselected pieces of music.

The show&#x27;s opening theme is &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; (Chosen One Mix), written by, remixed and performed by British band Alabama 3. With few exceptions, a different song plays over the closing credits of each episode. Many songs are repeated multiple times through an episode, such as &quot;Living on a Thin Line&quot; by The Kinks in the season three episode &quot;University&quot; and &quot;Glad Tidings&quot; by Van Morrison in the season five finale &quot;All Due Respect&quot;. Other songs are heard several times throughout the series. A notable example is &quot;Con te partirò&quot;, performed by Italian singer Andrea Bocelli,
which plays several times in relation to the character of Carmela Soprano.
While the show utilizes a wealth of previously recorded music, it is also notable for its lack of originally composed incidental music, compared with other television programs.

Two soundtrack albums containing music from the series have been released. The first, titled &quot;The Sopranos: Music from the HBO Original Series&quot;, was released in 1999. It contains selections from the show&#x27;s first two seasons and reached No. 54 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.
A second soundtrack compilation titled &quot;The Sopranos – Peppers &amp; Eggs: Music from the HBO Series&quot;, was released in 2001. This double-disc album contains songs and selected dialogue from the show&#x27;s first three seasons.
It reached No. 38 on the U.S. Billboard 200.

The ending to the show has drawn attention and sparked controversy. The song &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; by Journey plays at the end of the series finale. While Journey granted the rights to use the song in the ending of the series, their one request was that the scene not contain any violence or deaths.

===Sets and locations===
The majority of the exterior scenes took place in New Jersey and were filmed on location, with the majority of the interior shots filmed at Silvercup Studios in New York City, including most indoor shots of the Soprano residence, the back room of the strip club Bada Bing!, and Dr. Melfi&#x27;s office. The pork store was called Centanni&#x27;s Meat Market in the pilot episode, an actual butchery in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
After the series was picked up by HBO, the producers leased a building with a storefront in Kearny, New Jersey which served as the shooting location for exterior and interior scenes for the remainder of production; renamed Satriale&#x27;s Pork Store.
After the series ended, the building was demolished.

The strip club Bada Bing! was owned and operated by Silvio Dante on the show, and is an actual strip club on Route 17 in Lodi, New Jersey. Exteriors and interiors were shot on location except for the back room. The club is called Satin Dolls and was an existing business before the show started.
The club continued to operate during the eight years that the show was filmed there, and a business arrangement was worked out with the owner. Locations manager Mark Kamine recalls that the owner was &quot;very gracious&quot; as long as the shooting did not &quot;conflict with his business time&quot;.

Scenes set at the restaurant Vesuvio, owned and operated in the series by character Artie Bucco, were filmed at a restaurant called Manolo&#x27;s located in Elizabeth for the first episode. After the destruction of Vesuvio within the context of the series, Artie opened a new restaurant called Nuovo Vesuvio; exterior scenes set there were filmed at an Italian restaurant called Punta Dura located in Long Island City. All the exterior and some interior shots of the Soprano residence were filmed on location at a private residence in North Caldwell, New Jersey.

===Title sequence===
Tony Soprano is seen emerging from the Lincoln Tunnel out of Manhattan and passing through the tollbooth for the New Jersey Turnpike. Numerous landmarks in and around Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey, are then shown passing by the camera as Tony drives down the highway. The sequence ends with Tony pulling into the driveway of his suburban home. Chase has said that the goal of the title sequence was to show that this particular mafia show was about New Jersey, as opposed to New York, where most similar dramas have been set.

In the first three seasons, between Tony leaving the tunnel and passing through the toll plaza, the title sequence included a shot of the World Trade Center towers in the right side-view mirror. After the September 11 attacks, beginning with the show&#x27;s fourth season, this shot was removed and replaced with a more generic view.

In a 2010 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;, the show&#x27;s opening title sequence ranked No. 10 on a list of TV&#x27;s top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.

A parody of the opening sequence was used in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot;, a variation on the sequence is used, with Fat Tony leaving a Springfield tunnel instead of Tony. Fat Tony then continues to drive through Springfield to the same soundtrack as the original.

==Cast and characters==


&quot;The Sopranos&quot; features a large cast of characters, many of whom get significant amounts of character development. Some only appear in certain seasons, while others appear (sporadically or constantly) throughout the entire series. All characters were created by David Chase unless otherwise noted.

Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) is the series&#x27; protagonist. Tony is one of the capos of the New Jersey–based DiMeo crime family at the beginning of the series; he eventually becomes its undisputed boss. He is also the patriarch of the Soprano household. Throughout the series, Tony struggles to balance the conflicting requirements of his family with those of the Mafia family he controls. Because he is prone to bouts of clinical depression and reflex syncope, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony&#x27;s physician refers him for treatment by psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) in the show&#x27;s first episode.

She treats Tony to the best of her ability, even when he is triggered to violent, angry outbursts. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational, and humane, which is a stark contrast to Tony&#x27;s personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi. Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony too, but rarely admits it and never acts on it. Melfi is drawn to the challenge of helping such an unusual client and naively assumes that their doctor–patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.

Adding to Tony&#x27;s complicated life is his relationship with his wife Carmela (Edie Falco), which is strained by his constant infidelity and her struggle to reconcile the reality of Tony&#x27;s business, of which she is often in denial, with the affluent lifestyle and higher social status it brings her. Tony and Carmela default to anger, criticism and yelling in their parenting, and so have challenging relationships with their two children: the intelligent, but rebellious, Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) and underachiever Anthony Jr. (&quot;A.J.&quot;) (Robert Iler), whose everyday teenage issues are further complicated by their eventual knowledge of their father&#x27;s criminal activities and reputation.

The starring cast includes members of Tony&#x27;s extended family, including his narcissistic, disapproving, manipulative mother, Livia (Nancy Marchand), his aimless, histrionic older sister Janice (Aida Turturro), his crafty, paternal uncle Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano (Dominic Chianese) who is nominal boss of the crime family following the death of then-acting boss Jackie Aprile Sr. (Michael Rispoli), Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli) his immature and hot-headed cousin and protégé and his maternal cousin Tony Blundetto (Steve Buscemi).

Both Livia and Janice are scheming treacherous shrewd manipulators with major unaddressed psychological issues of their own. The single-mindedly ambitious Uncle Junior is chronically frustrated by having not been made boss of the DiMeo family, despite old-school mob traditions entitling him to the position by seniority. He feels his authority is perpetually undermined by Tony&#x27;s greater influence in the organization and barely contains his seething jealousy at having to watch both his younger brother (Tony&#x27;s father) and now Tony leapfrog him in the organization. As their professional tensions escalate, Uncle Junior employs increasingly desperate behind-the-scenes measures to solve his problems with Tony, who still idolizes his uncle, and wants to retain Junior&#x27;s affection and approval.

Uncle Junior and Christopher are fixtures in Tony&#x27;s real family, as well as his crime family, so their actions in one realm often create further conflicts in the other. Christopher, an entitled, insecure DiMeo associate who is as ambitious as he is insubordinate and incompetent, is also a chronic substance abuser. Tony Blundetto is a well-respected DiMeo family soldier who returns after completing a lengthy prison sentence; he leaves prison committed to &quot;going straight&quot; (to Tony&#x27;s dismay), but also has an intense violent streak.

Those in Tony&#x27;s closest circle within the DiMeo crime family include Silvio Dante (Steven Van Zandt), Tony&#x27;s consigliere and best friend who runs the family&#x27;s strip club headquarters and other businesses, Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; Gualtieri (Tony Sirico), a tough, short-tempered, aging soldier who is fiercely loyal to Tony, and Salvatore &quot;Big Pussy&quot; Bonpensiero (Vincent Pastore), a veteran gangster who runs an automotive body shop. Paulie &quot;Walnuts&quot; and &quot;Big Pussy&quot; (often called just &quot;Pussy&quot;) have worked with Tony and his father. Also in Tony&#x27;s criminal organization are Patsy Parisi (Dan Grimaldi), a soft-spoken soldier with a head for figures, and Furio Giunta (Federico Castelluccio), an Italian national who joins the family later in the series, who serves as Tony&#x27;s violent enforcer and bodyguard.

Other significant characters in the DiMeo family include Bobby &quot;Bacala&quot; Baccalieri (Steven R. Schirripa); Richie Aprile (David Proval); Ralph Cifaretto (Joe Pantoliano); Eugene Pontecorvo (Robert Funaro); and Vito Spatafore (Joseph R. Gannascoli). Bobby is a subordinate of Uncle Junior&#x27;s whom Tony initially bullies, but later accepts into his inner circle. Ralph is a clever, ambitious top-earner, but his arrogant, obnoxious, disrespectful, and unpredictably violent tendencies turn Tony resentful. Richie Aprile is released from prison in season 2 and quickly makes waves. Pontecorvo is a young soldier who becomes a &quot;made&quot; man alongside Christopher. Spatafore works his way up through the ranks to become top earner of the Aprile crew but is secretly gay.

Friends of the Soprano family include Herman &quot;Hesh&quot; Rabkin (Jerry Adler); Adriana La Cerva (Drea de Matteo); Rosalie Aprile (Sharon Angela); Angie Bonpensiero (Toni Kalem), along with Artie (John Ventimiglia) and Charmaine Bucco (Kathrine Narducci). Hesh is an invaluable adviser and friend to Tony, as he was when Tony&#x27;s father ran things. Adriana is Christopher&#x27;s loyal and long-suffering girlfriend; the two have a volatile relationship but appear destined to stay together. Christopher often ignores Adriana&#x27;s advice and winds up regretting it. Rosalie is the widow of previous DiMeo boss Jackie Aprile Sr. and a very close friend of Carmela. Angie is Salvatore Bonpensiero&#x27;s wife. She later goes into &quot;business&quot; for herself, and quite successfully.

Artie and Charmaine are childhood friends of the Sopranos, and owners of the popular restaurant Vesuvio. Charmaine wishes to have no association with Tony and his crew due to fears that Tony&#x27;s criminal ways will ultimately ruin everything she and Artie have achieved. Artie, however—a law-abiding, hard-working man—is drawn to his childhood friend Tony&#x27;s glamorous, seemingly carefree lifestyle. Charmaine bitterly resents Artie&#x27;s chronic tendency to disregard her wishes while catering to Tony&#x27;s; their marriage suffers greatly as a result. Charmaine also had a brief sexual encounter with Tony (when he and Carmela had temporarily broken-up) when all four were teenagers.

John &quot;Johnny Sack&quot; Sacramoni (Vince Curatola), Phil Leotardo (Frank Vincent) and &quot;Little&quot; Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. (Ray Abruzzo) are all significant characters from the New York City–based Lupertazzi crime family, which shares a good amount of its business with the Soprano organization. Although the Lupertazzis&#x27; and DiMeos&#x27; interests are often at odds, Tony maintains a cordial, business-like relationship with &quot;Johnny Sack&quot;, preferring to make mutually beneficial deals, not war. Johnny Sack&#x27;s second-in-command and eventual successor, Phil Leotardo, is less friendly and harder for Tony to do business with. Little Carmine is the son of the family&#x27;s first boss and vies for power with its other members.

==Episodes==

===Season 1 (1999)===

When Tony Soprano collapses after suffering a panic attack, he begins therapy with Dr. Jennifer Melfi. Details of Tony&#x27;s upbringing—with his father&#x27;s influence looming large on his development as a gangster, but more so that of Tony&#x27;s mother, Livia, who is vengeful, narcissistic, and possibly psychopathic—are revealed. His complicated relationship with his wife Carmela is also explored, as well as her feelings regarding her husband&#x27;s &quot;cosa nostra&quot; ties. Meadow and Anthony Jr., Tony&#x27;s children, gain increasing knowledge of their father&#x27;s mob dealings. Later, federal indictments are brought as a result of someone in his organization talking to the FBI.

Tony&#x27;s uncle Corrado &quot;Junior&quot; Soprano, who controls his own crew, orders the murder of Brendan Filone and the mock execution of Christopher Moltisanti, associates of Tony&#x27;s, as a reprisal for repeated hijackings of trucks under Corrado&#x27;s protection. Tony defuses the situation by allowing his uncle to be installed as boss of the family (following the death of the previous boss Jackie Aprile from cancer), while Tony retains actual control of most dealings from behind the scenes. Corrado discovers the subterfuge, after talking to Livia and falling for her subtle manipulation, and he orders an attempt on Tony&#x27;s life. The assassination is botched and Tony responds violently, before confronting his mother for her role in plotting his downfall; she appears to have a psychologically triggered stroke as a result. Junior is arrested by the FBI on charges related to the federal indictments before Tony gets a chance to murder him in retaliation.

===Season 2 (2000)===

Jackie&#x27;s brother Richie Aprile is released from prison. He proves to be uncontrollable in the business arena, siding more with Junior than Tony, despite the fact that Tony is the acting boss of the family after Junior&#x27;s arrest. Richie starts a relationship with Janice, Tony&#x27;s sister, who has arrived from Seattle to take care of their mother. &quot;Big Pussy&quot; returns to New Jersey after a conspicuous absence.

Christopher Moltisanti becomes engaged to his girlfriend Adriana La Cerva, despite his past abuse. Matthew Bevilaqua and Sean Gismonte, two low-level associates dissatisfied with their perceived lack of success in the Soprano crew, try to make names for themselves by attempting to kill Christopher as a favor to Richie, even though he didn&#x27;t ask them to. Their plan fails and Christopher kills Sean, but Christopher is critically wounded. He manages to recover after surgery. Tony and Big Pussy locate Matthew and kill him. A witness to the murder goes to the FBI and identifies Tony, but later retracts his statement.

Junior is placed under house arrest as he awaits trial. Richie, frustrated with Tony&#x27;s authority over him, entreats Junior to have Tony killed. Junior feigns interest, then informs Tony of Richie&#x27;s intentions, leaving Tony with another problem to address. However, the situation is defused unexpectedly when Janice kills Richie in a violent argument; Tony and his men conceal all evidence of the murder, and Janice returns to Seattle.

After a food poisoning incident that causes vivid dreams, Tony finally comes to terms with his suspicion that Big Pussy might be an FBI informant. He manages to search Pussy&#x27;s bedroom under false pretenses and discovers damning evidence. Tony kills Pussy on board a boat (with assistance from Silvio Dante and Paulie Gualtieri), disposing of his body at sea.

===Season 3 (2001)===

Following the &quot;disappearance&quot; of Richie Aprile, the return of the ambitious Ralph Cifaretto, having spent an extended period of leisure time in Miami, marks the third season. He renews a relationship with Rosalie Aprile, the widow of Jackie Aprile Sr. With Richie assumed to have joined the Witness Protection Program, Ralph unofficially usurps control over the Aprile crew, proving to be an exceptionally dexterous earner. While Ralph&#x27;s competitive merit would seemingly have him next in line to ascend to capo, his insubordination inclines Tony not to promote him and he instead gives the promotion to the less qualified but competent Gigi Cestone, causing much resentment and tension between him and Ralph.

Ralph ultimately crosses the line when, in a cocaine-induced rage, he gets into a confrontation with his pregnant girlfriend Tracee and beats her to death. This infuriates Tony, who had come to care for the girl, to the point where he violates the traditional mafia code by beating Ralph in front of the entire family. Bad blood temporarily surfaces between the two but is shortly resolved after Ralph apologizes. Cestone suffers a fatal heart attack, thereby forcing Tony to reluctantly promote Ralph to capo.

After getting arrested at the airport for stolen airplane tickets that Tony gave her, Livia is set to testify against him in court. Before that can happen, Livia dies of a stroke and Tony has to deal with his complicated feelings surrounding their relationship. Junior is diagnosed with stomach cancer; following surgery and chemotherapy, it goes into remission.

One night after work, Dr. Melfi is raped by a stranger in a parking complex. After police mishandle evidence, the suspect is released from custody without facing charges. Dr. Melfi struggles with the fallout of the assault and the notion that she could ask Tony to deal out his brand of justice, which she ultimately decides against. Meanwhile, Tony begins an affair with Gloria Trillo, who is also a patient of Dr. Melfi. Their relationship is brief and tumultuous.

Rosalie&#x27;s son Jackie Aprile Jr. becomes involved with Meadow and then descends into a downward spiral of recklessness, drugs, and crime. Tony initially attempts to act as a mentor to Jackie and encourages him to stay in school, but he becomes increasingly impatient with Jackie&#x27;s escalating misbehavior, particularly as Jackie&#x27;s relationship with Meadow begins to become serious. Inspired by a story from Ralph about how Tony, Jackie Sr., and Silvio Dante got made, Jackie and his friends Dino Zerilli and Carlo Renzi make a similar move and attempt to rob Eugene Pontecorvo&#x27;s Saturday night card game so they can gain recognition from the family.

The plan takes a turn for the worse when Jackie panics and kills the card dealer, provoking a shoot-out. Dino and Carlo are killed, but Jackie manages to escape. Tony decides to let Ralph handle the decision regarding Jackie Jr.&#x27;s punishment, but he strongly implies that he thinks Ralph should kill Jackie. Despite his role as a surrogate father, Ralph decides to have Jackie Jr. killed when other members of the crew play up how badly Jackie had disrespected him.

A.J. continues to get in trouble at school—despite success on the football team—which culminates in his expulsion and his parents considering sending him to military school. When he suffers a panic attack, his second after the one his old school failed to report, Tony realizes A.J. can&#x27;t attend military school and he blames himself. Meadow is hit hard by Jackie Jr.&#x27;s death, resorting to drinking and then storming out of his funeral reception.

===Season 4 (2002)===

New York underboss Johnny Sack becomes enraged after learning Ralph Cifaretto joked about his wife&#x27;s weight. He seeks permission from boss Carmine Lupertazzi to have Ralph clipped, but is denied. Johnny orders the hit anyway. Tony receives the okay from Carmine to hit Johnny for insubordination. Junior Soprano tips Tony to use an old outfit in Providence for the work. After catching his wife eating sweets secretly instead of following her diet, Johnny Sack talks it out with her and then calls off the hit on Ralph, averting bloodshed.

Tony and Ralph invest in a racehorse named Pie-O-My, who wins several races and makes them both a great deal of money until the horse dies in a stable fire. When Ralph&#x27;s 12-year-old son Justin is severely injured in an archery accident, Tony comes to believe Ralph started the stable fire himself in order to collect $200,000 in insurance money. Tony confronts Ralph and Ralph denies setting the fire. The two engage in a violent brawl, culminating in Tony strangling Ralph to death. Tony and Christopher dispose of the body and tell the rest of the crew that the likely culprit for Ralph&#x27;s disappearance is Johnny Sack.

While he is leaving court, Junior is hit in the head with a boom mic and falls down several steps. Tony advises him to take advantage of the opportunity, act mentally incompetent and employ it as a ruse for not continuing the trial. When that fails, Eugene Pontecorvo intimidates a juror, resulting in a deadlocked jury, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial.

Following the death of Bobby Baccalieri&#x27;s wife, Janice pursues a romantic relationship with him. Bobby is initially reluctant to move on, but after an incident with his kids and Anthony Jr. trying to summon his deceased wife&#x27;s ghost, he becomes more receptive to Janice&#x27;s advances.

Christopher&#x27;s addiction to heroin deepens, prompting his associates and family to organize an intervention, after which he enters a drug rehabilitation center. Adriana&#x27;s friend Danielle Ciccolella is revealed to be an undercover FBI agent named Deborah Ciccerone-Waldrup, who tells Adriana the only way for her to stay out of prison for cocaine distribution at her bar is to become an informant. Adriana reluctantly agrees and starts sharing information with the FBI.

Carmela, whose relationship with Tony is tense due to financial worries and Tony&#x27;s infidelities, develops a mutual infatuation with Furio Giunta. Furio, incapable of breaking his personal moral code and that of the Neapolitan mafia, clandestinely returns home to Italy. After Tony&#x27;s former mistress calls their home, Carmela throws Tony out. As a result, their plan to buy a beach house falls through and Tony pesters the owner until he gets his deposit back.

Anthony Jr. starts attending a new high school, with Tony suggesting he needed to pull some strings to get him in. A.J. gets a girlfriend but is intimidated by her family&#x27;s wealth. Meadow initially struggles with her ex-boyfriend&#x27;s death. As she considers taking a gap year or switching schools, she sees a therapist that Dr. Melfi recommended. Eventually, Meadow finds a worthwhile cause by volunteering at a law center. She gets an apartment with some roommates and starts dating again. Her relationship with Carmela becomes strained after several arguments. Both the kids take their parents&#x27; separation hard, with A.J. asking to live with his dad instead of his mom.

Tony decides to quit therapy, thinking he isn&#x27;t making any progress. He thanks Dr. Melfi for all her help and they part amicably. Stuck in a deadlock over a deal with the Lupertazzi family, Tony is approached by Johnny Sack with a proposal to murder Carmine. He considers it, even after managing to reach an agreement with Carmine, but he later becomes suspicious of Johnny&#x27;s intentions and turns him down.

===Season 5 (2004)===

A string of new characters are introduced, including Tony&#x27;s cousin Tony Blundetto, who simultaneously along with other Mafiosi, is released from prison. Among the others released are former DiMeo crime family capo Michele &quot;Feech&quot; La Manna, Lupertazzi family capo Phil Leotardo, and semi-retired Lupertazzi consigliere Angelo Garepe. Tony offers Tony B a job, but he respectfully declines, as he is determined to lead a straight life. He initially begins to take courses to earn a degree in massage therapy and aspires to open up a massage parlor. After Carmine Lupertazzi dies of a stroke, his death leaves a vacancy for the boss of the Lupertazzi family, which will soon be fought over by underboss Johnny Sack and Carmine&#x27;s son Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. After Feech proves to be an insubordinate presence, Tony arranges for him to be sent back to prison by setting him up with stolen property, violating his parole.

The war between Johnny Sack and Carmine Jr. begins when Johnny has Phil kill &quot;Lady Shylock&quot; Lorraine Calluzzo. Tony B&#x27;s attempt to stay straight comes to a head when he gets into a brawl with his employer. Angelo, who was a good friend to Tony B in prison, and Lupertazzi capo Rusty Millio offer Tony B the job of taking out Joey Peeps in retaliation for Lorraine&#x27;s death. Tony B initially declines but, desperate to earn, accepts the job. He catches Joey outside a bordello, shoots him, and quickly flees the scene. Johnny believes Tony B is involved and retaliates by having Phil and his brother Billy Leotardo kill Angelo. Tony B finds the Leotardo brothers and opens fire, killing Billy and wounding Phil.

Separated from Carmela, Tony is living at his parents&#x27; house. Carmela, the sole authority figure in the home, becomes frustrated as her rules lead A.J. to resent her so she allows him to live with his father. She has a brief relationship with Robert Wegler, A.J.&#x27;s guidance counselor; he breaks it off abruptly when he suspects that she is manipulating him to improve A.J.&#x27;s grades. Tony and Carmela reconcile; Tony promises to be more loyal and agrees to pay for a piece of real estate Carmela wishes to develop.

Tony gets Meadow&#x27;s boyfriend Finn De Trolio a summer job at a construction site, which is run by Aprile crew capo Vito Spatafore. Finn comes in early one morning and catches Vito performing fellatio on a security guard. Vito tries to buddy up to Finn so that he keeps quiet, but Finn soon quits the job out of fear.

After covering up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI to start sharing more relevant information about the family to avoid being charged as an accomplice. Rather than taking the risk of wearing a wire, Adriana confesses to Christopher and tries to persuade him to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. A grief-stricken Christopher instead informs Tony, who has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to the hospital to see Christopher after he supposedly attempted suicide, but Silvio instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana&#x27;s betrayal and subsequent execution are too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly relapses into drug use to deal with the pain.

Phil Leotardo and his henchmen beat Benny Fazio while trying to acquire the whereabouts of Tony B; Phil also threatens to have Christopher taken out if Tony B&#x27;s whereabouts are not disclosed soon. To pacify New York and give his cousin a painless death, Tony tracks Tony B to their Uncle Pat&#x27;s farm and executes him. Phil is furious that he did not get the opportunity to do it himself. Tony and Johnny meet at Johnny&#x27;s house in a reconciliatory manner, but Johnny is arrested by Federal agents, while Tony escapes.

===Season 6 (2006–07)===

A senile and confused Uncle Junior shoots Tony one night in his house. Rendered comatose, Tony dreams he is a salesman on a business trip who mistakenly exchanges his briefcase and identification with a man named Kevin Finnerty. Tony&#x27;s recovery from the shooting changes his outlook and he tries to mend his ways. However, he is faced with more problems in his business and personal life.

Once Tony is out of the hospital, Johnny Sack&#x27;s daughter is about to get married and the Soprano family attends the wedding. Johnny is approved to leave prison for six hours to attend, but he is humiliated by having to pay for the metal detectors and the presence of U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about to drive away with her husband, Johnny&#x27;s time expires and the marshals publicly take him back to prison. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny bursts into tears as he is handcuffed, dismantling the remaining respect his and Tony&#x27;s crews had for him.

Vito Spatafore is outed as gay after running into a friend making collections at a New York gay nightclub. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito. Finn is forced to tell Tony&#x27;s entire crew what happened with Vito and the security guard at the construction site, solidifying their suspicions about Vito&#x27;s sexuality. Tony is urged to deal with the problem by the intensely homophobic Phil Leotardo, now the acting boss of New York, whose cousin is married to Vito.

Once Vito is confronted by other members of the crew, he flees to a New Hampshire town, where he poses as an author and starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Despite finally living an authentic life, Vito misses the benefits his old job afforded him, so he eventually returns to New Jersey. He asks Tony to allow him to return to work, making a case that he could bring in a lot of money in Atlantic City. Vito visits his wife and children and continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual.

Tony mulls over the decision to let him back into the crew, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and brutally executes Vito. When one of the members of the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won&#x27;t stop making jokes about Vito and his death, Silvio Dante and Carlo Gervasi kill Fat Dom out of anger at his disrespect. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of an all-out war.

During the first half of the season, Christopher and Little Carmine head to Los Angeles in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to try to sign Ben Kingsley for a slasher film they are trying to make called &quot;Cleaver&quot;, which is a mix of &quot;The Godfather&quot; and &quot;Saw&quot;. While in Los Angeles, Chris goes back to drinking and using cocaine for a short period, and he robs famous actress Lauren Bacall. When &quot;Cleaver&quot; comes out, Carmela is upset that the boss, who is based on Tony, sleeps with his underling&#x27;s girlfriend, who seems to be based on Christopher&#x27;s ex Adrianna. Tony&#x27;s negative portrayal in the movie further strains his relationship with Christopher, along with the fact that Christopher had an affair with realtor Julianna Skiff, a woman Tony was romantically interested in. When Christopher&#x27;s new girlfriend Kelli Lombardo accidentally gets pregnant, they decide to get married in Atlantic City. Later they welcome a baby girl.

Tony considers killing several of his associates for relatively minor infractions, including Paulie Gualtieri. Christopher is unable to thrive in the business because of his addiction, deflecting his problems by relapsing and killing his friend from Narcotics Anonymous and co-writer of &quot;Cleaver&quot;, J. T. Dolan. He is then seriously injured in a car accident while driving under the influence of narcotics. Tony, the sole passenger, finally loses patience with Christopher&#x27;s failings and suffocates him. He later tries to justify his actions by bringing up the infant car seat that was impaled by a branch in the accident, implying that Christopher was a danger to his daughter.

A.J. is dumped by his fiancée and he slips into depression, culminating in a suicide attempt in the backyard pool. After spending some time in a mental institution, he returns home but is still haunted by existential questions and he ultimately decides to join the army. Tony and Carmela come up with a movie set job to keep him from enlisting, with Tony promising he would one day finance A.J.&#x27;s nightclub. Dr. Melfi is convinced by colleagues that Tony is making no progress and may even be using talk therapy to excuse his own actions and as practice for manipulative behavior. She drops him as a patient and he fully quits therapy.

Johnny dies from lung cancer while imprisoned, and Phil officially takes over the Lupertazzi family after having his rivals killed. Phil renews his past feud with Tony and refuses to compromise with New Jersey on a garbage deal. When Tony assaults a Lupertazzi soldier for harassing Meadow while she was on a date, Phil initiates open war on the Soprano crew. He orders the executions of Bobby Baccalieri, who is shot to death; Silvio Dante, who ends up comatose; and Tony, who goes into hiding. Since Phil won&#x27;t back down until Tony is executed, a deal is eventually brokered whereby the rest of the Lupertazzi family agrees to ignore the hit on Tony, allowing him to go after Phil without fear of repercussions. FBI agent Dwight Harris informs Tony of Phil&#x27;s location, allowing Tony to have him killed.

Tony starts suspecting that Carlo Gervasi, a capo from New Jersey, has become an informant in an attempt to help out his son, who has recently been arrested for dealing ecstasy. Tony meets his lawyer, who informs him that subpoenas are being delivered to New Jersey and New York crews alike. Tony visits Uncle Junior for the first time since the shooting, and although he does not forgive him, he comes to understand the full extent of his dementia and that his uncle likely had not meant to kill him.

Tony plans to have a quiet dinner at a diner with his family. As Meadow arrives at the door, the camera cuts to Tony. A bell signals the door opening, Tony looks up and the show smash cuts to black; after a few seconds, the credits roll in silence.

===Ratings===
&quot;The Sopranos&quot; was a major ratings success throughout its run, despite being aired on premium cable network HBO, which had been available in significantly fewer American homes than regular networks. The show frequently attracted equal or larger audiences than most popular network shows of the time. The Nielsen ratings for the first four seasons are not entirely accurate, as Nielsen reported aggregate numbers for cable networks prior to January 2004, meaning that people who were included in the ratings estimates were actually watching HBO channels other than the main one on which &quot;The Sopranos&quot; aired.

===Critical response===
&quot;The Sopranos&quot; has been hailed by many critics as the greatest and most groundbreaking television series of all time. The writing, acting, and directing have often been singled out for praise. The show has also received considerable attention from critics and journalists for its technical merit, music selections, cinematography, and willingness to deal with difficult and controversial subjects including crime, family, gender roles, mental illness, and American and Italian-American culture.

&quot;The Sopranos&quot; is credited for creating a new era in the mafia genre deviating from the traditional dramatized image of the gangster in favor of a simpler, more accurate reflection of ordinary day-to-day mob life in a suburb. The series sheds light on Italian family dynamics through the depiction of Tony&#x27;s tumultuous relationship with his mother. Edie Falco&#x27;s character Carmela Soprano is praised in Kristyn Gorton&#x27;s essay &quot;Why I Love Carmela Soprano&quot; for challenging Italian-American gender roles. &quot;New Yorker&quot; editor David Remnick described &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as mirroring the &quot;mindless commerce and consumption&quot; of modern America. The series has an overall rating of 92 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, and 94 out of 100 on Metacritic.

&quot;The Sopranos&quot; has been called &quot;perhaps the greatest pop-culture masterpiece of its day&quot; by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; contributor Peter Biskind. Remnick called the show &quot;the richest achievement in the history of television.&quot;
In 2002, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Sopranos&quot; fifth on their list of the &quot;Top 50 TV Shows of All Time&quot;, while the series was only in its fourth season. In 2007, Channel 4 (UK) named &quot;The Sopranos&quot; the greatest television series of all time.

The first season of the series received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Following its initial airing in 1999, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;[&quot;The Sopranos&quot;] just may be the greatest work of American popular culture of the last quarter century.&quot; In 2007, Roger Holland of PopMatters wrote, &quot;the debut season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; remains the crowning achievement of American television.&quot;

&quot;Time Out New York&quot;″s Andrew Johnston had high praise for the series, stating: &quot;Together, Chase and his fellow writers (including Terence Winter and &quot;Mad Men&quot; creator Matthew Weiner) produced the legendary Great American Novel, and it&#x27;s 86 episodes long.&quot; Johnston asserted the preeminence of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as opposed to &quot;The Wire&quot; and &quot;Deadwood&quot; in a debate with television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz, both of whom would later include &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in their 2016 book titled &quot;TV (The Book)&quot; as the 2nd greatest American television series of all time, behind only &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and ahead of &quot;The Wire&quot;, with Seitz considering the show&#x27;s ending to be the greatest ending for any television show.

In November and December 2009, many television critics named &quot;The Sopranos&quot; the best series of the decade and all time in articles summarizing the decade in television. In numbered lists over the best television programs, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; frequently ranked first or second, almost always competing with &quot;The Wire&quot;. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Sopranos&quot; No. 2 in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time, In the same year, the Writers Guild of America named it the best-written television series of all time and &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it as the greatest show of all time.

A 2015 &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as their #6 favorite show. In 2016 and 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it first on the magazine&#x27;s list of 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In September 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the show first on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, stating that it &quot;hastened TV&#x27;s transformation into a medium where intelligence, experimentation and depth were treasured&quot; and describing it as &quot;something to aspire to&quot; for anyone currently making TV. In 2021, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;The Sopranos&quot; at number one on their list of The 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;The Sopranos&quot; #3 on its own list of the 100 greatest TV shows of all time.

Certain episodes have frequently been singled out by critics as the show&#x27;s best. These include the pilot, titled &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;College&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano&quot; of the first season; &quot;The Knight in White Satin Armor&quot; and &quot;Funhouse&quot; of the second; &quot;Employee of the Month&quot;, &quot;Pine Barrens&quot; and &quot;Amour Fou&quot; of the third; &quot;Whoever Did This&quot; and &quot;Whitecaps&quot; of the fourth; &quot;Irregular Around the Margins&quot; and &quot;Long Term Parking&quot; of the fifth and &quot;Members Only&quot;, &quot;Join the Club&quot;, &quot;Kennedy and Heidi&quot;, &quot;The Second Coming&quot;, &quot;The Blue Comet&quot; and &quot;Made in America&quot; of the sixth season.

Chase&#x27;s decision to end the last episode abruptly with just a black screen was controversial. While Chase has insisted that it was not his intention to stir controversy, the ambiguity over the ending and question of whether Tony was murdered has continued for years after the finale&#x27;s original broadcast and has spawned numerous websites devoted to finding out his true intention.

===Awards and nominations===

&quot;The Sopranos&quot; won and was nominated for many awards throughout its original broadcast. It was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in every year it was eligible and is the first cable TV series to receive a nomination for the award. After being nominated for and losing the award in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2003 (losing the first time to &quot;The Practice&quot; and the last three to &quot;The West Wing&quot;), &quot;The Sopranos&quot; won the award in 2004, and again in 2007. Its 2004 win made &quot;The Sopranos&quot; the first series on a cable network to win the award, while its 2007 win made the show the first drama series since &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; in 1977 to win the award after it had finished airing. The show earned 21 nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series and won the award six times, with creator David Chase receiving three awards. &quot;The Sopranos&quot; won American Film Institute&#x27;s Drama Series of the Year Award in 2001.

&quot;The Sopranos&quot; won at least one Emmy Award for acting in every eligible year except 2006 and 2007. James Gandolfini and Edie Falco were each nominated six times for Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress, respectively, both winning a total of three awards. Joe Pantoliano won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2003, and Michael Imperioli and Drea de Matteo also won Emmys in 2004 for their supporting roles on the show. Other actors who have received Emmy nominations for the series include Lorraine Bracco (in the Lead Actress and Supporting Actress categories), Dominic Chianese, Nancy Marchand, Aida Turturro, Tim Daly, John Heard, Annabella Sciorra and Steve Buscemi, who was also nominated for directing the episode &quot;Pine Barrens&quot;.

In 1999 and 2000, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; earned two consecutive George Foster Peabody Awards. Only two other series have won the award in consecutive years: &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; (1991 and 1992) and &quot;The West Wing&quot; (1999 and 2000). The show also received numerous nominations at the Golden Globe Awards (winning the award for Best Drama Series in 2000) and the major guild awards (Directors, Producers, Writers, and Actors).

In 2001, the American Psychoanalytic Association presented the producers and writers with an award for &quot;the artistic depiction of psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy&quot; and also presented Lorraine Bracco with an award for creating &quot;the most credible psychoanalyst ever to appear in the cinema or on television.&quot;

===Influence on television industry===
&quot;The Sopranos&quot; has been characterized by critics as one of the most influential artistic works of the 2000s and has been cited as helping to turn serial television into a legitimate art form on the same level as feature films, literature, and theater. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; editor James Poniewozik wrote in 2007, &quot;This mafia saga showed just how complex and involving TV storytelling could be, inspiring an explosion of ambitious dramas on cable and off.&quot;

Maureen Ryan of PopMatters described &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as the most influential television drama ever. &quot;No one-hour drama series has had a bigger impact on how stories are told on the small screen, or more influence on what kind of fare we&#x27;ve been offered by an ever-growing array of television networks.&quot;

Hal Boedeker stated in PopMatters in 2007 that the series was &quot;widely influential for revealing that cable would accommodate complex series about dark characters. &quot;The Sopranos&quot; ushered in &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;The Shield&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, and &quot;Big Love&quot;.&quot; &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; creator Vince Gilligan said in 2013 shortly after Gandolfini&#x27;s death, &quot;Without Tony Soprano, there would be no Walter White.&quot;

Weiner said that when he became a writer for &quot;The Sopranos&quot; after having written the &quot;Mad Men&quot; pilot, &quot;Whatever I had intended [&quot;Mad Men&quot;] to be ... was very different after seeing how seriously David Chase took human behavior. Real human behavior&quot;, giving &quot;Maidenform&quot; and how Peggy Olson&#x27;s baby affects her as examples.

The series helped establish HBO as producers of critically acclaimed and commercially successful original television series. Michael Flaherty of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; has stated that &quot;The Sopranos&quot; &quot;helped launch [HBO&#x27;s] reputation as a destination for talent looking for cutting-edge original series work.&quot;

===Depiction of stereotypes===
The show has frequently been accused of perpetuating negative stereotypes about Italian Americans. Several major organizations have voiced their concern that &quot;The Sopranos&quot; presents a very distorted and harmful stereotype of Italian Americans and their cultural values, including the National Italian American Foundation, Order Sons of Italy in America, Unico National, and the Italic Institute of America.

The show had a strong female cast and expressions of feminism during the six seasons. The creators challenge the traditional gender roles in society. Around the third season of the show, the creators were pushing the violence against women, highlighting the show&#x27;s impact on viewers and the ongoing debates surrounding its depiction of feminist issues. The show uses the Dr. Melfi rape episode to show the internal strength of the female perspective on the show, by not asking Tony for help to seek revenge.

In 2000, officials in Essex County, New Jersey, denied producers permission to film scenes in the South Mountain Reservation, which is county-owned property, by Essex County, New Jersey Executive James Treffinger, who argued that the show depicts Italian Americans &quot;in stereotypical fashion&quot;. In 2002, organizers of the New York City Columbus Day Parade won an injunction preventing Mayor Michael Bloomberg from inviting cast members of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; to participate in the parade.

Fairleigh Dickinson University&#x27;s PublicMind conducted a national survey in August 2001 that polled 800 people, out of which 37% said that they watched the show regularly, and 65% of this group (192 people, or 24% of the total) disagreed that the show negatively portrayed Italian Americans. Professor William Roberts, who was associated with the poll, said that &quot;The show&#x27;s inflated image of organized crime casts a shadow over both the state [of New Jersey] and its Italian American community.&quot;

He further stated &quot;The show helped to perpetuate one of the more problematic and stereotypical images of Italian Americans. Both Italian and Italian American cultures have much more diverse and interesting heritages than the American public generally realizes.&quot; Humanities professor Camille Paglia, herself an Italian American, has spoken negatively about &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, arguing that its depiction of Italian Americans was inaccurate, inauthentic, and dated.

Chase has defended his show, saying that &quot;It is not meant to stereotype all Italian Americans, only to depict a small criminal subculture&quot;.

===Parodies and commercials===
Actors from &quot;The Sopranos&quot; have reprised their roles, or at the very least parodied their roles, in various other media. Tony Sirico and Steve Schirripa appear in two separate Muppet-related Christmas specials, &quot;A Muppets Christmas: Letters to Santa&quot; and &quot;Elmo&#x27;s Christmas Countdown&quot;, parodying their roles on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Sirico also appeared in a series of commercials for Denny&#x27;s in-character as Paulie Gualtieri, a nod to the restaurant chain&#x27;s mention in &quot;Pine Barrens&quot;. James Gandolfini appeared on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; as a &quot;New Jersey Resident&quot; on the October 2, 2004, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to comment on the recent resignation of New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey. Gandolfini&#x27;s character went unnamed, and hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler insisted at the segment&#x27;s conclusion that he was &quot;unidentified&quot;, but the character was clearly meant to be Tony Soprano.

====2022 Chevrolet commercial====
Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Robert Iler reprised their roles as Meadow and A.J. Soprano in a Chevrolet television commercial initially broadcast in 2022 during Super Bowl LVI. David Chase directed the commercial and treated it as a continuation of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; story. At Chase&#x27;s insistence, former &quot;Sopranos&quot; director of photography Phil Abraham performed the filming. The ad recreates the opening-title sequence of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, with Meadow driving a Silverado EV (as opposed to Tony&#x27;s Chevrolet Suburban) and meeting A.J. at Bahrs Landing, featured in &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;. Along the way, she passes some &quot;Sopranos&quot; landmarks including Satriale&#x27;s. Chase wanted the commercial to continue the intrigue surrounding &quot;The Sopranos&quot; finale: besides the visual allusion to the episode with Meadow&#x27;s parking, Chase intentionally left open why Meadow and A.J. were at the restaurant and who they could be meeting there.

==Merchandise==
===Home media===
The first four seasons of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; were released on VHS in five-volume box sets which lack bonus material.

*&quot;The Sopranos: A Family History&quot; (2000) discusses the history of the fictional crime family and Tony Soprano&#x27;s childhood, while providing photos, information about the &quot;Sopranos&quot; cast, and a synopsis of the show&#x27;s first two seasons. Second and third editions of the book were later released, which provide updates through the show&#x27;s third and fourth seasons, respectively.
*&quot;The Sopranos Family Cookbook (As Compiled by Artie Bucco)&quot; (2002) features Southern Italian recipes (from cookbook author Michele Scicolone), photos, and additional lore from the series.
*&quot;Entertaining with the Sopranos (As Compiled by Carmela Soprano)&quot; (2006) features Neapolitan-based recipes (from Michele Scicolone) and &quot;Soprano-approved tips&quot; on &quot;picking the ideal location, choosing tasteful decorations, whipping up the best drinks, and selecting the right music.&quot;
On September 17, 2020, Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa signed a deal with HarperCollins book imprint William Morrow and Company to write an oral history of the show; the book, titled &quot;Woke Up This Morning: The Definitive Oral History of The Sopranos&quot;, was released on November 2, 2021.

===Soundtracks===

Two official soundtrack compilations were released featuring music used in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;:
*&quot;The Sopranos: Music from the HBO Original Series&quot; (1999) contains music selections from the show&#x27;s first two seasons. 
*&quot;The Sopranos: Peppers &amp; Eggs – Music from the HBO Original Series&quot; (2001) contains music selections and character dialogue from the show&#x27;s first three seasons.

===Video game and pinball===

A video game based on the series, titled &quot;The Sopranos: Road to Respect&quot;, was developed by 7 Studios and released by THQ for the PlayStation 2 in November 2006. The game features the voices and likenesses of key &quot;Sopranos&quot; cast members.

In 2005, Stern Pinball released a &quot;Sopranos&quot; pinball machine designed by George Gomez.

===Podcasts===
Several cast members of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; have started podcasts regarding the series. Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa began hosting a podcast called &quot;Talking Sopranos&quot; on April 6, 2020, where the two provide inside info as they follow &quot;The Sopranos&quot; series episode-by-episode and interview cast and crew from the series. By September 2020, the podcast had reached over five million downloads. In May 2021, the podcast won a Webby Award for Best Television &amp; Film Podcast by method of &quot;People&#x27;s Voice Winner&quot;.

Drea de Matteo and Chris Kushner began hosting a re-watch podcast on March 13, 2020, called &quot;Made Women&quot;; in July, the podcast was retooled and renamed &quot;Gangster Goddess Broad-Cast&quot;.

==Film==

In March 2018, New Line Cinema announced that they had purchased a film detailing &quot;The Sopranos&quot; background story, set in the 1960s and &#x27;70s during, and in the wake of, the Newark riots. The 2021 film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;, was written by David Chase and Lawrence Konner and directed by Alan Taylor. Alessandro Nivola was cast in the film as Christopher Moltisanti&#x27;s father Dickie, and Michael Gandolfini, James Gandolfini&#x27;s son, as the younger version of Tony Soprano. Vera Farmiga, Jon Bernthal, Ray Liotta, Corey Stoll, Billy Magnussen and John Magaro are other cast members.

The film was initially scheduled to be released on September 25, 2020, however, the film&#x27;s release was delayed multiple times due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; it was released on October 1, 2021, in theaters and on HBO Max.

Chase has expressed interest in producing a sequel to &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot; that follows Tony Soprano in his 20s, provided he could collaborate with former &quot;Sopranos&quot; writer Terence Winter. Upon hearing this, Winter replied he would do it &quot;in a heartbeat. Absolutely.&quot;

<doc id="78248" wikidata="Q885741" url="?curid=78248" title="Blue Jacket">
<text>Blue Jacket, or Weyapiersenwah (c. 1743 – 1810), was a war chief of the Shawnee people, known for his militant defense of Shawnee lands in the Ohio Country. Perhaps the preeminent American Indian leader in the Northwest Indian War, in which a pantribal confederacy fought several battles with the nascent United States, he was an important predecessor of the famous Shawnee leader Tecumseh.

==Early life==
Little is known of Blue Jacket&#x27;s early life. He first appears in written historical records in 1773, when he was already a grown man and a war chief. In that year, a British missionary visited the Shawnee villages on the Scioto River and recorded the location of Blue Jacket&#x27;s Town on Deer Creek (present-day Ross County, Ohio).

==Struggle for the Old Northwest==
Blue Jacket participated in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War and the American Revolutionary War (allied with the British), always attempting to maintain Shawnee land rights. With the British defeat in the American Revolutionary War, the Shawnee lost valuable assistance in defending the Ohio Country. The struggle continued as white settlement in Ohio escalated, and Blue Jacket was a prominent leader of the resistance. He was present during the 1790 Harmar campaign and may have been one of the leaders who organized the defense. 

On November 3, 1791, the army of a confederation of Indian tribes, led by Blue Jacket and Miami Chief Little Turtle, defeated an American expedition led by Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory. The engagement, known as the Battle of the Wabash or St. Clair&#x27;s defeat, was the crowning achievement of Blue Jacket&#x27;s military career and the most severe defeat ever inflicted upon the United States by Native Americans. Traditional accounts of the battle tend to give most of the credit for the victory to Little Turtle. John Sugden argues that Little Turtle&#x27;s prominence is primarily because of Little Turtle&#x27;s self-promotion in later years.

Blue Jacket&#x27;s triumph was short-lived. The Americans were alarmed by St. Clair&#x27;s disaster and raised a new professional army, commanded by General Anthony Wayne. On August 20, 1794, Blue Jacket&#x27;s confederate army clashed with Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, just south of present-day Toledo, Ohio. Blue Jacket&#x27;s army was defeated, and he was compelled to sign the Treaty of Greenville on August 3, 1795, ceding much of present-day Ohio to the United States.

In 1805, Blue Jacket also signed the Treaty of Fort Industry, relinquishing even more of Ohio. In Blue Jacket&#x27;s final years, he saw the rise to prominence of Tecumseh, who would take up the banner and make the final attempts to reclaim Shawnee lands in the Ohio Country.

==Van Swearingen legend==
In 1877, decades after Blue Jacket&#x27;s death, a story was published which claimed that Blue Jacket had actually been a white man named Marmaduke Van Swearingen who had been captured and adopted by Shawnees in the 1770s, around the time of the American Revolutionary War. This story was popularized in historical novels written by Allan W. Eckert in the late 1960s. An outdoor drama based on the Van Swearingen story, &quot;Blue Jacket, White Shawnee War Chief&quot;, was performed in Xenia, Ohio, beginning in 1981. Performances of the play ended in 2007.

Beginning with historian Helen Hornbeck Tanner in 1978, a number of historians have argued that Blue Jacket and Van Swearingen were not likely to be the same person. The historical record indicates that Blue Jacket was much older than Marmaduke Van Swearingen and was already an established chief by the time Van Swearingen was supposedly captured. Furthermore, no one who personally knew Blue Jacket left any records referring to him as a white man. According to Blue Jacket biographer John Sugden, Blue Jacket was undoubtedly a Shawnee by birth.

DNA testing of the descendants of Blue Jacket and Van Swearingen has given additional support to the argument that Blue Jacket was not Van Swearingen. After an initial test in 2000, results of a DNA test using updated equipment and techniques was published in the September 2006 edition of &quot;The Ohio Journal of Science&quot;. The researchers tested DNA samples from four men descended from Charles Swearingen, Marmaduke&#x27;s brother, and six who are descended from Blue Jacket&#x27;s son George Blue-Jacket. The DNA from the two families did not match, and so the study concluded that, &quot;Barring any questions of the paternity of the Chief&#x27;s single son who lived to produce male heirs, the &#x27;Blue Jacket with-Caucasian-roots&#x27; is not based on reality.&quot;

<text>Damon Graham Devereux Hill (born 17 September 1960) is a British former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Hill won the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship in with Williams, and won 22 Grands Prix across eight seasons.

Born and raised in London, Hill is the son of two-time Formula One World Champion Graham Hill, and, along with Nico Rosberg, one of two sons of a Formula One World Champion to also win the title. He started racing on motorbikes in 1981, and after minor success moved on to single-seater racing cars. Hill became a test driver for the Formula One title-winning Williams team in 1992. He was promoted to the Williams race team the following year after Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s departure and took the first of his 22 victories at the 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix. During the mid-1990s, Hill was Michael Schumacher&#x27;s main rival for the Formula One Drivers&#x27; Championship, which saw the two clash several times on and off the track. Their collision at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix gave Schumacher his first title by a single point. Hill became champion in with eight wins, but was dropped by Williams for the following season. He went on to drive for the less competitive Arrows and Jordan teams, and in gave Jordan their first win.

Hill retired from racing after being dropped by Jordan following the season. In 2006, he became president of the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club, succeeding Jackie Stewart. Hill stepped down from the position in 2011 and was succeeded by Derek Warwick. He presided over the securing of a 17-year contract for Silverstone to hold Formula One races, which enabled the circuit to see extensive renovation work. Hill formerly worked as part of the Sky Sports F1 broadcasting support team providing expert analysis during free practice sessions.

==Personal and early life==
Hill was born in Hampstead, London, to Graham and Bette Hill. Graham Hill was a racing driver in the international Formula One series. He won the world Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1962 and 1968, and became a well-known personality in the United Kingdom. Graham Hill&#x27;s career provided a comfortable living. Bette (née Shubrook) was a former rower and medalist at the European Rowing Championships. By 1975 the family lived in a &quot;25-room country mansion&quot; in Hertfordshire and Damon attended the independent The Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School. The death of his father in an aeroplane crash in 1975 left the 15-year-old Hill, his mother, and sisters Samantha and Brigitte in drastically reduced circumstances. Hill worked as a labourer and a motorcycle courier to support his further education.

Hill is married to Susan &quot;Georgie&quot; George and they have four children, including Joshua. One son was born with Down syndrome and Hill and Georgie are both patrons of the Down&#x27;s Syndrome Association. In 2009, Hill also became the first patron of St. Joseph&#x27;s Specialist School and College, a school for children with severe learning disabilities and autism in Cranleigh, Surrey. Joshua started racing in 2008, competing in the British Formula Renault Championship in 2011. Joshua retired from motor racing in 2013.

Hill is the Patron of the charity Disability Africa which runs inclusion projects for disabled children in African countries.

==Career==

===Pre-Formula One===

Hill started his motorsport career in motorcycle racing in 1981. He used the same simple, easily identifiable helmet design as his father: eight white oar blades arranged vertically around the upper surface of a dark blue helmet. The device and colours represent the London Rowing Club for which Graham Hill rowed in the early 1950s. Although he won a 350 cc clubman&#x27;s championship at the Brands Hatch circuit, his racing budget came from working as a building labourer. He also worked as a dispatch rider for Apollo Despatch in London, then later Special Delivery, a London motorcycle dispatch company and was provided TZ350 racing bikes by them. His mother, who was concerned about the dangers of racing motorcycles, persuaded him to take a racing car course at the Winfield Racing School in France in 1983. Although he showed &quot;above-average aptitude&quot;, Hill had only sporadic single-seater races until the end of 1984. He graduated through British Formula Ford, winning six races driving a Van Diemen for Manadient Racing in 1985, his first full season in cars, and finishing third and fifth in the two UK national championships. He also took third place in the final of the 1985 Formula Ford Festival, helping the UK to win the team prize.

For 1986, Hill planned to move up to the British Formula Three Championship with title-winning team West Surrey Racing. The loss of sponsorship from Ricoh, and then the death of his proposed teammate Bertrand Fabi in a testing accident, ended Hill&#x27;s proposed drive. Hill says &quot;When Bert was killed, I took the conscious decision that I wasn&#x27;t going to stop doing that sort of thing. It&#x27;s not just competing, it&#x27;s doing something more exciting. I&#x27;m at my fullest skiing, racing or whatever. And I&#x27;m more frightened of letting it all slip and reaching 60 and finding I&#x27;ve done nothing.&quot; Hill borrowed £100,000 to finance his racing thanks to a sponsorship deal with Cellnet, as he explained to the &quot;Fuelling Around&quot; podcast. The deal involved the sales expertise of David Hunt, brother of F1 driver James Hunt. He had a steady first season for Murray Taylor Racing in 1986 before taking a brace of wins in each of the following years for Intersport. 

During the 1987 season, he made the odd appearance in various one-make tin-top racing series, including MG Metro Turbos, MG Maestros and Saab 900 Turbos, notably finishing 3rd at Silverstone in the Maestro series, after fighting for the lead with Gary Brabham early on, and winning at Brands Hatch in the Saab series as a substitute for Tiff Needell. He finished third in the 1988 British F3 championship.

In Europe in the 1990s, a successful driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, the pinnacle of the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, for 1989, Hill did not have enough sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says &quot;I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever I drove I would do it to the best of my ability and see where it led.&quot; He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228 laps. He also competed in a one hour Endurance race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, co-driving the Ford Sierra RS500 usually driven by Sean Walker, the pair finished 4th. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 14th place, Hill&#x27;s race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.

===Formula One===

====Brabham (1992)====
Hill started his Grand Prix career during the 1991 season as a test driver with the championship-winning Williams team while still competing in the F3000 series. However, midway through Hill broke into Grand Prix racing as a driver with the dying Brabham team. The formerly competitive team was in serious financial difficulties. Hill started the season only after three races, replacing Giovanna Amati after her sponsorship had failed to materialise. Amati had been unable to get the car through qualifying but Hill matched his teammate, Eric van de Poele, by qualifying for two races, the mid-season British and Hungarian Grands Prix. Hill continued to test for the Williams team that year and the British Grand Prix saw Nigel Mansell win the race for Williams, while he finished last in the Brabham. The Brabham team collapsed after the Hungarian Grand Prix and did not complete the season.

====Williams (1993–96)====
When Mansell&#x27;s teammate Riccardo Patrese left Williams to drive for Benetton in , Hill was unexpectedly promoted to the race team alongside triple World Champion Alain Prost ahead of more experienced candidates such as Martin Brundle and Mika Häkkinen. Traditionally, the reigning driver&#x27;s World Champion carried the number &quot;1&quot; on his car and his teammate took the number &quot;2&quot;. Because Mansell, the 1992 champion, was not racing in Formula One in 1993, Williams as Constructors&#x27; Champion were given numbers &quot;0&quot; and &quot;2&quot;. As the junior partner to Prost, Hill took &quot;0&quot;, the second man in Formula One history to do so, after Jody Scheckter in 1973.

;1993
The season did not start well when Hill spun out of second place shortly after the start of the and failed to finish the race after colliding with Alessandro Zanardi on lap 17. At the , Hill qualified and spent the early stages of the race running second behind Prost, and then took the lead when Prost crashed, but was relegated back to second by another three-time World Champion, Ayrton Senna. Nevertheless, the race still gave Hill his first podium finish.

In the next round in Europe, Hill again finished second behind Senna and ahead of a lapped Prost. In his first full season, Hill benefited from the experience of his veteran French teammate. He continued to impress as the season went on, and in San Marino Hill took the lead at the start, though he was passed by Prost and Senna and ultimately retired with a spin due to a brake failure. Mechanical problems returned in Spain where he kept pace with Prost for most of the race only for his engine to fail.

After strong podiums in Monaco and Canada, Hill took his first career pole in France, finishing second to Prost after team orders prevented him from seriously challenging for the win. He looked set to win the before another engine failure put him out and led the comfortably only to suffer a puncture with two laps left, handing the win to Prost.

At the Hungarian race, Hill did take his first career win after leading from start to finish. In doing so he became the first son of a Formula One Grand Prix winner to take victory himself, and he followed it with two more wins, first at Spa where he took the lead following a pit stop problem for Prost, and then at the where Prost&#x27;s engine failed towards the end. His third consecutive win clinched the Constructors&#x27; Championship for Williams and moved him temporarily to second in the Drivers&#x27; standings. At the Hill came from the back of the grid to third, having stalled on the warm up lap from pole. He finished the season by finishing fourth in Japan and third in Australia, though he lost second in the Drivers&#x27; Championship to Ayrton Senna, who passed Hill by winning the last two races.

;1994
In , Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As the reigning champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill retained his number &#x27;0&#x27;. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, but the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the on 1 May, Senna died after his car crashed into a concrete barrier while he was leading. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season&#x27;s experience in the top flight. It was widely reported at the time that the Williams car&#x27;s steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.
Hill represented Williams alone at the next race, the . His race ended early in a collision involving several cars on the opening lap of the race. For the following race, the , Williams&#x27;s test driver David Coulthard was promoted to the race team alongside Hill, who won the race just four weeks after Senna&#x27;s death.

Schumacher led by 66 points to 29 by the midpoint of the season. At the , Frank Williams brought back Nigel Mansell, for the French, European, Japanese and Australian Grands Prix with Coulthard doing the majority of the 1994 season. Mansell earned approximately £900,000 for each of his four races, while Hill was paid £300,000 for the entire season, though Hill&#x27;s position as lead driver remained unquestioned. Hill came back into contention for the title after winning the , a race his father had never won. Schumacher was disqualified from that race and banned for two further races for overtaking Hill during the formation lap and ignoring the subsequent black flag. Four more victories for Hill, three of which were in races where Schumacher was excluded or disqualified, took the title battle to the final event at Adelaide. At Schumacher&#x27;s first race since his ban, the , he suggested that Hill (who was eight years his senior) was not a world-class driver. However, during the penultimate race at the , Hill took victory ahead of Schumacher in a rain-soaked event. This put Hill just one point behind the German before the last race of the season.

Neither Hill nor Schumacher finished the season-closing , after a controversial collision which gave the title to Schumacher. Schumacher ran off the track hitting the wall with the right-hand side of his Benetton while leading. Coming into the sixth corner Hill moved to pass the Benetton and the two collided, breaking the Williams&#x27;s front left suspension wishbone, and forcing both drivers&#x27; retirement from the race. BBC Formula One commentator Murray Walker, had often maintained that Schumacher did not cause the crash intentionally, but Williams co-owner Patrick Head felt differently. In 2006 he said that at the time of the incident &quot;Williams were already 100% certain that Michael was guilty of foul play&quot; but did not protest Schumacher&#x27;s title because the team was still dealing with the death of Ayrton Senna. In 2007, Hill explicitly accused Schumacher of causing the collision deliberately.

Hill&#x27;s season earned him the 1994 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

;1995
Coming into the 1995 season, Hill was one of the title favourites. The Williams team were reigning Constructors&#x27; Champions, having beaten Benetton in 1994, and with young David Coulthard, who was embarking on his first full season in Formula One, as teammate, Hill was the clear number one driver. The year seemed to start well with pole position in Brazil, although a spin while in the lead due to a mechanical problem handed the lead to Schumacher. But wins in the next two races put him in the championship lead. However, Schumacher won seven of the next twelve races, and took his second title with two races to spare, while Benetton took the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Schumacher and Hill had several on-track incidents during the season, two of which led to suspended one-race bans for both. Schumacher&#x27;s penalty was for blocking and forcing Hill off the road at the ; Hill&#x27;s was for colliding with Schumacher under braking at the . Hill&#x27;s season finished positively when he won the by finishing two laps ahead of the runner-up, Olivier Panis in a Ligier.

;1996
In the Williams car was clearly the quickest in Formula One and Hill went on to win the title ahead of his teammate, reigning Indycar champion Jacques Villeneuve, becoming the first son of a Formula One champion to win the championship himself. Taking eight wins and never qualifying off the front row, Hill enjoyed by far his most successful season. At Monaco, where his father had won five times in the 1960s, he led until his engine failed, curtailing his race and allowing Olivier Panis to take his only Formula One win. Near the end of the season, Villeneuve began to mount a title challenge and took pole in the Japanese Grand Prix, the final race of the year. However, Hill took the lead at the start and won both the race and the championship while the Canadian retired. Hill equalled the record for starting all 16 races of the season from the front row, matching Ayrton Senna in and Alain Prost in 1993.

Despite winning the title, Hill learned before the season&#x27;s close that he was to be dropped by Williams in favour of Heinz-Harald Frentzen for the following season. Hill left Williams as the team&#x27;s second most successful driver in terms of race victories, with 21, second only to Mansell. Hill&#x27;s 1996 World Championship earned him his second BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award, making him one of only five people to receive the award twice – the others being boxer Henry Cooper, Nigel Mansell, Andy Murray and Lewis Hamilton. Hill was also awarded the Segrave Trophy by the Royal Automobile Club. The trophy is awarded to the British national who accomplishes the most outstanding demonstration of the possibilities of transport by land, sea, air, or water.

====Arrows (1997)====
Hill became the fourth driver in nine years to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship for Williams and not drive for the team the following season, as occurred with Nelson Piquet ( champion – driver for Lotus), Nigel Mansell (1992 champion – 1993 driver in the US-based Indy Car World Series instead of F1) and Alain Prost (1993 champion – retired in 1994). As World Champion, Hill was in high demand and had offers for a race seat from McLaren, Benetton and Ferrari but not adequately financially valued despite his status. As a consequence, he opted to sign for Arrows, a team which had never won a race in its 20-year history and had scored only a single point the previous year. Hill&#x27;s title defence in proved unsuccessful, getting off to a poor start when he only narrowly qualified for the and then retired on the parade lap. The Arrows car, which used tyres from series debutant Bridgestone and previously unproven Yamaha engines, was generally uncompetitive, and Hill did not score his first point for the team until the at Silverstone in July. His best result for the year then came at the . On a day when the Bridgestone tyres had a competitive edge over their Goodyear rivals, Hill qualified third in a car that had not previously placed higher than 9th on the grid. During the race, he passed his rival and new championship contender, Michael Schumacher, on the track and was leading late in the race, 35 seconds ahead of the eventual 1997 World Champion, Villeneuve, until a hydraulic problem drastically slowed the Arrows. Villeneuve thus passed Hill, who finished second.

====Jordan (1998–99)====
Only after one year with Arrows, Hill came close to signing a deal with Alain Prost&#x27;s team, before deciding to instead sign up with the Jordan team for the 1998 season. His new teammate was Ralf Schumacher, younger brother of Michael. In the first half of the season, the Jordan 198 car was off the pace and unreliable until improvements in performance from the . During that race, Hill progressed to second place as others retired or made pit stops for fuel. On lap 38, Michael Schumacher, who was delayed by a stop-and-go penalty after forcing Frentzen&#x27;s Williams off the track, caught Hill on the home straight; Hill moved across the track three times to block Schumacher, who took the place by running over the kerbs at the last chicane. Hill then ran fourth after his only pit stop before retiring due to an electrical failure. After the race, Schumacher accused Hill of dangerous driving. Hill responded by stating that Schumacher &quot;cannot claim anyone drives badly when you look at the things he&#x27;s been up to in his career. He took Frentzen out completely.&quot; At the , Hill scored his first point of the year and at the , in very wet conditions, he took the Jordan team&#x27;s maiden win. At that race, Hill was leading late in the race, with teammate Schumacher closing rapidly, when he asked the team whether they would be allowed to race each other. Team principal Eddie Jordan ordered Ralf Schumacher to hold position instead of risking losing a 1–2 finish. The victory was his first since being dropped by the Williams team. Hill finished the season with a last lap pass on Frentzen at the , which earned him fourth place in the race and Jordan fourth position in that year&#x27;s Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Hopes were high for , but Hill did not enjoy a good season. Struggling with the newly introduced four-grooved tyres, he was outpaced by his new teammate, Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who was Hill&#x27;s replacement at Williams two years prior. After a crash at the , Hill announced plans to retire from the sport at the end of the year, but after failing to finish the that Frentzen won, he considered quitting the sport immediately.

Jordan persuaded Hill to at least stay for the . Going into that race weekend, Hill announced he would retire after the Grand Prix, leading Jordan to test Jos Verstappen in case Hill had to be quickly replaced. Following a strong fifth place at his home event, however, Hill changed his mind and decided to see out the year. His best result for the remainder of the season was sixth place, which he achieved in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 to go, there were rumours that the Prost Grand Prix team would release Jarno Trulli early after he signed for Jordan&#x27;s campaign as Hill&#x27;s replacement. At the same time, his teammate, Frentzen, became a title contender going into the final few races of the season and, eventually, finished third in the championship. In so doing, both Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to achieve its best-ever finish with a third position in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. Hill&#x27;s last race was the where he spun off the track and pulled into the pit lane citing mental fatigue.

==After racing==

In retirement Hill has continued to be involved with cars and motorsport. He founded the Prestige and Super Car Private Members Club P1 International with Michael Breen in 2000; Breen bought Hill out in October 2006. Hill also became involved in a BMW dealership, just outside Royal Leamington Spa, that bore his name and an Audi dealership in Exeter. In April 2006, Hill succeeded Jackie Stewart as President of the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club (BRDC). He presided over the securing of a 17-year contract for Silverstone to hold Formula One races, which enabled the circuit to see extensive renovation work.

In 2009 he received an Honorary Fellowship from the University of Northampton recognising his successful career and his connection with Northampton through Silverstone and the BRDC.

Hill also made a UK television advert with F1 commentator Murray Walker for Pizza Hut, in which Walker commentated on Hill&#x27;s meal as if it were a race. Hill has also appeared on many British television programmes, including &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;This is Your Life&quot;, &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; and &quot;Bang Bang, It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot;.

Hill has raced both cars and motorcycles at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, and in 2005 he tested the new GP2 Series car. He drove the Grand Prix Masters single seater racing vehicle for a test run around the Silverstone Circuit in mid-2006. He had discussions to join the series limited to retired Formula One drivers who were aged 45 or over but these talks did not materialise in a drive. Hill served as the driver representative on the stewards&#x27; panel at the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix which decided to penalize Hill&#x27;s former rival Michael Schumacher for overtaking under yellow flag conditions. The decision led to Hill receiving hate mail.

Between 18 and 19 May 2012, Hill along with Mark Blundell, Perry McCarthy, Martin Donnelly and Julian Bailey participated in the first round of the VW Scirocco R-Cup at Brands Hatch to raise funds for the Halow Charity. Hill completed seven laps of the circuit before retiring. On 7 October 2012, Hill drove his father&#x27;s BRM in celebration of the 50th anniversary of having won the 1962 F1 World Championship. In June 2018, Hill became the President of the Brooklands Trust Members who are the support group for Brooklands Museum.

Hill published his autobiography, &quot;Watching the Wheels&quot;, in 2016, in which he revealed he had suffered with depression.

===Broadcaster===

Hill has frequently appeared in the British media. In June 1975, he appeared alongside his father on the television programme &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot;. He again appeared on the programme in January 1995, marking the twentieth anniversary of the show. He has contributed many articles to &quot;F1 Racing&quot; magazine and has twice appeared in ITV F1&#x27;s commentary box, covering for Martin Brundle at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2007 and 2008. British Sky Broadcasting signed Hill to join their Formula One presentation team on Sky Sports F1 as a pundit starting from the 2012 Formula One World Championship. Hill resigned after the 2024 São Paulo Grand Prix, having worked as an analyst across 13 seasons.

===Music career===
Hill was interested in music from an early age and formed the punk band the &quot;Hormones&quot; with some friends while at school. After achieving success in Formula One, he was able to play guitar with several famous musicians, including his friend George Harrison, and appeared on &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, the opening track of Def Leppard&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Euphoria&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m quite proud of that one to be honest&quot;, Hill told the &quot;Fuelling Around&quot; podcast. &quot;You can actually hear my guitar as they fade it out towards the end of the song. I think it fits well with the track and it went platinum!&quot;

Hill also made a regular appearance at the British Grand Prix alongside other Formula One musicians such as Eddie Jordan. After his retirement at the end of the 1999 season, Hill devoted more time to music and played with celebrity bands including Spike Edney&#x27;s SAS band, and Pat Cash&#x27;s Wild Colonial Boys. Hill also formed his own band, The Conrods, which was active between 1999 and 2003 and played cover versions of well-known songs from The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and The Kinks. Since becoming president of the BRDC in 2006, Hill says he has stopped playing the guitar, being &quot;too busy doing school runs and looking after pets.&quot;

<doc id="78255" wikidata="Q132453" url="?curid=78255" title="Developed country">
<text>A developed country, or advanced country, is a sovereign state that has a high quality of life, developed economy, and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are the gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living. Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. Different definitions of developed countries are provided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank; moreover, HDI ranking is used to reflect the composite index of life expectancy, education, and income per capita. In 2024, 40 countries fit all three criteria, while an additional 20 countries fit two out of three.

Developed countries have generally more advanced post-industrial economies, meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector. They are contrasted with developing countries, which are in the process of industrialisation or are pre-industrial and almost entirely agrarian, some of which might fall into the category of Least Developed Countries. , advanced economies comprise 57.3% of global GDP based on nominal values and 41.1% of global GDP based on purchasing-power parity (PPP) according to the IMF.

== Definition and criteria ==
Economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions. One such criterion is the income per capita; countries with the high gross domestic product (GDP) per capita would thus be described as developed countries. Another economic criterion is industrialisation; countries in which the tertiary and quaternary sectors of industry dominate would thus be described as developed. More recently, another measure, the Human Development Index (HDI), which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high (HDI) rating. The index, however, does not take into account several factors, such as the net wealth per capita or the relative quality of goods in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking of some of the most advanced countries, such as the G7 members and others.

According to the United Nations Statistics Division:
There is no established convention for the designation of &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; countries or areas in the United Nations system.

And it notes that:
The designations &quot;developed&quot; and &quot;developing&quot; are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.

Nevertheless, the UN Trade and Development considers that this categorization can continue to be applied:
The developed economies broadly comprise Northern America and Europe, Israel, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.

=== Similar terms ===

Terms linked to the concept &quot;developed country&quot; include &quot;advanced country&quot;, &quot;industrialized country&quot;, &quot;more developed country&quot; (MDC), &quot;more economically developed country&quot; (MEDC), &quot;Global North country&quot;, &quot;first world country&quot;, and &quot;post-industrial country&quot;. The term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous, as industrialisation is an ongoing process that is hard to define. The first industrialized country was the United Kingdom, followed by Belgium. Later it spread further to Germany, United States, France and other Western European countries. According to some economists such as Jeffrey Sachs, however, the current divide between the developed and developing world is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century.

Mathis Wackernagel calls the binary labeling of countries as &quot;neither descriptive nor explanatory. It is merely a thoughtless and destructive endorsement of GDP fetish. In reality, there are not two types of countries, but over 200 countries, all faced with the same laws of nature, yet each with unique features.&quot;

A 2021 analysis proposes the term &quot;emerged&quot; to describe markets, economies, or countries that have graduated from emerging market status, but have not yet reached the level equivalent to developed countries. Multinational corporations from these emerging markets present unique patterns of overseas expansion and knowledge acquisition from foreign countries.

== Economy lists by various criteria ==

=== Human Development Index (HDI) ===


The UN HDI is a statistical measure that gauges an economy&#x27;s level of human development. While there is a strong correlation between having a high HDI score and being a prosperous economy, the UN points out that the HDI accounts for more than income or productivity. Unlike GDP per capita or per capita income, the HDI takes into account how income is turned &quot;into education and health opportunities and therefore into higher levels of human development.&quot;

Since 1990, Norway (2001–2006, 2009–2019), Japan (1990–1991 and 1993), Canada (1992 and 1994–2000) and Iceland (2007–2008) have had the highest HDI score.

The following countries in the year 2022 are considered to be of &quot;very high human development&quot;:


=== &quot;WESP&quot; developed economies ===
According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs&#x27; &quot;World Economic Situation and Prospects&quot; report, the following 37 countries are classified as &quot;developed economies&quot; as of January 2024:

four countries in Asia and the Pacific:
=== World Bank high-income economies===

<doc id="78258" wikidata="Q188839" url="?curid=78258" title="Flag of Aruba">
<text>The national flag of Aruba was adopted on 18 March 1976, along with the official anthem &quot;Aruba Dushi Tera&quot;. The flag was partially designed by vexillologist Whitney Smith. On 18 March Aruba celebrates National Anthem and Flag Day, marked by local events across the island. It is also a significant day as it represents the Kingdom of the Netherlands giving Aruba an autonomous status.
==Description==
The flag is rectangular and features four colors: yellow, blue, red, and white. Its width-to-length ratio is 2:3. The field color of the flag is Larkspur, identified as &quot;no. 196&quot; in the British colour council&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Colour Standards&quot; or PMS 279 C in the Pantone Matching System. The lower 1/3 of the flag is divided into three horizontal bands of equal width, colored yellow, blue, and yellow respectively. Each strip&#x27;s width is 1/18 of the flag&#x27;s total width. The top band starts 2/3 of the way down from the top of the flag. The yellow stripes are in PMS 109 C, and the middle band is colored PMS 279 C. Below these three bands is a wide border, 1/6 of the flag&#x27; width, in PMS 279 C. In the canton or upper hoisting plane of the flag, there is a regular four-pointed star. The star&#x27;s horizontal and vertical meridians align with the flag&#x27;s edges, and a line drawn from any inner corner through the center to the opposite inner corner is 1/3 length of the stars&#x27; horizontal or vertical median. The star is colored red, PMS 032 C, with a white border (fimbration). The total length of the star, including the fringe, is 1/3 of the flag&#x27;s width. The highest point of the star is positioned inward from the hoist edge at a distance equal to 1/18 of the flag&#x27;s width.

== Symbolism ==
The flag of Aruba incorporates four colors and symbols, each carrying significance. The light blue color represents the sea surrounding the island, symbolizing its strong connection to the ocean.

Yellow signifies abundance and solidarity. The horizontal lines symbolize the economic prosperity derived from industries like gold mining and Aloe Vera production in the past, as well as the current reliance on tourism. Yellow also represents the vibrant yellow flowers of local flora such as the “Kibrahacha” (Tabebuia billbergii), “Palo di Brazil&quot; (Haematoxylon brasiletto), “Bonchi di Strena” (Parkinsonia aculeata), “Curahout” (Peltophorum acutifolium), “Tuturutu” (Yellow Dwarf Poincianas, Caesalpinia pulcherrima) and “Wanglo” (Puncture vine Tribulus cistoides). 

The horizontal yellow stripes on the flag symbolize Aruba&#x27;s freedom and distinct status within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, achieved on 1 January 1986.

Additionally, the color white on the flag symbolizes peace and carries symbolic meaning. It represents the island&#x27;s pristine beaches and signifies the purity of the hearts of the Aruban people, who strive for justice, order, and liberty.

The red star on the flag symbolizes the four points of the compass, symbolizing the diverse origins of the Aruban population, which attracts people from around the world. It also represents Aruba itself, surrounded by the blue sea and the historic &quot;Palo di Brazil&quot; industry. Red symbolizes love and pays tribute to the indigenous Arubans who lost their lives during the confrontation with the French at Frenchman&#x27;s pass.

== Governor&#x27;s standard ==
The governor of Aruba, as the representative of the Monarch of the Netherlands, has a specific standard. According to the &quot;Album des pavillons&quot;, the flag of the governor of Aruba consists of a white field with three horizontal stripes along the top and bottom, colored red, white, and blue. Each stripe occupies 1/12th of the flag&#x27;s height. In the center of the flag, there is a light blue disk with a diameter equal to 5/12th the flag&#x27;s height. On the disk, the red, white-bordered star and two yellow stripes from the flag of Aruba are placed. The center of the star is positioned at the horizontal midpoint of the flag, at a distance of 5/48th of the flag&#x27;s height above the center of the disk. All other dimensions of the flag are proportional to those of the flag of Aruba. This design was adopted by Order in Council on 29 October 1985, and became effective on 1 January 1986.

== Proposed flags ==
The island of Aruba was once part of the Netherlands Antilles and used the former Netherlands territorial flag. In January 1976, committee was formed to choose a flag specifically for Aruba. Out of 693 design entries, 157 were considered, and eventually, three proposals were selected. Since one of the chosen designs was challenging to manufacture, Smith made a new proposal (after his previous flag was rejected). A committee worked on the winning proposal and ultimately created the flag that was adopted.
