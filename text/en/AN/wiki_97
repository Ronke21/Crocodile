<text>The American Kennel Club (AKC) is a registry of purebred dog pedigrees in the United States. In addition to maintaining its pedigree registry, this kennel club also promotes and sanctions events for purebred dogs, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, an annual event which predates the official forming of the AKC, the National Dog Show and the AKC National Championship. The AKC is a non-member partner with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The AKC recognizes 200 dog breeds, 

==History==
In the early 1800s, the English became concerned with the beauty of dogs as well as their function. This fad spread to North America, and in 1877, the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show began. Soon after, the need for a regulating body became obvious. The National American Kennel Club, which had been founded in 1876, began to publish and make publicly available its studbook in 1879. This organization, however, had more vested interest in field trials than in conformation shows, and eventually changed its name to the National Field Trial Association and stopped hosting conformation shows completely.

In 1884, a group of 13 breed clubs, 10 American clubs and three Canadian clubs founded the American Kennel Club. These 13 clubs pledged &quot;to do everything to advance the study, breeding, exhibiting, running and maintenance of purity of thoroughbred dogs.&quot; The AKC differed from The Kennel Club in that individuals could not directly join the AKC; they became members of smaller, individual breed clubs, which were themselves members of the AKC. When arguments began to develop between the American and Canadian breed clubs in 1886, the Canadian clubs pulled out from the organization and established their own kennel club two years later, the Canadian Kennel Club.

In 1894, the American Kennel Club began to refuse to allow Canadian dogs without an American pedigree to participate in its shows, following the prevailing trends in American purebred cattle organizations. In 1906, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ruled that any dogs imported to America who were not registered with the AKC would have to pay a duty charge; this was later changed in 1911, allowing any dog registered with a kennel club in its home country duty-free entry into the country. Soon after the AKC, CKC, and KC produced agreements that made any dog eligible to be registered with the club in its home country, eligible for registration in the remaining two clubs as well. In 1909, the group moved to New York and became incorporated.

On July 1, 2012, the AKC began to recognize certain titles issued by the North American Flyball Association. These titles are Flyball Champion (FDCh), Flyball Master (FM), and the ONYX title.

==Registration==

The AKC is the largest registry of purebred dogs in the U.S. and is the only not-for profit registry, as well as the most well-known and the most influential. For a purebred dog to be registered with the AKC, the dog&#x27;s parents must be registered with the AKC as the same breed, and the litter in which the dog is born must be registered with the AKC. If the dog&#x27;s parents are not registered with the AKC or the litter is not registered, an exception may be made if the AKC determines, through special registry research, that the dog is eligible for AKC registration. Once a determination of eligibility is met, either by litter application or registry research, the dog can be registered as purebred by the AKC. Registration indicates only that the dog&#x27;s parents were registered as one recognized breed; it does not necessarily indicate that the dog comes from healthy or show-quality bloodlines, nor is registration necessarily a reflection on the quality of the breeder or how the puppy was raised.

===Foundation Stock Service===
The AKC&#x27;s Foundation Stock Service is an optional breed registry service the club provides for new purebred dog breeds that have been introduced to the US and are yet to be recognized by the AKC.

==Activities==
===Competition===
The AKC sanctions events in which dogs and handlers can compete.
;Conformation shows
In AKC conformation shows dogs compete in different classes based on breed and sex, with breeds divided into hound, terrier, working, herding, sporting, non-sporting, toy and miscellaneous groups. The AKC&#x27;s premier conformation shows are the Westminster Dog Show and the AKC National Championship.

;Dog agility
The AKC organises dog agility competitions open to all AKC registered dogs over 12-months age.

;Obedience trials
The AKC organises obedience trials open to all AKC registered dogs over 6-months age.

;Performance dog sports
The AKC organises a variety of field competitions they term performance dog sports, including herding and farm dog trials, scent work trials, earthdog trials, lure coursing trials and field trials for Bassets, Beagles, coonhounds, Dachshunds, pointing dogs, retrievers and spaniels.

===Other programs===

The AKC also offers the Canine Good Citizen program. This program tests dogs of any breed (including mixed breed) or type, registered or not, for basic behavior and temperament suitable for appearing in public and living at home.

Another AKC affiliate is AKC Reunite, formerly AKC Companion Animal Recovery (AKC CAR), founded in 1995, which is North America&#x27;s largest not-for-profit pet ID and recovery service.

Another AKC affiliate is the AKC Humane Fund, which supports breed rescue activities, assists shelters that permit domestic violence victims to bring their pets and educates dog lovers about responsible dog ownership.

The AKC also provides titles for therapy dogs, after the dogs have been certified by AKC recognized therapy dog organizations and have performed a required number of visits.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Genetics===
The AKC has been criticized for the prevalence of genetic disorders in their dogs. As many as 25% of purebred dogs registered by the AKC has at least one hereditary genetic problem. These problems cost breeders and owners almost $1 billion in vet bills and lost revenues from stillborn pups. Some breed clubs, such as the U.S. Border Collie Club, resisted applying for AKC breed acceptance due to fears that doing so would be detrimental to the genetics of the breed they represent.

These genetic issues have resulted in the emergence of &quot;puppy lemon laws&quot; in several U.S. states. These laws protect dog owners from genetic diseases that their breeder may have neglected to inform them of, allowing them to get a refund for the cost of the puppy or to force the breeder to pay their vet bills.

===Health===
The AKC supports some canine health research and has run advertising campaigns implying that the AKC is committed to healthy dogs, but the AKC&#x27;s role in furthering dog health is controversial. Temple Grandin maintains that the AKC&#x27;s standards only regulate physical appearance, not emotional or behavioral health. The AKC itself states that &quot;There is a widely held belief that &#x27;AKC&#x27; or &#x27;AKC papers&#x27; guarantee the quality of a dog. This is not the case. AKC is a registry body. A registration certificate ... in no way indicates the quality or state of health of the dog.&quot;

The AKC has no health standards for breeding; the only breeding restriction is age (a dog can be no younger than eight months). Though the majority of the 170 breed-specific parent clubs have a health committee devoted to their breed&#x27;s specific concerns, the AKC prohibits clubs from imposing stricter regulations since the AKC Rules Applying to Registration and Discipline apply to all breed clubs and do not provide an option for breed clubs to extend or override them. Thus, an AKC breed club cannot require a higher breeding age, hip dysplasia ratings, genetic tests for heritable diseases, or any other restrictions. Parent clubs have the power to define the looks of the breed, or the breed standard, and may also restrict participation in non-regular events or classes such as futurities or maturities to only those dogs meeting their defined criteria. These non-regular events can require health testing, DNA sampling, instinct/ability testing, and other outlined requirements as established by the hosting club.

In summary, attention to health among breeders is voluntary and not mandated. By contrast, many dog clubs outside the U.S. do require health tests of breeding dogs. The German Shepherd Club of Germany, for example, requires hip and elbow X-rays in addition to other tests before a dog can be bred. Such breeding restrictions are not allowed in AKC member clubs. As a result, some U.S. breeders have established parallel registries or health databases outside of the AKC; for example, the Berner Garde established such a database in 1995 after genetic diseases reduced the average lifespan of a Bernese Mountain Dog to seven years. By comparison, the Swiss Bernese Mountain Dog Club introduced mandatory hip X-rays in 1971.

For these, and other reasons, a small number of breed clubs have not yet joined the AKC so they can maintain stringent health standards, but, in general, the breeders&#x27; desire to show their dogs at AKC shows such as the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show has won out over these concerns. Concern surrounding the AKC&#x27;s connections to low-quality breeders has resulted in some dog owners seeking to distance themselves from the organization. In October 2012, Hailey Parker, a longtime Coton de Tulear breeder, filed a lawsuit (that was settled) against the AKC and cited the AKC&#x27;s connections with high-volume breeders among the reasons. The Coton&#x27;s &quot;reputation and business model is based on a disassociation from &#x27;puppy mills&#x27; and similar commercial breeding operations&quot;, according to the complaint.

The club has also been criticized for courting large scale commercial breeders and for lax enforcement of breeding regulations. The AKC employs just nine field inspectors and critics argue that its inspections are ineffective. For example, the owner of a Montana Alaskan Malamute kennel approved by AKC inspectors in 2008 and 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison for animal cruelty in operating that kennel. Similarly, an AKC inspector found a North Carolina kennel &quot;in compliance with AKC&#x27;s Care Conditions Policy&quot; three months before county officers raided the facility and found the dogs in &quot;poor&quot; condition, suffering from illnesses, injuries and living in &quot;unhealthy conditions&quot;, according to court documents. A veterinarian told the court that the rescued dogs had ailments that ranged &quot;from serious to severe&quot; and that &quot;most of the injuries appeared to be chronic, having been in existence for a substantial period of time.&quot;

Similarly, the Humane Society of the United States criticized the AKC for not taking a stand against puppy mills. According to the Humane Society&#x27;s report, &quot;over the past five years, AKC has opposed more than 80 different state bills and local ordinances designed to provide stronger protections for dogs in puppy mills&quot;.

The AKC does support several health research initiatives. The AKC Canine Health Foundation funded research that led to the mapping of the canine genome (DNA sequence) with grants totaling more than $2,000,000. Sequencing of the dog genome began in June 2003, funded in large part by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and finished the completed sequence of the entire dog genome at MIT&#x27;s Broad Institute in 2005. Because people inherit many of the same diseases as dogs, humans can also benefit from health research funded for dogs.

The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and the AKC Canine Health Foundation have established the Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) to encourage health testing by breeders and provide breeders and researchers with information to improve breeding programs. More than 135 different breeds have specific health testing prerequisites required by their parent breed club.

===Opposition by breed clubs===

*Cavalier King Charles Spaniel: The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club voted to reject AKC recognition in May 2000 due to the incompatibility of the breed club&#x27;s no-sales-to-pet-stores rule, while the AKC required such sales. The breed club had such a rule to aid in the genetic health of the breed.
*Jack Russell Terrier: In the 1990s, some breeders of Jack Russell Terriers wanted to be included in the AKC, but the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA) opposed the idea on the grounds that the working abilities of the JRT would be compromised by turning it into a show dog with an association dedicated to providing awards and championship status to individual dogs based solely on their conformation. The AKC did accept the JRT into the registry but under the new name Parson Russell Terrier to distinguish the AKC dogs from the JRT working dogs.

===Lobbying===
The AKC has lobbied dog-related bills. They are opposed to tightening of laws regarding licensing of trainers.

<doc id="84632" wikidata="Q956129" url="?curid=84632" title="Information Age">
<text>The Information Age is a historical period that began in the mid-20th century. It is characterized by a rapid shift from traditional industries, as established during the Industrial Revolution, to an economy centered on information technology. The onset of the Information Age has been linked to the development of the transistor in 1947, and the optical amplifier in 1957. These technological advances have had a significant impact on the way information is processed and transmitted.

According to the United Nations Public Administration Network, the Information Age was formed by capitalizing on computer miniaturization advances, which led to modernized information systems and internet communications as the driving force of social evolution.

There is ongoing debate concerning whether the Third Industrial Revolution has already ended, and if the Fourth Industrial Revolution has already begun due to the recent breakthroughs in areas such as artificial intelligence and biotechnology. This next transition has been theorized to harken the advent of the Imagination Age, the Internet of things (IoT), and rapid advancements in machine learning.

== History ==
The digital revolution converted technology from analog format to digital format. By doing this, it became possible to make copies that were identical to the original. In digital communications, for example, repeating hardware was able to amplify the digital signal and pass it on with no loss of information in the signal. Of equal importance to the revolution was the ability to easily move the digital information between media, and to access or distribute it remotely. One turning point of the revolution was the change from analog to digitally recorded music. During the 1980s the digital format of optical compact discs gradually replaced analog formats, such as vinyl records and cassette tapes, as the popular medium of choice.

===Previous inventions===

Humans have manufactured tools for counting and calculating since ancient times, such as the abacus, astrolabe, equatorium, and mechanical timekeeping devices. More complicated devices started appearing in the 1600s, including the slide rule and mechanical calculators. By the early 1800s, the Industrial Revolution had produced mass-market calculators like the arithmometer and the enabling technology of the punch card. Charles Babbage proposed a mechanical general-purpose computer called the Analytical Engine, but it was never successfully built, and was largely forgotten by the 20th century and unknown to most of the inventors of modern computers.

The Second Industrial Revolution in the last quarter of the 19th century developed useful electrical circuits and the telegraph. In the 1880s, Herman Hollerith developed electromechanical tabulating and calculating devices using punch cards and unit record equipment, which became widespread in business and government.

Meanwhile, various analog computer systems used electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic systems to model problems and calculate answers. These included an 1872 tide-predicting machine, differential analysers, perpetual calendar machines, the Deltar for water management in the Netherlands, network analyzers for electrical systems, and various machines for aiming military guns and bombs. The construction of problem-specific analog computers continued in the late 1940s and beyond, with FERMIAC for neutron transport, Project Cyclone for various military applications, and the Phillips Machine for economic modeling.

Building on the complexity of the Z1 and Z2, German inventor Konrad Zuse used electromechanical systems to complete in 1941 the Z3, the world&#x27;s first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer. Also during World War II, Allied engineers constructed electromechanical bombes to break German Enigma machine encoding. The base-10 electromechanical Harvard Mark I was completed in 1944, and was to some degree improved with inspiration from Charles Babbage&#x27;s designs.

===1947–1969: Origins===
In 1947, the first working transistor, the germanium-based point-contact transistor, was invented by John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs. This led the way to more advanced digital computers. From the late 1940s, universities, military, and businesses developed computer systems to digitally replicate and automate previously manually performed mathematical calculations, with the LEO being the first commercially available general-purpose computer.

Digital communication became economical for widespread adoption after the invention of the personal computer in the 1970s. Claude Shannon, a Bell Labs mathematician, is credited for having laid out the foundations of digitalization in his pioneering 1948 article, &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;.

In 1948, Bardeen and Brattain patented an insulated-gate transistor (IGFET) with an inversion layer. Their concept, forms the basis of CMOS and DRAM technology today. In 1957 at Bell Labs, Frosch and Derick were able to manufacture planar silicon dioxide transistors, later a team at Bell Labs demonstrated a working MOSFET. The first integrated circuit milestone was achieved by Jack Kilby in 1958.

Other important technological developments included the invention of the monolithic integrated circuit chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959, made possible by the planar process developed by Jean Hoerni. In 1963, complementary MOS (CMOS) was developed by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor. The self-aligned gate transistor, which further facilitated mass production, was invented in 1966 by Robert Bower at Hughes Aircraft and independently by Robert Kerwin, Donald Klein and John Sarace at Bell Labs.

In 1962 AT&amp;T deployed the T-carrier for long-haul pulse-code modulation (PCM) digital voice transmission. The T1 format carried 24 pulse-code modulated, time-division multiplexed speech signals each encoded in 64 kbit/s streams, leaving 8 kbit/s of framing information which facilitated the synchronization and demultiplexing at the receiver. Over the subsequent decades the digitisation of voice became the norm for all but the last mile (where analogue continued to be the norm right into the late 1990s).

Following the development of MOS integrated circuit chips in the early 1960s, MOS chips reached higher transistor density and lower manufacturing costs than bipolar integrated circuits by 1964. MOS chips further increased in complexity at a rate predicted by Moore&#x27;s law, leading to large-scale integration (LSI) with hundreds of transistors on a single MOS chip by the late 1960s. The application of MOS LSI chips to computing was the basis for the first microprocessors, as engineers began recognizing that a complete computer processor could be contained on a single MOS LSI chip. In 1968, Fairchild engineer Federico Faggin improved MOS technology with his development of the silicon-gate MOS chip, which he later used to develop the Intel 4004, the first single-chip microprocessor. It was released by Intel in 1971, and laid the foundations for the microcomputer revolution that began in the 1970s.

MOS technology also led to the development of semiconductor image sensors suitable for digital cameras. The first such image sensor was the charge-coupled device, developed by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969, based on MOS capacitor technology.

===1969–1989: Invention of the internet, rise of home computers===

The public was first introduced to the concepts that led to the Internet when a message was sent over the ARPANET in 1969. Packet switched networks such as ARPANET, Mark I, CYCLADES, Merit Network, Tymnet, and Telenet, were developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s using a variety of protocols. The ARPANET in particular led to the development of protocols for internetworking, in which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks.

The Whole Earth movement of the 1960s advocated the use of new technology.

In the 1970s, the home computer was introduced, time-sharing computers, the video game console, the first coin-op video games, and the golden age of arcade video games began with Space Invaders. As digital technology proliferated, and the switch from analog to digital record keeping became the new standard in business, a relatively new job description was popularized, the data entry clerk. Culled from the ranks of secretaries and typists from earlier decades, the data entry clerk&#x27;s job was to convert analog data (customer records, invoices, etc.) into digital data.

In developed nations, computers achieved semi-ubiquity during the 1980s as they made their way into schools, homes, business, and industry. Automated teller machines, industrial robots, CGI in film and television, electronic music, bulletin board systems, and video games all fueled what became the zeitgeist of the 1980s. Millions of people purchased home computers, making household names of early personal computer manufacturers such as Apple, Commodore, and Tandy. To this day the Commodore 64 is often cited as the best selling computer of all time, having sold 17 million units (by some accounts) between 1982 and 1994.

In 1984, the U.S. Census Bureau began collecting data on computer and Internet use in the United States; their first survey showed that 8.2% of all U.S. households owned a personal computer in 1984, and that households with children under the age of 18 were nearly twice as likely to own one at 15.3% (middle and upper middle class households were the most likely to own one, at 22.9%). By 1989, 15% of all U.S. households owned a computer, and nearly 30% of households with children under the age of 18 owned one. By the late 1980s, many businesses were dependent on computers and digital technology.

Motorola created the first mobile phone, Motorola DynaTac, in 1983. However, this device used analog communication - digital cell phones were not sold commercially until 1991 when the 2G network started to be opened in Finland to accommodate the unexpected demand for cell phones that was becoming apparent in the late 1980s.

&quot;Compute!&quot; magazine predicted that CD-ROM would be the centerpiece of the revolution, with multiple household devices reading the discs.

The first true digital camera was created in 1988, and the first were marketed in December 1989 in Japan and in 1990 in the United States. By the early 2000s, digital cameras had eclipsed traditional film in popularity.

Digital ink and paint was also invented in the late 1980s. Disney&#x27;s CAPS system (created 1988) was used for a scene in 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and for all their animation films between 1990&#x27;s &quot;The Rescuers Down Under&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Home on the Range&quot;.
===1989–2005: Invention of the World Wide Web, mainstreaming of the Internet, Web 1.0===

Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. The “Web 1.0 era” ended in 2005, coinciding with the development of further advanced technologies during the start of the 21st century.

The first public digital HDTV broadcast was of the 1990 World Cup that June; it was played in 10 theaters in Spain and Italy. However, HDTV did not become a standard until the mid-2000s outside Japan.

The World Wide Web became publicly accessible in 1991, which had been available only to government and universities. In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina introduced Mosaic, the first web browser capable of displaying inline images and the basis for later browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. Stanford Federal Credit Union was the first financial institution to offer online internet banking services to all of its members in October 1994. In 1996 OP Financial Group, also a cooperative bank, became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe. The Internet expanded quickly, and by 1996, it was part of mass culture and many businesses listed websites in their ads. By 1999, almost every country had a connection, and nearly half of Americans and people in several other countries used the Internet on a regular basis. However throughout the 1990s, &quot;getting online&quot; entailed complicated configuration, and dial-up was the only connection type affordable by individual users; the present day mass Internet culture was not possible.

In 1989, about 15% of all households in the United States owned a personal computer.
For households with children, nearly 30% owned a computer in 1989, and in 2000, 65% owned one.

Cell phones became as ubiquitous as computers by the early 2000s, with movie theaters beginning to show ads telling people to silence their phones. They also became much more advanced than phones of the 1990s, most of which only took calls or at most allowed for the playing of simple games.

Text messaging became widely used in the late 1990s worldwide, except for in the United States of America where text messaging didn&#x27;t become commonplace till the early 2000s.

The digital revolution became truly global in this time as well - after revolutionizing society in the developed world in the 1990s, the digital revolution spread to the masses in the developing world in the 2000s.

By 2000, a majority of U.S. households had at least one personal computer and internet access the following year. In 2002, a majority of U.S. survey respondents reported having a mobile phone.

===2005–2020: Web 2.0, social media, smartphones, digital TV===
In late 2005 the population of the Internet reached 1 billion, and 3 billion people worldwide used cell phones by the end of the decade. HDTV became the standard television broadcasting format in many countries by the end of the decade. In September and December 2006 respectively, Luxembourg and the Netherlands became the first countries to completely transition from analog to digital television. In September 2007, a majority of U.S. survey respondents reported having broadband internet at home. According to estimates from the Nielsen Media Research, approximately 45.7 million U.S. households in 2006 (or approximately 40 percent of approximately 114.4 million) owned a dedicated home video game console, and by 2015, 51 percent of U.S. households owned a dedicated home video game console according to an Entertainment Software Association annual industry report. By 2012, over 2 billion people used the Internet, twice the number using it in 2007. Cloud computing had entered the mainstream by the early 2010s. In January 2013, a majority of U.S. survey respondents reported owning a smartphone. By 2016, half of the world&#x27;s population was connected and as of 2020, that number has risen to 67%.

== Rise in digital technology use of computers ==
In the late 1980s, less than 1% of the world&#x27;s technologically stored information was in digital format, while it was 94% in 2007, with more than 99% by 2014.

It is estimated that the world&#x27;s capacity to store information has increased from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986, to some 5,000 exabytes in 2014 (5 zettabytes).

==Overview of early developments==
===Library expansion and Moore&#x27;s law===
Library expansion was calculated in 1945 by Fremont Rider to double in capacity every 16 years where sufficient space made available. He advocated replacing bulky, decaying printed works with miniaturized microform analog photographs, which could be duplicated on-demand for library patrons and other institutions.

Rider did not foresee, however, the digital technology that would follow decades later to replace analog microform with digital imaging, storage, and transmission media, whereby vast increases in the rapidity of information growth would be made possible through automated, potentially-lossless digital technologies. Accordingly, Moore&#x27;s law, formulated around 1965, would calculate that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years.

By the early 1980s, along with improvements in computing power, the proliferation of the smaller and less expensive personal computers allowed for immediate access to information and the ability to share and store it. Connectivity between computers within organizations enabled access to greater amounts of information.

===Information storage and Kryder&#x27;s law===
 
The world&#x27;s technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes (EB) in 1986 to 15.8 EB in 1993; over 54.5 EB in 2000; and to 295 (optimally compressed) EB in 2007. This is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-megabyte (MB) CD-ROM per person in 1986 (539 MB per person); roughly four CD-ROM per person in 1993; twelve CD-ROM per person in the year 2000; and almost sixty-one CD-ROM per person in 2007. It is estimated that the world&#x27;s capacity to store information has reached 5 zettabytes in 2014, the informational equivalent of 4,500 stacks of printed books from the earth to the sun.

The amount of digital data stored appears to be growing approximately exponentially, reminiscent of Moore&#x27;s law. As such, Kryder&#x27;s law prescribes that the amount of storage space available appears to be growing approximately exponentially.

===Information transmission===
The world&#x27;s technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986; 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993; 1.2 (optimally compressed) zettabytes in 2000; and 1.9 zettabytes in 2007, the information equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day.

The world&#x27;s effective capacity to exchange information through two-way Telecommunications networks was 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986; 471 petabytes in 1993; 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000; and 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007, the information equivalent of six newspapers per person per day. In the 1990s, the spread of the Internet caused a sudden leap in access to and ability to share information in businesses and homes globally. A computer that cost $3000 in 1997 would cost $2000 two years later and $1000 the following year, due to the rapid advancement of technology.

===Computation===
The world&#x27;s technological capacity to compute information with human-guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 108 MIPS in 1986, to 4.4 × 109 MIPS in 1993; to 2.9 × 1011 MIPS in 2000; to 6.4 × 1012 MIPS in 2007. An article featured in the journal &quot;Trends in Ecology and Evolution&quot; in 2016 reported that:

===Genetic information===
Genetic code may also be considered part of the information revolution. Now that sequencing has been computerized, genome can be rendered and manipulated as data. This started with DNA sequencing, invented by Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam in 1976-1977 and Frederick Sanger in 1977, grew steadily with the Human Genome Project, initially conceived by Gilbert and finally, the practical applications of sequencing, such as gene testing, after the discovery by Myriad Genetics of the BRCA1 breast cancer gene mutation. Sequence data in Genbank has grown from the 606 genome sequences registered in December 1982 to the 231 million genomes in August 2021. An additional 13 trillion incomplete sequences are registered in the Whole Genome Shotgun submission database as of August 2021. The information contained in these registered sequences has doubled every 18 months.

==Different stage conceptualizations==

During rare times in human history, there have been periods of innovation that have transformed human life. The Neolithic Age, the Scientific Age and the Industrial Age all, ultimately, induced discontinuous and irreversible changes in the economic, social and cultural elements of the daily life of most people. Traditionally, these epochs have taken place over hundreds, or in the case of the Neolithic Revolution, thousands of years, whereas the Information Age swept to all parts of the globe in just a few years, as a result of the rapidly advancing speed of information exchange.

Between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic period, humans began to domesticate animals, began to farm grains and to replace stone tools with ones made of metal. These innovations allowed nomadic hunter-gatherers to settle down. Villages formed along the Yangtze River in China in 6,500 B.C., the Nile River region of Africa and in Mesopotamia (Iraq) in 6,000 B.C. Cities emerged between 6,000 B.C. and 3,500 B.C. The development of written communication (cuneiform in Sumeria and hieroglyphs in Egypt in 3,500 B.C. and writing in Egypt in 2,560 B.C. and in Minoa and China around 1,450 B.C.) enabled ideas to be preserved for extended periods to spread extensively. In all, Neolithic developments, augmented by writing as an information tool, laid the groundwork for the advent of civilization.

The Scientific Age began in the period between Galileo&#x27;s 1543 proof that the planets orbit the Sun and Newton&#x27;s publication of the laws of motion and gravity in &quot;Principia&quot; in 1697. This age of discovery continued through the 18th century, accelerated by widespread use of the moveable type printing press by Johannes Gutenberg.

The Industrial Age began in Great Britain in 1760 and continued into the mid-19th century. The invention of machines such as the mechanical textile weaver by Edmund Cartwrite, the rotating shaft steam engine by James Watt and the cotton gin by Eli Whitney, along with processes for mass manufacturing, came to serve the needs of a growing global population. The Industrial Age harnessed steam and waterpower to reduce the dependence on animal and human physical labor as the primary means of production. Thus, the core of the Industrial Revolution was the generation and distribution of energy from coal and water to produce steam and, later in the 20th century, electricity.

The Information Age also requires electricity to power the global networks of computers that process and store data. However, what dramatically accelerated the pace of The Information Age’s adoption, as compared to previous ones, was the speed by which knowledge could be transferred and pervaded the entire human family in a few short decades. This acceleration came about with the adoptions of a new form of power. Beginning in 1972, engineers devised ways to harness light to convey data through fiber optic cable. Today, light-based optical networking systems at the heart of telecom networks and the Internet span the globe and carry most of the information traffic to and from users and data storage systems.

There are different conceptualizations of the Information Age. Some focus on the evolution of information over the ages, distinguishing between the Primary Information Age and the Secondary Information Age. Information in the Primary Information Age was handled by newspapers, radio and television. The Secondary Information Age was developed by the Internet, satellite televisions and mobile phones. The Tertiary Information Age was emerged by media of the Primary Information Age interconnected with media of the Secondary Information Age as presently experienced.
Others classify it in terms of the well-established Schumpeterian long waves or Kondratiev waves. Here authors distinguish three different long-term metaparadigms, each with different long waves. The first focused on the transformation of material, including stone, bronze, and iron. The second, often referred to as Industrial Revolution, was dedicated to the transformation of energy, including water, steam, electric, and combustion power. Finally, the most recent metaparadigm aims at transforming information. It started out with the proliferation of communication and stored data and has now entered the age of algorithms, which aims at creating automated processes to convert the existing information into actionable knowledge.

==Information in social and economic activities==

The main feature of the information revolution is the growing economic, social and technological role of information. Information-related activities did not come up with the Information Revolution. They existed, in one form or the other, in all human societies, and eventually developed into institutions, such as the Platonic Academy, Aristotle&#x27;s Peripatetic school in the Lyceum, the Musaeum and the Library of Alexandria, or the schools of Babylonian astronomy. The Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revolution came up when new informational inputs were produced by individual innovators, or by scientific and technical institutions. During the Information Revolution all these activities are experiencing continuous growth, while other information-oriented activities are emerging.

Information is the central theme of several new sciences, which emerged in the 1940s, including Shannon&#x27;s (1949) &quot;Information Theory&quot; and Wiener&#x27;s (1948) &quot;Cybernetics&quot;. Wiener stated: &quot;information is information not matter or energy&quot;. This aphorism suggests that information should be considered along with matter and energy as the third constituent part of the Universe; information is carried by matter or by energy. By the 1990s some writers believed that changes implied by the Information revolution will lead to not only a fiscal crisis for governments but also the disintegration of all &quot;large structures&quot;.

==The theory of information revolution==
The term &quot;information revolution&quot; may relate to, or contrast with, such widely used terms as Industrial Revolution and Agricultural Revolution. Note, however, that you may prefer mentalist to materialist paradigm. The following fundamental aspects of the theory of information revolution can be given:

# The object of economic activities can be conceptualized according to the fundamental distinction between matter, energy, and information. These apply both to the object of each economic activity, as well as within each economic activity or enterprise. For instance, an industry may process matter (e.g. iron) using energy and information (production and process technologies, management, etc.).
# Information is a factor of production (along with capital, labor, land (economics)), as well as a product sold in the market, that is, a commodity. As such, it acquires use value and exchange value, and therefore a price.
# All products have use value, exchange value, and informational value. The latter can be measured by the information content of the product, in terms of innovation, design, etc.
# Industries develop information-generating activities, the so-called Research and Development (R&amp;D) functions.
# Enterprises, and society at large, develop the information control and processing functions, in the form of management structures; these are also called &quot;white-collar workers&quot;, &quot;bureaucracy&quot;, &quot;managerial functions&quot;, etc.
# Labor can be classified according to the object of labor, into information labor and non-information labor.
# Information activities constitute a large, new economic sector, the information sector along with the traditional primary sector, secondary sector, and tertiary sector, according to the three-sector hypothesis. These should be restated because they are based on the ambiguous definitions made by Colin Clark (1940), who included in the tertiary sector all activities that have not been included in the primary (agriculture, forestry, etc.) and secondary (manufacturing) sectors. The quaternary sector and the quinary sector of the economy attempt to classify these new activities, but their definitions are not based on a clear conceptual scheme, although the latter is considered by some as equivalent with the information sector.
# From a strategic point of view, sectors can be defined as information sector, means of production, means of consumption, thus extending the classical Ricardo-Marx model of the Capitalist mode of production (see Influences on Karl Marx). Marx stressed in many occasions the role of the &quot;intellectual element&quot; in production, but failed to find a place for it into his model.
# Innovations are the result of the production of new information, as new products, new methods of production, patents, etc. Diffusion of innovations manifests saturation effects (related term: market saturation), following certain cyclical patterns and creating &quot;economic waves&quot;, also referred to as &quot;business cycles&quot;. There are various types of waves, such as Kondratiev wave (54 years), Kuznets swing (18 years), Juglar cycle (9 years) and Kitchin (about 4 years, see also Joseph Schumpeter) distinguished by their nature, duration, and, thus, economic impact.
# Diffusion of innovations causes structural-sectoral shifts in the economy, which can be smooth or can create crisis and renewal, a process which Joseph Schumpeter called vividly &quot;creative destruction&quot;.

From a different perspective, Irving E. Fang (1997) identified six &#x27;Information Revolutions&#x27;: writing, printing, mass media, entertainment, the &#x27;tool shed&#x27; (which we call &#x27;home&#x27; now), and the information highway. In this work the term &#x27;information revolution&#x27; is used in a narrow sense, to describe trends in communication media.

==Measuring and modeling the information revolution==
Porat (1976) measured the information sector in the US using the input-output analysis; OECD has included statistics on the information sector in the economic reports of its member countries. Veneris (1984, 1990) explored the theoretical, economic and regional aspects of the informational revolution and developed a systems dynamics simulation computer model.

These works can be seen as following the path originated with the work of Fritz Machlup who in his (1962) book &quot;The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States&quot;, claimed that the &quot;knowledge industry represented 29% of the US gross national product&quot;, which he saw as evidence that the Information Age had begun. He defines knowledge as a commodity and attempts to measure the magnitude of the production and distribution of this commodity within a modern economy. Machlup divided information use into three classes: instrumental, intellectual, and pastime knowledge. He identified also five types of knowledge: practical knowledge; intellectual knowledge, that is, general culture and the satisfying of intellectual curiosity; pastime knowledge, that is, knowledge satisfying non-intellectual curiosity or the desire for light entertainment and emotional stimulation; spiritual or religious knowledge; unwanted knowledge, accidentally acquired and aimlessly retained.

More recent estimates have reached the following results:
* the world&#x27;s technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 7% between 1986 and 2007;
* the world&#x27;s technological capacity to store information grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 25% between 1986 and 2007;
* the world&#x27;s effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunications networks grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 30% during the same two decades;
* the world&#x27;s technological capacity to compute information with the help of humanly guided general-purpose computers grew at a sustained compound annual growth rate of 61% during the same period.

==Economics==
Eventually, Information and communication technology (ICT)—i.e. computers, computerized machinery, fiber optics, communication satellites, the Internet, and other ICT tools—became a significant part of the world economy, as the development of optical networking and microcomputers greatly changed many businesses and industries. Nicholas Negroponte captured the essence of these changes in his 1995 book, &quot;Being Digital,&quot; in which he discusses the similarities and differences between products made of atoms and products made of bits.

===Jobs and income distribution===
The Information Age has affected the workforce in several ways, such as compelling workers to compete in a global job market. One of the most evident concerns is the replacement of human labor by computers that can do their jobs faster and more effectively, thus creating a situation in which individuals who perform tasks that can easily be automated are forced to find employment where their labor is not as disposable. This especially creates issue for those in industrial cities, where solutions typically involve lowering working time, which is often highly resisted. Thus, individuals who lose their jobs may be pressed to move up into more indispensable professions (e.g. engineers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, professors, scientists, executives, journalists, consultants), who are able to compete successfully in the world market and receive (relatively) high wages.

Along with automation, jobs traditionally associated with the middle class (e.g. assembly line, data processing, management, and supervision) have also begun to disappear as result of outsourcing. Unable to compete with those in developing countries, production and service workers in post-industrial (i.e. developed) societies either lose their jobs through outsourcing, accept wage cuts, or settle for low-skill, low-wage service jobs. In the past, the economic fate of individuals would be tied to that of their nation&#x27;s. For example, workers in the United States were once well paid in comparison to those in other countries. With the advent of the Information Age and improvements in communication, this is no longer the case, as workers must now compete in a global job market, whereby wages are less dependent on the success or failure of individual economies.

In effectuating a globalized workforce, the internet has just as well allowed for increased opportunity in developing countries, making it possible for workers in such places to provide in-person services, therefore competing directly with their counterparts in other nations. This competitive advantage translates into increased opportunities and higher wages.

===Automation, productivity, and job gain===
The Information Age has affected the workforce in that automation and computerization have resulted in higher productivity coupled with net job loss in manufacturing. In the United States, for example, from January 1972 to August 2010, the number of people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from 17,500,000 to 11,500,000 while manufacturing value rose 270%. Although it initially appeared that job loss in the industrial sector might be partially offset by the rapid growth of jobs in information technology, the recession of March 2001 foreshadowed a sharp drop in the number of jobs in the sector. This pattern of decrease in jobs would continue until 2003, and data has shown that, overall, technology creates more jobs than it destroys even in the short run.

===Information-intensive industry===

Industry has become more information-intensive while less labor- and capital-intensive. This has left important implications for the workforce, as workers have become increasingly productive as the value of their labor decreases. For the system of capitalism itself, the value of labor decreases, the value of capital increases.

In the classical model, investments in human and financial capital are important predictors of the performance of a new venture. However, as demonstrated by Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, it now seems possible for a group of relatively inexperienced people with limited capital to succeed on a large scale.

==Innovations==

The Information Age was enabled by technology developed in the Digital Revolution, which was itself enabled by building on the developments of the Technological Revolution.

===Transistors===

The onset of the Information Age can be associated with the development of transistor technology. The concept of a field-effect transistor was first theorized by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. The first practical transistor was the point-contact transistor, invented by the engineers Walter Houser Brattain and John Bardeen while working for William Shockley at Bell Labs in 1947. This was a breakthrough that laid the foundations for modern technology. Shockley&#x27;s research team also invented the bipolar junction transistor in 1952. The most widely used type of transistor is the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1960. The complementary MOS (CMOS) fabrication process was developed by Frank Wanlass and Chih-Tang Sah in 1963.

===Computers===

Before the advent of electronics, mechanical computers, like the Analytical Engine in 1837, were designed to provide routine mathematical calculation and simple decision-making capabilities. Military needs during World War II drove development of the first electronic computers, based on vacuum tubes, including the Z3, the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, Colossus computer, and ENIAC.

The invention of the transistor enabled the era of mainframe computers (1950s–1970s), typified by the IBM 360. These large, room-sized computers provided data calculation and manipulation that was much faster than humanly possible, but were expensive to buy and maintain, so were initially limited to a few scientific institutions, large corporations, and government agencies.

The germanium integrated circuit (IC) was invented by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958. The silicon integrated circuit was then invented in 1959 by Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor, using the planar process developed by Jean Hoerni, who was in turn building on Mohamed Atalla&#x27;s silicon surface passivation method developed at Bell Labs in 1957. Following the invention of the MOS transistor by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, the MOS integrated circuit was developed by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962. The silicon-gate MOS IC was later developed by Federico Faggin at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968. With the advent of the MOS transistor and the MOS IC, transistor technology rapidly improved, and the ratio of computing power to size increased dramatically, giving direct access to computers to ever smaller groups of people.

The first commercial single-chip microprocessor launched in 1971, the Intel 4004, which was developed by Federico Faggin using his silicon-gate MOS IC technology, along with Marcian Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stan Mazor.

Along with electronic arcade machines and home video game consoles pioneered by Nolan Bushnell in the 1970s, the development of personal computers like the Commodore PET and Apple II (both in 1977) gave individuals access to the computer. However, data sharing between individual computers was either non-existent or largely manual, at first using punched cards and magnetic tape, and later floppy disks.

===Data===
The first developments for storing data were initially based on photographs, starting with microphotography in 1851 and then microform in the 1920s, with the ability to store documents on film, making them much more compact. Early information theory and Hamming codes were developed about 1950, but awaited technical innovations in data transmission and storage to be put to full use.

Magnetic-core memory was developed from the research of Frederick W. Viehe in 1947 and An Wang at Harvard University in 1949. With the advent of the MOS transistor, MOS semiconductor memory was developed by John Schmidt at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1964. In 1967, Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze at Bell Labs described in 1967 how the floating gate of an MOS semiconductor device could be used for the cell of a reprogrammable ROM. Following the invention of flash memory by Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba in 1980, Toshiba commercialized NAND flash memory in 1987.

Copper wire cables transmitting digital data connected computer terminals and peripherals to mainframes, and special message-sharing systems leading to email, were first developed in the 1960s. Independent computer-to-computer networking began with ARPANET in 1969. This expanded to become the Internet (coined in 1974). Access to the Internet improved with the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991. The capacity expansion from dense wave division multiplexing, optical amplification and optical networking in the mid-1990s led to record data transfer rates. By 2018, optical networks routinely delivered 30.4 terabits/s over a fiber optic pair, the data equivalent of 1.2 million simultaneous 4K HD video streams.

MOSFET scaling, the rapid miniaturization of MOSFETs at a rate predicted by Moore&#x27;s law, led to computers becoming smaller and more powerful, to the point where they could be carried. During the 1980s1990s, laptops were developed as a form of portable computer, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) could be used while standing or walking. Pagers, widely used by the 1980s, were largely replaced by mobile phones beginning in the late 1990s, providing mobile networking features to some computers. Now commonplace, this technology is extended to digital cameras and other wearable devices. Starting in the late 1990s, tablets and then smartphones combined and extended these abilities of computing, mobility, and information sharing. Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) image sensors, which first began appearing in the late 1960s, led to the transition from analog to digital imaging, and from analog to digital cameras, during the 1980s–1990s. The most common image sensors are the charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor and the CMOS (complementary MOS) active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor).

Electronic paper, which has origins in the 1970s, allows digital information to appear as paper documents.

===Personal computers===
By 1976, there were several firms racing to introduce the first truly successful commercial personal computers. Three machines, the Apple II, Commodore PET 2001 and TRS-80 were all released in 1977, becoming the most popular by late 1978. &quot;Byte&quot; magazine later referred to Commodore, Apple, and Tandy as the &quot;1977 Trinity&quot;. Also in 1977, Sord Computer Corporation released the Sord M200 Smart Home Computer in Japan.

==== Apple II ====

Steve Wozniak (known as &quot;Woz&quot;), a regular visitor to Homebrew Computer Club meetings, designed the single-board Apple I computer and first demonstrated it there. With specifications in hand and an order for 100 machines at US$500 each from the Byte Shop, Woz and his friend Steve Jobs founded Apple Computer.

About 200 of the machines sold before the company announced the Apple II as a complete computer. It had color graphics, a full QWERTY keyboard, and internal slots for expansion, which were mounted in a high quality streamlined plastic case. The monitor and I/O devices were sold separately. The original Apple II operating system was only the built-in BASIC interpreter contained in ROM. Apple DOS was added to support the diskette drive; the last version was &quot;Apple DOS 3.3&quot;.

Its higher price and lack of floating point BASIC, along with a lack of retail distribution sites, caused it to lag in sales behind the other Trinity machines until 1979, when it surpassed the PET. It was again pushed into 4th place when Atari, Inc. introduced its Atari 8-bit computers.

Despite slow initial sales, the lifetime of the Apple II was about eight years longer than other machines, and so accumulated the highest total sales. By 1985, 2.1 million had sold and more than 4 million Apple II&#x27;s were shipped by the end of its production in 1993.

=== Optical networking ===
Optical communication plays a crucial role in communication networks. Optical communication provides the transmission backbone for the telecommunications and computer networks that underlie the Internet, the foundation for the Digital Revolution and Information Age.

The two core technologies are the optical fiber and light amplification (the optical amplifier). In 1953, Bram van Heel demonstrated image transmission through bundles of optical fibers with a transparent cladding. The same year, Harold Hopkins and Narinder Singh Kapany at Imperial College succeeded in making image-transmitting bundles with over 10,000 optical fibers, and subsequently achieved image transmission through a 75 cm long bundle which combined several thousand fibers.

Gordon Gould invented the optical amplifier and the laser, and also established the first optical telecommunications company, Optelecom, to design communication systems. The firm was a co-founder in Ciena Corp., the venture that popularized the optical amplifier with the introduction of the first dense wave division multiplexing system. This massive scale communication technology has emerged as the common basis of all telecommunications networks and, thus, a foundation of the Information Age.

==Economy, society, and culture==
Manuel Castells captures the significance of the Information Age in &quot;The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture&quot; when he writes of our global interdependence and the new relationships between economy, state and society, what he calls &quot;a new society-in-the-making.&quot; He cautions that just because humans have dominated the material world, does not mean that the Information Age is the end of history: &quot;It is in fact, quite the opposite: history is just beginning, if by history we understand the moment when, after millennia of a prehistoric battle with Nature, first to survive, then to conquer it, our species has reached the level of knowledge and social organization that will allow us to live in a predominantly social world. It is the beginning of a new existence, and indeed the beginning of a new age, The Information Age, marked by the autonomy of culture vis-à-vis the material basis of our existence.&quot;

Thomas Chatterton Williams wrote about the dangers of anti-intellectualism in the Information Age in a piece for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. Although access to information has never been greater, most information is irrelevant or insubstantial. The Information Age&#x27;s emphasis on speed over expertise contributes to &quot;superficial culture in which even the elite will openly disparage as pointless our main repositories for the very best that has been thought.&quot;

<doc id="84633" wikidata="Q471032" url="?curid=84633" title="Larry Graham">
<text>Larry Graham Jr. (born August 14, 1946) is an American bassist and baritone singer, with the psychedelic soul/funk band Sly and the Family Stone and as the founder and frontman of Graham Central Station. In 1980, he released the single &quot;One in a Million You&quot;, which reached the top ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He is credited with the invention of the slapping technique on the electric bass guitar, which radically expanded the tonal palette of the bass, although he himself refers to the technique as &quot;thumpin&#x27; and pluckin&#x27;&quot;. 

In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Sly and the Family Stone. He is also the uncle of rapper Drake.

==Early life ==
Graham was born August 14, 1946, in Beaumont, Texas, U.S., to parents who were successful musicians.

==Career==
=== Sly and the Family Stone ===
Graham played bass in the funk band Sly and the Family Stone from 1967 to 1972. The band was the first major American rock group to have a racially integrated, mixed-gender lineup. They had a series of influential tracks during the 1960s that entered the Billboard Hot 100 such as &quot;Dance to the Music&quot; (1968), &quot;Everyday People&quot; (1968), and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot; (1969), as well as critically acclaimed albums such as &quot;Stand!&quot; (1969), which combined pop sensibility with social commentary. 

After many years of tension between Graham and frontman Sly Stone, Larry Graham left Sly and the Family Stone in 1972, after a post-concert brawl broke out between Graham and Sly, and rumours also spread that Larry had hired a hit man to kill Sly. Graham and his wife climbed out of a hotel window to escape, and Pat Rizzo gave them a ride to safety. Unable to continue working with Sly, Graham immediately quit. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Sly and the Family Stone. 

=== 1970s ===
After Sly and the Family Stone, Graham formed his own band, Graham Central Station. The name is a pun on Grand Central Station, the train station located in Manhattan, New York City. Graham Central Station had several hits in the 1970s, as well as the album track &quot;Hair&quot;.

In the mid-1970s, Larry Graham worked with Betty Davis, the second ex-wife of jazz musician Miles Davis. Betty Davis&#x27; band included members of the Tower of Power horns and the Pointer Sisters, and she recorded three albums to critical acclaim but limited commercial success.

In 1975, Graham became one of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Eventually, he was credited with introducing Prince to the faith. In the early 1980s, Graham recorded five solo albums and had several solo hits on the R&amp;B chart. His biggest hit was &quot;One in a Million You&quot;, a crossover hit that reached No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1980.

=== 1990s–present ===
He reformed Graham Central Station in the early 1990s and performed with the band for several years during which they released two live albums. One was recorded in Japan in 1992, and the other, recorded in London in 1996, had only 1000 copies printed and was exclusively sold at concerts.

In 1998, he recorded a solo album under the name Graham Central Station &quot;GCS 2000&quot;. It was a collaboration between Larry Graham and Prince. While Graham wrote all the songs, except one co-written by Prince, the album was co-arranged and co-produced by Prince, and most of the instruments and vocals were recorded by both Graham and Prince. Graham also played bass on tours with Prince from 1997 to 2000. He appeared in Prince&#x27;s 1998 VHS &quot;Beautiful Strange&quot; and 1999 DVD &quot;Rave Un2 the Year 2000&quot;. He has since appeared with Prince at various international venues.

Graham and Graham Central Station performed internationally with a world tour in 2010 and the &quot;Funk Around the World&quot; international tour in 2011. He appeared with Andre Beeka as a special guest at Jim James&#x27; &quot;Rock N&#x27; Soul Dance Party Superjam&quot; at the 2013 Bonnaroo Music Festival.

== Personal life ==
Graham is the half-brother of Dennis Graham, and the uncle of Canadian rapper and actor Drake.

== Slap bass technique ==
Graham pioneered the slapping technique on the electric bass (he refers to it as &quot;thumpin&#x27; and pluckin&#x27;&quot;), in part to provide percussive and rhythmic elements to the bass line when his mother decided to no longer have a drummer in her band. This style couples a percussive thumb-slapping of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, the slap of the thumb used to emulate a bass drum and the pop of the index or middle finger a snare drum. The slap-and-pop technique also uses a lot of muted or &quot;dead&quot; notes, which adds to the rhythmic effect. Radically expanding the tonal palette of the bass, the style has become the archetype of modern funk. 

The slapping style was later used by such artists as Bootsy Collins (Parliament-Funkadelic), Prince, Les Claypool (Primus), Bernard Edwards (Chic), Louis Johnson, Mark King, Keni Burke, Victor Wooten, Kim Clarke of Defunkt, Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers), Marcus Miller, and Stanley Clarke.

<doc id="84634" wikidata="Q1428276" url="?curid=84634" title="Pandareus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pandareus () was the son of Merops and a nymph. His residence was given as either Ephesus or Miletus.

== Mythology ==
=== Crete ===
Pandareus was said to have been favored by Demeter, who conferred upon him the benefit of never suffering from indigestion, however much food he should eat. At the request of his impious friend, Tantalus, Pandareus stole a golden dog from a temple to Zeus on Crete (the dog had guarded Zeus during his infancy by the will of Rhea). According to various sources, he was either turned to stone or fled to Sicily, where he perished together with his wife Harmothoë. A Byzantine scholar, Eustathius of Thessalonica, writes that Pandareus and Tantalus attempted to steal a mechanic dog, crafted by Hephaestus himself, that was placed in a temple of Zeus in Crete. Zeus sent his son Hermes to steal the dog back and then punished the two thieves.

=== Anatolia ===
Pandareus was the father of Aëdon (wife of Zethus), Chelidon, Cleothera and Merope; according to Pausanias, the last two were called Cameiro and Clytia. Harmothoe is confirmed to be the mother of Aëdon, Merope and Cleodora, but not Chelidon. After the death of their parents, Aphrodite took care of Cleodora and Merope, Hera taught them to be proper women, and Athena made them accomplished; but when Aphrodite went to see Zeus to get them married, storm winds carried them away to become handmaidens of the furies.

In another myth, Aëdon&#x27;s husband Polytechnus came to him under the excuse that Aëdon wanted her sister Chelidon to visit her, when in fact he owed his wife a female slave. Pandareus, not suspecting a thing, let Polytechnus take Chelidon, but he proceeded to rape her and force her to serve as a slave for Aëdon. The two sisters soon escaped and ran back to Pandareus, who had Polytechnus tied, smeared with honey and left to the mercy of flies. Aëdon in pity kept the flies off of Polytechnus, angering Pandareus, his wife and his son. They were about to attack Aëdon, but Zeus interfered, and transformed them all into birds. Pandareus was changed into a sea eagle, his wife into a kingfisher, his son into a hoopoe.

<text>Pandarus or Pandar (Ancient Greek: Πάνδαρος &quot;Pándaros&quot;) is a Trojan aristocrat who appears in stories about the Trojan War. 

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; he is portrayed as an energetic and powerful warrior, but in medieval literature he becomes a witty and licentious figure who facilitates the affair between Troilus and Cressida. 

In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, he is portrayed as an aged degenerate and coward who ends the play by telling the audience he will bequeath them his &quot;diseases&quot;.

==Classical literature==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Pandarus is a renowned archer and the son of Lycaon. Pandarus, who fought on the side of Troy in the Trojan War and led a contingent from Zeleia, first appeared in Book Two of the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In Book Four, he is tricked by Athena, who wishes for the destruction of Troy and assumes the form of Laodocus, son of Antenor, to shoot and wound Menelaus with an arrow, sabotaging a truce that could potentially have led to the peaceful return of Helen of Troy. He then attempts to kill Diomedes at close range, since Athena is protecting him from his deadly arrows, while Aeneas acts as his charioteer. Diomedes narrowly survives the attack, though, retaliating with a deadly blow that knocks Pandarus out of the chariot. Diomedes then pursues Aeneas, who is saved by his mother Aphrodite.

Pandarus is also the name of a companion of Aeneas in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. His skull is cut in half vertically by Turnus&#x27; sword in Book IX of the Aeneid; this ending his life and causing a panic among the other Trojans.

==Later literature==

Pandarus appears in &quot;Il Filostrato&quot; by Giovanni Boccaccio, in which he plays the role of a go-between in the relationship of his cousin Criseyde and the Trojan prince Troilus, the younger brother of Paris and Hector. Boccaccio himself derived the story from &quot;Le Roman De Troie&quot;, by 12th-century poet Benoît de Sainte-Maure. This story is not part of classical Greek mythology. Both Pandarus and other characters in the medieval narrative who carry names from the &quot;Iliad&quot; are quite different from Homer&#x27;s characters of the same name.

In Geoffrey Chaucer’s poem &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; (1370), Pandarus plays the same role, though Chaucer&#x27;s Pandarus is Criseyde&#x27;s uncle, not her cousin. Chaucer&#x27;s Pandarus is of special interest because he is constructed as an expert rhetorician, who uses dozens of proverbs and proverbial sayings to bring the lovers Troilus and Criseyde together. When his linguistic fireworks fail at the end of the story, the proverb and human rhetoric in general are questioned as reliable means of communication. 

William Shakespeare used the medieval story again in his play &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; (1609). Shakespeare&#x27;s Pandarus is more of a bawd than Chaucer&#x27;s, as well as being lecherous and degenerate.

In &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Children&quot; by Anthony Trollope when the Duke of Omnium suspects Mrs Finn of encouraging his daughter&#x27;s romance he refers to her as a &#x27;she-Pandarus&#x27;.

In &quot;The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea&quot; by Yukio Mishima, Pandarus is mentioned briefly during an internal contemplation by the character Ryuji Tsukazaki.

==Pandering==
The plot function of the aging lecher Pandarus in Chaucer&#x27;s and Shakespeare&#x27;s famous works has given rise to the English terms &quot;a pander&quot; (in later usage &quot;a panderer&quot;), from Chaucer, meaning a person who furthers other people&#x27;s illicit sexual amours; and &quot;to pander&quot;, from Shakespeare, as a verb denoting the same activity. &quot;A panderer&quot; is, specifically, a bawd — a male who arranges access to female sexual favors: the manager of prostitutes. Thus, in law, the charge of &quot;pandering&quot; is an accusation that an individual has sold the sexual services of another. The verb &quot;to pander&quot; is also used in a more general sense to suggest active or implicit encouragement of someone&#x27;s weaknesses.

<text>OK Computer is the third studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 21 May 1997. With their producer, Nigel Godrich, Radiohead recorded most of &quot;OK Computer&quot; in their rehearsal space in Oxfordshire and the historic mansion of St Catherine&#x27;s Court in Bath in 1996 and early 1997. They distanced themselves from the guitar-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, &quot;The Bends&quot;. &quot;OK Computer&quot;″s abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead&#x27;s later, more experimental work.

The lyrics depict a dystopian world fraught with rampant consumerism, capitalism, social alienation, and political malaise, with themes such as transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. In this capacity, &quot;OK Computer&quot; is said to have prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. The band used unconventional production techniques, including natural reverberation, and no audio separation. Strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Most of the album was recorded live.

Despite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed it uncommercial and difficult to market, &quot;OK Computer&quot; reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Radiohead&#x27;s highest album entry on the US charts at the time, and was certified five times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in the UK and double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the US. It expanded Radiohead&#x27;s international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million copies worldwide. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;No Surprises&quot; were released as singles.

&quot;OK Computer&quot; received acclaim from critics and has been cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Alternative Music Album at the 1998 Grammy Awards. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from Britpop toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. In 2014, it was added by the US Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. A remastered version with additional tracks, &quot;OKNOTOK 1997 2017&quot;, was released in 2017. In 2019, in response to an internet leak, Radiohead released &quot;MiniDiscs [Hacked]&quot;, comprising hours of additional material.

==Background==
In 1995, Radiohead toured in support of their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995). Midway through the tour, Brian Eno commissioned them to contribute a song to &quot;The Help Album&quot;, a charity compilation organised by War Child; the album was to be recorded over the course of a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded &quot;Lucky&quot; in five hours with Nigel Godrich, who had engineered &quot;The Bends&quot; and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the session: &quot;Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there&#x27;s nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album.&quot; The singer, Thom Yorke, said &quot;Lucky&quot; shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: Lucky&#x27; was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall.&quot;

Radiohead found touring stressful and took a break in January 1996. They sought to move away from the introspective style of &quot;The Bends&quot;. The drummer, Philip Selway, said: &quot;There was an awful lot of soul-searching [on &quot;The Bends&quot;]. To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring.&quot; Yorke said he did not want to do &quot;another miserable, morbid and negative record&quot;, and was &quot;writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I&#x27;m not able to put them into music yet and I don&#x27;t want to just force it.&quot;

The critical and commercial success of &quot;The Bends&quot; gave Radiohead the confidence to self-produce their third album. Their label, Parlophone, gave them a £100,000 budget for recording equipment. The lead guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, said &quot;the only concept that we had for this album was that we wanted to record it away from the city and that we wanted to record it ourselves&quot;. According to the guitarist Ed O&#x27;Brien, &quot;Everyone said, &#x27;You&#x27;ll sell six or seven million if you bring out &quot;The Bends Pt 2&quot;,&#x27; and we&#x27;re like, &#x27;We&#x27;ll kick against that and do the opposite&#x27;.&quot; A number of producers were suggested, including major figures such as Scott Litt, but Radiohead were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on equipment, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own, including a plate reverberator purchased from the songwriter Jona Lewie. Although Godrich had sought to focus on electronic dance music, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album&#x27;s co-producer.

==Recording==
In early 1996, Radiohead recorded demos at Chipping Norton Recording Studios, Oxfordshire. In July, they began rehearsing and recording in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline that contributed to the stress of &quot;The Bends&quot;, the band had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: &quot;We&#x27;re jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we&#x27;d move on to a new song ... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we&#x27;d move on, because so much work had gone into them.&quot;

The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly &quot;the loudest voice&quot;, according to O&#x27;Brien. Selway said, &quot;We give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, but at the same time we are all very critical about what the other person is doing.&quot; Godrich&#x27;s role as co-producer was part collaborator and part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead &quot;need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they&#x27;re all playing together, to say when the take goes well ... I take up slack when people aren&#x27;t taking responsibility—the term &#x27;producing a record&#x27; means taking responsibility for the record ... It&#x27;s my job to ensure that they get the ideas across.&quot; Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;sixth member&quot;, an allusion to George Martin&#x27;s nickname as the &quot;fifth Beatle&quot;.

Radiohead decided that Canned Applause was an unsatisfactory recording location, which Yorke attributed to its proximity to the band members&#x27; homes, and Jonny Greenwood attributed to its lack of dining and bathroom facilities. The group had nearly completed four songs: &quot;Electioneering&quot;, &quot;No Surprises&quot;, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; and &quot;The Tourist&quot;. They took a break from recording to embark on an American tour in 1996, opening for Alanis Morissette, performing early versions of several new songs. Jonny Greenwood said his main memory of the tour was of &quot;playing interminable Hammond organ solos to an audience full of quietly despairing teenage girls&quot;.

During the tour, Baz Luhrmann commissioned Radiohead to write a song for his upcoming film &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: &quot;When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt .45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately.&quot; Soon afterwards, Radiohead wrote and recorded &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot;, which plays over the film&#x27;s end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at their request. The song helped shape the direction of the rest of the album. Yorke said it &quot;was the first performance we&#x27;d ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin—something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment.&quot;

Radiohead resumed recording in September 1996 at St Catherine&#x27;s Court, a historic mansion near Bath owned by the actress Jane Seymour. It was unoccupied but sometimes used for corporate functions. The change of setting marked an important transition in the recording process. Greenwood said it &quot;was less like a laboratory experiment, which is what being in a studio is usually like, and more about a group of people making their first record together&quot;. 

The band made extensive use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot; feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and &quot;Let Down&quot; was recorded in a ballroom at 3 am. Isolation allowed the band to work at a different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O&#x27;Brien said that &quot;the biggest pressure was actually completing [the recording]. We weren&#x27;t given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff.&quot; 

Yorke was satisfied with the recordings made at the house, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O&#x27;Brien estimated that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: &quot;I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn&#x27;t feel natural. ... Something special happens when you&#x27;re playing live; a lot of it is just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen.&quot; Many of Yorke&#x27;s vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would &quot;start to think about it and it would sound really lame&quot;.

Radiohead returned to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of &quot;OK Computer&quot; in further sessions at St. Catherine&#x27;s Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. Additional recording took place at the Church in Crouch End, London. The strings were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. Godrich mixed &quot;OK Computer&quot; at various London studios. He preferred a quick and &quot;hands-off&quot; approach to mixing, and said: &quot;I feel like I get too into it. I start fiddling with things and I fuck it up ... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it&#x27;s any longer than that, you lose it. The hardest thing is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective.&quot; &quot;OK Computer&quot; was mastered by Chris Blair at Abbey Road and completed on 6 March 1997.

==Music and lyrics==

===Style and influences===
Yorke said that the starting point for the record was the &quot;incredibly dense and terrifying sound&quot; of &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; to &quot;Q&quot;: &quot;It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that&#x27;s the beauty of it. It was at the core of what we were trying to do with &quot;OK Computer&quot;.&quot; Yorke identified &quot;I&#x27;ll Wear It Proudly&quot; by Elvis Costello, &quot;Fall on Me&quot; by R.E.M., &quot;Dress&quot; by PJ Harvey and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by the Beatles as particularly influential on his songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as &quot;abusing the recording process&quot;. Jonny Greenwood described &quot;OK Computer&quot; as a product of being &quot;in love with all these brilliant records ... trying to recreate them, and missing&quot;.

According to Yorke, Radiohead hoped to achieve an &quot;atmosphere that&#x27;s perhaps a bit shocking when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;&quot;. They extended their instrumentation to include electric piano, Mellotron, and glockenspiel. Jonny Greenwood summarised the exploratory approach as &quot;when we&#x27;ve got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they&#x27;re gonna play on it&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; characterised &quot;OK Computer&quot; as sounding like &quot;a DIY electronica album made with guitars&quot;.

Critics suggested a stylistic debt to 1970s progressive rock, an influence that Radiohead have disavowed. According to Andy Greene in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Radiohead &quot;were collectively hostile to seventies progressive rock ... but that didn&#x27;t stop them from reinventing prog from scratch on &quot;OK Computer&quot;, particularly on the six-and-a-half-minute &#x27;Paranoid Android&#x27;.&quot; Tom Hull believed the album was &quot;still prog, but may just be because rock has so thoroughly enveloped musical storytelling that this sort of thing has become inevitable.&quot; Writing in 2017, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Kelefa Sanneh said &quot;OK Computer&quot; &quot;was profoundly prog: grand and dystopian, with a lead single that was more than six minutes long&quot;.

===Lyrics===
The album&#x27;s lyrics, written by Yorke, are more abstract compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for &quot;The Bends&quot;. Critic Alex Ross said the lyrics &quot;seemed a mixture of overheard conversations, techno-speak, and fragments of a harsh diary&quot; with &quot;images of riot police at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, yuppies freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead.&quot; Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, globalisation and anti-capitalism. Yorke said: &quot;On this album, the outside world became all there was ... I&#x27;m just taking Polaroids of things around me moving too fast.&quot; He told &quot;Q&quot;: &quot;It was like there&#x27;s a secret camera in a room and it&#x27;s watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera&#x27;s not quite me. It&#x27;s neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite.&quot; Yorke also drew inspiration from books, including Noam Chomsky&#x27;s political writing, Eric Hobsbawm&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Extremes&quot;, Will Hutton&#x27;s &quot;The State We&#x27;re In&quot;, Jonathan Coe&#x27;s &quot;What a Carve Up!&quot; and Philip K. Dick&#x27;s &quot;VALIS&quot;.

The songs of &quot;OK Computer&quot; do not have a coherent narrative, and the album&#x27;s lyrics are generally considered abstract or oblique. Nonetheless, many musical critics, journalists, and scholars consider the album to be a concept album or song cycle, or have analysed it as a concept album, noting its strong thematic cohesion, aesthetic unity, and the structural logic of the song sequencing. Although the songs share common themes, Radiohead have said they do not consider &quot;OK Computer&quot; a concept album and did not intend to link the songs through a narrative or unifying concept while it was being written. Jonny Greenwood said: &quot;I think one album title and one computer voice do not make a concept album. That&#x27;s a bit of a red herring.&quot; However, the band intended the album to be heard as a whole, and spent two weeks ordering the track list. O&#x27;Brien said: &quot;The context of each song is really important ... It&#x27;s not a concept album but there is a continuity there.&quot;

===Composition===

====Tracks 1–6====
The opening track, &quot;Airbag&quot;, is underpinned by a beat built from a seconds-long recording of Selway&#x27;s drumming. The band sampled the drum track with a sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, inspired by the music of DJ Shadow, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow&#x27;s style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The original draft of the lyrics for &quot;Airbag&quot; were written inside a copy of William Blake&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot; that Yorke had also annotated with his own notes; this personal copy was later auctioned off by Yorke in 2016 with proceeds going to Oxfam. The song&#x27;s references to automobile crashes and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled &quot;An Airbag Saved My Life&quot; and &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;. Yorke wrote &quot;Airbag&quot; about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and &quot;the idea that whenever you go out on the road you could be killed&quot;. The BBC wrote about the influence of J. G. Ballard, especially his 1973 novel &quot;Crash&quot;, on the lyrics. Music journalist Tim Footman noted that the song&#x27;s technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrated the &quot;key paradox&quot; of the album: &quot;The musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact ... It&#x27;s a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the &#x27;real&#x27; guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums.&quot;

Split into four sections with an overall running time of 6:23, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; is among the band&#x27;s longest songs. The unconventional structure was inspired by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; and Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which also eschew a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. Its musical style was also inspired by the music of the Pixies. The song was written by Yorke after an unpleasant night at a Los Angeles bar, where he saw a woman react violently after someone spilled a drink on her. Its title and lyrics are a reference to Marvin the Paranoid Android from Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series.

The use of electric keyboards in &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; is an example of the band&#x27;s attempts to emulate the atmosphere of &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. Its title references the Bob Dylan song &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, and the lyrics describe an isolated narrator who fantasises about being abducted by extraterrestrials. The narrator speculates that, upon returning to Earth, his friends would not believe his story and he would remain a misfit. The lyrics were inspired by an assignment from Yorke&#x27;s time at Abingdon School to write a piece of &quot;Martian poetry&quot;, a British literary movement that humorously recontextualises mundane aspects of human life from an alien perspective.

William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; inspired the lyrics for &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot;. Initially Yorke wanted to work lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: &quot;I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn&#x27;t understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn&#x27;t just run away. It&#x27;s a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts.&quot; Yorke compared the opening of the song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot;. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that the bassist, Colin Greenwood, called more &quot;stilted and leaden and mechanical&quot;. The song concludes by fading back to Yorke&#x27;s voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.

&quot;Let Down&quot; contains multilayered arpeggiated guitars and electric piano. Jonny Greenwood plays his guitar part in a different time signature to the other instruments. O&#x27;Brien said the song was influenced by Phil Spector, a producer and songwriter best known for his reverberating &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; recording techniques. The lyrics, Yorke said, are about a fear of being trapped, and &quot;about that feeling that you get when you&#x27;re in transit but you&#x27;re not in control of it—you just go past thousands of places and thousands of people and you&#x27;re completely removed from it&quot;. Of the line &quot;Don&#x27;t get sentimental / It always ends up drivel&quot;, Yorke said: &quot;Sentimentality is being emotional for the sake of it. We&#x27;re bombarded with sentiment, people emoting. That&#x27;s the Let Down. Feeling every emotion is fake. Or rather every emotion is on the same plane whether it&#x27;s a car advert or a pop song.&quot; Yorke felt that scepticism of emotion was characteristic of Generation X and that it had informed the band&#x27;s approach to the album.

&quot;Karma Police&quot; has two main verses that alternate with a subdued break, followed by a different ending section. The verses centre around acoustic guitar and piano, with a chord progression indebted to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot;. Starting at 2:34, the song transitions into an orchestrated section with the repeated line &quot;For a minute there, I lost myself&quot;. It ends with feedback generated with a delay effect. The title and lyrics to &quot;Karma Police&quot; originate from an in-joke during &quot;The Bends&quot; tour; Jonny Greenwood said &quot;whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way, we&#x27;d say &#x27;The karma police will catch up with him sooner or later.

====Tracks 7–12====
&quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is a short musique concrète track that consists of sampled musical and background sound and spoken-word lyrics recited by &quot;Fred&quot;, a synthesised voice from the Macintosh SimpleText application. Yorke wrote the lyrics &quot;in ten minutes&quot; after a period of writer&#x27;s block while the rest of the band were playing. He described the words as a checklist of slogans for the 1990s; he considered it &quot;the most upsetting thing I&#x27;ve ever written&quot;, and said it was &quot;liberating&quot; to give the words to a neutral-sounding computer voice. Among the samples in the background is a loop from the 1975 film &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;. The band considered using &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; as the album&#x27;s opening track, but decided the effect was off-putting.

Steve Lowe called the song &quot;penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations&#x27; lifestyles&quot; with &quot;a repugnance for prevailing yuppified social values&quot;. Among the loosely connected imagery of the lyrics, Footman identified the song&#x27;s subject as &quot;the materially comfortable, morally empty embodiment of modern, Western humanity, half-salaryman, half-Stepford Wife, destined for the metaphorical farrowing crate, propped up on Prozac, Viagra and anything else his insurance plan can cover.&quot; Sam Steele called the lyrics &quot;a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is the hum of a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be that we live in such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice.&quot;

&quot;Electioneering&quot;, featuring a cowbell and a distorted guitar solo, is the album&#x27;s most rock-oriented track and one of the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead&#x27;s earlier style on &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;. The cynical &quot;Electioneering&quot; is the album&#x27;s most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the Poll Tax Riots. The song was also inspired by Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;, a book analysing contemporary mass media under the propaganda model. Yorke likened its lyrics, which focus on political and artistic compromise, to &quot;a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones&quot;. Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, &quot;What can you say about the IMF, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. What can you say? You just write down &#x27;Cattle prods and the IMF&#x27; and people who know, know.&quot; O&#x27;Brien said the song was about the promotional cycle of touring: &quot;After a while you feel like a politician who has to kiss babies and shake hands all day long.&quot;

&quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot; – described by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;monumental chaos&quot; – is layered with a string section, ambient noise and repetitive, metallic percussion. The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by modern classical composer Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima&quot;. Greenwood said, &quot;I got very excited at the prospect of doing string parts that didn&#x27;t sound like &#x27;Eleanor Rigby&#x27;, which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; described Yorke&#x27;s distraught vocals and the atonal strings as &quot;Thom&#x27;s voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo&quot;. For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the Care in the Community policy of deinstitutionalising mental health patients, and a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about serial killers. He said:

&quot;No Surprises&quot;, recorded in a single take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot;), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s 1968 recording of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Yorke identified the subject of the song as &quot;someone who&#x27;s trying hard to keep it together but can&#x27;t&quot;. The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, &quot;a heart that&#x27;s full up like a landfill&quot;; according to Yorke, the song is a &quot;fucked-up nursery rhyme&quot; that &quot;stems from my unhealthy obsession of what to do with plastic boxes and plastic bottles ... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn&#x27;t rot, it just stays there. That&#x27;s how we deal, that&#x27;s how I deal with stuff, I bury it.&quot; The song&#x27;s gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, &quot;even when the subject is suicide ... O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child&#x27;s prayer.&quot;

&quot;Lucky&quot; was inspired by the Bosnian War. Sam Taylor said it was &quot;the one track on [&quot;The Help Album&quot;] to capture the sombre terror of the conflict&quot;, and that its serious subject matter and dark tone made the band &quot;too &#x27;real&#x27; to be allowed on the Britpop gravy train&quot;. The lyrics were pared down from many pages of notes, and were originally more politically explicit. The lyrics depict a man surviving an aeroplane crash and are drawn from Yorke&#x27;s anxiety about transportation. The musical centerpiece of &quot;Lucky&quot; is its three-piece guitar arrangement, which grew out of the high-pitched chiming sound played by O&#x27;Brien in the song&#x27;s introduction, achieved by strumming above the guitar nut. Critics likened its lead guitar to Pink Floyd and, more broadly, arena rock.

The album ends with &quot;The Tourist&quot;, which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where something &quot;doesn&#x27;t have to happen ... every three seconds&quot;. He said, The Tourist&#x27; doesn&#x27;t sound like Radiohead at all. It has become a song with space.&quot; The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it was chosen as the closing track because &quot;a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast and not being able to keep up. It was really obvious to have &#x27;Tourist&#x27; as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, &#x27;Idiot, slow down.&#x27; Because at that point, I &quot;needed&quot; to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down.&quot; The &quot;unexpectedly bluesy waltz&quot; draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.

==Title==
The title &quot;OK Computer&quot; is taken from the 1978 radio series &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, in which the character Zaphod Beeblebrox speaks the phrase &quot;Okay, computer, I want full manual control now.&quot; The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. &quot;OK Computer&quot; became a working title for &quot;Palo Alto&quot;, a B-side for the single &quot;No Surprises&quot;. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, it &quot;started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with what we were trying to do&quot;.

Yorke said the title &quot;refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else&#x27;s. It&#x27;s to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on ... and the sound it makes.&quot; He described the title as &quot;a really resigned, terrified phrase&quot;, to him similar to the Coca-Cola advertisement &quot;I&#x27;d Like to Teach the World to Sing&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac&#x27;s speech recognition software responds to the command &quot;OK computer&quot; as an alternative to clicking the &quot;OK&quot; button. Other titles considered were &quot;Ones and Zeroes&quot;—a reference to the binary numeral system—and &quot;Your Home May Be at Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Payments&quot;.

==Artwork==

The &quot;OK Computer&quot; artwork is a collage of images and text created by Yorke (credited as the White Chocolate Farm) and Stanley Donwood. Yorke commissioned Donwood to work on a visual diary alongside the recording sessions. He said he did not feel confident in his music until he saw a visual representation to accompany it. According to Donwood, the blue-and-white palette was the result of &quot;trying to make something the colour of bleached bone&quot;.

The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the liner notes and on the disc label in CD and LP releases. Yorke said the image symbolised exploitation: &quot;Someone&#x27;s being sold something they don&#x27;t really want, and someone&#x27;s being friendly because they&#x27;re trying to sell something. That&#x27;s what it means to me.&quot; The image was later used on the cover for &quot;&quot; (2008). Explaining the artwork&#x27;s themes, Yorke said, &quot;It&#x27;s quite sad, and quite funny as well. All the artwork and so on ... It was all the things that I hadn&#x27;t said in the songs.&quot;

Motifs in the artwork include motorways, aeroplanes, families, corporate logos and cityscapes. The photograph of a motorway on the cover was likely taken in Hartford, Connecticut, where Radiohead performed in 1996. The words &quot;Lost Child&quot; feature prominently, and the booklet artwork contains phrases in the constructed language Esperanto and health-related instructions in both English and Greek. The &quot;Uncut&quot; critic David Cavanagh said the use of non-sequiturs created an effect &quot;akin to being lifestyle-coached by a lunatic&quot;. White scribbles, Donwood&#x27;s method of correcting mistakes rather than using the computer function undo, are present everywhere in the collages.

The liner notes contain the full lyrics, rendered with atypical syntax, alternate spelling and small annotations. The lyrics are also arranged and spaced in shapes that resemble hidden images. In keeping with Radiohead&#x27;s emerging anti-corporate stance, the production credits contain the ironic copyright notice &quot;Lyrics reproduced by kind permission even though we wrote them.&quot;

==Release and promotion==
===Commercial expectations===
According to Selway, Radiohead&#x27;s American label Capitol saw the album as commercial suicide&#x27;. They weren&#x27;t really into it. At that point, we got the fear. How is this going to be received?&quot; Yorke recalled: &quot;When we first gave it to Capitol, they were taken aback. I don&#x27;t really know why it&#x27;s so important now, but I&#x27;m excited about it.&quot; Capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million to half a million. In O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s view, only Parlophone, the band&#x27;s British label, remained optimistic, while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates. Label representatives were reportedly disappointed with the lack of marketable songs, especially the absence of anything resembling Radiohead&#x27;s 1992 hit &quot;Creep&quot;. &quot;&quot;OK Computer&quot; isn&#x27;t the album we&#x27;re going to rule the world with&quot;, Colin Greenwood predicted at the time. &quot;It&#x27;s not as hitting-everything-loudly-whilst-waggling-the-tongue-in-and-out, like &quot;The Bends&quot;. There&#x27;s less of the Van Halen factor.&quot;

===Marketing===
Parlophone launched an unorthodox advertising campaign, taking full-page advertisements in high-profile British newspapers and tube stations with lyrics for &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; in large black letters against white backgrounds. The same lyrics, and artwork adapted from the album, were repurposed for shirt designs. Yorke said they chose the &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; lyrics to link what a critic called &quot;a coherent set of concerns&quot; between the album artwork and its promotional material.

Other unconventional merchandise included a floppy disk containing Radiohead screensavers and an FM radio in the shape of a desktop computer. In America, Capitol sent 1,000 cassette players to prominent members of the press and music industry, each with a copy of the album permanently glued inside. Gary Gersh, Capitol&#x27;s president, said: &quot;Our job is just to take them as a left-of-centre band and bring the centre to them. That&#x27;s our focus, and we won&#x27;t let up until they&#x27;re the biggest band in the world.&quot;

Radiohead planned to produce a video for every song on the album, but the project was abandoned due to financial and time constraints. According to Grant Gee, the director of the &quot;No Surprises&quot; video, the plan was cancelled when the videos for &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and &quot;Karma Police&quot; went over budget. Also cancelled were plans for the trip hop group Massive Attack to remix the album.

Radiohead&#x27;s website was created to promote the album, which went live at the time of its release, making the band one of the first to manage an online presence. The first major Radiohead fansite, Atease, was created shortly following the album&#x27;s release, with its title taken from &quot;Fitter Happier&quot;. In 2017, for &quot;OK Computer&quot;″s 20th anniversary, Radiohead temporarily restored their website to its 1997 state.

===Singles===
Radiohead chose &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; as the lead single, despite its unusually long running time and lack of a catchy chorus. Colin Greenwood said the song was &quot;hardly the radio-friendly, breakthrough, buzz bin unit shifter [radio stations] can have been expecting&quot;, but that Capitol supported the choice. The song premiered on the Radio 1 programme &quot;The Evening Session&quot; in April 1997 and was released as a single in May 1997. On the strength of frequent radio play on Radio 1 and rotation of the song&#x27;s music video on MTV, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; reached number three in the UK, giving Radiohead their highest chart position.

&quot;Karma Police&quot; was released in August 1997 and &quot;No Surprises&quot; in January 1998. Both singles charted in the UK top ten, and &quot;Karma Police&quot; peaked at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Lucky&quot; was released as a single in France, but did not chart. &quot;Let Down&quot;, considered for release as the lead single, was issued as a promotional single in September 1997 and charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 29.

===Tour===
Radiohead embarked on the &quot;Against Demons&quot; world tour in promotion of &quot;OK Computer&quot;, commencing at the album launch in Barcelona on 22 May 1997. They toured the UK and Ireland, continental Europe, North America, Japan and Australasia, concluding on 18 April 1998 in New York. A documentary by Grant Gee following Radiohead on the tour, &quot;Meeting People Is Easy&quot;, premiered in November 1998.

The tour was taxing for the band, particularly Yorke, who said: &quot;That tour was a year too long. I was the first person to tire of it, then six months later everyone in the band was saying it. Then six months after that, nobody was talking any more.&quot; In 2003, Colin Greenwood said the tour was the lowest point in Radiohead&#x27;s career: &quot;There is nothing worse than having to play in front of 20,000 people when someone—when Thom—absolutely does not want to be there, and you can see that hundred-yard stare in his eyes. You hate having to put your friend through that experience.&quot;

The tour included Radiohead&#x27;s first headline performance at Glastonbury Festival on 28 June 1997. Despite technical problems that almost caused Yorke to abandon the stage, the performance was acclaimed and cemented Radiohead as a major live act. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;an absolute triumph&quot;, and in 2004 &quot;Q&quot; named it the greatest concert of all time. In 2023, the &quot;Guardian&quot; named it the greatest Glastonbury headline set, writing that &quot;frustration and tension led to the band playing out of their skins, adding a startling potency to a set that confirmed &quot;OK Computer&quot; as the defining sound of rock&#x27;s post-Britpop shift&quot;.

===Sales===
&quot;OK Computer&quot; was released in Japan on 21 May, in the UK on 16 June, in Canada on 17 June and in the US on 1 July. It was released on CD, double-LP vinyl record, cassette and MiniDisc. It debuted at number one in the UK with sales of 136,000 copies in its first week. In the US, it debuted at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It held the number-one spot in the UK for two weeks and stayed in the top ten for several more, becoming the UK&#x27;s eighth-bestselling record that year.

By February 1998, &quot;OK Computer&quot; had sold at least half a million copies in the UK and 2million worldwide. By September 2000, it had sold 4.5million copies worldwide. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that by June 2001 it had sold 1.4 million copies in the US, and in April 2006 the IFPI announced it had sold 3 million copies across Europe. In the UK, it was certified gold in June 1997, platinum in July, and five-times platinum in August 2013. It is certified double platinum in the US, in addition to certifications in other markets. By May 2016, Nielsen SoundScan figures showed &quot;OK Computer&quot; had sold 2.5million digital album units in the US, plus 900,000 sales measured in album-equivalent units. Twenty years to the week after its release, the Official Charts Company recorded total UK sales of 1.5million, including album-equivalent units. Tallying American and European sales, &quot;OK Computer&quot; has sold at least 6.9 million copies worldwide (or 7.8 million with album-equivalent units).

==Critical reception==
&quot;OK Computer&quot; received acclaim. Critics described it as a landmark release of far-reaching impact and importance, but noted that its experimentalism made it a challenging listen. According to Tim Footman, &quot;Not since 1967, with the release of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, had so many major critics agreed immediately, not only on an album&#x27;s merits, but on its long-term significance, and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history.&quot; In the British press, the album garnered favourable reviews in &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. Nick Kent wrote in &quot;Mojo&quot; that &quot;Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years&#x27; time I&#x27;m betting &quot;OK Computer&quot; will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era.&quot; John Harris wrote in &quot;Select&quot;: &quot;Every word sounds achingly sincere, every note spewed from the heart, and yet it roots itself firmly in a world of steel, glass, random-access memory and prickly-skinned paranoia.&quot;

The album was well received by critics in North America. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; published positive reviews. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Alex Ross praised its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead&#x27;s risk-taking with the musically conservative &quot;dadrock&quot; of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote: &quot;Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme ... This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock.&quot; Ryan Schreiber of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; lauded the record&#x27;s emotional appeal, writing that it &quot;is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing&quot;.

Reviews for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; were mixed. Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said Radiohead immersed Yorke&#x27;s vocals in &quot;enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month&quot; to compensate for the &quot;soulless&quot; songs, resulting in &quot;arid&quot; art rock. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for &quot;The Independent:&quot; &quot;For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, &quot;OK Computer&quot; is not, finally, as impressive as &quot;The Bends&quot;, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;OK Computer&quot; was nominated for Grammy Awards as Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Album at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in 1998, winning the latter. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album was shortlisted for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognising the best British or Irish album of the year. The day before the winner was announced, oddsmakers gave &quot;OK Computer&quot; the best chance to win among ten nominees, but it lost to &quot;New Forms&quot; by Roni Size/Reprazent. 

&quot;OK Computer&quot; was named the best album of the year by &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Hot Press&quot;, &quot;Muziekkrant OOR&quot;, &quot;HUMO&quot;, &quot;Eye Weekly&quot; and &quot;Inpress&quot;, and tied for first place with Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;Homework&quot; in &quot;The Face&quot;. It was named the second-best in &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Uncut&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; listed the album in their year-end polls.

The praise overwhelmed the band. Jonny Greenwood felt it had been exaggerated because &quot;The Bends&quot; had been &quot;under-reviewed possibly and under-received&quot;. Radiohead rejected links to progressive rock and art rock, despite comparisons to Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Yorke responded: &quot;We write pop songs ... There was no intention of it being &#x27;art&#x27;. It&#x27;s a reflection of all the disparate things we were listening to when we recorded it.&quot; He was nevertheless pleased that listeners identified their influences: &quot;What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create.&quot;

==Legacy==

===Retrospective appraisal===
&quot;OK Computer&quot; has frequently appeared in professional lists of the greatest albums of all time. A number of publications, including &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; and &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed &quot;OK Computer&quot; prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. It was voted number 4 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 42 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2020. It was previously ranked at 162 in 2003 and 2012. In 2019, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; ranked it at 47 in its list of &quot;The 50 best rock albums of all time&quot;: &quot;Combining prog with alternative influences, they came up with a style that was supple, subtle and sensuous. This wasn&#x27;t Pink Floyd for the end of the millennium, it was original, visionary and brilliant [...] An epochal album that called time on the narrow colloquial nostalgia of Britpop, sold millions and turned Radiohead into global angst-rock superstars, &quot;OK Computer&quot; is not quite the flawless masterpiece of fond folklore, but it holds up extremely well.&quot;

Retrospective reviews from BBC Music, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; and &quot;Slant&quot; were favourable. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album five out of five in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, with Rob Sheffield writing: &quot;Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering.&quot; Christgau said later that &quot;most would rate &quot;OK Computer&quot; the apogee of pomo texture&quot;. In 2014, the United States National Recording Preservation Board selected the album for preservation in the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress, which designates it as a sound recording that has had significant cultural, historical or aesthetic impact in American life. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Kevin Dettmar of described it as the record that made modern world possible for alternative rock music.

&quot;OK Computer&quot; has been cited by some as undeserving of its acclaim. In a poll surveying thousands conducted by BBC Radio 6 Music, &quot;OK Computer&quot; was named the sixth-most overrated album. David H. Green of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called the album &quot;self-indulgent whingeing&quot; and maintains that the positive critical consensus towards &quot;OK Computer&quot; is an indication of &quot;a 20th-century delusion that rock is the bastion of serious commentary on popular music&quot; to the detriment of electronic and dance music. The album was selected as an entry in &quot;Sacred Cows&quot;, an &quot;NME&quot; column questioning the critical status of &quot;revered albums&quot;, in which Henry Yates said &quot;there&#x27;s no defiance, gallows humour or chink of light beneath the curtain, just a sense of meek, resigned despondency&quot; and criticised the record as &quot;the moment when Radiohead stopped being &#x27;good&#x27; [compared to &quot;The Bends&quot;] and started being &#x27;important. In a &quot;Spin&quot; article on the &quot;myth&quot; that &quot;Radiohead Can Do No Wrong&quot;, Chris Norris argues that the acclaim for &quot;OK Computer&quot; inflated expectations for subsequent Radiohead releases. Christgau felt &quot;the reason the readers of the British magazine &quot;Q&quot; absurdly voted &quot;OK Computer&quot; the greatest album of the 20th century is that it integrated what was briefly called electronica into rock&quot;. Having deemed it &quot;self-regarding&quot; and overrated, he later warmed to the record and found it indicative of Radiohead&#x27;s cerebral sensibility and &quot;rife with discrete pleasures and surprises&quot;.

===Commentary, interpretation and analysis===
&quot;OK Computer&quot; was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election and released a month after the victory of Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour government. The album was perceived by critics as an expression of dissent and scepticism toward the new government and a reaction against the national mood of optimism. Dorian Lynskey wrote, &quot;On May 1, 1997, Labour supporters toasted their landslide victory to the sound of &#x27;Things Can Only Get Better.&#x27; A few weeks later, &quot;OK Computer&quot; appeared like Banquo&#x27;s ghost to warn: &quot;No, things can only get worse&quot;.&quot; According to Amy Britton, the album &quot;showed not everyone was ready to join the party, instead tapping into another feeling felt throughout the UK—pre-millennial angst. ... huge corporations were impossible to fight against—this was the world &quot;OK Computer&quot; soundtracked, not the wave of British optimism.&quot;

In an interview, Yorke doubted that Blair&#x27;s policies would differ from the preceding two decades of Conservative government. He said the public reaction to the death of Princess Diana was more significant, as a moment when the British public realised &quot;the royals had had us by the balls for the last hundred years, as had the media and the state.&quot; The band&#x27;s distaste with the commercialised promotion of &quot;OK Computer&quot; reinforced their anti-capitalist politics, which would be further explored on their subsequent releases.

Critics have compared Radiohead&#x27;s statements of political dissatisfaction to those of earlier rock bands. David Stubbs said that, where punk rock had been a rebellion against a time of deficit and poverty, &quot;OK Computer&quot; protested the &quot;mechanistic convenience&quot; of contemporary surplus and excess. Alex Ross said the album &quot;pictured the onslaught of the Information Age and a young person&#x27;s panicky embrace of it&quot; and made the band into &quot;the poster boys for a certain kind of knowing alienation—as Talking Heads and R.E.M. had been before.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found precedents in the work of Pink Floyd and Madness for Radiohead&#x27;s concerns &quot;about a culture of numbness, building docile workers and enforced by self-help regimes and anti-depressants&quot;.

The album&#x27;s tone has been described as millennial or futuristic, anticipating cultural and political trends. According to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; writer Steven Hyden in the feature &quot;Whatever Happened to Alternative Nation&quot;, &quot;Radiohead appeared to be ahead of the curve, forecasting the paranoia, media-driven insanity, and omnipresent sense of impending doom that&#x27;s subsequently come to characterise everyday life in the 21st century.&quot; In &quot;1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;, Tom Moon described &quot;OK Computer&quot; as a &quot;prescient ... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology ... oozing [with] a vague sense of dread, and a touch of Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11.&quot; Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, &quot;It would be interesting to see how the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;. I think the world would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn&#x27;t it change his?&quot;

The album inspired a radio play, also titled &quot;OK Computer&quot;, which was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2007. The play, written by Joel Horwood, Chris Perkins, Al Smith and Chris Thorpe, interprets the album into a story about a man who awakens in a Berlin hospital with memory loss and returns to England with doubts that the life he&#x27;s returned to is his own.
===Influence===


The release of &quot;OK Computer&quot; coincided with the decline of Britpop. Alexis Petridis of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the album &quot;the defining sound of rock&#x27;s post-Britpop shift&quot;. Through &quot;OK Computer&quot;″s influence, the dominant UK guitar pop shifted toward an approximation of &quot;Radiohead&#x27;s paranoid but confessional, slurry but catchy&quot; approach. Many newer British acts adopted similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements; for example, the post-Britpop band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of &quot;The Man Who&quot;, which became the fourth best-selling album of 1999 in the UK. Some in the British press accused Travis of appropriating Radiohead&#x27;s sound. Steven Hyden of &quot;AV Club&quot; said that by 1999, starting with &quot;The Man Who&quot;, &quot;what Radiohead had created in &quot;OK Computer&quot; had already grown much bigger than the band,&quot; and that the album went on to influence &quot;a wave of British-rock balladeers that reached its zenith in the &#x27;00s&quot;.

&quot;OK Computer&quot; influenced the next generation of British alternative rock bands, and musicians in a variety of genres have praised it. Bloc Party and TV on the Radio listened to or were influenced by &quot;OK Computer&quot;; TV on the Radio&#x27;s debut album was titled &quot;OK Calculator&quot; as a lighthearted tribute. Radiohead described the pervasiveness of bands that &quot;sound like us&quot; as one reason to break with the style of &quot;OK Computer&quot; for their next album, &quot;Kid A&quot;.

Although &quot;OK Computer&quot;″s influence on rock is widely acknowledged, several critics believe that its experimental inclination was not authentically embraced on a wide scale. Footman said the &quot;Radiohead Lite&quot; bands that followed were &quot;missing [&quot;OK Computer&quot;] sonic inventiveness, not to mention the lyrical substance&quot;. David Cavanagh said that most of &quot;OK Computer&quot;″s purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from the ballads on &quot;The Bends&quot;. According to Cavanagh, &quot;The populist albums of the post-&quot;OK Computer&quot; era—the Verve&#x27;s &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, Travis&#x27;s &quot;Good Feeling&quot;, Stereophonics&#x27; &quot;Word Gets Around&quot;, Robbie Williams&#x27; &quot;Life thru a Lens&quot;—effectively closed the door that &quot;OK Computer&quot;″s boffin-esque inventiveness had opened.&quot; John Harris believed that &quot;OK Computer&quot; was one of the &quot;fleeting signs that British rock music might [have been] returning to its inventive traditions&quot; in the wake of Britpop&#x27;s demise. While Harris concludes that British rock ultimately developed an &quot;altogether more conservative tendency&quot;, he said that with &quot;OK Computer&quot; and their subsequent material, Radiohead provided a &quot;clarion call&quot; to fill the void left by Britpop. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; journalist Marc Hogan argued that &quot;OK Computer&quot; marked an &quot;ending point&quot; for the rock-oriented album era, as its mainstream and critical success remained unmatched by any rock album since.

&quot;OK Computer&quot; triggered a minor revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, with a new wave of prog-influenced bands crediting &quot;OK Computer&quot; for enabling their scene to thrive. Brandon Curtis of Secret Machines said, &quot;Songs like &#x27;Paranoid Android&#x27; made it OK to write music differently, to be more experimental ... &quot;OK Computer&quot; was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures.&quot; Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think ambition is a dirty word any more. Radiohead were the Trojan Horse in that respect. Here&#x27;s a band that came from the indie rock tradition that snuck in under the radar when the journalists weren&#x27;t looking and started making these absurdly ambitious and pretentious—and all the better for it—records.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Q&quot; named &quot;OK Computer&quot; the tenth-best progressive rock album, and in 2014 it was voted the 87th-greatest by readers of &quot;Prog.&quot;

In 2006, the American reggae band the Easy Star All-Stars released &quot;Radiodread&quot;, a reggae interpretation of &quot;OK Computer&quot;. In 2007, the music blog &quot;Stereogum&quot; released &quot;OKX: A Tribute to OK Computer&quot;, with covers by artists including Vampire Weekend.

==Reissues and compilations==
Radiohead&#x27;s record contract with EMI, the parent company of Parlophone, ended in 2003. EMI retained the rights to Radiohead&#x27;s material recorded under their contract, including &quot;OK Computer&quot;. In 2007, EMI released &quot;Radiohead Box Set&quot;, a compilation of albums recorded while Radiohead were signed to EMI. On 19 August 2008, EMI reissued &quot;OK Computer&quot; as a double LP as part of the &quot;From the Capitol Vaults&quot; series, along with other Radiohead albums. It became the tenth-bestselling vinyl record of 2008, selling almost 10,000 copies. The reissue was connected in the press to the resurgence of interest in vinyl in the early 21st century.
===2009 &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; reissue===
On 24 March 2009, EMI reissued &quot;OK Computer&quot; as an expanded &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, alongside &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot;, without Radiohead&#x27;s involvement. The reissue was released in a 2-CD edition and an expanded 2-CD, 1-DVD edition. The first disc contains the original album, the second disc contains B-sides collected from &quot;OK Computer&quot; singles and live recording sessions, and the DVD contains a collection of music videos and a live television performance. All the material had been previously released and the music was not remastered. 

AllMusic, &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot; and &quot;PopMatters&quot; praised the supplemental material, but with reservations. Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; awarded the reissue a perfect score, arguing that it was worth buying for fans who did not already own the extra material. Plagenhoef said: &quot;That the band had nothing to do with these is beside the point: this is the final word on these records, if for no other reason that the Beatles&#x27; September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; writer Josh Modell praised the bonus disc and DVD, and said &quot;OK Computer&quot; was &quot;the perfect synthesis of Radiohead&#x27;s seemingly conflicted impulses&quot;.

=== XL reissues ===
In April 2016, XL Recordings acquired Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue. The EMI reissues, released without Radiohead&#x27;s approval, were removed from streaming services. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead&#x27;s back catalogue on vinyl, including &quot;OK Computer&quot;.

On 23 June 2017, Radiohead released a 20th-anniversary &quot;OK Computer&quot; reissue, &quot;OKNOTOK 1997 2017,&quot; on XL. It includes a remastered version of the album, plus eight B-sides and three previously unreleased tracks: &quot;I Promise&quot;, &quot;Man of War&quot; and &quot;Lift&quot;. The special edition includes books of artwork and notes and an audio cassette of demos and session recordings, including previously unreleased songs. &quot;OKNOTOK&quot; debuted at number two on the UK Album Chart, boosted by Radiohead&#x27;s third headline performance at Glastonbury Festival. It was the best-selling album in independent UK record shops for a year.

===&quot;MiniDiscs [Hacked]&quot;===

In early June 2019, nearly 18 hours of demos, outtakes and other material recorded during the &quot;OK Computer&quot; period leaked online. On 11 June, Radiohead made the archive available to stream or purchase from the music sharing site Bandcamp for 18 days, with proceeds going to the environmental advocacy group Extinction Rebellion.

<text>Anne Patricia Carson (born June 21, 1950) is a Canadian poet, essayist, translator, classicist, and professor.

Trained at the University of Toronto, Carson has taught classics, comparative literature, and creative writing at universities across the United States and Canada since 1979, including McGill, Michigan, NYU, and Princeton.

With more than twenty books of writings and translations published to date, Carson was awarded Guggenheim and MacArthur Fellowships, has won the Lannan Literary Award, two Griffin Poetry Prizes, the T. S. Eliot Prize, the Princess of Asturias Award, the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language poetry, and the PEN/Nabokov Award, and was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 2005 for her contribution to Canadian letters.

==Early life and education==
Anne Carson was born in Toronto on June 21, 1950. Her father was a banker and she grew up in a number of small Canadian towns. In high school, a Latin instructor introduced Carson to the world and language of Ancient Greece and tutored her privately. Enrolling at St. Michael&#x27;s College at the University of Toronto, she left twice—at the end of her first and second years. Carson, disconcerted by curricular constraints (particularly by a required course on Milton), retired to the world of graphic arts for a short time. She did eventually return to the University of Toronto where she completed her Bachelor of Arts in 1974, her Master of Arts in 1975, and her Ph.D. in 1981. She also spent a year studying Greek metrics and Greek textual criticism at the University of St Andrews.

== Writing ==
Trained as a classicist, and with an interest in comparative literature, anthropology, history, and the arts, Carson fuses ideas and themes from many fields in her writing. She frequently references, modernises, and translates Ancient Greek and Latin literature – writers such as Aeschylus, Catullus, Euripides, Homer, Ibycus, Mimnermus, Sappho, Simonides, Sophocles, Stesichorus, and Thucydides. She is also influenced by, and references more modern writers and thinkers, such as Emily Brontë, Paul Celan, Emily Dickinson, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Hölderlin, Franz Kafka, John Keats, Gertrude Stein, Simone Weil, and Virginia Woolf. Many of her books blend the forms of poetry, essay, prose, criticism, translation, dramatic dialogue, fiction, and non-fiction to varying degrees.

First editions of Carson&#x27;s eighteen books of writings (as of 2021) have been published by Alfred A.

&quot;Eros the Bittersweet&quot; – Carson&#x27;s first book of criticism, published in 1986 – examines eros as a simultaneous experience of pleasure and pain best exemplified by &quot;glukupikron&quot;, a word of Sappho&#x27;s creation and the &quot;bittersweet&quot; of the book&#x27;s title. It considers how triangulations of desire appear in the writings of Sappho, ancient Greek novelists, and Plato. A reworking of her 1981 doctoral thesis &quot;Odi et Amo Ergo Sum&quot; (&quot;I Hate and I Love, Therefore I Am&quot;), &quot;Eros the Bittersweet&quot; &quot;laid the groundwork for her subsequent publications, […] formulating the ideas on desire that would come to dominate her poetic output&quot;, and establishing her &quot;style of patterning her writings after classical Greek literature&quot;.

&quot;Men in the Off Hours&quot; (2000) is a hybrid collection of short poems, verse essays, epitaphs, commemorative prose, interviews, scripts, and translations from ancient Greek and Latin (of Alcman, Catullus, Sappho and others). The book broke with Carson&#x27;s established pattern of writing long poems. The pieces include diverse references to writers, thinkers, and artists, as well as to historical, biblical, and mythological figures, including: Anna Akhmatova, Antigone, Antonin Artaud, John James Audubon, Augustine, Bei Dao, Catherine Deneuve, Emily Dickinson, Tamiki Hara, Hokusai, Edward Hopper, Longinus (both biblical and literary), Thucydides, Leo Tolstoy, and Virginia Woolf.

Carson delivered a series of &quot;short talks&quot;, or short-format poems on various subjects, at the address to the University of Toronto Ph.D. graduating class of 2012. She also participated in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s project &quot;Sixty Six Books&quot; in 2011, writing a piece titled &quot;Jude: The Goat at Midnight&quot; based on the Epistle of Jude from the King James Bible.

=== Reception ===
Carson&#x27;s first book of poetry – 1984&#x27;s &quot;Canicula di Anna&quot; – garnered her first literary prize: the &quot;Quarterly Review of Literature&quot; Betty Colladay Award. Acclaim for her first book of essays, &quot;Eros the Bittersweet&quot;, grew in the fifteen years after it was published in 1986: the book &quot;first stunned the classics community as a work of Greek scholarship; then it stunned the nonfiction community as an inspired return to the lyrically based essays once produced by Seneca, Montaigne, and Emerson; and then, and only then, deep into the 1990s, reissued as &#x27;literature&#x27; and redesigned for an entirely new audience, it finally stunned the poets.&quot; By the turn of the millennium, &quot;Eros the Bittersweet&quot; had also entered into the popular consciousness, voted onto the 1999 Modern Library Reader&#x27;s List for the 100 Best Nonfiction books of the 20th century, and mentioned (along with &quot;Autobiography of Red&quot;) in a 2004 episode of the television series &quot;The L Word&quot;.

Early recognition for her work also came from the Quebec Writers&#x27; Federation Awards (known as &quot;QSPELL&quot; until 1998), which shortlisted Carson for &quot;Short Talks&quot; in 1993 before going on to award her the honour three times between 1996 and 2001 (for &quot;Glass, Irony, and God&quot;, &quot;Autobiography of Red&quot;, and &quot;The Beauty of the Husband&quot;). Carson&#x27;s early publications saw her shortlisted for the 1994 Journey Prize for &quot;Water Margins&quot;, and brought her the 1996 Lannan Literary Award for Poetry, and the 1997 Pushcart Prize for her poem &quot;Jaget&quot;. In 1997, Carson was awarded a Rockefeller Bellagio Center Fellowship, followed by a Guggenheim Fellowship for Poetry in 1998, and a MacArthur Fellowship (commonly known as the &quot;Genius Grant&quot;) in 2000.

The National Book Critics Circle Award shortlisted Carson three times (for &quot;Autobiography of Red&quot; in 1998, &quot;Men in the Off Hours&quot; in 2000, and &quot;Nox&quot; in 2010), making her and Alice Munro the first two non-Americans to be nominated after the Award went global in 1998. She was also shortlisted for the Forward Prize in 1998 for &quot;Glass and God&quot;, her first book of poetry published in the UK. Shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize four times between 1999 and 2013, Carson won for &quot;The Beauty of the Husband&quot; in 2001 (her third consecutive nomination), making her the first woman to be awarded this honour. Carson was the first poet to be awarded the Griffin Poetry Prize (for &quot;Men in the Off Hours&quot; in 2001), and the first to win the prize for a second time (for &quot;Red Doc&gt;&quot; in 2013). She was also a judge for the 2010 Griffin Poetry Prize.

Carson was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 2005, the announcement describing her as &quot;a singular voice in the literature of our country&quot;. She was awarded an honorary degree by her alma mater, the University of Toronto, in 2012. She also received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters in 2014 from the University of St Andrews, where she studied for a diploma with Kenneth Dover in 1975–1976.

In 2018, Carson was longlisted for the one-time New Academy Prize in Literature, established as an alternative to the postponed 2018 Nobel Prize. In 2020, she was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award for Literature, with the jury noting that she &quot;has attained levels of intensity and intellectual standing that place her among the most outstanding of present-day writers&quot;. In 2021, Carson won the PEN/Nabokov Award for Achievement in International Literature, honouring a body of work marked by &quot;enduring originality and consummate craftsmanship&quot;, and received the 2020 Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language poetry for &quot;Norma Jeane Baker of Troy&quot;, an award she was first shortlisted for in 2001 (for &quot;Men in the Off Hours&quot;). Her 2024 book, &quot;Wrong Norma&quot;, was longlisted for the National Book Award for Poetry.

Carson has also been the subject of two edited volumes: &quot;Anne Carson: Ecstatic Lyre&quot;, edited by Joshua Marie Wilkinson and published by the University of Michigan Press in 2015, which is dedicated to the breadth of her works; and &quot;Anne Carson/ Antiquity&quot; (sic), edited by Laura Jansen and published by Bloomsbury in 2021, which examines Carson&#x27;s classicism as it emerges in her poetry, translations, essays, and visual artistry. In 2023, &quot;Anne Carson: The Glass Essayist&quot;, a critical monograph on Carson&#x27;s work by Elizabeth Sarah Coles, was published by Oxford University Press. The book was awarded the Poetry Foundation&#x27;s Pegasus Award for Poetry Criticism in 2024.

In recent years, Carson has been regarded as a likely candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, alongside such writers as Margaret Atwood, Maryse Condé, Haruki Murakami, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, and Can Xue.

== Translation ==
Carson has published translations of ten ancient Greek tragedies – one by Aeschylus (&quot;Agamemnon&quot;), two by Sophocles (&quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Electra&quot;), and seven by Euripides (&quot;Alcestis&quot;, &quot;Hecuba&quot;, &quot;Herakles&quot;, &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;, &quot;Orestes&quot;, and &quot;The Bacchae&quot;) – as well as the poetry of Sappho in English.

First editions of Carson&#x27;s seven books of translations have been published by Alfred A. Knopf, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, the New York Review of Books, and the University of Chicago Press in the US, and by Oberon Books and the Oxford University Press in the UK.

Carson was a Rockefeller Scholar-in-Residence at the 92nd Street Y (New York City) from August 1986 to August 1987, where she worked on a translation of Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Electra&quot;. It was eventually published in 2001 and included in her 2009 book &quot;An Oresteia&quot;, which won the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation in 2010. Featuring Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Electra&quot;, and Euripides&#x27; &quot;Orestes&quot;, &quot;An Oresteia&quot; was staged in New York by the Classic Stage Company in 2009.

Carson was also an Anna-Maria Kellen Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin in 2007, where she worked on a translation of the ancient Greek play &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (attributed to Aeschylus), an excerpt of which was published in 2010.

In 2015, a production of Carson&#x27;s &quot;Antigone&quot; directed by Ivo van Hove and starring Juliette Binoche opened at Les Théâtres de la Ville de Luxembourg in 2015 before travelling to cities in Europe and the US, including London (Barbican Centre), New York (BAM), and Paris (Théâtre de la Ville).

== Teaching ==
Carson began her Classics teaching career at the University of Calgary in 1979, before completing her Ph.D. at the University of Toronto. In 1980, she joined Princeton University, where she taught as instructor, and later assistant professor. She also taught at the 92nd Street Y in New York during her time there as a Rockefeller Scholar in Residence (1986–1987). Failing to make tenure, Carson left Princeton in 1987 to teach classical languages and literature at Emory University in Atlanta for a year, before moving to Montreal to join McGill University as Director of Graduate Studies in Classics.

In the late 1990s, Carson&#x27;s teaching career hit a hurdle when McGill cancelled all graduate courses in ancient Greek, closed its Classics Department, and moved all remaining Classics courses to its History Department. While continuing to teach at McGill as associate professor, Carson dealt with this by spending half of each year as a guest lecturer at other institutions, including the University of Michigan (Norman Freehling Visiting Professorship, 1999–2000), the University of California, Berkeley (Spring 2000), and the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland (Spring 2001). She was appointed John MacNaughton Professor of Classics at McGill in 2000.

Carson moved to Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan in 2003, where she served as Professor of Classical Studies, Comparative Literature, and English Language and Literature until 2009. In 2004, Carson was in contention for the Professor of Poetry Chair at the University of Oxford, placing second behind the eventual appointment Christopher Ricks, with around 30 nominations. She was cited as a potential contender for the four-year position again in 2009.

Carson joined the New York University Creative Writing Program as Distinguished Poet-in-Residence and Visiting Professor in 2009. Together with her husband and collaborator Robert Currie, she teaches an annual class at NYU on the art of collaboration, called &quot;Egocircus&quot;. Carson was an Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University from 2010 to 2016, and the Mohr Visiting Poet at Stanford University (Creative Writing Program) in 2013. She joined Bard College as Visiting Distinguished Writer-in-Residence in 2014, teaching classical studies and the written arts. Carson has described her more diverse role in the latter part of her career as &quot;a visiting [whatever]&quot;, and her decades spent teaching ancient Greek as &quot;a total joy&quot;.

== Honours ==
Carson was elected a Royal Society of Literature International Writer in 2022. In May 2023, she was announced as Honorary President of the Classical Association, 2023–24. She was awarded the international Vigdís Prize, an award conferred for outstanding contributions to world languages and cultures.

== Personal life ==
Carson is known to be reticent about her private life, and discourages autobiographical readings of her writings. Information about her in publications is often limited to the phrase: &quot;Anne Carson was born in Canada and teaches ancient Greek for a living.&quot; While not a confessional poet, her work is considered personal. Carson has said that in her work, she uses her life democratically as just one set of facts among others in the world.

Carson&#x27;s first marriage, during which she used the surname Giacomelli, lasted eight years and ended in 1980. This union, and its aftermath, has been claimed as a source for &quot;Kinds of Water&quot; (collected in &quot;Plainwater&quot;), and for &quot;The Beauty of the Husband&quot;. Carson has confirmed that her first husband took her notebooks when they divorced (as happens to the protagonist in &quot;The Beauty of the Husband&quot;), though later returned them.

Carson&#x27;s father Robert had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. &quot;The Glass Essay&quot; (collected in &quot;Glass, Irony, and God&quot;), &quot;Very Narrow&quot; (collected in &quot;Plainwater&quot;), and &quot;Father&#x27;s Old Blue Cardigan&quot; (collected in &quot;Men in the Off Hours&quot;) all deal with his mental and physical decline.

Carson&#x27;s mother Margaret (1913–1997) died during the writing of &quot;Men in the Off Hours&quot;. Carson closed the collection with the prose piece &quot;Appendix to Ordinary Time&quot;, using crossed-out phrases from the diaries and manuscripts of Virginia Woolf to craft an epitaph for her. &quot;Red Doc&gt;&quot; has been read as a second elegy for the death of her mother. Carson has described her mother as the love of her life.

Carson&#x27;s brother Michael was arrested for drug dealing in 1978. Jumping bail, he fled Canada and she never saw him again. Carson dealt with the disappearance of her brother from her life in &quot;Water Margins: An Essay on Swimming by My Brother&quot; (collected in &quot;Plainwater&quot;), which is written as a kind of memoir. In 2000, he called her and they arranged to meet in Copenhagen where he lived, but he died before they could reconnect. &quot;Nox&quot;, an epitaph Carson created for her brother in 2000 and published in 2010, has been described as her most explicitly personal work.

Carson is married to the artist Robert Currie, whom she met in Ann Arbor while teaching at the University of Michigan. She has described Currie as &quot;my collaborator-husband person&quot;. Projects they have worked on together include book designs and performances for &quot;Nox&quot; and &quot;Antigonick&quot;. Carson also refers to Currie as &quot;the Randomizer&quot; during their creative process.

On April 19, 2022, Carson and Currie were granted Icelandic citizenship.

In an article in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; in August 2024, Carson revealed that she had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>Seydou Koné (; born January 1, 1953, in Dimbokro), better known by his stage name Alpha Blondy, is an Ivorian reggae singer and international recording artist. Many of his songs are politically and socially motivated, and are mainly sung in his native language Dyula, French and English, though he occasionally uses other languages, for example, Arabic or Hebrew.

==Early years==

===Childhood===
The first son of a family of eight children, Seydou Koné was raised by his grandmother in an environment described by him as &quot;among elders&quot;, which was to have a big impact on his career. In 1962, Alpha Blondy joined his father in Odienné, where he spent ten years, attended Sainte Elisabeth High School, and was involved in the Ivory Coast students movement. He formed a band in high school, but this affected his schooling and he was expelled for poor attendance. His parents sent him to study English in Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia, in 1973. He spent thirteen months there and then moved to the United States to improve his English.

===College in the United States===
In 1974, Seydou moved to New York where he majored in English at Hunter College and the Columbia University American Language Program, pursuing a career in teaching. In New York, he was introduced to Rastafari and attended concerts by Jamaican artists including Burning Spear. Seydou was involved in multiple altercations before returning to the Ivory Coast where he encountered further trouble until he reunited with his childhood friend, Fulgence Kassi, who had become a noted television producer. This was the beginning of his career as a musician, and he adopted the alias &quot;Alpha Blondy&quot;.

==Musical career==

After various TV shows for Kassi, Blondy recorded his first solo album in 1982, entitled &quot;Jah Glory&quot;. This album was to have enormous success and would become later a symbol of resistance because of the song &quot;Brigadier Sabari,&quot; which documents his experience of being arrested in Abidjan in the 1980s and his subsequent mistreatment by the police. Alpha Blondy became a big star in Abidjan with his African twist of Reggae music, becoming in the eyes of his fans &quot;the Bob Marley of Africa&quot;. Alpha Blondy is spiritual, political and positive just like Marley himself, and recorded a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s song &quot;War&quot;. In order to reach more people with his message, he chose to sing in many languages: English; French; Baoulé, and his native language – Dioula. Later, he also brought new instrumentation to his brand of reggae such as the violin and cello.

Soon, the fame of Alpha Blondy spread to Europe. Following the success of an EP entitled &quot;Rasta Poué&quot;, he went to Paris in 1984 to make his second album, &quot;Cocody Rock&quot;, with the label Pathe Marconi. Blondy travelled to the island of Jamaica and recorded the title track of this album with Marley&#x27;s backing group, The Wailers.

Back home in 1985, Blondy went into the studio to record &quot;Apartheid Is Nazism&quot;; the title song was a call for the end of apartheid. In 1986, he recorded “Jerusalem” at Tuff Gong studios in Jamaica, again with The Wailers featuring legendary Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett. Blondy tried to promote unity between the religion of Islam, Judaism and Christianity. He drew his arguments and inspiration from his own diverse knowledge of the Bible, the Quran, and the Torah. That same year, he sang in Hebrew during a concert in Morocco. At this point, he was continuously touring. His new album &quot;Revolution&quot; had a lighter, gentler sound; this album featured cellos in the instrumentation, and the line-up included veteran Ivory Coast singer Aicha Kone. The album also included &quot;Jah Houphouët parle&quot;, a long speech by Ivory Coast president Félix Houphouët-Boigny with only the most minimal beat behind it.

Blondy spent the years 1987–89 giving concerts and recording &quot;SOS Guerre Tribale&quot; in Abidjan. This was promoted by Blondy himself, as he was distancing himself from Pathe Marconi at this stage. This was not to be a real success but it did not deter Blondy and in 1991 he returned to Europe for a concert tour and to record his famous album &quot;Masada&quot; with the help of musical legends such as Bocana Maiga and UK reggae producer Dennis Bovell. The album, with its hit single &quot;Rendez Vous&quot;, was a huge success, and Blondy was later to receive his first Gold Disc in Paris.

At the beginning of 1993, worn out from a world tour, Blondy succumbed to depression and was taken into an institution for psychiatric help. But as his health recovered he recorded the album &quot;Dieu&quot; (&quot;God&quot;), on which he appears more spiritual and religious, on tracks such as &quot;Heal Me&quot;, about his illness and recovery.

Blondy&#x27;s psychiatric treatment continued but on 10 December 1994, he was back with the festival in memory of President Houphouet, and later he made his European comeback at a storming concert at Le Zenith in Paris. In 1996, Blondy released a hits compilation and went back into the studio to record the album &quot;Grand Bassam Zion&quot;, singing in six languages: Malinke; Arabic; French; English; Ashanti and Wolof.

After two more years in Paris, Blondy returned to his homeland in 1998, with a new album, &quot;The Prophet&quot;. Convinced his label was too focused on the international market, he decided to create his own label. Since then he has recorded albums and singles, such as &quot;Yitzhak Rabin&quot;, in memory of the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated in 1995 (this was accompanied by a grueling tour of Europe), the single &quot;Journaliste en Danger&quot; from his 2000 album &quot;Elohim&quot;.

Alpha Blondy celebrated 20 years as a recording artist with the 2002 release of CD &quot;MERCI&quot;, featuring Ophelie Winter and Saian Supa Crew, which earned him a 2003 Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Reggae Album&quot;. However, due to the political situation in Ivory Coast, he was unable to personally attend the award ceremony in New York City. In an unprecedented move, the Grammy Awards permitted him to send a representative in his place of honour.

In 2005 &quot;Akwaba&quot; was released.
His CD &quot;Jah Victory&quot; was released July 2007. It features Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare, as well as Tyrone Downie formerly of Bob Marley and the Wailers. &quot;Victory&quot; is in honor of the peace agreement that was reached and implemented in the Ivory Coast in March 2007. 

One of Blondy&#x27;s most popular and successful songs was &quot;Sébé Allah Y&#x27;é&quot;.

On 19 July 2009, Blondy performed at New York&#x27;s Central Park before a crowd of many native Africans, Jamaicans, and Americans.

On 13 June 2010, a large crowd was allowed into a Blondy concert in the Ivory Coast to celebrate the peace and unity of the country. Overcrowded conditions at the concert resulted in at least 20 people being injured, two of whom died.

On 27 June 2010, Alpha Blondy was the closing act at Parkpop, The Hague, Netherlands. He replaced Snoop Dogg and Beenie Man.

Blondy has also been an important influence on other African reggae artists such as Ismaël Isaac.

In November 2014 singer/songwriter Jonathan Wilson released an EP called &quot;Slide By&quot; featuring the song &quot;Alpha Blondy Was King&quot;.

Released in January 2015, the Roots Reggae Library featured an edition on Alpha Blondy with interpretations and translations of songs in all languages, including those in Dioula.

In February 2023, Blondy Performed in front of home crowd at the Alassane Ouattara Stadium in Abidjan for the closing ceremony of the 2023 African Cup of Nations. Blondy performed two songs, Sebe Allah Ye and his anthem, Cocody Rock.

== Faith ==
Alpha Blondy was born to a Muslim father and a Christian mother, and was brought up by a grandmother &quot;who taught him to love everyone&quot;. Blondy&#x27;s respect for all religions and the spirituality he derives from them can be heard on the tracks “God is One” or “Jerusalem” where he sang for unity among all religions in 1986.

== Humanitarian ==
In 2005, Alpha Blondy was named United Nations Ambassador of Peace for Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. He made great efforts to bring about a peaceful solution to his country&#x27;s political and physical division which was a result of an attempted coup in 2001. As of March 2007 a peace agreement was signed and implemented, due to the hard work of many people including Alpha Blondy. Alpha now reaches out further with the newly created not-for-profit, non-government, non-political, charitable foundation, Alpha Blondy Jah Glory Foundation, which works towards ending social injustice and generational poverty by giving people the tools that they need to help themselves. He strongly believes in helping the poor (Jah Glory), and also that children should not be hurt. The Foundation strives to create and implement grassroots programs at the village level, such as the Women&#x27;s Self-Sufficiency Micro Loan Program, to teach women who are caring for multiple orphans how to start and manage their own business, to better provide for their families, as well as other sustainable projects, such as the Tafari-Genesis Retreat Camp for Children (Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso). It especially hopes to bring joy and hope to children who have been affected by civil wars, former child soldiers, and those who suffer from chronic life-threatening illnesses, such as sickle-cell anemia, malaria, asthma, etc.

Alpha Blondy continues to fight for peace and unity all around the world through music. A recent example is his single “Who Are You” with Ophélie Winter against antipersonnel mines. He has also participated at many humanitarian and charity concerts, such as the concert in Senegal in March 2006 for the eradication of Malaria in Africa (where he appeared along with many other celebrities). He also continues this work in Ivory Coast itself, at his annual free concert at Bassam beach called “festa”.

In 2014, he sang &quot;On n&#x27;oublie pas&quot; (written by Serge Bilé) with several artists and personalities including Jocelyne Béroard, Harry Roselmack and Admiral T. This song is a tribute to the 152 victims from Martinique of the crash of 16 August 2005, to remember this event and to help the AVCA, the association of the victims of the air disaster, to raise funds.

<text>Penthilus (; Ancient Greek: Πένθιλος) is the illegitimate or legitimate son of half-siblings Orestes and Erigone in Greek mythology. 

== Family ==
Penthilus&#x27; grandmother was Clytemnestra. His maternal and paternal grandfathers were Aigisthos and Agamemnon respectively. Penthilus fathered two sons, Echelatus (Echelas or Archelaüs), and Damasias (Damasius), father of Agorius.

== Mythology ==
Orestes killed both Clytemnestra, who was his own mother and Aigisthos. Erigone is said to have hanged herself or married Orestes after the latter&#x27;s first wife, Hermione, died. Orestes was ruler over much of the Peloponnese and died of a snakebite at age 70. One story says that as a child, Penthilus was torn apart and devoured by wolves in the Taygetus mountains, near Sparta. His father established a festival of mourning, the so-called Penthilia in his honour.

According to Pausanias, Penthilus grew up and founded a city either on Lesbos or in Thrace. Penthilus was the mythical ancestor of the Penthilides, an ancient dynasty of kings on Lesbos. His son, Echelas was the father of Gras, the founder of the city Aeolis, between Ionia and Mysia. In some accounts, Penthilus instead led a colony of Aeolians to Thrace.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Periclymenus (; Ancient Greek: Περικλύμενος &quot;Periklymenos&quot;) may refer to:

*Periclymenus, a Pylian prince as the son of King Neleus and Chloris. He was one of the Argonauts. His grandfather, Poseidon gave him the ability to shapeshift into various animals. He was killed by Herakles at Pylos, although he tried to escape in the form of an eagle. He was the father of Penthilos or by Pisidice, of Borus, the father of Penthilus.
*Periclymenus, a defender of Thebes in the war of the Seven against Thebes, and would-be killer of Amphiaraus. He was the son of Poseidon and Chloris, daughter of Tiresias of Thebes. Amphiaraus was swallowed by the earth before Periclymenus could kill him though. It was either this Periclymenus or Asphodicus that killed Parthenopaeus.
*Periclymenus, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Zacynthus along with other 43 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was killed by Odysseus with the aid of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*Periclymenus or simply Clymenus, father of Erginus who was usually conflated with another Erginus, one of the Argonauts.

<doc id="84652" wikidata="Q3699699" url="?curid=84652" title="Hubbert curve">
<text>The Hubbert curve is an approximation of the production rate of a resource over time. It is a symmetric logistic distribution curve, often confused with the &quot;normal&quot; gaussian function. It first appeared in &quot;Nuclear Energy and the Fossil Fuels,&quot; geologist M. King Hubbert&#x27;s 1956 presentation to the American Petroleum Institute, as an idealized symmetric curve, during his tenure at the Shell Oil Company. It has gained a high degree of popularity in the scientific community for predicting the depletion of various natural resources. The curve is the main component of Hubbert peak theory, which has led to the rise of peak oil concerns. Basing his calculations on the peak of oil well discovery in 1948, Hubbert used his model in 1956 to create a curve which predicted that oil production in the contiguous United States would peak around 1970.

==Shape==

The prototypical Hubbert curve is a probability density function of a logistic distribution curve. It is not a gaussian function (which is used to plot normal distributions), but the two have a similar appearance. The density of a Hubbert curve approaches zero more slowly than a gaussian function:

:formula_1

The graph of a Hubbert curve consists of three key elements: 
# a gradual rise from zero resource production that then increases quickly
# a &quot;Hubbert peak&quot;, representing the maximum production level
# a drop from the peak that then follows a steep production decline.

The actual shape of a graph of real world production trends is determined by various factors, such as development of enhanced production techniques, availability of competing resources, and government regulations on production or consumption. Because of such factors, real world Hubbert curves are often not symmetrical.

==Application==

=== Peak oil ===

Using the curve, Hubbert modeled the rate of petroleum production for several regions, determined by the rate of new oil well discovery, and extrapolated a world production curve. The relative steepness of decline in this projection is the main concern in peak oil discussions. This is because a steep drop in the production implies that global oil production will decline so rapidly that the world will not have enough time to develop sources of energy to replace the energy now used from oil, possibly leading to drastic social and economic impacts.

===Other resources===

Hubbert models have been used to predict the production trends of various resources, such as natural gas (Hubbert&#x27;s attempt in the late 1970s resulted in an inaccurate prediction that natural gas production would fall dramatically in the 1980s), Coal, fissionable materials, Helium, transition metals (such as copper), and water. At least one researcher has attempted to create a Hubbert curve for the whaling industry and caviar, while another applied it to cod.

=== Critique ===
After the predicted early-1970s peak of oil production in the U.S., production declined over the following 35 years in a pattern closely matching the Hubbert curve. However, new extraction methods began reversing this trend beginning in the mid-2000s decade, with production reaching 10.07 million b/d in November 2017 – the highest monthly level of crude oil production in U.S. history. As such, the Hubbert curve has to be calculated separately for different oil provinces, whose exploration has started at a different time, and oil extracted by new techniques, sometimes called unconventional oil, resulting in individual Hubbert cycles. The Hubbert Curve for US oil production is generally measured in years.

<text>The are a social grouping of Japanese people descended from members of the feudal class associated with , mainly those with occupations related to death such as executioners, gravediggers, slaughterhouse workers, butchers, and tanners. Burakumin are physically indistinguishable from other Japanese but have historically been regarded as a socially distinct group. When identified, they are often subject to discrimination and prejudice. , there were an estimated 3 million &quot;burakumin&quot; living in the country, mostly in western Japan.

During Japan&#x27;s feudal era, these occupations acquired a hereditary status of oppression, and later became a formal class within the class system of the Edo period (1603–1868). The stratum immediately below merchants comprised the &quot;hinin&quot; (literally &quot;non-persons&quot;), and below them the &quot;eta&quot; (&quot;great filth&quot;), who were together known as the &quot;senmin&quot; (&quot;base people&quot;). They were subject to various legal restrictions, such as being forced to live in separate villages or neighborhoods. In 1871, the new Meiji government legally abolished the feudal classes, but stigma against the former &quot;hinin&quot; and &quot;eta&quot; continued. The term came into use to refer to these people and their descendants. Some reports indicate that discrimination against burakumin in marriage and employment persists in certain regions. They are more likely to work a low-paying job, live in poverty, or be associated with the &quot;yakuza&quot;. A movement for &quot;burakumin&quot; rights began in the 1920s, and the Buraku Liberation League was founded in 1946; it has achieved some of its legal goals, including securing restrictions on third-party access to family registries. Notable &quot;burakumin&quot; include writer Kenji Nakagami and politician Hiromu Nonaka.

== Terminology ==
The term is derived from , a Japanese term which refers literally to a small, generally rural, commune or hamlet. In the regions of Japan where the issue is much less publicly prominent, such as Hokkaido and Okinawa, is still used in a non-pejorative sense to refer to any hamlet. Historically, the term was used for an outcast community that was discriminated against officially and formally.
A term used much for settlements is , an official term for districts designated for government and local authority assimilation projects from 1969 to 2002.

The social issue concerning &quot;discriminated communities&quot; is usually referred to as or, less commonly, .

During the feudal era, the outcastes were termed , a term now considered derogatory. towns were termed .

Some refer to their own communities as and themselves as .

Other outcaste groups from whom may have been descended included the . The definition of , as well as their social status and typical occupations varied over time, but typically included ex-convicts and vagrants who worked as town guards, street cleaners or entertainers.

During the 19th century, the term was invented to name the and because both classes were forced to live in separate village neighborhoods.

== Definition ==
Defining the as a separate group is difficult. parents sometimes do not tell their children about their ancestry in hopes of avoiding discrimination. Because of this, there is an increasingly large population that has no idea that others would consider them . Discrimination is primarily based on ancestry and location; someone with no ancestry may be viewed as one and discriminated against if they move to a former .

== Historical origins ==
The predecessors to , called or formed as a distinct group some time during the Heian period, AD 794–1185. The permeation of Buddhism into Japan in the first millennium led to the castigation of meat eating and similar activities. The Shinto and Buddhist cultures, which aimed for a certain purity of body and mind, considered working with dead animals, blood, or any sort of decaying object as polluting, and hence occupations like butchery and leather tanning were besmirched. The &quot;eta&quot;, people who held such occupations, dealt with pollution and were thus considered inferior or sub-human. However, because of their ability to deal with pollution, several myths emerged from the Heian through medieval periods about certain &#x27;s abilities to cleanse ritual pollution, and in some portrayals even possess magical powers. Another outcaste, the , were associated with the tanning industry, and had the exclusive rights to tan hides. Prior to the Edo period, these &quot;burakumin&quot; (peripatetic or settled) would live outside common population centers and maintained some socio-ethical significance, albeit negligible. They were also employed as mediators in disputes. Spatial and geographic markers played a significant role in the distinction between the &quot;burakumin&quot; and other members of society.

, meaning &#x27;non-human&#x27;, was another pre- status, applying to certain criminals, beggars and camp followers of samurai. Their position was more mobile, and they were usually thought to be less polluted. The Tokugawa shogunate regarded beggars as and allowed them to beg in designated areas. They had to work as restroom attendants, prison officers, or executioners.

Within the &quot;hinin&quot; and communities there would usually be a centralized chieftain who was given the exclusive license of tanning, candle wicks and other similar occupations, employing their peers and concentrating great wealth and local power. This chieftain took on the name of and was given the authority to supervise the &quot;hisabetsumin&quot; living in the hamlets located in the eight provinces of the Kanto region, the Izu Province, as well as in parts of Kai, Suruga, Mutsu and Mikawa Provinces.

=== Edo Period ===
In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa shogunate and began systematically curbing the autonomy of the feudal daimyo warlords whose struggles for dominance had defined the Sengoku period. By exerting control over strategically important daimyo and their fiefs, he centralized power and revitalized the position of Shogun as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Japan. His rule brought about the Edo period, which scholars characterize as the unification of Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate, citing neo-Confucian theory, ruled by dividing the people into four main categories. Older scholars believed that there were of &quot;samurai, peasants (&quot;hyakushō&quot;), craftsmen, and merchants&quot; (&quot;chōnin&quot;) under the daimyo, with 80% of peasants under the 5% samurai class, followed by craftsmen and merchants. However, various studies have revealed since about 1995 that the classes of peasants, craftsmen, and merchants under the samurai are equal, and the old hierarchy chart has been removed from Japanese history textbooks. In other words, peasants, craftsmen, and merchants are not a social pecking order, but a social classification. The &quot;burakumin&quot; held occupations associated with religious impurity, and were subsequently relegated as outcastes and subject to ostracization in the mainstream Japanese society. Among the members of the outcastes were the &quot;eta&quot; (hereditary outcastes), landless peasants and the &quot;hinin&quot;, which comprised people guilty of certain crimes and their offspring. As Japanese society stabilized, the demand for leather declined, as it was used largely for warring purposes, and along with the Tokugawa caste policy, the &quot;eta&quot; were relegated to the peripheries of villages or formed their own communities. The &quot;hinin&quot; were eventually forced to join in &quot;eta&quot; settlements (&quot;buraku&quot;). As the Edo period witnessed local prosperity, the shogunate augmented the differences between the four classes (even between the &quot;burakumin&quot; and the &quot;hinin&quot;), and often used the two outcaste groups as scapegoats. Various humiliating injunctions mandating certain dress codes or hairstyles for &quot;burakumin&quot; were passed, and by the 18th century, they were prohibited from entering temples, homes of common citizens and schools without permission. At this point, the &quot;burakumin&quot; were generally economically subsistent on the government&#x27;s purchase of the war equipment they produced, and they adopted occupations in the military as jailers, torturers and executioners.

== End of the feudal era ==

The feudal caste system in Japan ended formally in 1869 with the Meiji Restoration. In 1871, the newly formed Meiji government issued the decree, giving outcasts equal legal status. It is currently known better as the . However, were deprived of the exclusive rights of disposal of dead bodies of horses and cattle. The elimination of their monopolies of certain occupations actually resulted in a decrease of their general living standards, while social discrimination simply continued.

During the early Meiji era, many anti- riots () happened around the country. For example, in a village in Okayama when &quot;former &quot; tried to buy alcohol, four men were killed, four men were injured and 25 houses were destroyed by commoners. In another village, as part of an anti-Government riot, 263 houses were destroyed and 18 former s were killed.

The practice of eating meat existed even during the Edo period, but the official ban of the consumption of meat from livestock was ended in 1871 in order to &quot;Westernise&quot; the country. Many former began to work in abattoirs and as butchers, as they were thought to be experienced with the handling of dead bodies.

Slow-changing social attitudes, especially in the countryside, meant that abattoirs and their workers were often met with hostility from local residents. Continued ostracism, the decrease of living standards and the development of modern construction and city sprawl resulted in former communities becoming slum areas. Prejudice against the consumption of meat continued throughout the Meiji period. In 1872, a group of , who objected to the Emperor&#x27;s consumption of meat, tried to enter the Tokyo Imperial Palace and four of them were killed. They claimed that gods would leave Japan because the Japanese had eaten meat.

There were many terms used to indicate former outcastes, their communities or settlements at the time. Official documents referred to them as , while the newly liberated outcasts called themselves , among other terms.

Nakae Chōmin was a late 19th century statesman who worked for the liberation of . He transferred his resident registration to and denounced the discrimination against them when he campaigned during the election of 1890 from Osaka and won.

The term , now considered inappropriate, started being used by officials during the 1900s, and resulted in the meaning of the word (&#x27;hamlet&#x27;) coming to imply former villages in certain parts of Japan.

Attempts to resolve the problem during the early 20th century were of two types: the philosophy which encouraged improvements in living standards of communities and integration with the mainstream Japanese society, and the philosophy which concentrated on confronting and criticising alleged perpetrators of discrimination.

== Post-war situation ==
Although liberated legally during 1871 with the abolition of the feudal caste system, this did not end social discrimination against nor improve their living standards; until recently, Japanese family registration was fixed to an ancestral home address, which allowed people to deduce their ancestry.

=== Demographics ===
The number of asserted to be living in modern Japan varies from source to source. Japanese government statistics show the number of residents of assimilation districts who claim ancestry, whereas the Buraku Liberation League (BLL) figures are estimates of the total number of descendants of all former and current residents, including current residents without any ancestry.

A 1993 report by the Japanese government counted 4,533 throughout the country. Most were located in western Japan, while none were located in Hokkaido and Tōhoku. About three quarters of the districts are in rural areas. The size of each community ranged from less than five households to more than 1,000 households.

It is estimated that around 1,000 &quot;buraku&quot; communities chose not to register as , wanting to avoid the negative attention that could come from explicitly declaring themselves . BLL has extrapolated Meiji-era figures to arrive at an estimate of nearly three million . In some areas, are in a majority; per a 1997 report, they accounted for more than 70 percent of all residents of Yoshikawa (now Kōnan) in Kōchi Prefecture. In Ōtō, Fukuoka Prefecture, they accounted for more than 60 percent.

According to a survey performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government during 2003, 76% of Tokyo residents would not change their opinion of a close neighbor whom they discovered to be a ; 4.9% of respondents, on the other hand, would actively avoid a neighbor. There is still a social stigma for being a resident of certain areas associated traditionally with the , and some lingering discrimination in matters such as marriage and employment.

=== Discrimination in access to services ===
In many parts of the country, settlements built on the site of former villages ceased to exist by the 1960s because of either urban development or integration into mainstream society. However, in other regions, many of their residents continued to suffer from slum-like housing and infrastructure, lower economic status, illiteracy, and lower general educational standards.

In 1969, the government passed the to provide funding to these communities. Communities deemed to be in need of funding were designated for various , such as construction of new housing and community facilities such as health centers, libraries and swimming pools. The projects were terminated in 2002 with a total funding of an estimated 12 trillion yen over 33 years.

=== Social discrimination ===
Cases of social discrimination against residents of areas are still an issue in certain regions. Outside of the Kansai region, people in general are often not aware of the issues experienced by those of ancestry, and if they are, this awareness may only be awareness of the history of feudal Japan. Due to the sensitive nature of the topic and the campaigns by the Buraku Liberation League to remove any references in the media that may propagate discrimination against them, the issue is rarely discussed in the media.

Prejudice against most often manifests itself in the form of marriage discrimination and sometimes in employment. Traditionalist families have been known to check on the backgrounds of potential in-laws to identify people of ancestry. These checks are now illegal, and marriage discrimination is diminishing; Nadamoto Masahisa of the Buraku History Institute estimates that between 60 and 80% of marry a non-, whereas for people born during the late 1930s and early 1940s, the rate was 10%. Over the past decades, the number of marriages between and non- have increased, and opinion polls have shown a decrease in the number of Japanese willing to state they would discriminate against .

Many companies were known to have used lists of addresses that were developed first in 1975 to exclude the . The average income of a family was significantly less than the national average (60% in 1992).

Cases of continuing social discrimination are known to occur mainly in western Japan, particularly in the Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, and Hiroshima regions, where many people, especially the older generation, stereotype residents (whatever their ancestry) and associate them with squalor, unemployment and criminality.

No communities were identified in the following prefectures: Hokkaido, Aomori, Iwate, Miyagi, Akita, Yamagata, Fukushima, Tokyo, Toyama, Ishikawa, and Okinawa.

=== Yakuza membership ===
According to David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro in &quot;Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan&#x27;s Criminal Underworld&quot; (1986), account for about 70% of the members of the Yamaguchi-gumi, the largest yakuza crime syndicate in Japan.

Mitsuhiro Suganuma, an ex-member of the Public Security Intelligence Agency, testified in 2006 that account for about 60 percent of yakuza.

== rights movement ==
As early as 1922, officials of the organized a campaign, the , to advance their rights. The Declaration of the encouraged the to unite in resistance to discrimination, and sought to create a positive identity for the victims of discrimination, insisting that the time had come to be &quot;proud of being &quot;. The declaration portrayed the ancestors as &quot;manly martyrs of industry&quot; and argued that to submit meekly to oppression would be to insult and profane these ancestors. Despite internal divisions among anarchist, Bolshevik, and social democratic factions, and despite the Japanese government&#x27;s establishment of an alternate organization, the Yūma, designed to reduce the influence of the , the Levelers Association remained active until the late 1930s.

After World War II, the National Committee for Burakumin Liberation was initiated, changing its name to the during the 1950s. The league, with the endorsement of the socialist and communist parties, influenced the government into making important concessions during the late 1960s and 1970s.

During the 1960s, the Sayama Incident publicised the problems of the group. The incident involved the murder conviction of a member of the discriminated communities based on circumstantial evidence, which is generally given little weight against physical evidence in Japanese courts.

One concession was the passing of the Special Measures Law for Assimilation Projects, which provided financial aid for the discriminated communities. In 1976, legislation was also approved banning third parties from investigating another person&#x27;s family registry. This traditional system of registry, kept for all Japanese by the Ministry of Justice since the 19th century, would reveal an individual&#x27;s ancestry if consulted. By the new legislation, these records could now be consulted only for legal cases, making it more difficult to identify or discriminate against members of the group.

During the 1980s, some educators and local governments, particularly in areas with relatively large populations, began special education programs which they hoped would encourage greater educational and economic success for young members of the group and decrease the discrimination they faced. rights groups exist presently in all parts of Japan except for Hokkaidō and Okinawa.

 have been established across the country by prefectural governments and local authorities; these, in addition to promoting rights, campaign on behalf of a wide range of other groups such as women, the disabled, ethnic minorities, foreign residents and released prisoners. Even into the early 1990s, however, discussion of the &#x27;liberation&#x27; of these discriminated communities, or even their existence, was rare in public discussion.

=== Liberation League and the ===

The Buraku Liberation League is considered one of the most militant among &#x27;s rights groups. The BLL is known for its fierce &quot;denunciation and explanation sessions&quot;, where alleged perpetrators of discriminatory actions or speech are summoned for a public hearing before a panel of activists.

Early sessions were marked by occasions of violence and kidnapping, and several BLL activists have been arrested for such acts. The legality of these sessions is still disputed, but to this date the authorities have mostly ignored them except in the more extreme cases.

In 1990, Karel van Wolferen&#x27;s criticism of the BLL in his much-acclaimed book &quot;The Enigma of Japanese Power&quot; prompted the BLL to demand the publisher halt publication of the Japanese translation of the book. Van Wolferen condemned this as an international scandal.

The other major activist group is the , or , affiliated to the Japanese Communist Party (JCP). It was formed in 1979 by BLL activists who were either purged from the organization or abandoned it during the late 1960s, due to, among other things, their opposition to the decision that subsidies to the should be limited to the BLL members only. Not all were BLL members, and not all residents of the areas targeted for subsidies were historically descended from the outcastes.

The often disputed the BLL, accusing them of chauvinism. The conflict between the two organizations increased during 1974 when a clash between teachers belonging to a JCP-affiliated union and BLL activists at a high school in Yoka, rural Hyōgo Prefecture, put 29 in hospital.

In 1988, the BLL formed the International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism (IMADR). The BLL sought for the IMADR to be recognized as a United Nations Non-Government Organization, but in 1991, the informed the United Nations about the alleged human rights violations committed by the BLL in the course of their &quot;denunciation sessions&quot; held with accused &quot;discriminators&quot;.

According to a BLL-funded think tank, when cases of discrimination were alleged, the often conducted denunciation sessions as fierce as those of the BLL. Nonetheless, the IMADR was designated a UN human rights NGO in March 1993.

On March 3, 2004, the announced that &quot;the issue has basically been resolved&quot; and formally disbanded. On March 4, 2004, they began a new organization known as the or .

== Religion ==
Historically, they were followers of their own folk religion, and even in modern times, a significant portion of the burakumin population practices their own folk religion and ancestor worship. Today, most burakumin share common religious practices with the majority of Japanese citizens, following a unique mixture of Shinto and Buddhism, known as Shinbutsu-shūgō (神仏習合). They perform Shinto rituals at the birth of newborns. Historically, their funeral rituals were based on their own folk rites, and they buried their dead, unlike Buddhists. Many of them have also adopted Buddhism to escape social discrimination, as it offered religious advantages.

Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism originally patronized the lower castes. In 1922, when the National Levelers&#x27; Association () was initiated in Kyoto, Mankichi Saiko, a founder of the society and Jodo Shinshu priest, said, critiquing aggressive postures on the denouncement of acts of discrimination:

After many petitions from the BLL, in 1969 the &quot;Honganji&quot; changed its opinion on the issue. , which disassociated from the BLL in 1968, regrets this decision.

Religious discrimination against the was not recognized until the BLL&#x27;s criticism sessions became widespread. For example, in 1979 the Director-General of the Sōtō Sect of Buddhism made a speech at the &quot;3rd World Conference on Religion and Peace&quot; claiming that there was no discrimination against burakumin in Japan.

<doc id="84656" wikidata="Q207960" url="?curid=84656" title="Winsor McCay">
<text>Zenas Winsor McCay ( – July 26, 1934) was an American cartoonist and animator. He is best known for the comic strip &quot;Little Nemo&quot; (1905–1914; 1924–1927) and the animated film &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; (1914). For contractual reasons, he worked under the pen name Silas on the comic strip &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;.

From a young age, McCay was a quick, prolific, and technically dextrous artist. He started his professional career making posters and performing for dime museums, and in 1898 began illustrating newspapers and magazines. In 1903 he joined the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, where he created popular comic strips such as &quot;Little Sammy Sneeze&quot; and &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;. In 1905 his signature strip &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; debuted—a fantasy strip in an Art Nouveau style about a young boy and his adventurous dreams. The strip demonstrated McCay&#x27;s strong graphic sense and mastery of color and linear perspective. McCay experimented with the formal elements of the comic strip page, arranging and sizing panels to increase impact and enhance the narrative. McCay also produced numerous detailed editorial cartoons and was a popular performer of chalk talks on the vaudeville circuit.

McCay was an early animation pioneer; between 1911 and 1921 he self-financed and animated ten films, some of which survive only as fragments. The first three served in his vaudeville act; &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; was an interactive routine in which McCay appeared to give orders to a trained dinosaur. McCay and his assistants worked for twenty-two months on his most ambitious film, &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; (1918), a patriotic recreation of the German torpedoing in 1915 of the &quot;RMS Lusitania&quot;. &quot;Lusitania&quot; did not enjoy as much commercial success as the earlier films, and McCay&#x27;s later movies attracted little attention. His animation, vaudeville, and comic strip work was gradually curtailed as newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, his employer since 1911, expected McCay to devote his energies to editorial illustrations.

In his drawing, McCay made bold, prodigious use of linear perspective, particularly in detailed architecture and cityscapes. He textured his editorial cartoons with copious fine hatching, and made color a central element in &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. His comic strip work has influenced generations of cartoonists and illustrators. The technical level of McCay&#x27;s animation—its naturalism, smoothness, and scale—was unmatched until the work of Fleischer Studios in the late 1920s, followed by Walt Disney&#x27;s feature films in the 1930s. He pioneered inbetweening, the use of registration marks, cycling, and other animation techniques that were to become standard.

==Personal history==
===Family history===
McCay&#x27;s paternal grandparents, farmers Donald and Christiana , immigrated from Scotland to Upper Canada in the mid-1830s. McCay&#x27;s father, Robert (1840 – March 21, 1915) was born in Woodstock, Upper Canada, the third of six children. McCay&#x27;s maternal grandparents, Peter and Mary Murray, were also Scottish immigrants, and settled as farmers in East Zorra in Upper Canada. Their daughter Janet was the third of nine children.

Robert was a member of King Solomon&#x27;s No. 43 Masonic Lodge in Woodstock. In 1862, Robert first traveled to the U.S. Robert and the twenty-five-year-old Janet married on January 8, 1866, at Woodstock&#x27;s Methodist Episcopal Church. The couple moved across the Canada–United States border later in the year and settled in Spring Lake, Michigan, on the eastern coast of Lake Michigan. Robert was employed by American entrepreneur Zenas G. Winsor (1814–1890), with whom he had made contact in Canada.

Records of McCay&#x27;s birth are not extant. He stated in an interview in 1910 that he was born in 1869, and this is the year listed on his grave marker. in life, he told friends he was born September 26, 1871, in Spring Lake, and they published this information in a magazine. Michigan census records from 1870 and 1880 list a Zenas W. , who was born in Canada in 1867, and others have speculated 1866 or 1868 based on evidence on how the censuses were carried out. No Canadian birth record has been found, and a fire in Spring Lake in May 1893 could have destroyed any American birth record he may have had. His obituary in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; stated, &quot;not even Mr. McCay knew his exact age&quot;.

The McCays had two more children: Arthur in 1868, and Mae in 1876. Both were born in Michigan. Robert worked as a teamster under Winsor, and by May 1870 had saved enough money to buy a parcel of land. From 1879 to 1881, he worked as a retail grocer. In 1885 he moved the family to Stanton, Michigan, and expanded his land holdings; he was successful in real estate with his brother Hugh, who moved from in 1887.

By 1905, Robert was also a notary public. He had settled in Edmore, Michigan, and by this point had changed the spelling of his surname from &quot;McKay&quot; to &quot;McCay&quot;. His son related this story about the change:

===Early life===
McCay came to be known by his middle name, Winsor. His drawing skills emerged early. According to a story told within the family, McCay made his first drawing in the aftermath of one of the many fires that hit Spring Lake: he picked up a nail and etched the scene of the fire in the frost of a windowpane. Drawing became obsessive for him; he drew anything he saw, and the level of detail and accuracy in his drawing was noted at a young age. He was able to draw accurately from memory even things he had never before drawn—what McCay called &quot;memory sketching&quot;. His father thought little of his son&#x27;s artistic talents, though, and had him sent to Cleary Business College in Ypsilanti, Michigan. McCay rarely attended classes. He bragged about how he would catch the train to Detroit to show off his drawing skills at the Wonderland and Eden Musee dime museum. He drew portraits there for 25 apiece, of which he kept half.

McCay thrived on the attention he received, and his talents soon drew wider attention. John Goodison, a geography and drawing professor at Michigan State Normal School, offered to teach art to McCay privately, and McCay eagerly accepted. The lessons were practical and focused on using observation to learn to draw in geometrical perspective. Goodison, a former glass stainer, influenced McCay&#x27;s use of color. McCay learned how to draw quickly using drills on a blackboard, and gained an appreciation for master artists of the past.

===Early career (1889–1903)===
McCay spent two years in Chicago after making his way there sometime in 1889 with his friend Mort Touvers. He traded art techniques there with painter Jules Guérin, whom he met at a boarding house in which he lodged, and did artwork for posters and pamphlets at the National Printing and Engraving Company.

In 1891, McCay moved to Cincinnati, where he did more dime museum work while living in a boarding house near his workplace. He spent nine years making posters and other advertisements for the Kohl &amp; Middleton Dime Museum, and later Heck and Avery&#x27;s Family Theater (1896), Avery&#x27;s New Dime Museum (1898), and Will S. Heck&#x27;s Wonder World and Theater (1899) on Vine Street. At the museum in 1896, a demonstration of Thomas Edison&#x27;s Vitascope was given, which was likely McCay&#x27;s first exposure to the young medium of film. He also did work during this time for Ph. Morton&#x27;s printing and lithography company. McCay&#x27;s ability to draw quickly with great accuracy drew crowds when he painted advertisements in public.

His first year at Kohl &amp; Middleton, McCay was smitten when Maude Leonore Dufour walked into the dime museum with her sister while he was painting. He rushed to his studio to change into a custom-tailored suit, returned, and introduced himself to the fourteen-year-old Maude. Soon they eloped in Covington, Kentucky.

McCay began working on the side for the &quot;Cincinnati Commercial Tribune&quot;, where he learned to draw with a dip pen under the tutelage of &quot;Commercial Tribune&quot; art room manager Joseph Alexander. In 1898, he accepted a full-time position there. His many illustrations for the paper displayed his bold use of perspective and mastery of hatchwork. Soon after, he began freelancing for the humor magazine &quot;Life&quot; as well.

In 1900, McCay accepted a position with a higher salary at &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;. There, he produced a prolific number of drawings, did some reporting, and became head of the art department. In his drawings, he began using line thickness to indicate depth, and used thick lines to surround his characters in an Art Nouveau-inspired style that became a trademark of his work.

===Comic strips (1903–1911)===
From January until November 1903, McCay drew an ongoing proto-comic strip for the &quot;Enquirer&quot; based on poems written by George Randolph Chester called &quot;A Tale of the Jungle Imps by Felix Fiddle&quot;. Before the last two installments appeared in print, McCay had moved to New York City to work for James Gordon Bennett, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;New York Herald&quot;, at first doing illustrations and editorial cartoons. He worked alongside comic strip pioneer Richard F. Outcault, who was doing the &quot;Buster Brown&quot; strip at the &quot;Herald&quot;. A rivalry built up between the two cartoonists which resulted in Outcault leaving the &quot;Herald&quot; to return to his previous employer, William Randolph Hearst at &quot;The New York Journal&quot;.

McCay&#x27;s first continuing comic strip, &quot;Mr. Goodenough&quot;, debuted in the &quot;New York Evening Telegram&quot; on January 21, 1904. The formula for the strip was that a sedentary millionaire would seek ways to become more active, with embarrassing results. &quot;Sister&#x27;s Little Sister&#x27;s Beau&quot;, McCay&#x27;s first strip with a child protagonist, lasted one installment that April, and his first color strip, &quot;Phurious Phinish of Phoolish Philipe&#x27;s Phunny Phrolics&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Herald&quot;″s Sunday supplement that May.

McCay&#x27;s first popular comic strip was &quot;Little Sammy Sneeze&quot;. The strip starred a young boy whose sneeze would build panel by panel until it was released, with explosively disastrous results, for which he was usually punished or chased away by those affected. The strip debuted in July 1904 and ran until December 1906.

McCay&#x27;s longest-running strip, &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;, first appeared in &quot;The Evening Telegram&quot; in September 1904. The strip was aimed at an adult audience, and had no recurring characters. The characters that appeared in the strip would have fantastic, sometimes terrifying dreams, only to wake up in the last panel, cursing the Welsh rarebit they had eaten the night before, which they blamed for bringing on the dream. &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; was so popular that a book collection appeared in 1905 from publisher Frederick A. Stokes. It was adapted to film by Edwin S. Porter, and plans were made for a &quot;comic opera or musical extravaganza&quot; for stage that failed to materialize. McCay signed the &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; strips with the pen name &quot;Silas&quot;, as his contract required that he not use his real name for &quot;Evening Telegram&quot; work.

The McCays had been living in Manhattan, close to the &quot;Herald&quot; offices; before 1905 they moved to Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn, New York, a seaside resort on Long Island. It was an hour commute from the &quot;Herald&quot; offices, but they believed it to be a better place to raise children. They lived at a number of addresses before settling into a three-story house at 1901 Voorhies Avenue, where McCay resided for the rest of his life. As his reputation grew, his employers allowed him to work from his home studio more often.

While still turning out illustrations and editorial cartoons daily, McCay began three more continuing strips in 1905. In January, he began &quot;The Story of Hungry Henrietta&quot;, in which the child protagonist visibly ages week by week, and eats compulsively in lieu of the love she craves from her parents. &quot;A Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress by Mister Bunion&quot; was another &quot;Silas&quot; strip for &quot;The Evening Telegram&quot;, which ran from June 1905 until May 1909. Mr. Bunion spent each strip unsuccessfully scheming to rid himself of his suitcase, labeled &quot;Dull Care&quot;.

McCay got &quot;an idea from the &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; to please the little folk&quot;, and in October 1905 the full-page Sunday strip &quot;Little Nemo in Slumberland&quot; debuted in the &quot;Herald&quot;. Considered McCay&#x27;s masterpiece, its child protagonist had fabulous dreams, interrupted each week with his awakening in the final panel. Nemo&#x27;s appearance was based on McCay&#x27;s son Robert. McCay experimented with formal aspects of the comics page: he made inventive use of timing and pacing, the size and shape of panels, perspective, and architectural and other details. The &quot;Herald&quot; was considered to have the highest quality color printing of any newspaper at the time; its printing staff used the Ben Day process for color, and McCay annotated the &quot;Nemo&quot; pages with precise color schemes for the printers.

Impresario F. F. Proctor approached McCay in April 1906 to perform chalk talks for the vaudeville circuit. For $500 per week he was to draw twenty-five sketches in fifteen minutes before live audiences, as a pit band played a piece called &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;. In his &quot;The Seven Ages of Man&quot; routine, he drew two faces and progressively aged them. His first performance was on June 11, 1906, in a show that also featured entertainer W. C. Fields. It was a success, and McCay toured with the show throughout 1907, while managing to complete his comic strip and illustration work on time, often working in hotel rooms or backstage.

As early as 1905, several abortive attempts were made to produce a stage version of &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. In mid-1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they would put on an extravagant &quot;Little Nemo&quot; show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. It starred midget Gabriel Weigel as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip. Reviews were positive; it played to sold-out houses in New York and toured for two seasons. McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where &quot;Little Nemo&quot; played. When the Keith circuit refused McCay to perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise. In several cities, McCay brought his son, who as publicity sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo.

As part of an improvised story, Cawthorn introduced a mythical creature he called a &quot;Whiffenpoof&quot;. The word caught on with the public, and became the name of a and a singing group. Despite the show&#x27;s success, it failed to make back its investment due to its enormous expenses and came to an end in December 1910.

McCay displayed his social awareness in the last strip he created for the &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;Poor Jake&quot;. Its title character was a silent laborer who worked thanklessly for a Colonel and Mrs. Stall, who exploit him. The strip ran from 1909 until spring 1911.

McCay was approached in early 1910 to bring his vaudeville show to Europe. McCay requested the &quot;Herald&quot;″s permission, but the plans never materialized. His show stayed within the Eastern United States until he ceased performing in 1917. Biographer John Canemaker assumed McCay&#x27;s request to tour Europe was turned down, and that the refusal added to McCay&#x27;s growing frustration with the &quot;Herald&quot;. A distrust of big business became pronounced in McCay&#x27;s work around this time, including a story arc in &quot;Little Nemo&quot; in which the characters visit a Mars oppressed by a greedy business magnate.

===Animation (1911–1921)===
McCay said he was most proud of his animation work. He completed ten animated films between 1911 and 1921, and three more were planned.

Inspired by the flip books his son brought home, McCay &quot;came to see the possibility of making moving pictures&quot; of his cartoons. He claimed to be &quot;the first man in the world to make animated cartoons&quot;, though he was preceded by others such as James Stuart Blackton and Émile Cohl. McCay made four thousand drawings on rice paper for his first animated short, which starred his &quot;Little Nemo&quot; characters. They were shot at Vitagraph Studios under Blackton&#x27;s supervision. Live-action sequences were added to the beginning and end of the film, in which McCay bets his newspaper colleagues that in one month he can make four thousand drawings that move. Among those featured in these sequences were cartoonist George McManus and actor John Bunny. &quot;Little Nemo&quot; debuted in movie theatres on April 8, 1911, and four days later McCay began using it as part of his vaudeville act. Its good reception motivated him to hand-color each of the frames of the originally black-and-white animation.

McCay had become frustrated with the &quot;Herald&quot;, partly over money issues and partly because he perceived a lack of freedom. He accepted a higher-paying offer in spring 1911 from Hearst at the &quot;New York American&quot; and took &quot;Little Nemo&quot;″s characters with him. The &quot;Herald&quot; held the strip&#x27;s copyright, but McCay won a lawsuit that allowed him to continue using the characters, which he did under the title &quot;In the Land of Wonderful Dreams&quot;. The &quot;Herald&quot; was unsuccessful in finding another cartoonist to continue the original strip.

McCay began work that May on his next animated film, &quot;How a Mosquito Operates&quot;, based on a &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot; episode from June 5, 1909, in which a man in bed tries in vain to defend himself from a giant mosquito, which drinks itself so full that it explodes. The animation is naturalistic—rather than expanding like a balloon, with each sip of blood the mosquito&#x27;s abdomen swells according to its body structure. The film was completed in January 1912, and McCay toured with it that spring and summer.

&quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; debuted in February 1914 as part of McCay&#x27;s vaudeville act. McCay introduced Gertie as &quot;the only dinosaur in captivity&quot;, and commanded the animated beast with a whip. Gertie seemed to obey McCay, bowing to the audience, and eating a tree and a boulder, though she had a will of her own and sometimes rebelled. When McCay admonished her, she cried. McCay consoled her by throwing her an apple—in reality pocketing the cardboard prop apple as a cartoon one simultaneously appeared on screen. In the finale, McCay walked offstage, reappeared in animated form in the film, and had Gertie carry him away. Producer William Fox&#x27;s Box Office Attractions obtained distribution rights to a modified version of &quot;Gertie&quot; that could be played in regular movie theaters. This version was prefaced with a live-action sequence and replaced the interactive portions with intertitles.

&quot;Gertie&quot; was McCay&#x27;s first piece of animation with detailed backgrounds. McCay drew the foreground characters, while art student neighbor John A. Fitzsimmons traced the backgrounds. McCay pioneered the &quot;McCay Split System&quot; of inbetweening, in which major poses or positions were drawn first, and the intervening frames drawn after. This relieved tedium and improved the timing of the film&#x27;s actions. McCay refused to patent his system, and was sued in 1914 by animator John Randolph Bray, who took advantage of McCay&#x27;s lapse by patenting many of McCay&#x27;s techniques, including the use of registration marks, tracing paper, the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued—he thereafter received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.

Hearst was disappointed with the quality of McCay&#x27;s newspaper work. Infuriated that he couldn&#x27;t reach McCay during a vaudeville performance, Hearst pulled from his papers advertising for the theatre where McCay performed. Editor Arthur Brisbane told him that he was &quot;a serious artist, not a comic cartoonist&quot;, and that he was to give up his comic strip work to focus on editorial illustrations. Hearst pressured McCay&#x27;s agents to reduce the number of his vaudeville appearances, and he was induced to sign a contract with Hearst that limited his vaudeville appearances to greater New York, with occasional exceptions. In February 1917, Hearst had McCay give up entirely on vaudeville and all other paid work outside the Hearst empire, though he was occasionally granted permission for particular shows. Hearst increased McCay&#x27;s salary to cover the loss of income.

McCay was expected to report daily to the &quot;American&quot; building, where he shared a ninth-floor office with humorist Arthur &quot;Bugs&quot; Baer and sports cartoonist Joe McGurk. There, he illustrated editorials by Arthur Brisbane, who often sent back McCay&#x27;s drawings with instructions for changes. The quality of his drawings varied depending on his interest in the subject of the assignment, whether or not he agreed with the sentiments portrayed, and on events in his personal life. For example, in March 1914 he was subjected to a blackmail plot by a Mrs. Lambkin, who was seeking a divorce from her husband. Lambkin alleged that McCay&#x27;s wife Maude was seeing her husband. With McCay&#x27;s level of fame, such a story would likely be in the papers, and Mrs. Lambkin and her husband told McCay that she would keep it secret for $1,000. McCay did not believe the allegations, and gave testimony at the Lambkins&#x27; divorce trial. The blackmail failed, and the divorce was not granted.

Hearst animation studio International Film Service began in December 1915, and brought Hearst cartoonists to the screen. McCay was initially listed as one of them, but the studio never produced anything either by his hands or featuring his creations. McCay derived satisfaction from doing the work himself. Begun in 1916, &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; was his follow-up to &quot;Gertie&quot;. The film was not a fantasy but a detailed, realistic recreation of the 1915 German torpedoing of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. The event counted 128 Americans among its 1,198 dead, and was a factor leading to the American entry into World War I.

McCay&#x27;s daughter Marion married military man Raymond T. Moniz, eighteen years her senior, on October 13, 1917. She gave birth to McCay&#x27;s first grandchild, Ray Winsor Moniz, on July 16, 1918. Moniz and McCay&#x27;s son Robert were called up for service when the U.S. entered World War I.

McCay&#x27;s self-financed &quot;Lusitania&quot; took nearly two years to complete. With the assistance of John Fitzsimmons and Cincinnati cartoonist William Apthorp &quot;Ap&quot; Adams, McCay spent his off hours drawing the film on sheets of cellulose acetate (or &quot;cels&quot;) with white and black India ink at McCay&#x27;s home. It was the first film McCay made using cels, a technology animator Earl Hurd had patented in 1914; it saved work by allowing dynamic drawings to be made on one or more layers, which could be laid over a static background layer, relieving animators of the tedium of retracing static images onto drawing after drawing. McCay had the cels photographed at the Vitagraph studios. The film was naturalistically animated, and made use of dramatic camera angles that would have been impossible in a live-action film.

Jewel Productions released the film on July 20, 1918. Advertising touted it as &quot;the picture that will &quot;never&quot; have a competitor&quot;; the film itself called McCay &quot;the originator and inventor of Animated Cartoons&quot; and drew attention to the fact that it took 25,000 drawings to complete. &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; did not greatly return on McCay&#x27;s investment—after a few years&#x27; run in theaters, it netted $80,000.

McCay continued to produce animated films using cels. By 1921, he had completed six, though three were likely never shown commercially to audiences and have survived only in fragments: &quot;The Centaurs&quot;, &quot;Flip&#x27;s Circus&quot;, and &quot;Gertie on Tour&quot;. In 1921, he released three films based on &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;: &quot;Bug Vaudeville&quot;, in which insects and other creepy-crawlies perform on stage; &quot;The Pet&quot;, in which a creature with a bottomless appetite grows enormously and terrorizes the city in a way reminiscent of &quot;King Kong&quot;; and &quot;The Flying House&quot;, in which a man attaches wings to his house to flee from debt. McCay&#x27;s son Robert is credited with the animation on this last film, but Canemaker notes it is highly unlikely that a first-time animator could have produced such an accomplished piece of animation.

===Later career (1921–1934)===
After 1921, McCay was made to give up on animation when Hearst learned he devoted more of his time to animation than to his newspaper illustrations. Unexecuted ideas McCay had for animation projects included a collaboration with &quot;Jungle Imps&quot; author George Randolph Chester, a musical film called &quot;The Barnyard Band&quot;, and a film about the Americans&#x27; role in World War I.

McCay&#x27;s son Robert married Theresa &quot;Tedda&quot; Munchausen on April 9, 1921. McCay bought them a nearby house as a wedding gift. The couple gave McCay two more grandchildren: Janet (named after McCay&#x27;s mother) in 1922, and Robert in 1928. Robert suffered shell shock during World War I, and following the war had difficulty drawing. McCay tried to boost his son&#x27;s confidence by finding him cartooning work, and some of the elder McCay&#x27;s editorial cartoons were signed &quot;Robert Winsor McCay, Jr.&quot; Robert also briefly revived the &quot;Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend&quot; strip as &quot;Rabid Reveries&quot; starting in 1924.

In 1922, McCay resumed doing vaudeville shows for the Keith circuit. He had a cameo in a newspaper office scene in the boxing film &quot;The Great White Way&quot; in early 1924.

McCay left Hearst upon the expiration of his contract in May 1924, bitter over not having received a promised $5,000 bonus. He returned to the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;, and brought back &quot;Little Nemo&quot; beginning that August. The new strip displayed the virtuoso technique of the old, but the panels were laid out in an unvarying grid. Nemo took a more passive role in the stories, and there was no continuity. The strip came to an end in December 1926, as it was not popular with readers. Hearst executives had been trying to convince McCay to return to the &quot;American&quot;, and succeeded in 1927. While McCay was gone, his place had been filled by Mel Cummin, who was let go after McCay&#x27;s return. Due to the lack of the 1920s Nemo&#x27;s success, the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; signed over all copyrights to the strip to McCay for one dollar.

In 1927, McCay attended a dinner in his honor in New York. After a considerable amount of drinking, McCay was introduced by animator Max Fleischer. McCay gave the gathered group of animators some technical advice, but when he felt the audience was not giving him attention, he berated his audience, saying, &quot;Animation is an art. That is how I conceived it. But as I see, what you fellows have done with it, is making it into a trade. Not an art, but a trade. &quot;Bad Luck!&quot;&quot; That September he appeared on the radio at WNAC, and on November 2 he was interviewed by Frank Craven for &quot;The Evening Journal&quot;″s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;. During both appearances he complained about the state of contemporary animation.

An executive of the American Tobacco Company approached McCay in 1929 to do an advertising campaign for a financial &quot;sum in excess of his annual salary&quot;. Brisbane refused, noting that McCay&#x27;s contract didn&#x27;t allow outside work. When the executive stormed into Brisbane&#x27;s office threatening to pull American Tobacco&#x27;s advertising dollars from the &quot;American&quot;, Brisbane provided a written release for the work.

In 1932, McCay found himself in what he recalled as &quot;the wildest ride&quot; in his life when Hearst&#x27;s son &quot;Young Bill&quot; drove him at to the scene of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. They arrived there two hours after the crime was first reported to police, and were able to interview the gathered police before the grounds were closed off to the public. McCay sketched the scene, the staff, and the ladders the kidnappers used, which he was allowed to see up close.
===Death===
McCay enjoyed robust health most of his life. On July 26, 1934, he complained to his wife of a severe head-ache. To his horror, he found his right arm—his drawing arm—was paralyzed. He lost consciousness and was pronounced dead later that afternoon, with his wife, children, and son-in-law by his side. He had died of a cerebral embolism, and was buried at the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn in a family plot. He had a Masonic funeral in his home, attended by his newspaper colleagues, Hearst and his son, and the Society of Illustrators, among others.

Brisbane hired back Mel Cummin to replace McCay. Due to his lavish life-style, McCay left a smaller fortune than those around him had expected. By the early 1940s, Maude had used up her inheritance and sold the house on Voorhies Avenue. When she died of a heart attack on March 2, 1949, she was living with her daughter and son-in-law. Son Robert was also careless with his inheritance, and less successful in art than his father. He worked for a short time at the Hearst papers, and tried unsuccessfully to get a job at the Disney studios, before finding a career as illustrator for Training Aids/Special Services at Fort Ord.

==Personal life==
Self-conscious and introverted in private, McCay was nevertheless a charismatic showman and self-promoter, and maintained several lifelong friendships. McCay was a light but frequent drinker; he drank for camaraderie rather than for a love of drinking. To his wife&#x27;s chagrin, McCay was a smoker of cigars and cigarettes. He was self-taught at the piano, and was an avid reader of poetry, plays and novels; he admired W. B. Yeats, knew the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats, and could quote the Bible and Shakespeare.

McCay stood barely five feet () tall, and felt dominated by his wife, who was nearly as tall as he was. McCay married Maude Leonore Dufour, the youngest of three daughters of French-Canadian carriage painter John Dufour. About a decade separated the couple&#x27;s ages: Maude was 14 when they married. Biographer Canemaker speculates this may explain the lack of certainty behind McCay&#x27;s birthdate, even by McCay himself, as he may have claimed to be younger than he was to justify marrying a teenaged girl. Maude was also age-conscious: she preferred her grandchildren to call her &quot;Nan&quot; instead of &quot;Grandma&quot; and dyed her hair as she got older. The McCays took on the traditional roles of a married couple of the time, in that Winsor was the breadwinner and Maude the homemaker. Neither spouse got along well with the other&#x27;s mother.

The couple had two children: Robert Winsor, born June 21, 1896; and Marion Elizabeth, born August 22, 1897. McCay was said to be easy-going with the children, and left discipline to their stern mother. Marion felt domineered by her mother and perceived that her brother was her mother&#x27;s favorite; she was closer to her father and often appeared in public with him. Robert looked up to his father and became an artist himself. He was proud to have served as the model for Little Nemo.

The McCays lived lavishly. McCay disliked driving, so he kept a chauffeur who also served as a bodyguard, as the editorial cartoons McCay drew for Hearst sometimes attracted threatening letters. Maude made daily trips by limousine to shop in upscale downtown Brooklyn with other well-to-do wives. Maude often complained to her husband, but he refused to discuss matters with her.

McCay&#x27;s politics are unclear, and it is disputed whether he sympathized with the views displayed in his editorial cartoons. He was agnostic and believed in reincarnation. He was a Freemason, whose ranks he may have joined as early as when he was living in Chicago. His father had also been a Freemason, and was buried in 1915 with full Masonic rites, with funerals arranged by his Masonic lodges in both Woodstock, Ontario, and Edmore, Michigan. His mother often visited him in Brooklyn, and attended &quot;Little Nemo&quot;″s Philadelphia premiere. She died in Edmore, Michigan, in 1927.

McCay&#x27;s brother Arthur was placed in a mental hospital in Traverse City, Michigan on March 7, 1898, where he stayed until his death from bronchopneumonia and arteriosclerosis on June 15, 1946. He never received family visits. McCay never let his children know about his brother, nor did they know about the existence of his sister Mae, who died in 1910.

==Legacy==
In 1937, McCay&#x27;s son Robert attempted to carry on his father&#x27;s legacy by reviving &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. Comic book packager Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler&#x27;s syndicate announced a Sunday and daily &quot;Nemo&quot; strip, credited to &quot;Winsor McCay Jr.&quot; Robert also drew a comic book version for Chesler called &quot;Nemo in Adventureland&quot; starring grown-up versions of Nemo and the Princess. Neither project lasted long. In 1947, Robert and fabric salesman Irving Mendelsohn organized the McCay Feature Syndicate, Inc. to revive the original &quot;Nemo&quot; strip from McCay&#x27;s original art, modified to fit the size of modern newspaper pages. This revival also did not last.

McCay&#x27;s original artwork has been poorly preserved. McCay insisted on having his originals returned to him, and a large collection that survived him was destroyed in a fire in the late 1930s. His wife was unsure how to handle the surviving pieces, so his son took on the responsibility and moved the collection to his own house. The family sold off some of the artwork when they were in need of cash. Responsibility for it passed to Mendelsohn, then later to daughter Marion. By the early twenty-first century, most of McCay&#x27;s surviving artwork remained in family hands.

McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. Of what film he kept, much has not survived, as it was photographed on 35mm nitrate film, which decomposes and is highly flammable. Mendelsohn&#x27;s son and a friend, both young animators, discovered the film in Mendelsohn&#x27;s possession in 1947 and rescued what they could. In some cases, such as &quot;The Centaurs&quot;, only fragments could be saved. A negative and incomplete positive was discovered of &quot;Performing Animals&quot;, a film of animals playing instruments that may have been intended for McCay&#x27;s vaudeville act; it was deemed unsalvageable and destroyed.

In 1966, cartoonist Woody Gelman discovered the original artwork for many &quot;Little Nemo&quot; strips at a cartoon studio where McCay&#x27;s son Robert had worked. Many of the recovered originals were displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art under the direction of curator A. Hyatt Mayor. In 1973, Gelman published a collection of &quot;Little Nemo&quot; strips in Italy. His collection of McCay originals is preserved at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum at Ohio State University.

McCay&#x27;s work, grounded solidly in his understanding of realistic perspective, presaged the techniques featured in Walt Disney&#x27;s feature films. Disney paid tribute to McCay in 1955 on an episode of &quot;Disneyland&quot;. The episode, &quot;The Story of Animated Drawing&quot;, gave a history of animation, and dramatized McCay&#x27;s vaudeville act with &quot;Gertie&quot;. Robert was invited to the Disney studios as a consultant on the episode, where Disney told him, &quot;Bob, all this should be your father&#x27;s&quot;.

Animator and McCay biographer John Canemaker produced a film in 1974 called &quot;Remembering Winsor McCay&quot;, narrated by McCay&#x27;s animation assistant John Fitzsimmons. Canemaker helped coordinate the first retrospective of McCay&#x27;s films at the third International Animation Film Festival in 1975 in New York, which led to a film show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in winter 1975–76. Canemaker also wrote a biography in 1987 called &quot;Winsor McCay: His Life and Art&quot;. In 2005, a revised and expanded version of the biography was released, which comics scholar Jeet Heer called &quot;far and away the most scholarly and intelligent biography ever written about an American cartoonist&quot;. Animation scholar Paul Wells stated, &quot;McCay&#x27;s influence on the history of animation cannot be understated&quot;. Film critic Richard Eder lamented that as an animation pioneer McCay was not able to reach the potential suggested by his work. Eder compared McCay to the Italian primitives of the early Renaissance, highly skilled &quot;in the limited techniques they could command&quot;. Heer wrote that McCay&#x27;s strength was in his visuals, but that his writing and characters were weak.
Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini read &quot;Little Nemo&quot; in the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Il corriere dei piccoli&quot;, and the strip was a &quot;powerful influence&quot; on the filmmaker, according to Fellini biographer Peter Bondanella. Comics historian R. C. Harvey has called McCay &quot;the first original genius of the comic strip medium&quot; and in animation. Harvey said that McCay&#x27;s contemporaries lacked the skill to continue with his innovations, so that they were left for future generations to rediscover and build upon.

McCay&#x27;s work has inspired cartoonists from Carl Barks to Art Spiegelman. Robert Crumb called McCay a &quot;genius&quot; and one of his favorite cartoonists. Art Spiegelman&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Real Dream&quot; strip was partially inspired by &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;, and his &quot;In the Shadow of No Towers&quot; in 2004 appropriated some of McCay&#x27;s imagery, and included a page of &quot;Little Nemo&quot; in its appendix. Maurice Sendak&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;In the Night Kitchen&quot; (1970) was an homage to McCay&#x27;s work, as was Rick Veitch&#x27; comic book series &quot;Roarin&#x27; Rick&#x27;s Rarebit Fiends&quot; (1994–96). Kim Deitch and Simon Deitch&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot; revolved around a character named Winsor Newton, based on an aged McCay. Cartoonist Berke Breathed lamented that the conditions of newspaper cartooning had devolved to such a degree since McCay&#x27;s time that, had he worked later in the century, he would not have been allotted space sufficient for his expansive full-page fantasies.

As Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;The Interpretation of Dreams&quot; first appeared in print in 1899, McCay&#x27;s major dream strips work have invited speculation of a Freudian influence. But it can be proved that McCay&#x27;s influence, at least in a secondhand manner, reached Freud: Hungarian artist Nándor Honti, heavily inspired by McCay&#x27;s &quot;Rarebit Fiend&quot;, which he had seen when he lived in the United States from 1903 to about 1907, created a comic page titled &quot;A Francia Bonne Álma&quot; (&quot;A French Nanny&#x27;s Dream&quot;, often called &quot;A French Nurse&#x27;s Dream&quot;, 1911), which was passed to Sigmund Freud by the Hungarian psychoanalyst Sándor Ferenczi. Freud then included the comic in the 1914 edition of his book. Honti&#x27;s comic strongly resembles the work of McCay in its theme, pacing, Art Nouveau style, and closing panel of the dreamer awakening in bed.

The Winsor McCay Award was established in 1972 to recognize individuals for lifetime or career contributions in animation, and is presented as part of the Annie Awards. The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles devoted a room to McCay&#x27;s work as part of the &quot;Masters of American Comics&quot; exhibit in 2005. German publisher Taschen published a complete, boxed, full-size edition of &quot;Little Nemo&quot; in two volumes in 2014 entitled &quot;The Complete Little Nemo&quot;.

The American astronomer Roy A. Tucker named the asteroid 113461 after McCay in 2002.

Despite dispute over his birthplace, a public park and historical marker honor McCay in Spring Lake, Michigan. The marker, unveiled in 2009, is located in Winsor McCay Park. Winsor McCay Park is the modern-day location of where Union School once stood, wherein McCay &quot;illustrated his first &#x27;commercial&#x27; for-sale illustration&quot; in 1880. Developers have been working since 2009 to develop the park into a more sophisticated memorial to McCay including &quot;a large Gertie the Dinosaur statue at the entrance of the park...a bronze statue of Winsor McCay that will be placed next to the historical marker/sign [and] Gertie the Dinosaur stepping-stone footprints [that] will meander through the park, leading back to a scaled-down replica of Union School.&quot;

==Style==
Virtually from the beginning, McCay innovated with the forms of his chosen media. He varied the size and shape of comic strip panels for dramatic effect, as in the second instalment of &quot;Little Nemo&quot; (October 22, 1905), where the panels grow to adapt to a growing forest of mushrooms. Few of McCay&#x27;s contemporaries were so bold with their page layouts. Near-contemporary George Herriman with &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; was the most notable example, but it was not until a generation later that cartoonists such as Frank King with &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, Hal Foster with &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, and Roy Crane with &quot;Captain Easy&quot; attempted such daring designs on their Sunday pages.

McCay&#x27;s detailed hatching and mastery of perspective enhanced the illusions in his drawings, particularly in &quot;Little Nemo&quot;. Fantastic grotesqueries such as what McCay witnessed during his time at the Wonderland and Eden Musee appeared often in McCay&#x27;s work. McCay was noted for the speed and accuracy with which he could draw; crowds of people would gather around to watch him paint billboards.

McCay had a taste for the ornate. The architecture he drew was inspired by that of carnivals, the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the detailed illustrations in British illustrated newspapers &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; and &quot;The Graphic&quot;. The of Paris published a series of illustrated books called &quot;Images Enphantines&quot;, whose pages bear a striking resemblance to McCay&#x27;s early &quot;Little Nemo&quot; strips, both in their graphic sense and their imaginative layouts.

To Canemaker, McCay had an &quot;absolute precision of line&quot; akin to those of Northern Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer and 19th-century French illustrator Gustave Doré. McCay drew with Higgins black drawing ink, Gillott pens, art gum, a T-square and angle, and an assortment of Venus lead pencils. In his early magazine cartoons McCay often painted in gouache.

McCay used metafictional techniques such as self-referentiality in his work. This was most frequent in &quot;Dream of the Rarebit Fiend&quot;, where McCay sometimes put himself in the strip, or had characters address the reader. Sometimes characters become aware of the strip itself—a jealous lover tears the very strip apart in which he appears; another character fastens panel borders to his strip when he realizes the artist has forgotten them; and in a &quot;Sammy Sneeze&quot; episode Sammy&#x27;s sneeze destroys the panel borders.

In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in McCay&#x27;s speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility, and &quot;disfigur[ing] his otherwise flawless work&quot;, according to critic R. C. Harvey. This is further highlighted by the level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering. McCay seemed to show little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition. They tended to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and showed that McCay&#x27;s gift was in the visual and not the verbal.

In his comics and animation McCay used stock ethnic stereotypes common in his era. A conscious attempt to offend is not apparent. He depicted blacks as savages, or wishing they could be white. Most prominent were a pair of characters in &quot;Little Nemo&quot;: the ill-tempered Irishman Flip and the rarely speaking grass-skirted African Little Imp. In the animated &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, the Anglo-Saxon Nemo is shown drawn in a dignified Art Nouveau style, and controls by magic the more grotesquely caricatured Flip and Imp. Women were few in McCay&#x27;s work, and were depicted as superficial, jealous, and argumentative; the Princess in &quot;Little Nemo&quot; never partook in the camaraderie the males shared.

<text>The Municipality of Princeton is a borough in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. It was established on January 1, 2013, through the consolidation of the Borough of Princeton and Princeton Township, both of which are now defunct. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 30,681, an increase of 2,109 (+7.4%) from the 2010 census combined count of 28,572. In the 2000 census, the two communities had a total population of 30,230, with 14,203 residents in the borough and 16,027 in the township.

Princeton was founded before the American Revolutionary War. The borough is the home of Princeton University, one of the world&#x27;s most acclaimed research universities, which bears its name and moved to the community in 1756 from the educational institution&#x27;s previous location in Newark. Although its association with the university is primarily what makes Princeton a college town, other important institutions in the area include the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Princeton Theological Seminary, Opinion Research Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Siemens Corporate Research, SRI International, FMC Corporation, Educational Testing Service, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Amrep, Church and Dwight, Berlitz International, and Dow Jones &amp; Company.

Princeton is roughly equidistant from New York City and Philadelphia. It is close to many major highways that serve both cities (e.g., Interstate 95 and U.S. Route 1), and receives major television and radio broadcasts from each. It is also close to Trenton, New Jersey&#x27;s capital city, New Brunswick and Edison.

The New Jersey governor&#x27;s official residence has been in Princeton since 1945, when Morven (in what was then Princeton Borough) became the first governor&#x27;s mansion. In 1982, it was replaced by the larger Drumthwacket, a colonial mansion located in the former township, but not all have actually lived in these houses. Morven became a museum and garden, owned and operated by the New Jersey Historical Society.

Throughout much of its history, the community was split into two separate municipalities: a township and a borough. The central borough was completely surrounded by the township. The borough seceded from the township in 1894 in a dispute over school taxes; the two municipalities later formed Princeton Public Schools, and some other public services were conducted together before they were reunited into a single Princeton in January 2013. Princeton Borough contained Nassau Street, the main commercial street, most of the university campus, and incorporated most of the urban area until the postwar suburbanization. The borough and township had roughly equal populations. Other major streets include Harrison, Witherspoon, Nassau, Bayard, Washington, and Stockton.

==History==
===Early history===

The Lenape Native Americans were the earliest identifiable inhabitants of the Princeton area.

Europeans settled into the area in the late part of the 17th century, arriving from Delaware to settle West Jersey, and from New York to settle East Jersey, with the site destined to become Princeton being amid the wilderness between these two boroughs. The first European to find his home in the boundaries of the future municipality was Henry Greenland. He built his house in 1683 along with a tavern, where representatives of West and East Jersey met to set the boundaries between the two provinces. Greenland&#x27;s son-in-law Daniel Brimson inhabited the area by 1690, and left property in a will dated 1696.

Then, Princeton was known only as part of nearby Stony Brook. Nathaniel Fitz Randolph, a native of the town, attested in his private journal on December 28, 1758, that Princeton was named in 1724 upon the making/construction of the first house in the area by James Leonard, who first referred to the community as &quot;Princetown&quot; when describing the location of his large estate in his diary. The community was later known by a variety of names, including: &quot;Princetown&quot;, &quot;Prince&#x27;s Town&quot; and finally &quot;Princeton&quot;. The name Princeton was first used in 1724 and became common within the subsequent decade. Although there is no official documentary backing, the municipality is said to be named after Prince William of Orange. Another theory suggests that the name came from a large land-owner named Henry Prince, the son-in-law of a well-known English merchant, but no evidence backs this contention. A royal prince seems a more likely eponym for the settlement, as three nearby towns had names for royalty: Kingston, Queenstown (in the vicinity of the intersection of Nassau and Harrison Streets) and Princessville (Lawrence Township).

Princeton was described by William Edward Schenck in 1850 as having attained &quot;no very considerable size&quot; until the establishment of the College of New Jersey in the town. When Richard Stockton, one of the founders of the township, died in 1709 he left his estate to his sons, who helped to expand property and the population. Based on the 1880 United States census, the population of Princeton comprised 3,209 persons (not including students). Local population has expanded from the nineteenth century. According to the 2010 census, Princeton Borough had 12,307 inhabitants, while Princeton Township had 16,265. The numbers have become stagnant; since the arrival of the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, in 1756, the town&#x27;s population spikes every year during the fall and winter and drops significantly over the course of the summer.

===Revolution===
In the pivotal Battle of Princeton in January 1777, George Washington forced the British to evacuate southern New Jersey. After the victory, Princeton hosted the first Legislature under the State Constitution to decide the State&#x27;s seal, governor and organization of its government. In addition, two of the original signers of the Declaration of Independence—Richard Stockton and John Witherspoon—lived in Princeton. Princetonians honored their citizens&#x27; legacy by naming two streets in the downtown area after them.

On January 10, 1938, Henry Ewing Hale called for a group of citizens to establish a &quot;Historical Society of Princeton&quot;. Later the Bainbridge House, constructed in 1766 by Job Stockton, would be dedicated for this purpose. Previously the house was used once for a meeting of Continental Congress in 1783, a general office, and as the Princeton Public Library. The House is owned by Princeton University and is leased to the Princeton Historical Society for one dollar per year. The house has kept its original staircase, flooring and paneled walls. Around 70% of the house has been unaltered. Aside from safety features such as wheelchair access and electrical work, the house has been restored to its original appearance and character.

===Government history===
During the most stirring events in its history, Princeton was a wide spot in the road; the boundary between Somerset County and Middlesex County ran right through Princeton, along the high road between New York and Philadelphia, now Nassau Street. When Mercer County was formed in 1838, part of West Windsor Township was added to the portion of Montgomery Township which was included in the new county, and made into Princeton Township; the area between the southern boundary of the former Borough and the Delaware and Raritan Canal was added to Princeton Township in 1853. Princeton Borough became a separate municipality in 1894.

In the early nineteenth century, New Jersey boroughs had been quasi-independent subdivisions chartered within existing townships that did not have full autonomy. Princeton Borough received such a charter in 1813, as part of Montgomery and West Windsor Townships; it continued to be part of Princeton Township until the Borough Act of 1894, which required each township to form a single school district; rather than do so, Princeton Borough petitioned to be separated. (The two Princetons combined their public school systems in the decades before municipal consolidation.) Two minor boundary changes united the then site of the Princeton Hospital and of the Princeton Regional High School inside the Borough, in 1928 and 1951 respectively. See the section on &quot;government and politics&quot; for more details about the 2011 merger of borough and township.

==Geography==
Princeton is located just south of a long, curving ridge known as Princeton Ridge. As Princeton is in a low-lying area, there have been issues with cell phone signals. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Princeton had a total area of 18.41 square miles (47.69 km2), including 17.95 square miles (46.48 km2) of land and 0.47 square miles (1.21 km2) of water (2.53%).

Cedar Grove, Port Mercer, Princeton Basin, and Jugtown are unincorporated communities that have been absorbed into Greater Princeton over the years, but still maintain their own community identity.

Princeton borders the municipalities of Hopewell Township, Lawrence Township, and West Windsor Township in Mercer County; Plainsboro Township and South Brunswick Township in Middlesex County; and Franklin Township and Montgomery Township in Somerset County.

United States Postal ZIP codes for Princeton include 08540, 08541 (Educational Testing Service), 08542 (largely the old Borough), 08543 (PO boxes), and 08544 (the University).

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Princeton falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) if the isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) if the isotherm is used. During the summer months, episodes of extreme heat and humidity can occur with heat index values at or above . On average, the wettest month of the year is July which corresponds with the annual peak in thunderstorm activity. During the winter months, episodes of extreme cold and wind can occur with wind chill values below . The plant hardiness zone at the Princeton Municipal Court is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of . The average seasonal (November–April) snowfall total is and the average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in nor&#x27;easter activity.

===Ecology===
According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. potential natural vegetation types, Princeton, New Jersey, would have an Appalachian Oak (&quot;104&quot;) vegetation type with an Eastern Hardwood Forest (&quot;25&quot;) vegetation form.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
As of the 2010 United States census, the borough and township had a combined population of 28,572.

According to the website Data USA, Princeton has a population of 30,168 people, of which 85% are US citizens. The ethnic composition of the population is 20,393 White residents (67.6%), 4,636 Asian residents (15.4%), 2,533 Hispanic residents (8.4%), 1,819 Black residents (6.03%), and 618 Two+ residents (2.05%). The most common foreign languages are Chinese (1,800 speakers), Spanish (1,429 speakers), and French (618 speakers), but compared to other places, Princeton has a relatively high number of speakers of Scandinavian languages (425 speakers), Italian (465 speakers), and German (1,000 speakers).

==Government and politics==

===Local government===
Princeton is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Princeton is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office, serves as Princeton&#x27;s chief executive officer and nominates appointees to various boards and commissions subject to approval of the council. The mayor presides at council meetings and votes in the case of a tie or a few other specific cases. The council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The council has administrative powers and is the policy-making body for Princeton. The council approves appointments made by the mayor. Council members serve on various boards and committees and act as liaisons to certain departments, committees or boards.

, the mayor of Princeton is Democrat Mark Freda, who is serving a four-year term expiring on December 31, 2023. Members of the Princeton Council are Council President Mia Sacks (D, 2025), David F. Cohen (D, 2023), Leticia Fraga (D, 2023), Michelle Pirone Lambros (D, 2025), Leighton Newlin (D, 2024) and Eve Niedergang (D, 2024).

In 2018, Princeton had an average property tax bill of $19,388, the highest in the county, compared to an average bill of $8,767 statewide.

===Merger of borough and township===
People in the township tried unsuccessfully to merge borough and township in a struggle that lasted nearly fifty years. The first failed attempt to consolidate borough and township was made in 1953, with 63% of township voters in favor of a merger and 57% of borough voters opposed. Subsequent attempts were voted down by borough residents, in large part due to different zoning needs of the densely populated borough versus the more widely spaced properties of the township (surrounding the borough). An attempt to consolidate in 1979 passed with 70% support in the township but failed in the borough by 33 votes, a result that was upheld after a recount. Although township voters again supported a 1996 merger referendum by an almost 3–1 margin, about 57% of borough voters rejected the consolidation proposal, marking the sixth such failure.

The residents of both the Borough of Princeton and the Township of Princeton voted on November 8, 2011, to merge the two municipalities into one. This was the first referendum when university student voters were encouraged and allowed to register to vote locally, and that likely contributed strongly to the measure passing, as the students were not home owners concerned with zoning matters, and they all counted as part of the borough and not the township. In Princeton Borough, 1,385 voted for and 902 voted against, while in Princeton Township 3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the merger asserted that when the merger is completed the new Municipality of Princeton would save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled down services including layoffs of 15 government workers including 9 police officers (however the measure itself does not mandate such layoffs). Opponents of the measure challenged the findings of a report citing a cost savings as unsubstantiated, expressed concerns about differing zoning needs between borough and township, and noted that voter representation would be reduced in a smaller government structure. The merger was the first in the state since 1997, when Pahaquarry Township voted to consolidate with Hardwick Township The consolidation took effect on January 1, 2013.

===Federal, state and county representation===
Princeton is located in the 12th Congressional District and is part of New Jersey&#x27;s 16th state legislative district.



===Politics===
As of March 2011, there were a total of 18,049 registered voters in Princeton (a sum of the former borough and township&#x27;s voters), of which 9,184 (50.9%) were registered as Democrats, 2,140 (11.9%) were registered as Republicans and 6,703 (37.1%) were registered as unaffiliated. There were 22 voters registered as Libertarians or Greens.

In the 2016, 2020, and 2024 presidential elections, the Democratic nominee received over 80% of the vote. Since at least 2012, that year&#x27;s and the 2024 presidential election were the only elections where the Republican nominee earned over 15% of the vote in the borough. In the 2012 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama received 75.4% of the vote (9,461 cast), ahead of Republican Mitt Romney with 23.0% (2,882 votes), and other candidates with 1.6% (205 votes), among the 14,752 ballots cast by the municipality&#x27;s 20,328 registered voters (2,204 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 72.6%.

In the 2013 gubernatorial election, Democrat Barbara Buono received 58.8% of the vote (4,172 cast), ahead of Republican Chris Christie with 39.2% (2,780 votes), and other candidates with 2.0% (145 votes), among the 7,279 ballots cast by the municipality&#x27;s 18,374 registered voters (182 ballots were spoiled), for a turnout of 39.6%.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===


Princeton University, one of the world&#x27;s most prominent research universities, is a dominant feature of the community. Established in 1746 as the College of New Jersey and relocated to Princeton ten years later, Princeton University&#x27;s main campus has its historic center on Nassau Street and stretches south from there. Its James Forrestal satellite campus is located in Plainsboro Township, and some playing fields lie within adjacent West Windsor Township. Princeton University was featured at the top of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s national university rankings for the ninth consecutive year in 2024, as well as topping comparable lists by &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

Princeton Theological Seminary, the first and oldest seminary in America of the Presbyterian Church (USA), has its main academic campus in Princeton, with residential housing located just outside of Princeton in West Windsor Township.

The Institute for Advanced Study maintains extensive land holdings (the &quot;Institute Woods&quot;) there covering .

Mercer County Community College, not actually in Princeton but in nearby West Windsor, is a two-year public college serving Princeton residents and all those from Mercer County.

Westminster Choir College, a school of music owned by Rider University since 1992, was established on a large campus in Princeton in 1932. Before relocating to Princeton, the school resided in Dayton, Ohio, and then briefly in Ithaca, New York. In 2012, Rider proposed a parking lot expansion on the Princeton campus that required cutting old-growth trees and was strenuously opposed by neighbors. In 2019, Rider (which is located in Lawrence Township) attempted to sell the choir college campus in Princeton to a Chinese company, resulting in a public outcry and the prevention of that sale. In 2020, Rider moved all activities of Westminster Choir College from Princeton to its Lawrenceville campus; the Princeton campus is now largely unused while legal wrangling continues about the future of the campus and its academic programs. As of 2023, Princeton is paying Rider $1,000 per month to lease overflow parking at the Choir College; the town then sells the parking rights for $30 per month to businesses, residents and non-residents. The Choir College parking is a few blocks&#x27; walk from downtown.

===Primary and secondary schools===
====Public schools====

The Princeton Public Schools serve students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. Students from Cranbury Township attend the district&#x27;s high school as part of a sending/receiving relationship. As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of six schools, had an enrollment of 3,740 students and 341.0 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.0:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
Community Park School with 332 students in grades K-5, 
Johnson Park School with 329 students in grades PreK-5, 
Littlebrook School with 342 students in grades K-5, 
Riverside School with 289 students in grades PreK-5, 
Princeton Middle School with 803 students in grades 6-8 and 
Princeton High School with 1,555 students in grades 9–12.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Princeton High School as the 20th best high school in New Jersey in its 2018 rankings of the &quot;Top Public High Schools&quot; in New Jersey. The school was also ranked as the 10th best school in New Jersey by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report.&quot; Niche ranked Princeton High School as the 47th best public high school in America in its &quot;2021 Best Public High Schools in America&quot; rankings.

In the early 1990s, redistricting occurred between the Community Park and Johnson Park School districts, as the population within both districts had increased due to residential development. Concerns were also raised about the largely white, wealthy student population attending Johnson Park (JP) and the more racially and economically diverse population at Community Park (CP). As a result of the redistricting, portions of the affluent Western Section neighborhood were redistricted to CP, and portions of the racially and economically diverse John Witherspoon neighborhood were redistricted to JP.

The Princeton Charter School (grades K–8) operates under a charter granted by the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Education. The school is a public school that operates independently of the Princeton Regional Schools, and is funded on a per student basis by locally raised tax revenues.

Eighth grade students from all of Mercer County are eligible to apply to attend the high school programs offered by the Mercer County Technical Schools, a county-wide vocational school district that offers full-time career and technical education at its Health Sciences Academy, STEM Academy and Academy of Culinary Arts, with no tuition charged to students for attendance.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===

====Roads and highways====

, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Mercer County, and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Several major roads pass through Princeton. U.S. Route 206 and Route 27 pass through, along with County Routes 583, 526/571 (commonly known as Washington Road) and 533.

Other major roads that are accessible outside the municipality include U.S. Route 1 (in Lawrence Township, West Windsor and South Brunswick), Interstate 287 (in Franklin Township), Interstate 295 (in Lawrence Township), and the New Jersey Turnpike/Interstate 95 (in South Brunswick). The closest Turnpike exits are Interchange 8A in Monroe Township, Interchange 8 in East Windsor, and Interchange 7A in Robbinsville Township.

A number of proposed highways around Princeton have been canceled. The Somerset Freeway (I-95) was to pass just outside the municipality before ending in Hopewell (to the south) and Franklin (to the north). This project was canceled in 1980. Route 92 was supposed to remedy the lack of limited-access highways to the greater Princeton area. The road would have started at Route 1 near Ridge Road in South Brunswick and ended at Exit 8A of the Turnpike. However, that project was cancelled in 2006.

====Public transportation====

Princeton is roughly equidistant from New York City and Philadelphia. Since the 19th century, it has been connected by rail to both of these cities by the Princeton Branch rail line to the nearby Princeton Junction station on Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. The Princeton train station was moved from under Blair Hall to a more southerly location on University Place in 1918, and was moved further southeast in 2013. Commuting to New York from Princeton became commonplace after the Second World War. While the Amtrak ride time is similar to New York and to Philadelphia, the commuter-train ride to New York—via NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line—is generally much faster than the equivalent train ride to Philadelphia, which involves a transfer to SEPTA trains in Trenton. NJ Transit provides shuttle service between the Princeton and Princeton Junction stations; the train is locally called the &quot;Dinky&quot;, and has also been known as the &quot;PJ&amp;B&quot; (for &quot;Princeton Junction and Back&quot;). Two train cars, or sometimes just one, are used.

NJ Transit provides bus service to Trenton on the 606 route and local service on route 605.

Coach USA Suburban Transit operates frequent daily service to midtown NYC on the 100 route, and weekday rush-hour service to downtown NYC on the 600 route.

Princeton and Princeton University provide the FreeB and Tiger Transit local bus services.

====Air====

Princeton Airport is a public airport located north of Downtown Princeton in Montgomery Township. The private Forrestal Airport was located on Princeton University property, east of the main campus, from the early 1950s through the early 1990s.

The closest commercial airport is Trenton-Mercer Airport in Ewing Township, about from the center of Princeton, which is served by Frontier Airlines nonstop to and from 17 cities. Other nearby major airports are Newark Liberty International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport, located and away, respectively.

===Healthcare===

Penn Medicine Princeton Medical Center (commonly abbreviated as &quot;PMC&quot;) is a regional hospital and healthcare network located in neighboring Plainsboro Township. The hospital serves the greater Princeton region in Central Jersey. It is owned by the Penn Medicine Health System and is the only hospital of such in the state of New Jersey. PMC is a 355-bed non-profit, tertiary, and academic medical center. It is a major university hospital of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School of Rutgers University and has a helipad to handle transport critical patients from and to other hospitals via PennStar. The hospital was previously located in Princeton on Witherspoon Street until May 2012, when the new location opened off of U.S. Route 1 in Plainsboro. The new hospital was designed by a joint venture between HOK and RMJM Hiller.

Other nearby regional hospitals and healthcare networks that are accessible to Princeton include the Hamilton Township division and the New Brunswick division of Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital (RWJUH), along with Saint Peter&#x27;s University Hospital, also in New Brunswick. Princeton University&#x27;s Frist Campus Center was used for the aerial views of the fictional Princeton‑Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, as seen in the television series &quot;House&quot;.

==Princeton in popular culture==
===Film===
Princeton was the setting of the Academy Award-winning &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; about the schizophrenic mathematician John Nash. It was largely filmed in central New Jersey, including some Princeton locations. However, many scenes of &quot;Princeton&quot; were actually filmed at Fordham University&#x27;s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx.

The 1994 film &quot;I.Q.&quot;, featuring Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins, and Walter Matthau as Albert Einstein, was also set in Princeton and was filmed in the area. It includes some geographic stretches, including Matthau looking through a telescope from the roof of &quot;Princeton Hospital&quot; to see Ryan and Robbins&#x27; characters kissing on the Princeton Battlefield.

Historical films which used Princeton as a setting but were not filmed there include &quot;Wilson&quot;, a 1944 biographical film about Woodrow Wilson.

In his 1989 independent feature film &quot;Stage Fright,&quot; independent filmmaker Brad Mays shot a drama class scene in the Princeton High School auditorium, using PHS students as extras. On October 18, 2013, Mays&#x27; feature documentary &quot;I Grew Up in Princeton&quot; had its premiere showing at Princeton High School. The film, described in one Princeton newspaper as a &quot;deeply personal &#x27;coming-of-age story&#x27; that yields perspective on the role of perception in a town that was split racially, economically and sociologically&quot;, is a portrayal of life in the venerable university town during the tumultuous period of the late sixties through the early seventies.

Scenes from the beginning of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; (2007) were filmed on the Princeton University campus.

Parts of &quot;&quot; were filmed in Princeton. Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf were filming on Princeton University campus for two days during the summer of 2008.

George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; television series, a spin-off of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film franchise, showcases Princeton in three episodes. Princeton is the hometown of the main character, archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones, whose father, Henry Jones, Sr. is a university professor. Princeton features prominently in the episodes &quot;Spring Break Adventure&quot; and &quot;Winds of Change,&quot; though the Princeton scenes were actually filmed in Wilmington and Durham, North Carolina.

The TV show &quot;House&quot; was set in Princeton, at the fictional Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, and establishing shots for the hospital display the Frist Campus Center of Princeton University. The actual University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro opened on May 22, 2012, exactly one day after the finale of &quot;House&quot; aired.

<text>Periphas (; Ancient Greek: Περίφᾱς &quot;Períphās&quot; means &#x27;conspicuousness&#x27;) in Greek mythology may refer to:

*Periphas, a legendary king of Attica who Zeus turned into an eagle, husband of Phene.
*Periphas, an Egyptian prince as one of the sons of King Aegyptus. His mother was Gorgo and thus full brother of Oeneus, Aegyptus, Menalces, Lampus and Idmon. In some accounts, he could be a son of Aegyptus either by Eurryroe, daughter of the river-god Nilus, or Isaia, daughter of King Agenor of Tyre. Periphas suffered the same fate as his other brothers, save Lynceus, when they were slain on their wedding night by their wives who obeyed the command of their father King Danaus of Libya. He married the Danaid Actaea, daughter of Danaus and Pieria.
*Periphas, one of the five sons of Aretus who fought against Dionysus in the Indian War.
*Periphas, a Aetolian prince as son of King Oeneus of Calydon and Althaea, daughter of King Thestius of Pleuron. He was the brother of Meleager, Phereus, Ageleus, Toxeus, Clymenus, Gorge, Eurymede, Deianira and Melanippe.
*Periphas, a son of Lapithes and Orsinome in Thessaly. He consorted with Astyagyia, daughter of Hypseus, and had by her eight sons, of whom the eldest, Antion was a possible father of Ixion with Perimela.
*Periphas, one of the Lapiths at the wedding of Pirithous and Hippodamia. He must not be confused with the above-mentioned Periphas who was also a Lapith.
*Periphas, same as Hyperphas.
* Periphas, son of the Aetolian Ochesius, fell by the hand of Ares in the Trojan War.
* Periphas, a companion of Neoptolemus who took part in the destruction of Troy.
*Periphas, one of the sons of King Aeolus of Lipara, the keeper of the winds. He had five brothers namely: Agenor, Euchenor, Klymenos, Xouthos and Macareus, and six sisters: Klymene, Kallithyia, Eurygone, Lysidike, Kanake and an unnamed one. According to various accounts, Aeolus yoked in marriage his sons, including Periphas, and daughters in order to preserve concord and affection among them.
*Periphas, one of the Suitors of Penelope who came from Zacynthus along with other 43 wooers. He, with the other suitors, was shot dead by Odysseus with the aid of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*Periphas, a son of Epytus, and a herald of Aeneas.

<text>Periphetes (; Ancient Greek: Περιφήτης) is the name of several characters from Greek mythology.

* Periphetes, an Arcadian king as the son of Nyctimus, son of King Lycaon. He was the father of Parthaon, ancestor of Psophis, one of the possible eponyms for the city of Psophis.
* Periphetes, also known as [[Periphetes|Corynetes]] (Κορυνήτης) meaning Club-Bearer from the club (κορύνη) which he carried, was a son of Hephaestus and Anticleia or of Poseidon. Periphetes was lame (possibly in his feet, πόδας) like his father and used a bronze club as a crutch. He roamed the road from Athens to Troezen where he robbed travelers and killed them with his club. Theseus encountered and killed him near Epidauros (See Plutarch, Life of Theseus, et al.).
* Periphetes, son of Copreus; he was killed during the Trojan War by Hector.
* Periphetes, king of Mygdonia. He fought with Sithon for the hand of the latter&#x27;s daughter Pallene and was killed.
* Periphetes, a Trojan who was killed by Teucer.

== Other use ==

* Periphetes is a genus of Phasmatodea in the subfamily Lonchodinae.

<doc id="84664" wikidata="Q1235168" url="?curid=84664" title="Phemius">
<text>In Homer&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Phemius (; ), son of Terpes/Terpius, is an Ithacan poet who performs narrative songs in the house of the absent Odysseus.

== Mythology ==
Phemius&#x27;s audience is made up largely of the suitors of Penelope, who live in the house while attempting to persuade her to marry one of them. In Book 1 of the poem, Phemius performs at their request a version of the theme &quot;The Return from Troy&quot; (a theme that actually existed as a written poem, probably at a slightly later date). The performance is heard by Penelope. The story distresses her, since it is a reminder that her own husband has still not returned, and she emerges from her room to ask Phemius to choose a less painful theme. The proposal is overruled by her son Telemachus, because he thinks that a singer shouldn&#x27;t be forbidden to sing what his heart tells him to sing, and because it is Telemachus&#x27; right as householder to decide, not his mother&#x27;s.

We are told that Phemius performed for the suitors &quot;unwillingly&quot;, and so, towards the end of the poem, when all the suitors have been killed, Phemius pleads with Odysseus to spare his life, citing this very reason (among others) in his own defence: Telemachus confirms this, and Odysseus relents.

In Book 23, Odysseus instructs Phemius to perform wedding songs, &quot;as loud as his lyre can play&quot;, in order to delay news of the suitors&#x27; deaths from spreading until Odysseus and Telemachus can escape to their farm.

<text>In Greek mythology, Phereclus or Phereclos, son of Tecton, was the shipbuilder who constructed the boat that Paris used to kidnap Helen.

Meriones targeted Phereclos and killed him by ramming a spear into his right buttock. Phereclus was a target because he built Paris&#x27; ships, and he could make other contraptions of war.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer vividly illustrates Phereclus&#x27; death in book five:

<text>In Greek mythology, Phytalus (Ancient Greek: Φύταλος, &quot;Phútalos&quot;) was a hero and king of Attica who gave Demeter hospitality when she was searching for her daughter, Persephone. Demeter thanked Phytalus for his kindness by giving him a fig-tree. He was revered in Eleusis. His tomb was shown in the deme Lakidai near Cephisus.

Members of the clan Phytalidae, who claimed descent from Phytalus, were said to have cleansed Theseus of the murders he had committed on his way from Troezen to Athens and to have later been put in charge of the hero cult of Theseus in reward for their hospitality.

<text>In Greek mythology, Pisidice (, , &quot;Peisidíkē&quot;, &quot;to convince or persuade&quot;) or Peisidice was one of the following individuals:

* Pisidice, a Thessalian princess as the daughter of King Aeolus of Aeolia and Enarete, daughter of Deimachus. She was the sister of Salmoneus, Athamas, Sisyphus, Cretheus, Perieres, Deioneus, Magnes, Calyce, Canace, Alcyone and Perimede. Peisidice was the mother of Antiphus and Actor by Myrmidon. She may also be the mother of Myrmidon&#x27;s other children: Erysichthon, Dioplethes, Hiscilla and Eupolemeia.
* Pisidice, an alternate name for Demonice, mother of Thestius by Ares.
* Pisidice, a princess of Iolcus as the daughter of Pelias, who, together with her sisters, killed their father, as Medea tricked them into believing this was needed to rejuvenate him.
* Pisidice, a Pylian princess and daughter of King Nestor and Anaxibia or Eurydice. She was sister to Polycaste, Perseus, Stratichus, Aretus, Echephron, Pisistratus, Antilochus and Thrasymedes. She was probably the Pisidice who became the mother of Borus by Periclymenus, brother of Nestor and consequently her uncle.
* Pisidice of Methymna, a princess of Methymna, who fell in love with Achilles as he besieged her city, and promised to put Methymna into his possession if he would marry her. He agreed to her terms but, as soon as the city was his, he ordered that she be stoned to death as a traitor.
*Pisidice, a queen of Haliartus as wife of King Copreus. She was of royal descent as well as the daughter of King Leucon of Boeotia. By her husband, Pisidice became the mother of Hippoclus and Argynnos, who was loved by Agamemnon and drowned in River Cephissus.

<text>Faust (; ) is the protagonist of a classic German legend based on the historical Johann Georg Faust (). The erudite Faust is highly successful yet dissatisfied with his life, which leads him to make a deal with the Devil at a crossroads, exchanging his soul for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures. The Faust legend has been the basis for many literary, artistic, cinematic, and musical works that have reinterpreted it through the ages. &quot;Faust&quot; and the adjective &quot;Faustian&quot; imply sacrificing spiritual values for power, knowledge, or material gain.

The Faust of early books – as well as the ballads, dramas, movies, and puppet-plays which grew out of them – is irrevocably damned because he prefers human knowledge over divine knowledge: &quot;He laid the Holy Scriptures behind the door and under the bench, refused to be called doctor of theology, but preferred to be styled doctor of medicine&quot;. Plays and comic puppet theatre loosely based on this legend were popular throughout Germany in the 16th century, often reducing Faust and Mephistopheles to figures of vulgar fun. The story was popularised in England by Christopher Marlowe, who gave it a classic treatment in his play &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; ().
In Goethe&#x27;s reworking of the story over two hundred years later, Faust becomes a dissatisfied intellectual who yearns for &quot;more than earthly meat and drink&quot; in his life.

==Summary of the story==
Faust is unsatisfied with his life as a scholar and becomes depressed. After an attempt to take his own life, he calls on the Devil for further knowledge and magic powers with which to indulge all the pleasure and knowledge of the world. In response, the Devil&#x27;s representative, Mephistopheles, appears. He makes a bargain with Faust: Mephistopheles will serve Faust with his magic powers for a set number of years, but at the end of the term, the Devil will claim Faust&#x27;s soul, and Faust will be eternally enslaved.

During the term of the bargain, Faust makes use of Mephistopheles in various ways. In Goethe&#x27;s drama, and many subsequent versions of the story, Mephistopheles helps Faust seduce a beautiful and innocent young woman, usually named Gretchen, whose life is ultimately destroyed when she gives birth to Faust&#x27;s illegitimate son. Realizing this unholy act, she drowns the child and is sentenced to death for murder. However, Gretchen&#x27;s innocence saves her in the end, and she enters Heaven. In Goethe&#x27;s rendition, Faust is saved by God via his constant striving – in combination with Gretchen&#x27;s pleadings with God in the form of the eternal feminine. However, in the early versions of the tale, Faust is irrevocably corrupted and believes his sins cannot be forgiven; when the term ends, the Devil carries him off to Hell.

==Sources==
The tale of Faust bears many similarities to the Theophilus legend recorded in the 13th century writer Gautier de Coincy&#x27;s &quot;Les Miracles de la Sainte Vierge&quot;. Here, a saintly figure makes a bargain with the keeper of the infernal world but is rescued from paying his debt to society through the mercy of the Blessed Virgin. A depiction of the scene in which he subordinates himself to the Devil appears on the north tympanum of the Cathedrale de Notre Dame de Paris.

The origin of Faust&#x27;s name and persona remains unclear. In the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;, Faustus is the offspring of an incestuous marriage between king Vortigern and Vortigern&#x27;s own daughter. 

The character is ostensibly based on Johann Georg Faust (), a magician and alchemist probably from Knittlingen, Württemberg, who obtained a degree in divinity from Heidelberg University in 1509, but the legendary Faust has also been connected with an earlier Johann Fust (), Johann Gutenberg&#x27;s business partner,
which suggests that Fust is one of the multiple origins to the Faust story.
Scholars such as Frank Baron
and Ruickbie (2009)
contests many of these previous assumptions.

The character in Polish folklore named Pan Twardowski (Sir Twardowski in English) presents similarities with Faust. The Polish story seems to have originated at roughly the same time as its German counterpart, yet it is unclear whether the two tales have a common origin or influenced each other. The historical Johann Georg Faust had studied in Kraków for a time and may have served as the inspiration for the character in the Polish legend.

The first known printed source of the legend of Faust is a small chapbook bearing the title &quot;Historia von D. Johann Fausten&quot;, published in 1587. The book was re-edited and borrowed from throughout the 16th century. Other similar books of that period include:
* &quot;Das Wagnerbuch&quot; (1593)
* &quot;Das Widmann&#x27;sche Faustbuch&quot; (1599)
* &quot;Dr. Fausts großer und gewaltiger Höllenzwang&quot; (Frankfurt 1609)
* &quot;Dr. Johannes Faust, Magia naturalis et innaturalis&quot; (Passau 1612)
* &quot;Das Pfitzer&#x27;sche Faustbuch&quot; (1674)
* &quot;Dr. Fausts großer und gewaltiger Meergeist&quot; (Amsterdam 1692)
* &quot;Das Wagnerbuch&quot; (1714)
* &quot;Faustbuch des Christlich Meynenden&quot; (1725)

The 1725 Faust chapbook was widely circulated and also read by the young Goethe.

Related tales about a pact between man and the Devil include the plays &quot;Mariken van Nieumeghen&quot; (Dutch, early 16th century, author unknown), &quot;Cenodoxus&quot; (German, early 17th century, by Jacob Bidermann) and The Countess Cathleen (Irish legend of unknown origin believed by some to be taken from the French play &quot;Les marchands d&#x27;âmes&quot;).

==Locations linked to the story==
Staufen, a town in the extreme southwest of Germany, claims to be where Faust died (); depictions appear on buildings, etc. The only historical source for this tradition is a passage in the &quot;Chronik der Grafen von Zimmern&quot;, which was written , 25 years after Faust&#x27;s presumed death. These chronicles are generally considered reliable, and in the 16th century there were still family ties between the lords of Staufen and the counts of Zimmern in nearby Donaueschingen.

In Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s original telling of the tale, Wittenburg—where Faust studied—was also written as Wertenberge. This has led to a measure of speculation as to precisely where his story is set. Some scholars suggest the Duchy of Württemberg; others suggest an allusion to Marlowe&#x27;s own Cambridge (Gill, 2008, p. 5)

==Literary adaptations==

===Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;===
The early Faust chapbook, while in circulation in northern Germany, found its way to England, where in 1592 an English translation was published, &quot;The Historie of the Damnable Life, and Deserved Death of Doctor Iohn Faustus&quot; credited to a certain &quot;P. F., Gent[leman]&quot;. Christopher Marlowe used this work as the basis for his more ambitious play, &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; (published ). Marlowe also borrowed from John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot;, on the exchanges between Pope Adrian VI and a rival pope.

===Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;===

Another important version of the legend is the play &quot;Faust,&quot; written by the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The First Part, which is the one more closely connected to the earlier legend, was published in 1808, the Second appeared posthumously in 1832.

Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; complicates the simple Christian moral of the original legend. A hybrid between a play and an extended poem, Goethe&#x27;s two-part &quot;closet drama&quot; is epic in scope. It gathers together references from Christian, medieval, Roman, eastern, and Hellenic poetry, philosophy, and literature.

The composition and refinement of Goethe&#x27;s own version of the legend occupied him, off and on, for over sixty years. The final version, published after his death, is recognized as a great work of German literature.

The story concerns the fate of Faust in his quest for the true essence of life (&quot;&quot;). Frustrated with learning and the limits to his knowledge, power, and enjoyment of life, he attracts the attention of the Devil (represented by Mephistopheles), who makes a bet with Faust that he will be able to satisfy him. Faust is reluctant, believing this will never happen. This is a significant difference between Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Marlowe&#x27;s; Faust is not the one who suggests the wager.

In the first part, Mephistopheles leads Faust through experiences that culminate in a lustful relationship with Gretchen, an innocent young woman. Gretchen and her family are destroyed by Mephistopheles&#x27; deceptions and Faust&#x27;s desires. Part one of the story ends in tragedy for Faust, as Gretchen is saved but Faust is left to grieve in shame.

The second part begins with the spirits of the earth forgiving Faust (and the rest of mankind) and progresses into allegorical poetry. Faust and his Devil pass through and manipulate the world of politics and the world of the classical gods, and meet with Helen of Troy (the personification of beauty). Finally, in anticipation of having tamed the forces of war and nature and created a place for a free people to live, Faust is happy and dies.

Mephistopheles tries to seize Faust&#x27;s soul when he dies after this moment of happiness, but is frustrated and enraged when angels intervene due to God&#x27;s grace. Though this grace is &#x27;gratuitous&#x27; and does not condone Faust&#x27;s frequent errors with Mephistopheles, the angels state that this grace can only occur because of Faust&#x27;s unending striving and due to the intercession of the forgiving Gretchen. The final scene has Faust&#x27;s soul carried to Heaven in the presence of God by the intercession of the &quot;Virgin, Mother, Queen, ... Goddess kind forever ... Eternal Womanhood&quot;. The woman is thus victorious over Mephistopheles, who had insisted at Faust&#x27;s death that he would be consigned to &quot;The Eternal Empty&quot;.

===Mann&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;===
Thomas Mann&#x27;s 1947 &quot;&quot; adapts the Faust legend to a 20th century context, documenting the life of fictional composer Adrian Leverkühn, as analog and embodiment of the early 20th century history of Germany and of Europe. The talented Leverkühn, after contracting venereal disease from a brothel visit, forms a pact with a Mephistophelean character to grant him 24 years of brilliance and success as a composer. He produces works of increasing beauty to universal acclaim, even while physical illness begins to corrupt his body. In 1930, when presenting his final masterwork (&quot;The Lamentation of Dr. Faust&quot;), he confesses the pact he had made: Madness and syphilis now overcome him, and he suffers a slow and total collapse until his death in 1940. Leverkühn&#x27;s spiritual, mental, and physical collapse and degradation are mapped on to the period in which Nazism rose in Germany, and Leverkühn&#x27;s fate is shown as that of the soul of Germany.

===Benét&#x27;s &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;===

Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s short story &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; published in 1937 is a retelling of the tale of Faust based on the short story &quot;The Devil and Tom Walker&quot;, written by Washington Irving. Benet&#x27;s version of the story centers on a New Hampshire farmer by the name of Jabez Stone who, plagued with unending bad luck, is approached by the devil under the name of Mr. Scratch who offers him seven years of prosperity in exchange for his soul. Jabez Stone is eventually defended by Daniel Webster, a fictional version of the famous lawyer and orator, in front of a judge and jury of the damned, and his case is won. It was adapted in 1941 as a movie, &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot;, with Walter Huston as the devil, James Craig as Jabez and Edward Arnold as Webster. It was remade in 2007 as &quot;Shortcut to Happiness&quot; with Alec Baldwin as Jabez, Anthony Hopkins as Webster and Jennifer Love Hewitt as the Devil.

=== Murnau&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; ===
F.W. Murnau, director of the classic &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, directed a silent version of &quot;Faust&quot; that premiered in 1926. Murnau&#x27;s film featured special effects that were remarkable for the era. In one scene, Mephisto towers over a town, dark wings spread wide, as a fog rolls in bringing the plague. In another, an extended montage sequence shows Faust, mounted behind Mephisto, riding through the heavens, and the camera view, effectively swooping through quickly changing panoramic backgrounds, courses past snowy mountains, high promontories and cliffs, and waterfalls.

In the Murnau version of the tale, the aging bearded scholar and alchemist is disillusioned by the palpable failure of his supposed cure for a plague that has stricken his town. Faust renounces his many years of hard travail and studies in alchemy. In his despair, he hauls all his bound volumes by armloads onto a growing pyre, intending to burn them. However, a wind turns over a few cabalistic leaves, and one of the books&#x27; pages catches Faust&#x27;s eye. Their words contain a prescription for how to invoke the dreadful dark forces.

Faust heeds these recipes and begins enacting the mystic protocols: On a hill, alone, summoning Mephisto, certain forces begin to convene, and Faust in a state of growing trepidation hesitates, and begins to withdraw; he flees along a winding, twisting pathway, returning to his study chambers. At pauses along this retreat, though, he meets a reappearing figure. Each time, it doffs its hat in a greeting that is Mephisto confronting him. Mephisto overcomes Faust&#x27;s reluctance to sign a long binding pact with the invitation that Faust may try on these powers, just for one day, and without obligation to longer terms. Upon the end of that day, the sands of twenty-four hours having run out, after Faust&#x27;s having been restored to youth and, helped by his servant Mephisto to steal a beautiful woman from her wedding feast, Faust is tempted so much that he agrees to sign a pact for eternity (which is to say when, in due course, his time runs out). Eventually Faust becomes bored with the pursuit of pleasure and returns home, where he falls in love with the beautiful and innocent Gretchen. His corruption (enabled, or embodied, through the forms of Mephisto) ultimately ruins both their lives, though there is still a chance for redemption in the end.

Similarities to Goethe&#x27;s Faust include the classic tale of a man who sold his soul to the Devil, the same Mephisto wagering with an angel to corrupt the soul of Faust, the plague sent by Mephisto on Faust&#x27;s small town, and the familiar cliffhanger with Faust unable to find a cure for the Plague, and therefore turning to Mephisto, renouncing God, the angel, and science alike.

==In psychotherapy==
Psychodynamic therapy uses the idea of a Faustian bargain to explain defence mechanisms, usually rooted in childhood, that sacrifice elements of the self in favor of some form of psychological survival. For the neurotic, abandoning one&#x27;s genuine feeling self in favour of a false self more amenable to caretakers may offer a viable form of life, but at the expense of one&#x27;s true emotions and affects. For the psychotic, a Faustian bargain with an omnipotent-self can offer the imaginary refuge of a psychic retreat at the price of living in unreality.

<doc id="84674" wikidata="Q2587481" url="?curid=84674" title="Planctae">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Planctae (, &quot;Planktai&quot;, &quot;Wanderers&quot;), also known as Wandering Rocks, were a group of rocks, between which the sea was mercilessly violent. The Argo (led by Jason) was the only ship to navigate them successfully (with divine help from Hera, Thetis, and the Nereids). Jason chose to brave the Planctae instead of braving Scylla and Charybdis.

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; of Homer, the sorceress Circe tells Odysseus of the &quot;Wandering Rocks&quot; or &quot;Roving Rocks&quot; that have only been successfully passed by the &quot;Argo&quot; when &quot;homeward&quot; bound. These rocks smash ships and the remaining timbers are scattered by the sea or destroyed by flames. The rocks lie on one of two potential routes to Ithaca; the alternative, which is taken by Odysseus, leads to Scylla and Charybdis. Furthermore, in the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, it was Hera, for her love of Jason, who sped the Argo through the Symplegades safely.

The rocks also appear on the journey in the &quot;Argonautica&quot; by Apollonius of Rhodes, who also locates them near Scylla and Charybdis, but beyond them rather than as an alternative route. Apollonius distinguishes between two sets of dangerous rocks, the Symplegades and the Planctae. The Symplegades were encountered on the way to the Golden Fleece and the Planctae were encountered on the return voyage. Which god or goddess helped the Argonauts safely sail through the Clashing Rocks is unclear in the text. Athena helped in the former task, while Thetis and her sisters the Nereids helped in the latter one. However, the plans to help Jason pass these obstacles were ultimately orchestrated by Hera according to Apollonius, thus agreeing with Homer.

The similarities and differences between the Wandering Rocks and the Symplegades has been much debated by scholars, as have potential locations for them. (See also &quot;Geography of the Odyssey&quot;.) As Scylla and Charybdis have often been located in the Straits of Messina, this has led some (like E. V. Rieu) to suggest the Wandering Rocks were located around Sicily, with their flames and smoke coming from Mount Etna. An alternative theory of the geography of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; places Circe, the Sirens, Scylla &amp; Charybdis and the Wandering Rocks, all mentioned in the stories of both Jason and Odysseus, in northwest Greece. Tim Severin noted that the island of Sesola off the coast of Lefkada looked very similar to the rocks from the Argo story, and also that the area is near a geological fault; he hypothesises that, due to both its similarity with the legends of the Symplegades and the stories of the &quot;Argo&quot; sailing home via the Adriatic and Ionian Seas, the original legend was copied to the area. Severin also supports his theory with locations for Scylla and Charybdis being located on the other side of Levkas, noting that the name &quot;Cape Skilla&quot; is still used for a nearby headland on the mainland.

<text>In Greek mythology, Podarces () was a son of Iphiclus (son of Phylacus, founder of Phylace) by Diomedeia and the brother of Protesilaus. In some accounts, he and his brother were called the sons of Phylacus and Astyoche instead.

== Mythology ==
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Podarces and Protesilaus were former suitors of Helen, and therefore bound to defend the marriage rights of Menelaus, her husband, when Helen was kidnapped by Paris. After Protesilaus was killed by Hector, Podarces led the Phylacian troops in the Trojan War, on the side of the Greeks. According to the &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, by Quintus of Smyrna, he was killed by Penthesilea, the Queen of the Amazons.

== Namesake ==
Podarces was also the original name of Priam, king of Troy.

<text>In Greek mythology, Poeas, or Poias (Ancient Greek: Ποίας) was a king of Meliboea or Malis (Maleae) and one of the Argonauts.

== Family ==
Poeas was the son of King Thaumacus of Thaumacia and the father of the hero Philoctetes by Methone.

== Mythology ==
As an Argonaut, Poeas is identified as the greatest archer of the group. When facing the giant Talos, some accounts say Medea drugged the bronze giant and Poeas shot an arrow to poison him in his heel. Other sources cited his son Philoctetes as one of the Argonauts instead of him.

More famously, Poeas had a role in the apotheosis of Heracles, his friend. When Heracles realized he was dying from poisonous centaur blood he demanded a funeral pyre built and lit once he stood atop it. As none of his own men would light the pyre, a passer-by (Poeas) was asked by Heracles to light it. In return for this favor Heracles bestowed his famed bow and poison arrows upon Poeas. Other versions, had Philoctetes as the passer-by or that Poeas assigned Philoctetes the task.

<text>In Greek mythology, Polites (), the friend of Odysseus, was a minor character in the epics by Homer.

== Mythology ==
Polites was a member of Odysseus&#x27;s crew. Odysseus refers to him as his dearest friend, though he is only mentioned twice. It is unclear whether he was killed by Scylla or by the lightning bolt that Zeus hurled at Odysseus&#x27;s ship.

Polites features more prominently in some versions of the folk tale known as The Hero of Temesa, which recounts the tale of one of Odysseus&#x27;s crew (in some sources unnamed, but in others, including in the retelling by Strabo, identified as Polities) who was killed on the island of Temesa and returned as a vengeful ghost. Various sources give different accounts of the death—some say he was stoned after raping a woman, others simply claim he was murdered by the locals—but in all versions, the ghost threatened the populace and extracted a high tribute in exchange for a more peaceful coexistence until he was defeated by a visitor to the island, sometimes identified as Euthymus of Locri, a boxer and Olympic victor. Because the ghost is sometimes described as wearing a wolfskin, scholar David Odgen speculates that &quot;we are probably dealing with a monster that is mixanthropic: partly human and partly animal, a wolf-man...&quot; and thus an early classical example of a werewolf story.

<text>In Greek mythology, Polydamas (; Ancient Greek: Πολυδάμας, gen. Πολυδάμαντος, &quot;Polydámas&quot;, &quot;Polydámantos&quot;) was a lieutenant and friend of Hector during the Trojan War. 

== Family ==
Polydamas was the son of Panthous, one of the Trojan elders and Phrontis. He was the father of Leocritus who was killed by Odysseus.

== Mythology ==
During the battles described in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, he often proposes a cautious battle strategy which is sometimes accepted but more often refused by Hector, who prefers direct attack. In Book XII, he prefers retreat in the face of the omen of an eagle. Hector defies this and presses forth anyway. However, Hector does take his advice to regroup in Book XIII, after the Argives have done tremendous damage to the Trojans. In Book XVIII of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Polydamas advises the Trojans to retire from the battlefield after the death of Patroclus. Hector, however, overrules Polydamas, leaving the army in the field when Achilles ends his feud with Agamemnon and rejoins the Achaean forces. As a result, Achilles kills a great number of Trojan warriors, culminating in a duel with Hector in which the latter is killed.

Polydamas appears periodically throughout the battles, and brags about killing Prothoënor. He often complements Hector in battle. In Book XV, after killing Mecistus and Otus, he is attacked by Meges, but Apollo saves him, causing him to dodge at the last moment. Polydamas killed three Greeks in the war.

Homer gives no foreshadowing of Polydamas&#x27;s final fate, nor is he mentioned in most of the later poems dealing with the aftermath of the war, leaving the reader to infer that he perished in the general slaughter after the fall of Troy to the Greek forces. 

He is mentioned in Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27; &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, but again, no death is mentioned. In Quintus Smyrneaus&#x27; story, Polydamas actually suggests that instead of attacking or fleeing, the Trojans should just give Helen back to the Greeks. This suggestion is well received by many soldiers, but nobody admits it. Paris calls him a deserter and a coward, but Polydamas retorts that Paris&#x27; ambitions instigated the problem. Later on, he tries again to persuade the Trojans to stay inside the city in order to raise troop morale, but it is Aeneas that opposes his opinion this time, on the grounds that the Greeks will not be disheartened by a long stay inside the walls.

<text>Polydora (; in Attic and in Ionic, means &#x27;many-gifts&#x27; or &#x27;the shapely&#x27;) was the name of several characters in Greek mythology:

*Polydora, the &#x27;handsome&#x27; Oceanid, one of the 3,000 water-nymph daughters of the Titans Oceanus and his sister-spouse Tethys.
*Polydora, a nymph and one of the 50 Danaïdes, daughter of King Danaus. She was the mother of King Dryops of Oeta, by the river-gods Spercheus or Peneus.
*Polydora, wife of Aphareus of Messenia and thus, the possible mother of his children, Idas, Lynceus and Peisus. In some accounts, the consort of Aphareus was called Arene or Laocoosa.
*Polydora, daughter of Peleus and Antigone, daughter of King Eurytion of Phthia. She married Borus, son of Perieres, who wooed her with large dowry, but regardless of this, Polydora became the mother of Menesthius by Spercheios.
*Polydora, daughter of Perieres and wife of Peleus. In some accounts, she became the mother of Menesthius by Spercheus.
*Polydora, daughter of Meleager and Cleopatra. She was married to Protesilaus, and after his death she was so affected by grief that she took her own life.
*Polydora, one of the Amazons.

<text>In Greek mythology, Perigune () was the daughter of Sinis. Her name is also spelled Perigouna or Perigone. She is passingly mentioned as Perigenia in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

== Mythology ==
Perigune is mentioned in only a few sources and the details are sparse. The most extensive surviving account comes from Plutarch, who states that, after Theseus killed her father, she hid herself in a bed of rushes and asparagus. When Theseus promised not to harm her, she emerged from hiding. She then bore Theseus Melanippus, who became the ancestor of the Ioxides of Caria. These people, Plutarch states, revered the asparagus and the rush and did not burn them. Afterwards Theseus gave her to Deioneus of Oechalia. 

Pausanias also mentions that Theseus fathered Melanippus with the daughter of Sinis, but gives no further details. In the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; of Athenaeus she – again referred to only as the daughter of Sinis – is listed as one of the women taken by Theseus by force. Athenaeus cites the fourteenth book of Istrus&#x27;s &quot;Attika&quot; as the source of the information.

<text>In Greek mythology, Procrustes (; Greek: Προκρούστης &quot;Prokroustes&quot;, &quot;the stretcher [who hammers out the metal]&quot;), also known as Prokoptas, Damastes (Δαμαστής, &quot;subduer&quot;) or Polypemon, was a rogue smith and bandit from Attica who attacked people by stretching them or cutting off their legs, so as to force them to fit the size of an iron bed.

The word Procrustean is thus used by analogy to describe, for example, situations where an arbitrary standard is used to measure success, while completely disregarding obvious harm that results from the effort.

== Family ==
Procrustes was a son of Poseidon while his mother was unknown. Procrustes had a son named Sinis, by Sylea (daughter of Corinthus), who, just as his father, came to be another malefactor captured and killed by Theseus.

==Mythology==
Procrustes had a stronghold on Mount Korydallos at Erineus, on the sacred way between Athens and Eleusis. There he had a bed, in which he invited every passer-by to spend the night, and where he set to work on them with his smith&#x27;s hammer, to stretch them to fit. In later tellings, if the guest proved too tall, Procrustes would amputate the excess length; if the guest was too short Procrustes would stretch them until they died; nobody ever fit the bed exactly. Procrustes continued his reign of terror until he was captured by Theseus, travelling to Athens along the sacred way, who &quot;fitted&quot; Procrustes to his own bed:

He killed Damastes, surnamed Procrustes, by compelling him to make his own body fit his bed, as he had been wont to do with those of strangers. And he did this in imitation of Heracles. For that hero punished those who offered him violence in the manner in which they had plotted to serve him.

Killing Procrustes was Theseus&#x27;s last adventure on his journey from Troezen to Athens.

==Cultural references==
A Procrustean bed is an arbitrary standard to which exact conformity is forced.
* In Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s influential crime story &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; (1844), the private detective Dupin uses the metaphor of a Procrustean bed to describe the Parisian police&#x27;s overly rigid method of looking for clues.
* French philosopher Jacques Derrida, in &quot;The Purveyor of Truth&quot;, his response to Jacques Lacan&#x27;s seminar on &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; (1956), applies the metaphor to the structural analysis of texts: &quot;By framing in this violent way, by cutting the narrated figure itself from a fourth side in order to see only triangles, one evades perhaps a certain complication.&quot; This is one of deconstruction&#x27;s central critiques of structural (and formal) literary analysis. Slavoj Žižek draws upon the metaphor to critique poetic form: &quot;The most elementary form of torturing one&#x27;s language is called poetry—think of what a complex form like a sonnet does to language: it forces the free flow of speech into a Procrustean bed of fixed forms of rhythm and rhyme.&quot; Poet Hollis Robbins draws upon the metaphor to structure a sonnet about cutting lines to fit meter and rhyme.
*Thomas Jefferson used the Procrustean bed as a metaphor in a paper on religious freedom. &quot;Reason and experiment have been indulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inquisitor? Fallible men; men governed by bad passions, by private as well as public reasons. And why subjected to coercion? To produce uniformity. But is uniformativity desirable? Introduce the bed of Procrustus then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the small, make us all of a size, by lopping the former and stretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion.&quot;
*The Talmud uses this concept to understand the sins of the people of Sodom, Sanhedrin 109b 5 says: &quot;The Gemara continues to discuss the sins of the people of Sodom: They had beds on which they would lay their guests; when a guest was longer than the bed they would cut him, and when a guest was shorter than the bed they would stretch him.&quot;
*The concept of the Procrustean bed has been invoked by Eurosceptics to describe the relationship between the Eurozone and its member states.
* Theodosius Dobzhansky, a founding figure in evolutionary biology and genetics, wrote &quot;Progress of scientific understanding is often obstructed and side-tracked when a working hypothesis which proves serviceable in a certain field is used as a Procrustean bed to mutilate the evidence derived from other fields.&quot; Dobzhansky made this chiding statement in response to claims that certain biological phenomena could only arise via one mechanism.
* The Austrian-American writer Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn&#x27;s 1943 book &quot;The Menace of the Herd, or Procrustes at Large&quot; is a critique of what the author describes as the negative effects of egalitarianism as a political philosophy, where state power is used to force individuals to fit the standards designed by politicians and intellectuals.
* In a poem &quot;Damastes (Also Known as Procrustes) Speaks&quot; (&quot;Damastes z przydomkiem Prokustes mówi&quot;) Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert shows an analogy between &#x27;fitting&#x27; people to the bed of Procrustes and totalitarian regimes of 20th century trying to create a &#x27;new man&#x27; that will be subordinate to their authority.
* &quot;The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms&quot; is a 2010 book by philosopher and probability theorist Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of &quot;The Black Swan&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Giving continuation to this idea, in Antifragile, the author uses the image of the Procrustean bed as an allegory to modernity, linking it to present-day man&#x27;s fear of randomness.
* Procrustes analysis is the process of performing a shape-preserving Euclidean transformation to a set of shapes. This removes variations in translation, rotation and scaling across the dataset in order to move them into a common frame of reference. This is generally the precursor to further statistical analysis. A related problem in linear algebra is the orthogonal Procrustes problem of finding the closest orthogonal matrix to any given matrix.
* A Procrustean solution is the undesirable practice of tailoring data to fit its container or some other preconceived structure. In a Procrustean solution in statistics, instead of finding the best fit line to a scatter plot of data, one first chooses the line one wants, then selects only the data that fits it, disregarding data that does not, so to &quot;prove&quot; some idea. It is a form of rhetorical deception made to forward one set of interests at the expense of others. The unique goal of the Procrustean solution is not win-win, but rather that Procrustes wins and the other loses. In this case, the defeat of the opponent justifies the deceptive means.
* The term &quot;procrusticism&quot; appears in the novel Eden by Polish science fiction writer Stanisław Lem, where it denotes the forced adaptation of the entire society of the planet to doctrinal, quasi-religious (including biological) models.
* In computer science, a Procrustean string is a fixed length string into which strings of varying lengths are placed. If the string inserted is too short, then it is padded out, usually with spaces or null characters. If the string inserted is too long, it is truncated. The concept is mentioned in the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum user manuals, where a portion of a string is replaced by another string using Procrustean assignment—the replacement string is truncated or padded in order to have length equal to the portion being replaced. Such an assignment is also sometimes referred to as Procrustean formatting. Although the term did not catch on in wider usage, it appears in some references, notably FOLDOC.
* The film editor Walter Murch refers, not entirely negatively, to a certain style of film editing as &quot;procrustean&quot;. If the first assembly of a film is too long by a certain amount, that amount is removed quickly, sometimes brutally. Then the film is viewed at this new length, and progress afterwards is aimed at smoothing out the amputations without adding length. Similarly, Vince Gilligan alludes to the Procrustean bed when stating that each episode of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; had to be edited to a length of exactly 47 minutes, 7 seconds, and 4 frames.
* Procrustes appears in the &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians&quot; book &quot;The Lightning Thief&quot;. This version is depicted as a half-giant who is a water bed salesman. He also appeared in the Disney+ fantasy show &quot;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&quot;, played by Julian Richings (who also played Charon in &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lighting Thief&quot;). The main difference is that the heroes decided to spare him, unlike the book.
* The legend of Procrustes figures prominently in Malayalam literature, beginning with the highly acclaimed poem titled eponymously &quot;Procrustes&quot; by Vayalar Ramavarma.
* &quot;Patul lui Procust&quot; (&quot;The Bed of Procrustes&quot;) is a novel by Romanian author Camil Petrescu.
* &quot;Sleepless Nights in the Procrustean Bed&quot; is a collection of essays by Harlan Ellison.
*In A. F. Th. van der Heijden&#x27;s novel &quot;Het Schervengericht&quot; (&quot;Jugement by shards&quot;) Procrustes&#x27; bed is used as a symbol for the strict standards of the society.
*In Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;, John Joel Glanton, a filibuster and scalp collector who has taken control of the Yuma Ferry by means of violence, is described as imposing a &quot;procrustean&quot; toll on his clients wherein &quot;the fares were tailored to accommodate the purses of the travelers&quot;. The meaning here denotes how Glanton and his men would not ferry any customer until they had surrendered all of their money and goods, leaving them entirely destitute.
*The Mexican stop-motion animated series &quot;Frankelda&#x27;s Book of Spooks&quot; features a spidery villain named Procustes, being the nightmare kingdom&#x27;s royal writer who refuses to accept the shortcomings of his work in a changing world and imprisons the soul of Frankelda, a female horror writer defying the standards and expectations placed on her in 1870s Mexico, within his slumbering mind.

<text>The University of Paris (), known metonymically as the Sorbonne (), was the leading university in Paris, France, from 1150 to 1970, except for 1793–1806 during the French Revolution. Emerging around 1150 as a corporation associated with the cathedral school of Paris, it was considered the second-oldest university in Europe. Officially chartered in 1200 by King Philip II and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was nicknamed after its theological College of Sorbonne, founded by Robert de Sorbon and chartered by King Louis IX around 1257.

Highly reputed internationally for its academic performance in the humanities ever since the Middle Ages – particularly in theology and philosophy – it introduced academic standards and traditions that have endured and spread, such as doctoral degrees and student nations. Notable popes, royalty, scientists, and intellectuals were educated at the University of Paris. A few of the colleges of the time are still visible close to the Panthéon and Jardin du Luxembourg: Collège des Bernardins (18 rue de Poissy, 5th arr.), Hôtel de Cluny (6 Place Paul Painlevé, 5th arr.), Collège Sainte-Barbe (4 rue Valette, 5th arr.), Collège d&#x27;Harcourt (44 Boulevard Saint-Michel, 6th arr.), and Cordeliers (21 rue École de Médecine, 6th arr.).

In 1793, during the French Revolution, the university was closed and, by Item 27 of the Revolutionary Convention, the college endowments and buildings were sold. A new University of France replaced it in 1806 with four independent faculties: the Faculty of Humanities (), the Faculty of Law (later including Economics), the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology (closed in 1885).

In 1896, a new University of Paris was re-founded as a grouping of the Paris faculties of science, literature, law, medicine, Protestant theology and the École supérieure de pharmacie de Paris. It was inaugurated on November 19, 1896, by French President Félix Faure. In 1970, after the civil unrest of May 1968, the university was divided into 13 autonomous universities, which today are the Sorbonne University, Panthéon-Sorbonne University, the Assas University, the Sorbonne Nouvelle University, the Paris Cité University, the PSL University, the Saclay University, the Nanterre University, the Sorbonne Paris North University, the Paris-East Créteil University and the Paris 8 University. The Chancellerie des Universités de Paris inherited the heritage assets of the University of Paris, including the Sorbonne building, the &quot;La Sorbonne&quot; brand, control of the inter-university libraries, and management of the staff of the Paris universities (until 2007).

== History ==

===Origins===
In 1150, the future University of Paris was a student-teacher corporation operating as an annex of the cathedral school of Paris. The earliest historical reference to it is found in Matthew Paris&#x27;s reference to the studies of his own teacher (an abbot of St Albans) and his acceptance into &quot;the fellowship of the elect Masters&quot; there in about 1170, and it is known that Lotario dei Conti di Segni, the future Pope Innocent III, completed his studies there in 1182 at the age of 21. Its first college was the Collège des Dix-Huit, established in 1180 by an Englishman named Josse and endowed for 18 poor scholars. 

The corporation was formally recognised as an &quot;&quot; in an edict by King Philippe-Auguste in 1200: in it, among other accommodations granted to future students, he allowed the corporation to operate under ecclesiastic law which would be governed by the elders of the Notre-Dame Cathedral school, and assured all those completing courses there that they would be granted a diploma.

The university had four faculties: Arts, Medicine, Law, and Theology. The Faculty of Arts was the lowest in rank, but also the largest, as students had to graduate there in order to be admitted to one of the higher faculties. The students were divided into four &quot;nationes&quot; according to language or regional origin: France, Normandy, Picardy, and England. The last came to be known as the &quot;Alemannian&quot; (German) nation. Recruitment to each nation was wider than the names might imply: the English–German nation included students from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.

The faculty and nation system of the University of Paris (along with that of the University of Bologna) became the model for all later medieval universities. Under the governance of the Church, students wore robes and shaved the tops of their heads in tonsure, to signify they were under the protection of the church. Students followed the rules and laws of the Church and were not subject to the king&#x27;s laws or courts. This presented problems for the city of Paris, as students ran wild, and its official had to appeal to Church courts for justice. Students were often very young, entering the school at 13 or 14 years of age and staying for six to 12 years.
===12th century: Organisation===
Three schools were especially famous in Paris: the &quot;palatine or palace school&quot;, the &quot;school of Notre-Dame&quot;, and that of Sainte-Geneviève Abbey. The latter two, although ancient, were initially eclipsed by the palatine school, until the decline of royalty brought about its decline.

The first renowned professor at the school of Ste-Geneviève was Hubold, who lived in the tenth century. Not content with the courses at Liège, he continued his studies at Paris, entered or allied himself with the chapter of Ste-Geneviève, and attracted many pupils via his teaching. Distinguished professors from the school of Notre-Dame in the eleventh century include Lambert, disciple of Fulbert of Chartres; Drogo of Paris; Manegold of Germany; and Anselm of Laon. These two schools attracted scholars from every country and produced many illustrious men, among whom were: St. Stanislaus of Szczepanów, Bishop of Kraków; Gebbard, Archbishop of Salzburg; St. Stephen, third Abbot of Cîteaux; Robert d&#x27;Arbrissel, founder of the Abbey of Fontevrault etc. Three other men who added prestige to the schools of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève were William of Champeaux, Abélard, and Peter Lombard.

Humanistic instruction comprised grammar, rhetoric, dialectics, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy (trivium and quadrivium). To the higher instruction belonged dogmatic and moral theology, whose source was the Scriptures and the Patristic Fathers. It was completed by the study of Canon law. The School of Saint-Victor arose to rival those of Notre-Dame and Ste-Geneviève. It was founded by William of Champeaux when he withdrew to the Abbey of Saint-Victor. Its most famous professors are Hugh of St. Victor and Richard of St. Victor.

The plan of studies expanded in the schools of Paris, as it did elsewhere. A Bolognese compendium of canon law called the brought about a division of the theology department. Hitherto the discipline of the Church had not been separate from so-called theology; they were studied together under the same professor. But this vast collection necessitated a special course, which was undertaken first at Bologna, where Roman law was taught. In France, first Orléans and then Paris erected chairs of canon law. Before the end of the twelfth century, the Decretals of Gerard La Pucelle, Mathieu d&#x27;Angers, and Anselm (or Anselle) of Paris, were added to the Decretum Gratiani. However, civil law was not included at Paris. In the twelfth century, medicine began to be publicly taught at Paris: the first professor of medicine in Paris records is Hugo, &quot;physicus excellens qui quadrivium docuit&quot;.

Professors were required to have measurable knowledge and be appointed by the university. Applicants had to be assessed by examination; if successful, the examiner, who was the head of the school, and known as &quot;scholasticus&quot;, &quot;capiscol&quot;, and &quot;chancellor,&quot; appointed an individual to teach. This was called the licence or faculty to teach. The licence had to be granted freely. No one could teach without it; on the other hand, the examiner could not refuse to award it when the applicant deserved it.
The school of Saint-Victor, under the abbey, conferred the licence in its own right; the school of Notre-Dame depended on the diocese, that of Ste-Geneviève on the abbey or chapter. The diocese and the abbey or chapter, through their chancellor, gave professorial investiture in their respective territories where they had jurisdiction. Besides Notre-Dame, Ste-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, there were several schools on the &quot;Island&quot; and on the &quot;Mount&quot;. &quot;Whoever&quot;, says Crevier &quot;had the right to teach might open a school where he pleased, provided it was not in the vicinity of a principal school.&quot; Thus a certain Adam, who was of English origin, kept his &quot;near the Petit Pont&quot;; another Adam, Parisian by birth, &quot;taught at the Grand Pont which is called the Pont-au-Change&quot; (&quot;Hist. de l&#x27;Univers. de Paris,&quot; I, 272).

The number of students in the school of the capital grew constantly, so that lodgings were insufficient. French students included princes of the blood, sons of the nobility, and ranking gentry. The courses at Paris were considered so necessary as a completion of studies that many foreigners flocked to them. Popes Celestine II, Adrian IV and Innocent III studied at Paris, and Alexander III sent his nephews there. Noted German and English students included Otto of Freisingen, Cardinal Conrad, Archbishop of Mainz, St. Thomas of Canterbury, and John of Salisbury; while Ste-Geneviève became practically the seminary for Denmark. The chroniclers of the time called Paris the city of letters par excellence, placing it above Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and other cities: &quot;At that time, there flourished at Paris philosophy and all branches of learning, and there the seven arts were studied and held in such esteem as they never were at Athens, Egypt, Rome, or elsewhere in the world.&quot; (&quot;Les gestes de Philippe-Auguste&quot;). Poets extolled the university in their verses, comparing it to all that was greatest, noblest, and most valuable in the world.
To allow poor students to study the first college des dix-Huit was founded by a knight returning from Jerusalem called Josse of London for 18 scholars who received lodgings and 12 pence or denarii a month.

As the university developed, it became more institutionalized. First, the professors formed an association, for according to Matthew Paris, John of Celles, twenty-first Abbot of St Albans, England, was admitted as a member of the teaching corps of Paris after he had followed the courses (&quot;Vita Joannis I, XXI, abbat. S. Alban&quot;). The masters, as well as the students, were divided according to national origin. Alban wrote that Henry II, King of England, in his difficulties with St. Thomas of Canterbury, wanted to submit his cause to a tribunal composed of professors of Paris, chosen from various provinces (Hist. major, Henry II, to end of 1169). This was likely the start of the division according to &quot;nations,&quot; which was later to play an important part in the university. Celestine III ruled that both professors and students had the privilege of being subject only to the ecclesiastical courts, not to civil courts.

The three schools: Notre-Dame, Sainte-Geneviève, and Saint-Victor, may be regarded as the triple cradle of the &quot;Universitas scholarium&quot;, which included masters and students; hence the name &quot;University&quot;. Henry Denifle and some others hold that this honour is exclusive to the school of Notre-Dame (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis), but the reasons do not seem convincing. He excludes Saint-Victor because, at the request of the abbot and the religious of Saint-Victor, Gregory IX in 1237 authorized them to resume the interrupted teaching of theology. But the university was largely founded about 1208, as is shown by a Bull of Innocent III. Consequently, the schools of Saint-Victor might well have contributed to its formation. Secondly, Denifle excludes the schools of Ste-Geneviève because there had been no interruption in the teaching of the liberal arts. This is debatable and through the period, theology was taught. The chancellor of Ste-Geneviève continued to give degrees in arts, something he would have ceased if his abbey had no part in the university organization.

===13th–14th century: Expansion===
In 1200, King Philip II issued a diploma &quot;for the security of the scholars of Paris,&quot; which affirmed that students were subject only to ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The provost and other officers were forbidden to arrest a student for any offence, unless to transfer him to ecclesiastical authority. The king&#x27;s officers could not intervene with any member unless having a mandate from an ecclesiastical authority. His action followed a violent incident between students and officers outside the city walls at a pub.

In 1215, the Apostolic legate, Robert de Courçon, issued new rules governing who could become a professor. To teach the arts, a candidate had to be at least twenty-one, to have studied these arts at least six years, and to take an engagement as professor for at least two years. For a chair in theology, the candidate had to be thirty years of age, with eight years of theological studies, of which the last three years were devoted to special courses of lectures in preparation for the mastership. These studies had to be made in the local schools under the direction of a master. In Paris, one was regarded as a scholar only by studies with particular masters. Lastly, purity of morals was as important as reading. The licence was granted, according to custom, gratuitously, without oath or condition. Masters and students were permitted to unite, even by oath, in defence of their rights, when they could not otherwise obtain justice in serious matters. No mention is made either of law or of medicine, probably because these sciences were less prominent.

In 1229, a denial of justice by the queen led to suspension of the courses. The pope intervened with a bull that began with lavish praise of the university: &quot;Paris&quot;, said Gregory IX, &quot;mother of the sciences, is another Cariath-Sepher, city of letters&quot;. He commissioned the Bishops of Le Mans and Senlis and the Archdeacon of Châlons to negotiate with the French Court for the restoration of the university, but by the end of 1230 they had accomplished nothing. Gregory IX then addressed a Bull of 1231 to the masters and scholars of Paris. Not only did he settle the dispute, he empowered the university to frame statutes concerning the discipline of the schools, the method of instruction, the defence of theses, the costume of the professors, and the obsequies of masters and students (expanding upon Robert de Courçon&#x27;s statutes). Most importantly, the pope granted the university the right to suspend its courses, if justice were denied it, until it should receive full satisfaction.

The pope authorized Pierre Le Mangeur to collect a moderate fee for the conferring of the license of professorship. Also, for the first time, the scholars had to pay tuition fees for their education: two sous weekly, to be deposited in the common fund.

====Rector====
The university was organized as follows: at the head of the teaching body was a rector. The office was elective and of short duration; at first it was limited to four or six weeks. Simon de Brion, legate of the Holy See in France, realizing that such frequent changes caused serious inconvenience, decided that the rectorate should last three months, and this rule was observed for three years. Then the term was lengthened to one, two, and sometimes three years. The right of election belonged to the procurators of the four nations. Henry of Unna was proctor of the University of Paris in the 14th century, beginning his term on January 13, 1340.

====Four &quot;nations&quot;====

The &quot;nations&quot; appeared in the second half of the twelfth century. They were mentioned in the Bull of Honorius III in 1222. Later, they formed a distinct body. By 1249, the four nations existed with their procurators, their rights (more or less well-defined), and their keen rivalries: the nations were the French, English, Normans, and Picards. After the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the English nation was replaced by the Germanic. The four nations constituted the faculty of arts or letters.

The territories covered by the four nations were:
* French nation: all the Romance-speaking parts of Europe except those included within the Norman and Picard nations
* English nation (renamed &#x27;German nation&#x27; after the Hundred Years&#x27; War): the British Isles, the Germanic-speaking parts of continental Europe (except those included within the Picard nation), and the Slavic-speaking parts of Europe. The majority of students within that nation came from Germany and Scotland, and when it was renamed &#x27;German nation&#x27; it was also sometimes called &quot;natio Germanorum et Scotorum&quot; (&quot;nation of the Germans and Scots&quot;).
* Norman nation: the ecclesiastical province of Rouen, which corresponded approximately to the Duchy of Normandy. This was a Romance-speaking territory, but it was not included within the French nation.
* Picard nation: the Romance-speaking bishoprics of Beauvais, Noyon, Amiens, Laon, and Arras; the bilingual (Romance and Germanic-speaking) bishoprics of Thérouanne, Cambrai, and Tournai; a large part of the bilingual bishopric of Liège; and the southernmost part of the Germanic-speaking bishopric of Utrecht (the part of that bishopric located south of the river Meuse; the rest of the bishopric north of the Meuse belonged to the English nation). It was estimated that about half of the students in the Picard nation were Romance-speakers (Picard and Walloon), and the other half were Germanic-speakers (West Flemish, East Flemish, Brabantian and Limburgish dialects).

====Faculties====

To classify professors&#x27; knowledge, the schools of Paris gradually divided into faculties. Professors of the same science were brought into closer contact until the community of rights and interests cemented the union and made them distinct groups. The faculty of medicine seems to have been the last to form. But the four faculties were already formally established by 1254, when the university described in a letter &quot;theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and rational, natural, and moral philosophy&quot;. The masters of theology often set the example for the other faculties—e.g., they were the first to adopt an official seal.

The faculties of theology, canon law, and medicine, were called &quot;superior faculties&quot;. The title of &quot;Dean&quot; as designating the head of a faculty, came into use by 1268 in the faculties of law and medicine, and by 1296 in the faculty of theology. It seems that at first the deans were the oldest masters. The faculty of arts continued to have four procurators of its four nations and its head was the rector. As the faculties became more fully organized, the division into four nations partially disappeared for theology, law and medicine, though it continued in arts. Eventually the superior faculties included only doctors, leaving the bachelors to the faculty of arts. At this period, therefore, the university had two principal degrees, the baccalaureate and the doctorate. It was not until much later that the licentiate and the DEA became intermediate degrees.

====Colleges====

The scattered condition of the scholars in Paris often made lodging difficult. Some students rented rooms from townspeople, who often exacted high rates while the students demanded lower. This tension between scholars and citizens would have developed into a sort of civil war if Robert de Courçon had not found the remedy of taxation. It was upheld in the Bull of Gregory IX of 1231, but with an important modification: its exercise was to be shared with the citizens. The aim was to offer the students a shelter where they would fear neither annoyance from the owners nor the dangers of the world. Thus were founded the colleges (colligere, to assemble); meaning not centers of instruction, but simple student boarding-houses. Each had a special goal, being established for students of the same nationality or the same science. Often, masters lived in each college and oversaw its activities.

Four colleges appeared in the 12th century; they became more numerous in the 13th, including Collège d&#x27;Harcourt (1280) and the Collège de Sorbonne (1257). Thus the University of Paris assumed its basic form. It was composed of seven groups, the four nations of the faculty of arts, and the three superior faculties of theology, law, and medicine. Men who had studied at Paris became an increasing presence in the high ranks of the Church hierarchy; eventually, students at the University of Paris saw it as a right that they would be eligible to benefices. Church officials such as St. Louis and Clement IV lavishly praised the university.

Besides the famous Collège de Sorbonne, other &quot;collegia&quot; provided housing and meals to students, sometimes for those of the same geographical origin in a more restricted sense than that represented by the nations. There were 8 or 9 &quot;collegia&quot; for foreign students: the oldest one was the Danish college, the &quot;Collegium danicum&quot; or &quot;dacicum&quot;, founded in 1257. Swedish students could, during the 13th and 14th centuries, live in one of three Swedish colleges, the &quot;Collegium Upsaliense&quot;, the &quot;Collegium Scarense&quot; or the &quot;Collegium Lincopense&quot;, named after the Swedish dioceses of Uppsala, Skara and Linköping.

The&quot; Collège de Navarre&quot; was founded in 1305, originally aimed at students from Navarre, but due to its size, wealth, and the links between the crowns of France and Navarre, it quickly accepted students from other nations. The establishment of the College of Navarre was a turning point in the university&#x27;s history: Navarra was the first college to offer teaching to its students, which at the time set it apart from all previous colleges, founded as charitable institutions that provided lodging, but no tuition. Navarre&#x27;s model combining lodging and tuition would be reproduced by other colleges, both in Paris and other universities.
The German College, &quot;Collegium alemanicum&quot; is mentioned as early as 1345, the Scots college or &quot;Collegium scoticum&quot; was founded in 1325. The Lombard college or &quot;Collegium lombardicum&quot; was founded in the 1330s. The &quot;Collegium constantinopolitanum&quot; was, according to a tradition, founded in the 13th century to facilitate a merging of the eastern and western churches. It was later reorganized as a French institution, the &quot;Collège de la Marche-Winville&quot;. The Collège de Montaigu was founded by the Archbishop of Rouen in the 14th century, and reformed in the 15th century by the humanist Jan Standonck, when it attracted reformers from within the Roman Catholic Church (such as Erasmus and Ignatius of Loyola) and those who subsequently became Protestants (John Calvin and John Knox).

At this time, the university also went the controversy of the condemnations of 1210–1277.

The Irish College in Paris originated in 1578 with students dispersed between Collège Montaigu, Collège de Boncourt, and the Collège de Navarre; in 1677 it was awarded possession of the Collège des Lombards. A new Irish College was built in 1769 in rue du Cheval Vert (now rue des Irlandais), which exists today as the Irish Chaplaincy and Cultural centre.

===15th–18th century: Influence in France and Europe===

In the fifteenth century, Guillaume d&#x27;Estouteville, a cardinal and Apostolic legate, reformed the university, correcting its perceived abuses and introducing various modifications. This reform was less an innovation than a recall to observance of the old rules, as was the reform of 1600, undertaken by the royal government with regard to the three higher faculties. Nonetheless, and as to the faculty of arts, the reform of 1600 introduced the study of Greek, of French poets and orators, and of additional classical figures like Hesiod, Plato, Demosthenes, Cicero, Virgil, and Sallust. The prohibition from teaching civil law was never well observed at Paris, but in 1679 Louis XIV officially authorized the teaching of civil law in the faculty of decretals. The &quot;faculty of law&quot; hence replaced the &quot;faculty of decretals&quot;. The colleges meantime had multiplied; those of Cardinal Le-Moine and Navarre were founded in the fourteenth century. The Hundred Years&#x27; War was fatal to these establishments, but the university set about remedying the injury.

Besides its teaching, the University of Paris played an important part in several disputes: in the Church, during the Great Schism; in the councils, in dealing with heresies and divisions; in the State, during national crises. Under the domination of England it played a role in the trial of Joan of Arc.

Proud of its rights and privileges, the University of Paris fought energetically to maintain them, hence the long struggle against the mendicant orders on academic as well as on religious grounds. Hence also the shorter conflict against the Jesuits, who claimed by word and action a share in its teaching. It made extensive use of its right to decide administratively according to occasion and necessity. In some instances it openly endorsed the censures of the faculty of theology and pronounced condemnation in its own name, as in the case of the Flagellants.

Its patriotism was especially manifested on two occasions. During the captivity of King John, when Paris was given over to factions, the university sought to restore peace; and under LouisXIV, when the Spaniards crossed the Somme and threatened the capital, it placed two hundred men at the king&#x27;s disposal and offered the Master of Arts degree gratuitously to scholars who should present certificates of service in the army (Jourdain, &quot;Hist. de l&#x27;Univers. de Paris au XVIIe et XVIIIe siècle&quot;, 132–34; &quot;Archiv. du ministère de l&#x27;instruction publique&quot;).

===1793: Abolition by the French Revolution===
The ancient university disappeared with the ancien régime in the French Revolution. On 15 September 1793, petitioned by the Department of Paris and several departmental groups, the National Convention decided that independently of the primary schools, &quot;there should be established in the Republic three progressive degrees of instruction; the first for the knowledge indispensable to artisans and workmen of all kinds; the second for further knowledge necessary to those intending to embrace the other professions of society; and the third for those branches of instruction the study of which is not within the reach of all men&quot;.

Measures were to be taken immediately: &quot;For means of execution the department and the municipality of Paris are authorized to consult with the Committee of Public Instruction of the National Convention, in order that these establishments shall be put in action by 1 November next, and consequently colleges now in operation and the faculties of theology, medicine, arts, and law are suppressed throughout the Republic&quot;. This was the death-sentence of the university. It was not to be restored after the Revolution had subsided, no more than those of the provinces.

===1806–1968: Re-establishment===
The university was re-established by Napoleon on 1 May 1806. All the faculties were replaced by a single centre, the University of France. The decree of 17 March 1808 created five distinct faculties: Law, Medicine, Letters/Humanities, Sciences, and Theology; traditionally, Letters and Sciences had been grouped together into one faculty, that of &quot;Arts&quot;. After a century, people recognized that the new system was less favourable to study. The defeat of 1870 at the hands of Prussia was partially blamed on the growth of the superiority of the German university system of the 19th century, and led to another serious reform of the French university. In the 1880s, the &quot;licence&quot; (bachelor) degree is divided into, for the Faculty of Letters: Letters, Philosophy, History, Modern Languages, with French, Latin and Greek being requirements for all of them; and for the Faculty of Science, into: Mathematics, Physical Sciences and Natural Sciences; the Faculty of Theology is abolished by the Republic. At this time, the building of the Sorbonne was fully renovated.

===May 1968–1970: Shutdown===
The student revolts of the late 1960s were caused in part by the French government&#x27;s failure to plan for a sudden explosion in the number of university students as a result of the postwar baby boom. The number of French university students skyrocketed from only 280,000 during the 1962–63 academic year to 500,000 in 1967–68, but at the start of the decade, there were only 16 public universities in the entire country. To accommodate this rapid growth, the government hastily developed bare-bones off-site faculties as annexes of existing universities (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses). These faculties did not have university status of their own and lacked academic traditions and amenities to support student life or resident professors. One-third of all French university students ended up in these new faculties, and were ripe for radicalization as a result of being forced to pursue their studies in such shabby conditions.

In 1966, after a student revolt in Paris, Christian Fouchet, minister of education, proposed &quot;the reorganisation of university studies into separate two- and four-year degrees, alongside the introduction of selective admission criteria&quot; as a response to overcrowding in lecture halls. Dissatisfied with these educational reforms, students began protesting in November 1967, at the campus of the University of Paris in Nanterre; indeed, according to James Marshall, these reforms were seen &quot;as the manifestations of the technocratic-capitalist state by some, and by others as attempts to destroy the liberal university&quot;. After student activists protested against the Vietnam War, the campus was closed by authorities on 22 March and again on 2 May 1968. Agitation spread to the Sorbonne the next day, and many students were arrested in the following week. Barricades were erected throughout the Latin Quarter, and a massive demonstration took place on 13 May, gathering students and workers on strike. The number of workers on strike reached about nine million by 22 May. As explained by Bill Readings:

De Gaulle responded on May 24 by calling for a referendum, and [...] the revolutionaries, led by informal action committees, attacked and burned the Paris Stock Exchange in response. The Gaullist government then held talks with union leaders, who agreed to a package of wage-rises and increases in union rights. The strikers, however, simply refused the plan. With the French state tottering, de Gaulle fled France on May 29 for a French military base in Germany. He later returned and, with the assurance of military support, announced [general] elections [within] forty days. [...] Over the next two months, the strikes were broken (or broke up) while the election was won by the Gaullists with an increased majority.
===1970: Dissolution===
Following the disruption, de Gaulle appointed Edgar Faure as minister of education; Faure was assigned to prepare a legislative proposal for reform of the French university system, with the help of academics. Their proposal was adopted on 12 November 1968; in accordance with the new law, the faculties of the University of Paris were to reorganize themselves. This led to the division of the University of Paris into 13 universities.

In 2017, Paris 4 and Paris 6 universities merged to form the Sorbonne University. In 2019, Paris 5 and Paris 7 universities merged to form the new Paris Cité University, leaving the number of successor universities at 11.

The successor universities to the University of Paris are now split over of the Île-de-France region.

Most of these successor universities have joined several groups of universities and higher education institutions in the Paris region, created in the 2010s.

<text>In Greek mythology and history, Promachus (; Ancient Greek: Πρόμαχος; English translation: &quot;who leads in battle&quot; or &quot;champion&quot;) is a name that refers to several different people.

&quot;Mythology&quot;

*Promachus, son of Aeson. King of Iolcus, and Alcimede or Amphinome. He was killed by Pelias along with his father, while his older brother, Jason, searched for the Golden Fleece.
*Promachus, son of Parthenopaeus and one of the Epigoni, who attacked the city of Thebes to avenge their fathers, the Seven against Thebes, who died attempting the same thing. Promachus died in the attack, and was buried nearby at Teumessus.
*Promachus, son of Alegenor, from Boeotia, a Greek warrior in the &quot;Iliad&quot; who was killed by Acamas.
*Promachus, son of Heracles and Psophis, brother of Echephron.
*Promachus, one of the Suitors of Penelope from Ithaca along with 11 other wooers. He, with the other suitors, was killed by Odysseus with the assistance of Eumaeus, Philoetius, and Telemachus.
*Promachus of Knossos, who was desperate to win the love of the handsome youth Leucocomas. He risked his life facing various challenges to win notable prizes, but Leucocomas remained indifferent. Finally, Promachus won a famous helmet for a prize and put it on the head of another youth in the presence of Leucocomas: the latter was overcome with jealousy and stabbed himself.
*The name Promachus, &quot;the champion&quot;, also occurs as a surname of Athena in Athens, Heracles at Thebes, and of Hermes at Tanagra.

&quot;History&quot;

*Promachus of Macedon, a common soldier who died of alcohol abuse.
*Promachus of Pellene, a pankration champion.

<text>The of the history of Japan covers the years from 710 to 794. Empress Genmei established the capital of Heijō-kyō (present-day Nara). Except for a five-year period (740–745), when the capital was briefly moved again, it remained the capital of Japanese civilization until Emperor Kanmu established a new capital, Nagaoka-kyō, in 784, before moving to Heian-kyō, modern Kyoto, a decade later in 794.

Japanese society during this period was predominantly agricultural and centered on village life. Most of the villagers followed Shintō, a religion based on the worship of natural and ancestral spirits named &quot;kami.&quot;

The capital at Nara was modeled after Chang&#x27;an, the capital city of the Tang dynasty. In many other ways, the Japanese upper classes patterned themselves after the Chinese, including adopting the Chinese writing system, Chinese fashion, and a Chinese version of Buddhism.

==Literature==
Concentrated efforts by the imperial court to record its history produced the first works of Japanese literature during the Nara period. Works such as the and the were political, used to record and therefore justify and establish the supremacy of the rule of the emperors within Japan.

With the spread of written language, the writing of Japanese poetry, known in Japanese as &quot;waka&quot;, began. The largest and longest-surviving collection of Japanese poetry, the , was compiled from poems mostly composed between 600 and 759 CE. This, and other Nara texts, used Chinese characters to express the sounds of Japanese, known as &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot;.

==Economic, livelihood, and administrative developments==

Before the Taihō Code was established, the capital was customarily moved after the death of an emperor because of the ancient belief that a place of death was polluted. Reforms and bureaucratization of government led to the establishment of a permanent imperial capital at Heijō-kyō, or Nara, in AD 710.
The capital was moved shortly (for reasons described later in this section) to Kuni-kyō (present-day Kizugawa) in 740–744, to Naniwa-kyō (present-day Osaka) in 744–745, to Shigarakinomiya (紫香楽宮, present-day Shigaraki) in 745, and moved back to Nara in 745. Nara was Japan&#x27;s first truly urban center. It soon had a population of 200,000 (representing nearly 7% of the country&#x27;s population) and some 10,000 people worked in government jobs.

Economic and administrative activity increased during the Nara period. Roads linked Nara to provincial capitals, and taxes were collected more efficiently and routinely. Coins were minted, if not widely used. Outside the Nara area, there was little commercial activity, and in the provinces the old Shōtoku land reform systems declined. By the mid-eighth century, &quot;shōen&quot; (landed estates), one of the most important economic institutions in prehistoric Japan, began to rise as a result of the search for a more manageable form of landholding. Local administration gradually became more self-sufficient, while the breakdown of the old land distribution system and the rise of taxes led to the loss or abandonment of land by many people who became the &quot;wave people&quot; (&quot;&quot;). Some of these formerly &quot;public people&quot; were privately employed by large landholders, and &quot;public lands&quot; increasingly reverted to the &quot;shōen&quot;.

Factional fighting at the imperial court continued throughout the Nara period. Imperial family members, leading court families, such as the Fujiwara, and Buddhist priests all contended for influence. Earlier during this period, Prince Nagaya seized power at the court after the death of Fujiwara no Fuhito. Fuhito was succeeded by four sons, Muchimaro, Umakai, Fusasaki, and Maro. They put Emperor Shōmu, the prince by Fuhito&#x27;s daughter, on the throne. In 729, they arrested Nagaya and regained control. As a major outbreak of smallpox spread from Kyūshū in 735, all four brothers died two years later, resulting in temporary reduction in the Fujiwara dominance. In 740, a member of the Fujiwara clan, Hirotsugu, launched a rebellion from his base in Fukuoka, Kyushu. Although the rebellion was defeated, there is no doubt that the emperor was shocked and frightened by these events, and he moved the palace three times in only five years from 740, until he eventually returned to Nara.

In the late Nara period, financial burdens on the state increased, and the court began dismissing nonessential officials. In 792 universal conscription was abandoned, and district heads were allowed to establish private militia forces for local police work. Decentralization of authority became the rule despite the reforms of the Nara period. Eventually, to return control to imperial hands, the capital was moved in 784 to Nagaoka-kyō and in 794 to Heian-kyō (literally Capital of Peace and Tranquility), about twenty-six kilometers north of Nara. By the late eleventh century, the city was popularly called Kyoto (capital city), the name it has had ever since.

==Cultural developments and the establishment of Buddhism==

Some of Japan&#x27;s literary monuments were written during the Nara period, including the and , the first national histories, compiled in 712 and 720 respectively; the , an anthology of poems; and the &quot;Kaifūsō&quot;, an anthology written in &quot;kanji&quot; by Japanese emperors and princes.

Another major cultural development of the era was the permanent establishment of Buddhism. Buddhism was introduced by Baekje in the sixth century but had a mixed reception until the Nara period, when it was heartily embraced by Emperor Shōmu. Shōmu and his Fujiwara consort were fervent Buddhists and actively promoted the spread of Buddhism, making it the &quot;guardian of the state&quot; and a way of strengthening Japanese institutions.

During Shōmu&#x27;s reign, the Tōdai-ji (literally Eastern Great Temple) was built. Within it was placed the Great Buddha Daibutsu: a 16-metre-high, gilt-bronze statue. This Buddha was identified with the Sun Goddess, and a gradual syncretism of Buddhism and Shinto ensued. Shōmu declared himself the &quot;Servant of the Three Treasures&quot; of Buddhism: the Buddha, the law or teachings of Buddhism, and the Buddhist community.

The central government established temples called &quot;kokubunji&quot; in the provinces. The Tōdai-ji was the kokubunji of Yamato Province (present-day Nara Prefecture).

Although these efforts stopped short of making Buddhism the state religion, Nara Buddhism heightened the status of the imperial family. Buddhist influence at court increased under the two reigns of Shōmu&#x27;s daughter. As Empress Kōken (r. 749–758) she brought many Buddhist priests into court. Kōken abdicated in 758 on the advice of her cousin, Fujiwara no Nakamaro. When the retired empress came to favor a Buddhist faith healer named Dōkyō, Nakamaro rose up in arms in 764 but was quickly crushed. Kōken charged the ruling emperor with colluding with Nakamaro and had him deposed. Kōken reascended the throne as Empress Shōtoku (r. 764–770).

The empress commissioned the printing of 1 million prayer charms — the Hyakumantō Darani — many examples of which survive. The small scrolls, dating from 770, are among the earliest printed works in the world. Shōtoku had the charms printed to placate the Buddhist clergy. She may even have wanted to make Dōkyō emperor, but she died before she could act. Her actions shocked Nara society and led to the exclusion of women from imperial succession and the removal of Buddhist priests from positions of political authority.

Many of the Japanese artworks and imported treasures from other countries during the era of Emperors Shōmu and Shōtoku are archived in Shōsō-in of Tōdai-ji temple. They are called &quot;Shōsōin treasures&quot; and illustrate the cosmopolitan culture known as Tempyō culture. Imported treasures show the cultural influences of Silk Road areas, including China, Korea, India, and the Islamic empire. Shosoin stores more than 10,000 paper documents, the so-called . These are records written in the reverse side of the sutra or in the wrapping of imported items that survived as a result of reusing wasted official documents. Shōsōin documents contribute greatly to the historical research of Japanese political and social systems of the Nara period, and they even can be used to trace the development of the Japanese writing systems (such as katakana).

The first authentically Japanese gardens were built in the city of Nara at the end of the eighth century. Shorelines and stone settings were naturalistic, different from the heavier, earlier continental mode of constructing pond edges. Two such gardens have been found at excavations; both were used for poetry-writing festivities.

==International relations==
The Nara court aggressively imported knowledge about the Chinese civilization of its day (the Tang dynasty) by sending diplomatic envoys known as kentōshi to the Tang court every twenty years. Many Japanese students, both lay and Buddhist priests, studied in Chang&#x27;an and Luoyang. One student named Abe no Nakamaro passed the Chinese civil examination to be appointed to governmental posts in China. He served as governor-general in Annam (Chinese Vietnam) from 761 through 767. Many students who returned from China, such as Kibi no Makibi, were promoted to high government posts.

Tang China never sent official envoys to Japan, for Japanese kings, or &quot;emperors&quot; as they styled themselves, did not seek investiture from the Chinese emperor. A local Chinese government in the Lower Yangzi Valley sent a mission to Japan to return Japanese envoys who entered China through Balhae. The Chinese local mission could not return home due to the An Lushan Rebellion and remained in Japan.

The Hayato people (隼人) in southern Kyushu frequently resisted rule by the imperial dynasty during the Nara period. They are believed to be of Austronesian origin and had a unique culture that was different from the Japanese people. They were eventually subjugated by the Ritsuryō.

Relations with the Korean kingdom of Silla were initially peaceful, with regular diplomatic exchanges. The rise of Balhae north of Silla destabilized Japan-Silla relations. Balhae sent its first mission in 728 to Nara, which welcomed them as the successor state to Goguryeo, with which Japan had been allied until Silla unified the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

<text>In Greek mythology, Sciron, also Sceiron, Skeirôn and Scyron, (; gen.: Σκίρωνoς) was one of the malefactors killed by Theseus on the way from Troezen to Athens. He was a famous Corinthian bandit who haunted the frontier between Attica and Megaris.

== Family ==
Sciron was the son of either Pelops and possibly Hippodameia, or Poseidon and Iphimedeia. Other sources makes his parents as Canethus and Henioche, a daughter of Pittheus which made him a cousin of Theseus. Sciron was also called the son of Pylas, king of Megara and thus great-grandson of Lelex.

Sciron was the father of Endeis by the daughter of Pandion or Chariclo, daughter of Cychreus. Through his daughter Endeis, Sciron was thus the grandfather of the heroes Telamon and Peleus. A son of Sciron named Alycus, in the army of the Dioscuri was also said to be slain by Theseus when the latter kidnapped the young Helen.

==Mythology==

=== Sciron, the robber ===
An Isthmian outlaw, Sciron dwelt at the Sceironian Rocks, a cliff on the Saronic coast of the Isthmus of Corinth on the Megarian territory. He robbed travelers passing the Sceironian Rocks and sitting near the sea he made it his practice to force them to wash his feet at a precipitous place. When they knelt before him, he would suddenly give them a kick over the cliff into the sea, where the victim&#x27;s body was devoured by a huge monstrous sea turtle which used to swim under the rocks or rolled down the crags into the sea at a place called Chelone (i.e. tortoise). As his fourth labour, Theseus slew him in the same way, by pushing him off the cliff or according to some, the hero seized him by the feet and threw him into the sea. In the pediment of the royal Stoa at Athens, there was a group of figures of burnt clay, representing Theseus in the act of throwing Sciron into the sea.

=== Sciron, the warlord ===
According to Plutarch, however, the Megarians claimed that Sciron was not a robber, but identified him with the Megarian warlord named Sciron. Sciron was neither a violent man nor a robber, but a chastiser of robbers, and a kinsman and friend of good and just men. For Aeacus, they say, is regarded as the most righteous of Hellenes, and Cychreus the Salaminian has divine honors at Athens, and the virtues of Peleus and Telamon are known to all men. Well, then, Sciron was a son-in law of Cychreus, father-in law of Aeacus, and grandfather of Peleus and Telamon, who were the sons of Endeis, daughter of Sciron and Chariclo. It is not likely, then, they say, that the best of men made family alliances with the basest, receiving and giving the greatest and most valuable pledges.When Pylas was exiled from Megara, he gave the rule to his son-in-law Pandion, who then gave it to his son Nisus. Sciron who married the daughter of Pandion disputed with Nisus about the throne. But later on, he agreed to accept the arbitration of Aeacus, king of Aegina, who decided that Nisus and his descendants should be king and have the government while Sciron was entitled as the military leader and in command of war. Sciron accepted this decision and married his daughter Endeïs to the chosen umpire Aeacus.

In one version, Theseus instituted the Isthmian Games so as to honor him and made expiation for his murder because of their kinship (they were cousins as their mothers Aethra and Henioche were sisters). Others, Plutarch remarked, bestow the honor of the games upon Sinis, another bandit killed by Theseus.

A passage in Ovid (&quot;Met.&quot;7.444), where the poet claims that certain cliffs by the name of Sciron owe their name to the man, suggests an aetiological origin for the tale.

In another story, Sciron, here identified as the son of a man named Polypemon, threw his daughter Alcyone into the sea to drown when he discovered that she had been sleeping with multiple men whilst unmarried.

<text>Citizens band radio (CB radio) is a land mobile radio system, a system allowing short-distance one-to-many bidirectional voice communication among individuals, using two-way radios operating near 27 MHz (or the 11-m wavelength) in the high frequency or shortwave band. Citizens band is distinct from other personal radio service allocations such as FRS, GMRS, MURS, UHF CB and the Amateur Radio Service (&quot;ham&quot; radio). In many countries, CB operation does not require a license and may be used for business or personal communications.

Like many other land mobile radio services, multiple radios in a local area share a single frequency channel, but only one can transmit at a time. The radio is normally in receive mode to receive transmissions of other radios on the channel; when users want to communicate they press a &quot;push to talk&quot; button on their radio, which turns on their transmitter. Users on a channel must take turns transmitting. In the US and Canada, and in the EU and the UK, transmitter power is limited to 4 watts when using AM and FM and 12 W PEP when using SSB. Illegal amplifiers to increase range are common.

CB radios using an omni-directional vertical antenna typically have a range of about 5 km to 30 km depending on terrain, for line of sight communication; however, various radio propagation conditions may intermittently allow communication over much greater distances. Base stations however may be connected to a directional Yagi–Uda antenna commonly called a Beam or a Yagi.

Multiple countries have created similar radio services, with varying technical standards and requirements for licensing. While they may be known by other names, such as the General Radio Service in Canada, they often use similar frequencies (26–28 MHz) and have similar uses, and similar technical standards. Although licenses may be required, eligibility is generally simple. Some countries also have personal radio services in the UHF band, such as the European PMR446 and the Australian UHF CB.

==History==
===United States===
====Origins====
The citizens band radio service originated in the United States as one of several personal radio services regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). These services began in 1945 to permit citizens a radio band for personal communication (e.g., radio-controlled model airplanes and family and business communications). In 1948, the original CB radios were designed for operation on the 460–470 MHz UHF band. There were two classes of CB radio: &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. Class B radios had simpler technical requirements, and were limited to a smaller frequency range. Al Gross established the Citizens Radio Corporation during the late 1940s to manufacture class B handhelds for the general public. Originally designed for use by the public sector, the Citizens Radio Corporation sold over 100,000 units, primarily to farmers and the US Coast Guard.

Ultra-high frequency (UHF) radios, at the time, were neither practical nor affordable for the average consumer. On September 11, 1958 CB service class D was created on 27 MHz, and this band became what is commonly known today as &quot;Citizens Band&quot;. Only 23 channels were available at the time; the first 22 were taken from the former amateur radio service 11-meter band, and channel 23 was shared with radio-controlled devices. Some hobbyists continue to use the designation &quot;11 meters&quot; to refer to the Citizens Band and adjoining frequencies. Part 95 of the Code of Federal Regulations regulates the class D CB service, on the 27 MHz band, since the 1970s and continuing today. Most of the 460–470 MHz band was reassigned for business and public-safety use; CB Class A is the forerunner of the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS). CB Class B is a more distant ancestor of the Family Radio Service. The Multi-Use Radio Service is another two-way radio service in the VHF high band. An unsuccessful petition was filed in 1973 to create a CB Class E service at 220 MHz, (part of the amateur radio 1.25-meter band at the time) which was opposed by amateur radio organizations and others. There are several other classes of personal radio services for specialized purposes (such as remote control devices).

During the 1960s, the service was used by small businesses (e.g., electricians, plumbers, carpenters), truck drivers and radio hobbyists. By the late 1960s, advances in solid-state electronics allowed the weight, size, and cost of the radios to fall, giving the public access to a communications medium previously only available to specialists. CB clubs were formed; a CB slang language evolved alongside ten-code, similar to those used in emergency services.

==== 1970s popularity ====
After the 1973 oil crisis, the U.S. government imposed a nationwide 55 mph speed limit, and fuel shortages and rationing were widespread. Drivers (especially commercial truckers) used CB radios to locate service stations with better supplies of fuel, to notify other drivers of speed traps, and to organize blockades and convoys in a 1974 strike protesting the new speed limit and other trucking regulations. The radios were crucial for independent truckers; many were paid by the mile, and the 55 mph speed limit lowered their productivity.

Their use spread further into the general population in the US in the middle of the 1970s. Originally, CB radios required the use of a callsign in addition to a purchased license ($20 in the early 1970s, reduced to $4 on March 1, 1975, or $ in dollars). However, when the CB craze was at its peak, many people ignored the requirement and invented their own nicknames (known as &quot;handles&quot;). Lax enforcement of the rules on authorized use of CB radio led to further widespread disregard of regulations (such as for antenna height, distance communications, licensing, call signs, and transmitter power). Individual licensing came to an end on April 28, 1983.

The growing popularity of CB radios in the 1970s was frequently depicted in film, television, music and books. Movies such as &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977), &quot;Breaker! Breaker!&quot; (1977), &quot;Handle with Care&quot; (also released as &quot;Citizens Band&quot;; 1977), and &quot;Convoy&quot; (1978), made heavy reference to the phenomenon, as did television series such as &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; (debuted in 1974), &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; (debuted in 1979) and the animated series &quot;CB Bears&quot; (debuted in 1977) helped cement CB radio&#x27;s status as a nationwide craze in the United States over the mid- to late-1970s. In Stephen King&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;The Stand&quot;, Ralph Brentner&#x27;s radio signal from Boulder, Colorado was able to be received over CB. The phenomenon also inspired several country and rock music songs in 1975 and 1976.

* C. W. McCall&#x27;s novelty song &quot;Convoy&quot; (1975) climbed to #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in January 1976 and to #2 on the UK singles chart during the spring of 1976. The song inspired the 1978 film of the same name directed by Sam Peckinpah. In the UK, BBC Radio One DJs Dave Lee Travis and Paul Burnett covered the song with altered lyrics, released as &quot;Convoy GB&quot; under the moniker &quot;Laurie Lingo &amp; the Dipsticks&quot;. The cover peaked at #4 on the UK chart in the spring of 1976. McCall also recorded &quot;&#x27;Round the World with the Rubber Duck&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Convoy&quot;. It was released in the late spring of 1976 and peaked at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.
* Dave Dudley&#x27;s 1975 novelty country song &quot;Me and ol&#x27; CB&quot; peaked at #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart and at #8 on the Canadian country chart.
* &quot;The White Knight&quot;, a novelty country music song, was written by Jay Huguely, who – recording as &quot;Cledus Maggard &amp; The Citizen&#x27;s Band&quot; – enjoyed a brief run of national popularity with the song when it became a hit in 1976, peaking at #19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.
* &quot;One Piece At A Time&quot; by Johnny Cash peaked at #12 on the UK charts in the early summer of 1976.
* The lyrics to the Outlaws&#x27;s country rock song &quot;Breaker-Breaker&quot; capitalize on the fad. The record peaked at #94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the spring of 1976.
* &quot;Teddy Bear&quot; by country singer Red Sovine charted at #6 in the UK in the late summer of 1976.
* Country singer Rod Hart&#x27;s &quot;C.B. Savage&quot; is a gay-themed country novelty song about truckers plagued by a mysterious effeminate CB aficionado.
Betty Ford, the former First Lady of the United States, used the CB handle &quot;First Mama&quot;.

Voice actor Mel Blanc was also an active CB operator, often using &quot;Bugs&quot; or &quot;Daffy&quot; as his handle and talking on the air in the Los Angeles area in one of his many voice characters. He appeared in an interview (with clips having fun talking to children on his home CB radio station) in the &quot;NBC Knowledge&quot; television episode about CB radio in 1978. Similar to Internet chat rooms a quarter-century later, CB allowed people to get to know one another in a quasi-anonymous manner.

Originally, the U.S. had 23 CB channels; the 40 channel band plan was implemented in 1977. Two more channels between 22 &amp; 23, commonly referred to as 22A &amp; 22B, were available. Several people had 22A, but few had 22B. In the early 1970s Radio Shack sold a &quot;base station&quot; CB radio that contained a crystal for each of the 23 channels, two extra slots existed, and one could order the 22A &amp; 22B crystals for an easy plug-in. Channel 9 was officially reserved for emergency use by the FCC in 1969. Channel 10 was originally often used for highway travel communications east of the Mississippi River, and channel 19 west of the Mississippi; channel 19 then became the preferred highway channel in most areas, as it did not have adjacent-channel interference problems with channel 9. Many CBers called channel 19 &quot;the trucker&#x27;s channel&quot;. The FCC originally restricted channel 11 for use as the calling channel.

The original FCC output power limitation for CB radios was &quot;5 watts DC input to the final amplifier stage&quot;, which was a reference to the earlier radios equipped with tubes. With solid state radios becoming more common in the 1970s, the FCC revised this specification at the same time the authorized channels were increased to 40. The current specification is simply &quot;4 watts output (AM) or 12 watts output (SSB)&quot; as measured at the antenna connector on the back of the radio. The old specification was often used in false advertising by some manufacturers who would claim their CB radios had &quot;5 watts&quot; long after the specification had changed to 4 watts output. The older 23 channel radios built under the old specifications typically had an output of around 3.5 to 3.8 watts output when measured at the antenna connector. The FCC simply rounded up the old &quot;5 watts DC input to the final amplifier stage&quot; specification to the new &quot;4 watts output as measured at the antenna connector on the back of the radio&quot;, resulting in a far simpler and easier specification.

Initially, the FCC intended for CB to be the &quot;poor man&#x27;s business-band radio&quot;, and CB regulations were structured similarly to those regulating the business band radio service. Until 1975, only channels 9–14 and 23 could be used for &quot;interstation&quot; calls (to other licensees). Channels 1–8 and 15–22 were reserved for &quot;intrastation&quot; communications (among units with the same license). After the inter-station/intra-station rule was dropped, channel 11 was reserved as a calling frequency (for the purpose of establishing communications); however, this was withdrawn in 1977. During this early period, many CB radios had &quot;inter-station&quot; channels colored on their dials, while the other channels were clear or normally colored. It was common for a town to adopt an inter-station channel as its &quot;home&quot; channel. This helped prevent overcrowding on channel 11, enabling a CBer to monitor a town&#x27;s home channel to contact another CBer from that town instead of a making a general call on channel 11.

====Boating and the U.S. Coast Guard====
Since the price of CB was dropping and VHF Marine Band was still expensive, many boaters installed CB radios. Business caught on to this market, and introduced marine CBs containing a weather band (WX). There was much controversy over whether the Coast Guard should monitor CB radio, but for safety they did so, using Motorola base stations at their search and rescue stations. The Coast Guard stopped this practice in the late 1980s and recommends VHF Marine Band radios for boaters.

====21st-century use====
CB has lost much of its original appeal due to development of mobile phones, the internet and the Family Radio Service. Changing radio propagation for long-distance communications due to the 11–year sunspot cycle is a factor at these frequencies. In addition, CB may have become a victim of its own popularity; with millions of users on a finite number of frequencies during the mid-to-late 1970s and early 1980s, channels often were noisy and communication difficult, which reduced interest among hobbyists. Business users (such as tow-truck operators, plumbers, and electricians) moved to the VHF and UHF business band frequencies. The business band requires an FCC license, and usually results in an assignment to a single frequency. The advantages of fewer users sharing a frequency, greater authorized output power, clarity of FM transmission, lack of interference by distant stations due to skip propagation, and consistent communications made the VHF (Very High Frequency) radio an attractive alternative to the overcrowded CB channels.

With these factors in play, CB radio has once again gained popularity in recent years, an uptick not seen since the &#x27;90s. Manufacturers report an increase in sales, while social media sites like YouTube show a growing popularity in CB radio content, mainly as a hobby. The technology has also given way to more compact CB radios with far more features afforded in older models. 

The FCC restricts channel 9 to emergency communications and roadside assistance. Most highway travelers monitor channel 19. Truck drivers still use CB, which is an effective means of obtaining information about road construction, accidents and police speed traps.

===Australia===
====History====
Before CB was authorized in Australia, hand-held 27-MHz &quot;walkie-talkies&quot; were available, which used several frequencies between the present CB channels, such as 27.240 MHz. By the mid-1970s, hobbyists were experimenting with handheld radios and unauthorized 23 channel American CB radios. At that time in Australia, licensed ham operators and Emergency Services still used the 11 meter band which was not yet available for CB use. Multiple CB clubs had formed by this time, which assigned call signs to members, exchanged QSL cards, and lobbied for the legalisation of CB. In late 1977, having legalised Australian CB and allowed the import / sale of American and Japanese 23 channel sets, the Federal Government drafted new interim regulations for Australian 18 channel transceivers. The new RB249 regulations came into effect on January 1, 1978, and the last official registration date for 23 channel sets was January 31, 1978. After this date, use of unregistered 23 channel CB sets was deemed illegal and unlicensed sets were no longer eligible to be licensed. The 18 channel band plan used 16 channels of the 23 channel CB radios plus 2 extra channels at 27.095 and 27.195 MHz, to make up the 18 channels. The original channels 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 21 and 23 were deleted from the 18 channel band plan. So channel 1 on an 18 channel was actually channel 5 on a 23 channel radio. These roughly corresponded to the present channels 5–22, except for the two unique frequencies that are known as 11A (Channel 7 on an 18 channel Australian CB) and 19A (Channel 16 on an 18 channel Australian CB) or remote control frequencies but are no longer part of the Australian 27 MHz CB band since 40 Channels were introduced. On January 1, 1982, the American 40 channel band plan was adopted.

From the outset, the government attempted to regulate CB radio with license fees and call signs, but eventually they abandoned this approach. Enthusiasts rushed for licences when the doors opened at post offices around Australia in mid-1977 and by the end of the first quarter of 1978 an estimated 200,000 licences were issued (Australia&#x27;s Population in 1978 was 14.36 million). The regulations called for one licence per CB radio. The price for a licence in 1977 was AU$25 per year (In mid 1977 the Australian Dollar exchange rate was AU$0.90 to US$1.00), a not insubstantial amount for the average Australian wage-earner. Australian CB radio uses AM, USB, and LSB modes (no FM) on 27 MHz, allowed output power being 4 Watts AM and 12 Watts SSB. When UHF CB was first legalised the 27 MHz CB Band was intended to be closed to Australian CBers in 1982 and only the 477 MHz UHF band was to continue, however this did not eventuate. The first 477 MHz CB radio in 1977 was designed and made in Australia by Philips TMC and was a 40 channel CB called the FM320.

====Community====
The first CB club in Australia was the &quot;Charlie Brown Touring Car Club&quot; (CBTCC), which formed in Morwell, Victoria in 1967 and consisted mainly of four-wheel drive enthusiasts. The club used the prefix &quot;GL&quot; (for Gippsland), since &quot;CB&quot; could not be used. After July 1, 1977, the club changed its name to Citizens Band Two Way Communication Club (CBTCC). Other early clubs were &quot;LV&quot; (Latrobe Valley) and &quot;WB&quot; (named after Wayne Britain). Members of these clubs are still active, and have also become amateur radio operators. Other Australian cities which became CB radio &quot;hotspots&quot; were Seymour, Benalla, Holbrook and Gundagai, all located on the busy Hume Highway between Melbourne and Sydney. Other regional cities such as Bendigo, Mildura, Mount Gambier and Port Augusta, developed lively, colourful CB radio communities.

====Competing technologies====
With the introduction of UHF CB radios in 1977, many operators used both UHF and HF radios and formed groups to own and operate local FM repeaters. Members of the CBTCC formed what became known as Australian Citizens Radio Movement (ACRM) in the early 1970s; this organization became the voice for legalization of CB radio throughout Australia. After peaking in the 1970s and early 1980s, the use of 27 MHz CB in Australia has fallen dramatically due to the introduction of 477 MHz UHF CB (with FM and repeaters) and the proliferation of cheap, compact handheld UHF transceivers. Technology such as mobile telephones and the internet have provided people with other choices for communications. The Australian government has changed the allocation of channels available for UHF CB Radio from 40 to 80, and doubled the number of repeater channels from 8 to 16.

====27 MHz marine radio====

Source:
Several channels are allocated for maritime use in Australia. Australia also permits the use of marine VHF radio. 27 MHz radios have the advantage of not requiring a certificate of proficiency to use, however they may not be monitored by rescue organisations or larger vessels. VHF radios are recommended by state agencies, such as Marine Safety Victoria and Marine Rescue NSW.

===Canada===
In Canada, the CRTC officially calls the CB band the &quot;General Radio Service&quot;, though regulations also note that this service is commonly called &quot;CB&quot;. Canada&#x27;s GRS uses the identical frequencies and modes as the United States citizens band, and no special provisions are required for either Canadians or Americans using CB gear while traveling across the border.

The General Radio Service was authorized in 1962. Initially, CB channels 1–3 remained allocated to amateur radio and channel 23 was used by paging services. American CB licensees were initially required to apply for a temporary license to operate in Canada. In April 1977, the service was expanded to the same 40 channels as the American service.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, CB radios were first introduced about 1977 when some transceivers were imported illegally from Australia, Japan and the United States. The dates are hard to confirm accurately, but early use was known around large cities such as Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Medan. The Indonesian government legalized CB on 6 October 1980 with a decision by the Minister of Communications, the &quot;Ministerial Decree on the Licensing for the Operation of Inter-Citizens Radio Communication&quot;. Because many people were already using 40 channel radios prior to legalization, the American band plan (with AM and SSB) was adopted; a VHF band was added in 1994, along with allowing use of the Australian UHF CB channel plan at 476-477 MHz On 10 November 1980, the Indonesian Directorate General of Posts and Telecommunications issued another decree establishing RAPI (&quot;Radio Antar Penduduk Indonesia&quot;) as the official citizens band radio organization in Indonesia.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, citizens band radios became legal when the &quot;Notification of Issuance Of Class Assignments&quot; by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia was published on 1 April 2000. Under this class assignment, a CB radio is classified as a &quot;Personal Radio Service device&quot;. The frequency band is HF, 26.9650 MHz to 27.4050 MHz (40 channels), power output is 4 watts for AM and FM and 12 watts PEP for SSB. Channel 9 is reserved for emergencies, and channel 11 is a calling channel. On UHF 477 MHz, citizens band PRS radio devices are allowed 5 watts power output on FM on 39 assigned channels spaced at 12.5 kHz intervals from 477.0125 to 477.4875 MHz. Channel 9 is reserved for emergencies, and channel 11 for calling. A short-range simplex radio communications service for recreational use is from 477.5250 to 477.9875 MHz FM mode with 38 channels and a power output of 500 mW. A CB radio or Personal Radio Service Device under Class Assignment does not need an individual license to operate in Malaysia if it adheres to the rules of the &quot;Warta Kerajaan Malaysia&quot;

On 1 April 2010 the MCMC released a new regulation and later on 2017. This includes a new UHF PMR 446 MHz allocation: an eight-channel analog Personal Mobile Radio 446 MHz (Analog PMR446) with frequencies from 446.00625 to 446.09375 MHz (12.5 kHz spacing) FM with 0.5 watt power output, and 16 channels for Digital Personal Mobile Radio 446 MHz (Digital PMR 446). Frequencies for Digital PMR 446 are from 446.103125 to 446.196875 MHz with 6.25 kHz channel spacing in 4FSK mode and a power output of 0.5 watt. An unofficial citizens band radio club in Malaysia is the &quot;Malaysia Boleh Citizen Radio Group&quot;, known as &quot;Mike Bravo&quot; (&quot;Malaysia Boleh&quot;). Subsequently, the MCMC revoked 477 MHz personal radio service as a class assignment on 1 January 2022.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, a small but growing number of people were illegally using American CB radios during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The prominence of CB radio grew in Britain partly due to the success of novelty songs like C.W. McCall&#x27;s &quot;Convoy&quot; and Laurie Lingo &amp; The Dipsticks&#x27; &quot;Convoy GB&quot; in 1976 (both of which were Top 5 hits). By 1980, CB radio was becoming a popular pastime in Britain; as late as the summer of 1981 the British government was still saying that CB would never be legalized on 27 MHz, proposing a UHF service around 860 MHz called &quot;Open Channel&quot; instead. However, in November 1981 (after high-profile public demonstrations) 40 frequencies unique to the UK, known as the 27/81 Bandplan using FM were allocated at 27 MHz plus 20 channels on 934 MHz (934.0125–934.9625 MHz with 50 kHz spacing). CB&#x27;s inventor, Al Gross, made the ceremonial first legal British CB call from Trafalgar Square in London.

The maximum power allowable on the MPT 1320 27/81 system was 4 watts (in common with the American system), although initially radios were equipped to reduce output power by 10 dB (to 0.4 watts) if the antenna was mounted more than 7 meters (23&#x27;) above ground level. The power-reduction switch is also useful in reducing TV interference. MPT 1320 also restricted antennas to a maximum length of 1.5 meters (5&#x27;), with base loading being the only type permitted for 27 MHz operation. Over the next several years antenna regulations were relaxed, with antenna length increasing to 1.65 meters (5&#x27;5&quot;) and centre- or top-loading of the main radiating element permitted. On 1 September 1987 the UK added the usual 40 frequencies (26.965–27.405 MHz) used worldwide, for a total of 80 channels at 27 MHz; antenna regulations were further relaxed, and the 934 MHz band was withdrawn in 1998.

CB radio in the UK was deregulated in December 2006 by the regulatory body Ofcom, and CB radio in the UK is now license-free. The old MPT 1320 27/81 band will continue to be available for the foreseeable future. On 27 June 2014, changes were made by Ofcom to allow the use of AM &amp; SSB modes on CB in the UK legally for the first time. The rules regarding non-approved radios and power levels above 4 Watts on AM/FM and 12 Watts on SSB still apply, despite deregulation. Persons using illegal equipment or accessories still risk prosecution, fines or confiscation of equipment, although this is rarely enforced. AM and SSB on the freeband and amplifier use are common among enthusiasts. Packet radio is legal in the UK, although not widely used. Internet gateway stations are also beginning to appear; although illegal on 27 MHz, these units are connected to other CB stations around the world.

Although the use of CB radios in the UK is limited they are still in use, especially with the farming community, truckers, off-roaders and mini-cab services. The widely used channel for the Young Farmers&#x27; Club is channel 11. The normal calling and truckers&#x27; channel is channel 19, although many truck organisations and groups use other channels to avoid abuse.

==Frequency allocations==
CB radio is not a worldwide, standardized radio service. Each country decides if it wants to authorize such a radio service from its domestic frequency authorizations, and what its standards will be; however, similar radio services exist in many countries. Frequencies, power levels and modes (such as frequency modulation (FM), amplitude modulation (AM), and single-sideband modulation (SSB), often vary from country to country; use of foreign equipment may be illegal. However, many countries have adopted the American channels and their associated frequencies, which is generally in AM mode except some higher channels which are sometimes in SSB mode. In September 2021 the FCC approved the use of FM on CB radio.

=== Standard channels ===
The standard channel numbering is harmonized through the FCC (USA) and the CEPT (Europe).

See also channel assignments for CB use in the United States.
:* Channels 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19 have adjacent &quot;hidden&quot; channels (see below); channels 23, 24, and 25 are numbered out-of-order for their frequency allocations in the United States.

=== Intermediate channels ===
When looking at the FCC/CEPT channel list there are some channels with a spacing of 20 kHz instead of the regular 10 kHz step. These intermediate frequencies are reserved for the Radio Control Radio Service (RCRS). The RCRS service is commonly used for remote control of model aircraft and boats. It is an unofficial practice to name these channels by their next lower standard channel number along with a suffix &quot;A&quot; (&quot;after&quot;). For example, channel &quot;11A&quot; is 27.095 MHz, spaced 10 kHz after standard channel 11 (at 27.085 MHz) is used to provide for part of European railroad&#x27;s Eurobalise radio communication with trains.

=== SSB use ===

Single-sideband (SSB) operation involves the selection of either the Lower Side Band (LSB) or the Upper Side Band (USB) mode for transmit and receive. SSB radios also have the standard AM mode for communicating with standard CB radio models. With the original 23 CB channels SSB stations commonly used channel 16, to avoid interference to those using AM (SSB stations are authorized to use 12 watts, as opposed to 4 watts for AM stations) and to more easily locate other SSB stations. With the FCC authorization of 40 channels, SSB operation shifted to channels 36–40. Channel 36 (or 38 for LSB) became the unofficial SSB &quot;calling channels&quot; for stations seeking contacts, with the subsequent conversation moving to channels 37–40. CBers with AM-only radios are asked to not use channels 36 through 40. In return, SSB stations stay off the remaining 35 channels so they could be used by AM stations. This agreement provides interference-free operation for all operators by separating the far more powerful SSB stations from the AM stations. This solution also resolves the confusion created by the false advertising that SSB radios have 120 channels compared to only 40 for AM radios.

While a SSB radio has three possible &quot;modes&quot; (AM, LSB, USB) it can operate in, operation is still limited to the same 40 channels. Some manufacturers tried to sell more radios by claiming that with three different modes possible for each channel, it was the equivalent to 120 channels. Reality is far different: Attempting an SSB conversation while an AM conversation is in progress results in jammed communications for everyone. In general, each channel can only support one AM conversation and no others; if no AM conversation is in progress, two SSB conversations can share one channel without interference if one is in LSB and the other in USB mode. For a particular conversation, everyone must be tuned to the same channel and same mode in order to talk with each other.
Starting in October 2021 the FCC has approved FM for CB in the US.

=== Country-specific variations ===

The European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) adopted the North American channel assignments, except channel 23, frequency 27.255 MHz; channel 24, frequency 27.235 MHz; and channel 25, frequency 27.245 MHz. However, legal CB equipment sold in Europe does follow the North American channel designation. Some member countries permit additional modes and frequencies; for example, Germany has 40 additional channels at 26 MHz for a total of 80. The United Kingdom has an additional 40 channels between 27.60125 and 27.99125 MHz, also making 80 channels in total. Before CEPT, most member countries used a subset of the 40 U.S. channels.

In Russia and Poland, the channels are shifted 5 kHz down; for example, channel 30 is 27.300 MHz. Many operators add a switch to change between the &quot;zeroes&quot; (the Russian/Polish channel assignment) and the &quot;fives&quot; (the international/European assignment). Most contemporary radios built for those markets can do &quot;fives&quot; as well as &quot;zeroes&quot; out of the box. Since roughly 2005–2006, Russia and Poland have adopted use of the standard US channel offset as well as the older channel plan, for two overlapping &quot;grids&quot; of channels.

Russia uses an alphanumeric designation for their CB channel plans, because several &quot;grids&quot; or &quot;bands&quot; of 40 channels each are used, along with both AM and FM mode. Russian CB allocations follow the CB band 26.965–27.405 MHz (designated as band C), as well as 26.515–26.955 MHz (designated as band B) and 27.415–27.855 MHz (designated as band D). Some radios refer to the &quot;mid band&quot; (standard CB band) as &quot;band D&quot; which shifts the letters up one (making 26.515–26.955 MHz &quot;band C&quot; and 27.415–27.855 MHz &quot;band E&quot;.

For the convenience of users of the grid were marked by letters. Classic is considered the marking when the main range is designated letter &quot;C&quot;. The most common description of the channel is considered to be similar to the following: (C9FM or C9EFM or C9EF or 9EF).

In it:

* the first letter («C») is indicated by a grid that contains a set of 40 channels. If the first letter is not specified, it is considered that it is («C»). For example, (C9EF, 9EF)
* hereinafter (&quot;9&quot;) – the channel number. Sometimes less than 10 channels are designated 2 digits. For example, (C9EF, C09EF)
* behind it – an optional designation («E») for &quot;European&quot; or mandatory («R») for &quot;Russian&quot; size frequency nets. For example, (C9EF, C9F, C9RF)
* end – the used modulation («FM») or («F»), («AM») or («A»). e.g. (C9EFM, C9EF, C9EAM, C9EA)

An example of correct designations: C9EF, C9EA, C9RF, C9RA

The 25–30 MHz band (including the CB allocations and frequencies above and below the 26.5–27.860 MHz band) is heavily used for taxi cab and other mobile two-way communications systems in Russia, Ukraine and other former USSR country states.

New Zealand and Japan have unique allocations compared to any other country. New Zealand authorizes use of their New Zealand specific 40 channel 26.330–26.770 MHz frequency plan in addition to the &quot;standard&quot; 40 channel 26.965–27.405 MHz frequency plan for a total of 80 HF CB channels. New Zealand has adopted the Australian UHF CB System as well.

Japan&#x27;s CB allocation consists of 8 voice and 2 radio control channels with a maximum power output of 500 mW. AM mode is the only mode permitted and antennas must be non-removable and less than 199 cm (78 inches) long. In Japan, the 26–28 MHz range is allocated to fishery radio services and these frequencies are heavily used for marine communications. Japan&#x27;s &quot;double side band fishery radio&quot; or &quot;DSB Fishery Radio Service&quot; covers 26.760 MHz-26.944 MHz, 27.016 MHz, and 27.524-27.988 MHz. However, frequencies such as 27.005 MHz AM are widely pirated in Japan with very high power transmitters. This causes interference to the authorized low-power 1 Watt DSB (1 Watt AM) fishery radio service. Instead of 26–27 MHz, Japan has authorized several UHF FM CB-type personal radio services in the 348 MHz, 420–422 MHz and 903–904 MHz bands.

# 26.968 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 1
# 26.976 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 2
# 27.040 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 3
# 27.080 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 4
# 27.088 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 5
# 27.112 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 6
# 27.120 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 7
# 27.144 MHz – Japanese CB Channel 8 – Calling Channel

# 27.048 MHz – Japanese Remote Control R/C Frequency
# 27.136 MHz – Japanese Remote Control R/C Frequency
# 27.152 MHz – Japanese Remote Control R/C Frequency

Indonesia has the usual 40 channels at 27 MHz, plus a unique 60-channel allocation from 142.050 to 143.525 MHz.

In Brazil, CB channels were upgraded from 23 to 60 channels starting in 1979 and again in 1980 to (from 26.965 MHz to 27.855 MHz).

CB Radio Channels (ANATEL)
South Africa, like New Zealand and the UK, permits the use of two HF CB bands. South Africa has a 23 channel AM / SSB 29 MHz CB allocation (called &quot;29 Megs&quot; or &quot;29 MHz CB&quot;) from 29.710 to 29.985 MHz in 12.5 kHz steps. South Africa also permits use of standard CB channels 19–27 (27.185–27.275 MHz) with AM / SSB permitted. Many radios sold in South Africa feature both the 27 MHz and 29 MHz bands. A license from ICASA is no longer required to purchase or use a CB radio in South Africa.

Hungary allows use of the &quot;low channels&quot; for a total of 80 channels (26.515 MHz to 27.405 MHz).

Germany authorizes a similar allocation, with 40 channels from 26.965 to 27.405 MHz and another 40 channels from 26.565 to 26.955 MHz in regular 10-kHz steps.

The Czech Republic authorizes 80 channels as well (same as the German 80-channel plan). As in Germany, digital modes are allowed on certain frequencies. Internet gateways and radio repeaters are allowed on channels 18 [27.175 MHz] and 23 [27.255 MHz]. Paging is permitted on channel 1 (26.965 MHz) and channel 80 (26.955 MHz) is the recommended call channel for Czech CB radio operators.

Using radios outside their intended market can be dangerous, as well as illegal, as frequencies used by Citizen&#x27;s Band radios from other countries may operate on frequencies close to, or be used by, emergency services (for example, the Indonesian service around 142 MHz operates on frequencies allocated to a public safety network shared with police, fire and EMS services in Ontario, Canada).

In the Philippines, up to present time, the use of 27 MHz CB is still banned since the Marcos regime banned it in 1980s. Before it was banned, they use the same allocation as the US. A few operators still illegally utilize the 40 CB channels.

==Current use==
CB was the only practical two‑way radio system for the individual consumer, and served several subsets of users such as truck drivers, radio hobbyists, and those in need of short‑range radio communications, such as electricians, plumbers, and carpenters, who needed to communicate between job site and main office. While some users have moved on to other radio services, CB is still a popular hobby in many countries. The 27 MHz frequencies used by CB, which require a relatively long aerial antennas and tend to propagate poorly indoors, discourage the use of handheld radios. Many users of handheld radios (families, hunters and hikers) have moved on to 49 MHz and the UHF Family Radio Service; those needing a simple radio for professional use (e.g., tradesmen) have moved on to &quot;dot-color&quot; Business Band radios and the VHF Multi-Use Radio Service.

CB is still commonly used by long-haul truck drivers to communicate directions, traffic problems and other relevant matters. The unofficial &quot;travelers channel&quot; in most of the world is channel 19; in Australia it is channel 8 (27.055 MHz) and UHF channel 40 (477.400 MHz). In Russia, it is channel 15 (in addition to traditional emergency channel 9 and truckers&#x27; channel 19), in Greece it is channel 13, in Italy it is channel 5, all AM. These frequencies may have evolved because tuned circuits (particularly antennas) work best in the middle of the band; the frequency for channel 19 (not channel 20) is the center of the 40 channel US band and other things being equal, signals will be transmitted and heard the farthest. Since less standardization exists in Europe, CB there is more associated with hobbyists than with truckers.

Legal (short‑range) use of CB radio is sometimes impeded by users of illegal high‑power transmitters, which can be heard hundreds of miles away. The other problem with short‑range CB use is propagation; during long‑range &quot;skip&quot; conditions local signals are inaudible due to reception of multiple distant signals.

In the United States, the number of users and law enforcement financing by the Federal Communications Commission mean that only the worst offenders are sanctioned, which makes legitimate operation on the citizens band unreliable. Most offenders are not caught for interfering with other CB users; often, their self‑modified equipment generates harmonics and spurs which cause interference to services outside the citizens band and to consumer equipment.

The maximum legal CB power output level in the U.S. is 4 watts for AM (un-modulated carrier; modulation can be four times the carrier power, or 16 watts PEP) and 12 watts for SSB, as measured at the transmitter antenna connection. However, external linear amplifiers are often used illegally.

During the 1970s, the FCC banned the sale of linear amplifiers capable of operation from 24 to 35 MHz to discourage their use on the CB band, although the use of high‑power amplifiers continued. Late in 2006, the FCC amended the regulation to exclude only 26–28 MHz to facilitate amateur 10 meter operation. Lax enforcement enables manufacturers of illegal linear amplifiers to openly advertise their products; many CB dealers include these amplifiers in their catalogs. Due to their rampant, unchecked use of linear amplifiers, American CB Radio operators are often referred to as &quot;Alligators&quot;, by operators in other countries (suggesting American operators are &quot;All Mouth and No Ears&quot;). Attempts by law-abiding CB users to increase regulatory oversight have been ineffective.

==Technology==
At the beginning of the CB radio service, transmitters and receivers used vacuum tubes; solid-state transmitters were not widely available until 1965, after the introduction of RF power-transistors. Walkie-talkie hand-held units became affordable with the use of transistors. Early receivers did not cover all the channels of the service; channels were controlled by plug-in quartz crystals, with one of several operating frequencies selected by a panel control in more expensive units. Superheterodyne receivers (using one or two conversion stages) were the norm in good-quality equipment, although low-cost toy-type units used super-regenerative receivers. With the earliest sets two quartz crystals were needed for transmitting and receiving on each channel, which was costly. By the mid-1960s &quot;mixer&quot; circuits made frequency-synthesized radios possible, which reduced cost and allowed full coverage of all 23 channels with a smaller number of crystals (typically 14). The next improvement came during the mid-1970s; crystal synthesis was replaced by PLL technology using ICs, enabling 40 channel sets with only one crystal (10.240 MHz). Almost all were AM-only, although there were a few single sideband sets.

Most CB radios sold in the United States have the following features:
* Automatic noise limiter or noise blanker: Reduces background noise (such as spark ignition)
* CB / WX switch: Selects weather-radio receiver
* Automatic level control (ALC): Limits the transmitter modulation level to reduce distortion
* PA: Some transceivers can drive an external speaker and act as a low-power public address system, or &quot;bullhorn&quot;.
* RF gain: Adjusts the RF amplifier gain of the receiver; used to reduce received background noise, and to reduce &quot;clipping&quot; due to over-amplification of already-strong signals (for example, when the receiver is near the transmitter)
* NOR / 9 / 19: Quickly tunes preset channels for calling or emergency use
* SWR: Meter used to monitor reflected power caused by mismatched antennas and antenna cables
* Volume control

Microphone choices include:
* Dynamic microphone: Uses magnetic coil and permanent magnet
* Ceramic mic: Uses a piezoelectric element; rugged, low-cost but high-impedance
* Echo mic: Deliberately introduces distortion and echo into transmitted audio
* Electret microphone: Uses an electrostatic method to convert sound to electrical signals
* Noise-canceling microphone: Uses two elements to reduce background noise
* Power mic: An amplified microphone

==Antennas==
27 MHz is a relatively long wavelength for mobile communications, and the choice of antenna has a considerable impact on the performance of a CB radio. A common mobile antenna is a quarter-wave vertical whip. This is roughly 9 feet (2.7 m) tall; it is mounted low on the vehicle body, and often has a spring-and-ball mount to enhance its flexibility when scraping or striking overhead objects. Where a nine-foot whip is undesirable, shorter antennas include loading coils to make the antenna impedance the same as a physically longer antenna. The loading coil may be on the bottom, middle, or top of the antenna, while some antennas are wound in a continuously loaded helix.

Many truckers use two co-phased antennas, mounted on their outside mirrors. Such an array is intended to enhance performance to the front and back, while reducing it to the sides (a desirable pattern for long-haul truckers). To achieve this effect, the antennas must be separated by about eight feet, only practical on large trucks. Two antennas may be installed for symmetrical appearance, with only one connected.

Another mobile antenna is the continuously loaded half-wave version. They do not require a ground plane to present a near-50 ohm load to the radio, and are often used on fiberglass vehicles such as snowmobiles or boats. They are also useful in base stations where circumstances preclude the use of a ground-plane antenna. Handheld CBs may use either a telescoping center-loaded whip or a continuously loaded &quot;rubber ducky&quot; antenna.

Base CB antennas may be vertical for omnidirectional coverage, or directional &quot;beam&quot; antennas may be used to direct communications to a particular region. Ground-plane kits exist as mounting bases for mobile whips, and have several wire terminals or hardwired ground radials attached. These kits are designed to have a mobile whip screwed on top (a full-length, quarter-wave steel whip is preferred) and mounted on a mast. The ground radials replace the vehicle body (which is the counterpoise for a mobile whip in a typical vehicle installation).

==Skywave==
All frequencies in the HF spectrum (3–30 MHz) can be refracted by charged ions in the ionosphere. Refracting signals off the ionosphere is called skywave propagation, and the operator is said to be &quot;shooting skip&quot;. CB operators have communicated across thousands of miles and sometimes around the world. Even low-power 27 MHz signals can sometimes propagate over long distances.

In times of high sunspot activity, the band can remain open to much of the world for long periods of time. During low sunspot activity it may be impossible to use skywave at all, except during periods of Sporadic-E propagation (from late spring through mid-summer). Skip contributes to noise on CB frequencies. In the United States, it is no longer illegal to engage in (or attempt to engage in) CB communications with any station more than from an operator&#x27;s location. This restriction used to exist to keep CB as a local (line-of-sight) radio service; however, in the United States the restriction has been dropped. The legality of shooting skip is not an issue in most other countries. A recent FCC decision now allows shooting skip in the United States.

==Freebanding and export radios==
Operation on frequencies above or below the citizens band (on the &quot;uppers&quot; or &quot;lowers&quot;) is called &quot;freebanding&quot; or &quot;outbanding&quot;. While frequencies just below the CB segment (or between the CB segment and the amateur radio 10-meter band) seem quiet and under-utilized, they are allocated to other radio services (including government agencies) and unauthorized operation on them is illegal. Furthermore, illegal transmitters and amplifiers may not meet good engineering practice for harmonic distortion or &quot;splatter&quot;, which may disrupt other communications and make the unapproved equipment obvious to regulators. Freebanding is done with modified CB or amateur equipment, foreign CB radios which may offer different channels, or with radios intended for export. Legal operation in one country may be illegal in another; for example, in the UK until June 2014 only 80 FM channels were legal.

Unlike amateur radios with continuous frequency tuning, CBs manufactured for export are channelized. Frequency selection resembles that of modified American CBs more than any foreign frequency plan. They typically have a knob and display that reads up to channel 40, but include an extra band selector that shifts all 40 channels above or below the band and a &quot;+10 kHz&quot; button to reach the model control &quot;A&quot; channels. These radios may have 6 or even 12 bands, establishing a set of quasi-CB channels on many unauthorized frequencies. The bands are typically lettered A through F, with the normal citizens band as D.

For example, a freebander with an export radio who wants to use 27.635 MHz would choose channel 19 (27.185 MHz) and then shift the radio up one band (+450 kHz). It requires arithmetic on the part of the operator to determine the actual frequency, although more expensive radios include a frequency counter or a frequency display — two different components, providing an identical result. Illegal operations may unintentionally end up on frequencies very much in use. For instance, channel 19 shifted two bands up is 28.085 MHz, which is in a Morse code / data-only part of the 10 meter ham band. Voice transmissions in a Morse code-only segment are easily detectable by authorities. Amateur Radio Service operators record, locate, and report to the FCC frequency trespassing and intrusions of their frequency allocations by pirate transmissions or illegal operators for enforcement action.

Many freeband operators use amateur radios modified to transmit out of band, which is illegal in some countries. Older amateur radios may require component changes; for instance, the 1970s Yaesu FT-101 was modified for CB by replacing a set of crystals used to tune portions of the 10 meter band, although some variants of the FT-101 were sold with the US FCC channels standard and were capable of transmitting above and below the legal 40 channels by another 10 or more channels. On some newer radios, the modification may be as simple as disconnecting a jumper wire or a diode. Many types of amateur transceivers may be found on CB and freeband, ranging from full-coverage HF transceivers to simpler 10 meter mobile radios. In the United States, the FCC bans the importation and marketing of radios it deems easily modifiable for CB; it is illegal to transmit on CB frequencies with a ham radio except in emergencies where no other method of communication is available.

A gray market trade in imported CB gear exists in many countries. In some instances, the sale or ownership of foreign-specification CB gear is not illegal but its use is. With the FCC&#x27;s minimal enforcement of its CB rules, enthusiasts in the US use &quot;export radios&quot; or European frequency modulation (FM) CB gear to escape the crowded AM channels. American AM gear has also been exported to Europe.

&quot;Export radios&quot; are sold in the United States as 10 meter Amateur Radio transceivers. Marketing, import and sale of such radios is illegal if they are distributed as anything &quot;other&quot; than Amateur Radio transceivers. It is also illegal to use these radios outside of the Amateur Radio bands by anyone in the US, since they are not type-certified for other radio services and usually exceed authorized power limits. The use of these radios within the Amateur Radio Service by a licensed Amateur Radio operator within his / her license privileges is legal, as long as all FCC regulations for Amateur Radio are followed.

==Callbook==
A callbook is a directory of radio station call signs. Originally a bound book that resembled a telephone directory, it contains the name and addresses of radio stations in a given jurisdiction (country). &quot;Modern Electrics&quot; published the first callbook in the United States in 1909. Today, the primary purpose of a callbook is to allow radio operators to send a confirmation post card, called a QSL card, to an operator with whom they have communicated via radio. Callbooks have evolved to include online databases that are accessible via the Internet to instantly obtain the address of another amateur radio operator and their QSL managers. The most well known and used on-line QSL database for the 11 meter / freebander community is QRZ11.COM, designed after its &quot;big brother&quot; QRZ.com for amateur radio.

== Media ==
During the 1970s and 1980s peak years of CB radio, many citizens band-themed magazines appeared on newsstands. Two magazines that dominated the time period were &quot;S9 CB Radio&quot; and &quot;CB Radio Magazine&quot;. &quot;S9’&quot;s successor was &quot;Popular Communications&quot;, which had the same editor under a different publisher beginning in 1982. It covered hobby radio as well as CB. The same publisher produced a magazine called &quot;RADIO!&quot; for RadioShack stores in the mid-1990s. In Australia, &quot;CB Action Magazine&quot; was produced monthly from mid-1977 and continuing publication through until the early 1990s. &quot;CB Action&quot; spawned several other popular publications, including a communications and scanning magazine and &quot;Amateur Radio Action&quot; magazine, produced over several decades and running to some 18 volumes.

In the early 2000s, &quot;National Communications Magazine&quot; added CB radio coverage to its coverage of scanner radios and still remains the only magazine in North America covering CB radio.

<doc id="84715" wikidata="Q428940" url="?curid=84715" title="Mendeleev's predicted elements">
<text>Dmitri Mendeleev published a periodic table of the chemical elements in 1869 based on properties that appeared with some regularity as he laid out the elements from lightest to heaviest. When Mendeleev proposed his periodic table, he noted gaps in the table and predicted that then-unknown elements existed with properties appropriate to fill those gaps. He named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium, eka-silicon, and eka-manganese, with respective atomic masses of 44, 68, 72, and 100.

== Prefixes ==
To give provisional names to his predicted elements, Dmitri Mendeleev used the prefixes &quot;&quot;- , &quot;&quot;- or &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;-, from the Sanskrit names of digits 1, 2, and 3, depending upon whether the predicted element was one, two, or three places down from the known element of the same group in his table. For example, germanium was called eka-silicon until its discovery in 1886, and rhenium was called dvi-manganese before its discovery in 1926.

The &quot;eka-&quot; prefix was used by other theorists, and not only in Mendeleev&#x27;s own predictions. Before the discovery, francium was referred to as &quot;eka-caesium&quot;, and astatine as &quot;eka-iodine&quot;. Sometimes, eka- is still used to refer to some of the transuranic elements, for example, &quot;eka-radium&quot; for unbinilium. But current official IUPAC practice is to use a systematic element name based on the atomic number of the element as the provisional name, instead of being based on its position in the periodic table as these prefixes require.

== Original predictions ==
The four predicted elements lighter than the rare-earth elements, &quot;eka-boron&quot; (&quot;Eb&quot;, under boron, B, 5), &quot;eka-aluminium&quot; (&quot;Ea&quot; or &quot;El&quot;, under Al, 13), &quot;eka-manganese&quot; (&quot;Em&quot;, under Mn, 25), and &quot;eka-silicon&quot; (&quot;Es&quot;, under Si, 14), proved to be good predictors of the properties of scandium (Sc, 21), gallium (Ga, 31), technetium (Tc, 43), and germanium (Ge, 32) respectively, each of which fill the spot in the periodic table assigned by Mendeleev.

The names were written by Dmitri Mendeleev as (), (), (), and () respectively, following the pre-1917 Russian orthography.

Initial versions of the periodic table did not distinguish rare earth elements from transition elements, helping to explain both why Mendeleev&#x27;s predictions for heavier unknown elements did not fare as well as those for the lighter ones and why they are not as well known or documented.

Scandium oxide was isolated in late 1879 by Lars Fredrick Nilson; Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev late in that year. Mendeleev had predicted an atomic mass of 44 for eka-boron in 1871, while scandium has an atomic mass of 44.955907.

In 1871, Mendeleev predicted the existence of a yet-undiscovered element he named eka-aluminium (because of its proximity to aluminium in the periodic table). The table below compares the qualities of the element predicted by Mendeleev with actual characteristics of gallium, which was discovered, soon after Mendeleev predicted its existence, in 1875 by Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran.

Technetium was isolated by Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segrè in 1937, well after Mendeleev&#x27;s lifetime, from samples of molybdenum that had been bombarded with deuterium nuclei in a cyclotron by Ernest Lawrence. Mendeleev had predicted an atomic mass of 100 for eka-manganese in 1871, and the most stable isotopes of technetium are 97Tc and 98Tc.

Germanium was isolated in 1886 and provided the best confirmation of the theory up to that time, due to its contrasting more clearly with its neighboring elements than the two previously confirmed predictions of Mendeleev do with theirs.

== Other predictions ==

The existence of an element between thorium (90) and uranium (92) was predicted by Mendeleev in 1871. In 1900, William Crookes isolated protactinium (91) as a radioactive material deriving from uranium that he could not identify. Different isotopes of protactinium were identified in Germany in 1913 and in 1918, but the name &quot;protactinium&quot; was not given until 1948. Since the acceptance of Glenn T. Seaborg&#x27;s actinide concept in 1945, thorium, uranium and protactinium have been classified as actinides; hence, protactinium does not occupy the place of eka-tantalum (under 73) in group 5. Eka-tantalum is actually the synthetic superheavy element dubnium (105).

Mendeleev&#x27;s 1869 table had implicitly predicted a heavier analog of titanium (22) and zirconium (40), but in 1871 he placed lanthanum (57) in that spot. The 1923 discovery of hafnium (72) validated Mendeleev&#x27;s original 1869 prediction.

Some other predictions were unsuccessful because he failed to recognise the presence of the lanthanides in the sixth row.

In 1902, Bohuslav Brauner placed lanthanides in a special series instead of Mendeleev&#x27;s extra period, so he renamed Mendeleev&#x27;s tri-manganese as dvi-manganese and dvi-tellurium as eka-tellurium (polonium had already been discovered, but its chemical properties had not yet been studied). Dvi-caesium was renamed eka-caesium.

== Later predictions ==

In 1902, having accepted the evidence for elements helium and argon, Mendeleev placed these noble gases in Group 0 in his arrangement of the elements. As Mendeleev was doubtful of atomic theory to explain the law of definite proportions, he had no &quot;a priori&quot; reason to believe hydrogen was the lightest of elements, and suggested that a hypothetical lighter member of these chemically inert Group 0 elements could have gone undetected and be responsible for radioactivity. Currently some periodic tables of elements put lone neutrons in this place (see neutronium) but no such element has ever been detected.

The heavier of the hypothetical proto-helium elements Mendeleev identified with coronium, named by association with an unexplained spectral line in the Sun&#x27;s corona. A faulty calibration gave a wavelength of 531.68 nm, which was eventually corrected to 530.3 nm, which Grotrian and Edlén identified as originating from Fe XIV in 1939.

The lightest of the Group 0 gases, the first in the periodic table, was assigned a theoretical atomic mass between and . The kinetic velocity of this gas was calculated by Mendeleev to be 2,500,000 meters per second. Nearly massless, these gases were assumed by Mendeleev to permeate all matter, rarely interacting chemically. The high mobility and very small mass of the trans-hydrogen gases would result in the situation that they could be rarefied, yet appear to be very dense.

Mendeleev later published a theoretical expression of the ether in a small booklet entitled &quot;A Chemical Conception of the Ether&quot; (1904). His 1904 publication again contained two atomic elements smaller and lighter than hydrogen. He treated the &quot;ether gas&quot; as an interstellar atmosphere composed of at least two elements lighter than hydrogen. He stated that these gases originated due to violent bombardments internal to stars, the Sun being the most prolific source of such gases. According to Mendeleev&#x27;s booklet, the interstellar atmosphere was probably composed of several additional elemental species.

<doc id="84716" wikidata="Q2099776" url="?curid=84716" title="Pluto (mother of Tantalus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pluto or Plouto (Ancient Greek: Πλουτώ) was the mother of Tantalus, usually by Zeus, though the scholion to line 5 of Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Orestes&quot;, names Tmolos as the father. According to Hyginus, Pluto&#x27;s father was Himas, while other sources give her father as Cronus.

According to the &quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot;, the mother of Tantalus, called either Plutis or Plute, was the daughter of Atlas. Nonnus, calling her &quot;Berecyntian Pluto&quot;, associates her with Berecyntus, a mountain in Phrygia sacred to Cybele. Nonnus has Zeus, hurrying &quot;to Pluto&#x27;s bed&quot;, to sire Tantalus, hide his thunderbolts in a cave, which the monster Typhon found and stole, precipitating Typhon&#x27;s cataclysmic battle with Zeus.

<text>Jamil Abdullah al-Amin (born Hubert Gerold Brown; October 4, 1943), is an American Muslim cleric who was the fifth chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the 1960s. Best known as H. Rap Brown, he served as the Black Panther Party&#x27;s minister of justice during a short-lived (six months) alliance between SNCC and the Black Panther Party.

He is perhaps known for his proclamations during that period, such as, &quot;Violence is as American as cherry pie&quot;, and, &quot;If America don&#x27;t come around, we&#x27;re gonna burn it down.&quot; He is also known for his autobiography, &quot;Die Nigger Die!&quot;. He is currently serving a life sentence for murder following the shooting of two Fulton County, Georgia, sheriff&#x27;s deputies in 2000. 

==Activism==

Brown&#x27;s activism in the civil rights movement included involvement with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Brown was introduced into SNCC by his older brother Ed. He first visited Cambridge, Maryland with Cleveland Sellers in the summer of 1963, during the period of Gloria Richardson&#x27;s leadership in the local movement. He witnessed the first riot between whites and blacks in the city over civil rights issues, and was impressed by the local civil rights movement&#x27;s willingness to use armed self-defense against racial attacks.

Brown later organized for SNCC during the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer, while transferring to Howard University for his studies. Representing Howard&#x27;s SNCC chapter, Brown attended a contentious civil rights meeting at the White House with President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Selma crisis of 1965 as Alabama activists attempted to march for voting rights.

Major federal civil rights legislation was passed in 1964 and 1965, including the Voting Rights Act, to establish federal oversight and enforcement of rights. In 1966, Brown organized in Greene County, Alabama to achieve black voter registration and implementation of the recently passed Voting Rights Act.

Elected SNCC chairman in 1967, Brown continued Stokely Carmichael&#x27;s fiery support for &quot;Black Power&quot; and urban rebellions in the Northern ghettos.

During the summer of 1967, Brown toured the nation, calling for violent resistance to the government, which he called &quot;The Fourth Reich&quot;. &quot;Negroes should organize themselves&quot;, he told a rally in Washington, D.C., and &quot;carry on guerilla warfare in all the cities.&quot; They should, &quot;make the Viet Cong look like Sunday school teachers.&quot; He declared, &quot;I say to America, &quot;Fuck it! Freedom or death!&quot;&quot;

==Cambridge riot incident==

In this period, Cambridge, Maryland had an active civil rights movement, led by Gloria Richardson. In July 1967 Brown spoke in the city, saying &quot;It&#x27;s time for Cambridge to explode, baby. Black folks built America, and if America don&#x27;t come around, we&#x27;re going to burn America down.&quot; Gunfire reportedly broke out later, and both Brown and a police officer were wounded. A fire started that night and by the next day, 17 buildings were destroyed by an expanding fire &quot;in a two-block area of Pine Street, the center of African-American commerce, culture and community.&quot; Brown was charged with inciting a riot, due to his speech.

Brown was also charged with carrying a gun across state lines. A secret 1967 FBI memo had called for &quot;neutralizing&quot; Brown. He became a target of the agency&#x27;s COINTELPRO program, which was intended to disrupt and disqualify civil rights leaders. The federal charges against him were never proven.

He was defended in the gun violation case by civil rights advocates Murphy Bell of Baton Rouge, the self-described &quot;radical lawyer&quot; William Kunstler, and Howard Moore Jr., general counsel for SNCC. Feminist attorney Flo Kennedy also assisted Brown and led his defense committee, winning support for him from some chapters of the National Organization for Women.

The Cambridge fire was among incidents investigated by the 1967 Kerner Commission. But their investigative documents were not published with their 1968 report. Historian Dr. Peter Levy studied these papers in researching his book &quot;Civil War on Race Street: The Civil Rights Movement in Cambridge, Maryland&quot; (2003). He argues there was no riot in Cambridge. Brown was documented as completing his speech in Cambridge at 10 pm July 24, then walking a woman home. He was shot by a deputy sheriff allegedly without provocation. Brown was hastily treated for his injuries and secretly taken by supporters out of Cambridge.

Later that night a small fire broke out, but the police chief and fire company did not respond for two hours. In discussing his book, Levy has said that the fire&#x27;s spread and ultimate destructive cost appeared to be due not to a riot, but to the deliberate inaction of the Cambridge police and fire departments, which had hostile relations with the black community. In a later book, Levy notes that Brice Kinnamon, head of the Cambridge police department, said that the city had no racial problems, and that Brown was the &quot;sole&quot; cause of the disorder, and it was &quot;a well-planned Communist attempt to overthrow the government.&quot;

While being held for trial, Brown continued his high-profile activism. He accepted a request from the Student Afro-American Society of Columbia University to help represent and co-organize the April 1968 Columbia protests against university expansion into Harlem park land in order to build a gymnasium.

He also contributed writing from jail to the radical magazine &quot;Black Mask&quot;, which was edited and published by the New York activist group Up Against the Wall Motherfucker. In his 1968 article titled &quot;H. Rap Brown From Prison: Lasima Tushinde Mbilashika&quot;, Brown writes of going on a hunger strike and his willingness to give up his life in order to achieve change.

Brown&#x27;s trial was originally to take place in Cambridge, but there was a change of venue and the trial was moved to Bel Air, Maryland, to start in March 1970. On March 9, 1970, two SNCC officials, Ralph Featherstone and William (&quot;Che&quot;) Payne, died on U.S. Route 1 south of Bel Air, when a bomb on the front floorboard of their car exploded, killing both occupants. The bomb&#x27;s origin is disputed: some say the bomb was planted in an assassination attempt, and others say Payne was carrying it to the courthouse where Brown was to be tried. The next night, the Cambridge courthouse was bombed.

==1970 and later life==

Brown disappeared for 18 months. He was posted on the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted List. He was arrested after a reported shootout with officers in New York City following an alleged attempted robbery of a bar there. He was convicted of robbery and served five years (1971–76) in Attica Prison in western New York state. While in prison, Brown converted to Islam. He formally changed his name from Hubert Gerold Brown to Jamil Abdullah al-Amin.

After his release, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he opened a grocery store. He became an imam, a Muslim spiritual leader, in the National Ummah, one of the nation&#x27;s largest black Muslim groups. He also was a community activist in Atlanta&#x27;s West End neighborhood. He preached against drugs and gambling. It has since been suggested that al-Amin changed his life again when he became affiliated with the &quot;Dar ul-Islam Movement&quot;.

==2000 arrest and conviction==
On May 31, 1999, al-Amin was pulled over in Marietta, Georgia by police officer Johnny Mack for driving a suspected stolen vehicle. During a search, al-Amin was found to have in his pocket a police badge. He also had a bill of sale in his pocket, explaining his possession of the stolen car, and he claimed that he had been issued an honorary police badge by Mayor John Jackson, a statement which Jackson verified. Despite this, al-Amin was charged with speeding, auto theft and impersonating a police officer.

On March 16, 2000, in Fulton County, Georgia, Sheriff&#x27;s deputies Ricky Kinchen and Aldranon English went to al-Amin&#x27;s home to execute an arrest warrant for failing to appear in court over the charges. After determining that the home was unoccupied, the deputies drove away and were shortly passed by a black Mercedes headed for the house. Kinchen (the more senior deputy) noted the suspect vehicle, turned the patrol car around, and drove up to the Mercedes, stopping nose to nose. English approached the Mercedes and told the single occupant to show his hands. The occupant opened fire with a .223 rifle. English ran between the two cars while returning fire from his handgun, and was hit four times. Kinchen was shot with the rifle and a 9 mm handgun.

The next day, Kinchen died of his wounds at Grady Memorial Hospital. English survived his wounds. He identified al-Amin as the shooter from six photos he was shown while recovering in the hospital Another source said English identified him shortly before going into surgery for his wounds.

After the shootout, al-Amin fled Atlanta, going to White Hall, Alabama. He was tracked down by U.S. Marshals who started with a blood trail at the shooting site, and arrested by law enforcement officers after a four-day manhunt. Al-Amin was wearing body armor at the time of his arrest. He showed no wounds. Officers found a 9 mm handgun near his arrest site. Firearms identification testing showed that this was used to shoot Kinchen and English, but al-Amin&#x27;s fingerprints were not found on the weapon. Later, al-Amin&#x27;s black Mercedes was found with bullet holes in it.

His lawyers argued he was innocent of the shooting. Defense attorneys noted that al-Amin&#x27;s fingerprints were not found on the murder weapon, and he was not wounded in the shooting, as one of the deputies said the shooter was. A trail of blood found at the scene was tested and did not belong to al-Amin or either of the deputies. A test by the state concluded that it was animal blood, but these results have been disputed because there was no clear chain of custody to verify the sample and testing process. Deputy English had said that the killer&#x27;s eyes were gray, but al-Amin&#x27;s are brown.

At al-Amin&#x27;s trial, prosecutors noted that he had never provided an alibi for his whereabouts at the time of the shootout, nor any explanation for fleeing the state afterward. He also did not explain why the weapons used in the shootout were found near him during his arrest.

On March 9, 2002, nearly two years after the shootings, al-Amin was convicted of 13 criminal charges, including Kinchen&#x27;s murder and aggravated assault in shooting English. Four days later, he was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole (LWOP). He was sent to Georgia State Prison, the state&#x27;s maximum-security facility near Reidsville, Georgia.

Otis Jackson, a man incarcerated for unrelated charges, claimed that he committed the Fulton County shootings, and confessed this two years before al-Amin was convicted of the same crime. The court did not consider Jackson&#x27;s statement as evidence. Jackson&#x27;s statements corroborated details from 911 calls following the shooting, including a bleeding man seen limping from the scene: Jackson said he knocked on doors to solicit a ride while suffering from wounds sustained in the firefight with deputies Kinchen and English. Jackson recanted his statement two days after making it, but later confessed again in a sworn affidavit, stating that he had only recanted after prison guards threatened him for being a &quot;cop killer&quot;. Prosecutors refuted Jackson&#x27;s testimony, claiming he couldn&#x27;t have shot the deputies as he was wearing an ankle tag for house confinement that would have showed his location. Al-Amin&#x27;s lawyers allege that the tag was faulty.

Al-Amin appealed his conviction on the basis of a racial conspiracy against him, despite both Fulton County deputies being black. In May 2004, the Supreme Court of Georgia unanimously ruled to uphold al-Amin&#x27;s conviction.

In August 2007, al-Amin was transferred to federal custody, as Georgia officials decided he was too high-profile for the Georgia prison system to handle. He was first held in a holdover facility in the USP Atlanta; two weeks later he was moved to a federal transfer facility in Oklahoma, pending assignment to a federal penitentiary.

On October 21, 2007, al-Amin was transferred to ADX Florence, a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. He has been under an unofficial gag order, prevented from having any interviews with writers, journalists or biographers.

On July 18, 2014, having been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, al-Amin was transferred to Butner Federal Medical Center in North Carolina. , he is incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Tucson.

Al-Amin sought retrial through the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Investigative journalist, Hamzah Raza, has written more about Otis Jackson&#x27;s confession to the deputy shootings in 2000, and said that this evidence should have been considered by the court. It had the potential of exonerating al-Amin. However, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected his appeal on July 31, 2019.

In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from al-Amin. His family and supporters continue to petition for a new trial.

<text>In Greek mythology, Termerus (Ancient Greek: Τέρμερος) was a bandit who was killed by Heracles.

== Mythology ==
The episode is referenced in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Theseus&quot;, in description of Theseus&#x27; method of slaying his assailants by returning &quot;the same sort of violence that they offered to him,&quot; as Heracles killed Termerus by “breaking his skull in pieces&quot;. Hence, comes the proverb of &#x27;a Termerian mischief&#x27;. It seems Termerus killed passengers that he met by running with his head against them. 

According to Stephanus of Byzantium, Termerus was the eponym of the city Termera in Lycia. A scholiast on Euripides relates that Termera was founded by Termerus and took its name after him. The same source informs that Termerus and Lycus, two Lelegians &quot;of beastly nature&quot;, were said to be notorious robbers that raided Caria and also sailed as far as the island Kos for the same purpose. The saying &quot;Termerian mischief&quot; was accordingly inspired by their deeds. 

According to the dictionary Suda, the proverbial expression &quot;Termerian mischief&quot; () was due to a fortified dungeon located in Caria near Mount Termerion lying between Myndus and Halicarnassus.

<doc id="84721" wikidata="Q1246563" url="?curid=84721" title="Thalestris">
<text>According to the mythological Greek &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;, Queen Thalestris (; ) of the Amazons brought 300 women to Alexander the Great, hoping to breed a race of children as strong and intelligent as he. According to the legend, she stayed with the Macedonian king for 13 days and nights in the hope that the great warrior would father a daughter by her.

==Sources==
Several of Alexander&#x27;s biographers dispute the claim, including Plutarch, a highly regarded secondary source. He mentions fourteen authors, some of whom believed the story (Onesicritus, Cleitarchus), while others took it to be only fiction (Aristobulus of Cassandreia, Chares of Mytilene, Ptolemy I of Egypt, Duris of Samos).

Plutarch also mentions when Alexander&#x27;s secondary naval commander, Onesicritus, was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King Lysimachus of Thrace who was on the original expedition, the king smiled at him and said &quot;And where was I, then?&quot;

==Historicity==
The story is rejected by modern scholars as legendary. Perhaps behind the legend lies the offering by a Scythian king of his daughter as a wife for Alexander, as the latter himself wrote in a letter to Antipater.

Another possibility is the story was inspired by the contingent of 100 women warriors sent by Atropates to Alexander in 324 BCE. They were called Amazons, arriving on horse and carrying light battle axes and pelta shields. The king sent them back, fearing their presence might incite his male troops to molest them, but he gave them the message he would visit their queen to beget children by her, referencing the popular Amazon custom. These women have been interpreted as product of the Achaemenid custom to train female bodyguards, mere prostitutes playing roles, or true members of Eurasian tribes where women were trained for war, like Scythians themselves, It has been interpreted that Alexander sent her back not because they might be threatened, as his army was accustomed to travel with concubines, but because of the cultural clash of fighting along women.

==Modern references==
Thalestris is also the name of a character in Mary Renault&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The King Must Die&quot;, set in the time of the mythological Theseus, who lived - if he existed at all - a thousand years or more before Alexander. The Thalestris character is depicted by Renault as a skilled Amazonian bull-dancer and valiant warrior - which is presumably why the writer gave her the name of an Amazon queen.

In Alexander Pope’s mock heroic poem The Rape of the Lock, Thalestris is the name of a ‘fierce’ supporter of Belinda, whose lock of hair is stolen - a ‘Virago’ who urges Belinda into combat to regain the lock.

There is also a brief reference to the courtship between Alexander and Thalestris in Beaumarchais&#x27; &quot;Le Mariage De Figaro&quot;.
