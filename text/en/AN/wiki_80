<text>Tragopogon, also known as goatsbeard or salsify, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It includes the vegetable known as salsify, as well as a number of common wild flowers.

Salsifies are forbs growing as biennial or perennial plants. They have a strong taproot and milky sap. They generally have few branches, and those there are tend to be upright. Their leaves are somewhat grass-like. Flower colour varies within the genus, with some yellow species, and some bronze or purple. Seeds are achenes and are borne in a globe like that of a dandelion but larger, and are dispersed by the wind.

The salsifies are mostly natives of Europe and Asia, but several species have been introduced into North America and Australia and have spread widely there. There is one species sometimes considered native to North America, &quot;Tragopogon mirus&quot;, but it is in fact a hybrid of two non-native species.

Some of the more common species of &quot;Tragopogon&quot; are known, in the regions where they are most common, by the common names goat&#x27;s beard, goatsbeard, salsify, or common salsify, without further qualification. These names are therefore inherently ambiguous, and best avoided, or reserved for the genus collectively. In the species list below, the first common name given is the one that seems to be most widely used for that species and is not in significant use for any other species.

The vegetable called salsify is usually the root of the purple salsify, &quot;Tragopogon porrifolius&quot;; the root is described as having the taste of oysters (hence the alternative common name &quot;oyster plant&quot; for some species in this genus), but more insipid with a touch of sweetness. The young shoots of purple salsify can also be eaten, as well as young leaves . Other species are also used in the same way, including the black or Spanish salsify, &quot;Scorzonera hispanica&quot;, which is closely related though not a member of the genus &quot;Tragopogon&quot;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Tragopogon&quot; comes .

==Hybrid speciation==
Salsifies are one example where hybrid speciation has been observed. In the early 1900s, humans introduced three species of goatsbeard into North America. These species, the western salsify (&quot;T. dubius&quot;), the meadow salsify (&quot;T. pratensis&quot;), and the oyster plant (&quot;T. porrifolius&quot;), are now common in urban areas. In the 1950s, botanists found two new species in the regions of Idaho and Washington, where the three already known species overlapped. One new species, &quot;Tragopogon miscellus&quot;, is a tetraploid hybrid of &quot;T. dubius&quot; and &quot;T. pratensis&quot;. The other species, &quot;Tragopogon mirus&quot;, is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors were &quot;T. dubius&quot; and &quot;T. porrifolius&quot;. These new species are usually referred to as &quot;the Ownbey hybrids&quot; after the botanist who first described them. The &quot;T. mirus&quot; population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, but additional episodes of hybrid speciation continue to add to the &quot;T. mirus&quot; population.

==Species==
;Accepted species

;Formerly included
The following species were once included in &quot;Tragopogon&quot; and are now regarded as better suited to other genera: &quot;Agoseris, Geropogon, Krigia, Lasiospora, Nothocalais, Podospermum, Scorzonera, Taraxacum, and Urospermum.&quot;

<doc id="82673" wikidata="Q738706" url="?curid=82673" title="John Ruiz">
<text>John Ruiz (born January 4, 1972) is an American former professional boxer who competed from 1992 to 2010, and held the WBA heavyweight title twice between 2001 and 2005. Ruiz is of Puerto Rican descent, and is the first Latino boxer to win a world heavyweight title.

==Amateur career==
* 1991: Competed as a light heavyweight at the World Championships in Sydney, Australia. Results were:
** Defeated Mohamed Benguesmia (Algeria) PTS (22–11)
** Defeated Miodrag Radulovic (Yugoslavia) RSC-3
** Lost to Andrey Kurnyavka (Soviet Union) PTS (14–20)
* 1992: Competed at the Olympic Trials in Worcester. Result was:
** Lost to Jeremy Williams PTS

==Professional career==
===First reign as WBA heavyweight champion===
After Lennox Lewis defeated Evander Holyfield for the undisputed (WBA, WBC, and IBF) heavyweight title in late 1999, the WBA ordered Lewis to defend the title against mandatory challenger Ruiz, but Lewis refused. Though he had been undefeated since his 1st round 19 second loss against David Tua in 1996, the level of competition Ruiz had been facing was suspect and the only name he had beaten (to date) was a nearly 40-year-old Tony Tucker.

Ruiz and his management sued, claiming that WBA rules entitled him to a title shot. A judge agreed, but rather than face Ruiz in a bout that was seen as commercially unattractive, Lewis instead fought Michael Grant, considered to be a very worthy contender at the time, having knocked out a series of recognized &quot;name&quot; opponents on HBO. After learning of this, the judge decreed that upon entering the ring against Grant on April 29, 2000, Lewis would automatically forfeit the WBA title.

===Ruiz vs. Holyfield===

Ruiz fought former champion Holyfield to fill the vacancy on August 12, 2000, losing by unanimous decision (this result made Holyfield the first to win a world heavyweight title on four occasions). Many observers and boxing reporters felt that the underdog Ruiz had done enough to win.

Due to this controversial decision, the WBA ordered an immediate rematch in early 2001, and Ruiz won the WBA title. Some critics still believe the decision was controversial (Ruiz was on the ground for a few minutes after Holyfield appeared to deliver a low punch to the groin). Footage following the match showed that the punch may have been legal, but it wasn&#x27;t disputed.

Ruiz defended the title twice: a controversial draw in a third match against Holyfield where the press believed Holyfield to have won, and a disqualification victory against Kirk Johnson where the Canadian contender was disqualified for repeated low blows in the tenth round. Ruiz was accused in both the second Holyfield fight and the Johnson fight of faking low blows that actually seemed to be closer to his beltline than his groin (although Johnson was shown on replays to hit Ruiz below the belt several times).

===Ruiz vs Jones Jr.===

On March 1, 2003, Ruiz was contracted to fight Roy Jones Jr., who at the time was &quot;The Ring&quot; light heavyweight champion. If Jones was to beat Ruiz in the fight, he would join Bob Fitzsimmons, Michael Spinks, and Michael Moorer as the only three fighters to win titles at light heavyweight and heavyweight as well as becoming the second fighter (Fitzsimmons being the first) to win titles at both middleweight and heavyweight. Ruiz, who said referee Jay Nady &quot;wouldn&#x27;t let me fight my fight&quot;, lost a unanimous decision to Jones and moved back into the WBA&#x27;s contender pool.

===Second reign as WBA heavyweight champion===

Ruiz, however, would receive another shot before 2003 was out. As champion Jones was required to face the WBA&#x27;s number one contender, former WBO champion Vitali Klitschko. Neither the Jones nor the Klitschko camps were able to agree to a fight by an imposed deadline, so Jones became a champion-in-recess. Klitschko, however, did not want to fight the #2 contender, former WBC, IBF, and lineal champion Hasim Rahman, for the interim championship. After David Tua, the #3 contender, also turned down the fight against Rahman, Ruiz, the #5 contender and the only one interested in the fight, decided to accept. He fought Rahman on December 13, 2003, and with a unanimous decision victory became the WBA&#x27;s interim champion. When Jones announced on February 24, 2004, that he would return to competing in the light heavyweight division, the WBA took the interim tag off Ruiz, and he became an official two-time WBA heavyweight champion.

On April 17, 2004, Ruiz fought the first defense of his second world title. He retained it with an eleventh-round technical knockout of Fres Oquendo at Madison Square Garden. This fight was historic in that it was the first time two Hispanics/Latinos faced each other for a version of world heavyweight title.

On November 13 of that same year, Ruiz retained the belt with a controversial unanimous decision over Polish-American Andrew Golota – among other things he suffered two knockdowns and a one-point deduction by referee Randy Neumann. Ruiz vs Golota was the Main event of Don King&#x27;s Night of Heavyweights card, it did 120,000 Pay-Per-View buys

On April 30, 2005, Ruiz lost the title to James &quot;Lights Out&quot; Toney in Madison Square Garden by unanimous decision, marking the second time that Ruiz had lost to a former middleweight champion. Frustrated by years of criticism from the boxing press and fans, he retired upon his second loss of the WBA title on April 30, 2005 (to James &quot;Lights-Out&quot; Toney).

However, after Toney failed the post-match drug test (for stanozolol, an anabolic steroid), the New York Athletic Commission suspended him from boxing in the United States for 90 days, and fined him $10,000 (U.S.). The WBA banned the aging (then 36 years old) Toney from fighting for its heavyweight title for the next two years. This resulted in Toney&#x27;s win being changed to a &quot;no contest&quot;—basically, a nullification which also reinstated Ruiz as champion. Ruiz came out of retirement after just ten days of his initial announcement, before it was found out that Toney would be suspended and he would be reinstated as champion. Ruiz then filed a lawsuit against Toney, claiming that he had damaged Ruiz&#x27;s boxing career (due to Toney&#x27;s use of illegal steroids before their bout).

===Controversial loss to Valuev===

On December 17, 2005, Ruiz lost the WBA Championship in Berlin to 7 ft. tall, 324-lb. Russian Nikolai Valuev. The official outcome was a majority decision (scored 114–116, 113–116, and 114–114), but it was also a controversial one. Ruiz was convinced that his jab/combination-punch technique had given him a clear victory. He demanded that his promoter, Don King, set up an immediate re-match with the now-first-ever Russian world heavyweight champion. Ruiz&#x27;s long-time manager, Norman Stone, declared that they would also formally petition the WBA: after all, the 10,000 German spectators booed when the decision was announced. Ruiz&#x27;s camp claimed that the Germans booed because they too felt that the outcome was unjust. Wilfried Sauerland, the manager who rescued Valuev&#x27;s career from obscurity two years earlier, angrily countered that the fans had booed because Stone&#x27;s in-ring behavior had agitated them.

In September 2006 Ruiz announced that he would be managed by Sauerland. His former manager Norman Stone retired on December 22, 2005, stating that the decision in the loss to Valuev was the last straw, and he would continue to support Ruiz from retirement.

===Road back to title contention===
After the loss Don King announced his intention to still promote Ruiz. King had become aware of Ruiz after his KO win over the former IBF title holder Tony Tucker in 1998. Ruiz followed up the loss to Valuev with a fight against up-and-coming contender Ruslan Chagaev. In a close fight, Chagaev prevailed, taking a split decision with scores of 117–111 and 116–112 for Chagaev, and 115–114 for Ruiz. Chagaev became the mandatory challenger for a shot at Valuev, whom he defeated on April 14, 2007, to claim the WBA heavyweight championship.

===Another comeback===
Ruiz faced Otis Tisdale on October 13, 2007, and ended the fight with a TKO victory in the second round as referee Pete Podgorski called a halt to the bout as Tisdale went down for the third time. The bout was scheduled for 10 rounds. On March 8, 2008, Ruiz won a 12-round unanimous decision over Jameel McCline in Mexico.

===Ruiz vs. Valuev II===

Valuev defeated Ruiz by unanimous decision on August 30, 2008. Scores were 114–113, 116–113, and 116–111. The result was initially declared a split decision win for Valuev. The 114–113 score by ringside judge Takeshi Shimakawa was announced in favor of Ruiz. Shimakawa alerted WBA officials after that his score was intended for Valuev. One of the scorecards had the names of the fighters in opposite order, resulting in the confusion.

The decision was once again unpopular with the live crowd as some booed the outcome, much like the first match in December 2005.

===Final world title shot===

After petitioning the WBA to protest against the outcome of his controversial fight with Valuev, Ruiz was made the WBA&#x27;s mandatory challenger to fight the winner of Chagaev-Valuev II in 2009. As that bout was cancelled, Ruiz stepped aside as mandatory challenger so Valuev could fight Cruiserweight Champion David Haye. On the undercard to that fight Ruiz stopped Adnan Serin in 7 rounds. Ruiz, coming in at 226 pounds (his lightest since 2001), dominated his overmatched opponent to retain his mandatory challenge to the WBA belt. Valuev later lost a majority decision to David Haye, meaning Ruiz would now fight Haye for the WBA title, after Haye had recovered from a hand injury. When the fight took place on April 3, 2010 at the M.E.N. Arena in Manchester, Ruiz lost to Haye by TKO when his corner threw in the towel in the ninth round after suffering four knockdowns in the previous rounds. Ruiz, whose face was covered in blood, could not stand up to Haye&#x27;s greater speed and power.

===Retirement===
Following his loss to David Haye, Ruiz announced his retirement after an 18-year boxing career. He finished with a professional record of 44–9–1–1, with 30 knockouts. In 2013, he opened Quietman Sports Gym in Medford, Massachusetts, offering both boxing and MMA (mixed martial arts) training to all ages. While all ages are welcome, he focuses on providing an alternative for at-risk children and teenagers in the Greater Boston area. He has also indicated that he wants to return to boxing in some capacity as either a manager or trainer at some point. In 2014, boxing.com ranked Ruiz as number 83 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Heavyweights of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="82683" wikidata="Q1332266" url="?curid=82683" title="Elliot S. Maggin">
<text>Elliot S. Maggin, also spelled Elliot S! Maggin (born 1950), is an American writer of comic books, film, television, and novels. He was a main writer for DC Comics during the Bronze and early Modern ages of comics in the 1970s and 1980s. He is particularly associated with the character of Superman.

He has been active with the Democratic Party of the United States, twice running for the nomination of his party for the U.S. House of Representatives—once from New Hampshire&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in 1984 and from California&#x27;s 24th congressional district in 2008.

==Career==
===DC Comics===
Maggin started working as a professional writer in his teens, selling historical stories about the Boer War to a boys&#x27; magazine. He attended Brandeis University, where he wrote a term paper titled &quot;What Can One Man Do?&quot; for a class during his junior year. When it received a grade of B+, Maggin disagreed with the assessment, remade it as a comic book script, and sent his script to DC Comics. It was passed around the DC offices, and Neal Adams chose to draw the script. The story was published in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #87 (Dec. 1971-Jan. 1972). &quot;Green Lantern&quot; editor Julius Schwartz commented that &quot;I’ve been a comix editor for over 27 years and never... have I ever come across a ‘first-time’ script... that can come within a light-year of equaling ‘What Can One Man Do?’ in professional slickness and comix know-how. ... Indeed, to equalize this thrilling experience, I must go back three decades when, as a literary agent, I sold the very first story of a young Ray Bradbury!&quot; Though the initial grade was not amended, Maggin became a writer for DC.

During Maggin&#x27;s time at Brandeis, he befriended the university&#x27;s vice-president, meeting his family. During one of the meetings, the vice-president&#x27;s stepson (and future comic book writer) Jeph Loeb suggested a story that would eventually be called &quot;Must There Be a Superman?&quot;. Maggin used the idea, which became his initial foray into the Superman franchise, and it was published in &quot;Superman&quot; #247 (Jan. 1972). He wrote Green Arrow stories as well, where his sense of humor was allowed far more freedom in the loose dialogue of the main character.

&quot;Superman&quot; #300 (June 1976) featured an out-of-continuity story by Maggin and Cary Bates which imagined the infant Superman landing on Earth in 1976 and becoming a superhero in 2001. The tale was an inspiration for Mark Millar&#x27;s &quot;&quot; limited series published in 2003. He was the initial writer of the &quot;Batman Family&quot; title and paired Batgirl and Robin together as a team in the first issue (Sept.-Oct. 1975) Maggin wrote a licensed &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; comic book series which was based on the popular ABC sitcom. His credits for Marvel Comics include an adaptation of &quot;The Iliad&quot; in &quot;Marvel Classics Comics&quot; #26 (1977), and two superhero tales, &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #16 (March 1978) and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #230 (Dec. 1978). The first issue of &quot;DC Graphic Novel&quot; featured an adaptation of the &quot;Star Raiders&quot; video game by Maggin and artist José Luis García-López.
Maggin wrote &quot;Superman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1984) which featured work by several popular comics artists including the only major DC work by Jim Steranko as well as an introduction by noted science-fiction author Ray Bradbury. Maggin&#x27;s contributions to the DC Multiverse include Superboy-Prime and Lexcorp. His last Superman story, &quot;...And We Are the Dreamers of the Dreams!&quot;, appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #420 (June 1986), and he was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series in that same year.

Maggin served as an editor for DC from 1989 to 1991 and oversaw the licensed TSR titles &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot;, &quot;Avatar&quot;, &quot;Dragonlance&quot;, &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, &quot;Gammarauders&quot;, and &quot;Spelljammer&quot;. He edited the &quot;Challengers of the Unknown&quot; limited series which was written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale.

====Origin of professional name====
Because comic book scripts tend to favor the exclamation mark as the punctuation of choice, Maggin routinely used it instead of a period. Out of habit, he once signed his own name &quot;Elliot S! Maggin&quot; and editor Julius Schwartz liked the distinctive rhythm of the name, insisting that Maggin&#x27;s name henceforth be written that way. Explaining in an interview:
===Beyond comic books===
In addition to the hundreds of stories Maggin wrote for the DC comics universe, he has written television scripts, stories for film, animation and journalistic pieces. Many of them have continued to show his allegiance to comic book characters. He wrote two Superman novels, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Miracle Monday&quot;. He wrote the novelization of the graphic novel &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; based on the story by Mark Waid, and a novel featuring the Marvel mutant superhero team &quot;Generation X&quot;. He has occasionally sold scripts to non-print versions of superheroes, including &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994), &quot;X-Men&quot; (1992), and &quot;&quot;.

Besides his work in comics, he has received compensation for raising horses, skiing instruction, teaching at various high schools and colleges, writing stories for Atari video games, and working on websites. As of 2008, he had worked for several years as a developmental learning consultant for Kaiser Permanente.

===Politics===
In 1984, Maggin first ran for political office as a candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives in New Hampshire&#x27;s 2nd congressional district but was defeated in the Democratic primary. After the election, the campaign was the subject of a lawsuit brought by the Federal Election Commission, in which his campaign treasurer and the committee itself had to pay fines for failing to submit a 1984 quarterly report.

Maggin was the Democratic nominee for a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1990. He was defeated by the Republican incumbent.

On May 21, 2007, Maggin announced that he would be running for the 2008 Democratic party nomination for California&#x27;s 24th congressional district seat. On February 1, 2008, Maggin posted on the main page of his website that he had decided not to run after all, effectively ending his 2008 campaign. In an essay written the following day, he cited principally financial reasons for his withdrawal. It appears that at no point during this campaign did he ever officially file with the Federal Election Commission.

Maggin&#x27;s campaign received the endorsement of fellow comics writer Tony Isabella.

====Electoral history====
New Hampshire District 2 September 11, 1984 Democratic primary election result
New York State Assembly District 19 November 6, 1990 General election
===E-publishing===
Several of his works of fiction are available exclusively online, including the short story &quot;Luthor&#x27;s Gift&quot; and the novella &quot;Starwinds Howl&quot;, both of which take place in his Superman continuity. He has presented a novel-in-progress, &quot;Lancer&quot;, on his personal website.

He also set up a podcast called &quot;Elliot Makes Stuff Up&quot;, where he did audiobook readings of his Superman novels.

==Personal life==
In 1983, Maggin married Pamela King. The two subsequently divorced in 1988, though they remarried three years later in 1991. They were divorced again in 2011. The couple has two children together, Sarah and Jeremy.

==Comic book appearances==
Maggin is himself a character in the DC Universe. During the Bronze Age of Comic Books, Maggin was a known resident of Earth-Prime and a major character in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; issues #123-124. In the Modern Age of Comic Books, Maggin cameoed as Oliver Queen&#x27;s campaign manager in &quot;52&quot;. This appearance references a term paper which had been awarded a B− at Brandeis University and was Maggin&#x27;s first sale to DC, which posited Green Arrow&#x27;s mayoral campaign in Star City.

==Awards==
Maggin received an Inkpot Award at San Diego Comic-Con in 2013. In 2016, he received the Bill Finger Award.

<text>Hoag&#x27;s Object is an unusual ring galaxy in the constellation of Serpens Caput. It is named after Arthur Hoag, who discovered it in 1950 and identified it as either a planetary nebula or a peculiar galaxy. The galaxy has a D25 isophotal diameter of .

==Characteristics==
A nearly perfect ring of young hot blue stars circles the older yellow nucleus of this ring galaxy c. 600 million light-years away in the constellation Serpens. The ring structure is so perfect and circular that it has been referred to as &quot;The most perfect ring galaxy&quot;. The diameter of the 6 arcsecond inner core of the galaxy is about () while the surrounding ring has an inner 28″ diameter of () and an outer 45″ diameter of (). The galaxy is estimated to have a mass of 700 billion suns. By comparison, the Milky Way galaxy has an estimated diameter of 150–200 kly and consists of between 100 and 500 billion stars and a mass between 800 billion and 1.54 trillion suns.

The gap separating the two stellar populations may contain some star clusters that are almost too faint to see. Though ring galaxies are rare, another more distant ring galaxy (SDSS J151713.93+213516.8) can be seen through Hoag&#x27;s Object, between the nucleus and the outer ring of the galaxy, at roughly the one o&#x27;clock position in the image shown here.

Noah Brosch and colleagues showed that the luminous ring lies at the inner edge of a much larger neutral hydrogen ring.

A few other galaxies share the primary characteristics of Hoag&#x27;s Object, including a bright detached ring of stars, but their centers are elongated or barred, and they may exhibit some spiral structure. While none matches Hoag&#x27;s Object in symmetry, these galaxies are sometimes called Hoag-type galaxies.

==History and formation==

Even though Hoag&#x27;s Object was clearly shown on the Palomar Star Survey, it was not included in either the &quot;Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies&quot;, the &quot;Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies&quot;, or the &quot;catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae&quot;.

In the initial announcement of his discovery, Hoag proposed the hypothesis that the visible ring was a product of gravitational lensing. This idea was later discarded because the nucleus and the ring have the same redshift, and because more advanced telescopes revealed the ring&#x27;s knotty structure, which would not be visible if the galaxy were a product of gravitational lensing.

Many of the galaxy&#x27;s details remain mysterious, foremost of which is how it formed. So-called &quot;classic&quot; ring galaxies are generally formed by the collision of a small galaxy with a larger disk-shaped galaxy, producing a density wave in the disk that leads to a characteristic ring-like appearance. Such an event would have happened at least 2–3 billion years ago, and may have resembled the processes that form polar-ring galaxies. However, there is no sign of any second galaxy that would have acted as the &quot;bullet&quot;, and the likely older core of Hoag&#x27;s Object has a very low velocity relative to the ring, making the typical formation hypothesis implausible. Observations with one of the most sensitive telescopes have also failed to uncover any faint galaxy fragments that should be observable in a collision scenario. However, a team of scientists that analyzes the galaxy admits that &quot;if the carnage happened more than 3 billion years ago, there might not be any detritus left to see.&quot;

Noah Brosch suggested that Hoag&#x27;s Object might be a product of an extreme &quot;bar instability&quot; that occurred a few billion years ago in a barred spiral galaxy. Schweizer &quot;et al&quot; claim this is an unlikely hypothesis because the nucleus of the object is spheroidal, whereas the nucleus of a barred spiral galaxy is disc-shaped, among other reasons. However, they admit evidence is somewhat thin for this particular dispute to be settled satisfactorily.

<text>Romain Gary (; 2 December 1980), born Roman Kacew (, and also known by the pen name Émile Ajar), was a French novelist, diplomat, film director, and World War II aviator. He is the only author to have won the Prix Goncourt twice (once under pseudonym). He is considered a major writer of French literature of the second half of the 20th century. He was married to Lesley Blanch, then Jean Seberg.

== Early life ==
Gary was born Roman Kacew ( &quot;Roman Katsev&quot;, , &quot;Roman Leibovich Katsev&quot;) in Vilnius (at that time in the Russian Empire). In his books and interviews, he presented many different versions of his parents&#x27; origins, ancestry, occupation and his own childhood. His mother, Mina Owczyńska (1879—1941), was a Jewish actress from Švenčionys (Svintsyán) and his father was a businessman named Arieh-Leib Kacew (1883—1942) from Trakai (Trok), also a Lithuanian Jew. The couple divorced in 1925 and Arieh-Leib remarried. Gary later claimed that his actual father was the celebrated actor and film star Ivan Mosjoukine, with whom his actress mother had worked and to whom he bore a striking resemblance. Mosjoukine appears in his memoir &quot;Promise at Dawn&quot;. Deported to central Russia in 1915, they stayed in Moscow until 1920. They later returned to Vilnius, then moved on to Warsaw. When Gary was fourteen, he and his mother emigrated illegally to Nice, France. Gary studied law, first in Aix-en-Provence and then in Paris. He learned to pilot an aircraft in the French Air Force in Salon-de-Provence and in Avord Air Base, near Bourges.

==Career==
Despite completing all parts of his course successfully, Gary was the only one of almost 300 cadets in his class not to be commissioned as an officer. He believed the military establishment was distrustful of him because he was a foreigner and a Jew. Training on Potez 25 and Goëland Léo-20 aircraft, and with 250 hours flying time, only after three months&#x27; delay was he made a sergeant on 1 February 1940. Lightly wounded on 13 June 1940 in a Bloch MB.210, he was disappointed with the armistice; after hearing General de Gaulle&#x27;s radio appeal, he decided to go to England. After failed attempts, he flew to Algiers from Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque in a Potez. Made adjutant upon joining the Free French and serving on Bristol Blenheims, he saw action across Africa and was promoted to second lieutenant. He returned to England to train on Boston IIIs. On 25 January 1944, his pilot was blinded, albeit temporarily, and Gary talked him to the bombing target and back home, the third landing being successful. This and the subsequent BBC interview and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspaper article were an important part of his career. He finished the war as a captain in the London offices of the Free French Air Forces. As a bombardier-observer in the &quot;Groupe de bombardement Lorraine&quot; (No. 342 Squadron RAF), he took part in over 25 successful sorties, logging over 65 hours of air time. During this time, he changed his name to Romain Gary. He was decorated for his bravery in the war, receiving many medals and honours, including Compagnon de la Libération and commander of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. In 1945 he published his first novel, &quot;Éducation européenne&quot;. Immediately following his service in the war, he worked in the French diplomatic service in Bulgaria and Switzerland. In 1952 he became the secretary of the French Delegation to the United Nations. In 1956, he became Consul General in Los Angeles and became acquainted with Hollywood.

=== As Émile Ajar ===
In a memoir published in 1981, Paul Pavlowitch claimed that Gary also produced several works under the pseudonym Émile Ajar. Gary recruited Pavlowitch – his cousin&#x27;s son – to portray Ajar in public appearances, allowing Gary to remain unknown as the true producer of the Ajar works, and thus enabling him to win the 1975 Goncourt Prize (a second win in violation of the prize&#x27;s rules).

Gary also published under the pseudonyms Shatan Bogat and Fosco Sinibaldi.

===Literary work===
Gary became one of France&#x27;s most popular and prolific writers, writing more than 30 novels, essays and memoirs, some of which he wrote under a pseudonym.

He is the only person to win the Prix Goncourt twice. This prize for French language literature is awarded only once to an author. Gary, who had already received the prize in 1956 for &quot;Les racines du ciel&quot;, published &quot;La vie devant soi&quot; under the pseudonym Émile Ajar in 1975. The Académie Goncourt awarded the prize to the author of that book without knowing his identity. Gary&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s son Paul Pavlowitch posed as the author for a time. Gary later revealed the truth in his posthumous book &quot;Vie et mort d&#x27;Émile Ajar&quot;. Gary also published as Shatan Bogat, René Deville and Fosco Sinibaldi, as well under his birth name Roman Kacew.

In addition to his success as a novelist, he wrote the screenplay for the motion picture &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and co-wrote and directed the film Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! (1971), which starred his wife at the time, Jean Seberg. In 1979, he was a member of the jury at the 29th Berlin International Film Festival.

=== Diplomatic career ===
After the end of the hostilities, Gary began a career as a diplomat in the service of France, in consideration of his contribution to the liberation of the country. In this capacity, he held positions in Bulgaria (1946–1947), Paris (1948–1949), Switzerland (1950–1951), New York (1951–1954) at the Permanent Mission of France to the United Nations. Here, he regularly rubbed shoulders with the Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin, whose personality deeply marked him and inspired him, particularly for the character of Father Tassin in &quot;Les Racines du ciel&quot;. He was positioned in London 1955, and as Consul General of France in Los Angeles 1956–1960. Back in Paris, he remained unassigned until he was laid off from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1961).

==Personal life and final years==

Gary&#x27;s first wife was the British writer, journalist, and &quot;Vogue&quot; editor Lesley Blanch, author of &quot;The Wilder Shores of Love&quot;. They married in 1944 and divorced in 1961. From 1962 to 1970, Gary was married to American actress Jean Seberg, with whom he had a son, Alexandre Diego Gary. According to Diego Gary, he was a distant presence as a father: &quot;Even when he was around, my father wasn&#x27;t there. Obsessed with his work, he used to greet me, but he was elsewhere.&quot;

After learning that Jean Seberg had had an affair with Clint Eastwood, Gary challenged him to a duel, but Eastwood declined.

Gary died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on 2 December 1980 in Paris. He left a note which said that his death had no relation to Seberg&#x27;s suicide the previous year. He also stated in his note that he was Émile Ajar.

Gary was cremated in Père Lachaise Cemetery and his ashes were scattered in the Mediterranean Sea near Roquebrune-Cap-Martin.

== Legacy ==
The name of Romain Gary was given to a promotion of the École nationale d&#x27;administration (2003–2005), the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Lille (2013), the Institut régional d&#x27;administration de Lille (2021–2022) and the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Strasbourg (2001–2002), in 2006 at Place Romain-Gary in the 15th arrondissement of Paris and at the Nice Heritage Library. The French Institute in Jerusalem also bears the name of Romain Gary.

On 16 May 2019, his work appeared in two volumes in the Bibliothèque de la Pléiade under the direction of Mireille Sacotte.

In 2007, a statue of Romualdas Kvintas, «The Boy with a Galoche», was unveiled, depicting the 9-year-old little hero of the Promise of Dawn, preparing to eat a shoe to seduce his little neighbor, Valentina. It is placed in Vilnius, in front of the Basanavičius, where the novelist lived.

A plaque to his name is affixed in the Pouillon building of the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Aix-Marseille where he studied.

In 2022, Denis Ménochet portrayed Gary in &quot;White Dog (Chien blanc)&quot;, a film adaptation by Anaïs Barbeau-Lavalette of Gary&#x27;s 1970 book.

<text>A novella is a narrative prose fiction whose length is shorter than most novels, but longer than most novelettes and short stories. The English word &quot;novella&quot; derives from the Italian meaning a short story related to true (or apparently so) facts. 

==Definition==
The Italian term is a feminine of &quot;novello&quot;, which means &quot;new&quot;, similarly to the English word &quot;news&quot;. Merriam-Webster defines a novella as &quot;a work of fiction intermediate in length and complexity between a short story and a novel&quot;.
There is disagreement regarding the number of pages or words necessary for a story to be considered a novella, a short story or a novel. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association defines a novella&#x27;s word count to be between 17,500 and 40,000 words; at 250 words per page, this equates to 70 to 160 pages. See below for definitions used by other organisations. 

==History==
The novella as a literary genre began developing in the Italian literature of the early Renaissance, principally by Giovanni Boccaccio, author of &quot;The Decameron&quot; (1353). &quot;The Decameron&quot; featured 100 tales (named novellas) told by ten people (seven women and three men) fleeing the Black Death, by escaping from Florence to the Fiesole hills in 1348. This structure was then imitated by subsequent authors, notably the French queen Marguerite de Navarre, whose &quot;Heptaméron&quot; (1559) included 72 original French tales and was modeled after the structure of &quot;The Decameron&quot;.

The Italian genre novella grew out of a rich tradition of medieval short narrative forms. It took its first major form in the anonymous late 13th century &quot;Libro di novelle et di bel parlar gentile&quot;, known as &quot;Il Novellino&quot;, and reached its culmination with &quot;The Decameron&quot;. Followers of Boccaccio such as Giovanni Fiorentino, Franco Sacchetti, Giovanni Sercambi and Simone de&#x27; Prodenzani continued the tradition into the early 15th century. The Italian novella influenced many later writers, including Shakespeare.

Novellas were also written in Spain. Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; book &quot;Novelas ejemplares&quot; (1613) added innovation to the genre with more attention to the depiction of human character and social background. 

Not until the late 18th and early 19th centuries did writers fashion the novella into a literary genre structured by precepts and rules, generally in a realistic mode. At that time, the Germans were the most active writers of the &quot;novelle&quot; (German: &quot;Novelle&quot;; plural: &quot;Novellen&quot;). For the German writer, a novella is a fictional narrative of indeterminate length—a few pages to hundreds—restricted to a single, suspenseful event, situation, or conflict leading to an unexpected turning point (&quot;Wendepunkt&quot;), provoking a logical but surprising end. &quot;Novellen&quot; tend to contain a concrete symbol, which is the narrative&#x27;s focal point.

The novella influenced the development of the short story and the novel throughout Europe. In the late 19th century Henry James was one of the first English language critics to use the term novella for a story that was longer and more complex than a short story, but shorter than a novel.

In English speaking countries the modern &quot;novella&quot; is rarely defined as a distinct literary genre, but is often used as a term for a short novel.

==Characteristics==
A novella generally features fewer conflicts than a novel, yet more complex conflicts than a short story. The conflicts also have more time to develop than in short stories. Novellas may or may not be divided into chapters (good examples of those with chapters are &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell and &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; by H. G. Wells), and white space is often used to divide the sections, something less common in short stories. Novellas may be intended to be read at a single sitting, like short stories, and thus produce a unitary effect on the reader. According to Warren Cariou, &quot;The novella is generally not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is a hallmark of the short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.

===Versus novel===
The term &quot;novel&quot;, borrowed from the Italian &quot;novella&quot;, originally meant &quot;any of a number of tales or stories making up a larger work; a short narrative of this type, a fable&quot;, and was then many times used in the plural, reflecting the usage as in &quot;The Decameron&quot; and its followers. Usage of the more italianate &quot;novella&quot; in English seems to be a bit younger. The differentiation of the two terms seems to have occurred only in the 19th century, following the new fashion of the novella in German literature. In 1834, John Lothrop Motley could still speak of &quot;Tieck&#x27;s novels (which last are a set of exquisite little tales, novels in the original meaning of the word)&quot;. But when the term &quot;novella&quot; was used it was already clear that a rather short and witty form was intended: &quot;The brief Novella has ever been a prodigious favorite with the nation…since the days of Boccaccio.&quot; In 1902, William Dean Howells wrote: &quot;Few modern fictions of the novel&#x27;s dimensions…have the beauty of form many a novella embodies.&quot;

Sometimes, as with other genres, the genre name is mentioned in the title of a single work (compare the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; or Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Das Märchen&quot;). Austrian writer Stefan Zweig&#x27;s &quot;Die Schachnovelle&quot; (1942) (literally, &quot;The Chess Novella&quot;, but translated in 1944 as &quot;The Royal Game&quot;) is an example of a title naming its genre. This might be suggestive of the genre&#x27;s historicization.

Commonly, longer novellas are referred to as novels; Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; (1886) and Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1899) are sometimes called novels, as are many science fiction works such as H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; (1897) and Philip Francis Nowlan&#x27;s &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; (1928). Less often, longer works are referred to as novellas. The subjectivity of the parameters of the novella genre is indicative of its shifting and diverse nature as an art form. In her 2010 &quot;Open Letters Monthly&quot; series, &quot;A Year With Short Novels&quot;, Ingrid Norton criticizes the tendency to make clear demarcations based purely on a book&#x27;s length, saying that &quot;any distinctions that begin with an objective and external quality like size are bound to be misleading.&quot;

Stephen King, in his introduction to &quot;Different Seasons&quot;, a 1982 collection of four novellas, notes the difficulties of selling a novella in the commercial publishing world, since it does not fit the typical length requirements of either magazine or book publishers. Despite these problems, however, the novella&#x27;s length provides unique advantages; in the introduction to a novella anthology titled &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot;, Robert Silverberg writes:

In his essay, &quot;Briefly, the case for the novella&quot;, Canadian author George Fetherling (who wrote the novella &quot;Tales of Two Cities&quot;) said that to reduce the novella to nothing more than a short novel is like &quot;insisting that a pony is a baby horse&quot;.

The sometimes blurry definition between a novel and a novella can create controversy, as was the case with British writer Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot; (2007). The author described it as a novella, but the panel for the Man Booker Prize in 2007 qualified the book as a &quot;short novel&quot;. Thus, this &quot;novella&quot; was shortlisted for an award for best original novel. A similar case is found with a much older work of fiction: &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (1903) by Jack London. This book, by modern standards, is short enough and straightforward enough to qualify as a novella. However, historically, it has been regarded as a novel.

=== Versus novelette===
Dictionaries define &quot;novelette&quot; similarly to &quot;novella&quot;, sometimes identically, sometimes with a disparaging sense of being trivial or sentimental. Some literary awards have a longer &quot;novella&quot; and a shorter &quot;novelette&quot; category, with a distinction based on word count. Among awards, a range between 17,500 and 40,000 words is commonly used for the novella category, whereas 7,500–17,500 is commonly used for novelettes. According to &quot;The Writer&quot;, a novelette is approximately between 7,000 and 20,000 words in length, anything shorter being considered a short story.

==Notable examples==

This list contains those novellas that are widely considered to be the best examples of the genre, through their appearance on multiple best-of lists.

==Word counts==
Some literary awards include a &quot;best novella&quot; award and sometimes a separate &quot;best novelette&quot; award, separately from &quot;best short story&quot; or &quot;best novel&quot;. The distinction between these categories may be entirely by word count.

<text>In Greek mythology, Icarus (; , ) was the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the architect of the labyrinth of Crete. After Theseus, king of Athens and enemy of King Minos, escaped from the labyrinth, Minos suspected that Icarus and Daedalus had revealed the labyrinth&#x27;s secrets and imprisoned them—either in a large tower overlooking the ocean or in the labyrinth itself, depending upon the account. Icarus and Daedalus escaped using wings Daedalus constructed from birds’ molted feathers, threads from blankets, the leather straps from their sandals, and beeswax. Before escaping, Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too low or the water would soak the feathers and not to fly too close to the sun or the heat would melt the wax. Icarus ignored Daedalus&#x27;s instructions not to fly too close to the sun, causing the beeswax in his wings to melt. Icarus fell from the sky, plunged into the sea, and drowned. The myth gave rise to the idiom, &quot;.&quot; In some versions of the tale, Daedalus and Icarus escape by ship.

== The legend ==

Icarus&#x27;s father Daedalus, a very talented Athenian craftsman, built a labyrinth for King Minos of Crete near his palace at Knossos to imprison the Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull monster born of his wife and the Cretan bull. Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he believed Daedalus gave Minos&#x27;s daughter, Ariadne, a (or ball of string) in order to help Theseus escape the labyrinth and defeat the Minotaur.

Daedalus fashioned two pairs of wings for himself and his son, made of metal feathers held to a leather frame by beeswax. Before trying to escape the island, he warned his son to follow his flight path and not fly too close to the sun or the sea. Overcome by giddiness while flying, Icarus disobeyed his father and soared higher into the sky. Without warning, the heat from the sun softened (and melted) the wax. Icarus could feel melted wax dripping down his arms. The feathers then fell one by one. Icarus kept flapping his &quot;wings&quot;, trying to stay aloft. But he realized that he had no feathers left. He was only flapping his bare arms. He also saw loose feathers falling like snowflakes. Finally, he fell into the sea, sank to the bottom, and drowned. Daedalus wept for his son and called the nearest land Icaria (an island southwest of Samos) in the memory of him.

Today, the supposed site of his burial on the island bears his name, and the sea near Icaria in which he drowned is called the Icarian Sea. With much grief, Daedalus went to the temple of Apollo in Sicily, hung up his own wings as an offering, and promised to never attempt to fly again. According to scholia on Euripides, Icarus thought himself greater than Helios, the Sun himself, and the god punished him by directing his powerful rays at him, melting the beeswax. Afterwards, it was Helios who named the Icarian Sea after Icarus.

Hellenistic writers give euhemerising variants in which the escape from Crete was actually by boat, provided by Pasiphaë, for which Daedalus invented the first sails, to outstrip Minos&#x27;s pursuing galleys, that Icarus fell overboard en route to Sicily and drowned, and that Heracles erected a tomb for him.

== Classical literature ==

Accounts of Icarus&#x27;s story are found in Pseudo-Apollodorus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (Epitome i.12–13); Diodorus Siculus&#x27;s &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; (4.77.5–9); Hyginus&#x27;s &quot;Fabulae&quot; (40); Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (vi.14–33); and Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (viii.183–235). A number of other ancient writers allude to the story in passing, notably Lucian.

The account by Pseudo-Apollodorus is brief. Ovid&#x27;s account in the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is among the lengthiest, and the Latin poet refers to Icarus&#x27;s myth elsewhere. Hyginus, among the Augustan writers who wrote about it in Latin in his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, tells of the bovine love affair of Pasiphaë, daughter of the Sun, that resulted in the birth of the Minotaur.

== Medieval, Renaissance, and modern literature ==
Ovid&#x27;s version of the Icarus myth and its connection to Phaethon influenced the mythological tradition in English literature reflected in the writings of Chaucer, Marlowe, Shakespeare, Milton, and Joyce.

In Renaissance iconography, the significance of Icarus depends on context: in the Orion Fountain at Messina, he is one of many figures associated with water; but he is also shown on the Bankruptcy Court of the Amsterdam Town Hall – where he symbolizes high-flying ambition. The 16th-century painting &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot;,) attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Elder, was the inspiration for two of the 20th century&#x27;s most notable ekphrastic English-language poems, &quot;Musée des Beaux Arts&quot; by W. H. Auden and &quot;Landscape with the Fall of Icarus&quot; by William Carlos Williams. Other English-language poems referring to the Icarus myth are &quot;To a Friend Whose Work Has Come to Triumph&quot; by Anne Sexton; &quot;Icarus&quot; by John Updike; &quot;Icarus Again&quot; by Alan Devenish; &quot;Mrs Icarus&quot; by Carol Ann Duffy; &quot;Failing and Flying&quot; by Jack Gilbert; &quot;It Should Have Been Winter&quot; by Nancy Chen Long, &quot;Up like Icarus&quot; by Mark Antony Owen, &quot;Age 10, 3am&quot; by Sheri Wright, and &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Myth&quot; by Jennifer Chang. While the myth is a major subtext throughout Hiromi Yoshida&#x27;s full-length poetry book &quot;Green Roses Bloom for Icarus&quot; (2024), Icarus is a metaphor for troubled modern young men in the Norwegian Axel Jensen&#x27;s novel &quot;Icarus: A Young Man in Sahara&quot; (1957). He is also the subject of the 2017 novel, &quot;Icarus&quot;, by Adam Wing. According to the New York Times Book Review, the hero of Andrew Boryga’s “Victim” is an “inner-city Icarus” who exaggerates his victimization narrative until it implodes.

== Interpretation ==
Literary interpretation has considered the myth of Icarus as a consequence of excessive ambition. An Icarus-related study of the Daedalus myth was published by the French hellenist Françoise Frontisi-Ducroux. In psychology, there have been synthetic studies of the &quot;Icarus complex&quot; with respect to the alleged relationship between fascination for fire, enuresis, high ambition, and Ascensionism. In the psychiatric mind, features of disease were perceived in the shape of the pendulous emotional ecstatic-&quot;high&quot; and depressive-&quot;low&quot; of bipolar disorder. Henry Murray having proposed the term &quot;Icarus complex&quot;, apparently found symptoms particularly in mania where a person is fond of heights, fascinated by both fire and water, &quot;narcissistic&quot; and observed with fantastical or &quot;far-fetched imaginary&quot; cognition. Seth Godin&#x27;s 2012 &quot;The Icarus Deception,&quot; points to the historical change in how Western culture both propagated and interpreted the Icarus myth arguing that &quot;We tend to forget that Icarus was also warned not to fly too low, because seawater would ruin the lift in his wings. Flying too low is even more dangerous than flying too high, because it feels deceptively safe.&quot; Each study and analysis of the myth agrees Icarus was too ambitious for his own good.

<doc id="82728" wikidata="Q830791" url="?curid=82728" title="Quantum superposition">
<text>Quantum superposition is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that states that linear combinations of solutions to the Schrödinger equation are also solutions of the Schrödinger equation. This follows from the fact that the Schrödinger equation is a linear differential equation in time and position. More precisely, the state of a system is given by a linear combination of all the eigenfunctions of the Schrödinger equation governing that system.

An example is a qubit used in quantum information processing. A qubit state is most generally a superposition of the basis states formula_1 and formula_2:

: formula_3

where formula_4 is the quantum state of the qubit, and formula_1, formula_2 denote particular solutions to the Schrödinger equation in Dirac notation weighted by the two probability amplitudes formula_7 and formula_8 that both are complex numbers. Here formula_9 corresponds to the classical 0 bit, and formula_10 to the classical 1 bit. The probabilities of measuring the system in the formula_1 or formula_2 state are given by formula_13 and formula_14 respectively (see the Born rule). Before the measurement occurs the qubit is in a superposition of both states.

The interference fringes in the double-slit experiment provide another example of the superposition principle.

== Wave postulate ==
The theory of quantum mechanics postulates that a wave equation completely determines the state of a quantum system at all times. Furthermore, this differential equation is restricted to be linear and homogeneous. These conditions mean that for any two solutions of the wave equation, formula_15 and formula_16, a linear combination of those solutions also solve the wave equation:
formula_17
for arbitrary complex coefficients formula_8 and formula_19. If the wave equation has more than two solutions, combinations of all such solutions are again valid solutions.

== Transformation ==
The quantum wave equation can be solved using functions of position, formula_20, or using functions of momentum, formula_21 and consequently the superposition of momentum functions are also solutions:
formula_22
The position and momentum solutions are related by a linear transformation, a Fourier transformation. This transformation is itself a quantum superposition and every position wave function can be represented as a superposition of momentum wave functions and vice versa. These superpositions involve an infinite number of component waves. 

== Generalization to basis states ==
Other transformations express a quantum solution as a superposition of eigenvectors, each corresponding to a possible result of a measurement on the quantum system. An eigenvector formula_23 for a mathematical operator, formula_24, has the equation
formula_25
where formula_26 is one possible measured quantum value for the observable formula_27. A superposition of these eigenvectors can represent any solution:
formula_28
The states like formula_23 are called basis states. 

== Compact notation for superpositions ==
Important mathematical operations on quantum system solutions can be performed using only the coefficients of the superposition, suppressing the details of the superposed functions. This leads to quantum systems expressed in the Dirac bra-ket notation:
formula_30
This approach is especially effect for systems like quantum spin with no classical coordinate analog. Such shorthand notation is very common in textbooks and papers on quantum mechanics and superposition of basis states is a fundamental tool in quantum mechanics.

==Consequences==
Paul Dirac described the superposition principle as follows:
The non-classical nature of the superposition process is brought out clearly if we consider the superposition of two states, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, such that there exists an observation which, when made on the system in state &quot;A&quot;, is certain to lead to one particular result, &quot;a&quot; say, and when made on the system in state &quot;B&quot; is certain to lead to some different result, &quot;b&quot; say. What will be the result of the observation when made on the system in the superposed state? The answer is that the result will be sometimes &quot;a&quot; and sometimes &quot;b&quot;, according to a probability law depending on the relative weights of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the superposition process. It will never be different from both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; [i.e., either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot;]. &quot;The intermediate character of the state formed by superposition thus expresses itself through the probability of a particular result for an observation being intermediate between the corresponding probabilities for the original states, not through the result itself being intermediate between the corresponding results for the original states.&quot;

Anton Zeilinger, referring to the prototypical example of the double-slit experiment, has elaborated regarding the creation and destruction of quantum superposition:

&quot;[T]he superposition of amplitudes ... is only valid if there is no way to know, even in principle, which path the particle took. It is important to realize that this does not imply that an observer actually takes note of what happens. It is sufficient to destroy the interference pattern, if the path information is accessible in principle from the experiment or even if it is dispersed in the environment and beyond any technical possibility to be recovered, but in principle still ‘‘out there.’’ The absence of any such information is &quot;the essential criterion&quot; for quantum interference to appear.

==Theory==

=== General formalism ===
Any quantum state can be expanded as a sum or superposition of the eigenstates of an Hermitian operator, like the Hamiltonian, because the eigenstates form a complete basis:
:formula_31

where formula_32 are the energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. For continuous variables like position eigenstates, formula_33:

:formula_34

where formula_35 is the projection of the state into the formula_33 basis and is called the wave function of the particle. In both instances we notice that formula_37 can be expanded as a superposition of an infinite number of basis states.

===Example===
Given the Schrödinger equation

: formula_38

where formula_32 indexes the set of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with energy eigenvalues formula_40 we see immediately that

: formula_41

where

: formula_42

is a solution of the Schrödinger equation but is not generally an eigenstate because formula_43 and formula_44 are not generally equal. We say that formula_45 is made up of a superposition of energy eigenstates. Now consider the more concrete case of an electron that has either spin up or down. We now index the eigenstates with the spinors in the formula_46 basis:

: formula_47

where formula_48 and formula_49 denote spin-up and spin-down states respectively. As previously discussed, the magnitudes of the complex coefficients give the probability of finding the electron in either definite spin state:

: formula_50
: formula_51
: formula_52

where the probability of finding the particle with either spin up or down is normalized to 1. Notice that formula_8 and formula_19 are complex numbers, so that

: formula_55

is an example of an allowed state. We now get

: formula_56
: formula_57
: formula_58

If we consider a qubit with both position and spin, the state is a superposition of all possibilities for both:

:formula_59

where we have a general state formula_60 is the sum of the tensor products of the position space wave functions and spinors.

==Experiments ==

Successful experiments involving superpositions of relatively large (by the standards of quantum physics) objects have been performed.
* A beryllium ion has been trapped in a superposed state.
* A double slit experiment has been performed with molecules as large as buckyballs and functionalized oligoporphyrins with up to 2000 atoms.
* Molecules with masses exceeding 10,000 and composed of over 810 atoms have successfully been superposed
* Very sensitive magnetometers have been realized using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDS) that operate using quantum interference effects in superconducting circuits.

* A piezoelectric &quot;tuning fork&quot; has been constructed, which can be placed into a superposition of vibrating and non-vibrating states. The resonator comprises about 10 trillion atoms.
* Recent research indicates that chlorophyll within plants appears to exploit the feature of quantum superposition to achieve greater efficiency in transporting energy, allowing pigment proteins to be spaced further apart than would otherwise be possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi:10.1038/nature08811&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== In quantum computers ==
In quantum computers, a qubit is the analog of the classical information bit and qubits can be superposed. Unlike classical bits, a superposition of qubits represents information about two states in parallel. Controlling the superposition of qubits is a central challenge in quantum computation. Qubit systems like nuclear spins with small coupling strength are robust to outside disturbances but the same small coupling makes it difficult to readout results.

<text>The US Open Tennis Championships, commonly called the US Open, is a hardcourt tennis tournament organized by the United States Tennis Association annually in Queens, New York City. It is chronologically the fourth and final of the four Grand Slam tennis events, held after the Australian Open, French Open, and Wimbledon.

The US Open starts on the last Monday of August and continues for two weeks, with the middle weekend coinciding with the United States Labor Day holiday. All players participating must be at least fourteen years old.

The tournament is one of the oldest tennis championships in the world, originally known as the U.S. National Championships, for which men&#x27;s singles and men&#x27;s doubles were first played in August 1881. It is the only Grand Slam that was not affected by cancellation due to World War I and World War II, nor interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

The tournament consists of five primary championships: men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s doubles, and mixed doubles. The tournament also includes events for senior, junior, and wheelchair players. Since 1978, the tournament has been played on acrylic hardcourts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, Queens, New York City. Revenue from ticket sales, sponsorships, and television contracts is used to develop tennis in the United States.

This tournament, from 1971 to 2021, employed standard tiebreakers (first to seven points, win by two) in every set of a singles match. Since 2022, revised tiebreak rules were initiated and standardized in the final set for all four majors, where if a match reaches six-all in the final set (the third for women and fifth for men), an extended tiebreaker (first to ten points, win by two) is played. The introduction of the extended tiebreaker in 2022 was part of a broader effort to standardize play across the Grand Slam tournaments, ensuring consistency in how matches are decided while also addressing player fatigue and match duration.

==History==

===1881–1914: Newport Casino===
&lt;section begin=&quot;GrandSlamArticle&quot; /&gt;
The tournament was first held in August 1881 on grass courts at the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island, which is now home to the International Tennis Hall of Fame. That year, only clubs that were members of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) were permitted to enter. Richard Sears won the men&#x27;s singles at this tournament, which was the first of his seven consecutive singles titles. From 1884 through 1911, the tournament used a challenge system whereby the defending champion automatically qualified for the next year&#x27;s final, where he would play the winner of the all-comers tournament.

Only men competed in the U.S. National Championships from 1881 to 1886. It had both a singles and doubles division. The first U.S. Women&#x27;s National Singles Championship was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in 1887. The winner was 17-year-old Philadelphian Ellen Hansell. In that same year, the men&#x27;s doubles event was played at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, New Jersey.

The women&#x27;s tournament used a challenge system from 1888 through 1918, except in 1917. Between 1890 and 1906, sectional tournaments were held in the east and the west of the country to determine the best two doubles teams, which competed in a play-off for the right to compete against the defending champions in the challenge round.&lt;section end=&quot;GrandSlamArticle&quot; /&gt;

The 1888 and the 1889 men&#x27;s doubles events were played at the Staten Island Cricket Club in Livingston, Staten Island, New York. In the 1893 Championships, the men&#x27;s doubles event was played at the St. George Cricket Club in Chicago. In 1892, the US Mixed Doubles Championship was introduced and, in 1899, the US Women&#x27;s National Doubles Championship.

In 1915, the national championships was relocated to the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City. The effort to relocate it to New York City began as early as 1911 when a group of tennis players, headed by New Yorker Karl Behr, started working on it.

===1915–1977: West Side Tennis Club===
In early 1915, a group of about 100 tennis players signed a petition in favor of moving the tournament. They argued that most tennis clubs, players, and fans were located in the New York City area and that it would therefore be beneficial for the development of the sport to host the national championships there. This view was opposed by another group of players that included eight former national singles champions. This contentious issue was brought to a vote at the annual USNLTA meeting on February 5, 1915, with 128 votes in favor of and 119 against relocation. In August 1915, the men&#x27;s singles tournament was held at the West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills in New York City for the first time, while the women&#x27;s tournament was held at the Philadelphia Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia (the women&#x27;s singles event was not moved until 1921). From 1917 to 1933, the men&#x27;s doubles event was held at the Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. In 1934, both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s doubles events were held at Longwood Cricket Club.

From 1921 through 1923, the men&#x27;s singles tournament was played at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia. It returned to the West Side Tennis Club in 1924 following the completion of the 14,000-seat Forest Hills Stadium.&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Although many already regarded it as a major championship, the International Lawn Tennis Federation did not officially designate it as one of the world&#x27;s major tournaments until 1924. At the 1922 U.S. National Championships, the draw seeded players for the first time to prevent the leading players from playing each other in the early rounds. From 1935 to 1941 and 1946 to 1967, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s doubles were held at the Longwood Cricket Club.

===Open Era===
The Open Era began in 1968 when professional tennis players were allowed to compete for the first time at the Grand Slam tournament held at the West Side Tennis Club. The previous U.S. National Championships had been limited to amateur players. Except for mixed doubles, all events at the 1968 national tournament were open to professionals. That year, 96 men and 63 women entered, and prize money totaled $100,000. In 1970, the US Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to use a tiebreaker to decide a set that reached a 6–6 score in games. From 1970 through 1974, the US Open used a best-of-nine-point sudden-death tiebreaker before moving to the International Tennis Federation&#x27;s (ITF) best-of-twelve points system. In 1973, the US Open became the first Grand Slam tournament to award equal prize money to men and women, with that year&#x27;s singles champions, John Newcombe and Margaret Court, receiving $25,000 each. Since 1975, following complaints about the surface and its impact on the ball&#x27;s bounce, the tournament has been played on clay courts instead of grass. This was also an experiment to make it more &quot;TV friendly&quot;. The addition of floodlights allowed matches to be played at night.

===Since 1978: USTA National Tennis Center===

In 1978, the tournament moved from the West Side Tennis Club to the larger and newly constructed USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, to the north. The tournament&#x27;s court surface also switched from clay to hardcourt. Jimmy Connors is the only individual to have won US Open singles titles on all three surfaces (grass, clay, and hardcourt), while Chris Evert is the only woman to have won US Open singles titles on two surfaces (clay and hardcourt).

The US Open is the only Grand Slam tournament that has been played every year since its inception.

In 2005 the US Open added Wheelchair singles and Wheelchair doubles tournament, while in 2006 the US Open added the Quad singles and Quad doubles tournament. During the 2006 US Open, the complex was renamed to &quot;USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center&quot; in honor of Billie Jean King, a four-time US Open singles champion and one of women&#x27;s tennis&#x27;s early pioneers.

With the move to Flushing, the women&#x27;s final was played between the two men&#x27;s semi-finals on Saturday, creating a block that came to be known as &quot;Super Saturday&quot;. While fan-friendly, the concept proved divisive among players because it gave them less than a day&#x27;s rest between the semifinal and championship matches. A number of spectators also tended to leave after the women&#x27;s final, and not stay for the second men&#x27;s semifinal.

This ended in 2001, when the women&#x27;s final was moved to prime time to encourage television viewership, citing a major growth in popularity for women&#x27;s tennis among viewers. This practice was eventually discontinued, and the women&#x27;s final is currently played in the late afternoon.

For five consecutive tournaments between 2008 through 2012, the men&#x27;s final was postponed to Monday due to weather. In 2013 and 2014, the USTA intentionally scheduled the men&#x27;s final on a Monday—a move praised for allowing the men&#x27;s players an extra day&#x27;s rest following the semifinals, but drew the ire of the ATP for further deviating from the structure of the other Grand Slams. 

In 2015, the US Open returned to a format similar to the other Grand Slams, with women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s finals on Saturday and Sunday, and players having an extra day of rest. However, weather delays forced both sets of semifinals to be held on Friday of that year.

In 2018, the tournament was the first Grand Slam tournament that introduced the shot clock to keep a check on the time consumed by players between points. The reason for this change was to increase the pace of play. The clock is placed in a position visible to players, the chair umpire and fans. Since 2020, all Grand Slams, ATP, and WTA tournaments apply this technology.

In 2019, the tournament marked the last time that five-time champion Roger Federer participated. Rafael Nadal won men&#x27;s singles defeating Daniil Medvedev.

In 2020, the event was held without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the Western &amp; Southern Open was also re-located from Cincinnati in order to create a bio-secure bubble for both events due to their proximity. An announcement that the wheelchair tennis competition would not be held caused controversy, because the USTA did not consult with athletes prior to it, as it had with the players&#x27; organizations for the able-bodied competitions. After accusations of discrimination, the USTA was forced to backtrack, admitting that it should have discussed the decision with the wheelchair competitors and offering them either $150,000 to be split between them (compared with $3.3m to be split between the players affected by the cancellation of each of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s qualifying competition and reductions in the mixed-doubles pool), a competition as part of the Open with 95% of the 2019 prize fund, or a competition to be held at the USTA base in Florida.

==Grounds==

The grounds of the US Open have 22 outdoor courts (plus 12 practice courts just outside the East Gate) consisting of four &quot;show courts&quot; (Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium, the Grandstand, and Court 17), 13 field courts, and 5 practice courts.

The main court is the 23,771-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium, which opened in 1997. A US$180 million retractable roof was added in 2016. The stadium is named after Arthur Ashe, who won the men&#x27;s singles title at the inaugural US Open in 1968, and was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1985. The next largest court is the 14,061-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium, which cost US$200 million to build and opened in 2018. The 6,400-seat lower tier of this stadium is separately ticketed, reserved seating while the 7,661-seat upper tier is general admission and not separately ticketed. The third largest court is the 8,125-seat Grandstand in the southwest corner of the grounds, which opened in 2016. Court 17 in the southeast corner of the grounds is the fourth largest stadium. It opened with temporary seating in 2011 and received its permanent seating the following year. It has a seating capacity of 2,800, all of which is general admission and not separately ticketed. It is nicknamed &quot;The Pit&quot;, partly because the playing surface is sunk 8 feet into the ground. The total seating capacity for practice courts P1-P5 is 672 and for competition Courts 4–16 is 12,656, itemized as follows:

* Courts 11 &amp; 12: 1,704 each
* Court 7: 1,494
* Court 5: 1,148
* Courts 10 &amp; 13: 1,104 each
* Court 4: 1,066
* Court 6: 1,032
* Court 9: 624
* Courts 14 &amp; 15: 502 each
* Courts 8 &amp; 16: 336 each

All the courts used by the US Open are illuminated, allowing matches and television coverage to extend into the evening. 

===Surface===
From 1978 to 2019, the US Open was played on a hardcourt surface called Pro DecoTurf. It is a multi-layer cushioned surface and classified by the International Tennis Federation as medium-fast. Each August before the start of the tournament, the courts are resurfaced. In March 2020, the USTA announced that Laykold would become the new court surface supplier beginning with the 2020 tournament.

Since 2005, all US Open and US Open Series tennis courts have been painted a shade of blue (trademarked as &quot;US Open Blue&quot;) inside the lines to make it easier for players, spectators, and television viewers to see the ball. The area outside the lines is still painted &quot;US Open Green&quot;.

===Player line call challenges===
In 2006, the US Open introduced instant replay reviews of line calls, using the Hawk-Eye computer system. It was the first Grand Slam tournament to use the system. The Open felt the need to implement the system because of the controversial quarterfinal match at the 2004 US Open between Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati, where a number of important line calls went against Williams. Replays on TV showed these calls were incorrect, including one critical point in the match that was incorrectly overruled by the chair umpire. Instant replay was available only on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts through the 2008 tournament. In 2009, it became available on the Grandstand court. In 2018, all competition courts were outfitted with Hawk-Eye, and all matches in the main draws (Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Singles and Doubles) followed the same procedure, whereby each player was allowed three incorrect challenges per set, with one more given in a tiebreak. Player challenges were eliminated in 2021, when the tournament became the second Grand Slam to fully incorporate Hawk-Eye Live, where all line calls are made electronically; the previous year&#x27;s tournament had also incorporated Hawk-Eye Live on all courts except for Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong stadiums to reduce personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2007, JPMorgan Chase renewed its sponsorship of the US Open and, as part of the arrangement, the replay system was renamed to &quot;Chase Review&quot; on in-stadium video and television.

==Point and prize money distribution==

=== Prize money ===

The total prize money for the 2023 US Open was $65 million and is the largest package of all Grand Slams and the largest in tournament history. The package is divided as follows:

The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s singles prize money ($44.7 million) accounts for 68.7 percent of total player base compensation, while men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s doubles ($7,133,600), men&#x27;s and mixed doubles ($679,200) account for 11.0 percent and 1.0 percent, respectively. All prize money for the doubles competitions are distributed per team. The prize money for the wheelchair draw amounts to a total of $1,366,800, plus additional expenses, such as per diem and direct hotel payments of $4,656,420.

In 2012, the USTA agreed to increase the US Open prize money to $50.4 million by 2017. As a result, the prize money for the 2013 tournament was $33.6 million, a record $8.1 million increase from 2012. The champions of the 2013 US Open Series also had the opportunity to add $2.6 million in bonus prize money, potentially bringing the total 2013 US Open purse to more than $36 million. In 2014, the prize money was $38.3 million. In 2015, the prize money was increased to $42.3 million. In 2021, the USTA set a new record for the highest prize money and total player compensation in the tournament&#x27;s history with $57,462,000 and also boosted the prize money for the qualifying tournament to $6 million, a 66% increase over the package in 2019.

The 2023 tournament saw another record, with total prize money reaching $65 million. Efforts were also undertaken to enhance support for participants across all events by implementing expanded player expense assistance measures. This iteration of the tournament introduced substantial changes in player per diem allowances, extending to all competitors. Notably, travel vouchers worth $1,000 have been newly introduced. Moreover, players can receive an additional hotel room or witness a twofold increase in their daily hotel allowance, which has been raised from $300 to $600, provided they choose alternate lodging. Additionally, an elevation in meal allowances and provision of racquet stringing services are also in effect for all participating players.

<text>Puigcerdà (; , ) is the capital of the &quot;Catalan comarca&quot; of Cerdanya, in the province of Girona, Catalonia, northern Spain, near the Segre River and on the border with France (it abuts directly onto the French town of Bourg-Madame).

== History ==
Puigcerdà is located near the site of a Ceretani settlement, which was incorporated into Roman territory. The Roman town was named Julia Libyca (modern day Llívia).

Puigcerdà was founded in 1178 by King Alfonso I of Aragon, Count of Barcelona. In 1178 Puigcerdà replaced Hix as the capital of Cerdanya. Hix is now a village in the commune of Bourg-Madame, in the French part of Cerdanya.

In the closing stages of the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War, the town was captured by a French army under the duc de Noailles but returned to Spain in the Treaties of Nijmegen. 

Puigcerdà was unique during the Spanish Civil War in having a democratically elected Anarchist council.

The Portet-Saint-Simon–Puigcerdà railway was opened in 1929, crossing the Pyrenees to France.

<text>Gandesa () is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Terra Alta, in the province of Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain.

==History==
In the place known as &quot;Coll del Moro&quot; there is an ancient Iberian archaeological site belonging to the Ilercavones tribe that lived in this area before Roman times.

Gandesa has a church with unusual and interesting sculptures on the Romanesque porch.

The old winery of Gandesa, also known in Catalonia as one of the Wine Cathedrals, is from Modernisme and Noucentisme style and was designed by the architect Cèsar Martinell in 1919.

Gandesa was at the center of fighting during the Battle of the Ebro (Battle of Gandesa and Siege of Gandesa) in the Spanish Civil War. In the summer of 1938, Republican forces crossed the Ebro in an attempt to throw back the Nationalist armies of General Franco. This is mentioned in the ballad &quot;Jamie Foyers&quot; and &quot;Si me quieres escribir&quot;, also known as &quot;El Frente de Gandesa&quot;. Now there is a museum devoted to the Battle of the Ebro in Gandesa.

On 23 December 1948 an Iberia Airlines Douglas DC-3 crashed in bad weather near Gandesa killing all 27 occupants.

<text>Balaguer () is the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Noguera, in the province of Lleida, Catalonia, Spain. It is located by the river Segre, a tributary to the Ebro. The municipality includes an exclave to the east. Balaguer also has a sister city in the western United States, Pacifica, California.

Balaguer was conquered from the Moors by Ermengol VI of Urgell in 1106; he made it his new capital, and it remained so for subsequent counts of Urgell.

A Jewish community existed in Balaguer from the 11th century to the expulsion of the Jews in 1492.

The town has a Gothic bridge, the &quot;Pont de Sant Miquel&quot;, over the Segre river. This bridge was destroyed during the Spanish Civil War in the battle of &quot;Cap de Pont&quot; (bridgehead battle in 1938) and rebuilt after the war.

Another Gothic building is the Santa Maria Church, in the heights above the city, in line with a quite finely conserved wall dating to the 15th century AD.

The historic mansion Palauet de la muralla de Balaguer, converted to a hotel, is located in the city center and part of the old city wall forms the back of the building.

The historic town is on the right bank of the Segre but, following the Spanish Civil War, construction began on a modern bridge, which initiated development of a modern extension of the town on the left bank.

General Franco&#x27;s forces first entered Catalonia from Aragon in 1938 through Balaguer&#x27;s bridgehead.

<text>Tremp () is a municipality in Catalonia, Spain, the capital of the &quot;comarca&quot; of the Pallars Jussà. It is the largest municipality in Catalonia in terms of area (), accounting for nearly a quarter of the total area of the &quot;comarca&quot;.

The municipality is a geographical oddity and consists of five separate territorial entities within the &quot;comarca&quot; (district) of Pallars Jussa (see image). The town of Tremp (population 5.961 as of 2023) is the second smallest of these and is situated in the valley of the Noguera Pallaresa river below Talarn and the Talarn Dam. The largest portion of the municipal territory lies to the west of the valley of the Noguera Pallaresa and stretches as far as the Noguera Ribagorçana river. A third portion is an exclave of the &quot;comarca&quot; within the municipality of el Pont de Suert in the Alta Ribagorça. In the east the villages of Palau de Noguera, Suterranya and Vilamitjana form the fourth entity, while the fifth and smallest portion (of only 1,59 km2) is formed by the village of Puigcercós, south of Tremp.

The town is served by the C-13 road which runs along the valley of the Noguera Pallaresa.

<text>The Xerox Star workstation, officially named Xerox Star 8010 Information System, is the first commercial personal computer to incorporate technologies that have since become standard in personal computers, including a bitmapped display, a window-based graphical user interface, icons, folders, mouse (two-button), Ethernet networking, file servers, print servers, and email.

Introduced by Xerox Corporation on April 27, 1981, the name &quot;Star&quot; technically refers only to the software sold with the system for the office automation market. The 8010 workstations were also sold with software based on the programming languages Lisp and Smalltalk for the smaller research and software development market.

==History==
===The Xerox Alto===

The Xerox Star system&#x27;s concept owes much to the Xerox Alto, an experimental workstation designed by the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The first Alto became operational in 1972. The Alto had been strongly influenced by what its designers had seen previously with the NLS computer system at the Stanford Research Institute and PLATO at University of Illinois. At first, only a few Altos had been built. Although by 1979 nearly 1,000 Ethernet-linked Altos had been put into operation at Xerox and another 500 at collaborating universities and government offices, it was never intended to be a commercial product. Then in 1977, Xerox started a development project which worked to incorporate the Alto innovations into a commercial product; their concept was an integrated document preparation system, centered on the expensive laser printing technology and targeted at large corporations and their trading partners. When the resulting Star system was announced in 1981, the cost was about for a basic system, and for each added workstation. A base system includes an 8010 Star workstation, and an 8010 dedicated as a server (with RS232 I/O), and a floor-standing laser printer. The server software includes a File Server, a Print Server, and distributed services (Mail Server, Clearinghouse Name Server / Directory, and Authentication Server). Xerox Memorywriter typewriters connect to this system over Ethernet and send email, using the Memorywriter as a teletype.

===The Star development process===
The Star was developed at Xerox&#x27;s Systems Development Department (SDD) in El Segundo, California, which had been established in 1977 under the direction of Don Massaro. SDD North was located in Palo Alto, California, including some people borrowed from PARC. SDD&#x27;s mission was to design the &quot;Office of the future&quot;, a new system to incorporate the best features of the Alto, have ease of use, and to automate many office tasks.

The development team was headed by David Liddle, and grew to more than 200 developers. Much of the first year was taken up by meetings and planning, resulting in an extensive and detailed functional specification, internally termed the &quot;Red Book&quot;. This became the bible for all development tasks. It defined the interface and enforced consistency in all modules and tasks. All changes to the functional specification had to be approved by a review team which maintained standards rigorously.

One group in Palo Alto worked on the underlying operating system interface to the hardware and programming tools. Teams in El Segundo and Palo Alto collaborated on developing the user interface and user applications.

The staff relied heavily on the technologies they were working on: file sharing, print servers, and email. They were even connected to the Internet, then named ARPANET, which helped them communicate between El Segundo and Palo Alto.

The Star was implemented in the programming language Mesa, a direct precursor to Modula-2 and Modula-3. Mesa is not object-oriented, but includes processes (threads) and monitors (mutexes) in the language. Mesa requires creating two files for every module: a definition module specified data structures and procedures for each object, and one or more implementation modules contained the code for the procedures. Traits is a programming convention used to implement object-oriented capabilities and multiple inheritance in the customer environment of Star and Viewpoint.

The Star team used a sophisticated integrated development environment (IDE), codenamed Tajo and externally named Xerox Development Environment (XDE). Tajo has many similarities with the Smalltalk-80 environment, but has many added tools, such as the version control system DF, which requires programmers to check out modules before they are changed. Any change in a module which force changes in dependent modules are closely tracked and documented. Changes to lower level modules require various levels of approval.

The software development process was intense. It involved much prototyping and user testing. The software engineers had to develop new network communications protocols and data-encoding schemes when those used in PARC&#x27;s research environment proved inadequate.

Initially, all development was done on Alto workstations. These were not well suited to the extreme burdens placed by the software. Even the processor intended for the product proved inadequate and involved a last minute hardware redesign. Many software redesigns, rewrites, and late additions had to be made, variously based on results from user testing, and marketing and systems considerations.

A Japanese language version of the system was produced in conjunction with Fuji Xerox, code named J-Star, and full support for international customers.

In the end, many features from the Star Functional Specification were not implemented. The product had to get to market, and the last several months before release focused on reliability and performance.

==User interface==

The key philosophy of the user interface is to mimic the office paradigm as much as possible to make it intuitive for users. The concept of &quot;what you see is what you get&quot; (WYSIWYG) was considered paramount. Text is displayed as black on a white background, just like paper, and the printer replicates the screen using Interpress, a page description language developed at PARC.

One of the main designers of the Star, Dr. David Canfield Smith, invented the concept of computer icons and the desktop metaphor, in which the user sees a desktop containing documents and folders, with different icons representing different types of documents. Clicking any icon opens a window. Users do not start programs first (such as a text editor, graphics program, or spreadsheet software), but simply open the file and the appropriate application appears.

The Star user interface is based on the concept of objects. For example, a word processing document holds page objects, paragraph objects, sentence objects, word objects, and character objects. The user selects objects by clicking on them with the mouse, and press dedicated special keys on the keyboard to invoke standard object functions (open, delete, copy, move) in a uniform way. There was also a &quot;Show Properties&quot; key used to display settings, called property sheets, for the particular object (such as font size for a character object). These general conventions greatly simplify the menu structure of all the programs.

Object integration was designed into the system from the start. For example, a chart object created in the graphing module can be inserted into any type of document. Eventually, Apple delivered this ability in the Lisa operating system, and on Macintosh as Publish and Subscribe. It became available on Microsoft Windows with the introduction of Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) in 1990. This approach was later used on the OpenDoc software platform in the late 1990s, and in the AppleWorks (originally ClarisWorks) package for the Macintosh in 1991 and Windows in 1993.

==Hardware==
Initially, the Star software was to run on a new series of virtual-memory processors. The D* (pronounced D-Star) series of machines has names beginning with that letter. They are all microprogrammed processors; for the Star software, microcode is loaded to implement an instruction set designed for Mesa. It was possible to load microcode for the Interlisp or Smalltalk environments, but these three environments can not run at the same time.

The Dolphin (aka D0), built with transistor-transistor logic (TTL) technology, included 74S181 ALUs. It was intended to be the Star workstation, but its cost was deemed too high for the project goals. The complexity of the software eventually overwhelmed its limited configuration. At one time in Star&#x27;s development, it took more than half an hour to reboot the system.

The next generation of these machines, the Dorado (aka D1), used an emitter-coupled logic (ECL) processor. It was four times faster than Dandelion on standard benchmarks, and thus competitive with the fastest super minicomputers of the day. It was used for research but was a rack-mounted CPU that was never intended to be an office product. A network router called Dicentra is based on this design.

The released Star workstation hardware is called Dandelion (often shortened to &quot;Dlion&quot;). It is based on a design from in a PARC technical report, &quot;Wildflower: An Architecture for a Personal Computer&quot;, by Butler Lampson. It is based on the AMD Am2900 bitslice microprocessor technology. An enhanced version of the Dandelion, with more microcode space, was dubbed Dandetiger.

The base Dandelion system has 384 KB memory (expandable to 1.5 MB), a 10 MB, 29 MB or 40 MB 8&quot; hard drive, an 8&quot; floppy drive, mouse, and Ethernet. The performance of this machine, which sold for , is about 850 in the Dhrystone benchmark — comparable to that of a VAX-11/750, which cost five times more. The cathode-ray tube (CRT) display (black and white, 1024×808 pixels with 38.7 Hz refresh) is large for the time. It can display two 8.5×11 in pages side by side in true size. The overscan area (borders) can be programmed with a 16×16 repeating pattern, to extend the root window pattern to all the edges of the monitor.

The D-Star machines were commercialized as:
* Dolphin: Xerox 1100 Scientific Information Processor Lisp machine, (1979)
* Dorado: Xerox 1132 Lisp machine
* Dandelion: Star, Xerox 1108 Lisp machine (1981)
* Dandetiger: Xerox 1109 Lisp machine
* Daybreak: Xerox 6085 Star successor, Xerox 1186 Lisp machine (1985)

==Marketing and commercial reception==
The Xerox Star was not originally meant to be a stand-alone computer, but to be part of an integrated Xerox &quot;personal office system&quot; that also connected to other workstations and network services via Ethernet. Although a single unit sold for , a typical office would need to buy at least 2 or 3 machines along with a file server and a name server/print server. Spending for a complete installation was not an easy sale, when a secretary&#x27;s annual salary was about and a VIC-20 cost around .

Later incarnations of the Star allow users to buy one unit with a laser printer, but only about 25,000 units were sold, leading many to consider it a commercial failure.

The workstation was originally designed to run the Star software for performing office tasks, but it was also sold with different software for other markets. These other configurations included a workstation for Interlisp or Smalltalk, and a server.

Some have said that the Star was ahead of its time, that few outside of a small circle of developers really understood the potential of the system, considering that IBM introduced its 8088-based IBM PC running the comparatively primitive PC DOS the same year as the Star. However, comparison with the IBM PC may be irrelevant: well before it was introduced, buyers in the word processing industry were aware of the 8086-based IBM Displaywriter, the full-page portrait black-on-white Xerox 860 page display system and the 120 page-per-minute Xerox 9700 laser printer. Furthermore, the design principles of Smalltalk and modeless working had been extensively discussed in the August 1981 issue of &quot;Byte&quot; magazine, so Xerox PARC&#x27;s standing and the potential of the Star can scarcely have been lost on its target (office systems) market, who would never have expected IBM to position a mass-market PC to threaten far more profitable dedicated WP systems. Unfortunately, the influential niche market of pioneering players in electronic publishing such as Longman were already aligning their production processes towards generic markup languages such as SGML (forerunner of HTML and XML) whereby authors using inexpensive offline systems could describe document structure, making their manuscripts ready for transfer to computer to film systems that offered far higher resolution than the then maximum of 360 dpi laser printing technologies.

Another possible reason given for the lack of success of the Star was Xerox&#x27;s corporate structure. A longtime copier company, Xerox played to their strengths. They already had one significant failure in making their acquisition of Scientific Data Systems pay off. It is said that there were internal jealousies between the old line copier systems divisions that were responsible for bulk of Xerox&#x27;s revenues and the new upstart division. Their marketing efforts were seen by some as half-hearted or unfocused. Furthermore, the most technically savvy sales representatives that might have sold office automation equipment were paid large commissions on leases of laser printer equipment costing up to a half-million dollars. No commission structure for &quot;decentralized&quot; systems could compete. The multi-lingual technical documentation market was also a major opportunity, but this needed cross-border collaboration for which few sales organisations were ready at the time.

Even within Xerox Corporation, in the mid-1980s, there was little understanding of the system. Few corporate executives ever saw or used the system, and the sales teams, if they requested a &quot;computer&quot; to assist with their planning, would instead receive older, CP/M-based Xerox 820 or 820-II systems. There was no effort to seed the 8010/8012 Star systems within Xerox Corporation.

Probably most significantly, strategic planners at the Xerox Systems Group (XSG) felt that they could not compete against other workstation makers such as Apollo Computer or Symbolics. The Xerox name alone was considered their greatest asset, but it did not produce customers.

Finally, by later standards, the system would be considered very slow, due partly to the limited hardware of the time, and partly to a poorly implemented file system; saving a large file could take minutes. Crashes can be followed by an hours-long process called &quot;file scavenging&quot;, signaled by the appearance of the diagnostic code &quot;7511&quot; in the top left corner of the screen.

The successor to the Star, the Xerox 6085 PCS, uses a different, more efficient hardware platform, Daybreak, using a new, faster processor, and accompanied by significant rewriting of the Star software, renamed ViewPoint, to improve performance. The new system was released in 1985. The new hardware provided 1 MB to 4 MB of memory, a 10 MB to 80 MB hard disk, a 15&quot; or 19&quot; display, a 5.25&quot; floppy drive, a mouse, Ethernet connection and a price of a little over .

The Xerox 6085 could be sold along with an attached laser printer as a standalone system. Also offered was a PC compatibility mode via an 80186-based expansion board. Users could transfer files between the ViewPoint system and PC-based software, albeit with some difficulty because the file formats were incompatible with any on the PC. But even with a significantly lower price, it was still a Rolls-Royce in the world of lower cost personal computers.

In 1989, Viewpoint 2.0 introduced many new applications related to desktop publishing. Eventually, Xerox jettisoned the integrated hardware/software workstation offered by Viewpoint and offered a software-only product called &quot;GlobalView&quot;, providing the Star interface and technology on an IBM PC compatible platform. The initial release required installing a Mesa CPU add-on board. The final release of GlobalView 2.1 in 1996 ran as an emulator on Solaris, Microsoft Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Windows 98, and OS/2.

==Legacy==
Even though the Star product failed in the market, it raised expectations and laid important groundwork for later computers. Many of the innovations behind the Star, such as WYSIWYG editing, Ethernet, and network services such as directory, print, file, and internetwork routing have become commonplace in computers.

Members of the Lisa engineering team saw Star at its introduction at the National Computer Conference (NCC &#x27;81) and returned to Cupertino where they converted their desktop manager to an icon-based interface modeled on the Star. Among the developers of Xerox&#x27;s Gypsy WYSIWYG editor, Larry Tesler left Xerox to join Apple in 1980 where he also developed the MacApp framework.

Charles Simonyi left Xerox to join Microsoft in 1981 where he developed first WYSIWYG version of Microsoft Word (3.0). In 1983, Simonyi recommended Scott A. McGregor, who was recruited by Bill Gates to lead the development of Windows 1.0, in part for McGregor&#x27;s experience in windowing systems at PARC. Later that year, several others left PARC to join Microsoft.

Star, Viewpoint, and GlobalView were the first commercial computing environments to offer support for most natural languages, including full-featured word processing, leading to their adoption by the Voice of America, other United States foreign affairs agencies, and several multinational corporations.
The list of products that were inspired or influenced by the user interface of the Star, and to a lesser extent the Alto, include the Lisa, Macintosh, Graphics Environment Manager (GEM), Visi On, Windows, Atari ST, BTRON from TRON Project, Amiga, Elixir Desktop, Metaphor Computer Systems, Interleaf, OS/2, OPEN LOOK (co-developed by Xerox), SunView, KDE, Ventura Publisher, and NEXTSTEP. Adobe Systems PostScript was based on Interpress. Ethernet was further refined by 3Com, and has become a &quot;de facto&quot; standard networking protocol.

Some people said that Apple, Microsoft, and others plagiarized the GUI and other innovations from the Xerox Star, and believe that Xerox didn&#x27;t properly protect its intellectual property. Many patent disclosures were submitted for the innovations in the Star. However, at the time, the 1975 Xerox Consent Decree, a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust action, placed restrictions on what the firm was able to patent. Also, when the Star disclosures were being prepared, the Xerox patent attorneys were busy with several other new technologies such as laser printing. Finally, patents on software, particularly those relating to user interfaces, were then an untested legal area.

Xerox went to trial to protect the Star user interface. In 1989, after &quot;Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp.&quot; for copyright infringement of the Macintosh user interface in Windows, Xerox filed a similar lawsuit against Apple. However, this suit was dismissed on procedural grounds, not substantive, because a three-year statute of limitations had passed. In 1994, Apple lost its suit against Microsoft, not only the issues originally contested, but all claims to the user interface.

On January 15, 2019, a work-in-progress Star emulator created by LCM+L known as Darkstar was released for Windows and Linux.

<text>In mathematics, Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem states that the product of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact with respect to the product topology. The theorem is named after Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov (whose surname sometimes is transcribed &quot;Tychonoff&quot;), who proved it first in 1930 for powers of the closed unit interval and in 1935 stated the full theorem along with the remark that its proof was the same as for the special case. The earliest known published proof is contained in a 1935 article by Tychonoff, .

Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem is often considered as perhaps the single most important result in general topology (along with Urysohn&#x27;s lemma). The theorem is also valid for topological spaces based on fuzzy sets.

== Topological definitions ==

The theorem depends crucially upon the precise definitions of compactness and of the product topology; in fact, Tychonoff&#x27;s 1935 paper defines the product topology for the first time. Conversely, part of its importance is to give confidence that these particular definitions are the most useful (i.e. most well-behaved) ones.

Indeed, the Heine–Borel definition of compactness—that every covering of a space by open sets admits a finite subcovering—is relatively recent. More popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries was the Bolzano-Weierstrass criterion that every bounded infinite sequence admits a convergent subsequence, now called sequential compactness. These conditions are equivalent for metrizable spaces, but neither one implies the other in the class of all topological spaces.

It is almost trivial to prove that the product of two sequentially compact spaces is sequentially compact—one passes to a subsequence for the first component and then a subsubsequence for the second component. An only slightly more elaborate &quot;diagonalization&quot; argument establishes the sequential compactness of a countable product of sequentially compact spaces. However, the product of continuum many copies of the closed unit interval (with its usual topology) fails to be sequentially compact with respect to the product topology, even though it is compact by Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem (e.g., see ).

This is a critical failure: if &quot;X&quot; is a completely regular Hausdorff space, there is a natural embedding from &quot;X&quot; into [0,1]&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,[0,1]), where &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,[0,1]) is the set of continuous maps from &quot;X&quot; to [0,1]. The compactness of [0,1]&quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,[0,1]) thus shows that every completely regular Hausdorff space embeds in a compact Hausdorff space (or, can be &quot;compactified&quot;.) This construction is the Stone–Čech compactification. Conversely, all subspaces of compact Hausdorff spaces are completely regular Hausdorff, so this characterizes the completely regular Hausdorff spaces as those that can be compactified. Such spaces are now called Tychonoff spaces.

== Applications ==

Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem has been used to prove many other mathematical theorems. These include theorems about compactness of certain spaces such as the Banach–Alaoglu theorem on the weak-* compactness of the unit ball of the dual space of a normed vector space, and the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem characterizing the sequences of functions in which every subsequence has a uniformly convergent subsequence. They also include statements less obviously related to compactness, such as the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem stating that every minimal &quot;k&quot;-chromatic graph is finite, and the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem providing a topological characterization of cellular automata.

As a rule of thumb, any sort of construction that takes as input a fairly general object (often of an algebraic, or topological-algebraic nature) and outputs a compact space is likely to use Tychonoff: e.g., the Gelfand space of maximal ideals of a commutative C*-algebra, the Stone space of maximal ideals of a Boolean algebra, and the Berkovich spectrum of a commutative Banach ring.

== Proofs of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem ==

1) Tychonoff&#x27;s 1930 proof used the concept of a complete accumulation point.

2) The theorem is a quick corollary of the Alexander subbase theorem.

More modern proofs have been motivated by the following considerations: the approach to compactness via convergence of subsequences leads to a simple and transparent proof in the case of countable index sets. However, the approach to convergence in a topological space using sequences is sufficient when the space satisfies the first axiom of countability (as metrizable spaces do), but generally not otherwise. However, the product of uncountably many metrizable spaces, each with at least two points, fails to be first countable. So it is natural to hope that a suitable notion of convergence in arbitrary spaces will lead to a compactness criterion generalizing sequential compactness in metrizable spaces that will be as easily applied to deduce the compactness of products. This has turned out to be the case.

3) The theory of convergence via filters, due to Henri Cartan and developed by Bourbaki in 1937, leads to the following criterion: assuming the ultrafilter lemma, a space is compact if and only if each ultrafilter on the space converges. With this in hand, the proof becomes easy: the (filter generated by the) image of an ultrafilter on the product space under any projection map is an ultrafilter on the factor space, which therefore converges, to at least one &quot;xi&quot;. One then shows that the original ultrafilter converges to &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;xi&quot;). In his textbook, Munkres gives a reworking of the Cartan–Bourbaki proof that does not explicitly use any filter-theoretic language or preliminaries.

4) Similarly, the Moore–Smith theory of convergence via nets, as supplemented by Kelley&#x27;s notion of a universal net, leads to the criterion that a space is compact if and only if each universal net on the space converges. This criterion leads to a proof (Kelley, 1950) of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, which is, word for word, identical to the Cartan/Bourbaki proof using filters, save for the repeated substitution of &quot;universal net&quot; for &quot;ultrafilter base&quot;.

5) A proof using nets but not universal nets was given in 1992 by Paul Chernoff.

== Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem and the axiom of choice ==

All of the above proofs use the axiom of choice (AC) in some way. For instance, the third proof uses that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter (i.e., a maximal filter), and this is seen by invoking Zorn&#x27;s lemma. Zorn&#x27;s lemma is also used to prove Kelley&#x27;s theorem, that every net has a universal subnet. In fact these uses of AC are essential: in 1950 Kelley proved that Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem implies the axiom of choice in ZF. Note that one formulation of AC is that the Cartesian product of a family of nonempty sets is nonempty; but since the empty set is most certainly compact, the proof cannot proceed along such straightforward lines. Thus Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem joins several other basic theorems (e.g. that every vector space has a basis) in being &quot;equivalent&quot; to AC.

On the other hand, the statement that every filter is contained in an ultrafilter does not imply AC. Indeed, it is not hard to see that it is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem (BPI), a well-known intermediate point between the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and the ZF theory augmented by the axiom of choice (ZFC). A first glance at the second proof of Tychnoff may suggest that the proof uses no more than (BPI), in contradiction to the above. However, the spaces in which every convergent filter has a unique limit are precisely the Hausdorff spaces. In general we must select, for each element of the index set, an element of the nonempty set of limits of the projected ultrafilter base, and of course this uses AC. However, it also shows that the compactness of the product of compact Hausdorff spaces can be proved using (BPI), and in fact the converse also holds. Studying the &quot;strength&quot; of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem for various restricted classes of spaces is an active area in set-theoretic topology.

The analogue of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem in pointless topology does not require any form of the axiom of choice.

== Proof of the axiom of choice from Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem ==

To prove that Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem in its general version implies the axiom of choice, we establish that every infinite cartesian product of non-empty sets is nonempty. The trickiest part of the proof is introducing the right topology. The right topology, as it turns out, is the cofinite topology with a small twist. It turns out that every set given this topology automatically becomes a compact space. Once we have this fact, Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem can be applied; we then use the finite intersection property (FIP) definition of compactness. The proof itself (due to J. L. Kelley) follows:

Let {&quot;Ai&quot;} be an indexed family of nonempty sets, for &quot;i&quot; ranging in &quot;I&quot; (where &quot;I&quot; is an arbitrary indexing set). We wish to show that the cartesian product of these sets is nonempty. Now, for each &quot;i&quot;, take &quot;Xi&quot; to be &quot;Ai&quot; with the index &quot;i&quot; itself tacked on (renaming the indices using the disjoint union if necessary, we may assume that &quot;i&quot; is not a member of &quot;Ai&quot;, so simply take &quot;Xi&quot; = &quot;Ai&quot; ∪ {&quot;i&quot;}).

Now define the cartesian product
formula_1
along with the natural projection maps &quot;πi&quot; which take a member of &quot;X&quot; to its &quot;i&quot;th term.

We give each &quot;Xj&quot; the topology whose open sets are: the empty set, the singleton {&quot;i&quot;}, the set &quot;Xi&quot;. This makes &quot;Xi&quot; compact, and by Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, &quot;X&quot; is also compact (in the product topology). The projection maps are continuous; all the &quot;Ai&quot;&#x27;s are closed, being complements of the singleton open set {&quot;i&quot;} in &quot;Xi&quot;. So the inverse images π&quot;i&quot;−1(&quot;Ai&quot;) are closed subsets of &quot;X&quot;. We note that
formula_2
and prove that these inverse images have the FIP. Let &quot;i1&quot;, ..., &quot;iN&quot; be a finite collection of indices in &quot;I&quot;. Then the &quot;finite&quot; product &quot;Ai1&quot; × ... × &quot;AiN&quot;
is non-empty (only finitely many choices here, so AC is not needed); it merely consists of &quot;N&quot;-tuples. Let &quot;a&quot; = (&quot;a&quot;1, ..., &quot;aN&quot;) be such an &quot;N&quot;-tuple. We extend &quot;a&quot; to the whole index set: take &quot;a&quot; to the function &quot;f&quot; defined by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) = &quot;ak&quot; if &quot;j&quot; = &quot;ik&quot;, and &quot;f&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) = &quot;j&quot; otherwise. &quot;This step is where the addition of the extra point to each space is crucial&quot;, for it allows us to define &quot;f&quot; for everything outside of the &quot;N&quot;-tuple in a precise way without choices (we can already choose, by construction, &quot;j&quot; from &quot;Xj&quot; ). π&quot;ik&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = &quot;ak&quot; is obviously an element of each &quot;Aik&quot; so that &quot;f&quot; is in each inverse image; thus we have
formula_3

By the FIP definition of compactness, the entire intersection over &quot;I&quot; must be nonempty, and the proof is complete.

<text>Benabarre (), in Ribagorçan and Aragonese: Benavarri () is a town and municipality in the Aragonese comarca of Ribagorza, in the province of Huesca, Spain.

Benabarre is the historical and cultural capital of the comarca. It is part of the geo-linguistic area of La Franja, where Ribagorçan dialect of Catalan is spoken. In ancient texts it appears as &quot;Benabarri&quot;.

It is located in the Pre-Pyrenees, 90 km from Huesca and 65 km from Lleida, at an altitud of 792 m, in a small syncline between Ésera and Cajigar rivers. Most of the territory, however, belongs to the Noguera Ribagorçana basin. To the north we find the Castillo de Laguarres mountain range, and to the south we find the Montsec Range. Through its municipal area runs the N-230 road, that connects Lleida and the Val d&#x27;Aran.

==History==
It is a very old town, probably the Roman &quot;Bargidum&quot; or &quot;Bargusia&quot;, and it is said that it was given to the Arabs taking the name of their first lord Aben Avarre. It was conquered from Islam around the year 1062 (although there is no document proving the exact date). What leaves no doubt is that it was conquered by Ramiro I of Aragon for the Kingdom of Aragon within the same military campaign in which he conquered, immediately north of the town, the places of Luzás, Viacamp y Litera, Tolva, Laguarres and Lascuarre, and to the south of the town, but north of Purroy and Caserras, the lands of Falces, Falcibus, from one of whose houses and its alloys, the king granted a franchise to Agila de Falces and brothers on February 1, 1067 (as documented on that date).

Traditionally, Benabarre was the capital of the historic County of Ribagorza, which was more expansive in territory than today, and included the comarca of Alta Ribagorça, now in the province of Lleida, Catalonia. It was during the Spanish War of Independence, from 1808 to 1814, that the French Napoleonic troops, in retaliation against the inhabitants of Benabarre, decided to make Graus the capital of the comarca. Ever since, Benabarre ceased to be the administrative capital, but it is still the most important cultural and historical center of the region. During the First Carlist War (1833–1840) it was one of the towns that suffered the most from those in the province of Huesca.

==Geography==
===Population centers of the municipality===
* Aler. Term added to Benabarre before 1930. Located at 669 meters of altitude and in the basin of the Ésera river. To the northwest of the place is the hermitage of Nuestra Señora de las Ventosas.
* Entença. Located on the left bank of the Cajigar river. It belongs to Benabarre since 1974. The castle of the town was the origin of the Entença Barony.
* Benabarre (capital of the municipality). (Its streets maintain a medieval structure). Located 1 km to the north is the old Dominican Monastery of Our Lady of Linares.
* Caladrones. It is located on a hill on the left bank of the Río Guart. From the old Castle of Caladrones only the tower remains. In 1974, the municipal term of Caladrones along with its towns: Caladrones, Ciscar and Entença, was annexed to the one of Benabarre.
* Castilló del Pla. Located at the foot of the Corrodella range, at 762 meters of altitude. Previously it was part of the municipality of Pilzán.
* Ciscar. Located at 591 meters of altitude on the right bank of the Cajigar river.
* Estaña. It is located at 716 meters of altitude in the mountains that separate the Guart River and the waters of &quot;La Sosa&quot; (Cinca river).
* Pilzán. At 905 meters of altitude above sea level. Until 1972 it was an independent municipality. The population entities that included the term were: Estaña, Castilló del Pla, the depopulated of Penavera i Cabestany, and la quadra d&#x27;Andolfa.
* Purroy de la Solana. Located above the ravine &quot;El Molí&quot;. Independent term until 1974. The municipality included the hermitage of &quot;Nuestra Señora del Pla&quot;.

==Local festivities==
* June 8th, Saint Medard: patron festivities.
** The most remarkable act is the &quot;pastorada&quot; between the master and the &quot;ramadá&quot; (shepherd), and the typical dance &quot;El ball dels palitrocs&quot;. It is also held the &quot;Baixada de Carricotxes&quot;, a float ornament contest.
* August
**&quot;Ball dels Salvatges&quot;: Recently recovered representation. It is a type of theater with a series of dances starring men of different social status, whose purpose is to conquer a lady. Since 2010 it is a biennial representation.
**The summer carnival is held on the third weekend of August.

Its Holy Week procession is also well known in the Ribagorza, unusual in this sense because the Romans who lead the procession have little to do with the Romans that we can all know, it is a Roman costume with influences of a Renaissance soldier, a complete visual delight for tourists who want to stop and watch this procession on Holy Friday at 10pm from the Our Lady of Valdeflores church square.

==Patrimony==

* The Castle of the Counts of Ribagorça, from the X-XI centuries.
* 19th century parish church.
* Medieval historical center.
* Hermitage of Saint Medard.
* Flour mill.
* Ice well.
* 1932 oil mill.
* 13th century public laundry

Also noticeable are the Hermitage of Santa Maria of Caladrones and the Hermitage of San Salvador of Entença, as well as churches of Saint Romanus of Estaña, Saint Stephen of Estaña, Saint James of Entença, Saint Anne of Caladrones, Santa María of Aler, Saint Cristopher of Ciscar and Saint Michael of Ciscar.

==Illustrious Benabarrenses==
* Juan II de Ribagorza (or Juan de Aragón): count of Ribagorza, lieutenant of Catalonia and viceroy of Naples (1457–1528)
* Pedro García de Benavarre: Gothic painter (15th century)
* Juan Bayarte Calasanz y Ávalos: Governor of Menorca and Ibiza in the 17th century 
* Jaume Santiveri i Piniés: businessman, founder of Santiveri

<text>Valderrobres () or Vall-de-roures () is a municipality and the major town of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Matarraña in the province of Teruel, Aragon (Spain). It is located in view of the landscape of the northwestern foothills of the Ports de Tortosa-Beseit, by the Matarranya River, a tributary to the right of the Ebro. Valderrobres is part of the Taula del Sénia free association of municipalities.

The town has a Gothic church of Santa Maria, a Gothic castle and a Renaissance townhall building. The soprano Elvira de Hidalgo was born in Valderrobres in 1891.

This town and the surrounding &quot;comarca&quot; are considered a part of La Franja and the local dialect is a western variant of Catalan close to Valencian. The name of the town means &quot;Valley of the Oaks&quot;, referred to the presence of Portuguese oak (&quot;roure&quot; or &quot;robre&quot; in local Catalan). However, the main trees in the forests of this town are the Aleppo pine and the black pine, followed by the Evergreen oak.

<doc id="82745" wikidata="Q3265931" url="?curid=82745" title="Lucky Charms">
<text>Lucky Charms is a brand of breakfast cereal produced by General Mills since 1964. The cereal consists of multi-colored marshmallows and pieces of shaped pulverized oat, each resembling one of several objects or symbols associated with good luck. The packaging and marketing features a leprechaun mascot, Lucky.

==History==
Lucky Charms was created in 1964 by product developer John Holahan. General Mills management challenged a team of product developers to use the available manufacturing capacity from either of General Mills&#x27; two principal cereal products—Wheaties or Cheerios—and do something unique. Holahan came up with the idea after a visit to the grocery store in which he decided to mix Cheerios with bits of Brach&#x27;s circus peanuts.

An advertising company employed by General Mills and Company suggested marketing the new cereal around the idea of charm bracelets. Thus, the charms of Lucky Charms were born. Lucky Charms was the first cereal to include marshmallows in the recipe. These pieces are called &quot;marshmallow bits&quot;, or &quot;marbits&quot;, due to their small size. Marbits were invented by Edward S. Olney and Howard S. Thurmon (U.S. patent number 3,607,309, filed November 1, 1968, and assigned September 9, 1971, for &quot;&quot;preparation of marshmallow with milk solids&quot;),&quot; with the patent grant now assigned to Kraftco Corporation.

The mascot of Lucky Charms, created in 1963, is Lucky the Leprechaun, also known as Sir Charms, and originally called L.C. Leprechaun. The cartoon character&#x27;s voice was supplied by the late voice actor Arthur Anderson until 1992. Lucky has also been voiced by Eric Bauza, Tex Brashear, Jason Graae, Doug Preis, and Daniel Ross. In 1975, Lucky the Leprechaun was briefly replaced by Waldo the Wizard in New England, while Lucky remained the mascot in the rest of the United States. Envisioned as a forgetful wizard who was kind to children, Waldo initially prevailed in market tests. However, Waldo&#x27;s creator Alan Snedeker suspects he sealed Waldo&#x27;s fate by working on TV ads that portrayed a nicer version of Lucky.

The oat cereal was not originally sugar-coated. After initial sales failed to meet expectations, the oats were sugar-coated, and the cereal&#x27;s success grew. Piggy banks and plastic watches were introduced as cereal box send-away prizes as a marketing tactic to increase sales. The recipe for the cereal remained unchanged until the introduction of a new flavor: Chocolate Lucky Charms, in 2005. Later in 2012, General Mills introduced &quot;Lucky Charms Marshmallow Treats&quot;.

Following the product launch, the General Mills marketing department found that sales performed dramatically better if the composition of the marbits changed periodically. Various features of the marbits were modified to maximize their appeal to young consumers. Over the years, over 40 limited edition features such as Winter Lucky Charms, Olympic-themed Lucky Charms, and Lucky Charms featuring marshmallow landmarks from around the world were created to drive consumer demands. In focus groups and market research, more brightly colored charms resulted in better sales than did dull or pastel colors. Currently, General Mills conducts &quot;concept-ideation&quot; studies on Lucky Charms.

In April 2022, the FDA opened an investigation into whether Lucky Charms was making people ill after receiving reports from over 100 people that it caused nausea, vomiting and other symptoms. A food safety website iwaspoisoned.com separately documented over 3,000 similar complaints from all over the United States and Canada that started trending upward in 2021. In September 2022, the FDA said it found no pathogen or cause behind 558 self-reported cases of illness “despite extensive testing for numerous potential microbial and chemical adulterants.” 
==Marshmallows==

The first boxes of Lucky Charms cereal contained marshmallows in the shapes of pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers. The lineup has changed occasionally, beginning with the introduction of blue diamonds in 1975, followed by purple horseshoes in 1983, red balloons in 1989, green trees in 1991, rainbows in 1992, blue moons in 1995, leprechaun hats in 1997 (temporarily replaced the green clovers), orange shooting stars and around-the-world charms in 1998 (added blue, green, yellow, purple, and red in 2011), a crystal ball in 2001, an hourglass in 2008, and a unicorn in 2018. In 2013, 6 new rainbow swirl moons and 2 new rainbow charms were introduced. From the original four marshmallows, the permanent roster as of 2013 includes eight marshmallows.

Older marshmallows were phased out periodically. The first shapes to disappear were the yellow moons and blue diamonds, replaced by yellow/orange pots of gold and blue moons respectively in 1994. In 2006, the assortment included purple horseshoes; red balloons; blue crescent-moons; orange and white shooting stars; yellow and orange pots of gold; pink, yellow, and blue rainbows; two-tone green leprechaun hats; pink hearts (the one shape to survive since the beginning); with the most recent addition being the return of the clovers in 2004. In 2008, the Pot of Gold marshmallow was replaced by an hourglass shape. 10 years later, in 2018, the hourglass shape in turn was replaced by a unicorn, which was chosen on social media by way of emojis. The size and brightness of the marshmallows changed in 2004.

Recent changes to the marshmallows include the star shape taking on a &quot;star&quot; design, the orange five-pointed star being complemented by a white &quot;trail&quot;. In late 2005, another marshmallow shape was added, the &quot;Hidden Key&quot;. It is a solid yellow marshmallow that resembles an arched door (similar to the shape of a tombstone; flat at the bottom, flat sides with a round top). When liquid is added to the cereal, the sugar in the marshmallow dissolves and the shape of a skeleton key appears &quot;as if by magic&quot;. The tagline was, &quot;Unlock the door with milk!&quot; This &quot;new&quot; marshmallow type has been used in other hot and cold cereals, but with mixed success (from characters &quot;hidden&quot; inside a bigger marshmallow to letters appearing). In early June 2006, General Mills introduced Magic Mirror marshmallows. In 2008, yellow and orange hourglass marshmallows were introduced with the marketing tagline of, &quot;The Hourglass Charm has the power to Stop Time * Speed Up Time * Reverse Time&quot;. As of 2011, swirled marshmallows and rainbow-colored stars have been introduced.

The marshmallows are meant to represent Lucky&#x27;s magical charms, each with their own special meaning or &quot;power&quot;. , the following are explanations of the permanent marshmallows:

* Heart Charm – Gives life to objects
* Star Charm – Power of flight
* Horseshoe Charm – Power of speed
* Clover Charm – Power of luck
* Blue Moon Charm – Power of invisibility
* Unicorn Charm – Brings color to the world
* Rainbow Charm – Power to teleport
* Red Balloon Charm – Power to float

===Limited edition marshmallows===

There have been more than 30 featured limited edition marshmallow shapes over the years, with the introduction of themed Lucky Charms, such as Winter Lucky Charms. Some of these include:
* In 1986, a whale-shaped marshmallow was temporarily added to the lineup.
* In 1990, a green pine tree-shaped marshmallow was temporarily added to the lineup. During that time, the cereal promoted Earth Day with a free Colorado Blue Spruce seedling with proofs-of-purchase.
* In 1991, the star and balloon shape marshmallows were combined for a short time. The red balloon featured a gold six-pointed star. The star was removed at a later date to make the Red Balloon and Star marshmallows separate.
* In 1994, sprinkles were temporarily added to the marshmallows.
* In 1999, the moon shape marshmallows were modified with the addition of the yellow curve line for a limited time.
* In 2000, a &quot;New Sparkling Rainbow&quot; was added to the mix for a limited time. It was described by General Mills as &quot;a sprinkling of multicolored sugar on a white rainbow marbit&quot;. This marshmallow replaced the original rainbow at this time.
* In 2010, the swirled marshmallows were in Lucky Charms for a limited time.
* In June 2013, two new rainbow marshmallows were added for LGBT Pride Month.
* In 2015, new diamond-shaped marshmallows were added in.
* Introduced in 2017, limited edition cinnamon vanilla Lucky Charms include only snowman, snowball, and snowflake-shaped marshmallows.
* In 2018 a unicorn shaped-marshmallow was added; it became a permanent addition later that year.
* In 2018 winter-themed marshmallows, including snowmen and snowflakes, were added as part of a limited edition chocolatey winter mix.
* In 2021, a limited edition variant of the cereal was promoted called &quot;Loki Charms,&quot; modelled after the Marvel Cinematic Universe Norse God supervillain Loki in promotion of the Disney+ original television series, &quot;Loki&quot;. All supplies of the cereal were sold out in seconds upon release on June 9, 2021.

===Marshmallow-only promotions===
For an advertising campaign in May 2017, General Mills announced they would be promoting 10,000 boxes of cereal that contain only marshmallow pieces. In order to win one of the coveted boxes, consumers would need to purchase a specially marked box of regular Lucky Charms with a code on the inside panel. The code would be entered into an official website to see if the consumer is the winner of one of the 10,000 novelty boxes produced. The sweepstakes ran through December 2017.

In August 2020, General Mills announced it would be selling packages of Lucky Charms marshmallow-pieces-only in retail outlets for a limited time. Each six-ounce bag contains hearts, stars, horseshoes, clovers, blue moons, rainbows, red balloons, and unicorns.

==Theme song==
In the earliest commercials, Lucky Charms cereal had no theme jingle; action was accompanied by a light instrumental &quot;Irish&quot; tune. Soon, however, a simple two-line tag was added:

:&quot;Frosted Lucky Charms,&quot;
:&quot;They&#x27;re magically delicious!&quot;

This simple closer, with the kids usually singing the first line and Lucky singing the second, survived into the 1980s.

Then, with the addition of the purple horseshoe marbit, it was extended into a jingle describing the contents of the box.
This was later revised with the addition of red balloons to the now-familiar &quot;Hearts, stars, horseshoes, clovers, and blue moons, pots of gold, and rainbows, and tasty red balloons!” In 2008, the pot of gold was replaced with the hourglass in the theme song. It was replaced by the Unicorn in 2018.

The jingle is usually accompanied by mentioning that Lucky Charms contains whole-grain ingredients and is part of a balanced meal. General Mills&#x27;s market position is centered on cereals that contain &quot;more whole grain than any other single ingredient, which is significant, because 95 per cent of Americans aren&#x27;t eating minimally 48 grams of whole grain per day as recommended by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines&quot;.

<doc id="82746" wikidata="Q266299" url="?curid=82746" title="Philochorus">
<text>Philochorus of Athens (; ; 340 BC – 261 BC), was a Greek historian and Atthidographer of the third century BC, and a member of a priestly family. He was a seer and interpreter of signs, and a man of considerable influence.

==Biography==
Philochorus was strongly anti-Macedonian in politics, and a bitter opponent of Demetrius Poliorcetes. When Antigonus Gonatas, the son of the latter, besieged and captured Athens (261 BC), Philochorus was put to death for having supported Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt, who had encouraged the Athenians in their resistance to Macedonia.

His investigations into the usages and customs of his native Attica were embodied in an &quot;Atthis&quot;, in seventeen books, a history of Athens from the earliest times to 262 BC. Considerable fragments are preserved in the lexicographers, scholiasts, Athenaeus, and elsewhere. The work was epitomized by the author himself, and later by Asinius Pollio of Tralles (perhaps a freedman of the famous Gaius Asinius Pollio).

Philochorus also wrote on oracles, divination and sacrifices; the mythology and religious observances of the tetrapolis of Attica; the myths of Sophocles; the lives of Euripides and Pythagoras; the foundation of Salamis, Cyprus. He compiled chronological lists of the &quot;archons&quot; and Olympiads, and made a collection of Attic inscriptions, the first of its kind in Greece.

==Critique of his work==
Philostratus was a conscientious and meticulous writer, who placed great importance on chronologies, and his style was clear and succinct.
His works were highly valued throughout antiquity and are frequently referenced by later historians, lexicographers, and commentators, including Plutarch, Athenaeus, Strabo, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Clement of Alexandria, Diogenes Laertius, Harpocration, Stephanus of Byzantium, Zenobius, Hesychius, Eusebius, the Lexicon of Photius, the Great Etymological Dictionary, John Malalas, Tertullian, and the Latin mythographer Fulgentius, among others. 

Over two hundred fragments have survived, most of them from his work &quot;Atthis&quot;.

<doc id="82748" wikidata="Q319273" url="?curid=82748" title="Gaius Asinius Pollio">
<text>Gaius Asinius Pollio (75 BC – AD 4) was a Roman soldier, politician, orator, poet, playwright, literary critic, and historian, whose lost contemporaneous history provided much of the material used by the historians Appian and Plutarch. Pollio was most famously a patron of Virgil and a friend of Horace and poems to him were dedicated by both men.

==Early life==
Asinius Pollio was born in &quot;Teate Marrucinorum&quot;, the modern current Chieti in Abruzzi, central Italy. According to an inscription, his father was called Gnaeus Asinius Pollio. He had a brother named Asinius Marrucinus, whom Catullus calls out for his tasteless practical joke, whose name suggests a family origin among the Marrucini. Pollio may therefore have been the grandson of Herius Asinius, a plebeian and a general of the Marrucini who fought on the Italian side in the Social War.

Pollio moved in the literary circle of Catullus and entered public life in 56 BC by supporting Lentulus Spinther. In 54, he unsuccessfully impeached Gaius Cato, a distant relative of the more famous Cato the Younger. Gaius Porcius Cato had acted as the tool of the triumvirs Pompey, Crassus, and Caesar in his tribunate in 56.

==Political career==
Despite his initial support of Lentulus Spinther in the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, Pollio sided with Caesar. He was present when Caesar deliberated whether to cross the Rubicon and begin the war. After Pompey and the Senate fled to Greece, Caesar sent Pollio to Sicily to relieve Cato of his command. He and Gaius Scribonius Curio were sent to Africa to fight the province&#x27;s governor, the Pompeian Publius Attius Varus. Despite the poisoning of the water supply by his opponents, Curio defeated Varus at Utica. Curio marched to face Pompey&#x27;s ally King Juba of Numidia, and was defeated and killed, along with most of his men, at the Bagradas River. Pollio managed to retreat to Utica with a small force. He was present as Caesar&#x27;s legate at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 and recorded Pompeian casualties at 6,000.

In 47, Pollio was probably tribune and resisted the efforts of another tribune, Publius Cornelius Dolabella, to cancel all debts. He returned to Africa the following year, this time with Caesar, in pursuit of Cato and Metellus Scipio.

==Time in Hispania==
When Caesar was assassinated in 44, Pollio was leading his forces in Hispania against Sextus Pompeius and distinguishing himself early in the campaign. He had accepted the commission reluctantly because of a personal enmity with another of Caesar&#x27;s allies. Marcus Aemilius Lepidus was appointed the new governor of the province, but Pollio, while remaining loyal to Caesar&#x27;s supporters, held out against him, announcing at Corduba that he would not hand over his province to anyone who did not have a commission from the Senate. A few months later his &quot;quaestor,&quot; Lucius Cornelius Balbus, absconded from Gades with the money intended to pay the soldiers and fled to Mauretania. Pollio was then so severely defeated by Pompeius that he had to escape the battlefield in disguise.

==Role in civil war==
As civil war brewed between Mark Antony and Octavian, Pollio vacillated, but ultimately threw in his lot with Mark Antony. Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian soon joined forces in the Second Triumvirate. In their series of bloody proscriptions, Pollio&#x27;s father-in-law, Lucius Quintius, was one of the first to be marked for assassination. He fled by sea, but committed suicide by throwing himself overboard. In the division of the provinces, Gaul fell to Antony, who entrusted Pollio with the administration of Gallia Transpadana (the part of Cisalpine Gaul between the Po and the Alps). In superintending the distribution of the Mantuan territory amongst the veterans, he used his influence to save the property of the poet Virgil from confiscation.

In 40, Pollio helped to arrange the peace of Brundisium by which Octavian and Antony were for a time reconciled. In the same year, Pollio entered upon his consulship, which had been promised him in 43 by the Second Triumvirate. Virgil addressed the famous fourth &quot;eclogue&quot; to him, although there is uncertainty regarding whether Virgil composed the poem in anticipation of Pollio&#x27;s consulship or to celebrate his part in the Treaty of Brundisium. Virgil, like other Romans, hoped that peace was at hand and looked forward to a Golden Age under Pollio&#x27;s consulship. However, Pollio did not complete his consular year. He and his co-consul were removed from office by Antony and Octavian in the final months of the year.

The following year, Pollio conducted a successful campaign against the Parthini, an Illyrian people who adhered to Marcus Junius Brutus, and celebrated a triumph on 25 October. Virgil&#x27;s eighth &quot;eclogue&quot; was addressed to Pollio while he was engaged in this campaign.

In 31, Octavian asked him to take part in the Battle of Actium against Antony, but Pollio, remembering the kindness that Antony had shown him, remained neutral.

==Later life==
From the spoils of the war Pollio constructed the first public library at Rome, in the &quot;Atrium Libertatis&quot;, also erected by him, which he adorned with statues of the most celebrated heroes. The library had Greek and Latin wings, and reportedly its establishment posthumously fulfilled one of Caesar&#x27;s ambitions.

There was a magnificent art collection attached to this library. Pollio loved Hellenistic art at its most imaginative. Like the library, the art gallery was open to the public.

After his military and political successes, Pollio appears to have retired into private life as a patron of literary figures and a writer. He was known as a severe literary critic, fond of an archaic style and purity.

In retirement, Pollio organized literary readings where he encouraged authors to read their own work, and he was the first Roman author to recite his own works. One of the most dramatic such readings brought the poet Virgil to the attention of the imperial family, when Virgil read from his work-in-progress the &quot;Aeneid,&quot; and flattered the imperial family by his portrayal of Aeneas, whom the Julii Caesares believed to be their direct patrilineal ancestor. As a result, Virgil was praised by Augustus.

Pollio may have died in his villa at Tusculum. He was apparently a staunch republican, and thus held himself somewhat aloof from Augustus.

==Personal life==
Married to Quinctia, daughter of Lucius Quinctius, who was proscribed and committed suicide in 43, Pollio had at least one daughter, Asinia, and one son, Gaius Asinius Gallus, the second husband of Vipsania Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, Augustus&#x27;s partner, second-in-command, and second son-in-law. Gallus and Vipsania had several sons together, two of whom were full consuls and a third was &quot;consul suffectus&quot;.

==Legacy==
Although now lost, Pollio&#x27;s contemporary history provided much of the material for the historians Appian and Plutarch. As such, he significantly influenced posterity&#x27;s perception of his time—a key moment in Roman history. According to the poet Horace (&quot;Odes&quot; 2.1.1–4), he dated the start of the Civil Wars to the consulship of Quintus Metellus Celer in 60 BC.

Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, a Dutch statesman of the nineteenth century, wrote a thesis about Pollio at the University of Leiden.

Pollio makes a cameo appearance in Robert Graves&#x27;s novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, where he discusses the ethics of writing history with young Claudius and Titus Livius.

<doc id="82752" wikidata="Q769628" url="?curid=82752" title="Metropolitan county">
<text>Metropolitan counties are a subdivision of England which were originally used for local government. There are six metropolitan counties: Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands and West Yorkshire.

The metropolitan counties were created in 1974 as part of a reform of local government in England and Wales. They were the top tier of a two-tier system of counties and metropolitan boroughs, and were created to govern large urban areas. In 1986 their county councils were abolished, and since then the metropolitan counties have had no local government role. The local government functions were largely taken over by the metropolitan boroughs, with joint boards created to co-ordinate some county-wide services. The metropolitan counties are all ceremonial counties which share their borders.

All of the metropolitan boroughs belong to combined authorities, which are statutory bodies introduced in 2011 that allow local authorities to voluntarily pool responsibilities and collaborate. The combined authorities for Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, West Midlands and West Yorkshire cover the same areas as the metropolitan counties; the boroughs of Merseyside are part of the Liverpool City Region, and those of Tyne and Wear are part of the North East Combined Authority.

==Counties and districts==
The six metropolitan counties and their metropolitan districts are:

==History==

===Creation===
The idea of creating administrative areas based upon the large conurbations outside London, modelled on the County of London or Greater London, was mooted several times in the 20th century. In 1948, the Local Government Boundary Commission proposed several new counties, including &#x27;South East Lancashire North East Cheshire&#x27; (&quot;Selnec&quot;), and &#x27;South West Lancashire North West Cheshire&#x27;. In the 1960s the Local Government Commission for England proposed such an arrangement for Tyneside and draft proposals considered it for Selnec. For the West Midlands conurbation, the commission proposed instead a group of contiguous county boroughs with no overall metropolitan authority.

The Redcliffe-Maud Report of 1969 proposed the creation of three large &quot;metropolitan areas&quot; based upon the conurbations surrounding Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham (Selnec, Merseyside, and West Midlands), which were to have both metropolitan councils covering the entire areas, and district councils covering parts. Harold Wilson&#x27;s government published a white paper broadly accepting these recommendations, and adding South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire as metropolitan areas.

The proposals were radically altered when Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservative government came to power in 1970. The Conservatives&#x27; local government white paper was published in February 1971, naming the metropolitan areas &quot;metropolitan counties&quot;, and giving them as &quot;Merseyside, south-east Lancashire and north-east Cheshire, the West Midlands, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, and the Tyne and Wear area&quot;.

The proposed counties were also far smaller than in the original proposals; they were trimmed at each successive stage. The Redcliffe-Maud Report had included Chester in Merseyside and Redditch and Stafford in West Midlands. The Conservative policy favoured retaining historic boundaries as far as was practicable, and the new white paper proposals generally reduced the metropolitan counties to the continuously built up area. Many areas on the edges were excluded from the metropolitan counties when the bill was passed: Easington, Harrogate, Knaresborough, Ellesmere Port, Neston, New Mills, Whaley Bridge and Glossop; other areas were excluded during the bill&#x27;s passage, such as Seaham, Skelmersdale and Holland, Poynton and Wilmslow. One area, the county borough of Southport, was added to Merseyside in the bill, at the local council&#x27;s request.

Several other proposals for metropolitan counties were made during the bill&#x27;s passage, including a revival of the proposal for Hampshire (either the southern part or all of it) and central Lancashire. A Thamesside metropolitan county, covering areas of north Kent and south Essex on the Thames Estuary (and now considered part of the Thames Gateway) was also proposed.

The metropolitan counties were created by the Local Government Act 1972. The county councils were first elected in 1973, and were formally established in April 1974.

===Structure===
The metropolitan counties were first created with a two-tier structure of local government. Local government functions were divided between the metropolitan district councils as lower tier authorities and metropolitan county councils as the upper tier.

The structure differed from the non-metropolitan counties in the allocation of powers between the county and district councils. The metropolitan districts had more powers than non-metropolitan districts, in that they were additionally responsible for education and social services, responsibilities allocated to county councils elsewhere.

The metropolitan county councils were intended to be strategic authorities that ran regional services such as main roads, public transport, emergency services, civil protection, waste disposal, and strategic town and country planning. The metropolitan county councils functioned between 1974 and 1986.

===Abolition of the county councils===
Just a decade after they were established, the mostly Labour-controlled metropolitan county councils (MCCs) and the Greater London Council (GLC) had several high-profile clashes with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher about overspending and high rates. 
Government policy on the issue was considered throughout 1982, and the Conservative Party put a &quot;promise to scrap the metropolitan county councils&quot;, and the GLC, in their manifesto for the 1983 general election.

The exact details of the reform caused problems. In October 1983, Thatcher&#x27;s government published a white paper entitled &quot;Streamlining the cities&quot; which set out detailed plans for the abolition of the MCCs, together with the abolition of the GLC.

The bill was announced in the Queen&#x27;s Speech and was introduced into Parliament soon afterwards. It became the Local Government Act 1985; the MCCs and the GLC were abolished at midnight on 31 March 1986.

The last elections to the councils were held in May 1981; elections that would have been held in 1985 were abandoned under the Local Government (Interim Provisions) Act 1984; the original plan had been for councillors&#x27; terms to expire in April 1985, and for councillors to be replaced by nominees from borough councils until 1986.

While the abolition of the GLC was highly controversial, the abolition of the MCCs was much less so. The Liberal Party leader David Steel had supported abolition of the MCCs in his 1981 conference speech. The government&#x27;s stated reasons for the abolition of the MCCs were based on efficiency and their overspending.

However the fact that all of the county councils were controlled by the Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: the general secretary of the National and Local Government Officers&#x27; Association described it as a &quot;completely cynical manoeuvre&quot;. Merseyside in particular put up a struggle against abolition. Most of the functions of the MCCs passed either to the metropolitan borough councils, or to joint boards. Some assets were given to residuary bodies for disposal. The split of functions from the metropolitan county councils was as follows:

===Current status===
The metropolitan counties are sometimes referred to as &quot;former metropolitan counties&quot;, although this description is not entirely correct. The county councils were abolished, but under the Local Government Act 1972, the counties themselves remain in existence, although they no longer exist in ISO 3166-2:GB as extant administrative subdivisions.

By virtue of the Lieutenancies Act 1997 they remain as ceremonial counties (sometimes called &#x27;geographic counties&#x27;) which have an appointed Lord Lieutenant. They are also used in certain government statistics, although they no longer appear on Ordnance Survey maps, which show the individual metropolitan boroughs.

Some local services are still run on a metropolitan county-wide basis, administered by statutory joint boards and special joint arrangements; these include policing (by joint police authorities), fire services, public transport (by passenger transport executives) and waste disposal (in Merseyside and Greater Manchester). These joint boards are made up of councillors appointed by the boroughs. Since 2000, the metropolitan counties have been used as the areas of joint local transport plans.

In 1999, following a successful referendum, the Labour government under Tony Blair legislated to create a strategic authority for London (the Greater London Authority). Despite some talk of doing so, no bodies were established to replace the MCCs. The Blair government instead pursued the idea of elected regional assemblies, although after an unsuccessful referendum in the most positive region, the North East, this idea now has few proponents. The idea of city regions has been proposed subsequently, although the 2006 local government white paper had no firm proposals for formal recognition of this concept. This changed in 2010 when the Government accepted a proposal from the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities to establish a Greater Manchester Combined Authority as an indirectly elected, top tier, strategic authority for Greater Manchester. In 2014 similar indirectly elected combined authorities were established for the metropolitan counties of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, and two combined authorities were established which each covered a metropolitan county and adjacent non-metropolitan districts: the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority for Merseyside and the Borough of Halton unitary authority, and the North East Combined Authority for Tyne and Wear and the unitary authorities of County Durham and Northumberland. In 2017 the West Midlands Combined Authority was established for the West Midlands county. Many of these new combined authorities have elected or are in the process of electing authority-wide regional mayors.

Since 1995, the cities of Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield have assembled together in the Core Cities Group. This organisation accords no distinct legal status on these councils over any other city council in England but appears to be organically moving towards some kind of recognition of their role as regional capitals outside London.

<text>Hippodrome is a term sometimes used for public entertainment venues of various types. A modern example is the Hippodrome which opened in London in 1900 &quot;combining circus, hippodrome, and stage performances&quot;.

It is derived from the ancient Greek &quot;hippodromos&quot; (), a stadium for horse racing and chariot racing. The name is derived from the Greek words &quot;hippos&quot; (ἵππος; &quot;horse&quot;) and &quot;dromos&quot; (δρόμος; &quot;course&quot;). The ancient Roman version, the circus, was similar to the Greek hippodrome.

==Description==

One end of the &quot;hippodromos&quot; of the Ancient Greeks was semicircular, while the other was a quadrilateral with an extensive portico. At the front thereof, at a lower level, were the stalls for the horses and chariots. On either end of the &quot;hippodromos&quot; were posts (Greek &quot;termata&quot;) around which the chariots turned. This was the most dangerous part of the track and the Greeks put an altar to Taraxippus (disturber of horses) there to show the spot where many chariots were wrecked. Where possible, it was built on the slope of a hill and the ground excavated from one side was transferred to the other to form an embankment thereat.

<text>Hippodamus of Miletus (; Greek: Ἱππόδαμος ὁ Μιλήσιος, &quot;Hippodamos ho Milesios&quot;; c.480–408 BC) was an ancient Greek architect, urban planner, physician, mathematician, meteorologist and philosopher, who is considered to be &quot;the father of European urban planning&quot;, and the namesake of the &quot;Hippodamian plan&quot; (grid plan) of city layout, although rectangular city plans were in use by the ancient Greeks as early as the 8th c. BC.

Hippodamus was born in Miletus and lived during the 5th century BC. His father was Euryphon. According to Aristotle, Hippodamus was the first author who wrote upon the theory of government, without any knowledge of practical affairs.

His plans of Greek cities were characterised by order and regularity in contrast to the intricacy and confusion common to cities of that period, even Athens. He is seen as the originator of the idea that a town plan might formally embody and clarify a rational social order. However, as cities were built with orthogonal plans centuries before his birth, he cannot be the originator of the concept.

==Personality==

He is referred to in the works of Aristotle, Stobaeus, Strabo, Hesychius, Photius, and Theano.

He evidently had a reputation as a lover of attention. According to Aristotle&#x27;s description in &quot;Politics&quot;, &quot;Some people thought he carried things too far, indeed, with his long hair, expensive ornaments, and the same cheap warm clothing worn winter and summer.&quot;

In the treatise &quot;On Virtue&quot;, Theano (apparently the wife of Pythagoras) addressed a certain Hippodamus of Thurium (presumably this same man) that her work contains the doctrine of the golden mean.

==Achievements==
===The &quot;Best State&quot;===
According to Aristotle (in &quot;Politics&quot; ii.8), Hippodamus was a pioneer of urban planning, and he devised an ideal city to be inhabited by 10,000 men (free male citizens), while the overall population (including women, children, and slaves) would reach 50,000. He studied the functional problems of cities and linked them to the state administration system. As a result, he divided the citizens into three classes (soldiers, artisans and &#x27;husbandmen&#x27;), with the land also divided into three (sacred, public and private).

Aristotle criticized the monopolization of arms-bearing by a single class in Hippodamus&#x27; &quot;Best State&quot; writings, arguing that this would lead to oppression of the &quot;farmers&quot; and the &quot;workers&quot; by the arms-bearing class. Aristotle&#x27;s own concept of polity included a large middle class in which each citizen fulfilled all three functions of self-legislation, arms bearing, and working.&quot;

===Urban planner===
According to Aristotle, he was the first urban planner to focus attention to proper arrangements of cities. He laid out the Piraeus (the port of Athens) for Pericles, with wide streets radiating from the central Agora, which was generally called the Hippodameia (Ἱπποδάμεια) in his honour, and built the refounded city of Rhodes in the form of a theater. In 440 BC he went out among the Athenian colonists and planned the new city of Thurium (later Thurii), in Magna Graecia, with streets crossing at right angles; as a consequence he is sometimes referred to as Hippodamus of Thurium. His principles were later adopted in many important cities, such as Halicarnassus, Alexandria and Antioch.

Strabo credited the architect of Piraeus with the layout of the new city of Rhodes in 408 BC; however, as Hippodamus was involved in 479 BC with helping the reconstruction of Miletus he would have been very old when this project took place.

The grid plans attributed to him consisted of series of broad, straight streets, cutting one another at right angles. In Miletus we can find the prototype plan of Hippodamus. What is most impressive in his plan is a wide central area, which was kept unsettled according to his macro-scale urban prediction/estimation and in time evolved to the &quot;Agora&quot;, the centre of both the city and the society.

===Writings===
The &quot;Urban Planning Study for Piraeus&quot; (451 BC), which is considered to be a work of Hippodamus, formed the planning standards of that era and was used in many cities of the classical epoch. According to this study, neighbourhoods of around 2,400 m2 blocks were constructed where small groups of 2-floor houses were built. The houses were lined up with walls separating them while the main facets were towards the south. The same study uses polynomial formulas for the pumping infrastructure manufacture.

==Philosophy==
From Hippodamus came the earliest notions of patent law. Hippodamus proposed that society should reward those individuals who create things useful for society. Aristotle criticized the practical utilitarian approach of Hippodamus and implicated the inherent tension in rewarding individuals for doing good; i.e. that by rewarding individuals for doing good, the individuals will do good for the reward over the benefit of the state. The state could actually suffer because of the allure of individual rewards, since individuals may propose notions that weaken the state. Aristotle essentially foreshadowed the inherent tension between private rewards for social benefits - the potential diversion between individual and societal interests. Aristotle&#x27;s greatest criticism of Hippodamus, however, is that rewarding individuals &quot;who discover something advantageous for the city ... is not safe, though it sounds appealing.&quot; For while innovation is of great benefit to the arts and sciences, &quot;change in an art is not like change in law; for law has no strength with respect to obedience apart from habit, and this is not created except over a period of time. Hence the easy alteration of existing laws in favour of new and different ones weakens the power of law itself.&quot;

Hippodamus does not seem to have been involved in politics, but several writings attributed to him dealt with issues of the state, including Περί Πολιτείας (On the State), Περί Ευδαιμονίας (On Happiness), Πυθαγορίζουσαι Θεωρίαι (Pythagoras Theorems).

<text>The 1992 Summer Olympics (, ), officially the Games of the XXV Olympiad (, ) and officially branded as Barcelona &#x27;92, were an international multi-sport event held from 25 July to 9 August 1992 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Beginning in 1994, the International Olympic Committee decided to hold the Summer and Winter Olympics in alternating even-numbered years. The 1992 Summer and Winter Olympics were the last games to be staged in the same year. These games were the second and last two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Western Europe after the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, held five months earlier.

The 1992 Games received universal acclaim, with the organisation, volunteers, sportsmanship, and Spanish public being lauded in the international media. Some media describe the Barcelona games as one of the best Olympics ever. The Games showed a renewed image of democratic Spain and projected Barcelona and the whole Spain to the world. Thanks to the Games, the city of Barcelona was completely transformed; it is thanks to the Olympics that the Barcelona of today is built. All the venues are still active and the legacy of the 1992 Games was taken as an example for future Olympic events, such as London 2012.

The 1992 Summer Games were the first since the end of the Cold War, and the first unaffected by boycotts since the 1972 Summer Games. 1992 was also the first year South Africa was re-invited to the Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee, after a 32-year ban from participating in international sport due to apartheid. The Unified Team (made up by the former Soviet republics without the Baltic states) topped the medal table, winning 45 gold and 112 overall medals.

== Host city selection ==
Barcelona is the second-largest city in Spain and the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, and the hometown of then-IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and the famous European club, FC Barcelona. The city was also a host for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. On 17 October 1986, Barcelona was selected to host the 1992 Summer Olympics over Amsterdam, Netherlands (the city also hosted the 1928 games); Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Birmingham, United Kingdom; Brisbane, Australia; and Paris, France, during the 91st IOC Session in Lausanne, Switzerland. New Delhi, India, had announced a bid for the games, but withdrew in March 1986. With 85 out of 89 members of the IOC voting by secret ballot, Barcelona won a majority of 47 votes. Samaranch abstained from voting. In the same IOC meeting, Albertville, France, won the right to host the 1992 Winter Games. Paris and Brisbane would eventually be selected to host the 2024 and 2032 Summer Olympics respectively.

Barcelona had previously bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics that were ultimately held in Berlin, Germany. As an anti-fascist response against the Games being organized by Nazi Germany, the Government of Catalonia and the newly elected Spanish Popular Front government, advocated for the boycott of the Spanish Republic to the Berlin Games and the organization of an alternative games in Barcelona, known as the People&#x27;s Olympiad. However, the same day of its planned inauguration (19 July), the Spanish Army carried out a coup d&#x27;état which led to the Spanish Civil War.

== Highlights ==

* At the innovative opening ceremony, Greek mezzo-soprano Agnes Baltsa sang &quot;Romiossini&quot; as the Olympic flag was paraded around the stadium. Alfredo Kraus later sang the Olympic Hymn in Catalan, Spanish and French, as the flag was hoisted.
* The Olympic cauldron was ignited using a flaming arrow, lit from the flame of the Olympic torch. It was shot by Paralympic archer Antonio Rebollo, who aimed the arrow over the top of the cauldron to ignite the gas emanating from it. The arrow landed outside the stadium. This unusual method for lighting the cauldron had been carefully designed to avoid any chance of the arrow landing in the stadium if Rebollo missed his target.
* South Africa rejoined the Summer Olympics having been banned for its apartheid policy after the 1960 Summer Olympics. The women&#x27;s 10,000 metres event was hotly contested. White South African runner Elana Meyer and black Ethiopian runner Derartu Tulu (winner) ran hand-in-hand in a victory lap.
* Germany sent a unified team having reunified in 1990, the last such team was at the 1964 Summer Olympics.
* As the Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, the formerly Soviet-occupied states of Estonia and Latvia sent their own teams for the first time since 1936, while Lithuania sent its own team for the first time since 1928. The other former Soviet republics decided to compete together and formed the Unified Team, which consisted of present-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. The Unified Team finished first in the medal standings, edging the United States.
* The separation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia led to the Olympic debuts of Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Due to United Nations sanctions, athletes from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (consisting of present-day Serbia and Montenegro) were not allowed to participate with their own team. However, some individual athletes competed under the Olympic flag as Independent Olympic Participants. Serbia would return to the Olympics at the 2008 Summer Olympics and as well as Montenegro on what would be its Olympic debut as separate states.
* In basketball, the admittance of NBA players led to the formation of the &quot;Dream Team&quot; of the United States, featuring Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and other NBA stars. Prior to 1992, only European and South American professionals were allowed to compete, while the Americans used college players. The Dream Team won the gold medal and was inducted as a unit into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.
* Fermín Cacho won the 1,500 m in his home country, earning Spain&#x27;s first-ever Olympic gold medal in a running event.
* Chinese diver Fu Mingxia, age 13, became one of the youngest Olympic gold medalists of all time.
* In men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, Vitaly Scherbo from Belarus, (representing the Unified Team), won six gold medals, including four in a single day. Scherbo tied Eric Heiden&#x27;s record for individual gold medals at a single Olympics, winning five medals in an individual event (Michael Phelps would later equal this record in 2008).
* In women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, Tatiana Gutsu took gold in the All-Around competition edging the USA&#x27;s Shannon Miller.
* Russian swimmers (competing for the Unified Team) dominated the men&#x27;s freestyle events, with Alexander Popov and Yevgeny Sadovyi each winning two events. Sadovyi also won in the relays.
* Evelyn Ashford won her fourth Olympic gold medal in the 4×100-metre relay, making her one of only four female athletes to have achieved this in history.
* The young Krisztina Egerszegi of Hungary won three individual swimming gold medals.
* In women&#x27;s 200 m breaststroke, Kyoko Iwasaki of Japan won a gold medal at the age of 14 years and six days, making her the youngest-ever gold medalist in swimming competitions at the Olympics.
* Algerian athlete Hassiba Boulmerka, who was frequently criticized by Muslim groups in Algeria who thought she showed too much of her body when racing, received death threats and was forced to move to Europe to train, won the 1,500 metres, also holding the African women&#x27;s record in this distance.
* After being demonstrated in six previous Summer Olympic Games, baseball officially became an Olympic sport. Badminton and women&#x27;s judo also became part of the Olympic program, while slalom canoeing returned to the Games after a 20-year absence.
* Roller hockey, Basque pelota, and taekwondo were all demonstrated at the 1992 Summer Olympics.
* Several of the USA men&#x27;s volleyball gold medal team from the 1988 Olympics returned to vie for another medal. In the preliminary round, they lost a controversial match to Japan, sparking them to shave their heads in protest. This notably included player Steve Timmons, sacrificing his trademark red flattop for the protest. The U.S. team ultimately progressed to the playoffs and won bronze.
* Mike Stulce of the United States won the men&#x27;s shot put, beating the heavily favored Werner Günthör of Switzerland.
* On the 20th anniversary of the Munich massacre and the 500th anniversary of the Alhambra Decree, Yael Arad became the first Israeli to win an Olympic medal, winning a silver medal in judo. The next day, Oren Smadja became Israel&#x27;s first male medalist, winning a bronze in the same sport.
* Derek Redmond of Great Britain tore a hamstring during a 400-meter semi-final heat. As he struggled to finish the race, his father entered the track without credentials and helped him complete the race, to a standing ovation from the crowd.
* Gail Devers came into the 100 meters hurdles as the favorite. Though her Olympic history shows her winning the 100 meters dash twice, the first time earlier in this Olympics, she primarily made her career as a hurdler. And true to form, Devers had a commanding lead in this race until the final hurdle. Devers came up short and hit the hurdle, foot first, hard, knocking her off balance. She stumbled toward the finish line, falling on the last step, but still finished fifth, .001 out of fourth place. Paraskevi Patoulidou of Greece won the gold medal to even her own disbelief, dropping to her knees on the track when she realized she had won.
* Jennifer Capriati won the singles tennis competition at the age of 16. She had previously earned a spot in the semifinals of two grand slams at the age of 14.
* Two gold medals were awarded in solo synchronized swimming after a judge inadvertently entered the score of &quot;8.7&quot; instead of the intended &quot;9.7&quot; in the computerized scoring system for one of Sylvie Fréchette&#x27;s figures. This error ultimately placed Fréchette second, leaving Kristen Babb-Sprague for the gold medal. Following an appeal, FINA awarded Fréchette a gold medal, replacing her silver medal and leaving the two swimmers both with gold.
* Indonesia won its first-ever gold medal after winning a silver at 1988 Olympics. Susi Susanti won the gold in badminton women&#x27;s singles after defeating Bang Soo-hyun in the final round. Alan Budikusuma won the badminton men&#x27;s singles competition, earning a second gold medal for Indonesia. Several years later, both players married and they received the nickname golden couple or Olympic couple.

Croatia and Slovenia made their first Summer Olympic appearance at these games, having participated at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville.

The 1992 Summer Olympics notably marked Germany competing as a unified team for the first time since 1964 and the first time since 1936 as a single nation following German reunification. South Africa returned to the Games for the first time in 32 years.

The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was banned due to UN sanctions, but individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as Independent Olympic Participants. Four then-existing National Olympic Committees did not send any athletes to compete: Afghanistan, Brunei, Liberia and Somalia.

=== Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee ===
9,356 athletes from 169 NOCs

==Broadcasting==
===International signal===
In order to guarantee that the international signal was produced objectively and impartially, for the first time in Olympic history, a host broadcaster was expressly created for each of the 1992 Olympic Games instead of delegating responsibility to a national host broadcaster. The Albertville Organizing Committee created the Organisme de radio télévision olympique &#x27;92 (ORTO&#x27;92) for the Winter Olympics and the Barcelona Organizing Committee created the Ràdio Televisió Olímpica &#x27;92 (RTO&#x27;92) for the Summer Olympics.

RTO&#x27;92 managed the staff and the production and technical resources hired to Radiotelevisión Española (RTVE), the Corporació Catalana de Ràdio i Televisió (CCRTV) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). With a workforce of 3,083 people, a permanent radio and television installation at the Olympic Stadium and Palau Sant Jordi, and over 50 mobile units for other venues, RTO&#x27;92 provided live coverage of all Summer Olympic sports for the first time ever –except for a few preliminary events–, some 2,800 hours of live television footage, to its international rights-holders. The International Broadcast Centre (IBC) was located at the exhibition halls of Fira de Barcelona in Montjuïc.

NHK and Panasonic developed the 1/2&quot; DX digital system used to record the Games digitally for the first time. Also new were the underwater camera dolly on a track at the bottom of the swimming pool, the underwater microcameras at the bottom of the water polo pool, the periscope camera capable of transmit shots from below and above the water, the overhead camera dolly on a track along the canopy of the Olympic Stadium for the high zenithal shot of the athletics track, the stabilized optic gyro-zoom cameras, the super slow motion PAL camera and the microcamera on the high jump bar.

===Personalized coverage===
To cover the Games, major international broadcasting unions such as the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT), the Organización de Televisión Iberoamericana (OTI), the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU), the Caribbean Broadcasting Union (CBU) and the Union of African National Television and Radio Organizations (URTNA), secured the rights for their member broadcasters in their countries. In other countries, broadcast networks secured the rights directly or pooled to secure the rights. The Games were covered by the following television and radio broadcasters:
===HDTV coverage===
The 1992 Winter and Summer Olympics were the first in which a comprehensive coverage in high-definition television (HDTV) was attempted. The European HDTV broadcast of the Summer Olympics was managed by the joint venture &quot;Barcelona 1250&quot; created by RTO&#x27;92, RTVE, Retevisión and PESA, with the financial support of the European Economic Community and a workforce of over 300 production and technical staff. A total of 225 hours and 45 minutes was broadcast in analog HD-MAC standard in 1,250 lines and 16:9 aspect ratio, with commentary in five languages –Spanish, English, French, German and Italian– in addition to the non-commentary sound track, of eighteen different sports at seventeen venues, as well as the opening and closing ceremonies. Events from five venues were covered live –80% of the total broadcast time– and other events were recorded for a delayed broadcast. On-screen text and graphics were shown in HDTV for the first time ever. Nearly 700 viewing sites installed throughout Europe, including the fifty HDTV receivers installed in various pavilions at the Seville Universal Exposition, were able to receive the broadcast.

For Japan, NHK also covered the 1992 Summer Olympics in HDTV in their own analog Hi-Vision system.

==Political controversies and terrorism==
On the eve of the Olympics, between 29 June and 14 July 1992, the police operation later known as &quot;Operation Garzón&quot; saw the arrest of 45 Catalan pro-independence activists, journalists and politicians, under the accusation of belonging to the armed Catalan pro-independence and socialist organisation Terra Lliure (which already announced its dissolution in 1991), many of them without real proof. 25 of the arrested were kept in solitary confinement. They denounced torture at the hands of the Spanish police and threats of violence and rape to them and their families, as well as constant Anti-Catalan and Catalanophobic insults. 

Political activists argue that the Spanish State used the Operation Garzón as a tool, under the pretext of security during the Olympic Games, to weaken the left-wing branch of Catalan independence movement.

The Basque nationalist group ETA attempted to disrupt the Barcelona Games with terrorist attacks. It was already feared beforehand that ETA would use the Olympics to gain publicity for their cause in front of a worldwide audience. As the time of the Games approached, ETA committed attacks in Barcelona and the Catalonia region as a whole, including the deadly 1991 Vic bombing. On 10 July 1992, the group offered a two-month truce covering the Olympics in exchange for negotiations, which the Spanish government rejected. However, the Games went ahead successfully without an attack.

== Effect on the city ==

The celebration of the 1992 Olympic Games had an enormous impact on the urban culture and outward projection of Barcelona. The Games provided billions of dollars for infrastructure investments, which are considered to have improved the quality of life in the city, and its attraction for investment and tourism. Barcelona became one of the most visited cities in Europe after Paris, London, and Rome.

Barcelona&#x27;s nomination for the 1992 Summer Olympics sparked the implementation of an ambitious plan for urban transformation that had already been developed previously. Barcelona was opened to the sea with the construction of the Olympic Village and Olympic Port in Poblenou. New centers were created, and modern sports facilities were built in the Olympic zones of Montjuïc, Diagonal, and Vall d&#x27;Hebron; hotels were also refurbished and new ones built. The construction of ring roads around the city helped to reduce traffic density, and El Prat airport was modernized and expanded with the opening of two new terminals.

=== Cost and cost overrun ===
The &quot;Oxford Olympics Study&quot; estimates the direct costs of the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics to be US$9.7 billion (expressed in 2015 U.S. dollars) with a cost overrun of 266%. This includes only sports-related costs, that is: (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, direct transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services; and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, media and press center, and similar structures required to host the Games. Costs &quot;excluded&quot; from the study are indirect capital and infrastructure costs, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games.

The costs for Barcelona 1992 may be compared with those of London 2012, which cost US$15 billion with a cost overrun of 76%, and those of Rio 2016 which cost US$4.6 billion with a cost overrun of 51%. The average cost for the Summer Olympics since 1960 is US$5.2 billion, with an average cost overrun of 176%.

== Songs and themes ==
There were two main musical themes for the 1992 Games. The first one was &quot;Barcelona&quot;, a classical crossover song composed five years earlier by Freddie Mercury and Mike Moran; Mercury was an admirer of lyric soprano Montserrat Caballé, both recorded the official theme as a duet. Due to Mercury&#x27;s death eight months earlier, the duo was unable to perform the song together during the opening ceremony. A recording of the song instead played over a travelogue of the city at the start of the opening ceremony, seconds before the official countdown. 
&quot;Amigos Para Siempre&quot; (&quot;Friends for Life&quot;) was the other musical theme and it was official theme song of the 1992 Summer Olympics. It was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Don Black, and sung by Sarah Brightman and José Carreras during the closing ceremonies.

Ryuichi Sakamoto composed and conducted some musical pieces at the opening ceremony musical score. The Opening Olympic fanfare was composed by Angelo Badalamenti and with orchestrations by Joseph Turrin.

== Mascot ==
The official mascot was Cobi, a Catalan sheepdog in cubist style designed by Javier Mariscal. He was widely featured in merchandising products and starred his own animated television series, &quot;The Cobi Troupe&quot;.

== Corporate image and identity ==
A renewal in Barcelona&#x27;s image and corporate identity could be seen in the publication of posters, commemorative coins, stamps minted by the FNMT in Madrid, and the Barcelona 1992 Olympic Official Commemorative Medals, designed and struck in Barcelona.

<text>The 1988 Summer Olympics (), officially the Games of the XXIV Olympiad () and officially branded as Seoul 1988 (), were an international multi-sport event held from 17 September to 2 October 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. 159 nations were represented at the games by a total of 8,391 athletes (6,197 men and 2,194 women). 237 events were held and 27,221 volunteers helped to prepare the Olympics.

The 1988 Seoul Olympics were the second summer Olympic Games held in Asia, after Tokyo 1964, and the first held in South Korea. As the host country, South Korea ranked fourth overall, winning 12 gold medals and 33 medals in the competition. 11,331 media (4,978 written press and 6,353 broadcasters) showed the Games all over the world. These were the last Olympic Games of the Cold War, as well as for the Soviet Union and East Germany, as both ceased to exist before the next Olympic Games in 1992. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count, winning 55 gold and 132 total medals. The results that got closest to that medal haul in the years since are China&#x27;s and the United States&#x27;s 48 gold medals in 2008 and 2012, respectively, and the United States&#x27;s 126 total medals in 2024.

Compared to the 1980 Summer Olympics (Moscow) and the 1984 Summer Olympics (Los Angeles), which were divided into two camps by ideology, the 1988 Seoul Olympics was a competition in which the boycotts virtually disappeared, although they were not completely over. North Korea boycotted the 1988 Seoul Olympics, as did five socialist countries including Cuba, an ally of North Korea. Albania, Ethiopia, and Seychelles did not respond to the invitation sent by the IOC. Nicaragua did not participate due to athletic and financial considerations, while the expected participation of Madagascar was withdrawn for financial reasons. Nonetheless, the much larger boycotts seen in the three previous editions were avoided, resulting in the largest number of participating nations during the Cold War era.

For South Korea, the 1988 Olympics was a symbolic event that elevated its international image while also contributing to national pride. Only thirty-five years after the Korean War which devastated the nation, and during a decade of social unrest in South Korea, the Olympics was successfully held and became the culmination of what was deemed the &quot;Miracle on the Han River&quot;.

==Host city selection==
Seoul was chosen to host the Summer Games through a vote held on 30 September 1981, finishing ahead of Nagoya, Japan. The awarding to Seoul was internationally considered to be surprising, with Nagoya having been considered a favourite. Below was the vote count that occurred at the 84th IOC Session and 11th Olympic Congress in Baden-Baden, West Germany.

Seoul had previously hosted many international events, but the most noteworthy ones were the Miss Universe 1980 and the 1986 Asian Games, thus demonstrating that it had the appropriate capability.

==Highlights==
* Soviet Vladimir Artemov won four gold medals in gymnastics. Daniela Silivaş of Romania won three and equalled compatriot Nadia Comăneci&#x27;s record of seven perfect 10s in one Olympic Games.
* After having demolished the world record in the 100-metre dash at the US Olympic trials in Indianapolis, sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner set an Olympic record (10.62) in the 100-metre dash and a still-standing world record (21.34) in the 200-metre dash to capture gold medals in both events. To these medals, she added a gold in the 4×100 relay and a silver in the 4×400.
* This was the first Olympic Games where women&#x27;s sailing was its own event. It was won by Americans Allison Jolly and Lynne Jewell.
* Canadian Ben Johnson won the 100-metre final with a world-record time of 9.79 seconds, but was disqualified after he tested positive for stanozolol. Johnson has since claimed that his positive test was the result of sabotage.
* In the women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics team all-around competition, the United States women&#x27;s team was penalized five-tenths of a point from their team score by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) after the compulsory round. East German judge Ellen Berger noticed that Rhonda Faehn, who was the American team alternate and not competing, had been standing on the uneven bars podium for the duration of Kelly Garrison-Steve&#x27;s compulsory uneven bars routine. Although Faehn was not a coach, Berger assessed the penalty under a rule prohibiting coaches from remaining on the podium while an athlete competes. The deduction caused the United States to fall to fourth place with a combined score of 390.575, three-tenths of a point behind East Germany. This incident remains controversial in the sport of gymnastics, as the United States outperformed the East German team and would have taken the bronze medal in the team competition had they not been penalized.
* Phoebe Mills won an individual bronze medal on the balance beam, shared with Romania&#x27;s Gabriela Potorac, making history as the first medal (team or individual) ever won by a US woman in artistic gymnastics at a fully attended games.
*The USSR won their final team gold medals in artistic gymnastics on both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sides with scores of 593.350 and 395.475 respectively. The men&#x27;s team was led by Vladimir Artemov, while Elena Shushunova led the women&#x27;s team.
* Lawrence Lemieux, a Canadian sailor in the Finn class, was in second place and poised to win a silver medal when he abandoned the race to save an injured competitor in mortal peril. He finished in 21st place, but was recognized by the International Fair Play Committee with the Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy honoring his bravery and sacrifice.
* American diver Greg Louganis won back-to-back titles on both diving events despite striking his head on the springboard during his third-round dive and suffering a concussion.
* Christa Luding-Rothenburger of East Germany won the silver medal in the women&#x27;s sprint event in cycling. Combined with the two medals she won in speed skating in the Winter Games in Calgary, she became the first athlete to win medals in two Olympics held in the same year; this feat is no longer possible due to the current scheduling of the Olympic Games.
* Anthony Nesty of Suriname won his country&#x27;s first Olympic medal by winning the men&#x27;s 100-metre butterfly, prevailing over American Matt Biondi by .01 of a second (thwarting Biondi&#x27;s attempt to match Mark Spitz&#x27;s record seven golds in one Olympics). Nesty was the first black person to win an individual swimming gold.
* Swimmer Kristin Otto of East Germany won six gold medals. Other multi-gold medalists in the pool were Matt Biondi (five) and Janet Evans (three).
* Swedish fencer Kerstin Palm became the first woman to take part in seven Olympics.
* Mark Todd of New Zealand won his second consecutive individual gold medal in the three-day event in equestrian on Charisma, only the second time in eventing history that a gold medal has been won consecutively.
* Baseball and Taekwondo were demonstration sports. The opening ceremony featured a mass demonstration of taekwondo with hundreds of adults and children performing moves in unison.
* This was the last time the United States was represented by an all-amateur basketball team that did not feature NBA players; the team won the bronze medal after losing to the Soviet Union (that was represented by veteran professionals) which went on to win the gold medal.
* For the first time in history, all the dressage events were won by women.
* Women&#x27;s judo was held for the first time, as a demonstration sport.
* Bowling was held as a demonstration sport, with Kwon Jong Yul of South Korea and Arianne Cerdeña from the Philippines winning the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gold medals, respectively.
* Table tennis was introduced at the Olympics, with China and South Korea both winning two titles.
* Tennis returned to the Olympics after a 64-year absence. Steffi Graf of West Germany added to her four Grand Slam victories in the year by also winning the Olympic title in women&#x27;s singles, beating Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina in the final. Graf became the first person to win all four Grand Slams and the Olympic gold in a calendar year, known as the golden slam.
* Two Bulgarian weightlifters were stripped of their gold medals after failing doping tests, and the team withdrew after this event.
* In boxing, Roy Jones Jr. of the United States dominated his opponents, never losing a single round en route to the final. In the final, he controversially lost a 3–2 decision to South Korean fighter Park Si-Hun despite pummeling Park for three rounds and landing 86 punches to Park&#x27;s 32.
* In another boxing controversy, Riddick Bowe of the United States lost a controversial match in the final to Canadian future world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis. Bowe had a dominant first round, landing 33 of 94 punches thrown (34%) while Lewis landed 14 of 67 (21%). In the first round the referee from East Germany gave Bowe two cautions for headbutts and deducted a point for a third headbutt, although replay clearly showed there was none. Commentator Ferdie Pacheco disagreed with the deduction, saying they did not hit heads. In the second round, Lewis landed several hard punches. The referee gave Bowe two standing eight counts and waved the fight off after the second one, even though Bowe seemed able to continue. Pacheco disagreed with the stoppage, calling it &quot;very strange&quot;.
* Soviet weightlifter Yury Zakharevich won the men&#x27;s heavyweight (up to 110 kg class) with a snatch and clean and jerk for a total. Zakhareivich had dislocated his elbow in 1983 attempting a world record and had it rebuilt with synthetic tendons.
* Indonesia gained its first medal in Olympic history when the women&#x27;s team won a silver medal in archery.

==Ceremonies==
Live doves were released during the opening ceremony as a symbol of world peace, but a number of the doves were burned alive or suffered major trauma by the lighting of the Olympic cauldron. As a result of protests following the incident, the last time live doves were released during the opening ceremony was in 1992 in Barcelona, at the start of the ceremony. Balloon doves were released in 1994 Winter Olympics and the 1998 Winter Olympics and paper doves were used at the Atlanta Ceremony in 1996.

These were also the last Summer Olympic Games to hold the opening ceremony during the daytime. The opening ceremony featured a skydiving team descending over the stadium and forming the five-colored Olympic Rings, as well as a mass demonstration of taekwondo. The skydiving team trained at SkyDance SkyDiving and had hoped the opening ceremony appearance would set the stage for skydiving becoming a medal event by 2000.

==Domestic historical significance==

The idea for South Korea to place a bid for the 1988 Games emerged during the last days of the Park Chung Hee administration in the late 1970s, as hosting the Olympics was a big opportunity to bring international attention to South Korea. But before that, it was necessary to prove the country&#x27;s capacity, as South Korea was seen as an exotic and risky destination for large events. The project continued to run even after President Park&#x27;s assassination in 1979. 
With the successful staging of Miss Universe 1980 and the 1986 Asian Games, Chun Doo-hwan, Park&#x27;s successor, submitted Korea&#x27;s bid to the IOC in September 1981, in hopes that the increased international exposure brought by the Olympics would legitimize his authoritarian regime amidst increasing political pressure for democratization and less rigidity in state policies. Further, he hoped it would provide protection from increasing threats from North Korea, and showcase the economic strength that the country was experiencing to the world. Seoul was awarded the bid on 30 September 1981, becoming the 16th nation in the Summer Olympics, as well as the second Asian nation (following Japan in the 1964 Summer Olympics) and the first mainland Asian nation to host the Olympics.

Influenced by the model of 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, which served as a rite of passage for the Japanese economy and re-integration of Japan in the international community in the post-war era, the South Korean government hoped to use the Olympics as a &quot;coming-out party&quot;. The Olympics gave a powerful impetus to the development of South Korea&#x27;s relations with Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and with China. In January 1982, South Korea&#x27;s curfew that had been in place since 1945 was lifted.

In utilizing media events theory, Larson and Park investigated the Seoul Olympics as a form of political communication. They revealed the significance of South Korea&#x27;s military government throughout the period of the Olympic bid and preparation, followed by the many advantages of the hosting the Games: rapid economic modernization, social mobilization and the legitimization of the military dictatorship.

==Homeless camp expansion==
Existing camps for &quot;vagrants&quot; (homeless persons) were ramped up before the 1988 Olympics. An Associated Press article states that homeless people and alcoholics, &quot;but mostly children and the disabled&quot; were arrested and sent to these camps to prepare for the Olympics. In addition, a prosecutor had his investigation into the Brothers Home camp limited at a number of levels of government &quot;in part out of fear of an embarrassing international incident on the eve of the Olympics.&quot;

In 1975, the previous president of South Korea had begun a policy of rounding up vagrants. According to government documents obtained by the Associated Press, from 1981 to 1986 the number of people held increased from 8,600 to more than 16,000. Police officers often received promotions based on the number of vagrants they had arrested, and owners of facilities received a subsidy based on the number of people held. There were multiple reports of inmates raped or beaten, and sometimes beaten to death.

4,000 of these &quot;vagrants&quot; were held at the Brothers Home facility. Many of the guards were former inmates who had been &quot;promoted&quot; because of loyalty to the camp&#x27;s owner. Various money-making operations were conducted such as manufacturing ball-point pens and fishing hooks, as well as clothing for Daewoo. Only a few inmates were paid belatedly for this work.

By accident while on a hunting trip, prosecutor Kim Yong-won heard about and visited a work detail of prisoners in ragged clothes overseen by guards with wooden bats and dogs. In his words, he knew immediately that &quot;a very serious crime&quot; was occurring, and in January 1987, he led a raid on the facility and found beaten and malnourished inmates. He was politically pressured at various levels to reduce the charges against the owner, managers, and guards. In the end, the owner only served years in prison.

The Brothers Home was a religious facility based on the Christian faith. There were in fact inspections by both city officials and church officials. However, these were scheduled inspections in which healthier inmates were presented in carefully planned and orchestrated circumstances. There were no unannounced inspections.

In the 1990s, construction workers found about 100 human bones on a mountainside outside the location of the former Brothers Home. Victims of the Brothers Home are seeking a government investigation into the crimes committed and accountability.

==Boycott==
In preparation for the 1988 Olympics, the International Olympic Committee worked to prevent another Olympic boycott by the Eastern Bloc as had happened at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. This was made more difficult by the lack of diplomatic relations between South Korea and communist countries. This prompted action by the IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, who was committed to the participation of these countries. Thus, at the Assembly of National Olympic Committees in Mexico City in November 1984, the &quot;Mexico Declaration&quot; was adopted. The declaration offered support for participation in the 1988 Olympics by all members of the Association of National Olympic Committees. The agreement with the Soviet Union was reached in 1987. After the Los Angeles games, East Germany had already decided to participate again in Seoul. The IOC also decided that it would send invitations to the 1988 Games itself and did not leave this task to the organizing committee as had been done before. Despite these developments, behind the scenes, the IOC did consider relocating the Games and explored the suitability of Munich as an alternative.

Another point of conflict was the involvement of North Korea in hosting the Games, something that had been encouraged by Cuban president Fidel Castro, who called for North Korea to be considered joint host of the Games. As a result, on 8 and 9 January 1986 in Lausanne, Switzerland, the IOC President chaired a meeting of the North and South Korean Olympic Committees. North Korea demanded that eleven of the 23 Olympic sports be carried out on its territory, and also demanded special opening and closing ceremonies. It wanted a joint organizing committee and a united team. The negotiations were continued into another meeting, but were not successful. The IOC did not meet the demands of North Korea and only about half of the desired sporting events were offered to the North. So the focus thereafter was solely on Seoul and South Korea.

The games were boycotted by North Korea and its ally Cuba. Ethiopia, Albania and the Seychelles did not respond to the invitations sent by the IOC. Nicaragua did not participate due to athletic and financial considerations. Madagascar had been expected to participate before withdrawing for financial reasons.

==Official theme song==
In 1988, the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee (SLOOC) produced and distributed an official song of the Seoul Games to publicize the Games to all the IOC member nations, encouraging their participation in the festival and
consolidating the harmony and friendship of the entire world citizens through the song. The song &quot;Hand in Hand&quot; was written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder and American songwriter Tom Whitlock, and performed by singing group Koreana.

==Mascot==

The official mascot for the 1988 Summer Olympic Games was Hodori. It was a stylized tiger designed by Kim Hyun as an amicable Amur tiger, portraying the friendly and hospitable traditions of the Korean people. Hodori&#x27;s female version was called Hosuni.

The name &quot;Hodori&quot; was chosen from 2,295 suggestions sent in by the public. It is a compound of &quot;ho&quot;, the Sino-Korean bound morpheme for &quot;tiger&quot; (appearing also in the usual word &quot;horangi&quot; for &quot;tiger&quot;), and &quot;dori&quot;, a diminutive for &quot;boys&quot;.

==Broadcasting==

In the United States, NBC became the telecast provider hereafter for the Summer Games, after a five-Olympics run by the American Broadcasting Company from 1968 to 1984.

NBC&#x27;s coverage was their first sporting event to feature the new Quantel Cypher to generate the on-screen graphics. However, the network would continue to use Chyron Corporation for the rest of the year with Quantel being used again for the 1988 World Series. The Cypher would be implemented permanently starting with Super Bowl XXIII in January 1989.

==Doping==
In 2003, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee&#x27;s director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, released documents that showed Carl Lewis had tested positive three times at the 1988 United States Olympic trials for minimum amounts of pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine, which were banned stimulants. Bronchodilators are also found in cold medication. Due to the rules, his case could have led to disqualification from the Seoul Olympics and suspension from competition for six months. The levels of the combined stimulants registered in the separate tests were 2 ppm, 4 ppm and 6 ppm. Lewis defended himself, claiming that he had accidentally consumed the banned substances. After the supplements that he had taken were analyzed to prove his claims, the USOC accepted his claim of inadvertent use, since a dietary supplement he ingested was found to contain &quot;Ma huang&quot;, the Chinese name for Ephedra (ephedrine is known to help weight loss). Fellow Santa Monica Track Club teammates Joe DeLoach and Floyd Heard were also found to have the same banned stimulants in their systems, and were cleared to compete for the same reason. The highest level of the stimulants Lewis recorded was 6 ppm, which was regarded as a positive test in 1988 but is now regarded as negative test. The acceptable level has been raised to ten parts per million for ephedrine and twenty-five parts per million for other substances. According to the IOC rules at the time, positive tests with levels lower than 10 ppm were cause of further investigation but not immediate ban. Neal Benowitz, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who is an expert on ephedrine and other stimulants, agreed that &quot;These [levels] are what you&#x27;d see from someone taking cold or allergy medicines and are unlikely to have any effect on performance.&quot; Following Exum&#x27;s revelations the IAAF acknowledged that at the 1988 Olympic Trials the USOC indeed followed the correct procedures in dealing with eight positive findings for ephedrine and ephedrine-related compounds in low concentration. Additionally, in 1988 the federation reviewed the relevant documents with the athletes&#x27; names undisclosed and stated that &quot;the medical committee felt satisfied, however, on the basis of the information received that the cases had been properly concluded by the USOC as &#x27;negative cases&#x27; in accordance with the rules and regulations in place at the time and no further action was taken&quot;.

<doc id="82759" wikidata="Q7987828" url="?curid=82759" title="Western European Summer Time">
<text>Western European Summer Time (WEST, UTC+01:00) is a summer daylight saving time scheme, 1 hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time and Coordinated Universal Time. It is used in:
* the Canary Islands
* Portugal (including Madeira but not the Azores)
* the Faroe Islands

The following countries also use the same time zone for their daylight saving time but use a different title:
*United Kingdom, which uses British Summer Time (BST) 
*Ireland, which uses Irish Standard Time (IST) ( (ACÉ)). Also sometimes erroneously referred to as &quot;Irish Summer Time&quot; ().

The scheme runs from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October each year. At both the start and end of the schemes, clock changes take place at 01:00 UTC+00:00. During the winter, Western European Time (WET, GMT+0 or UTC+00:00) is used.

The start and end dates of the scheme are asymmetrical in terms of daylight hours: the vernal time of year with a similar amount of daylight to late October is mid-February, well before the start of summer time. The asymmetry reflects temperature more than the length of daylight.

Ireland observes Irish Standard Time during the summer months and changes to UTC+00:00 in winter. As Ireland&#x27;s winter time period begins on the last Sunday in October and finishes on the last Sunday in March, the result is the same as if it observed summer time.

==Usage==
The following countries and territories use UTC+01:00 during the summer, between 1:00 UTC on the last Sunday of March and 1:00 UTC on the last Sunday of October.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, since the Standard Time (Amendment) Act, 1971, Ireland has used UTC+1 in summer (officially &quot;standard time&quot;, , though usually called &quot;summer time&quot;) and UTC+0 in winter (officially &quot;winter time&quot;).

===Portugal===

Portugal moved to Central European Time and Central European Summer Time in 1992, but reverted to Western European Time in 1996 after concluding that energy savings were small, it had a disturbing effect on children&#x27;s sleeping habits as it would not get dark until 22:00 or 22:30 in summer evenings, during winter mornings the sun was still rising at 9:00, with repercussions on standards of learning and school performance, and insurance companies reported a rise in the number of accidents.

===United Kingdom===
Starting in 1916, the dates for the beginning and end of BST each year were mandated by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. From 1940 to 1945, the country used British Summer Time in the winter months and British Double Summer Time, a further hour ahead of GMT, in the summer months. From 1968 to 1971, the country used BST throughout the year. In February 2002, the Summer Time Order 2002 changed the dates and times to match European rules for moving to and from daylight saving time.

== Start and end dates of British Summer Time and Irish Standard Time==
Note: Until 1 October 1916 time in all of Ireland was based on Dublin Mean Time, GMT − 25 minutes.

<text>FLOW-MATIC, originally known as B-0 (Business Language version 0), was the first English-like data processing language. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand under Grace Hopper from 1955 to 1959, and helped shape the development of COBOL.

== Development ==
Hopper had found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation:
 In late 1953, she proposed that data processing problems should be expressed using English keywords, but Rand management considered the idea unfeasible. In early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for such a programming language and implemented a prototype. The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.

== Innovations and influence ==
The Laning and Zierler system was the first programming language to parse algebraic formulae. When Hopper became aware of that language in 1954, it altered the trajectory of her work. FLOW-MATIC was the first programming language to express operations using English-like statements. It was also the first system to distinctly separate the description of data from the operations on it. Its data definition language, unlike its executable statements, was not English-like; rather, data structures were defined by filling in pre-printed forms.

FLOW-MATIC and its direct descendant AIMACO shaped COBOL, which incorporated several of its elements:

* Defining Input &amp; Output Files and printed output in advance, separated into INPUT files, OUTPUT files and (HSP) High Speed Printer outputs. ; ; .
* Qualification of data-names ( or clause).
* clause on file operations.
* Figurative constant (originally , where number of s indicated precision).
* Dividing the program into sections, separating different parts of the program. Flow-Matic sections included &#x27; (Environment Division), &#x27; (Data Division), and (Procedure Division).

== Sample program ==
A sample FLOW-MATIC program:
 () INPUT INVENTORY FILE-A PRICE FILE-B ; OUTPUT PRICED-INV FILE-C UNPRICED-INV
 FILE-D ; HSP D .
 () COMPARE PRODUCT-NO (A) WITH PRODUCT-NO (B) ; IF GREATER GO TO OPERATION 10 ;
 IF EQUAL GO TO OPERATION 5 ; OTHERWISE GO TO OPERATION 2 .
 () TRANSFER A TO D .
 () WRITE-ITEM D .
 () JUMP TO OPERATION 8 .
 () TRANSFER A TO C .
 () MOVE UNIT-PRICE (B) TO UNIT-PRICE (C) .
 () WRITE-ITEM C .
 () READ-ITEM A ; IF END OF DATA GO TO OPERATION 14 .
 () JUMP TO OPERATION 1 .
 () READ-ITEM B ; IF END OF DATA GO TO OPERATION 12 .
 () JUMP TO OPERATION 1 .
 () SET OPERATION 9 TO GO TO OPERATION 2 .
 () JUMP TO OPERATION 2 .
 () TEST PRODUCT-NO (B) AGAINST ; IF EQUAL GO TO OPERATION 16 ;
 OTHERWISE GO TO OPERATION 15 .
 () REWIND B .
 () CLOSE-OUT FILES C ; D .
 () STOP . (END)

Sample Notes
# Note that this sample includes only the executable statements of the program, the section. The record fields and would have been defined in the section, which (as previously noted) did not use English-like syntax.
# Files are referred to by the letter at the end of the FILE-LETTER. Example: FILE-A is referred to later just by A and is for ease of reference in following code. 
# Operations are numbered in an unbroken sequence from 0..n and are performed in that order unless a statement to the contrary is reached/made (executed) (JUMP, etc.).
# The highest numbered operation is the one that stops the program.
# A much more detailed overview of FLOW-MATIC is available in the manual titled, FLOW-MATIC PROGRAMMING SYSTEM

<text>The 1984 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the XXIII Olympiad and commonly known as Los Angeles 1984) were an international multi-sport event held from July 28 to August 12, 1984, in Los Angeles, California, United States. It marked the second time that Los Angeles had hosted the Games, the first being in 1932. This was the first of two consecutive Olympic Games to be held in North America with Calgary, Alberta, Canada hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics. California was the home state of the incumbent U.S. president Ronald Reagan, who officially opened the Games. These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch.

The 1984 Games were boycotted by fourteen Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union and East Germany, in response to the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia, in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan; Romania was the only Soviet-aligned state that opted to attend the Games. Albania, Iran and Libya also chose to boycott the Games, but for unrelated reasons.

Despite the field being depleted in certain sports due to the boycott, 140 National Olympic Committees took part in the 1984 Games, a record number at the time. The United States won the most gold and overall medals, followed by Romania and West Germany.

The 1984 Summer Olympics are widely considered to be the most financially successful modern Olympics, serving as an example on how to run an Olympic Games. As a result of low construction costs, due to the use of existing sport infrastructure, coupled with a reliance on private corporate the 1984 Games generated a profit of over .

On July 18, 2009, a 25th anniversary celebration of the 1984 Games was held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The celebration included a speech by former Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee president Peter Ueberroth, a short re-enactment of the Flying Rocketman sequence, the presentation of more than 35 (mostly So-Cal-based) gold medal winners from 1984 (which was part of Ceremonies producer David Wolper&#x27;s original 1984 plans) as well as a re-lighting of the Olympic cauldron.

Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics for the third time in 2028.

==Host selection==
After the terrorist attack at the 1972 Summer Olympics, the significant financial debts of Montreal (1976), and various boycotts by National Olympic Committees, few cities by the late 1970s were willing to bid for the Summer Olympics. Only two cities (Tehran and Los Angeles) made serious bids for the 1984 Summer Games, but before the final selection of a winning city in 1978, the bid from Tehran was withdrawn in June 1975. Hence, the selection process for the 1984 Summer Olympics consisted of a single finalized bid from Los Angeles, which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) accepted. The selection was officially made at the 80th IOC Session in Athens on May 18, 1978.

Los Angeles had unsuccessfully bid for the two previous Summer Olympic Games (1976 and 1980, which went to Montreal and Moscow, respectively). The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) had submitted at least one bid for every Olympics since 1944 but had not succeeded since the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932, the previous time only a single bid had been issued for the Summer Olympics.

==Torch relay==

The 1984 Olympic Torch Relay began in New York City and ended in Los Angeles, traversing 33 states and the District of Columbia. Unlike later torch relays, the torch was continuously carried by runners on foot. The route covered more than 9,320 mi (15,000 km) and involved 3,636 runners. Noted athlete O. J. Simpson was among the runners, carrying the torch up the California Incline in Santa Monica. Gina Hemphill, a granddaughter of Jesse Owens, carried the torch into the Coliseum, completed a lap around the track, then handed it off to the final runner, Rafer Johnson, winner of the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics. With the torch, he touched off the flame which passed through a specially designed flammable Olympic logo, igniting all five rings. Johnson became the first person of African descent to light the cauldron in Olympic history. The flame then passed up to the cauldron atop the peristyle and remained aflame for the duration of the Games.
==Music==

John Williams composed the theme for the Olympiad, &quot;Los Angeles Olympic Theme&quot; later also known as &quot;Olympic Fanfare and Theme&quot;. This piece won a Grammy for Williams and became one of the most well-known musical themes of the Olympic Games, along with Leo Arnaud&#x27;s &quot;Bugler&#x27;s Dream&quot;; the latter is sometimes attached to the beginning of Olympic Fanfare and Theme. Composer Bill Conti also wrote a song to inspire the weightlifters called &quot;Power&quot;. An album, &quot;The Official Music of the XXIII Olympiad—Los Angeles 1984&quot;, featured those three tracks along with sports themes written for the occasion by popular musical artists including Foreigner, Toto, Loverboy, Herbie Hancock, Quincy Jones, Christopher Cross, Philip Glass, Paul Engemann and Giorgio Moroder. &quot;Reach Out&quot; was the main soundtrack and is the official theme song of the 1984 Summer Olympics.

The Brazilian composer Sérgio Mendes also produced a special song for the 1984 Olympic Games, &quot;Olympia,&quot; from his 1984 album &quot;Confetti&quot;. A choir of approximately one thousand voices was assembled of singers in the region. All were volunteers from nearby churches, schools and universities.

Etta James performed &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot; at the Opening Ceremony.

Vicki McClure, along with the International Children&#x27;s Choir of Long Beach, sang &quot;Reach Out and Touch&quot;.

Alongside Williams and the house orchestra, 84 pianists performed an abridged version of George Gershwin&#x27;s composition &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;.

Lionel Richie performed a special extended 9-minute version of his hit single &quot;All Night Long&quot; at the closing ceremonies.

==Mascot==

The mascot was a bald eagle named Sam the Olympic Eagle.

==Highlights==
===Arts Festival===
The 1984 Summer Olympics was preceded by the 10-week-long adjunct Los Angeles Olympic Arts Festival, which opened on June 2 and ended on August 12. It provided more than 400 performances by 146 theater, dance and music companies, representing every continent and 18 countries. It was organized by then-CalArts President Robert Fitzpatrick.

===General===
* This was the first edition in which new rules of coexistence within the Olympic Village were implemented and it was decided that from this edition onwards all athletes would have to stay in the same place, as opposed to being divided by gender and sometimes even political blocs which was the case previously.
* Also for the first time in history, the International Olympic Committee authorized the formal segments of the opening ceremony to be interspersed with the cultural segments. The start of the event featured the arrival of Bill Suitor by means of the Bell Aerosystems rocket pack (also known as a Jet Pack).
* The United States topped the medal count for the first time since 1968, winning a record 83 gold medals and surpassing the Soviet Union&#x27;s total of 81 golds at the 1980 Summer Olympics.
* As a result of an Nagoya Resolution signed in 1979,and the designating the Republic of China (Taiwan) as Chinese Taipei, the People&#x27;s Republic of China returned to the Summer Olympics for the first time since Helsinki 1952. The Military anthem of China was played for both teams during the opening ceremony.
* Local Los Angeles artist Rodolfo Escalera was commissioned to create nine paintings depicting the Summer Games that would later be turned into collectible plates and presented as &quot;The Official Gift of the 1984 Olympics&quot;.LAOOC also designed Ernie Barnes as &quot;Sports Artist of the 1984 Summer Olympic Games&quot; and Barnes was commissioned to create five Olympic-themed paintings and serve as an official Olympic spokesman to encourage inner-city youth.

===Track and field===
* Carl Lewis of the United States, making his first of four appearances at the Olympics, equaled the 1936 performance of Jesse Owens by winning four gold medals, in the 100 m, 200 m, 4 × 100 m relay and long jump.
* Edwin Moses of the United States won the gold medal in the 400m hurdles 8 years after winning in 1976.
* Joaquim Cruz of Brazil won the 800 meter run with a time of 1:43.00 to set an Olympic record.
* Nawal El Moutawakel of Morocco became the first female Olympic champion of a Muslim nation—and the first of her country—in the 400 m hurdles.
* Carlos Lopes, from Portugal, won the Marathon at the age of 37, with a time of 2:09:21, an Olympic record that stood for 24 years. It was the first gold medal ever for Portugal. Gold medal favorite, World Record holder and the then World Champion, Robert de Castella from Australia, finished in 5th place, 1:48 behind Lopes.
* A marathon for women was held for the first time at the Olympics (won by Joan Benoit of the U.S.). The event was also remembered for Swiss runner Gabriela Andersen-Schiess, who – suffering from heat exhaustion – entered the stadium for the final lap in a state of almost total exhaustion, barely able to walk but eventually completing the race, collapsing at the finishing line and being immediately treated by medical personnel.
* Daley Thompson of Great Britain apparently missed a new world record in winning his second consecutive gold medal in the decathlon; the next year, his score was retroactively raised to 8847, giving him the record.
* Sebastian Coe of Great Britain became the first man to win consecutive gold medals in the 1500m.
* Maricica Puică of Romania won the 3000 meters, known for the Mary Decker vs. Zola Budd rivalry. World champion and heavy favorite Decker fell after a controversial collision with Budd. However, Puică had the best annual time at the distance, easily run away from silver medalist Wendy Sly of Great Britain and appeared to have more to give if it had been necessary. Puică was injured during the very first Track and Field World Championships in Helsinki the year before, in which Decker had won both the 1500 meters and the 3000 meters.

===Other sports===
* The first gold medal to be awarded at the Los Angeles Olympics was also the first-ever medal to be won by an athlete from China when Xu Haifeng won the 50 m Pistol event.
* Archer Neroli Fairhall from New Zealand was the first paraplegic Olympian at any Olympic Games, coming 35th in the Women&#x27;s individual event.
* Synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics debuted in Los Angeles as Olympic events, as did wind surfing.
* Li Ning from the People&#x27;s Republic of China won 6 medals in gymnastics, 3 gold, 2 silver, and 1 bronze, earning him the nickname &quot;Prince of Gymnasts&quot; in China. Li would later light the Olympic Cauldron at the 2008 Olympics.
* Steve Redgrave of Great Britain won his first title in rowing of the record five he would go on to win in five Olympic competitions.
* Victor Davis of Canada set a new world record in winning the gold medal in the 200-meter breaststroke in swimming.
* Mary Lou Retton of the United States became the first gymnast outside Eastern Europe to win the gymnastics all-around competition.
* In men&#x27;s gymnastics, the American team won the gold medal.
* France won the Olympic association football (soccer) tournament, defeating Brazil 2–0 in the final. Olympic football was unexpectedly played before massive crowds throughout America, with several sell-outs at the 100,000+ seat Rose Bowl. This interest eventually led to the U.S. hosting the 1994 FIFA World Cup.
* The Soviet-led boycott affected weightlifting more than any other sport: 94 of the world&#x27;s top 100 ranked lifters were absent, as were 29 of the 30 medalists from the recent world championships. All 10 of the defending world champions in the 10 weight categories were absent. The success of the Eastern Bloc countries might be explained by state-run doping programs that had been developed there.
* Future Dream Team members Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, and Chris Mullin were on the team that won the gold medal in basketball. The 1984 U.S. men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team was coached by Indiana Hoosiers head coach Bobby Knight.
* Connie Carpenter-Phinney of the United States became the first woman to win an Olympic cycling event when she won the women&#x27;s individual road race.
* In the judo open division, four-time world champion Yasuhiro Yamashita of Japan tore a right calf muscle in the preliminary match against Arthur Schnabel. This put Yamashita at a huge disadvantage since he executed his throws by pivoting on his right leg. Though he managed to win the match with an Okuri-Eri-Jime, the injury caused him to visibly limp during the semi-final match against Laurent Del Colombo. Yamashita was thrown with an Osoto Gari only 30 seconds into the match, but managed to return an Osoto Gari and won the match with a Yoko-Shiho-Gatame (side four-quarter hold). He played the final match against Mohamed Ali Rashwan of Egypt. Yamashita won the final and the gold medal despite his injury. The match witnessed a remarkable fair play act from Rashwan who did not aim for Yamashita&#x27;s right leg. Rashwan was even given an award from the International Fairplay Committee.

==Medal count==

These are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1984 Games.
==Participating National Olympic Committees==
Athletes from 140 states competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Eighteen states made their Olympic debut: Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, British Virgin Islands, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, The Gambia, Grenada, Mauritania, Mauritius, North Yemen, Oman, Qatar, Rwanda, Western Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and the United Arab Emirates. Zaire had previously competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics as &quot;Congo-Kinshasa&quot;. The People&#x27;s Republic of China made its first appearance in a Summer Olympics since 1952, while for the first time the Republic of China team participated under the politically contrived name of &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;.

The Soviet Union led the Warsaw Pact members and other Communist countries in a boycott of the Los Angeles Olympics, in retaliation for the U.S.-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics four years earlier (over the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Afghanistan in 1979). The pretexts for the 1984 Soviet-led boycott were concerns over security, &quot;chauvinistic sentiments&quot; and &quot;an anti-Soviet hysteria ... being whipped up&quot; in the United States. However, a handful of communist countries disregarded the boycott and attended the Games anyway, among them Yugoslavia (host of the 1984 Winter Olympics), the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and Romania (the only Warsaw Pact country that had opted to ignore the Soviet demands). The Romanian team received a particularly warm reception from the United States; when the Romanian athletes entered during the opening ceremonies, they were greeted by a standing ovation from the spectators, who were mostly U.S. citizens. This would turn out to be Romania&#x27;s most successful Olympic Games – they won 53 medals, including 20 golds.

In the table below, the number of athletes representing each state is shown in parentheses.

=== Number of athletes by National Olympic Committees ===

==Boycotting countries==


Fifteen countries took part in the Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Olympics:
* Afghanistan
* Angola
* Bulgaria
* Cuba
* Czechoslovakia
* East Germany
* Ethiopia
* Hungary
* Laos
* Mongolia
* North Korea
* Poland
* Soviet Union
* South Yemen
* Vietnam

Albania, Iran, Libya and Upper Volta (changed to Burkina Faso following August 4) also missed the Los Angeles Olympics, citing political reasons, but these countries were not a part of the Soviet-led boycott. Albania and Iran were the only two countries to boycott both the 1980 and 1984 Summer Games.

* Iran
* Libya

===Soviet doping plan===
Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union&#x27;s plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country&#x27;s decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union&#x27;s head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics. Filmmaker and director of 2017 movie &quot;Icarus&quot; Bryan Fogel has said that stricter doping controls might have been the main reason for the Soviet boycott.

==Financial success of Los Angeles as host city==

Following the news of the massive financial losses of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, the only two cities to express a genuine interest in hosting the 1984 Games were Los Angeles and New York. Given that only one city per country is allowed to bid for any one Games, the USOC vote for the American bid city was effectively the deciding vote for the 1984 Olympics host city. In this case, the Los Angeles bid received 55 votes compared with New York&#x27;s 39 votes – this is the closest that the city of New York has ever come to being selected to host the Olympic Games, coming closer in 1984 than they did in their 2012 bid (when they lost to London).

Ambitious construction projects for the two previous Summer Olympics, Montreal 1976 and Moscow 1980, had burdened organizers with substantial debts as expenses greatly exceeded revenues. Furthermore, the 1976 and 1980 Olympics were entirely government-funded. Unlike Montreal and Moscow, Los Angeles 1984 was privately funded, with strict controls imposed on expenditure; rather than constructing new venues with overly ambitious designs, the organizers chose instead to utilize existing venues and facilities wherever possible. The main example of this was the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which was also the Olympic Stadium for the 1932 Summer Olympics. The only two new venues constructed specifically for the 1984 Summer Olympics were secured with the backing of corporate sponsors: the Olympic Velodrome was largely funded by the 7-Eleven corporation and the Olympic Swim Stadium by McDonald&#x27;s.

In addition to corporate support, the Olympic committee also used the income from the exclusive television rights, and for the first time these contracts would prove to be a significant source of revenue. Adjusted for inflation, the Los Angeles Games secured twice the amount of income received by the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics and four times that of the 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics.

The low level of interest among potential host cities for the 1984 Games had been viewed as a major threat to the future of the Olympic Games. However, after the financial success of the Los Angeles Games, cities began to show a renewed interest in bidding to become host again. The Los Angeles and Montreal Games are seen as examples of best and worst practice when organizing the Olympics and serve as valuable lessons to prospective host cities.

Following the success of the 1984 Games, the Los Angeles OCOG, led by Peter Ueberroth, used the profits to create the LA84 Foundation for promoting youth sports in Southern California, educating coaches and maintaining a sports library.

==In popular culture==
The games were the subject of the 1983–84 United States commemorative coin series.

American fast food chain McDonald&#x27;s ran a promotion titled, &quot;When the U.S. Wins, You Win&quot; where customers scratched off a ticket with the name of an Olympic event on it. If the U.S. won a medal in that event, then they would be given a free menu item: a Big Mac for a gold medal, an order of french fries for a silver medal, and a Coca-Cola for a bronze medal. The promotion became more popular than expected due to the Soviet boycott which led to the U.S. winning far more Olympic medals than expected. This promotion was parodied in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s First Word&quot;, where Krusty Burger runs a similar offer. The promotion was intended to be rigged so that prizes would only be offered in events dominated by the Eastern Bloc, but the Soviet-led boycott causes Krusty to personally lose $44 million. He vehemently promises &quot;to spit in every fiftieth burger,&quot; to which Homer retorts &quot;I like those odds!&quot; Chief Wiggum also exclaims that he could kiss Carl Lewis, who won four gold medals at the Games.

On &quot;NCIS&quot;, Tim McGee has an obsession with jet packs, stemming from having attended the 1984 Olympic ceremony as a child and having Bill Suitor fly over his head in his jet pack. This storyline is based on the real experience of executive producer and writer Jesse Stern.

Pop-punk band Bowling for Soup references the games in the song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand LA&quot;. During a section showing appreciation for the city, the song states, &quot;thank you for hair metal and the &#x27;84 Olympics.&quot;

Jilly Cooper&#x27;s novel Riders has a storyline set at the show jumping event at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Gymnast&quot;, Jerry dates a woman who competed in the 1984 Olympics and won a silver medal for Romania.

In &quot;American Horror Story: 1984&quot;, the characters watch it together on the TV in the girls cabin.

In the same week that the Games began, British pop star Howard Jones released a single called &quot;Like to Get to Know You Well&quot; which eventually made number 4 on the UK Singles Chart and number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. On the sleeve, the record was &quot;dedicated to the original spirit of the Olympic Games&quot;.

<doc id="82764" wikidata="Q3255" url="?curid=82764" title="Usedom">
<text>Usedom ( , ) is a Baltic Sea island in Pomerania, divided between Germany and Poland. It is the second largest Pomeranian island after Rügen, and the most populous island in the Baltic Sea.

It lies north of the Szczecin Lagoon estuary of the Oder river. About 80% of the island belongs to the German district of Vorpommern-Greifswald in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The eastern part and the largest city on the island, Świnoujście, are part of the Polish West Pomeranian Voivodeship. The island&#x27;s total area is – in the German part and in the Polish part. Its population is 76,500 (German part 31,500; Polish part 45,000).

With an annual average of 1,906 hours of sunshine, Usedom is the sunniest region of both Germany and Poland, and it is also one of the sunniest islands in the Baltic Sea, hence its nickname &quot;Sun Island&quot; (, ).

The island has been a tourist destination since the Gründerzeit in the 19th century, and features resort architecture. Seaside resorts include Zinnowitz and the Amber Spas in the west, the Kaiserbad and Świnoujście in the east.

== Geography ==

The island is separated from the neighbouring island of Wolin to the east by the Strait of Świna, which is the main route connecting Szczecin Bay with the Pomeranian Bay, a part of the Baltic Sea. The strait between the island and the mainland is called the Peenestrom; it is a downstream extension of the valley of the Peene river, which flows into the westernmost part of the Szczecin Lagoon. The island is mostly flat, and partly covered by marshes.

Geographical features include a number of lakes:

The largest town on the island is Świnoujście, which has a total population of 41,500. The western part of Świnoujście covers the entire Polish part of the island. Another town, Usedom, gives its name to the island. The largest municipalities in the German part are Heringsdorf (from 2005 to 2006 called &quot;Dreikaiserbäder&quot;, literally &quot;The Three Imperial Spas&quot;) and Zinnowitz.

There are many seaside resorts on the Baltic Sea coast, including Zinnowitz and Koserow in the west – and the three Imperial Spas Ahlbeck, Heringsdorf, and Bansin forming a town, as well as neighbouring Świnoujście in the east of Usedom.

The hinterland is called &quot;Achterland&quot;, referring to the Achterwasser lagoon (&quot;Rear Waters&quot;). It is characterized by unspoilt forests, lagoon landscapes, and hills, as well as calm villages such as Loddin and Balmer See with its golf course.

Main economic activities include tourism, health and life sciences, retail, agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry, food processing, and timber production.

==History==

Settled since the Stone Age, the area was probably inhabited by Germanic Rugians, before the Polabian Slavs moved in during the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries. Around the island, Wendish/Scandinavian trade centres such as Vineta/Jomsborg and Menzlin were established. In the 1110s, the town of Uznam was destroyed by the Danes. In the 1120s, the island along with Western Pomerania came under Polish suzerainty under Bolesław III Wrymouth, and became part of a newly formed vassal state of Poland, the Duchy of Pomerania. The Polish ruler initiated Christianization, entrusting this task to Otto of Bamberg, and in 1128 the Slavic Pomeranian Duke Wartislaw I was converted to Christianity through the efforts of Otto. In 1155 the Premonstratensians established a monastery in Grobe, generally known as Usedom Abbey, which in 1309 was moved to the village of Pudagla. In the meantime, a Cistercian nunnery was founded in Krummin and soon almost the whole island was in the possession of one or the other of the ecclesiastical orders. In the 1170s, the island was ravaged by King Valdemar I of Denmark. During the Reformation, ownership passed to the Slavic dukes of Pomerania, who took over the island.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, on June 26, 1630, the Swedish Army under King Gustavus Adolphus landed in the village of Peenemünde, located on the Peenestrom strait. In 1637 the last duke of Pomerania Bogislaw XIV died, the House of Griffin became extinct and the duchy ceased to exist. Usedom was annexed by Sweden after the war for almost a century, until in 1720 it was sold for 2 million thalers to Prussian King Frederick William I. In 1740 Frederick the Great of Prussia developed a seaport in Świnoujście (then &quot;Swinemünde&quot;). With the Kingdom of Prussia the island became part of the German Empire in 1871.

The small village of Peenemünde came to prominence again during World War II. The Luftwaffe tested missiles and rockets, including the V-1 and V-2 nearby. Germany used thousands of slave laborers on Usedom during World War II. During the war, a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp was located in the town of Usedom. In the final stages of the war, in 1945, German-perpetrated death marches of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B and Stalag Luft IV POW camps passed through the island.

In 1945 the eastern part of the island, together with the city and port of Swinemünde (now Świnoujście), was assigned to Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, and the surviving German inhabitants of the town were expelled to the west. The territory was repopulated with Poles, most of whom had been expelled by the Soviets from what had been eastern Poland.

==Tourism==

Usedom is one of Germany&#x27;s major holiday and recreation areas due to its beaches, its natural environment, and seaside towns such as Ahlbeck, Heringsdorf and Bansin, which, since the Gründerzeit in the 19th century, have been frequented by the German and international nobility as well as the general public.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the island, as of 2022, &quot;... is known by some as the &#x27;bathtub of Berlin&#x27; and by others, slightly more poetically, as &#x27;sun island&#x27;,&quot; but &quot;... remains largely undiscovered by international visitors.&quot;

Hotels and bed and breakfast establishments are available on both sides of the German-Polish border. Many of them are decorated in nautical themes, and seafood is a major drawcard. St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Benz is featured in the works of several artists, including the German-American painter Lyonel Feininger who spent summer vacations on the island from 1909 to 1918. In addition to the coastline, the hinterland features nature reserves, castles, lakes and historic villages.

Points of interest in the German part of the island include:

* Usedom Botanical Gardens, Mellenthin, a botanical garden
* Karnin Lift Bridge, a technical monument to the former bridge over the Peenestrom.
* Dannenfeldt Mausoleum
In the Polish part of the island, points of interest include:

* Karsiborskie Paprocie nature reserve
* Sea Fishing Museum (&quot;Muzeum Rybołówstwa Morskiego&quot;)
* Western Fort (&quot;Fort Zachodni&quot;), which houses the Museum of the History of the Świnoujście Fortress (&quot;Muzeum Historii Twierdzy Świnoujście&quot;)
* Park Zdrojowy

==Military==

The Polish Naval Base Świnoujście is located on the island.

<text>Dame Margaret Natalie Smith (28 December 1934 – 27 September 2024) was a British actress. Known for her wit in both comedic and dramatic roles, she had an extensive career on stage and screen for over seven decades and was one of Britain&#x27;s most recognisable and prolific actresses. She received numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards, four Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards and a Tony Award, as well as nominations for six Olivier Awards. Smith is one of the few performers to earn the Triple Crown of Acting.

Smith began her stage career as a student, performing at the Oxford Playhouse in 1952, and made her professional debut on Broadway in &quot;New Faces of &#x27;56&quot;. Over the following decades Smith established herself alongside Judi Dench as one of the most significant British theatre performers, working for the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. On Broadway, she received the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; (1990). She was Tony-nominated for Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1975) and Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1979).

Smith won Academy Awards for Best Actress for &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969) and Best Supporting Actress for &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978). She was Oscar-nominated for &quot;Othello&quot; (1965), &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot; (1972), &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985) and &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001). She portrayed Professor Minerva McGonagall in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series (2001–2011). She also acted in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978), &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), &quot;Sister Act&quot; (1992), &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1993), &quot;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot; (2012), &quot;Quartet&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot; (2015).

Smith received newfound attention and international fame for her role as Violet Crawley in the British period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2010–2015). The role earned her three Primetime Emmy Awards; she had previously won one for the HBO film &quot;My House in Umbria&quot; (2003). Over the course of her career she was the recipient of numerous honorary awards, including the British Film Institute Fellowship in 1993, the BAFTA Fellowship in 1996 and the Society of London Theatre Special Award in 2010. Smith was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990.

==Early life and education==
Margaret Natalie Smith was born on 28 December 1934 in Ilford, Essex. Her mother, Margaret Hutton (née Little), was a Scottish secretary from Glasgow, and her father, Nathaniel Smith, was a public-health pathologist from Newcastle upon Tyne, who worked at the University of Oxford. The family moved to Oxford when Smith was four years old. She had older twin brothers, Alistair and Ian. The latter went to architecture school. Smith was educated at Oxford High School until the age of 16, when she left to study acting at the Oxford Playhouse.

==Career==

=== 1952–1968: National Theatre ===
 In 1952, aged 17, under the auspices of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, Smith began her career as Viola in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at the Oxford Playhouse. She continued to act in productions at the Oxford Playhouse, including &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1952), &quot;Rookery Nook&quot; (1953), &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; (1954). That same year, she appeared in the television programme &quot;Oxford Accents&quot; (1954) produced by Ned Sherrin. In 1956 Smith made her Broadway debut playing several roles in the review &quot;New Faces of &#x27;56&quot;, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre from June to December 1956. In 1957 she starred opposite Kenneth Williams in the musical comedy &quot;Share My Lettuce&quot;, written by Bamber Gascoigne.

In 1962 Smith won the first of a record six Best Actress &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Awards for her roles in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s plays &quot;The Private Ear&quot; and &quot;The Public Eye&quot;, again opposite Kenneth Williams. She caught the eye of Laurence Olivier, who, after seeing her in &quot;The Double Dealer&quot; at The Old Vic, invited her to become part of his new National Theatre Company soon after it was formed at The Old Vic in 1962. Alongside Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon, she soon became a fixture at the National Theatre in the 1960s. The theatre critic Michael Coveney wrote that during her eight years in the company, Smith developed a fierce rivalry with Olivier writing, &quot;He knew immediately he&#x27;d met his match – that she was extraordinary. He said that anyone who can play comedy that well can also play tragedy and he offered her the likes of Desdemona in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. But having got her into the company they became not enemies, but professional rivals. Never before had anyone on stage been quicker than him and now, it seemed, there was a contest.&quot;
During a 1964 production of &quot;Othello&quot;, Olivier struck Smith across the face, knocking her out. She later recalled the incident on a 2015 edition of &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; and in the 2018 documentary &quot;Nothing Like a Dame&quot;. She appeared opposite Olivier as Sylvia in &quot;The Recruiting Officer&quot; in 1963–64 and again as Hilde in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Master Builder&quot; in 1964–65. Smith&#x27;s 1967 portrayal of Beatrice in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, by the director Franco Zeffirelli, is thought to be the earliest British television broadcast of the entire play. The screen version was assumed lost until a copy was discovered in the Library of Congress in Washington, DC in 2010.

Smith appeared in her first film in 1956, in an uncredited role of a party guest in the British drama &quot;Child in the House&quot;. In 1959 she received the first of her 18 British Academy Film Award nominations for her role as Bridget Howard in the film &quot;Nowhere to Go&quot;, her first screen credit. In 1963 she appeared in a supporting role as Miss Dee Mead in the British drama film &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; starring Richard Burton, Elizabeth Taylor and Orson Welles. She earned her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Desdemona in the film adaptation of &quot;Othello&quot; (1965), acting alongside Olivier, Jacobi and Gambon. During this time she also appeared in the British comedy &quot;Go to Blazes&quot; (1962), &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; (1964) and &quot;Young Cassidy&quot; (1965). She also appeared in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s crime comedy &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967) starring Rex Harrison and &quot;Hot Millions&quot; (1968) opposite Peter Ustinov. and guest-starred as Music Hall Star in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969).

=== 1969–1979: Rise to prominence and stardom ===
Smith won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the title role of the 1969 film &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;. Vanessa Redgrave had originated the role on stage in London, and Zoe Caldwell won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, when she played the role in New York City. Smith was singled out for her performance in the film. Dave Kehr of &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; said that Smith gives &quot;one of those technically stunning, emotionally distant performances that the British are so damn good at.&quot; Greg Ferrara wrote that the film &quot;is one of the best British films of the decade. It is as captivating today as it was upon its release and its two central performances by Maggie Smith and Pamela Franklin are both stirring and mesmerizing. &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; is the crème de la crème.&quot; The role also won Smith her first BAFTA Film Award for Best Actress.

In 1970 Smith played the title role in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s London production of the Henrik Ibsen play &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, winning her second &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for Best Actress. In 1975 Smith starred as Amanda Prynne in the Noël Coward comedy &quot;Private Lives&quot; at the 46th Street Theatre on Broadway. The play, directed by John Gielgud, received positive reviews. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theatre critic praised Smith&#x27;s physical comedic skills writing, &quot;Miss Smith&#x27;s body spins, lurches, misses yards at a time before another foot comes down, ends in a paralysis that will require hypnosis to undo. The effect, because Noel Coward&#x27;s situation is funny and because Miss Smith sends off that one little extra signal that spells extravagance, is hilarious, explosively so.&quot; Smith received her first Tony Award nomination and a Drama Desk Award nomination. In the mid-1970s, she made several guest appearances on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.

In 1972 Smith starred as the eccentric Augusta Bertram in George Cukor&#x27;s film &quot;Travels with My Aunt&quot;. She received her third Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for her performance. She also appeared in the film &quot;Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing&quot; (1973) directed by Alan J. Pakula. Her other films of this time include &quot;Murder by Death&quot; (1976) with Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writing that the film had one of Simon&#x27;s &quot;nicest, breeziest screenplays&quot; with David Niven and Maggie Smith &quot;marvellous as Dick and Dora Charleston, though they haven&#x27;t enough to do.&quot; Smith also starred as Miss Bowers in &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978) alongside Angela Lansbury, Bette Davis, Peter Ustinov and David Niven. In 1978 Smith played opposite Michael Caine in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;California Suite&quot;, playing an Oscar loser, for which she received the 1978 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She is the only person to have won an Oscar for portraying a fictional Oscar nominee. For this role, she also won her first Golden Globe Award. Afterward, upon hearing that Michael Palin was about to embark on the film &quot;The Missionary&quot; (1982) with Smith, her co-star Michael Caine is supposed to have humorously telephoned Palin, warning him that she would steal the film.

From 1976 to 1980 Smith appeared to acclaim in numerous productions at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario; her roles included: Cleopatra in &quot;Anthony and Cleopatra&quot; (1976), Titania and Hippolyta in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1977), Queen Elizabeth in &quot;Richard III&quot; (1977), Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; and Lady Macbeth in &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1978). Smith would return to Broadway in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s original play &quot;Night and Day&quot; as Ruth Carson in 1979. The play concerns a confrontation between British diplomat and an African leader over a local uprising that has attracted much media coverage. The diplomat&#x27;s wife observes everyone else&#x27;s behaviour throughout. The play received mixed reviews with Walter Kerr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praising Smith&#x27;s performance while critiquing the characters writing, &quot;Which leaves us, theatrically and dramatically, where we began, with Miss Smith. The actress can, and does, do wonders. But she can&#x27;t single‐handedly turn night into day.&quot; Smith received her second Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination.

=== 1980–1999: Established actress ===
For her role on television as Mrs Silly in &quot;All for Love&quot; (1983) she received the first of her four Best Actress BAFTA TV Award nominations. In 1987 she starred as Susan in &quot;A Bed Among the Lentils&quot;, part of Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads&quot; series, receiving a second BAFTA TV nomination. In 1981 Smith starred in the Merchant Ivory film &quot;Quartet&quot; alongside Alan Bates and Isabelle Adjani. The film premiered at the 34th Cannes Film Festival where it received positive reviews. Smith received her sixth BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress for her performance as Lois Heidler. Smith also played the goddess Thetis in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; (1981). In 1982 she starred as Daphne Castle in the locked-room mystery film &quot;Evil Under the Sun&quot; opposite Peter Ustinov, Jane Birkin and Diana Rigg. The following year, she appeared in the film &quot;Better Late Than Never&quot; alongside David Niven and Art Carney.

She won her second Best Actress BAFTA Film Awards for her role as Joyce Chilvers in the 1984 black comedy &quot;A Private Function&quot; with Michael Palin. Three pigs were used in the filming of &quot;A Private Function&quot; all named Betty. Producer Mark Shivas was advised by Intellectual Animals UK that the pigs used should be female and six months old, so as to not be too large or aggressive. However, the pigs were &quot;unpredictable and often quite dangerous&quot;. During the filming of one of the kitchen scenes, Smith was hemmed in by one of the pigs, and needed to vault over the back of it in order to escape. She also starred in the 1984 Hungarian–American film &quot;Lily in Love&quot; with Christopher Plummer.

According to Smith&#x27;s biographer, she referred to the film as &quot;the ghoulash&quot; and admitted to not understanding the Hungarian director&#x27;s direction. She also called her co-star &quot;Christopher Bummer&quot;. She won her third and fourth &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for Best Actress, for her role as Virginia Woolf in Edna O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s play, &quot;Virginia&quot; (1981) and as Millament in &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1984). She starred in the 1987 London production of &quot;Lettice and Lovage&quot; alongside Margaret Tyzack, receiving an Olivier Award nomination. She reprised the role in 1990, when it transferred to Broadway, and won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. The play was written specifically for her by the playwright Peter Shaffer. In his New York Times review, Frank Rich wrote, &quot;There is only one Maggie Smith, but audiences get at least three of her in &quot;Lettice and Lovage,&quot; the Peter Shaffer comedy that has brought this spellbinding actress back to Broadway after an indecently long absence and that has the shrewd sense to keep her glued to center stage.&quot;

Smith portrayed Charlotte Bartlett in the Merchant Ivory Production of &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1985). The film received universal acclaim earning eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. The film also starred Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, Daniel Day-Lewis, Dame Judi Dench, Simon Callow and Denholm Elliott. Smith earned her fifth Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and won her second Golden Globe Award and her third British Academy Film Award for Best Actress. Smith won her fourth BAFTA Film Awards for Best Actress for the title role in the 1987 film &quot;The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne&quot;, directed by Jack Clayton. Pauline Kael wrote: &quot;Clayton is a felicitous choice to direct a character study film about a woman&#x27;s rage against the Church for her wasted life. His first feature was &quot;Room at the Top&quot; with Simone Signoret and he made &quot;The Innocents&quot; with Deborah Kerr and &quot;The Pumpkin Eater&quot; with Anne Bancroft – he knows how to show women&#x27;s temperatures and their mind-body inter-actions. Maggie Smith becomes the essence of spinster – she makes you feel the ghastliness of knowing you&#x27;re a figure of fun.&quot;

In the early 1990s, Smith appeared in various box-office comedies. In 1991 Smith appeared as Granny Wendy in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;, a fantasy adventure film based on the Peter Pan character. The film starred Robin Williams as Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Hook and Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell. The film was a financial success, making $300 million at the box office. In 1992 Smith appeared as Mother Superior in the Whoopi Goldberg comedy film &quot;Sister Act&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993). Smith also received a third British Academy Television Award nomination for her role as Mrs. Mabel Pettigrew in the 1992 TV film &quot;Memento Mori&quot;, and her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for her role as Violet Venable in the 1993 PBS television film &quot;Suddenly, Last Summer&quot;. In 1993 she portrayed Lady Bracknell in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s comic play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre in the West End, receiving her fourth Olivier Award nomination. The following year she starred in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;Three Tall Women&quot; for which she garnered critical acclaim. Theatre critic Paul Taylor for &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote, &quot;Maggie Smith has to be seen to be believed. The sudden subsidings into wretched senile tears; the frustrated, dismissive flappings of her arm as her mind gropes impotently for a mislaid fact; the comic cunning with which she tries to cover over her patches of blankness; the beadily aggressive suspicion and the moments of alert cackling triumph – Smith&#x27;s performance which, at the moment, is firmly on the right side of caricature, captures all this and more.&quot; She received her record fifth &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for Best Actress for her performance.

Smith acted in the film adaptation of &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1993) directed by Agnieszka Holland. The film was a critical success and Smith in particular was praised for her performance as Mrs. Medlock earning a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1995 Smith portrayed the Duchess of York in another film adaptation this time of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; (1995) starring Ian McKellen in the titular role. The film adapts the play&#x27;s story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Britain, with Richard depicted as a fascist plotting to usurp the throne. The film also starred Annette Bening, Jim Broadbent, Robert Downey Jr., Nigel Hawthorne and Kristin Scott Thomas. Smith also starred in another film by Holland titled &quot;Washington Square&quot; (1997), playing the incurably foolish Aunt Lavinia Penniman. She won her fifth BAFTA Film Awards, this time for Best Supporting Actress, for the 1999 film &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot;, in which she played Lady Hester Random opposite Cher, Joan Plowright and Judi Dench. She also starred in &quot;The Last September&quot; opposite Michael Gambon and the film &quot;Curtain Call&quot; with Michael Caine in the same year.

In 1996 Smith appeared in the comedy film &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; alongside Goldie Hawn, Diane Keaton and Bette Midler. In 1997 Smith starred in another Albee play, &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot;, opposite Eileen Atkins. She received her fifth Olivier Award nomination for her performance as the witty, alcoholic Claire. Matt Wolf of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;This actress [Smith] continues to get laughs where no one else ever would ... but she can be as revealing when quiet: admitting, sad-eyed, that &#x27;time happens&#x27; or sending the audience out for the first intermission on a note of doomy suspense.&quot; In 1999 she gained critical acclaim for her performance as Miss Mary Shepherd in Alan Bennett&#x27;s drama &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot;. For her performance, she received her sixth Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress nomination. That same year, Smith starred in the BBC television adaptation of the Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; alongside Daniel Radcliffe. Smith portrayed Betsey Trotwood for which she received a British Academy Television Awards and her second Primetime Emmy Award nominations.

From 2001 to 2011, Smith played Professor Minerva McGonagall in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. Smith and Robbie Coltrane, who played Hagrid, had been requested for the film by author J. K. Rowling. Smith reunited with Radcliffe, who played the titular role of Harry Potter. Smith appeared in seven of the eight films.

In 2016 while promoting &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot;, Smith shared her experiences working on the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films and working with Alan Rickman. &quot;He [Rickman] was such a terrific actor, and that was such a terrific character that he played, and it was a joy to be with him. We used to laugh together because we ran out of reaction shots. They were always – when everything had been done and the children were finished, they would turn the camera around and we&#x27;d have to do various reaction shots of amazement or sadness and things. And we used to say we&#x27;d got to about number 200-and-something and we&#x27;d run out of knowing what to do when the camera came around on us. But he was a joy.&quot;
In 2001, Smith appeared in the British ensemble murder mystery &quot;Gosford Park&quot;, which was directed by Robert Altman. The film&#x27;s cast included Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Kristin Scott Thomas, Eileen Atkins, Emily Watson, Charles Dance, Richard E. Grant, Derek Jacobi and Stephen Fry. Her portrayal as the haughty Constance, Countess of Trentham earned Smith her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress alongside Mirren. The film premiered at the 2001 London Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim from critics, including Roger Ebert, who awarded it his highest rating of four stars, describing the story as &quot;such a joyous and audacious achievement, it deserves comparison with his [Robert Altman&#x27;s] very best movies.&quot;

In 2002 she starred in the film &quot;Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood&quot; alongside Sandra Bullock and Ellen Burstyn. That same year, Smith reunited with Dame Judi Dench for David Hare&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Breath of Life&quot;.

Smith also appeared in the British costume drama &quot;Becoming Jane&quot; (2007), a film that depicts the early life of Jane Austen, played by Anne Hathaway.

In 2007 she starred in a revival of Edward Albee&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Lady from Dubuque&quot; which ran at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the West End. David Benedict of &quot;Variety&quot; criticised the production but praised Smith, writing, &quot;The exception is Maggie Smith, who arrives in the last minute of the first act and then dominates the second. Yet even the magnetically watchable Smith cannot save the evening as a whole.&quot; In 2007 she also starred in another HBO television film, &quot;Capturing Mary&quot; alongside Ruth Wilson for which she was nominated for her fourth Primetime Emmy Award. She appeared in Julian Fellowes&#x27;s fantasy drama film &quot;From Time to Time&quot; in 2009. In 2010, she played Mrs. Docherty in period fantasy comedy film &quot;Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang&quot; opposite Emma Thompson.

From 2010 to 2015 Smith appeared as Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, in the British period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. The show became a cultural phenomenon, with her performance becoming a fan favourite. This role won her three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie as well as a Golden Globe Award and four Screen Actors Guild Awards. In a March 2015 interview with Joe Utichi in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Smith announced that the sixth season of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; would be her last (it was in fact the last to be produced).

In 2012 she played Muriel Donnelly in the British comedy &quot;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot; alongside Judi Dench, Dev Patel, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Penelope Wilton. The film was distributed by Fox Searchlight and received positive reviews. She received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for the role. The film became a surprise box-office hit following its international release and was such a financial success; it spawned the sequel &quot;The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot; in 2015. Also in 2012 Smith starred in Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Quartet&quot;, based on Ronald Harwood&#x27;s play. The film co-starred Tom Courtenay, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly and Michael Gambon. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews and garnered her a 10th Golden Globe nomination. The following year, Smith starred in the romantic comedy &quot;My Old Lady&quot; (2014) alongside Kristin Scott Thomas and Kevin Kline.
Smith participated in the filmed event &quot;National Theatre Live: 50 Years On Stage&quot; (2013), along with many actors of the stage, including Michael Gambon and Judi Dench. The programme features a variety of live performances from productions by the Royal National Theatre from the past five decades: The programme features a clip from the 1964 production of &quot;Hay Fever&quot; by Noël Coward, starring Smith and Anthony Nichols, which introduces Smith giving a live monologue from &quot;The Beaux&#x27; Stratagem&quot; by George Farquhar. Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of the event: &quot;Obviously it was moving to see legendary actors, either through archival footage or live performance, repeating past successes.&quot;

In 2015 she received rapturous reviews for her performance in the film &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot; (2015) which debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival. Kate Muir of &quot;The Times&quot; praised Smith&#x27;s performance by writing, &quot;Smith delivers a compelling performance...as Alan Bennett&#x27;s play comes to the big screen 15 years after it premiered at the Royal National Theatre.&quot; Smith received a Golden Globe Award and British Academy Film Award nominations for her performance. On 30 October 2015, Smith appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;, her first appearance on a chat show in 42 years. During the show, Smith discussed her appearance alongside Alex Jennings in the comedy-drama film &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot;, which was directed by Nicholas Hytner.

===2016–2024: Final years===
In 2018 Smith starred in a British documentary titled &quot;Nothing Like a Dame&quot;, directed by Roger Michell, which documents conversations between actresses Smith, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins and Joan Plowright, which were interspersed with scenes from their careers on film and stage. The film was released in the United States as &quot;Tea with the Dames&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film a five out of five star rating, declaring it an &quot;outrageously funny film&quot;. Guy Lodge of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film a &quot;richly enjoyable gabfest&quot; but that the film was &quot;hardly vital cinema&quot;.

In 2018 Smith reprised her role as Professor Minerva McGonagall by voicing the character in &quot;Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery&quot;, a role-playing video game. In September 2019, a continuation of the &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; series in form of a feature-length film was in theatres entitled simply, &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;.

She reprised her role as Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham in Simon Curtis&#x27;s 2022 historical-drama &quot;Downton Abbey: A New Era&quot; alongside Hugh Bonneville, Elizabeth McGovern and Michelle Dockery.

In April 2019, after an eleven-year absence from theatre, Smith returned to the stage in &quot;A German Life&quot; as Brunhilde Pomsel at the Bridge Theatre in London. The new work, by Christopher Hampton, is a one-woman solo play. In its inaugural incarnation Smith gave an extended monologue as Pomsel, an elderly German woman who, in her youth, wound up working as a secretary for Joseph Goebbels at the Ministry of Propaganda. Jonathan Kent took the directorial role. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s theatre critic praised Smith&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s a performance that combines the knowingness of hindsight with the naivety of youth, blasé enough to catch you off-guard when the magnitude of events suddenly cuts through&quot;. Matt Wolf of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;[Smith&#x27;s performance] represents a new high in a six-decade career with no shortage of peaks&quot;, and added &quot;The audience knows it is witnessing something special&quot;. Her performance won her a record sixth Best Actress &quot;Evening Standard&quot; award.

In 2021 Smith starred in the Netflix adaptation of the children&#x27;s book by Matt Haig of the same name, &quot;A Boy Called Christmas&quot;.

===Death and reactions===

Smith died at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, on 27 September 2024, aged 89.

Figures in the entertainment industry who paid tribute to Smith included her &quot;Sister Act&quot; co-star Whoopi Goldberg, who described her as &quot;a great woman and a brilliant actress. I still can&#x27;t believe I was lucky enough to work with the &#x27;one-of-a-kind&#x27;.&quot; Her &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star Daniel Radcliffe, released a statement reading, in part: &quot;I will always consider myself amazingly lucky to have been able to work with her ... the word legend is overused but if it applies to anyone in our industry then it applies to her.&quot; Another &quot;Harry Potter&quot; co-star, Emma Watson, released a statement reading, in part: &quot;She was real, honest, funny and self-honouring ... Thank you for all of your kindness.

<text>Poli Ejido 2012 Sociedad Deportiva was a Spanish football team based in El Ejido, Province of Almería, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. Founded in 1969 and dissolved in 2012, it held home matches at &quot;Estadio Municipal Santo Domingo&quot;, that seated 7,870 spectators.

The club played in pale blue shirts and white shorts, and spent seven seasons in Segunda División in the 2000s.

==History==
Polideportivo Ejido was founded in 1969. After first reaching the fourth division in 1987, the club fluctuated between that and the third levels. From 1999 to 2001 it achieved two consecutive promotions, and would go on to have an uninterrupted seven-year spell in the second division.

On 29 October 2008, freshly relegated to division three, &quot;Poli&quot; trounced La Liga giants Villarreal CF 5–0 in the fourth round of the Spanish Cup, the first with teams from the top level (6–1 final aggregate). Two seasons later the two clubs met again in the tournament, but with a different outcome (3–1 on aggregate for the Valencian club).

Polideportivo Ejido was expelled from the third division competition midway through the 2011–12 season, after failing to report to two consecutive games. Overwhelmed by financial difficulties and without any players, the club folded soon afterwards.

In January 2012 it was reborn as CD El Ejido 2012, acquired by a group of business owners and headed by Manuel Amer. It keept the clothing and the 90% of the shield, only changing the typography.

<doc id="82767" wikidata="Q654730" url="?curid=82767" title="Alan Bennett">
<text>Alan Bennett (born 9 May 1934) is an English actor, author, playwright and screenwriter. He has received numerous awards and honours including four BAFTA Awards, four Laurence Olivier Awards, and two Tony Awards. In 2005 he received the Society of London Theatre Special Award. 

Bennett was born in Leeds and attended Oxford University. He taught medieval history at the university for several years. His work in the satirical revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival brought him instant fame and later a Special Tony Award. He turned to writing full time and gained acclaim with his plays at the Royal National Theatre. The following plays were adapted into films: &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994), &quot;The History Boys&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot; (2015).

==Early life==
Bennett was born on 9 May 1934 in Armley, Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire. The younger son of a Co-op butcher, Walter, and his wife, Lilian Mary (née Peel), Bennett attended Christ Church, Upper Armley, Church of England School (in the same class as Barbara Taylor Bradford), and then Leeds Modern School (now Lawnswood School). He has an older brother.

Bennett learned Russian at the Joint Services School for Linguists during his national service before applying for a scholarship at Oxford University. He was accepted by Exeter College, Oxford, and graduated with a first-class degree in history. While at Oxford he performed comedy with a number of eventually successful actors in the Oxford Revue. He remained at the university for several years, working as a junior lecturer of Medieval History at Magdalen College, before deciding, in 1960, that he was not suited to being an academic.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
In August 1960, Bennett – along with Dudley Moore, Jonathan Miller and Peter Cook – gained fame after an appearance at the Edinburgh Festival in the satirical revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, with the show continuing in London and New York. He also appeared in &quot;My Father Knew Lloyd George&quot;. His television comedy sketch series &quot;On the Margin&quot; (1966) was erased; the BBC re-used expensive videotape rather than keep it in the archives. However, in 2014 it was announced that audio copies of the entire series had been found.

Bennett&#x27;s first stage play, &quot;Forty Years On,&quot; directed by Patrick Garland and starring John Gielgud, was produced in 1968. His second play, &quot;Getting On&quot;, also directed by Garland and starring Kenneth More, opened in 1971. Many television, stage and radio plays followed, with screenplays, short stories, novellas, a large body of non-fictional prose, and broadcasting and many appearances as an actor.

Despite a long history with both the National Theatre and the BBC, Bennett never writes on commission, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t work on commission, I just do it on spec. If people don&#x27;t want it then it&#x27;s too bad.&quot;

Bennett&#x27;s many works for television include his first play for the medium, &quot;A Day Out&quot; in 1972, &quot;A Little Outing&quot; in 1977, &quot;Intensive Care&quot; in 1982, &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; in 1983, and &quot;A Question of Attribution&quot; in 1991. But perhaps his most famous screen work is the 1988 &quot;Talking Heads&quot; series of monologues for television which were later performed at the Comedy Theatre in London in 1992. A second set of six &quot;Talking Heads&quot; followed a decade later.

=== 1980s ===
Bennett wrote the play &quot;Enjoy&quot; in 1980. It barely scraped a run of seven weeks at the Vaudeville Theatre, in spite of the stellar cast of Joan Plowright, Colin Blakely, Susan Littler, Philip Sayer, Liz Smith (who replaced Joan Hickson during rehearsals) and, in his first West End role, Marc Sinden. It was directed by Ronald Eyre. A new production of &quot;Enjoy&quot; attracted very favourable notices during its 2008 UK tour and moved to the West End of London in January 2009. The West End show took more than £1 million in advance ticket sales and even extended the run to cope with demand. The production starred Alison Steadman, David Troughton, Richard Glaves, Carol Macready and Josie Walker.

=== 1990s ===
Bennett wrote &quot;The Lady in the Van&quot; based on his experiences with an eccentric woman called Miss Shepherd, who lived on Bennett&#x27;s driveway in a series of dilapidated vans for more than fifteen years. It was first published in 1989 as an essay in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;. In 1990 he published it in book form. In 1999 he adapted it into a stage play, which starred Maggie Smith and was directed by Nicholas Hytner. The stage play includes two characters named Alan Bennett. On 21 February 2009 it was broadcast as a radio play on BBC Radio 4, with Maggie Smith reprising her role and Alan Bennett playing himself. He adapted the story again for a 2015 film, with Maggie Smith reprising her role again, and Nicholas Hytner directing again. In the film Alex Jennings plays the two versions of Bennett, although Alan Bennett appears in a cameo at the very end of the film.

Bennett adapted his 1991 play &quot;The Madness of George III&quot; for the cinema. Entitled &quot;The Madness of King George&quot; (1994), the film received four Academy Award nominations: for Bennett&#x27;s writing and the performances of Nigel Hawthorne and Helen Mirren. It won the award for best art direction.

In 1995 Bennett wrote and hosted the three-part BBC documentary series &quot;The Abbey&quot;, directed by Jonathan Stedall. The programme provides a personal tribute to, and tour of, Westminster Abbey.

=== 21st century ===

Bennett&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;The History Boys&quot; won three Laurence Olivier Awards in 2005, for Best New Play, Best Actor (Richard Griffiths), and Best Direction (Nicholas Hytner), having previously won Critics&#x27; Circle Theatre Awards and Evening Standard Awards for Best Actor and Best Play. Bennett also received the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Theatre. &quot;The History Boys&quot; won six Tony Awards on Broadway, including best play, best performance by a leading actor in a play (Richard Griffiths), best performance by a featured actress in a play (Frances de la Tour) and best direction of a play (Nicholas Hytner). A film version of &quot;The History Boys&quot; was released in the UK in October 2006. In his 2005 prose collection &quot;Untold Stories&quot;, Bennett wrote of the mental illness that his mother and other family members suffered.

At the National Theatre in late 2009 Nicholas Hytner directed Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;The Habit of Art&quot;, about the relationship between the poet W. H. Auden and the composer Benjamin Britten.

Bennett&#x27;s play &quot;People&quot; opened at the National Theatre in October 2012. In December that year, &quot;Cocktail Sticks&quot;, an autobiographical play by Bennett, premièred at the National Theatre as part of a double bill with the monologue &quot;Hymn&quot;. The production was directed by Bennett&#x27;s long-term collaborator Nicholas Hytner. It was well-received, and transferred to the Duchess Theatre in the West End of London, being subsequently adapted for radio broadcast by BBC Radio 4.

In July 2018, &quot;Allelujah!&quot;, a comic drama by Bennett about a National Health Service hospital threatened with closure, opened at London&#x27;s Bridge Theatre to critical acclaim.

==Personal life==

Bennett lived for 40 years on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town, London, and in 2006 moved a few minutes&#x27; walk away to Primrose Hill with his partner Rupert Thomas, the former editor of &quot;The World of Interiors&quot; magazine. Bennett also had a long-term relationship with his former housekeeper, Anne Davies, until her death in 2009.

Bennett is an agnostic. He was raised Anglican and gradually &quot;left it [the church] over the years&quot;.

In 1988, Bennett declined the award of Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and in 1996 declined a knighthood.

In September 2005, Bennett revealed that, in 1997, he had undergone treatment for colorectal cancer and described the illness as a &quot;bore&quot;. His chances of survival were given as being &quot;much less&quot; than 50 per cent and surgeons had told him they removed a &quot;rock-bun&quot; sized tumour. He began &quot;Untold Stories&quot; (published 2005) thinking it would be published posthumously, but his cancer went into remission.

In the autobiographical sketches which form a large part of the book Bennett says of himself &quot;I am homosexual&quot;, but also mentions &quot;flings&quot; with women. Previously Bennett had referred to questions about his sexuality as like asking a man who has just crawled across the Sahara desert to choose between Perrier or Malvern mineral water.

In October 2008, Bennett announced that he was donating his entire archive of working papers, unpublished manuscripts, diaries and books to the Bodleian Library, stating that it was a gesture of thanks repaying a debt he felt he owed to the British welfare state that had given him educational opportunities which his humble family background would otherwise never have afforded.

In September 2015, Bennett endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. The following month, after Corbyn&#x27;s election victory, Bennett said: &quot;I approve of him. If only because it brings Labour back to what they ought to be thinking about.&quot;

Following the death of Jonathan Miller in 2019, Bennett became the only surviving member of the original &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; quartet which had also included Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.

For many years Bennett has owned a cottage in Clapham in the Yorkshire Dales.

==Awards and honours==
Bennett was made an Honorary Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, in 1987. He was also awarded a D.Litt by the University of Leeds in 1990 and an honorary doctorate from Kingston University in 1996. In 1998 he refused an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, in protest at its acceptance of funding for a chair from press baron Rupert Murdoch. He also declined a CBE in 1988 and a knighthood in 1996. He has stated that, although he is not a republican, he would never wish to be knighted, saying it would be a bit like having to wear a suit for the rest of his life.

In December 2011, Bennett returned to Lawnswood School, nearly 60 years after he left, to unveil the renamed Alan Bennett Library. He said he &quot;loosely&quot; based &quot;The History Boys&quot; on his experiences at the school and his admission to Oxford. Lawnswood School dedicated its library to the writer after he emerged as a vocal campaigner against public library cuts. Plans to shut local libraries were &quot;wrong and very short-sighted&quot;, Bennett said, adding: &quot;We&#x27;re impoverishing young people.&quot;

<text>Eric Stanton (born Ernest Stanzoni Jr.; September 30, 1926 – March 17, 1999) was an American underground cartoonist and fetish art pioneer.

While Stanton began his career as a bondage fantasy artist for Irving Klaw, the majority of his later work depicted gender role reversal and proto-feminist female dominance scenarios. Commissioned by Klaw starting in the late 1940s, his bondage fantasy chapter serials earned him underground fame. Stanton also worked with pioneering underground fetish art publishers, Leonard Burtman (publisher of &quot;Exotique&quot; and Selbee magazines), the notorious Times Square publisher Edward Mishkin, paperback publisher Stanley Malkin, and later magazine publisher George W. Mavety. For a decade, Stanton also shared a working studio with Marvel Comics legend Steve Ditko.

Past the soft-core era of the 1960s, his art became more transgressive. Creating a mail-order business in the 1970s named the &quot;Stanton Archives,&quot; Stanton sold his work directly to fans and, starting in 1982, issued offset staple-bound fan-inspired books known as &quot;Stantoons,&quot; producing more than a hundred by the time of his death. In his lifetime, Stanton also contributed to countless underground publications and later adult magazines like &quot;Leg Show&quot; and &quot;Leg World&quot;. In 1984, Stanton had the only art exhibit in his lifetime at the New York City nightclub Danceteria. Artists Banksy, Allen Jones, and Madonna among others took inspiration from Stanton&#x27;s work.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Stanton was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, the son of an Italian father and a Russian mother. During World War II, while in the US Navy, a head injury left him partially color blind. Following this, he was an art assistant to Boody Rogers on &quot;Sparky Watts&quot; or &quot;Babe,&quot; supplying background art and plot ideas. Though his personal preference was for drawing lady wrestling and fighting women comics, he was commissioned to create bondage fantasy chapter serials by Irving Klaw, who also sold pin-ups and movie stills from his shop on 212 E. 14th Street. This marked the beginning of his fetish art career. Stanton then attended the Cartoonists and Illustrators School in the early 1950s, studying under comics artist Jerry Robinson and others. One classmate was future Spider-Man and Dr. Strange co-creator Steve Ditko. Another was Gene Bilbrew, whom he introduced to Klaw.
From 1958 to 1968, Stanton shared a Manhattan studio at 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue with Ditko. For many years, the two collaborated on fetish comics. Ditko biographer Blake Bell, without citing sources, said, &quot;At one time in history, Ditko denied ever touching Stanton&#x27;s work, even though Stanton himself said they would each dabble in each other&#x27;s art; mainly spot-inking&quot;, and the introduction to one book of Stanton&#x27;s work says, &quot;Eric Stanton drew his pictures in India ink, and they were then hand-coloured by Ditko&quot;. In a 1988 interview with Greg Theakston, Stanton recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was &quot;almost nil&quot;, he and Ditko had &quot;worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands&quot;. According to the fetish art historian and Stanton biographer Richard Pérez Seves, Stanton may have purposely underplayed his role and contribution to Spider-Man to maintain his friendship with Ditko. Even more startling, evidence exists that Stanton also made uncredited contributions to Dr. Strange.

===Later career===

Starting in the late 1960s, Stanton supported himself by self-publishing and distributing his work to a quasi-underground network of subscribers and patrons. His offset printed &quot;Stantoons&quot; comic-book series, which began in 1982, continued to his death in 1999 and featured many of his best-known &quot;transgressive&quot; concepts, including the superheroine Blunder Broad, and the Amazon-like Princkazons.

====Blunder Broad====
Stanton created Blunder Broad in the 1970s with writer Andrew J. Offutt (a.k.a. &quot;Turk Winter&quot;) for use in a great number of BDSM adventures. A parody of Wonder Woman, Blunder Broad is an inept superheroine who continually fails in her missions and is invariably tortured by her enemies, who include a lesbian supervillainess called Leopard Lady, Pussycat Galore, or Cheetah, and her male sidekick Count Dastardly. Blunder Broad can be deprived of her super strength when subjected to cunnilingus.

====Princkazons====
With &quot;Lady Princker&quot;, Stanton and Shaltis (as well as Alan Throne and Winter) created the Princkazons storyline in which women around the world grew oversized female penises, or &quot;princks&quot;. These women also grew taller and stronger than men and began dominating and humiliating the men in public, including facesitting, urophagia, coprophagia, and anal and oral rape.

==Legacy==
Beginning in the mid-1970s, Bélier Press, a New York publisher of vintage fetish art, reprinted many of Stanton&#x27;s comic serials in its 24-volume &quot;Bizarre Comix&quot; series. Titles, mainly from the 1950s, include &quot;Dianna&#x27;s Ordeal&quot;, &quot;Perils of Dianna&quot;, &quot;Priscilla: Queen of Escapes&quot;, &quot;Poor Pamela&quot;, &quot;Bound in Leather&quot;, &quot;Duchess of the Bastille&quot;, &quot;Bizarre Museum&quot;, &quot;Pleasure Bound&quot;, &quot;Rita&#x27;s School of Discipline&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Tyrant&#x27;s Finishing School&quot;, &quot;Fifi Chastises Her Maids&quot;, &quot;A Hazardous Journey&quot;, &quot;Helga&#x27;s Search for Slaves&quot;, &quot;Madame Discipline&quot;, and &quot;Girls&#x27; Figure Training Academy&quot;.

Book-length collections of Stanton comics have been translated into many foreign languages, including French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Dutch. Additionally, Stanton&#x27;s art was reprinted in the 1990s in comic books from Fantagraphics Books&#x27; imprint Eros Comix: &quot;The Kinky Hook&quot; (1991), &quot;Sweeter Gwen&quot; (1992), &quot;Confidential TV&quot; (1994), and &quot;Tops and Bottoms&quot; #1–4 (1997). Individual issues were subtitled &quot;Bound Beauty&quot; (#1), &quot;Lady in Charge&quot; (#2), &quot;Broken Engagement&quot; (#3), and &quot;Broken Engagement 2&quot; (#4).

<doc id="82772" wikidata="Q220693" url="?curid=82772" title="Marilyn Chambers">
<text>Marilyn Ann Taylor (née Briggs; April 22, 1952 – April 12, 2009), known professionally as Marilyn Chambers, was an American pornographic actress, exotic dancer, model, actress, singer and vice-presidential candidate. She was known for her 1972 hardcore film debut, &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;, and her 1980 pornographic film &quot;Insatiable&quot;. She ranked at No. 6 on the list of Top 50 Porn Stars of All Time by AVN, and ranked as one of Playboy&#x27;s Top 100 Sex Stars of the Century in 1999. Although she was primarily known for her adult film work, she made a successful transition to mainstream projects and has been called &quot;porn&#x27;s most famous crossover&quot;.

==Early life==
Born Marilyn Ann Briggs in Providence, Rhode Island, Chambers was raised in Westport, Connecticut, in a middle-class household. It is often reported that she was born in Westport; however, in a 2007 interview, Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport. Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, a brother, Bill Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston band The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith. Chambers attended Burr Farms Elementary School, Hillspoint Elementary School, Long Lots Junior High School, and Staples High School where she graduated in 1970 and was voted &quot;Best Student Body&quot;. Her father tried to discourage her from pursuing a modeling career, citing brutal competition. &quot;Ever since I was a little kid, I&#x27;ve always wanted to be an actress,&quot; Chambers said in 1997. &quot;I was always a performer, a junior Olympic diver, a junior Olympic gymnast. My mother always told me I was a show-off&quot;.

&quot;When I was about 16, I learned how to write my mother’s name on notes to get out of school&quot;, she said. &quot;And then I&#x27;d take the train into the city to go to auditions&quot;. While in high school, she landed some modeling assignments and a small role in the film &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; (1970), in which Chambers was credited as Evelyn Lang. During her early career as a model, her most prominent job was as the &quot;Ivory Soap girl&quot; on the Ivory Snow soap flake box, posing as a mother holding a baby under the tag line &quot;99 &amp; 44/100% pure&quot;.

==Career==

===&quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;===
Upon the release of &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot;, Chambers was sent to Los Angeles and San Francisco on a promotional tour. After that, she did not receive any roles except for a low-budget film, writer-director-producer Sean S. Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Together&quot; (1971), in which she appeared nude. In 1970, she moved from Westport to San Francisco, where she held several jobs that included topless model and bottomless dancer. &quot;I moved to San Francisco, thinking it was the entertainment capital of the world, which indeed, it is not,&quot; she said.

Chambers sought work in theater and dance groups in San Francisco to no avail. In 1972, she saw an advertisement in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; for a casting call for what was billed as a &quot;major motion picture&quot;. She rushed to the audition only to find it was for a pornographic film, which was to be called &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;. She was about to leave when producers Artie and Jim Mitchell noticed her resemblance to Cybill Shepherd. They invited her upstairs to their offices and told her the film&#x27;s plot. Chambers was highly dubious about accepting a role in a pornographic film, fearing it might ruin her chances at breaking into the mainstream. But she was turned on by the fantasy of the story and decided to take a chance, under the condition that she receive a hefty salary and 10 percent of the film&#x27;s gross. She also insisted that each actor get tested for venereal disease. The Mitchell Brothers balked at her request for a percentage of the film&#x27;s profits, but finally agreed, realizing the film needed a wholesome blonde actress.

The film told the story of a wealthy San Francisco socialite, Gloria Saunders (Chambers), who is taken against her will to an elite North Beach sex club and loved as she&#x27;s never been loved before. Unusually, Chambers does not have a single word of dialogue in the entire film. After engaging in lesbian sex with a group of six women, she then has sex with actor Johnnie Keyes. This possibly makes &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; the first U.S. feature-length hardcore film to include an interracial sex scene. The porn industry and viewing public were shocked by the then-taboo spectacle of a white woman having sex with a black man. The scene with Keyes is followed by Chambers mounting a trapeze contraption suspended from the ceiling. She then engages in vaginal intercourse with one man as she performs oral sex on another and masturbates two others.

&quot;Each sequence &quot;was&quot; a surprise to me&quot;, she said in 1987. &quot;They never told me what was happening next. I just did it as it happened, and it worked. I&#x27;ve always been highly sexed. Oh, my God, I love it! Insatiable &quot;is&quot; the right word for me.&quot;

After filming concluded, she informed the Mitchell Brothers that she was &quot;the Ivory Snow Girl&quot;; the Mitchells capitalized on this by billing her as the &quot;99 and 44/100% impure&quot; girl. Although she said at the time the film would help &quot;sell a lot more soap&quot;, Procter &amp; Gamble quickly dropped her after discovering her double life as an adult-film actress, and the advertising industry was scandalized. The fact that Chambers&#x27;s image was so well known from Ivory Snow boosted the film&#x27;s ticket sales, and led to several jokes on television talk shows. Nearly every adult film she made following this incident featured a cameo of her Ivory Snow box.

Chambers was relatively unknown prior to &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;; however, the film made her a star. &quot;Green Door&quot;, along with &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, released the same year, and &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, ushered in what is commonly known as the porno chic era.

===&quot;Resurrection of Eve&quot; and &quot;Inside Marilyn Chambers&quot;===
Following &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;, the Mitchell Brothers and Chambers teamed up for &quot;Resurrection of Eve&quot;, released in September 1973. Although not the runaway blockbuster that &quot;Green Door&quot; was, &quot;Eve&quot; was a hit and a well-received entry into the porno chic market. It also helped set Chambers apart from her contemporaries Linda Lovelace and Georgina Spelvin as the wholesome, all-American girl next door. Following &quot;Eve&quot;, Chambers was anxious to transition her fame into other areas of entertainment. At the time, the Mitchell Brothers were still her managers. &quot;They were always talking about some half-assed idea I knew wouldn&#x27;t come off&quot;, Chambers said in 1992. Flakes&#x27; is a terrible word but they were, in a cute sort of way&quot;. Chambers had always considered the brothers as her own brothers but when she abruptly announced that she was leaving them to take up with Chuck Traynor, they were appalled and had a falling out with Chambers.

In retaliation, the brothers created a documentary in 1976 called &quot;Inside Marilyn Chambers&quot;, which was composed of alternate shots and outtakes from &quot;Green Door&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot;, as well as interviews with some of her co-stars. This was done without Chambers&#x27;s knowledge or approval but when she learned of it just prior to its release, she negotiated a deal that would offer her 10% of the gross as long as she would contribute interviews to the film and promote it nationally. &quot;I hated the film and I still do&quot;, she said later. &quot;It&#x27;s supposed to be the story of my life, and it&#x27;s not true. Jim and Art ripped me off. They felt I&#x27;d betrayed them... I felt they&#x27;d betrayed me, and for many years, we didn&#x27;t speak. Only when money was to be made did we start talking again.&quot; Chambers reunited with the Mitchell Brothers in 1979 for two 30-minute features called &quot;Beyond de Sade&quot; and &quot;Never a Tender Moment&quot;, which explored BDSM. The films, which were shot at the Mitchell Brothers Theatre, co-starred Erica Boyer.

=== Mainstream crossover ===

==== Hollywood ====
Chambers dreamed of having a career in mainstream films and believed her celebrity as the star of &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; and the Ivory Snow girl would be a stepping stone to other endeavors. &quot;The paradox was that, as a result of &quot;Green Door&quot;, Hollywood blackballed me,&quot; she said later. &quot;[&quot;Green Door&quot;] became a very high-grossing film ... But, to a lot of people, it was still a dirty movie; for me to do anything else, as an &quot;actress&quot;, was totally out of the question. I became known as a porno star, and that type of labeling really hurt me. It hurt my chances of doing anything else.&quot;

Throughout the 1970s, producers of several Hollywood films considered casting her. Her biggest opportunity came in 1976 when it was announced in &quot;Variety&quot; that she was to star alongside Rip Torn in &quot;City Blues&quot;, a film about a young hooker defended by a seedy lawyer. The film was to be directed by Nicholas Ray. Ray had never seen &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; or even screen-tested Chambers. Instead, the two met and Ray was impressed. &quot;I have a camera in my head,&quot; he said, adding that Chambers would &quot;eventually be able to handle anything that the young Katie Hepburn or Bette Davis could.&quot; However, the project never came to fruition, in large part due to Ray&#x27;s alcohol and drug abuse. Ray died in 1979.

Chambers claimed that Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel brought her in to talk about a role in the 1978 film &quot;Goin&#x27; South&quot;, then asked her for cocaine and grilled her about whether her orgasms in &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; were real; she was angered to the point where she stormed out of the interview. She was going to be cast in the film &quot;Hardcore&quot;, opposite George C. Scott, but the casting director took one look at her and said she was too wholesome to be cast as a porn queen. &quot;The &quot;Hardcore&quot; people wanted a woman with orange hair who chews gum, swings a big purse, and wears stiletto heels. That&#x27;s such a cliche,&quot; Chambers said years later. Season Hubley was cast instead.

==== &quot;Rabid&quot; ====
Chambers won the starring role in film director David Cronenberg&#x27;s low-budget Canadian movie, &quot;Rabid&quot;, which was released in 1977. Cronenberg stated that he wanted to cast Sissy Spacek in the film lead, but the studio vetoed his choice because of her accent. The director says that the idea of casting Chambers came from producer Ivan Reitman, who had heard that Chambers was looking for a mainstream role. Reitman felt that it would be easier to market the film in different territories if the well-known porn star portrayed the main character. Cronenberg stated that Chambers put in a lot of hard work on the film and that he was impressed with her. Cronenberg further states he had not seen &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; prior to casting her.

&quot;It was great working with David,&quot; Chambers said in a 1997 interview. &quot;He taught me a lot of things that were very valuable as an actress, especially in horror films. I found it useful in sex films, too!&quot;

==== Theater work ====
In 1974, she starred in the dinner theater production of &quot;The Mind With the Dirty Man&quot; in Las Vegas and received favorable reviews for her work. The play ran for 52 weeks which, at the time, was the longest-running play in Vegas history, and the mayor gave Chambers the key to the city. In 1976, she starred in a short-lived musical revue off-Broadway called &quot;Le Bellybutton&quot;. In 1977, she starred in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers&quot; in Vegas. The one-woman show &quot;Sex Surrogate&quot;, in 1979, caused controversy in Las Vegas as it featured full-frontal nudity, which was banned from all major hotel casino showrooms. In 1983, the play was spun off into a 26-part syndicated soap opera called &quot;Love Ya, Florence Nightingale&quot;. It was broadcast on cable television channels such as the Playboy Channel.

==== Singing career ====
Chambers had some chart success with the disco single &quot;Benihana&quot; in 1976, produced by Michael Zager on the Roulette Records label. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said, &quot;She... sings quite nicely in a sexy little voice in this catchy disco tribute to an oriental lover man.&quot; The song is played in the background of one scene in the film &quot;Rabid&quot;. In &quot;Insatiable&quot;, she sang the theme song, &quot;Shame On You,&quot; which plays over the opening credits. She did the same for the song, &quot;Still Insatiable&quot;, which was used in her comeback in the 1999 adult film of the same name. She also sang vocals in the 1983 X-rated film, &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Coming&quot;, in which she plays a rising country music star. In the early 1980s, she was the lead singer of a country and western band called Haywire.

==== Published works ====
Chambers wrote an autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, in 1975, and co-authored &quot;Xaviera Meets Marilyn Chambers&quot; with Xaviera Hollander in 1977. Both were published by Warner Communications. She also wrote a sex advice column in the mid-to-late 1970&#x27;s for &quot;Genesis&quot; magazine called &quot;Private Chambers&quot;, and one for &quot;Club&quot; magazine throughout the 1980s called &quot;State of the Nation&quot;. In 1981, she released a book of sex positions and tips called &quot;Sensual Secrets&quot;. One of the male models featured in the photos with Marilyn was a young Ron Jeremy. The same year, she released another sex manual called &quot;The Illustrated Kama Sutra&quot;.

==== &quot;Insatiable&quot; and return to porn ====

Although she had tried for several years to shed her image as a porn star, Chambers returned to the adult film industry with 1980&#x27;s &quot;Insatiable&quot;. In the film, she played actress, model, and heiress Sandra Chase, whose appetite for sex is, as the title suggests, insatiable. Sandra is getting ready to make a movie and her manager, played by Jessie St. James, is working on getting some big names to appear alongside Sandra. The story is told in a series of flashbacks which detail Sandra&#x27;s sexual encounters.

&quot;My manager had never really wanted me to do X-rated film[s],&quot; she said in 1997. &quot;He tried to move me out of that, but—seeing as things didn&#x27;t go that way, and I wasn&#x27;t getting any legitimate projects—it was something that we needed to do. I was known in the X-rated business, and it was the right time. It was a cool story and the budget was going to be a lot higher; there were going to be helicopters and Ferraris. It was going to be very classy. There were some names in it that would be good for the box office, [including John Holmes] and that was at a time when X-films were still playing in theaters.&quot;

The bet paid off. &quot;Insatiable&quot; was the top-selling adult video in the U.S. from 1980 to 1982 and it was inducted in the XRCO Hall of Fame. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;Insatiable II&quot; in 1984. Another X-rated film, &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Coming&quot;, was released in 1983. She also released six direct-to-video features in the early 1980s called &quot;Marilyn Chambers&#x27; Private Fantasies&quot;, in which she acted out her own sexual fantasies alongside some of the biggest names in the industry. The scenarios and dialogue for the series were written by Chambers. Despite her return to the adult-film world, Chambers dreamed of launching a successful mainstream acting career, but was unable to do so.

Chambers left the pornography business because of the increasing fear of AIDS. In 1999, Chambers returned to San Francisco to perform at the Mitchell Brothers&#x27; O&#x27;Farrell Theatre. Mayor Willie Brown proclaimed a &quot;Marilyn Chambers Day&quot; for her unique place in San Francisco history, and praised her for her &quot;artistic presence&quot;, her &quot;vision&quot;, and her &quot;energy&quot;. That same year Chambers returned to adult features with a trio of films made for VCA Pictures called &quot;Still Insatiable&quot; (1999), &quot;Dark Chambers&quot; (2000), and &quot;Edge Play&quot; (2000), each directed by Veronica Hart.

Near the end of her career, Chambers appeared primarily in independent films, including her last role in &quot;Solitaire&quot;. Chambers claimed that the more laid-back pace of these roles suited her as &quot;there&#x27;s a lot less pressure on you to perform [and] you don&#x27;t have to be young and skinny&quot;. Among these were &quot;Bikini Bistro&quot;, &quot;Angel of H.E.A.T.&quot; (with Mary Woronov), &quot;Party Incorporated&quot;, and &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot;.

In a 2004 interview, Chambers said, &quot;My advice to somebody who wants to go into adult films is: absolutely not! It&#x27;s heart-breaking. It leaves you kind of empty. So have a day job and don&#x27;t quit it&quot;.

==1985 arrests==
On February 1, 1985, while performing her nude act at the &quot;Cine-Stage&quot; within the Mitchell Brothers&#x27; O&#x27;Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, Chambers was arrested by a vice squad and charged with committing a lewd act in a public place and soliciting prostitution. It was alleged by plainclothes policemen who were in the audience that Chambers allowed audience members to touch her with their hands and mouths during her show called &quot;Feel the Magic&quot;. She was released on $2,000 bail and the charges were later dropped. &quot;I&#x27;ve never been arrested in my life for anything, ever, so this is kind of a big shock to me, not only as a performer but as a human being&quot;, Chambers said at the time. &quot;It&#x27;s a heartbreaker. This is supposed to be a hip city. I really love—make that LOVED—this city. These people have been my fans for years, and it&#x27;s a thrill for them to touch me up close. There&#x27;s nothing illegal if I&#x27;m not taking money.&quot;

Chambers&#x27; attorney claimed that Chambers was used &quot;as a pawn in a struggle over control of adult businesses.&quot; Chambers&#x27; arrest came three days before the Board of Supervisors were to vote on a proposed ordinance to eliminate police permits for adult bookstores and theaters. In the wake of her arrest, the Board stripped police of their power to license the city&#x27;s adult theaters. &quot;The O&#x27;Farrell was packed the day after we were arrested,&quot; Chambers said later. &quot;And they put the mayor&#x27;s phone number up on the marquee—&#x27;Call Mayor Dianne Feinstein&#x27;... I&#x27;m in jail with my fur coat and nothing else on, and [the police officers] want to take pictures. I took a mug shot with every cop in the place, and they&#x27;re going, &#x27;I&#x27;m really sorry we had to do this.&#x27; And the next night they were all back enjoying the show&quot;.

Later that year on December 13, 1985, she was arrested during a performance at Stage Door Johnny&#x27;s, a strip club in Cleveland. Police said she was nude except for her shoes and was having sexual contact with an audience member. She was charged with promoting prostitution and was held in jail until she was freed on a $1,000 bond. Chambers denied the charge, saying, &quot;I did the same show I&#x27;ve been doing for the last six years. Police just happened to be in the audience.&quot; In November 2012, the mugshots from Chambers&#x27;s Cleveland arrest sold on eBay for $202.50.

==Efforts in politics==
In the 2004 United States presidential election, Chambers ran for vice president on the Personal Choice Party ticket, a libertarian political party. She received a total of 946 votes. In the 2008 United States presidential election, she was again Charles Jay&#x27;s running mate, this time as an alternate write-in candidate to his primary national Boston Tea Party running mate Thomas L. Knapp in the states of Arkansas, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.

==Personal life==
Chambers was married three times. Her first marriage was to Doug Chapin, whom she met while he was playing bagpipes for money on the streets of San Francisco. They married in 1971. She divorced Chapin in 1974 and married Chuck Traynor, who was recently divorced from Linda Lovelace. He also became her manager and they were together for ten years.

In the mid-1980s, Chambers was &quot;on her way to an early grave, consuming massive amounts of alcohol and cocaine daily when she met her husband-to-be&quot;, William Taylor, Jr., a truck driver, on a blind date. After their first date, he called her to say that he could not see her because he was a recovering heroin addict. Chambers got so angry that she kicked a wall and broke her leg. Taylor came to visit Chambers in the hospital and, upon her release, they began a romance and Chambers entered Narcotics Anonymous. The couple married around 1991 or 1992 and had one child, McKenna Marie Taylor, in 1992 before divorcing in 1994. When Chambers became clean and sober during the early 1990s, her Lexus had a vanity plate that read &quot;LUV NA&quot;.

==Death==
On April 12, 2009, Chambers was found dead in her home near Santa Clarita, California. She was discovered by her 17-year-old daughter. The LA County Coroner&#x27;s autopsy revealed Chambers died of a cerebral hemorrhage caused by an aneurysm related to heart disease. Chambers was ten days short of her 57th birthday. The Associated Press reported she was survived by her daughter, sister, and brother. Her ashes were scattered at sea.

==Fictional portrayal==
In 2000, Tracy Hutson played Chambers in the cable television biographical film &quot;Rated X&quot;, about the Mitchell brothers&#x27; film and Chambers&#x27;s strip-club career.

Chambers is the subject of a biography written by Jared Stearns titled &quot;Pure: The Sexual Revolutions of Marilyn Chambers&quot; which was published in early 2024 by Headpress Books.

<text>Club Deportivo Numancia de Soria, S.A.D. is a Spanish football club in Soria, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. Founded on 9 April 1945, it plays in , holding home games at &quot;Nuevo Estadio Los Pajaritos&quot;.

Besides football it had other departments in sports, such as volleyball, women&#x27;s handball, and rhythmic gymnastics.

==History==
The club was founded on 9 April 1945. Numancia was named after the ancient Celtiberian town of Numantia, near where Soria would be later founded. Having spent a long time in the &quot;Tercera División&quot;, the club made consistent progress, reaching the first division on three occasions: 1999, 2004 and 2008.

The club became first widely known in Spain in 1995–96, while still playing at the third level, for its extraordinary run in the Spanish Cup, eliminating three top flight clubs (Real Sociedad, Racing de Santander and Sporting de Gijón) and only being knocked out in the quarter-finals by Barcelona, after Numancia drew in the first leg and took the lead in the second.

Numancia&#x27;s most important milestone came in 1999, when the team managed to promote to La Liga for the first time. In the 1998–99 season, Numancia finished third in Segunda, only behind Málaga CF and Atlético Madrid B, meaning the promotion to the top tier. Their first ever season in the Spanish elite proved to be challenging. Numancia eventually finished 17th, thus avoiding an immediate relegation to Segunda. Their survival was made possible because of unexpectedly good home results. Numancia won 9 home games, drew 6, and lost only 4 games at home. Their second season in the elite was less successful, as the team finished in last place. Numancia again displayed strong results at home, winning eight of their ten wins at home. However, that was eventually not enough to avoid a drop to Segunda, after a two-year spell in La Liga.

Numancia spent three seasons in Segunda Division, before promotion again after the 2003–04 season, as the club finished third. Numancia&#x27;second spell in the Spanish top tier was not successful as it only won 6 games. This meant that relegation followed just one season after.

Following another three years in Segunda, Numancia came back to La Liga for season 2008–09. Following a 1–3 loss at Sporting de Gijón on 2 November 2008, Numancia had conceded a total of 200 goals in the top division in slightly more than three seasons, reaching 44th in the all-time list. It battled bravely against relegation, but eventually returned to level two after just one year, as second from bottom, even though the season had started on a high note with a 1–0 home win against eventual champions Barcelona.

Numancia was relegated to third division followed at the end of the 2019-20 season after 23 years playing between first and second division. On next season, due to restructuring of the Spanish football league system, Numancia failed to survive in the third-tier and was relegated to the newly fourth-tier Segunda División RFEF, for the 2021–22 season. In the following season, Numancia achieved promoted back to newly third division, Primera División RFEF.

<doc id="82776" wikidata="Q768267" url="?curid=82776" title="Breakfast cereal">
<text>Breakfast cereal is a category of food, including food products, made from processed cereal grains, that are eaten as part of breakfast or as a snack food, primarily in Western societies.

Although warm, cooked cereals like oat meal, corn grits, and wheat farina have the longest history as traditional breakfast foods, branded and &quot;ready-to-eat cold cereals&quot; (many produced via the process of extrusion) appeared around the late 19th century. These processed, precooked, packaged cereals are most often served in a quick and simple preparation with dairy products, traditionally cow&#x27;s milk. These modern cereals can also be paired with yoghurt or plant-based milks, or eaten plain. Fruit or nuts are sometimes added, and may enhance the nutritional benefits.

Some companies promote their products for the health benefits that come from eating oat-based and high-fiber cereals. In the United States, cereals are often fortified with vitamins, but can still lack many of the vitamins needed for a healthful breakfast, and so initial marketing focused on making the new products &quot;part of a complete breakfast&quot;. A significant proportion of packaged cereals have a high sugar content (&quot;sugar cereals&quot; or even &quot;kids&#x27; cereals&quot; in common parlance). These cereals are frequently marketed toward children (in television ads, comic books, etc.) and often feature a cartoon mascot and may contain a toy or prize.

Between 1970 and 1998, the number of different types of breakfast cereals in the U.S. more than doubled, from about 160 to around 340; , there were roughly 5,000 different types (estimate based on the mass customization of online shopping). In this highly competitive market, cereal companies have developed an ever-increasing number of varieties and flavors (some are flavored like dessert or candy). Although many plain wheat-, oat- and corn-based cereals exist, a great many other varieties are highly sweetened, and some brands include freeze-dried fruit as a sweet element. The breakfast cereal industry has gross profit margins of 40–45%, In 2009, market researchers expected the market to grow at a CAGR of 7.4% (in the next 5 years); it has had steady and continued growth throughout its history.

==Background==
Cereal grains, namely porridge (and especially oatmeal), became an important breakfast component in North America. Barley was a commonly used grain, though other grains and yellow peas could be used. In many modern cultures, porridge is still eaten as a breakfast dish.

===Early America===
Native Americans had found a way to make ground corn palatable, later called &quot;grits&quot; (from the Old English word &quot;grēot&quot;, meaning &quot;gravel&quot;). &quot;Hominy&quot; was another preparation. While this became a staple in the southern U.S., grits never gained popularity in the northern states. Food reformers in the 19th century called for cutting back on excessive meat consumption at breakfast. They explored numerous vegetarian alternatives. Late in the century, the Seventh-day Adventists based in Michigan made these food reforms part of their religion, and non-meat breakfasts were featured in their sanitariums and led to new breakfast cereals.

===Cooked oatmeal===
Ferdinand Schumacher, a German immigrant, began the cereals revolution in 1854 with a hand oats grinder in the back room of a small store in Akron, Ohio. His German Mills American Oatmeal Company was the nation&#x27;s first commercial oatmeal manufacturer. He marketed the product locally as a substitute for breakfast pork. Improved production technology (steel cutters, porcelain rollers, improved hullers), combined with an influx of German and Irish immigrants, quickly boosted sales and profits.
In 1877, Schumacher adopted the Quaker symbol, the first registered trademark for a breakfast cereal. The acceptance of &quot;horse food&quot; for human consumption encouraged other entrepreneurs to enter the industry. Henry Parsons Crowell started operations in 1882, and John Robert Stuart in 1885. Crowell cut costs by consolidating every step of the processing—grading, cleaning, hulling, cutting, rolling, packaging, and shipping—in one factory operating at Ravenna, Ohio. Stuart operated mills in Chicago and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Stuart and Crowell combined in 1885 and initiated a price war. After a fire at his mill in Akron, Schumacher joined Stuart and Crowell to form the Consolidated Oatmeal Company.

The American Cereal Company (Quaker Oats, but see below) created a cereal made from oats in 1877, manufacturing the product in Akron, Ohio. Separately, in 1888, a trust or holding company combined the nation&#x27;s seven largest mills into the American Cereal Company using the Quaker Oats brand name. By 1900, technology, entrepreneurship, and the &quot;Man in Quaker Garb&quot;—a symbol of plain honesty and reliability—gave Quaker Oats a national market and annual sales of $10 million (equivalent to $ million today).

Early in the 20th century, the Quaker Oats Company (formed in 1901 to replace the American Cereal Company) ventured into the world market. Schumacher, the innovator; Stuart, the manager and financial leader; and Crowell, the creative merchandiser, advertiser, and promoter, doubled sales every decade. Alexander P. Anderson&#x27;s steam-pressure method of shooting rice from guns created puffed rice and puffed wheat. Crowell&#x27;s intensive advertising campaign in the 1920s and 1930s featured promotions with such celebrities as Babe Ruth, Max Baer, and Shirley Temple. Sponsorship of the popular &quot;Rin-Tin-Tin&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot; radio shows aided the company&#x27;s expansion during the depression. Meat rationing during World War II boosted annual sales to $90 million (equivalent to $ billion today), and by 1956 sales topped $277 million ($ billion today). By 1964 the firm sold over 200 products, grossed over $500 million ($ billion today), and claimed that eight million people ate Quaker Oats each day. Expansion included the acquisition of Aunt Jemima Mills Company in 1926, which continues as a leading brand of pancake mixes and syrup, the sport drink Gatorade in 1983, and in 1986, the Golden Grain Company, producers of Rice-A-Roni canned lunch food. In 2001 Quaker Oats was itself bought out by PepsiCo.

==History==
===Early developments===
The first cold breakfast cereal, Granula (not to be confused with granola), was invented in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson, operator of Our Home on the Hillside which was later replaced by the Jackson Sanatorium in Dansville, New York. The cereal never became popular, due to the inconvenient necessity of tenderizing the heavy bran and graham nuggets by soaking them overnight.

George H. Hoyt created Wheatena circa 1879, during an era when retailers would typically buy cereal (the most popular being cracked wheat, oatmeal, and cerealine) in barrel lots, and scoop it out to sell by the pound to customers. Hoyt, who had found a distinctive process of preparing wheat for cereal, sold his cereal in boxes, offering consumers a more sanitary and consumer-friendly option.

===Kellogg and Battle Creek, Michigan===

Packaged breakfast cereals were considerably more convenient than a product that had to be cooked, and as a result of this convenience (and clever marketing), they became popular. Battle Creek, Michigan, was a center both of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and of innovation in the ready-to-eat cereal industry, and indeed, the church had a substantial impact on the development of cereal goods through the person of John Harvey Kellogg (1851–1943). Son of an Adventist factory owner in Battle Creek, Kellogg was encouraged by his church to train in medicine at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City in 1875. After graduating, he became medical superintendent at the Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek, established in 1866 by the Adventists to offer their natural remedies for illness. Many wealthy industrialists came to Kellogg&#x27;s sanitarium for recuperation and rejuvenation.

In Battle Creek sanitarium guests found fresh air, exercise, rest, hydrotherapy, a strict vegetarian diet, and abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and tea. (They were accustomed to breakfasts of ham, eggs, sausages, fried potatoes, hot biscuits, hotcakes (pancakes), and coffee.) To supplement the center&#x27;s vegetarian regimen, Kellogg experimented with granola. Soon afterwards he began to experiment with wheat, resulting in a lighter, flakier product. In 1891 he acquired a patent and then in 1895 he launched the Cornflakes brand, which overnight captured a national market. Soon there were forty rival manufacturers in the Battle Creek area. His brother William K. Kellogg (1860–1951) worked for him for many years until, in 1906, he broke away, bought the rights to Cornflakes, and set up the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company. William Kellogg discarded the health food concept, opting for heavy advertising and commercial taste appeal. Later, his signature on every package became the company trademark.

===Charles W. Post===

The second major innovator in the cereal industry was Charles W. Post, a salesman who was admitted to Kellogg&#x27;s sanitarium as a patient in the late 1800s. While there, he grew deeply impressed with their all-grain diet. Upon his release, he began experimenting with grain products, beginning with an all-grain coffee substitute called Postum. In 1897 (or 1898) he introduced Grape-nuts, the concentrated cereal with a nutty flavor (containing neither grapes nor nuts). Good business sense, determination, and powerful advertising produced a multimillion-dollar fortune for Post in a few years. After his death, his company acquired the Jell-O company in 1925, Baker&#x27;s Chocolate in 1927, Maxwell House coffee in 1928, and Birdseye frozen foods in 1929. In 1929, the company changed its name to General Foods. In 1985, Philip Morris Tobacco Company bought General Foods for $5.6 billion (equivalent to $ billion today) and merged it with its Kraft division. Because of Kellogg and Post, the city of Battle Creek, Michigan, is nicknamed the &quot;Cereal Capital of the World&quot;.

===Muesli===

Muesli is a breakfast cereal based on uncooked rolled oats, fruit, and nuts. It was developed around 1900 by the Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital. It is available in a packaged dry form such as Alpen or Familia Swiss Müesli, or it can be made fresh.

===United Kingdom===

In 1902, Force wheat flakes became the first ready-to-eat breakfast cereal introduced into the United Kingdom. The cereal, and the Sunny Jim character, achieved wide success in Britain, at its peak in 1930 selling 12.5 million packages in one year.

===National advertising===

Kellogg began the breakfast cereal marketing and introduced the first in-box prize in the early 1900s. Quaker Oats entered the market with Puffed Rice and Wheat Berries it had introduced at the 1904 World Fair, with raw grains shot with hot compressed air from tubes, popping up to many times their size. They were marketed as a revolution in food science. In the 1920s, national advertising in magazines and radio broadcasts played a key role in the emergence of the fourth big cereal manufacturer, General Mills. In 1921, James Ford Bell, president of a Minneapolis wheat milling firm, began experimenting with rolled wheat flakes. After tempering, steaming, cracking wheat, and processing it with syrup, sugar, and salt, it was prepared in a pressure cooker for rolling and then dried in an electric oven. By 1925, Wheaties had become the &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;. In 1928, four milling companies consolidated as the General Mills Company in Minneapolis. The new firm expanded packaged food sales with heavy advertising, including sponsorship of radio programs such as &quot;Skippy&quot;, &quot;Jack Armstrong, The All-American Boy&quot;, and baseball games. Jack Dempsey, Johnny Weissmuller, and others verified the &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; slogan. By 1941 Wheaties had won 12% percent of the cereal market. Experiments with the puffing process produced Kix, a puffed corn cereal, and Cheerios, a puffed oats cereal. Further product innovation and diversification brought total General Mills sales to over $500 million annually (18% in packaged foods) by the early 1950s. In 1944 General Foods launched a marketing campaign for Grape Nuts, focusing on nutritional importance of breakfast.

===Sugar cereals===

After World War II, the big breakfast cereal companies—now including General Mills, who entered the market in 1924 with Wheaties—increasingly started to target children. The flour was refined to remove fiber, which at the time was considered to undermine digestion and absorption of nutrients, and sugar was added to improve the flavor for children. The new breakfast cereals began to look starkly different from their ancestors. Ranger Joe, the first pre-sweetened breakfast cereal of sugar-coated puffed wheat or rice, was introduced in the US in 1939. Kellogg&#x27;s Sugar Smacks, created in 1953, had 56% sugar by weight. Different mascots were introduced, such as the Rice Krispies elves and later pop icons like Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit.

A January 2025 study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine examined cereal purchases from 77,000 U.S. households over nine years alongside Nielsen ratings data on advertising exposure. The study found that ads targeting adults had negligible impact, while those aimed at children strongly correlated with increased purchases of sugary cereals in households with kids. Nine cereals, each with 9 to 12 grams of sugar per serving, dominated the market, accounting for 41% of total cereal bought.

=== Granola ===

In the 1960s, the modern version of granola was invented and popularized. It evolved from a product called Granula (similar to Grape Nuts) to the recognizable modern form involving at a minimum: sweetened toasted oats, but also possibly: dried fruit, puffed rice, nuts or chocolate.

===Modern cereal===

Over 2016 to 2017, Americans purchased 3.1 billion boxes of cereal, mostly as ready to eat cold cereal. In a $9.8 billion cereal market, cold cereal purchases were 88% of the total (12% for hot cereals), with the overall cereal market declining due to reduced consumption of sugar and dairy products. Kellogg&#x27;s and General Mills each had 30% of the market share for cold cereals. Honey Nut Cheerios was the leading cold cereal.

==Processing of grains==
The processing of grains helps to separate the bran and cereal germ, but may remove nutrients, such as B vitamins and dietary fiber. Processing is the modification of a grain or mixture of grains usually taking place in a facility remote from the location where the product is eaten. This distinguishes &quot;breakfast cereals&quot; from foods made from grains modified and cooked in the place where they are eaten.

=== Nutritional fortification ===
Breakfast cereals may be fortified with dietary minerals and vitamins. For example, breakfast cereal in Canada may be fortified with specific micronutrient amounts per 100 grams of cereal, including thiamin, (2.0 mg), niacin (4.8 mg), and vitamin B6 (0.6 mg), among others.

==Gluten-free cereals==
Breakfast cereal companies make gluten-free cereals which are free of any gluten-containing grains. These cereals are targeted for consumers who suffer from gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy, among others. Some companies that produce gluten-free cereals include Kellogg&#x27;s, General Mills, Nature&#x27;s Path and Arrowhead Mills.

==Warm cereals==
Most warm cereals can be classified as porridges, in that they consist of cereal grains which are soaked in hot water, cooked and/or boiled to soften them and make them palatable. Sweeteners, such as brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup, are often added either by the manufacturer, during cooking, or before eating. Porridge is especially popular in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and England. Porridge became important in Scotland due to the freezing winters. The Scottish people prefer porridge to be made with only water and salt while other prefer creamier substances to be added. Wales had a perfect climate for cultivating oats making porridge common in Welsh households. Ireland mixes porridge with whiskey as a cure for the common cold while England references the dish to the royal family and their traditions.

===Canada===
Common hot cereals in parts of Canada include oatmeal, Cream of Wheat (and Cream of Rice) and Red River cereal. These hot cereals are typically served with maple syrup or brown sugar and milk or cream. Yogurt is also added to Red River cereal. Many Canadians also enjoy cereals similar to those in the United States market.

===China===
In China, porridges such as rice congee, or those made with other ingredients (including corn meal or millet) are often eaten for breakfast. Eating breakfast cereal has become more important in China and specifically Hong Kong due to the increase of work and decrease in time.

===Greece===
In Greece, cornmeal is poured into boiling milk to create a cereal of a thick consistency which is often served to young children. The cereal production in Greece has recently declined.

===Ireland===

Oatmeal is a common breakfast in Ireland. Oatmeal and porridge have been consumed in Ireland since the 19th century.

===Russia===
In Russia, a breakfast is kasha, a porridge of buckwheat (), farina (), or other grains. Kasha is found throughout much of Eastern Europe including Croatia, with analogous dishes existing in many wealthier, Westernized cuisines of Central Europe, such as Poland and Slovakia, where they are associated primarily with lower socioeconomic status. Russia does not value breakfast cereals as much as other places. Most instances of cereal consumption is due to the desire for weight loss.

===South Africa===
Pap is a porridge used in a variety of meals eaten throughout the day. In the Afrikaans culture of descendants of Dutch farmers and French Huguenots, it is usually sprinkled with sugar and then eaten with milk; it can be made to a very stiff consistency so that it forms—what could be described as—a softish lumpy crumble (called &quot;krummel-pap&quot;) or a more creamy porridge consistency (called &quot;slap-pap&quot;). It is generally made from maize (&quot;mielie&quot;) meal and is sold under various brand names. Taystee Wheat is made into a creamy wheat-based porridge. Porridge brands unique to South Africa include Jungle Oats and Bokomo Maltabella (made from malted sorghum). In other parts of Africa it is known as &quot;ugali&quot;, &quot;bota&quot;, and &quot;banku&quot; or &quot;makkau&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
Scotland is famous for its consumption of oats. In Northern Ireland, the company White&#x27;s has been milling oats in Tandragee since 1841. England has incorporated porridge in their culture for centuries. Many of the different types of porridge were made specially for the royal family including a type of porridge called &quot;pea porridge&quot;. This specific dish was made for King Richard II.

==Research==

Consumption of breakfast cereal is under preliminary research for the potential to improve nutrition and affect chronic diseases.
Regular breakfast cereal consumption is associated with less risk of being overweight or obese and high-fiber breakfast cereals are associated with a lower risk of diabetes.

<doc id="82778" wikidata="Q827401" url="?curid=82778" title="Teatro Colón">
<text>The Teatro Colón () is a historic opera house in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is considered one of the ten best opera houses in the world by National Geographic. According to a survey carried out by the acoustics expert Leo Beranek among leading international opera and orchestra directors, the Teatro Colón has the room with the best acoustics for opera and the second best for concerts in the world.

The present Colón replaced an original theatre which opened in 1857. Towards the end of the century, it became clear that a new theatre was needed, and after a 20-year process, the present theatre opened on 25 May 1908, with Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aïda&quot;.

The Teatro Colón was visited by the foremost singers and opera companies of the time, who would sometimes go on to other cities including Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

After this period of huge international success, the theatre&#x27;s decline became clear and plans were made for massive renovations. After an initial start of works to restore the landmark in 2005, the theatre was closed for refurbishment from October 2006 to May 2010. It re-opened on 24 May 2010, with a programme for the 2010 season.

The theatre was declared a National Historic Monument in 1991.

==History==

The Colón theater operated in two buildings, the first located in the Plaza de Mayo until 1888 and the second located in front of the Plaza Lavalle, which took 20 years to be built until its inauguration in 1908. This land formerly housed the Park Station, the first railway station of the Argentine Republic as head of the Western Railway of Buenos Aires.
Throughout its history the main figures of opera, classical music and world ballet have performed in the Colón theater, such as Arturo Toscanini, Vaslav Nijinsky, Luisa Tetrazzini, Enrico Caruso, Conchita Supervia, Regina Pacini, Anna Pavlova, Maya Plisetskaya, Margot Fonteyn, Mikhail Barishnikov, Antonio Gades, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Camille Saint-Saens, Manuel de Falla, Aaron Copland, Herbert von Karajan, Leonard Bernstein, Mstislav Rostropovich, Zubin Mehta, Maria Callas, Renata Tebaldi, Leontyne Price, Ana Serrano Redonnet, Celia Torra, Yehudi Menuhin, Pau Casals, Rudolf Nureyev, Maurice Béjart, Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, Luciano Pavarotti, Lily Pons, Marina de Gabaráin, Victoria de los Ángeles, Reri Grist, Montserrat Caballé, Kiri Te Kanawa, among others, and Argentine artists such as Adelaida Negri, Héctor Panizza, Alberto Ginastera, Jorge Donn, Norma Fontenla, José Neglia, Olga Ferri, Julio Bocca, Maximiliano Guerra, Paloma Herrera, Daniel Barenboim, Martha Argerich, Astor Piazzolla, Aníbal Troilo and Osvaldo Pugliese. In the last decade other popular artists such as Chris Cornell, Katherine Jenkins, Sarah Brightman, Joss Stone, Branford Marsalis, play here.

Among the main events of its history are the creation of stable bodies in the 1920s and its municipalisation in 1931. In 1946, Peronism promoted a policy of openness to popular music and greater democratisation of the public, which was reverted after its overthrow in 1955 and again resumed when democracy recovered in 1983.

In 2006 a full restoration work was started that would extend until 2010, when it was reopened on May 24 in commemoration of the Bicentennial of Argentina.

==The first Teatro Colón==
The first Teatro Colón was designed by Charles Pellegrini, and proved to be a successful venue for over 30 years, with 2,500 seats with the inclusion of a separate gallery reserved only for people who were in mourning. The construction started in 1856 and completed in 1857. This was celebrated with an opening on 27 April 1857, with Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;, just four years after its Italian premiere. The production starred Sofia Vera Lorini as Violetta and Enrico Tamberlik as Alfredo.

This theater was closed on 13 September 1888 to step aside for a new improved building, which was opened twenty years later on Libertad street, overlooking Plaza Lavalle. In that period of time, the 1890 crisis and its effects were the cause for the delay in the completion of this second theater.

Before the construction of the current Teatro Colón, opera performances were given in several theatres, of which the first Teatro Colón and the Teatro Opera were the most important. The principal company that performed at the Teatro Opera moved to the Teatro Colón in 1908. However, major companies also performed at the Teatro Politeama and the Teatro Coliseo which opened in 1907.

==The present Teatro Colón==
===Characteristics===
The theatre is bounded by the wide 9 de Julio Avenue (technically Cerrito Street), Libertad Street (the main entrance), Arturo Toscanini Street, and Tucumán Street. It is in the heart of the city on a site once occupied by Ferrocarril Oeste&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Parque&quot; station.

The auditorium is horseshoe-shaped, has 2,487 seats (slightly more than the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London), standing room for 1,000 and a stage which is 20 m wide, 15 m high and 20 m deep. The low-rise building has 6 floors above ground and 3 below ground, 7 elevators with a facade of applied masonry. It has a large central chandelier with 700 light bulbs. The original architect was the Italian Francesco Tamburini; after his death it was completed by the Belgian architect Julio Dormal. The original auditorium &quot;had eight boxes with metal grilles and a separate entrance, so that those in mourning could still attend performances, but remain dignifiedly sequestered from public view&quot;.

The Colon&#x27;s acoustics are considered to be so good as to place it in the top five performance venues in the world. Luciano Pavarotti held a similar opinion.

===Opening and subsequent history===
The present theatre, the second with that name, opened on 25 May 1908, after twenty years under construction, and was inaugurated with &quot;Aida&quot; by the Italian company directed by Luigi Mancinelli and tenor Amedeo Bassi, soprano Lucia Crestani (as Aida). The second presentation was Thomas&#x27; &quot;Hamlet&quot; with the baritone Titta Ruffo During the inaugural season seventeen operas were performed with famous stars such as Ruffo, Feodor Chaliapin in Boito&#x27;s &quot;Mefistofele&quot;, Antonio Paoli in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;.

The cornerstone of the present Teatro Colón was laid in 1889 under the direction of architect Francesco Tamburini and his pupil, Vittorio Meano, who designed a theatre in the Italian style on a scale and with amenities which matched those in Europe. However, delays followed due to financial difficulties, arguments regarding the location, the death of Tamburini in 1891, the murder of Meano in 1904 and the death of Angelo Ferrari, an Italian businessman who was financing the new theatre. The building was finally completed in 1908 under the direction of the Belgian architect Julio Dormal who made some changes in the structure and left his mark in the French style of the decoration. The bas-reliefs and busts on the facade are the work of sculptor Luigi Trinchero.

The theatre&#x27;s opening on 25 May, the &quot;Día de la Patria&quot; in Argentina, featured a performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and it quickly became a world-famous operatic venue rivaling La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in attracting most of the world&#x27;s best opera singers and conductors.

The Teatro was bombed by anarchists in 1910; Georges Clemenceau was present in Argentina during the attack. The bomb landed in the middle of the orchestra. Clemenceau describes the attack as follows: &quot;The horror can not be exaggerated. A senior official told me that he had never seen such puddles of blood. The wounded were carried off as best as possible, and the room was emptied by the cries of fury, and the material damage repaired during the day which followed, not a woman of society missed the representation of the morrow. It is a fine trait of character that particularly honours the female element of the Argentine nation. I am not quite sure that in Paris the hall would have been full in such cases.&quot;

Ballet stars performed at the Colón alongside Argentine dancers and classical instrumentalists. This included the prima ballerina, Lida Martinoli. When she retired from dancing, Martinoli began to choreograph. She died in Santa Fe. The tragic 1971 aviation death of two of the best known of these, Norma Fontenla and José Neglia, was commemorated with a monument in neighbouring Lavalle Square.

With excellent acoustics and modern stage areas, the theatre&#x27;s interior design features a rich scarlet and gold decor. The cupola contains canvas painted in 1966 by the 20th-century artist Raúl Soldi during renovation work.
===Refurbishment (2005–2010)===
In recent years, given the political and economic circumstances of Argentina, the Teatro Colón has suffered considerably, but a period of slow recovery began. The theatre underwent massive phased remodelling of both interior and exterior, initially while the house was still open, but production activities ceased at the end of December 2006 to allow full refurbishment.

Initially, &quot;what had been planned as an 18-month, $25-million renovation with 500 workers, scheduled for a May 2008 reopening with &quot;Aida&quot;, became a three-year $100-million extravaganza with 1,500 workers including 130 professional architects and engineers.&quot; In addition, an exterior open-air stage was planned for an opening in 2011. In all, underwent updating, both inside and out.

Some of the last performances immediately before closure of the theatre&#x27;s building were &quot;Swan Lake&quot; on 30 September with the Ballet Estable del Teatro Colón and the Buenos Aires Philharmonic (&quot;Orquesta Filarmónica de Buenos Aires&quot;). and, on 28 October, the opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; was given featuring Orquesta Estable del Teatro Colón and the house chorus.

The theatre&#x27;s final performance before its closure for refurbishment works in 2005 was a concert on 1 November starring folklore singer Mercedes Sosa in performance with the Argentine National Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Pedro Ignacio Calderón.

While it was originally planned to reopen in time for the centenary on 25 May 2008, delays prevented this, and the house was finally reopened with a gala concert and 3D animations on 24 May 2010, the eve of its own 102nd birthday and the Argentina Bicentennial. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot; and Act 2 of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; were performed. A private concert to test the acoustics attended by employees, architects, and others involved in the renovation occurred on 6 May 2010. On the 6 September 2013, the Teatro Colón hosted the Opening Ceremony of the 125th Session of the International Olympic Committee.

<doc id="82779" wikidata="Q545360" url="?curid=82779" title="Graceland">
<text>Graceland is a mansion on a estate in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, once owned by American singer Elvis Presley. Presley is buried there, as are his parents Vernon and Gladys, paternal grandmother Minnie Mae, grandson Benjamin, and daughter Lisa Marie. 

Graceland is located at 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard in the Whitehaven neighborhood, about south of central Memphis and fewer than north of the Mississippi border. It was opened to the public as a house museum on June 7, 1982, and attracts more than 650,000 visitors annually.

Graceland was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1991, becoming the first site recognized for significance related to rock music. It was declared a National Historic Landmark on March 27, 2006, also a first for such a site.

Elvis&#x27; father, Vernon, first inherited Graceland after Elvis&#x27; death on August 16, 1977. Lisa Marie Presley inherited Graceland after she turned 25 years old. Following Lisa Marie&#x27;s death on January 12, 2023, her eldest daughter, Riley Keough, became the sole trustee and owner. In May 2024, a company called Naussany Investments &amp; Private Lending LLC claimed that Lisa Marie Presley had failed to pay back $3.8 million it had loaned her. A Tennessee court ruled that the mysterious company likely committed fraud through forged documents, and that neither Priscilla nor Riley authorized such a foreclosure.

== History ==
Graceland Farms was originally owned by Stephen C. Toof, founder of S.C. Toof &amp; Co., the oldest commercial printing firm in Memphis. He worked previously as the pressroom foreman of the Memphis newspaper, the &quot;Memphis Daily Appeal&quot;. The site (before the mansion was built in 1939) was named after Toof&#x27;s daughter, Grace. She inherited the property from her father in 1894. After her death, the property passed to her niece Ruth Moore, a Memphis socialite. Together with her husband, Thomas Moore, Ruth Moore commissioned construction of a Colonial Revival style mansion in 1939. The house was designed by architects Furbringer and Ehrman.
After Elvis Presley began his musical career, he purchased a $40,000 home for himself and his family at 1034 Audubon Drive in Memphis in 1956. As his success and fame grew, especially after his appearances on television, the number of fans who would congregate outside the house increased. Presley&#x27;s neighbors, although happy to have a celebrity living nearby, concluded that the constant gathering of fans and journalists was a nuisance.

In early 1957, Presley gave his parents, Vernon and Gladys Presley, a budget of $100,000 and asked them to find a &quot;farmhouse&quot;-like property to purchase, with buffer space around it. At the time, Graceland was located in southern Shelby County, several miles south of Memphis&#x27;s main urban area. In later years, Memphis expanded with residential developments, resulting in Graceland being surrounded by other properties. Presley purchased Graceland on March 19, 1957, for a price of $102,500.

Later that year, Presley invited Richard Williams and singer Buzz Cason to the house. Cason said: &quot;We proceeded to clown around on the front porch, striking our best rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll poses and snapping pictures with the little camera. We peeked in the not-yet-curtained windows and got a kick out of the pastel colored walls in the front rooms with shades of bright reds and purples that Elvis most certainly had picked out.&quot; Presley was fond of claiming that the US government had mooted a visit to Graceland by Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, &quot;to see how in America a fellow can start out with nothing and, you know, make good.&quot;

After Gladys died in 1958 aged 46, Presley&#x27;s father Vernon married Dee Stanley in 1960, and the couple lived at Graceland for a time. There was some discord between Presley and his stepmother Dee at Graceland, however. Elaine Dundy, who wrote about Presley and his mother, said that
Vernon had settled down with Dee where Gladys had once reigned, while Dee herself – when Elvis was away – had taken over the role of mistress of Graceland so thoroughly as to rearrange the furniture and replace the very curtains that Gladys had approved of.&quot; This was too much for Presley, who still loved his late mother deeply. One afternoon, &quot;a van arrived ... and all Dee&#x27;s household&#x27;s goods, clothes, &#x27;improvements,&#x27; and her own menagerie of pets, were loaded on ... while Vernon, Dee and her three children went by car to a nearby house on Hermitage until they finally settled into a house on Dolan Drive which ran alongside Elvis&#x27;s estate.

According to Mark Crispin Miller, Graceland became for Presley &quot;the home of the organization that was himself, was tended by a large vague clan of Presleys and deputy Presleys, each squandering the vast gratuities which Elvis used to keep his whole world smiling.&quot; The author adds that Presley&#x27;s father Vernon &quot;had a swimming pool in his bedroom&quot;, that there &quot;was a jukebox next to the swimming pool, containing Elvis&#x27;s favorite records&quot;, and that, he &quot;would spend hours in his bedroom, watching his property on a closed-circuit television&quot;. According to Presley&#x27;s cousin, Billy Smith, Presley slept at Graceland with Smith and his wife Jo many times: &quot;we were all three there talking for hours about everything in the world! Sometimes he would have a bad dream and come looking for me to talk to, and he would actually fall asleep in our bed with us.&quot;

Priscilla Presley and Elvis married in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 1, 1967. Their daughter Lisa Marie Presley was born on February 1, 1968, and lived the first years of her life on the estate. After her parents divorced in 1972, her mother moved with Lisa to California. Every year around Christmas, Lisa Marie Presley and all her family would go to Graceland to celebrate Christmas together. Lisa Marie often returned to Graceland for visits.

When Elvis toured, staying in hotels, &quot;the rooms would be remodeled in advance of his arrival, so as to make the same configurations of space as he had at home – the Graceland mansion. His furniture would arrive, and he could unwind after his performances in surroundings which were completely familiar and comforting.&quot; &#x27;The Jungle Room&#x27; was described as being &quot;an example of particularly lurid kitsch.&quot;
On August 16, 1977, Presley died aged 42 in his bathroom at Graceland. The official cause of death was cardiac arrhythmia, although later toxicology reports strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death; &quot;fourteen drugs were found in Elvis&#x27;s system, with several drugs such as codeine in significant quantities. Presley lay in repose in a , copper-lined coffin just inside the foyer; more than 3,500 of his mourning fans passed by to pay their respects. A private funeral with 200 mourners was held on August 18, 1977, in the house, with the casket placed in front of the stained glass doorway of the music room. Graceland continued to be occupied by members of the family until the death of Presley&#x27;s aunt Delta in 1993, who had moved in at Elvis&#x27;s invitation after her husband&#x27;s death.
Elvis&#x27;s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, inherited the estate in 1993 when she turned 25.

Presley&#x27;s grave, along with those of his parents Gladys and Vernon Presley, his grandmother Minnie Mae Presley, Elvis&#x27;s daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, and his grandson Benjamin Keough are located in the Meditation Garden next to the mansion. They can be visited during the mansion tours or for free before the mansion tours begin. A memorial gravestone for Presley&#x27;s stillborn twin brother, Jesse Garon, is also at the site.

In 2019, the owners of Graceland threatened to leave Memphis unless the city provided tax incentives. The Memphis City Council subsequently voted on a deal to help fund a $100 million expansion of Graceland.

=== Attempted foreclosure ===
The property was slated for a foreclosure sale in May 2024. A company alleged that Lisa Marie Presley put the home up as security on a $3.8million loan in 2018. Riley Keough claimed the documents underlying the foreclosure are fraudulent and sued to stop the sale. Elvis Presley Enterprises, which manages the rest of the Presley estate, concurred with Keough&#x27;s claims. In a hearing on May 22, JoeDae Jenkins of the Shelby County Chancery Court declared the lender&#x27;s claims as invalid. No representative for the lender appeared at the hearing. The lender subsequently dropped plans to go ahead with the foreclosure without addressing Chancellor Jenkins&#x27; allegations. NBC News tried without success to find Naussany Investments &amp; Private Lending and its representative, Gregory E. Naussany, in public records. A real estate professor at the University of Memphis has said, &quot;[I]f this had been someone else&#x27;s inheritance, someone else&#x27;s home, it would just be another example [of real estate fraud] that the public never hears about.&quot; 

A ring of identity thieves based in Nigeria has claimed to be behind the scheme. Speaking to the &quot;New York Times&quot; via email which was written in Luganda, a ring leader of this group stated that the organization which he belonged to had a network of “worms” placed throughout the United States and would, among other things, prey on the dead. Naussany Investments &amp; Private Lending LLC would, in fact, file the legal claim which alleged Lisa Marie Presley owed them $2.8million in a California probate court in September 2023, eight months after her death. The &quot;Times&quot; would also concede that it was difficult to find evidence that Naussany Investments &amp; Private Lending LLC was even an existing company.

On August 16, 2024, Missouri woman Lisa Jeanine Findley, who is also known by Lisa Holden and many other aliases, was arrested. The U.S. Department of Justice charged Findley with identity theft and mail fraud connected to the attempt to extort the Elvis Presley family into selling Graceland. Findley would make an appearance in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri on August 16, 2024 in a hearing that lasted seven minutes. During her arraignment, Findley waived her right to a preliminary hearing or detention hearing and agreed to have those hearings take place in the prosecuting court, the Western District of Tennessee. The U.S. government moved for detention, and Findley was ordered to be removed to the Western District of Tennessee. She remains in custody. On January 25, 2025, Findley pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, and will be sentenced on June 19.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Public Affairs, Findley &quot;posed as three different individuals&quot; affiliated with the &quot;fictitious private lender&quot; in order to falsely accuse the late Lisa Marie of borrowing $3.8 million from Naussany Investments in 2018. Findley also &quot;allegedly fabricated loan documents&quot; on which she &quot;forged the signatures of Elvis Presley’s daughter and a Florida State notary public. Findley then allegedly filed a false creditor’s claim with the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles, and a fake deed of trust with the Shelby County Register’s Office in Memphis&quot; and was, in fact, the one who &quot;allegedly published a fraudulent foreclosure notice.&quot; Despite Findley&#x27;s direct role, a Graceland official claimed to celebrity news site &quot;The Blast&quot; that Graceland did not believe Findley was the scam&#x27;s mastermind, stating that &quot;We think this is the first domino to fall, not the last. We do not believe this is the mastermind behind the scam.&quot; Prosecutors have also stated that the person responsible for the scheme was an identity thief based in Nigeria. At the time of Findley&#x27;s arrest, it was acknowledged that Kimberly L. Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name Findley forged, had, in fact, sided with Riley Keough in her lawsuit against Naussany Investments. In an affidavit, Philbrick stated that “I have never met Lisa Marie Presley, nor have I ever notarized a document signed by Lisa Marie Presley” and that “I do not know why my signature appears on this document.” Findley was also confirmed to have had history of similar criminal cases in the state of Oklahoma, which led to numerous arrests and her serving prison time in both Oklahoma and a Texas federal prison.

== Architecture ==
=== Exterior ===
Constructed at the top of a hill and surrounded by rolling pastures and a grove of oak trees, Graceland was designed by the Memphis architectural firm, Furbringer and Erhmanis. It&#x27;s a two-story, five-bay residence in the Colonial Revival style, with a side-facing gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, a central two-story projecting pedimented portico, and two one-story wings on the north and south sides. Attached to the wing is an additional one-story stuccoed wing, which was originally a garage that houses up to four cars. The mansion has two chimneys; one on the north side&#x27;s exterior wall, the second rising through the south side&#x27;s roof ridge. The central block&#x27;s front and side facades are veneered with tan Tishomingo limestone from Mississippi and its rear wall is stuccoed, as are the one-story wings. The front facade fenestration on the first floor includes 9x9 double-hung windows set in arched openings with wooden panels above, and 6x6 double-hung windows on the second floor.

Flanked by two marble lions, four stone steps ascend from the driveway to the two-story central projecting pedimented portico. The pediment has dentils and a small, leaded oval window in the center while the portico contains four Corinthian columns with capitals modeled after architect James Stuart&#x27;s conjectural porticos for the &quot;Tower of the Winds&quot; in Athens, Greece. The portico&#x27;s cornered columns are matched by pilasters on the front facade. The doorway has a broken arched pediment, full entablature, and engaged columns while its transom and sidelights contain elaborate and colorful stained glass. And above the main entrance is another rectangular window, completed with a shallow iron balcony.

=== Interior ===

==== First floor ====

Graceland is and has a total of 23 rooms, including eight bedrooms and bathrooms. To the right of the Entrance Hall, through an elliptical-arched opening with classical details, is the Living Room. The Living Room contains a white couch against the wall overlooking the front yard. To the left are two white sofas, a china cabinet and a fireplace with a mirrored wall. The painting that hangs in the room was Elvis&#x27;s last Christmas present from his father, Vernon, and also displayed are photographs of Elvis&#x27;s parents Vernon and Gladys, Elvis and Lisa Marie. Behind an adjoined doorway is the Music Room, framed by vivid large peacocks set in stained glass and contains a black baby grand piano and a 1950s style TV. And the third adjacent room is a bedroom that was occupied by Elvis&#x27;s parents. The walls, carpet, dresser, and queen size bed are bright white with the bed draped in a velvet-looking dark purple bedspread along with an en-suite full bathroom done in pink.

To the left of the Entrance Hall, mirroring the Living Room, is the Dining Room, headlined by a massive crystal chandelier. It features six plush chairs in golden metal frames set around a marble table, all of which are placed on black marble flooring in the center with carpet around the perimeter. Connected to the Dining Room is the Kitchen, which was used by Elvis&#x27;s aunt Delta until her death in 1993 before it was opened to the public two years later.

The original one-story wing on the north end of the residence includes a mechanical room, bedroom, and bath. In the mid-1960s, Presley enlarged the house to create a den known as the Jungle Room which features an indoor waterfall of cut field stone on the north wall. The room also contains items both related to and imported from the state of Hawaii because, after starring in the tropical film &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot; (1961), the musician wanted to bring some memorabilia from The Aloha State to his mansion, which gives visitors the same feeling. In 1976, the Jungle Room was converted into a recording studio, where he recorded the bulk of his final two albums, &quot;From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee&quot; (1976) and &quot;Moody Blue&quot; (1977); these were his final known recordings in a studio setting. During the mid-1960s expansion of the house, Presley constructed a large wing on the south side of the main house that was a sidewalk, between the music room in the original one-story wing and the swimming pool area, that connected to the house by a small enclosed gallery. The new wing initially housed a slot car track and to store his many items of appreciation, but was later remodeled to what is now known as the Trophy Building, which now features an exhibit about the Presley family, and includes Priscilla&#x27;s wedding dress, Elvis&#x27;s wedding tuxedo, Lisa Marie&#x27;s toy chest and baby clothes and more.

==== Second floor ====
The Entrance Hall contains a white staircase leading to the house&#x27;s second floor with a wall of mirrors. However, the second floor is not open to visitors, out of respect for the Presley family, and partially to avoid any improper focus on the bathroom which was the site of his death. Still, it features Elvis&#x27;s bedroom at the southwest corner that connects to his dressing room and bathroom in the northwest. His daughter Lisa Marie&#x27;s bedroom is in the northeast corner, and in the southeast is a bedroom that served as a private personal office for the musician. The floor has been untouched since the day Elvis died and is rarely seen by non-family members.

==== Basement ====

Downstairs in the basement is the TV room, where Elvis often watched three television sets at once, and was within close reach of a wet bar. The three TV sets are built into the room&#x27;s south wall and there&#x27;s a stereo, and cabinets for Elvis&#x27;s record collection. Painted on the west wall is The King&#x27;s 1970s logo of a lightning bolt and cloud with the initials TCB, both of which represent &#x27;taking care of business in a flash&#x27;. And the last room in the mansion opposite of the TV room is the billiard room; an avid billiards player, Elvis bought the pool table in 1960 and had the walls and ceiling covered with 350–400 yards of pleated cotton fabric after the two basement rooms were remodeled in 1974. The pool balls are arranged just the way they were in the musician&#x27;s final days, along with a sign that says &quot;PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH, THANK YOU.&quot; And in one corner of the pool table, there&#x27;s a rip in the green felt, which was caused by one of Elvis&#x27;s friends in a failed attempt of a trick shot.

== Criticism ==
Critics such as Albert Goldman write: &quot;Though it cost a lot of money to fill up Graceland with the things that appealed to Elvis Presley, nothing in the house is worth a dime.&quot; In chapter 1 of his book, &quot;Elvis&quot; (1981), the author describes Graceland as looking like a brothel: &quot;it appears to have been lifted from some turn-of-the-century bordello down in the French Quarter of New Orleans. Lulu White or the Countess Willie Piazza might have contrived this plushy parlor for the entertainment of Gyp the Blood. The room is a gaudy mélange of red velour and gilded tassels, Louis XV furniture and porcelain bric-a-brac...&quot; And he dismisses the interior as &quot;bizarre,&quot; &quot;garish&quot; and &quot;phony,&quot; adding that &quot;King Elvis&#x27;s obsession with royal red reaches an intensity that makes you gag.&quot;

In similar terms, Greil Marcus writes that people who visited the inside of Graceland—&quot;people who to a real degree shared Elvis Presley’s class background, and whose lives were formed by his music—have returned with one word to describe what they saw: ‘Tacky.’ Tacky, garish, tasteless—words others translated as white trash.&quot;

According to Karal Ann Marling, Graceland is &quot;a Technicolor illusion. The façade is &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; all the way. The den in the back is &quot;Mogambo&quot; with a hint of &quot;Blue Hawaii&quot;. Living in Graceland was like living on a Hollywood backlot, where patches of tropical scenery alternated with the blackened ruins of antebellum Atlanta. It was like living in a Memphis movie theater... Diehard fans are sometimes disappointed by the formal rooms along the highway side of Graceland. They’re beautiful, in a chilly blue-and-white way, but remote and overarranged.&quot; The Jungle Room&#x27;s &quot;overt bad taste&quot; lets nonbelievers &quot;recoil in horror and imagine themselves a notch or two higher than Elvis on the class scale.&quot;

== Estate ==
After purchasing the property Presley spent in excess of $500,000 carrying out extensive modifications to suit his needs including a pink Alabama fieldstone wall surrounding the grounds that has several years&#x27; worth of graffiti (signatures and messages) from visitors, who simply refer to it as &quot;the wall&quot;. Designed and built by Abe Sauer is the wrought-iron front gate shaped like a book of sheet music, along with green colored musical notes and two mirrored silhouettes of Elvis playing his guitar. Sauer also installed a kidney shaped swimming pool and a racquetball court, which is reminiscent of an old country club, furnished in dark leather and a functional bar. There is a sunken sitting area with the ever-present stereo system found throughout Graceland, as well as the dark brown upright piano upon which Elvis played for what were to be his last songs, Willie Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;.

However, reports conflict about which one was the last song. The sitting area has a floor-to-ceiling shatterproof window designed to watch the many racquetball games that took place there when Elvis was alive. In the early hours of the morning on which Elvis died, he played a game of racquetball with his girlfriend Ginger Alden, his first cousin Billy Smith and Billy&#x27;s wife Jo before ending the game with the song on the piano before walking into the main house to wash his hair and go to bed. Today the two story court has been restored to the way it was when Elvis used the building.

Elsewhere on the estate is a small white building that served as an office for Vernon, along with an old smokehouse that housed a shooting range and a fully functional stable of horses.

One of Presley&#x27;s better known modifications was the addition of the Meditation Garden, designed and built by architect Bernard Grenadier. It was used by the musician to reflect on any problems or situations that arose during his life. It is also where his entire family is buried: himself (1935–1977), his parents Gladys (1912–1958) and Vernon (1916–1979), and grandmother Minnie Mae Hood (1890–1980) while a small stone memorializes his twin brother Jesse Garon, who died at birth thirty minutes before Elvis was born on January 8, 1935. In late 2020, Lisa Marie&#x27;s son Benjamin Keough was laid to rest on the opposite end of the Meditation Garden after his death from suicide in July of that year. Lisa Marie Presley died from sudden cardiac arrest in January 2023 and is buried next to her son.

== Tourist destination ==
After Elvis Presley&#x27;s death in 1977, Vernon Presley served as executor of his estate. Upon his death in 1979, he chose Priscilla to serve as the estate executor for Elvis&#x27;s only child, Lisa Marie, who was only 11. Graceland itself cost $500,000 a year in upkeep, and expenses had dwindled Elvis&#x27;s and Priscilla&#x27;s daughter Lisa Marie&#x27;s inheritance to only $1 million. Taxes were due on the property; those and other expenses due came to over $500,000. Faced with having to sell Graceland, Priscilla examined other famous houses and museums, and hired a CEO, Jack Soden, to turn Graceland into a moneymaker. Graceland was opened to the public on June 7, 1982. Priscilla&#x27;s gamble paid off; after only a month of opening Graceland&#x27;s doors the estate made back all the money it had invested. Priscilla Presley became the chairwoman and president of Elvis Presley Enterprises, or EPE, stating at that time she would do so until Lisa Marie reached 21 years of age. The enterprise&#x27;s fortunes soared and eventually the trust grew to be worth over $100 million.

An annual procession through the estate and past Elvis&#x27;s grave is held on the anniversary of his death. Known as Elvis Week, it includes a full schedule of speakers and events, including the only Elvis Mass at St. Paul&#x27;s Church, the highlight for many Elvis fans of all faiths. The 20th Anniversary in 1997 had several hundred media groups from around the world that were present resulting in the event gaining its greatest media publicity.

One of the largest gatherings assembled on the 25th anniversary in 2002 with one estimate of 40,000 people in attendance, despite the heavy rain. On the 38th anniversary of Elvis&#x27;s death, an estimated 30,000 people attended the Candlelight Vigil during the night of August 15–16, 2015. On the 40th anniversary of Elvis&#x27;s death, on August 15–16, 2017, at least 50,000 fans were expected to attend the Candlelight Vigil. No official figure seems to have been released, maybe because, for the first time, attendees had to pay at least the lowest tour fare, $28.75, to cover the extra security costs due to a larger than usual crowd.

For many of the hundreds of thousands of people who visit Graceland each year, the visit takes on a quasi-religious perspective. They may plan for years to journey to the home of the &#x27;King&#x27; of rock and roll. On site, headphones narrate the salient events of Elvis&#x27;s life and introduce the relics that adorn the rooms and corridors. The rhetorical mode is hagiographic, celebrating the life of an extraordinary man, emphasizing his generosity, his kindness and good fellowship, how he was at once a poor boy who made good, an extraordinary musical talent, a sinner and substance abuser, and a religious man devoted to the Gospel and its music. At the meditation garden, containing Elvis&#x27;s grave, some visitors pray, kneel, or quietly sing one of Elvis&#x27;s favorite hymns. The brick wall that encloses the mansion&#x27;s grounds is covered with graffiti that express an admiration for Presley as well as petitions for help and thanks for favors granted.

The Graceland grounds include a new exhibit complex, Elvis Presley&#x27;s Memphis, which includes a new car museum, Presley Motors, which houses Elvis&#x27;s Pink Cadillac. The complex features new exhibits and museums, as well as a studio for Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s all-Elvis Presley channel. The service&#x27;s subscribers all over North America can hear Presley&#x27;s music from Graceland around the clock. Not far away on display are his two aircraft including &quot;Lisa Marie&quot; (a Convair 880 jetliner) and &quot;Hound Dog II&quot; (a Lockheed JetStar business jet). The jets are owned by Graceland and are on permanent static display.

In early August 2005, Lisa Marie Presley sold 85% of the business side of her father&#x27;s estate. She kept the Graceland property itself, as well as the bulk of the possessions found therein, and she turned over the management of Graceland to CKX, Inc., an entertainment company (on whose board of directors Priscilla Presley sat) that also owns 19 Entertainment, creator of the &quot;American Idol&quot; TV show.

Graceland Holdings LLC, led by managing partner Joel Weinshanker, is the majority owner of EPE. Lisa Marie Presley&#x27;s estate retains a 15% ownership in the company.

In August 2018, Gladys Presley&#x27;s headstone, which contained the Jewish star of David on one side and a cross on the other and was designed by Elvis himself, which become publicly displayed when it placed in Graceland&#x27;s Mediation Garden after being stored for many years in the Graceland Archive.

Lisa Marie Presley&#x27;s estate, which is being held in trust for her daughters Riley Keough and Harper and Finley Lockwood, retain 100% sole personal ownership of Graceland Mansion itself and its over 13-acre original grounds as well as Elvis Presley&#x27;s personal effects – including costumes, wardrobe, awards, furniture, cars, etc. Prior to her death in 2023, Lisa Marie Presley had made the mansion property and her father&#x27;s personal effects permanently available for tours of Graceland and for use in all of EPE&#x27;s operations.

== Notable visitors ==

According to Elvis Presley&#x27;s Enterprises, staff at Graceland informally kept a list of celebrities who had visited in the first years following Elvis&#x27;s death. This practice was not formalized for a decade. Muhammad Ali, who was a friend of Elvis, was an early celebrity visitor in 1978, as was singer Paul Simon. He toured Graceland in the early 80s and afterward wrote a song of the same name; it was the title track of his Grammy-winning album &quot;Graceland&quot;.

During the Joshua Tree Tour in 1987, U2 toured Graceland. The footage was filmed for the film Rattle &amp; Hum. During the visit, drummer, Larry Mullen Jr., sat on Elvis Presley&#x27;s motorcycle -- against the rules for Graceland visitors.

On June 30, 2006, then US President George W. Bush hosted Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi for a tour of the mansion. It was one of the few private residences on United States soil to have been the site of an official joint-visit by a sitting US president and a serving head of a foreign government. On August 6, 2010, Prince Albert II, Head of State of the Principality of Monaco, and his fiancée (now Princess of Monaco) Charlene Wittstock, toured Graceland while vacationing in the US. On May 26, 2013, Paul McCartney of The Beatles visited Graceland. Prince William and Prince Harry, while in Memphis for a friend&#x27;s wedding, visited Graceland on May 2, 2014.

The home has also been visited by former US President Jimmy Carter; the late Duchess of Devonshire, the sitting ambassadors of India, France, China, Korea and Israel to the United States; as well as several US governors, members of the US Congress, and at least two Nobel Prize winners, namely singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, a Literature Prize laureate, and the former President of Costa Rica, Oscar Arias, a Peace Prize honoree, who visited it on October 10, 2001.

In May 2016, Graceland welcomed a newlywed couple as its 20 millionth visitor.

In June 2022, actors Austin Butler and Tom Hanks visited the mansion and were interviewed virtually by the &quot;Good Morning America&quot; news program from the Jungle Room to talk about their biographical film &quot;Elvis&quot;.

<doc id="82780" wikidata="Q10934" url="?curid=82780" title="Crab Nebula">
<text>The Crab Nebula (catalogue designations M1, NGC 1952, Taurus A) is a supernova remnant and pulsar wind nebula in the constellation of Taurus. The common name comes from a drawing that somewhat resembled a crab with arms produced by William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, in 1842 or 1843 using a telescope. The nebula was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. It corresponds with a bright supernova observed in 1054 C.E. by Native American, Japanese, and Arabic stargazers; this supernova was also recorded by Chinese astronomers as a guest star. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified that corresponds with a historically-observed supernova explosion.

At an apparent magnitude of 8.4, comparable to that of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan, it is not visible to the naked eye but can be made out using binoculars under favourable conditions. The nebula lies in the Perseus Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of about from Earth. It has a diameter of , corresponding to an apparent diameter of some 7 arcminutes, and is expanding at a rate of about , or 0.5% of the speed of light.

The Crab Pulsar, a neutron star across with a spin rate of 30.2 times per second, lies at the center of the Crab Nebula. The star emits pulses of radiation from gamma rays to radio waves. At X-ray and gamma ray energies above 30 keV, the Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent gamma-ray source in the sky, with measured flux extending to above 10 TeV. The nebula&#x27;s radiation allows detailed study of celestial bodies that occult it. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Sun&#x27;s corona was mapped from observations of the Crab Nebula&#x27;s radio waves passing through it, and in 2003, the thickness of the atmosphere of Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan was measured as it blocked out X-rays from the nebula.

==Observational history==

The earliest recorded documentation of observation of astronomical object SN 1054 was as it was occurring in 1054, by Chinese astrononomers and Japanese observers, hence its numerical identification. Modern understanding that the Crab Nebula was created by a supernova traces back to 1921, when Carl Otto Lampland announced he had seen changes in the nebula&#x27;s structure. This 
eventually led to the conclusion that the creation of the Crab Nebula corresponds to the bright SN 1054 supernova recorded by medieval astronomers in AD 1054.

===First identification===

The Crab Nebula was first identified in 1731 by John Bevis. The nebula was independently rediscovered in 1758 by Charles Messier as he was observing a bright comet. Messier catalogued it as the first entry in his catalogue of comet-like objects; in 1757, Alexis Clairaut reexamined the calculations of Edmund Halley and predicted the return of Halley&#x27;s Comet in late 1758. The exact time of the comet&#x27;s return required the consideration of perturbations to its orbit caused by planets in the Solar System such as Jupiter, which Clairaut and his two colleagues Jérôme Lalande and Nicole-Reine Lepaute carried out more precisely than Halley, finding that the comet should appear in the constellation of Taurus. It was in searching in vain for the comet that Charles Messier found the Crab Nebula, which he at first thought to be Halley&#x27;s comet. After some observation, noticing that the object that he was observing was not moving across the sky, Messier concluded that the object was not a comet. Messier then realised the usefulness of compiling a catalogue of celestial objects of a cloudy nature, but fixed in the sky, to avoid incorrectly cataloguing them as comets. This realization led him to compile the &quot;Messier catalogue&quot;.

William Herschel observed the Crab Nebula numerous times between 1783 and 1809, but it is not known whether he was aware of its existence in 1783, or if he discovered it independently of Messier and Bevis. After several observations, he concluded that it was composed of a group of stars. William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse observed the nebula at Birr Castle in the early 1840s using a telescope, and made a drawing of it that showed it with arms like those of a crab. He observed it again later, in 1848, using a telescope but could not confirm the supposed resemblance, but the name stuck nevertheless.

===Connection to SN 1054===
The Crab Nebula was the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion. In the early twentieth century, the analysis of early photographs of the nebula taken several years apart revealed that it was expanding. Tracing the expansion back revealed that the nebula must have become visible on Earth about 900 years before. Historical records revealed that a new star bright enough to be seen in the daytime had been recorded in the same part of the sky by Chinese astronomers on 4 July 1054, and probably also by Japanese observers.

In 1913, when Vesto Slipher registered his spectroscopy study of the sky, the Crab Nebula was again one of the first objects to be studied. Changes in the cloud, suggesting its small extent, were discovered by Carl Lampland in 1921. That same year, John Charles Duncan demonstrated that the remnant was expanding, while Knut Lundmark noted its proximity to the guest star of 1054.

In 1928, Edwin Hubble proposed associating the cloud with the star of 1054, an idea that remained controversial until the nature of supernovae was understood, and it was Nicholas Mayall who indicated that the star of 1054 was undoubtedly the supernova whose explosion produced the Crab Nebula. The search for historical supernovae started at that moment: seven other historical sightings have been found by comparing modern observations of supernova remnants with astronomical documents of past centuries.

After the original connection to Chinese observations, in 1934 connections were made to a 13th-century Japanese reference to a &quot;guest star&quot; in Meigetsuki a few weeks before the Chinese reference. The event was long considered unrecorded in Islamic astronomy, but in 1978 a reference was found in a 13th-century copy made by Ibn Abi Usaibia of a work by Ibn Butlan, a Nestorian Christian physician active in Baghdad at the time of the supernova.

Given its great distance, the daytime &quot;guest star&quot; observed by the Chinese could only have been a supernova—a massive, exploding star, having exhausted its supply of energy from nuclear fusion and collapsed in on itself. Recent analysis of historical records have found that the supernova that created the Crab Nebula probably appeared in April or early May, rising to its maximum brightness of between apparent magnitude −7 and −4.5 (brighter even than Venus&#x27; −4.2 and everything in the night sky except the Moon) by July. The supernova was visible to the naked eye for about two years after its first observation.

===Crab Pulsar===

In the 1960s, because of the prediction and discovery of pulsars, the Crab Nebula again became a major center of interest. It was then that Franco Pacini predicted the existence of the Crab Pulsar for the first time, which would explain the brightness of the cloud. In late 1968, David H. Staelin and Edward C. Reifenstein III reported the discovery of two rapidly variable radio sources in the area of the Crab Nebula using the Green Bank Telescope. They named them NP 0527 and NP 0532. The period of 33 milliseconds and precise location of the Crab Nebula pulsar NP 0532 was discovered by Richard V. E. Lovelace and collaborators on 10 November 1968 at the Arecibo Radio Observatory. This discovery also proved that pulsars are rotating neutron stars (not pulsating white dwarfs, as many scientists suggested). Soon after the discovery of the Crab Pulsar, David Richards discovered (using the Arecibo Observatory) that the Crab Pulsar spins down and, therefore, the pulsar loses its rotational energy. Thomas Gold has shown that the spin-down power of the pulsar is sufficient to power the Crab Nebula.

The discovery of the Crab Pulsar and the knowledge of its exact age (almost to the day) allows for the verification of basic physical properties of these objects, such as characteristic age and spin-down luminosity, the orders of magnitude involved (notably the strength of the magnetic field), along with various aspects related to the dynamics of the remnant. The role of this supernova to the scientific understanding of supernova remnants was crucial, as no other historical supernova created a pulsar whose precise age is known for certain. The only possible exception to this rule would be SN 1181, whose supposed remnant 3C58 is home to a pulsar, but its identification using Chinese observations from 1181 is contested.

The inner part of the Crab Nebula is dominated by a pulsar wind nebula enveloping the pulsar. Some sources consider the Crab Nebula to be an example of both a pulsar wind nebula as well as a supernova remnant, while others separate the two phenomena based on the different sources of energy production and behaviour.

===Source of high-energy gamma rays===
The Crab Nebula was the first astrophysical object confirmed to emit gamma rays in the very-high-energy (VHE) band above 100 GeV in energy. The VHE detection was carried out in 1989 by the Whipple Observatory 10m Gamma-Ray telescope, which opened the VHE gamma-ray window and led to the detection of numerous VHE sources since then.

In 2019 the Crab Nebula was observed to emit gamma rays in excess of 100 TeV, making it the first identified source beyond 100 TeV.

==Physical parameters==
In visible light, the Crab Nebula consists of a broadly oval-shaped mass of filaments, about 6 arcminutes long and 4 arcminutes wide (by comparison, the full moon is 30 arcminutes across) surrounding a diffuse blue central region. In three dimensions, the nebula is thought to be shaped either like an oblate spheroid (estimated as away) or a prolate spheroid (estimated as away). The filaments are the remnants of the progenitor star&#x27;s atmosphere, and consist largely of ionised helium and hydrogen, along with carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, neon and sulfur. The filaments&#x27; temperatures are typically between 11,000 and 18,000 K, and their densities are about 1,300 particles per cm3.

In 1953, Iosif Shklovsky proposed that the diffuse blue region is predominantly produced by synchrotron radiation, which is radiation given off by the curving motion of electrons in a magnetic field. The radiation corresponded to electrons moving at speeds up to half the speed of light. Three years later, the hypothesis was confirmed by observations. In the 1960s it was found that the source of the curved paths of the electrons was the strong magnetic field produced by a neutron star at the centre of the nebula.

===Distance===

Even though the Crab Nebula is the focus of much attention among astronomers, its distance remains an open question, owing to uncertainties in every method used to estimate its distance. In 2008, the consensus was that its distance from Earth is . Along its longest visible dimension, it thus measures about across.

The Crab Nebula currently is expanding outward at about . Images taken several years apart reveal the slow expansion of the nebula, and by comparing this angular expansion with its spectroscopically determined expansion velocity, the nebula&#x27;s distance can be estimated. In 1973, an analysis of many methods used to compute the distance to the nebula had reached a conclusion of about , consistent with the currently cited value.
Tracing back its expansion (assuming a constant decrease of expansion speed due to the nebula&#x27;s mass) yielded a date for the creation of the nebula several decades after 1054, implying that its outward velocity has decelerated less than assumed since the supernova explosion. This reduced deceleration is believed to be caused by energy from the pulsar that feeds into the nebula&#x27;s magnetic field, which expands and forces the nebula&#x27;s filaments outward.

===Mass===
Estimates of the total mass of the nebula are important for estimating the mass of the supernova&#x27;s progenitor star. The amount of matter contained in the Crab Nebula&#x27;s filaments (ejecta mass of ionized and neutral gas; mostly helium) is estimated to be .

===Helium-rich torus===
One of the many nebular components (or anomalies) of the Crab Nebula is a helium-rich torus which is visible as an east–west band crossing the pulsar region. The torus composes about 25% of the visible ejecta. However, it is suggested by calculation that about 95% of the torus is helium. As yet, there has been no plausible explanation put forth for the structure of the torus.

==Central star==

At the center of the Crab Nebula are two faint stars, one of which is the star responsible for the existence of the nebula. It was identified as such in 1942, when Rudolf Minkowski found that its optical spectrum was extremely unusual. The region around the star was found to be a strong source of radio waves in 1949 and X-rays in 1963, and was identified as one of the brightest objects in the sky in gamma rays in 1967. Then, in 1968, the star was found to be emitting its radiation in rapid pulses, becoming one of the first pulsars to be discovered.

Pulsars are sources of powerful electromagnetic radiation, emitted in short and extremely regular pulses many times a second. They were a great mystery when discovered in 1967, and the team who identified the first one considered the possibility that it could be a signal from an advanced civilization. However, the discovery of a pulsating radio source in the centre of the Crab Nebula was strong evidence that pulsars were formed by supernova explosions. They now are understood to be rapidly rotating neutron stars, whose powerful magnetic fields concentrates their radiation emissions into narrow beams.

The Crab Pulsar is believed to be about in diameter; it emits pulses of radiation every 33 milliseconds. Pulses are emitted at wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. Like all isolated pulsars, its period is slowing very gradually. Occasionally, its rotational period shows sharp changes, known as &#x27;glitches&#x27;, which are believed to be caused by a sudden realignment inside the neutron star. The rate of energy released as the pulsar slows down is enormous, and it powers the emission of the synchrotron radiation of the Crab Nebula, which has a total luminosity about 148,000 times greater than that of the Sun.

The pulsar&#x27;s extreme energy output creates an unusually dynamic region at the centre of the Crab Nebula. While most astronomical objects evolve so slowly that changes are visible only over timescales of many years, the inner parts of the Crab Nebula show changes over timescales of only a few days. The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar&#x27;s equatorial wind slams into the bulk of the nebula, forming a shock front. The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly, with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp-like features that steepen, brighten, then fade as they move away from the pulsar to well out into the main body of the nebula.

==Progenitor star==
The star that exploded as a supernova is referred to as the supernova&#x27;s &quot;progenitor star&quot;. Two types of stars explode as supernovae: white dwarfs and massive stars. In the so-called Type Ia supernovae, gases falling onto a &#x27;dead&#x27; white dwarf raise its mass until it nears a critical level, the Chandrasekhar limit, resulting in a runaway nuclear fusion explosion that obliterates the star; in Type Ib/c and Type II supernovae, the progenitor star is a massive star whose core runs out of fuel to power its nuclear fusion reactions and collapses in on itself, releasing gravitational potential energy in a form that blows away the star&#x27;s outer layers. Type Ia supernovae do not produce pulsars, so the pulsar in the Crab Nebula shows it must have formed in a core-collapse supernova.

Theoretical models of supernova explosions suggest that the star that exploded to produce the Crab Nebula must have had a mass of between . Stars with masses lower than are thought to be too small to produce supernova explosions, and end their lives by producing a planetary nebula instead, while a star heavier than would have produced a nebula with a different chemical composition from that observed in the Crab Nebula. Recent studies, however, suggest the progenitor could have been a super-asymptotic giant branch star in the range that would have exploded in an electron-capture supernova. In June 2021 a paper in the journal &quot;Nature Astronomy&quot; reported that the 2018 supernova SN 2018zd (in the galaxy NGC 2146, about 31 million light-years from Earth) appeared to be the first observation of an electron-capture supernova The 1054 supernova explosion that created the Crab Nebula had been thought to be the best candidate for an electron-capture supernova, and the 2021 paper makes it more likely that this was correct.

A significant problem in studies of the Crab Nebula is that the combined mass of the nebula and the pulsar add up to considerably less than the predicted mass of the progenitor star, and the question of where the &#x27;missing mass&#x27; is, remains unresolved. Estimates of the mass of the nebula are made by measuring the total amount of light emitted, and calculating the mass required, given the measured temperature and density of the nebula. Estimates range from about , with being the generally accepted value. The neutron star mass is estimated to be between .

The predominant theory to account for the missing mass of the Crab Nebula is that a substantial proportion of the mass of the progenitor was carried away before the supernova explosion in a fast stellar wind, a phenomenon commonly seen in Wolf–Rayet stars. However, this would have created a shell around the nebula. Although attempts have been made at several wavelengths to observe a shell, none has yet been found.

==Transits by Solar System bodies==
The Crab Nebula lies roughly 1.5 degrees away from the ecliptic—the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. This means that the Moon—and occasionally, planets—can transit or occult the nebula. Although the Sun does not transit the nebula, its corona passes in front of it. These transits and occultations can be used to analyse both the nebula and the object passing in front of it, by observing how radiation from the nebula is altered by the transiting body.

===Lunar===
Lunar transits have been used to map X-ray emissions from the nebula. Before the launch of X-ray-observing satellites, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, X-ray observations generally had quite low angular resolution, but when the Moon passes in front of the nebula, its position is very accurately known, and so the variations in the nebula&#x27;s brightness can be used to create maps of X-ray emission. When X-rays were first observed from the Crab Nebula, a lunar occultation was used to determine the exact location of their source.

===Solar===
The Sun&#x27;s corona passes in front of the Crab Nebula every June. Variations in the radio waves received from the Crab Nebula at this time can be used to infer details about the corona&#x27;s density and structure. Early observations established that the corona extended out to much greater distances than had previously been thought; later observations found that the corona contained substantial density variations.

===Other objects===
Very rarely, Saturn transits the Crab Nebula. Its transit on 4 January 2003 (UTC) was the first since 31 December 1295 (O.S.); another will not occur until 5 August 2267. Researchers used the Chandra X-ray Observatory to observe Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan as it crossed the nebula, and found that Titan&#x27;s X-ray &#x27;shadow&#x27; was larger than its solid surface, due to absorption of X-rays in its atmosphere. These observations showed that the thickness of Titan&#x27;s atmosphere is . The transit of Saturn itself could not be observed, because Chandra was passing through the Van Allen belts at the time.

<text>La Recoleta Cemetery () is a cemetery located in the Recoleta neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It contains the graves of notable people, including Eva Perón, presidents of Argentina, Nobel Prize winners, the founder of the Argentine Navy, and military commanders such as Julio Argentino Roca. In 2011, the BBC hailed it as one of the world&#x27;s best cemeteries, and in 2013, CNN listed it among the 10 most beautiful cemeteries in the world.

==History==

Franciscan Recollect monks () arrived in this area, then the outskirts of Buenos Aires, in the early eighteenth century. The cemetery is built around the Recollect Convent () and a church, Our Lady of the Pillar (&quot;), built in 1732.

The order was disbanded in 1822, and the garden of the convent converted into the first public cemetery in Buenos Aires. Inaugurated on 17 November of the same year under the name of &quot; (Northern Cemetery), those responsible for its creation were the then-Governor Martin Rodríguez, who would be eventually buried in the cemetery, and government minister Bernardino Rivadavia.

The 1822 layout was done by French civil engineer Próspero Catelin, who also designed the current facade of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral. The cemetery was last remodeled in 1881, while Torcuato de Alvear was mayor of the city, by the Italian architect Juan Antonio Buschiazzo.

==Description==
Set in , the site contains 4691 vaults, all above ground, of which 94 have been declared National Historical Monuments by the Argentine government and are protected by the state. The entrance to the cemetery is through neo-classical gates with tall Doric columns. The cemetery contains many elaborate marble mausoleums, decorated with statues, in a wide variety of architectural styles such as Art Deco, Art Nouveau, Baroque, and Neo-Gothic, and most materials used between 1880 and 1930 in the construction of tombs were imported from Paris and Milan. The entire cemetery is laid out in sections like city blocks, with wide tree-lined main walkways branching into sidewalks filled with mausoleums. These mausoleums are still being used by rich families in Argentina that have their own vault and keep their deceased there. While many of the mausoleums are in fine shape and well-maintained, others have fallen into disrepair. Several can be found with broken glass and littered with rubbish. Among many memorials are works by notable Argentine sculptors, Lola Mora and Luis Perlotti for instance. The tomb of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak, due to its unusual design, is of special interest.
The cemetery also hosts a colony of stray cats which has also become an attraction. As of 2024, the resident feline population has decreased from a peak of 60 in the 1960s to about 12 due to adoption drives.

<doc id="82785" wikidata="Q8450" url="?curid=82785" title="1980 Summer Olympics">
<text>The 1980 Summer Olympics (), officially known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad () and officially branded as Moscow 1980 (), were an international multi-sport event held from 19 July to 3 August 1980 in Moscow, Soviet Union, in present-day Russia. The games were the first to be staged in an Eastern Bloc country, as well as the first Olympic Games and only Summer Olympics to be held in a Slavic language-speaking country. They were also the only Summer Olympic Games to be held in a self-proclaimed communist country until the 2008 Summer Olympics held in China. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin before he was succeeded by Juan Antonio Samaranch shortly afterward.

Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games, the smallest number since 1956. Led by the United States, 66 countries boycotted the games entirely, because of the Soviet–Afghan War. Several alternative events were held outside of the Soviet Union. Some athletes from some of the boycotting countries (not included in the list of 66 countries that boycotted the games entirely) participated in the games under the Olympic Flag. The Soviet Union later boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals, with the USSR and East Germany winning 127 out of 203 available golds.

==Host city selection==
The only two cities to bid for the 1980 Summer Olympics were Moscow and Los Angeles. The choice between them was made at the 75th IOC Session in Vienna, Austria on 23 October 1974. Los Angeles would eventually host the 1984 Summer Olympics.

==Participation and boycott==

Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Olympics, the smallest number since 1956. Of the eighty participating nations, seven National Olympic Committees made their first appearance at these Games: Angola, Botswana, Cyprus, Jordan, Laos, Mozambique and Seychelles. It was also the first time Vietnam participated after the end of the Vietnam War and the Reunification of Vietnam. None of these nations won a medal.

29 countries boycotted the previous 1976 Summer Olympics in protest against the IOC for not expelling New Zealand, which had sanctioned a rugby tour of apartheid South Africa. The 1980 Summer Olympics were disrupted by another, even larger, boycott led by the United States in protest of the 1979 Soviet–Afghan War. The Soviet invasion spurred President Jimmy Carter to issue an ultimatum on 20 January 1980, which stated that the U.S. would boycott the Moscow Olympics if Soviet troops did not withdraw from Afghanistan within one month. 66 countries and regions invited did not participate in the 1980 Olympics. Many of these followed the United States&#x27; boycott initiative, while others cited economic reasons for not participating. Iran, under Ayatollah Khomeini hostile to both superpowers, boycotted when the Islamic Conference condemned the invasion. Neither the People&#x27;s Republic of China nor Taiwan (Republic of China) participated in the games, the former as a consequence of the Sino-Soviet split.

Many of the boycotting nations participated instead in the Liberty Bell Classic, also known as the &quot;Olympic Boycott Games&quot;, in Philadelphia. Those that competed had won 71 percent of all medals and gold medals at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. This was in part due to state-run doping programs that had been developed in the Eastern Bloc countries. As a form of protest against the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, fifteen countries marched in the Opening Ceremony with the Olympic Flag instead of their national flags, and the Olympic Flag and Olympic Hymn were used at medal ceremonies when athletes from these countries won medals. Competitors from New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain competed under the flags of their respective National Olympic Committees. Some of these teams that marched under flags other than their national flags were depleted by boycotts by individual athletes, while some athletes did not participate in the march.

The boycott impacted the competitiveness of swimming, track and field, boxing, basketball, diving, field hockey and equestrian sports. Whilst competitors from 36 countries became Olympic medalists, the great majority of the medals were taken by the Soviet Union and East Germany in what was the most skewed medal tally since 1904.

==Events, records and drug tests==
There were 203 events – more than at any previous Olympics. 36 world records, 39 European records and 74 Olympic records were set at the games. In total, this was more records than were set at Montreal. New Olympic records were set 241 times over the course of the competitions and world records were beaten 97 times.

Though no athletes were caught doping at the 1980 Summer Olympics, it has been revealed that athletes had begun using testosterone and other drugs for which tests had not been yet developed. According to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency&#x27;s officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were &quot;rescued with [these] tremendous efforts&quot;. A 1989 report by a committee of the Australian Senate claimed that &quot;there is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner...who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might well have been called the Chemists&#x27; Games&quot;.

A member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to epitestosterone in urine. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official. The results of Donike&#x27;s unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols. The first documented case of &quot;blood doping&quot; occurred at the 1980 Summer Olympics as a runner was transfused with two pints of blood before winning medals in the 5000 m and 10,000 m.

==Media and broadcasting==
Major broadcasters of the 1980 Games were USSR State TV and Radio (1,370 accreditation cards), Eurovision (31 countries, 818 cards) and Intervision (11 countries, 342 cards). TV Asahi with 68 cards provided coverage for Japan, while OTI, representing Latin America, received 59 cards, and the Seven Network provided coverage for Australia (48 cards). NBC, which had intended to be another major broadcaster, canceled its coverage in response to the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Games, and became a minor broadcaster with 56 accreditation cards, although they did air highlights and recaps of the Games on a regular basis. ABC aired scenes of the opening ceremony during its &quot;Nightline&quot; program, and promised highlights each night, but later announced that they could not air any highlights as NBC still had exclusive broadcast rights in the US. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) almost canceled their plans for coverage after Canada took part in the boycott, and was represented by nine cards. The television center used 20 television channels, compared to 16 for the Montreal Games, 12 for the Munich Games, and seven for the Mexico City Games. This was also the first time North Korea was watching, as KCTV (Korea Central Television) broadcast it as their first satellite program.

==Commemoration==
A series of commemorative coins was released in the USSR in 1977–1980 to commemorate the event. It consisted of five platinum coins, six gold coins, 28 silver coins and six copper-nickel coins.

==Budget==
According to the Official Report, submitted to the IOC by the NOC of the USSR, total expenditures for the preparations for and staging of the 1980 Games were US$1,350,000,000, total revenues being US$231,000,000. To obtain additional funds for the competition, the Organizing Committee organized Olympic lotteries. The proceeds from the lotteries covered 25% of the cost of holding the competition.

==Cost==
&quot;The Oxford Olympics Study&quot; established the outturn cost of the Moscow 1980 Summer Olympics at US$6.3 billion in 2015 dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are &quot;not&quot; included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost for Moscow 1980 compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016 (projected), US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. Average cost for the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.

==Opening ceremony==
==Event highlights==
===Archery===

* Tomi Poikolainen of Finland, who had not finished any of the previous three days&#x27; shooting higher than fourth, came from fourth on the last day to win the men&#x27;s archery competition, scoring 2455 points. He won gold just three points ahead of a Soviet athlete.
* The women&#x27;s archery gold was won by Ketevan Losaberidze (USSR), who was also the European, Soviet and world champion.
* The women&#x27;s archery silver was won by Natalia Butuzova (USSR), who had set nine national records and three world records in 1979.
* The U.S. archery team was one of the strongest ever fielded, but due to the boycott, the team never had a chance to prove itself. This team held every record and featured 1976 Olympic champion Darrell O. Pace, who was averaging 100 points more than the winning score in Moscow at the time.

===Athletics===
* Ethiopian Miruts Yifter won the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres athletics double, emulating Lasse Virén&#x27;s 1972 and 1976 performances.
* &quot;I have a 90% chance of winning the 1,500 metres,&quot; wrote Steve Ovett in an article for one of Britain&#x27;s Sunday papers just before the start of the Olympics. After he won the 800 metres Olympic gold, beating world-record holder Sebastian Coe, Ovett stated he would not only win the 1,500 metres race, but would beat the world record by as much as four seconds. Ovett had won 45 straight 1,500 metres races since May 1977. In contrast, Coe had competed in only eight 1,500 metres races between 1976 and 1980. Coe won the race, holding off Ovett in the final lap, who finished third.
* Aided by the absence of American opposition, Allan Wells beat Cuban Silvio Leonard to become the first Briton since 1924 to win the Olympic 100 metres race. 
* Gerd Wessig, who had made the East German team only two weeks before the Games, easily won the gold medal with a high jump. This was 9 cm higher than he had ever jumped before.
* In the 1980 Olympic women&#x27;s long jump competition, Soviet jumper Tatiana Kolpakova bested her compatriots and other competitors by setting a new Olympic record of .
* Poland&#x27;s Władysław Kozakiewicz won the pole vault with a jump of – only the second pole vaulting world record to be established during an Olympics. The previous time had been at the Antwerp Olympics 1920.

* Lutz Dombrowski (GDR) won the long jump gold. His was the longest jump recorded at sea level and he became only the second ever to jump further than .
* In the triple jump final, Viktor Saneyev (USSR; present day-Georgia), who won gold at Mexico, Munich and Montreal, won silver behind Jaak Uudmäe (USSR; present day-Estonia) and ahead of Brazil&#x27;s world record holder João Carlos de Oliveira. Both de Oliveira and Australia&#x27;s Ian Campbell produced long jumps, but they were declared fouls by the officials and not measured; in Campbell&#x27;s case, his longest jump was ruled a &quot;scrape foul&quot;, with his trailing leg touching the track during the jump. Campbell insisted that he had not scraped, and it was alleged the officials intentionally threw out his and de Oliveira&#x27;s best jumps to favor the Soviets, similarly to a number of other events.
* Yuriy Sedykh (USSR) won gold in the hammer throw event. Four of his six throws broke the world record of 80m. No hammer thrower in the world had ever achieved this before. As in Montreal, the USSR won gold, silver and bronze in this event.
* Evelin Jahl (GDR), the 1976 Olympic champion, won discus gold again. She won with a new Olympic record – – having been undefeated since Montreal.
* Cuba&#x27;s María Caridad Colón won the women&#x27;s javelin, setting a new Olympic record.

* In track-and-field, six world records, eighteen Olympic records and nine best results of the year were registered.
* In women&#x27;s track and field, events alone either a world or Olympic record was broken in almost every event.
* Daley Thompson of Great Britain won the gold in the Decathlon. He won gold again at the Los Angeles Olympics.
* Soviet Dainis Kula won gold in the men&#x27;s javelin. He also had the best sum total of throws, showing his consistency. He finished ahead of his teammate Alexander Makarov.
* Polish gold medallist pole vaulter Władysław Kozakiewicz showed an obscene bras d&#x27;honneur gesture in all four directions to the jeering Soviet public, causing an international scandal and almost losing his medal as a result. There were numerous incidents and accusations of Soviet officials using their authority to negate marks by opponents to the point that IAAF officials found the need to look over the officials&#x27; shoulders to try to keep the events fair. There were also accusations of opening stadium gates to give Soviet athletes advantage, and causing other disturbances to opposing athletes.

===Basketball===

* Basketball was one of the hardest hit sports due to the boycott. Though replacements were found, five men&#x27;s teams including the defending Olympic Champion United States withdrew from the competition in addition to the US Women&#x27;s team.
* In the women&#x27;s competition, the host Soviet Union won the competition beating Bulgaria for gold, Yugoslavia won bronze.
* The men&#x27;s competition featured only the second instance of the US Men&#x27;s Basketball team not winning gold with the first one being in Munich. Yugoslavia took home the gold beating Italy in the final. The hosts, Soviet Union, winners in 1972, won the bronze.

===Boxing===

* Teófilo Stevenson of Cuba became the first boxer to win three consecutive Olympic titles in heavyweight, and indeed the only boxer to win the same event in three Games. (László Papp from Hungary was the first boxer to win three titles). In boxing, Cuba won six gold, two silvers and two bronzes.

* The cycling team road race was won by the Soviet team as they had done in Munich and Montreal.
* In cycling, world records were toppled 21 times.

===Diving===

* As Aleksandr Portnov waited to do a 2 and 1/2 reverse somersault in the springboard final, cheers broke out in the adjoining swimming pool during the closing stages of Vladimir Salnikov&#x27;s world record breaking 1,500m swim. The diver delayed his start until the noise had subsided but, as he took his first steps along the board, even greater cheers broke out as Salnikov touched in under 15 minutes. Under the rules, Portnov, having started, could not stop before take-off. On protest to the Swedish referee G.Olander, he was allowed to repeat the dive, and went ahead again of Mexico&#x27;s Carlos Girón. Later protests by Mexico against the re-dive and by East Germany that their Falk Hoffmann wanted to re-dive after allegedly being disturbed by photographic flashlights were both turned down by FINA. FINA President Javier Ostas stated that the decision taken by the Swedish referee was the &quot;correct one&quot;. FINA assessed all the Olympic diving events and considers the judging to have been objective. Portnov remained the winner, with Giron taking silver and Cagnatto of Italy bronze.
* Martina Jaschke (East Germany) was fourth after the preliminary high dives, but came back to win gold on the second day of competition.
* Irina Kalinina (USSR) won gold in the springboard final. As a result of her ten dives in the preliminaries, she amassed a unique number of points: 478.86. In the previous four years, no diver had scored so many.
* In this final, the Mexican judge A. Marsikal allowed Karin Guthke (East Germany) to re-take a dive.

===Equestrian===

* In the individual show jumping event, Poland&#x27;s Jan Kowalczyk and the USSR&#x27;s Nikolai Korolkov each had 8 faults, but Kowalczyk won gold as his horse completed the course the quicker. Poland won the last of the 203 gold medals contested.

===Field hockey===

* Six countries competed in the women&#x27;s field hockey: Austria, India, Poland, Czechoslovakia, USSR, and Zimbabwe. The gold medal was won by the team of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe did not learn it would get a place in the tournament until 35 days before the Games began, and chose its team only the weekend before the opening ceremony.

* Soviet wrestlers won 12 golds.

==Closing ceremony==


Because of the U.S. boycott, changes were made to the traditional elements of the closing ceremony that represent the handover to the host city of the next Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Among them, the flag of the city of Los Angeles instead of the United States flag was raised, and the Olympic Anthem instead of the national anthem of the United States was played. There was also no &quot;Antwerp Ceremony&quot;, where the ceremonial Olympic flag was transferred from the Mayor of Moscow to the Mayor of Los Angeles; instead the flag was kept by the Moscow city authorities until 1984. Furthermore, there was no next host city presentation.

Both the opening and closing ceremonies were shown in Yuri Ozerov&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Oh, Sport – You Are The World!&quot; ().

<text>Pita ( or ) or pitta (British English) is a family of yeast-leavened round flatbreads baked from wheat flour, common in the Mediterranean, Levant, and neighboring areas. It includes the widely known version with an interior pocket, also known as Arabic bread (; &quot;khubz ʿArabī&quot;). In the United Kingdom, Lebanese bread is used for pocket versions such as the Greek pita, and are used for barbecues as a souvlaki wrap. The Western name &quot;pita&quot; may sometimes be used to refer to various other types of flatbreads that have different names in their local languages, such as numerous styles of Arab &quot;khubz&quot; (bread).

==Etymology==
The first mention of the word in English cited in the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1936. The English word is borrowed from Modern Greek (, &quot;bread, cake, pie&quot;), in turn from Byzantine Greek (attested in 1108), possibly from Ancient Greek () or (), both &quot;pitch/resin&quot; for the gloss, or from (, &quot;fermented pastry&quot;), which may have passed to Latin as cf. pizza. In Levantine Arabic it evolved into , (since Old Arabic /p/ evolved into /f/). Other hypotheses trace the word back to the Classical Hebrew word (, lit. &quot;a morsel of bread&quot;). It is spelled like the Aramaic (), from which it was received into Byzantine Greek (see above). Hypotheses also exist for Germanic or Illyrian intermediaries.

The word has been borrowed by the Turkish language as , and appears in the Balkan languages as Bosnian-Serbian-Croatian , Romanian , Albanian , and Bulgarian or ; however, in the Serbo-Croatian languages of the countries comprising the former Yugoslavia, this culinary item is known as &quot;somun&quot; or &quot;lepinja&quot; while the word pita is used in a general sense meaning pie.

In Arabic, the phrase (, lit. &quot;pita bread&quot;) is sometimes used; other names are simply (, &quot;bread&quot;), (, &quot;Arab bread&quot;) or (, &quot;al-kimaj bread&quot;). In Egypt, it is called () or simply (, &quot;bread&quot;), although other subtypes of &quot;bread&quot; are common in Egypt, such as eish fino and eish merahrah.

In Greek, () is understood by default to refer to the thicker, pocketless Greek pita, whereas the thinner &quot;khubz&quot;-style pita is referred to as (, lit. &quot;Arabic pastry&quot;).

==History==
Pita has roots in the prehistoric flatbreads of the Near East. There is evidence from about 14,500 years ago, during the Stone Age, that the Natufian people in what is now Jordan made a kind of flatbread from wild cereal grains. Ancient wheat and barley were among the earliest domesticated crops in the Neolithic period of about 10,000 years ago, in the Fertile Crescent. By 4,000 years ago, bread was of central importance in societies such as the Babylonian culture of Mesopotamia, where the earliest-known written records and recipes of bread-making originate, and where pita-like flatbreads cooked in a &quot;tinûru&quot; (&quot;tannur&quot; or &quot;tandoor&quot;) were a basic element of the diet, and much the same as today&#x27;s tandoor bread, taboon bread, and laffa, an Iraqi flatbread with many similarities with pita. However, there is no record of the steam-puffed, two-layer &quot;pocket pita&quot; in the ancient texts, or in any of the medieval Arab cookbooks, and according to food historians such as Charles Perry and Gil Marks it was likely a later development.

==Preparation==

Most pita breads are baked at high temperatures (), which turns the water in the dough into steam, thus causing the pita to puff up and form a pocket. When removed from the oven, the layers of baked dough remain separated inside the deflated pita, which allows the bread to be opened to form a pocket. However, pita is sometimes baked without pockets and is called &quot;pocket-less pita&quot;. Pita is traditionally served fresh from the oven (typically a wood-fired oven similar to a pizza oven). It is best either soon after baking or on the same day, and can be served warm.

Modern commercial pita bread is prepared on advanced automatic production lines, processing silos of flour at a time and producing thousands of pitas per hour. The ovens used in commercial baking are much hotter than traditional clay ovens——so each pita is baked only for one minute. The pita are then air-cooled for about 20 minutes on conveyor belts before being shipped immediately or else stored in commercial freezers kept at a temperature of .

==Culinary use==

Pita can be used to scoop sauces or dips, such as hummus, or to wrap kebabs, gyros, or falafel in the manner of sandwiches. It can also be cut and baked into crispy pita chips.

In Turkish cuisine, the word &quot;pide&quot; may refer to three different styles of bread: a flatbread similar to that eaten in Greece and Arab countries, a pizza-like dish, içli pide, where the filling is placed on the (often boat-shaped) dough before baking, and Ramazan pidesi. The first type of &quot;pide&quot; is used to wrap various styles of kebab, while the second is topped with cheese, ground meat, or other fresh or cured meats, and/or vegetables. Regional variations in the shape, baking technique, and toppings create distinctive styles for each region.

In Cyprus, pita is typically rounder, fluffier and baked on a cast-iron skillet. It is used for souvlakia, sheftalia, halloumi with lountza, and gyros. In Greece the word &quot;pita&quot; means &quot;pastry&quot; and is usually used for various cakes and pastries like spanakopita (spinach pie) and karydopita (walnut cake) unrelated to the English language &quot;pita&quot; flatbread. Traditional breads in Greek cuisine are leavened loaves, such as the round καρβέλι karvéli or the oblong φραντζόλα frantzóla. This style of pita flatbread, in the English language meaning of the word, is almost exclusively used as a wrap for &quot;souvlaki&quot; or gyros usually garnished with some combination of tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, onions, and french fries.

In Israel, pita is generally softer, thicker and doughier than other flatbreads, and it always contains a pocket. The pocket of the pita has thick walls, which according to the owner of a New York cafe are unique to Israeli pita, and help Israeli pita be sturdy enough for its signature fillings such as hummus, sabich, falafel, shawarma and chicken schnitzel, among others. Druze pita is also very popular. The Druze-style pita is filled with labneh (thick yoghurt) and topped with olive oil and za&#x27;atar.

In Bosnia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Serbia, the local style of pitta is known as &quot;lepinja&quot;, &quot;somun&quot;, &quot;purlenka&quot; or &quot;pitica&quot;, and is the most common bread served with barbecued food like ćevapi, pljeskavica, kebapche or grilled sausages. The word &quot;pita&quot; itself, on the other hand, is used for &quot;pie&quot; in the general sense in all local languages, and is mostly used for börek or various sweet phyllo pastry dishes (with the exception of baklava which is always called that).

Pita is also present in the cuisine of the Aromanians.

<text>Thomas Leo McCarey (October 3, 1898 – July 5, 1969) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. He was involved in nearly 200 films, including the critically acclaimed &quot;Duck Soup&quot;, &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;My Son John&quot; and &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;.

While focusing mainly on screwball comedies during the 1930s, McCarey turned towards producing more socially conscious and overtly religious films during the 1940s, ultimately finding success and acclaim in both genres. McCarey was one of the most popular and established comedy directors of the pre-World War II era.

==Life and career==
Born in Los Angeles, California, McCarey attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School and Los Angeles High School. His father was Thomas J. McCarey, whom the Los Angeles Times called &quot;the greatest fight promoter in the world.&quot; Leo McCarey would later make a boxing comedy with Harold Lloyd called &quot;The Milky Way&quot; (1936).

McCarey graduated from the University of Southern California law school and besides the law tried mining, boxing, and songwriting before becoming an assistant director to Tod Browning in 1919. It was McCarey&#x27;s boyhood friend, the actor and future fellow director David Butler, who referred him to Browning. Browning convinced McCarey, despite his photogenic looks, to work on the creative side as a writer rather than as an actor. McCarey then honed his skills at the Hal Roach Studios. Roach had hired him as a gagman in 1923, after McCarey had impressed him with his sense of humor following a handball game at a sports club.

McCarey initially wrote gags for the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series and other studio stars, then produced and directed shorts including two-reelers with Charley Chase. Chase would, in fact, become McCarey&#x27;s mentor. Upon the comedian&#x27;s death in 1940, McCarey was quoted as saying, &quot;Whatever success I have had or may have, I owe to his help because he taught me all I know.&quot; The two men were especially compatible, as they both enjoyed a side hobby trying to write popular songs.

While at Roach, McCarey, according to later interviews, cast Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy together and guided development of their onscreen characters, thus creating one of the most enduring comedy teams of all time. He only officially appeared as director of the duo&#x27;s shorts &quot;We Faw Down&quot; (1928), &quot;Liberty&quot; (1929) and &quot;Wrong Again&quot; (1929), but wrote many screenplays and supervised the direction by others. By 1929, he was vice-president of production for the studio. Less well known from this period are the shorts he directed with Max Davidson when Roach put together the Irish-American McCarey with the Jewish-American actor for a series of &quot;dialect comedies.&quot; They were rediscovered in recent years after their 1994 exhibition at the Giornate del Cinema Muto in Pordenone Italy.

In the sound era, McCarey focused on feature film direction, working with many of the biggest stars of the era including Gloria Swanson (&quot;Indiscreet&quot;, 1931), Eddie Cantor (&quot;The Kid From Spain&quot;, 1932), the Marx Brothers (&quot;Duck Soup&quot;, 1933), W.C. Fields (&quot;Six of a Kind&quot;, 1934), and Mae West (&quot;Belle of the Nineties&quot;, 1934).
A series of six films at Paramount came to a crashing halt with his production of &quot;Make Way for Tomorrow&quot; in 1937. While the story of an elderly couple who have to be separated for economic and family reasons during the Depression was not without humor in its treatment, the results were too unpopular at the box office and the director was let go. Nonetheless, the film was recognized early on for its importance by being selected for the permanent collection of the recently formed Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In later years it became canonical, and even considered by some as McCarey&#x27;s masterpiece, due to perceptive champions such as Bertrand Tavernier, Charles Silver and Robin Wood.

Invited to Columbia later in 1937, McCarey earned his first Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant. It was a screwball comedy that launched Grant&#x27;s unique screen persona, largely concocted by McCarey (Grant copied many of McCarey&#x27;s mannerisms). Along with the similarity in their names, McCarey and Cary Grant shared a physical resemblance, making mimicking McCarey&#x27;s intonations and expressions even easier for Grant. As writer/director Peter Bogdanovich notes, &quot;After &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, when it came to light comedy, there was Cary Grant and then everyone else was an also-ran.&quot; 

After the success of &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;, McCarey could have become a Columbia contract director with a certain independence, like Frank Capra. Instead, he went his own way, selling the story that would become &quot;The Cowboy And The Lady&quot; to Sam Goldwyn and then moving to RKO for three films. A car accident in 1940 prevented him from directing &quot;My Favorite Wife,&quot; a kind of follow up to &quot;The Awful Truth&quot; with the same two stars, so it was turned over to Garson Kanin though McCarey worked on some of the editing. Another McCarey project for RKO, &quot;They Knew What They Wanted&quot;, was also turned over to Kanin.

McCarey was a devout Roman Catholic and was deeply concerned with social issues. During the 1940s, his work became more serious and his politics more conservative. In 1944 he directed &quot;Going My Way&quot;, a story about an enterprising priest, the youthful Father Chuck O&#x27;Malley, played by Bing Crosby, for which he won his second Best Director Oscar and Crosby won a Best Actor Oscar. McCarey&#x27;s share in the profits from this smash hit gave him the highest reported income in the U.S. for 1944, and its follow-up, &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; (1945), which paired Crosby with Ingrid Bergman and was made by McCarey&#x27;s newly formed production company, was similarly successful. According to Paul Harrill in &quot;Great Directors&quot;, McCarey acknowledged that the film is largely based on his aunt, Sister Mary Benedict, who died of typhoid. McCarey testified as a friendly witness early on in the hearings of the Un-American Activities Committee which was investigating Communist activity in Hollywood.

The public reacted negatively to some of his films after World War II; for instance, his anti-communist film &quot;My Son John&quot; (1952) failed at the box office. But five years later, he co-wrote, produced, and directed &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot;. The film, starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, was a remake (with precisely the same script) of his 1939 film &quot;Love Affair&quot; with Irene Dunne and Charles Boyer. In 1993, the hugely popular romantic comedy film &quot;Sleepless In Seattle&quot; by Nora Ephron made such frequent references to &quot;An Affair To Remember&quot; that it gave the older film a whole new lease on life in revivals, cable TV, and video, with the result that it is probably McCarey&#x27;s most popular and easily accessible film today. He followed this hit with &quot;Rally Round the Flag, Boys!&quot; (1958), a comedy starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward. His last picture was the poorly received &quot;Satan Never Sleeps&quot; (1962), which, like &quot;My Son John&quot;, was a stern critique of Communism.

Auteurist critic Andrew Sarris has said that McCarey &quot;represents a principle of improvisation in the history of the American film.&quot; Through most of his career, McCarey&#x27;s filming method, rooted in the silents, was to drastically alter the story ideas, bits of business, and dialogue in the scripts previously provided to the studios and the actors. He would usually sit at a piano and doodle as the sometimes exasperated crew waited for inspiration. As Bing Crosby said about &quot;Going My Way&quot;: &quot;I think probably 75 percent of each day&#x27;s shooting was made up on the set by Leo.&quot;

While this technique was responsible for a certain awkwardness and some rough edges in the finished works, many of McCarey&#x27;s scenes had a freshness and spontaneity lacking in the typical mainstream Hollywood cinema. He was not the only director of his time to work this way: fellow comedy directors Gregory La Cava, Howard Hawks and George Stevens – the last also a Roach graduate – were known for their use of improvisation on the set.

French director Jean Renoir once paid the great tribute of saying that &quot;Leo McCarey understood people better than any other Hollywood director.&quot;

==Death==
Leo McCarey died on July 5, 1969, aged 70, from emphysema. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. His younger brother, director Ray McCarey, had died 21 years earlier. In 1978, Leo McCarey&#x27;s production records, including scripts, budgets and correspondence were donated to the Charles Feldman Library at the American Film Institute in Beverly Hills.

<text>Susan Mary Barrantes (&quot;née&quot; Wright, previously Ferguson; 9 June 193719 September 1998) was a documentary filmmaker and the mother of Sarah, Duchess of York, as well as the maternal grandmother of princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

Her elopement with an Argentinian polo player caused a stir in social circles. After his death, she became a film producer in Buenos Aires. She died in a car crash at the age of 61.

==Early life and first marriage==
Barrantes was born in Bramcote, Nottinghamshire, the daughter of FitzHerbert Wright and the Hon. Doreen Wingfield, sister of Mervyn Patrick Wingfield, 9th Viscount Powerscourt. She was the youngest of four children, with two sisters, Brigid and Davinia, and a brother, Bryan. Susan&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Mervyn Wingfield, 8th Viscount Powerscourt. Her father was a director of the coal and iron-producing Butterley Company in Ripley, Derbyshire, and was the great-grandson of industrialist and philanthropist Francis Wright.

Susan Wright completed school and for a short time attended secretarial college. During the debutante season of 1954, she was presented at the court of Queen Elizabeth II.

On 17 January 1956, Susan married Lieutenant Ronald Ferguson (1931–2003) at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. He rose to the rank of Major, played polo with the Duke of Edinburgh, and became the polo manager for Charles, the Prince of Wales. Ronald and Susan had two daughters: Jane Louisa, born on 26 August 1957, and Sarah Margaret, later known as the Duchess of York, born on 15 October 1959.

==Divorce and second marriage==
In 1972, Susan caused a stir in society circles by leaving her family to move to Argentina with professional polo player Héctor Barrantes. Her daughters were then raised by their father Ronald with the help of extended family. Susan and Ronald divorced in 1974, and in 1975 she married Barrantes.

Susan and her new husband moved to the ranch-manor &quot;El Pucará&quot; in Tres Lomas, Argentina. In her writings and filmographic work, she recorded that aside from the birth of her two daughters, her life in Argentina was the happiest time of her life personally and professionally, since she had the chance to explore and develop a documentary film career that combined her two passions, polo and film. She also assisted her husband&#x27;s business of breeding polo ponies and cattle until his death from cancer in 1990. 

Widowhood brought financial difficulties for Susan Barrantes, and she once again decided to start afresh. Selling more than half the farm to the polo-playing Australian media magnate Kerry Packer, she relocated to a large flat in the Recoleta-Palermo borough of Buenos Aires and set up a television production company, making films about horses.

Susan remained firm friends with Prince Charles, who contributed a foreword to her book &quot;Polo&quot;.

==Death==
While returning to her country home on 19 September 1998, the Rover 400 she was driving collided head on with a Renault catering truck on a two-lane highway in flat countryside. The driver of the truck, Jose Maria Rodriguez, suffered a broken ankle, but Barrantes was not wearing a safety belt and was decapitated, aged 61. Barrantes&#x27; 25-year-old nephew, Raphael, was in her car and was hospitalized with minor injuries. Barrantes had been involved in a road traffic crash the year before when her car flipped an estimated seven times.

Susan Barrantes is buried beside her second husband in a vault beneath her home, next to a polo field on the &quot;El Pucara&quot; estate in Tres Lomas, Argentina. Her death came just one year after that of her daughter&#x27;s former sister-in-law Diana, Princess of Wales, whose funeral Susan and Sarah had both attended.

<doc id="82802" wikidata="Q19378" url="?curid=82802" title="Giannutri">
<text>Giannutri () is a small island in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the coast of Tuscany, Italy; it is the southernmost island of the Tuscan Archipelago and it is a &quot;frazione&quot; of the &quot;comune&quot; of Isola del Giglio in the Province of Grosseto.

==Geography==
Giannutri was known as &quot;Dianium&quot; by the Romans and &quot;Artemisia&quot;, &quot;Αρτεμησία&quot; by the Greeks; it has a crescent moon shape which forms the Gulf of Spalmatoio and is placed at south east from the Isola del Giglio and from Porto Ercole. The island has a coastal perimeter of , is stretched approximately from &quot;Punta del Capo Rosso&quot; to &quot;Punta Secca&quot; (north-south) and from &quot;Punta San Francesco&quot; to &quot;Punta della Salvezza&quot; (west-east). The soil is calcareous and has a rocky and rugged coasts with inlets and caves mainly in the southern part interrupted only by two beaches called &quot;Cala dello Spalmatoio&quot; (on the north-east) and &quot;Cala Maestra&quot; (on the north-west) where the dockings are. The island landscape has three hills: &quot;Poggio del Cannone&quot; (83 m) and &quot;Monte Mario&quot; (78 m) in the northern part and &quot;Poggio Capel Rosso&quot; (93 m), the highest, in the south where the lighthouse is.
==Flora==
The island’s flora is prevalently a high &quot;macchia mediterranea&quot; in the northern part which become &quot;garrigue&quot; in the southern. Plants as &quot;arbutus&quot;, &quot;Myrtus&quot;, &quot;pistacia lentiscus&quot;, mock privet, Mediterranean buckthorn, &quot;juniperus phoenicea&quot; and &quot;limonium sommierianum&quot; knew only on Isola del Giglio and Montecristo, grow up on the island. The mild climate has favoured the growth of plants such as &quot;euphorbia&quot;, palm trees and wild orchids. The marine flora is abundant in sponges, madreporaria, black coral and red coral.

==Fauna==
The island, as all that of the Tuscan Archipelago, is a place where the bird migration take a stop along their seasonal movement from North to South. The Audouin&#x27;s gull, Puffinus yelkouan, western black-eared wheatear, Marmora&#x27;s warbler and European shag are common on the island.

==History==
Giannutri was mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historiae and by the Latin geographer Pomponio Mela in his &quot;de Chorographia&quot;. The island was inhabited by Romans of which are the vestiges of a magnificent Roman villa reopened on 2 July 2015.
Giannutri was abandoned for mysterious reasons from the 3rd century until 805 when Charlemagne donated to the Tre Fontane Abbey some lands, including the island which returned to be inhabited by cenobitic monks and some hermits.

In the following centuries the Island was assigned by emphyteusis to the Aldobrandeschi family of Sovana in 1269, to the Orsini of Pitigliano on June 15, 1410 and to Siena on August 12, 1452 by Pope Nicholas V award.
The island changed several times of rule: Spanish, French and German and for sometimes became refuge of pirates and Saracens until the Treaty of Lunéville which assigned Giannutri to the Kingdom of Etruria in 1801, afterward to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany till the Italian unification in 1861.

In 1806 a small military garrison was sent on the island. On 10 May 1809, a landing party from and HMS &quot;Halcyon&quot; landed on the Pianosa and Giannutri. The landing party destroyed the enemy forts and captured about 100 prisoners during four hours of fighting. British losses were one marine killed and one wounded.

The Minister of Finances Quintino Sella, with a Royal decree, donated the island to the Comune of Giglio in 1865 in order to settle a farm.

In 1908 the Comune sold the island to the family Ruffo della Scaletta which remained the owner until the death of the Prince Rufo. In the 1960s and 1970s the real estate investing transformed radically the island; in a few years a holiday resort at &quot;Cala Spalmatoio&quot; and many houses scattered through the island were built. The Società Porto Romano declared bankruptcy and the numerous owners of the houses were obliged to form a society, called &quot;Libero Consorzio Giannutri&quot;, in order to administer the island.

==Roman villa==

&quot;Villa Domizia,&quot; also known as &quot;Villa Domitia&quot; was built probably in the 1st or 2nd century by the Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus who was the owner of the island. The Villa is placed in the central part of the island on a height, close to Punta Scaletta and Cala Maestra; the Villa and its annexes are under the control of Italy’s Ministry of Cultural Heritage.
The rooms employed as residence and the others were disposed on the highest level accessible by stairs; on the same level was a terrace from which to watch the Argentario coast. In the back of the residential quarter are the remains of a long building, with 8 rooms aligned, likely used by the monks as convent and since then called &quot;Conventaccio&quot;.

The Villa is connected to &quot;Cala Maestra&quot; through a set of stairs. The Calidarium, formed by a rectangular room from whose walls passed the warm air, was placed halfway between the Villa and &quot;Cala Maestra&quot; and was richly adorned with marbles and mosaic floor. The Romans built a small harbour and a wharf at &quot;Cala Maestra&quot; cutting the rock in order to have more space. The Villa was provided with a cistern to collect the rain water since the island is lack of springs; the water produced today by a desalination plant is collected in the same cistern. In the 1980s a short, grassy airstrip was built and used for a short time at &quot;Punta San Francesco&quot;, later was abandoned.

==National park==
The island and adjacent sea environs are within the Arcipelago Toscano National Park and marine sanctuary. The island is mainly privately owned, with some areas owned by Italy’s Ministry of the Environment it is involved in the Coastal Area Management Programme issued by Ministry of the Environment.
