<text>Todd McFarlane (; born March 16, 1961) is a Canadian comic-book creator, best known for his work as the artist on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and as the creator, writer, and artist on the superhero horror-fantasy series &quot;Spawn,&quot; as well as being the current President and a co-founder of Image Comics.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, McFarlane became a comic-book superstar due to his high-selling work on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Spider-Man&quot; franchise, on which he was the artist to draw the first full appearances of the character Venom. In 1992, he helped form Image Comics, pulling the occult anti-hero character Spawn from his high-school portfolio and updating him for the 1990s. The debut issue sold 1.7 million copies, which, as of 2007, remains a record for an independent comic book. The character&#x27;s popularity in the 1990s also encouraged a trend in creator-owned comic-book properties.

After leaving inking duties on &quot;Spawn&quot; with issue No. 70 (February 1998), McFarlane has illustrated comic books less often, focusing on entrepreneurial efforts, such as McFarlane Toys and Todd McFarlane Entertainment, a film and animation studio. In September 2006, it was announced that McFarlane would be the Art Director of the newly formed 38 Studios, founded by Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling. McFarlane used to be a co-owner of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers before selling his shares to Daryl Katz. He is also a high-profile collector of record-breaking baseballs.

As a filmmaker, he produced the 1997 film adaptation of &quot;Spawn&quot; starring Michael Jai White. He will make his directorial debut with 2025’s reboot film - &quot;King Spawn&quot; which will star Jamie Foxx.

==Early life==
Todd McFarlane was born on March 16, 1961, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to Bob and Sherlee McFarlane. He is the second of three sons, which McFarlane says contributed to his competitive streak. Bob worked in the printing business, which led him to take work where he could find it, and as a result, during McFarlane&#x27;s childhood, the family lived in thirty different places from Alberta to California.
McFarlane began drawing as a hobby at an early age, and developed an interest in comics, acquiring as many as he could and learning to draw from them. He was a fan of comics creators such as John Byrne, Jack Kirby, Frank Miller and George Pérez, as well as the writing of Alan Moore. (John Parker of ComicsAlliance has also noted the influence of Walt Simonson in McFarlane&#x27;s work.) McFarlane created the character Spawn when he was 16, and spent &quot;countless hours&quot; perfecting the appearance of each component of the character&#x27;s visual design.

One day while in the twelfth grade at Calgary&#x27;s William Aberhart High School, McFarlane, working as a groundskeeper for the Calgary Cardinals, was standing in the bleachers when a 13-year-old ninth grader sitting near him named Wanda Kolomyjec, who served as the team&#x27;s bat girl, began flirting with him. The two began dating, over the objections of Wanda&#x27;s father, who thought she was too young for him, though in time McFarlane won him over.

Right after high school, McFarlane attended baseball tryouts at Gonzaga University. Despite being a good fielder and fast, he was not a good hitter. Moreover, he could not afford Gonzaga, so he attended Spokane Falls Community College for a year, his relationship with Wanda developing into a long-distance one. In 1981 McFarlane began attending Eastern Washington University (EWU) on a baseball scholarship, studying as part of a self-designed program for graphics and art. His practical goal was to join his father in the printing business in Calgary, Alberta, though his dream was always to be a comic book creator. He worked part-time on campus as a janitor in the school&#x27;s administration building, as his scholarship required an on-campus job, and also worked weekends at a comics shop called the Comic Rack, devoting a couple of hours late at night to practice his comics art.

He sought to play baseball professionally after graduation but suffered a serious ankle injury in his junior year during a game with arch-rivals Washington State University. He subsequently focused on drawing, working at the comic book store to pay for the rest of his education, and living in a trailer park in Cheney, Washington with Wanda, who had moved to the area to be with him and attend EWU as well. In 1984, a year after his injury, McFarlane&#x27;s final chance to play for the big leagues came when he tried out with the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27; farm team in Medicine Hat, Alberta, but he ended up being ranked last on the roster, ending his professional baseball prospects. McFarlane graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree that same year. He stayed in Spokane, Washington while Wanda finished her degree. She also co-plotted and edited the pages on which McFarlane developed his own comics character, &quot;Spawn&quot;.

==Career==
===Early work, DC, and Marvel===

While still in college, McFarlane began sending 30–40 packages of submissions each month to comics editors, totaling over 700 submissions after a year and a half, most of which were in the form of pinups. Half resulted in no response, while the other half resulted in rejection letters, though he received some constructive criticism from a few editors. One of them, DC Comics&#x27; Sal Amendola, gave McFarlane a dummy script to gauge McFarlane&#x27;s page-to-page storytelling ability. Amendola&#x27;s advice that McFarlane&#x27;s submissions needed to focus on page-to-page stories rather than pinups led McFarlane to create a five-page &quot;Coyote&quot; sample that he initially sent to &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; editor Ann Nocenti at Marvel Comics, who passed it along to Archie Goodwin and Jo Duffy, the editors of the Marvel imprint Epic Comics, which published &quot;Coyote&quot;; these in turn passed it onto &quot;Coyote&quot; creator Steve Englehart, who contacted McFarlane in 1984 with an offer for Todd&#x27;s first comic job: a backup story in &quot;Coyote&quot; #11.

McFarlane soon began drawing for both DC and Marvel, with his first major body of work being a two-year run (1985–1987) on DC&#x27;s &quot;Infinity, Inc.&quot; In 1987, McFarlane illustrated the last three issues of &quot;Detective Comics&quot;&#x27; four-issue &quot;&quot; storyline. From there, he moved to Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot;, which he drew from 1987 to 1988, working with writer Peter David.

====&quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;====
In 1988, McFarlane joined writer David Michelinie on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, beginning with issue 298, drawing the preliminary sketch for that cover&#x27;s image on the back of one of his &quot;Incredible Hulk&quot; pages. McFarlane garnered notice for the more dynamic poses in which he depicted Spider-Man&#x27;s aerial web-swinging, his enlarging of the eyes on the character&#x27;s mask, and the greater detail in which he rendered his artwork—in particular, the elaborate detail he gave to Spider-Man&#x27;s webbing. Whereas it had previously been rendered as essentially a series of X&#x27;s between two lines, McFarlane embellished it by detailing far more individual strands, which came to be dubbed &quot;spaghetti webbing&quot;. (McFarlane was possibly influenced by artist Arthur Adams, whose visual conception of Spider-Man with a large-eyed mask, webbing with more detailed strands, and more contorted poses while web-swinging, can be seen in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; Annual #2, published in June 1986 – approximately 1½ years before McFarlane&#x27;s first published Spider-Man work.) McFarlane drew the first full appearance of Eddie Brock, the original incarnation of the villain Venom. He has been credited as the character&#x27;s co-creator, though this has been a topic of dispute within the comic book industry (&quot;see Eddie Brock: Creation and conception&quot;).

McFarlane&#x27;s work on &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; made him an industry superstar. His cover art for &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 313, for which he was originally paid $700 in 1989, for example, later sold for $71,200 in 2010. One critic of McFarlane&#x27;s detail-heavy style was &quot;Comics Journal&quot; editor Gary Groth, who said of McFarlane in a 2017 interview, &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have any authentic virtues as a visual stylist. His work is so overembellished that it disguises the fact that the composition is chaotic and cluttered to the point of being almost unreadable. He never really learned the craft of comics — he just faked it really well.&quot;

During his run on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, McFarlane became increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of control over his work, as he wanted more say in the direction of storylines. He began to miss deadlines, requiring guest artists to fill in for him on some issues. In 1990, after a 28-issue run of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, McFarlane told editor Jim Salicrup that he wanted to write his own stories, and would be leaving the book with issue No. 328, which was part of that year&#x27;s company-wide &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; crossover storyline. In July 2012 the original artwork to that issue&#x27;s cover, which features Spider-Man dispatching the Hulk, sold for a record-breaking $657,250 USD, the highest auction price ever for any piece of American comic book art. McFarlane was succeeded on &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; by McFarlane&#x27;s future fellow Image Comics co-founder Erik Larsen.

====New &quot;Spider-Man&quot; title====

Wanting to appease McFarlane, Marvel gave McFarlane a new, adjectiveless &quot;Spider-Man&quot; title for him to both write and draw. &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #1 (August 1990) sold 2.5 million copies, largely due to the variant covers with which Marvel, seeking to capitalize on McFarlane&#x27;s popularity, published the issue to encourage collectors into buying more than one edition. This practice was a result of the comics speculator bubble of the 1990s, which would burst later that decade. McFarlane, unbeknownst to his parents at the time, was making about a million dollars a year. McFarlane wrote and illustrated 15 of the series&#x27; first 16 issues, many issues of which featured other popular Marvel characters such as Wolverine and Ghost Rider in guest roles.

Despite his acclaim as an artist, according to David Wallace of Comics Bulletin, many found McFarlane&#x27;s writing to be &quot;clumsy, unsophisticated and pretentious&quot;, and questioned the wisdom of allowing him to write a new &quot;Spider-Man&quot; title in the first place. At the same time, the editorial had problems with the dark tone of the stories McFarlane was telling, beginning with the inaugural &quot;Torment&quot; storyline, which depicted a more vicious version of the reptilian villain Lizard under the control of the voodoo priestess Calypso. Subsequent storylines such as &quot;Masques&quot; featured Spider-Man confronting the demonic Hobgoblin, while &quot;Perceptions&quot;, which involved Spider-Man dealing with police corruption, child rape, and murder (a hint of the work he would later do on &quot;Spawn&quot;), led some stores to refuse to stock the book. This created further tensions between McFarlane and the editorial, which viewed Spider-Man as a historically light-hearted character marketed to young readers. Editor Jim Salicrup in particular was required to make a number of compromises for McFarlane&#x27;s work, including enforcing McFarlane&#x27;s minor costume changes across the entire line of other Spidey comics, placing limitations on his choice of villains for his stories, and dealing with strong disagreement on the handling of the character Mary Jane Watson. This strained McFarlane&#x27;s relationship with Salicrup, which was expressed in the remarkable amount of public disagreement that appeared on the book&#x27;s letters page. Eventually, McFarlane&#x27;s attention to his deadlines again began to waiver, and he missed issue 15 of the title. His final issue on the book, #16 (November 1991), was part of a crossover storyline with &quot;X-Force&quot;, and led to creative clashes with new editor Danny Fingeroth. According to McFarlane and editor Tom DeFalco in the 2000 documentary &quot;The Devil You Know: Inside the Mind of Todd McFarlane&quot;, among the examples of the issues that prompted his departure were editorial&#x27;s censorship of a panel in that issue in which the character Juggernaut was graphically stabbed in the eye with a sword. DeFalco supported the editing of the panel, calling it &quot;inappropriate&quot;, while McFarlane called this &quot;lunacy&quot;, arguing that such graphic visuals are commonplace in Marvel&#x27;s books. Fed up with editorial interference, he left the company under something of a cloud. According to Wallace, &quot;McFarlane&#x27;s fifteen issues of Spider-Man are now (perhaps slightly unfairly) held up alongside the likes of &quot;X-Force&quot; as the epitome of everything wrong in 1990s comics, and their cash-in approach to the then-booming speculator market precipitated the near-collapse of the industry.&quot;

===Image Comics===
McFarlane then teamed with six other popular artists to form Image Comics, an umbrella company under which each owned a publishing house. McFarlane&#x27;s studio, Todd McFarlane Productions, Inc. (TMP), published his creation, the occult-themed &quot;Spawn&quot;, written and drawn by McFarlane. It was Image&#x27;s second release, following the release of Rob Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;Youngblood&quot; the month prior. Upon its release in 1992, &quot;Spawn&quot; #1 (May 1992) sold 1.7 million copies; as of 2007, this remains a record for an independent comic book.
Responding to harsh criticism of his abilities as a writer, McFarlane hired acclaimed writers to guest-write issues #8–11, including Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Dave Sim, and Frank Miller. Subsequent writers he would hire on the series included Grant Morrison, Andrew Grossberg, and Tom Orzechowski. Greg Capullo penciled several issues as a guest artist, and became the regular penciler with #26, with McFarlane remaining as writer and inker until #70. The series continued to be a hit, and in 1993 &quot;Wizard&quot; declared &quot;Spawn&quot; &quot;the best-selling comic on a consistent basis that is currently being published.&quot; &quot;Spawn&quot; is notable for being one of only two Image books that debuted during the company&#x27;s 1992 launch, along with Erik Larsen&#x27;s &quot;Savage Dragon&quot;, that continued to be published into the 2020s.

During Image&#x27;s early years of operation, the company was subject to much industry criticism over aspects of its business practices, including late-shipped books, and its creators&#x27; emphasis on art over writing. One of these critics was McFarlane&#x27;s former &quot;Hulk&quot; collaborator, writer Peter David. This came to a head during a public debate they participated in at Philadelphia&#x27;s Comicfest convention in October 1993, which was moderated by artist George Pérez. McFarlane stated that Image was not being treated fairly by the media, and by David in particular. The three judges, Maggie Thompson, editor of the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, William Christensen of &quot;Wizard Press&quot;, and John Danovich of the magazine &quot;Hero Illustrated&quot;, voted 2–1 in favor of David, with Danovich voting the debate a tie.

In 1994, McFarlane and DC Comics collaborated on an intercompany crossover, each producing a book featuring Batman and Spawn. The first of the two books, &quot;Batman-Spawn: War Devil&quot; was written by Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, and Alan Grant, drawn by Klaus Janson, and published by DC. It was followed by &quot;Spawn/Batman&quot;, which was written by Frank Miller and drawn by McFarlane. That year marked the point when McFarlane ceased to be the regular writer and artist of &quot;Spawn&quot;. The first issue that he did not draw was issue 16, which was drawn by Greg Capullo. Aside from the four fill-in writers on issues #8–11, it was the first issue on which McFarlane was not the regular writer, as it was the first of a three-issue storyline written by Grant Morrison. Over the ensuing decades, he would hire other writers such as Brian Holguin and David Hine, and artists such as Whilce Portacio, Angel Medina, and Philip Tan. McFarlane occasionally offered story input and inked covers. He would sporadically return as the interior artist for intermittent issues, and for a few years wrote it under a pseudonym to generate interest in the book by fostering the illusion that new talent was being brought into the book&#x27;s production.

In 2006, McFarlane announced plans for &quot;Spawn/Batman&quot; with artist Greg Capullo, which McFarlane wrote and inked, and which paid tribute to Jack Kirby. He also began taking an active role in comics publishing again, publishing collections of his &quot;Spawn&quot; comics in trade paperback form. &quot;Spawn Collection&quot; Volume 1 collecting issues 1–12 minus issue 9 (due to royalty issues with Neil Gaiman) and 10 (due to a vow he made to Sim) was released in December 2005. The first volume achieved moderate success, ranking 17 in the top one hundred graphic novels, with pre-order sales of 3,227 for that period.

In 2008, McFarlane returned to co-plot the series with returning writer Brian Holguin, with issue 185. The book survived the comics speculator bubble&#x27;s crash, but its sales have fluctuated, never matching the sales figures of the 1990s. Though it continues publication, its appearance on the Diamond Top 300 chart has been intermittent since the mid-2000s. Nonetheless, Shea Hennum of &quot;Paste&quot; magazine has observed of the series, &quot;It&#x27;s a book that, for a time, people continued to buy because of the character instead of the creator. It has become as much of an institution as it is a comic.

&quot;Haunt&quot;, an ongoing series co-created by McFarlane and Robert Kirkman, was announced in 2007 and launched on October 7, 2009. The comic was initially written by Kirkman, penciled by Ryan Ottley, and inked by McFarlane, with Greg Capullo providing layouts. McFarlane contributed pencils to some issues, and co-wrote issue 28, the series finale, with Joe Casey, who took over writing duties from Kirkman.

In 2019, McFarlane wrote and drew &quot;Spawn&quot; #301, surpassing Dave Sim&#x27;s 300-issue series &quot;Cerebus&quot; as the longest-running creator-owned comics series. The book, released on October 2 of that year, earned McFarlane a place in the Guinness World Records, for which McFarlane was given a certificate on October 5, 2019 at the New York Comic Con, prior to his panel, &quot;The Road to Historic Spawn 300 and 301.&quot;
At San Diego Comic-Con 2022, it was announced that McFarlane would write a new Batman/Spawn crossover, with Greg Capullo as artist, and a release date of December 2022.

===Todd McFarlane Entertainment===

Todd McFarlane Productions published multiple Spawn spin-offs and mini-series. He increasingly concentrated his attention on those other ventures, which resulted in more sporadic work as an illustrator. In 1994, McFarlane created a toy company, Todd Toys, initially to merchandise collectible action figures of the &quot;Spawn&quot; characters. In three months, the company sold more than 2.2 million of the action figures nationwide. After Mattel sent a cease-and-desist order based on a male doll in Mattel&#x27;s Barbie line named Todd, McFarlane changed the company name to McFarlane Toys. The company&#x27;s line of figures quickly expanded to those of popular cultural icons, such as members of the band Kiss, characters from the film franchise &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, TV series such as &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and sports figures such as Terrell Owens. In 1999, the company sold over 6 million action figures. As of 2017, the company was the fifth-largest action-figure manufacturer in the United States.

Todd McFarlane produced the album art for Iced Earth&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Spawn&quot;-based concept album &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; and Korn&#x27;s 1998 third studio album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;.

That same year, McFarlane founded Todd McFarlane Entertainment, a film and animation studio. In collaboration with New Line Cinema, it produced the 1997 &quot;Spawn&quot; film and a new Spawn movie, planned in 2008. &quot;Spawn&quot;, while critically panned, was a modest box office success, earning $54.8 million domestically, and almost $33 million worldwide, against a $40 million budget. Todd McFarlane Entertainment also produced the animated series &quot;Todd McFarlane&#x27;s Spawn&quot;, (featuring voice work by actor Keith David) which aired on HBO from 1997 until 1999. Ed Bark of &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; called the series a &quot;very unpleasant viewing experience&quot; and asked &quot;why anyone would want to subject themselves to such a relentlessly grim, gruesome dehumanizing experience.&quot; Nonetheless, the animated series won a 1998 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in Animation.

The studio produced a number of music videos and other animations, including:
*1998: &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; by Pearl Jam – &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included this video in its 2012 list of The Greatest Animated Music Videos.
*1999: &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; by KoЯn – This video debuted at number eight on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on February 9, 1999, and peaking at number 1 on its thirteenth day, February 25. and spent ten non-consecutive days at the top position until its &quot;retirement&quot;, on May 11, 1999. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video and the 1999 Metal Edge Readers&#x27; Choice Award for Music Video of the Year. It was also nominated for a 1999 MTV Video Music Award.
*2002: &quot;The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys&quot; – McFarlane produced the animated sequences in this film by Peter Care, in which the main characters, Tim and Francis, imagine themselves as muscle-bound warriors. Although the consensus at Rotten Tomatoes was equivocal of the sequences&#x27; effectiveness, Armond White of &quot;New York Press&quot; singled them out for praise.
*2002: &quot;Breath&quot; In December of this year, Todd McFarlane directed the music video &quot;Breath&quot; for Canadian hip-hop group Swollen Members that featured Nelly Furtado. 
*2006: &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; by Disturbed – McFarlane, who worked with Greg Capullo on the art for the 2005 album &quot;Ten Thousand Fists&quot;, also created the animated video for the band&#x27;s cover of Genesis&#x27; 1986 single, &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;.
*2022: &quot;Patient Number 9&quot; by Ozzy Osbourne - Co-directed with M. Wartella.

October 2003 saw the release of the Swollen Members album &quot;Heavy&quot;, with Canadian and international covers that were both illustrated by McFarlane.

On July 21, 2011, at San Diego Comic-Con, McFarlane and Stan Lee debuted their new comic, &quot;Blood Red Dragon&quot;. The series is a collaboration with musician Yoshiki and stars a fictionalized version of him.

McFarlane and Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling formed the gaming studio 38 Studios (formerly &quot;Green Monster Games&quot;), to produce role-playing games, with McFarlane overseeing art direction.

In February 2012, the company released its only title, &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot;, a single-player action role-playing game that was a moderate success, but by late May 2012, the company had ceased operation, due to financial difficulties for which it had filed for bankruptcy.

McFarlane was one of several artists to illustrate a variant cover for Kirkman&#x27;s &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; No. 100, which was released July 11, 2012, at San Diego Comic-Con.

In July 2017, Blumhouse Productions announced McFarlane would direct &quot;King Spawn&quot;. McFarlane had by then written a first-draft script. In May 2018, it was announced that Jamie Foxx would portray the titular character. In July 2018, it was reported that Jeremy Renner would be starring alongside Foxx as Detective Twitch. On October 25, 2018, filming was set to begin in June 2019, but was eventually delayed to a later date. In August 2021, it was reported that &quot;Broken City&quot; screenwriter Brian Tucker had been hired to rewrite McFarlane&#x27;s screenplay. In October 2022, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that Scott Silver, Malcolm Spellman, and Matthew Mixon had been hired to pen a new draft on the screenplay, and that Renner&#x27;s continued involvement depended on the new draft&#x27;s outcome. McFarlane expressed doubts about directing the film himself.

In November 2021, McFarlane launched a dedicated television development and production arm of his McFarlane Films, which has signed a first-look deal with production company wiip. As of November 2021, the company has three shows in development: a &quot;Spawn&quot; spin-off &quot;Sam &amp; Twitch&quot;; the stop-motion, animated event series &quot;McFarland&quot;; and a live-action adaptation of the Sean Lewis comic &quot;Thumbs.&quot;

==Sports==
In 1998, McFarlane, an avid baseball fan, paid $2.6 million USD at auction for the baseball that St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire hit for his then record-breaking 70th home run, and $175,000 for Sammy Sosa&#x27;s 66th home run ball.

In June 2003, McFarlane paid about $517,500 at auction for San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds&#x27; October 2001, record-breaking 73rd home run ball. The auction took place at the ESPN Zone in New York&#x27;s Times Square and was featured live on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. When asked by &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Michael Grunwald in a 2007 interview if he was interested in Bonds&#x27; record 756th career home run ball, McFarlane indicated that he was more interested in Bonds&#x27; last home run ball.

McFarlane is a former minority owner of the Edmonton Oilers and designed the logo used on the team&#x27;s alternate third jersey, which debuted in 2001 and was worn through 2007. The Oilers returned to the McFarlane design in 2022 as part of the league&#x27;s Reverse Retro jersey program.

==Other media==
===Video games===
Spawn appears as a guest character in Mortal Kombat 11 and the Xbox version of &quot;Soulcalibur II.&quot; McFarlane also designed the unique character Necrid for the game.

A PlayStation 2 game, &quot;McFarlane&#x27;s Evil Prophecy&quot;, was released in 2004 by Konami. In it, players battle creatures based on a line of Todd McFarlane&#x27;s action figures including classic movie monsters such as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster and Dracula.

In January 2005, McFarlane announced that he was set to produce a half-hour anthology television series for Fox called &quot;Twisted Tales&quot;, based on the Bruce Jones&#x27; comic book to which McFarlane had purchased the rights.
For the release of the video game &quot;Halo 3&quot;, McFarlane was enlisted to design a series of action figures.

In 2011, McFarlane was hired as an artist for the game &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot;, on which his duties included key frame art, storyboards and directing. He also worked on the cancelled &quot;Project Copernicus&quot; by the same developer.

===Media about McFarlane===
Stan Lee interviewed McFarlane in Episode 1 of the 1991 documentary series &quot;The Comic Book Greats&quot;. In 2000, McFarlane was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Devil You Know: Inside the Mind of Todd McFarlane&quot;, directed by Kenton Vaughan. The film first aired on CBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Life and Times&quot; biography series on January 9, 2001.

In &quot;Spidey Cents&quot;, a fourth-season episode of the History reality television series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; which aired in May 2011, a man tries to sell McFarlane&#x27;s original artwork for page 25 of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; No. 316 (June 1989) for $20,000 to the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas. Because the seller lacked the paperwork authenticating the artwork, the Gold &amp; Silver manager Corey Harrison would only pay $1,000 for the page, an offer that the seller declined.

==Legal issues==
McFarlane lost judgments in two lawsuits in the 2000s. The first was a 2002 suit in which McFarlane contested with writer Neil Gaiman over the rights to some supporting Spawn characters created by Gaiman in issue No. 9 of the &quot;Spawn&quot; series and over payment for later works featuring those characters. In 1997, the two signed a deal in which Gaiman would give his share of characters Angela, Medieval Spawn and Cogliostro to McFarlane in exchange for McFarlane&#x27;s share of British superhero Marvelman (in reality, what McFarlane owned were two trademarks for Miracleman logos, not the character, which would become clear only after the lawsuit concluded). This deal was broken by McFarlane, which motivated Gaiman to start the lawsuit. The jury was unanimous in favor of Gaiman. The two were involved in a lengthy dispute over ownership of Miracleman, but no lawsuit has been filed in that dispute. In 2009, Marvel Comics resolved the matter by purchasing the property. The creators settled their dispute over the &quot;Spawn&quot; characters in January 2012. The exact terms of the settlement were not disclosed, though Gaiman retained ownership of Angela, as she became a character in the Marvel Universe when Gaiman began doing work for Marvel in 2013. Bleeding Cool later confirmed that Marvel Comics had completely bought the rights to Angela from Gaiman.

Another suit in which McFarlane became embroiled was a December 2004 suit in which hockey player Tony Twist sued McFarlane because he named a mobster character in &quot;Spawn&quot; after Twist. After a jury initially found McFarlane liable for $24.5 million in damages (reduced to $15 million on appeal), the lawsuit was later settled out of court for $5 million.

In 2012, McFarlane sued his former friend and employee, Al Simmons, from whom the name of Spawn&#x27;s alter ego was derived. According to a lawsuit lodged in Arizona federal court, the real Al Simmons published a book called &quot;The Art of Being Spawn&quot;, in which Simmons purportedly suggests that his own life was the inspiration for the Spawn character. McFarlane&#x27;s position was that Simmons violated the terms of his employment pact and breached his duty of loyalty. The lawsuit was settled in December 2012 when McFarlane agreed with Simmons. The terms of any settlement were not made public.

==Awards and recognition==
McFarlane&#x27;s has won numerous awards, including:
* 1992 National Cartoonists Society Award for Best Comic Book

==Personal life==
McFarlane and his wife Wanda married in 1985. They stayed in Spokane, Washington until 1986, when they moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. They later moved to Portland, Oregon, and then to the Ahwatukee Foothills of Phoenix, Arizona, where they continue to live as of 2007. There, they raised their three children: Cyan, Kate, and Jake. Cyan&#x27;s love of the TV series &quot;Lost&quot; inspired her father&#x27;s decision to produce action figures based on that show, while Kate voiced the young Cyan in the animated &quot;Spawn&quot; TV series. McFarlane&#x27;s offices are located near Phoenix. In &quot;Spawn&quot;, the characters Wanda Blake and Cyan Fitzgerald were named after McFarlane&#x27;s own wife and daughter respectively.

McFarlane stated in a 1992 interview that he was an atheist. He does not consume alcohol, coffee, or tea.

<text>Lucius Afranius (died 46 BC) was an ancient Roman plebeian and a client of Pompey the Great. He served Pompey as a legate during his Iberian campaigns, his eastern campaigns and remained in his service right through to the Civil War. He died in Africa right after the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC.

==Early career==
Lucius Afranius was born into a humble family in Picenum. As a Picentine, he was favoured during his career by Pompey, who was a scion of Picenum&#x27;s most distinguished family. Afranius probably served under Pompey&#x27;s father Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo during the Social War and under Pompey himself during the Civil War.

===Sertorian War===
Afranius served as a legate under Pompey during his campaigns against Marian supporter Quintus Sertorius in Spain. He played a pivotal role at the battle of Sucro in 75 BC. Sertorius attacked Pompey&#x27;s left wing, which was under Afranius&#x27; command. Afranius held until Sertorius&#x27; attention was drawn away by Pompey&#x27;s attack into Sertorius&#x27; own left. When Sertorius moved his forces to counter this, Afranius led an attack against the Sertorian right. This attack routed the enemy and Afranius pursued them into their camp. Afranius&#x27; soldiers caused a great many casualties and began looting the enemy camp and supply train. Meanwhile, Pompey had been routed by Sertorius, and the looting forces of Afranius were attacked by the victorious Sertorians. It was only the timely arrival of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius which turned the tide in Pompey&#x27;s favour.

Despite the unprecedented size of Pompey&#x27;s corps of legates—he received the right to appoint 24 of these senior adjutants—for his scourge of the pirates from the Mediterranean, Afranius did not number amongst them, as his patron chose to cultivate his links with the Roman aristocracy by appointing only men of distinguished family. After the success of this campaign, however, Pompey was given the command in the east and appointed Afranius as his legate for this new campaign. After the initial successes against Mithradates VI of Pontus and Tigranes the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia, Pompey began to pursue the defeated enemy northwards.

Pompey left Armenia under the military supervision of Afranius. Looking to take advantage of a defeated neighbour, Phraates III of Parthia invaded Armenia at Corduene and began pillaging. According to historian Cassius Dio (XXXVII, 5), Afranius retook the district without a conflict with Phraates&#x27; forces. However, Plutarch (&quot;Pompey&quot; 36) asserts that Afranius marched against the Parthians, drove them out of Armenia, and pursued them as far as the district of Arbela (modern Erbil, Iraq) within the borders of the Parthian Empire.

After his second victory over Mithridates, Pompey realised that pursuing him was futile and instead invested forces to defend Pontus from Mithridates&#x27; return. Afranius was given command against the Arabians of Amanus, and his victory against them cleared the way for Pompey&#x27;s advance into Syria.

==Return to Rome and consulship==
After his victorious campaign in the East, Pompey returned to Rome, and Afranius followed. Wishing to have his loyal legate elected as consul, Pompey began bribing the electors lavishly. Despite public knowledge and disapproval of this, Afranius was elected consul in 60, his consular colleague being Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer. During this year, his actions showed a lack of understanding and ability in the management of the civil matters demanded by the office.

==Civil War==

===Legate in Hispania===
When Pompey was granted Hispania (Iberia, comprising modern Spain and Portugal) as a proconsular province, Afranius, together with Marcus Petreius and Marcus Terentius Varro, governed in his stead, Pompey remaining in Rome to manage affairs there.

When Julius Caesar marched on Rome with &quot;legio XIII,&quot; he ordered his legate Gaius Fabius to march on Iberia and to secure the passes through the Pyrenees. Fabius was given command of three legions.

Afranius, with his three legions, was in possession of the passes. Afranius ordered Petreius, in command of two legions in Lusitania, to march for the Pyrenees to combine their forces. Varro was to remain in further Iberia with his two legions.

Fabius, reinforced with three additional veteran legions, advanced to the River Segre, where Afranius&#x27; force, now joined with Petreius&#x27; legions, was encamped. When two of Fabius&#x27; legions marched out to protect foragers and crossed the Segre, the bridge gave way, cutting off the small force. Afranius marched out to engage this smaller force, but Lucius Munatius Plancus, the Caesarian commander, formed up his legions on a rise with a good defence. Despite the size of Afranius&#x27; force, Plancus held. The approach of Caesarian reinforcements commanded by Fabius ended the engagement.

===Ilerda===
Caesar himself arrived to take command of Fabius&#x27; force. He left six cohorts to command the bridge and marched with the rest of his force for Ilerda. Afranius followed. Both forces encamped, but Afranius declined Caesar&#x27;s challenge to battle. Caesar encamped his forces less than half a mile from Afranius&#x27; camp, which was constructed on a hill.

During his time in Iberia, Afranius had trained his legions to use a loose order formation, similar to that used so successfully by the Celtiberians and Lusitani. Caesar mentions the effectiveness of this formation in his Civil War Commentaries (I. XLIV).

Caesar attempted to build a wall separating Afranius&#x27; camp from the town of Ilerda. Afranius, seeing this, sent his army out to deploy on a small hill near the construction area. Caesar&#x27;s men attacked, but Afranius&#x27; tactics almost led to their defeat, with Afranius being pushed back only when Caesar personally led &quot;legio IX&quot; in an attack. Afranius&#x27; soldiers retreated inside the town. There followed a see-saw battle lasting several hours, with neither side gaining advantage. The battle ended with roughly equal casualties, with both Afranius and Caesar counting the battle as a victory. The armies returned to their respective camps.

===Stalemate and defeat===
Afranius ordered the fortification of the small hill which the battle had been fought over. Over the next few days the river flooded, destroying the bridges and leaving Caesar stranded without food on the opposite side of the river from Afranius, who had a large stockpile of food and supplies. Afranius found out that a large supply convoy was approaching Caesar from Gaul, and he set out to attack and capture it. Though he failed to capture it, he did force the convoy to retreat. Afranius and Petreius sent dispatches to Rome claiming victory, and announcing that the war was all but over.

Despite this, Caesar constructed boats and transported a part of his cavalry force over to Afranius&#x27; side of the river. The cavalry set about harassing Afranius&#x27; supply lines, even annihilating a unit of republican reinforcements. Caesar constructed a bridge and began to harass Afranius&#x27; forces with his whole army. At the same time, several Iberian rulers pledged their support to Caesar&#x27;s cause.

Over the next weeks, Afranius attempted unsuccessfully to deal with the Caesarian harassment. Several siegeworks were begun by both Caesarian and Republican troops. Caesar states that during this time, the adversaries were so close that they could talk to each other. The republican troops were convinced to surrender, with even Afranius&#x27; own son attempting to negotiate a surrender. Soon after this, several Caesarian troops were found to have wandered into the Republican camp. Afranius and Petreius ordered their execution. At the same time, several Republican troops had been seen wandering about in Caesar&#x27;s camp. Caesar ordered these men treated with respect and sent back to Afranius.

When Afranius&#x27; men saw Caesar&#x27;s clemency, their mind was made up. Caesar&#x27;s forces stepped up the harassment of Afranius&#x27; troops, and soon food levels were low. Afranius, realising the situation, surrendered to Caesar. According to Caesar&#x27;s commentaries, these were his words:

Caesar pardoned all the Republicans, Afranius included—on the proviso that they did not join up with the Republicans still at large.

==Road to Thapsus==

===Disgrace and return===
In the Republican camp, Atius Rufus charged Afranius with betraying his army. Despite this, Afranius, along with Petreius, broke his word to Caesar, embarked with as many loyal troops as he could gather and sailed for Epirus and Pompey. His Hispanian Cohorts were greatly appreciated by the Republicans, and he was welcomed back into the Republican fold. Afranius took no active command at Dyrrachium or Pharsalus, though he was no doubt there. After the Republican defeat at Pharsalus, Afranius, like most Republicans, fled to Africa.

===Thapsus===
After Caesar landed in Africa Province, his forces were harassed by Numidian light troops commanded by Afranius and his fellow Picentine, Titus Labienus. Upon seeing the treason of Afranius, Caesar ordered his execution upon sight. Afranius then fought under Metellus Scipio at the Battle of Thapsus. After the defeat, Afranius and Faustus Cornelius Sulla, son of Sulla the dictator, gathered some of the survivors of Thapsus and started to pillage eastern Mauretania (its king, Bocchus II, was allied to Caesar). They were ambushed and captured by Publius Sittius (a Roman mercenary commander working for Bocchus). After holding them for several days, the troops guarding them mutinied and killed all the leading Republican prisoners, including Afranius.

<doc id="82475" wikidata="Q901224" url="?curid=82475" title="Daedalion">
<text>In Greek mythology, Daedalion or Daidalion () was a son of Hesperos, the god of the Evening Star or Phosphorus, god of the Morning Star and the brother of Ceyx. Ceyx describes his brother Daedalion as a great warrior, full of courage and vigour but acknowledged that he could also be harsh, relishing the cruelty of war. The story of Daedalion&#x27;s life is told mainly in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; though passing references can be found in other classical works. It is possible the story may have originated with Boios. In the tale Daedalion, grief-stricken following the death of his daughter Chione, attempts to cast himself off Mount Parnassus only to be transformed into a hawk by Apollo.

== Mythology ==
=== Beautiful daughter ===
Daedalion&#x27;s daughter Chione was said to be so beautiful that she was the object of a thousand men&#x27;s desire the moment she turned fourteen. As it transpired, Chione&#x27;s admirers were not limited to mortal men. Whilst returning from visits to earth, both Apollo and Hermes caught sight of Chione and were filled with a burning lust. Apollo decided to wait until night fell; however, Hermes was not so patient. Through the use of magic, he caused Chione to fall into a deep sleep and proceeded to rape her. Later that evening, Apollo also visited her in the guise of an old woman. As a result of these two divine visitations Chione gave birth to twins. By Hermes she gave birth to Autolycus who grew into a notorious thief and charlatan. By Apollo she bore Philammon, a man famed both for his voice and skill with a lyre.

===Death===
The attentions of not one but two gods led Chione to boast that her beauty exceeded even that of Artemis. To avenge this personal slight, not to mention blasphemy, Artemis struck Chione down by shooting an arrow straight through her tongue. Her father, Daedalion, was overcome with grief despite his brother&#x27;s best efforts to console him. At his daughter&#x27;s funeral Daedalion tried to throw himself onto the pyre three times but was restrained. After a fourth unsuccessful attempt he ran, at an impossible speed, through the fields and the forests, climbed to the summit of Mount Parnassus and jumped. Apollo though took pity on the grieving father, transforming him into a hawk before he could hit the ground. It is said that the hawk&#x27;s great strength, as well as its propensity for hunting other birds, is a result of Daedalion&#x27;s former courage and the rage caused by the death of his daughter.

<doc id="82479" wikidata="Q558230" url="?curid=82479" title="Cholesteatoma">
<text>Cholesteatoma is a destructive and expanding growth consisting of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear and/or mastoid process. Cholesteatomas are not cancerous as the name may suggest, but can cause significant problems because of their erosive and expansile properties. This can result in the destruction of the bones of the middle ear (ossicles), as well as growth through the base of the skull into the brain. They often become infected and can result in chronically draining ears. Treatment almost always consists of surgical removal.

==Signs and symptoms==

Other more common conditions (e.g. otitis externa) may also present with these symptoms, but cholesteatoma is much more serious and should not be overlooked. If a patient presents to a doctor with ear discharge and hearing loss, the doctor should consider cholesteatoma until the disease is definitely excluded. Other less common symptoms (all less than 15%) of cholesteatoma may include pain, balance disruption, tinnitus, earache, headaches and bleeding from the ear. There can also be facial nerve weakness. Balance symptoms in the presence of a cholesteatoma raise the possibility that the cholesteatoma is eroding the balance organs in the inner ear.

Doctors&#x27; initial inspections may only reveal an ear canal full of discharge. Until the doctor has cleaned the ear and inspected the entire tympanic membrane, cholesteatoma cannot be diagnosed. Once the debris is cleared, cholesteatoma can give rise to a number of appearances. If there is significant inflammation, the tympanic membrane may be partially obscured by an aural polyp. If there is less inflammation, the cholesteatoma may present the appearance of &#x27;semolina&#x27; discharging from a defect in the tympanic membrane. The posterior and superior parts of the tympanic membrane are most commonly affected. If the cholesteatoma has been dry, the cholesteatoma may present the appearance of &#x27;wax over the attic&#x27;. The attic is just above the eardrum.

If untreated, a cholesteatoma can eat or cause erosion of the three small bones located in the middle ear (the &quot;malleus&quot;, &quot;incus&quot; and &quot;stapes&quot;, collectively called ossicles). This can result in nerve deterioration, imbalance, vertigo, and deafness early in the disease. It can also affect and erode, through the enzymes it produces, the thin bone structure that isolates the top of the ear from the brain, as well as lay the covering of the brain open to infection with serious complications (rarely even death due to brain abscess and sepsis).

Both the acquired as well as the congenital types of the disease can affect the facial nerve that extends from the brain to the face and passes through the inner and middle ear and leaves at the anterior tip of the mastoid bone, and then rises to the front of the ear and extends into the upper and lower face.

==Cause==
Cholesteatomas occur in two basic classifications: Acquired cholesteatomas, which are more common, are usually caused by pathological alteration of the ear drum leading to accumulation of keratin within the middle ear. Congenital cholesteatomas are usually middle ear epidermal cysts that are identified deep within an intact ear drum often in the superior anterior portion.

Cholesteatomas do not contain cholesterol or fat and should not be confused with cholesterol granulomas.

=== Congenital cholesteatoma ===
Keratin-filled cysts that grow medial to the tympanic membrane are considered to be congenital if they fulfill the following criteria (Levenson&#x27;s criteria):
* mass medial to the tympanic membrane
* normal tympanic membrane
* no previous history of ear discharge, perforation or ear surgery

Congenital cholesteatomas occur at three important sites: the middle ear, the petrous apex, and the cerebropontinio angle. They are most often found deep to the anterior aspect of the ear drum, and a vestigial structure, the epidermoid formation, from which congenital cholesteatoma may originate, has been identified in this area.

Not all middle ear epidermal cysts are congenital, as they can be acquired either by metaplasia of the middle ear mucosa or by traumatic implantation of ear canal or tympanic membrane skin. In addition, cholesteatoma inadvertently left by a surgeon usually regrows as an epidermal cyst. Some authors have also suggested hereditary factors.

=== Acquired cholesteatoma ===
More commonly, keratin accumulates in a pouch of tympanic membrane which extends into the middle ear space. This abnormal folding or &#x27;retraction&#x27; of the tympanic membrane arises in one of the following ways:
* Jackler&#x27;s theory: Mucosal coupling with traction generated by interaction of migrating opposing surfaces leading to formation of cholesteatoma.
* Wittmaack&#x27;s theory: Invagination of tympanic membrane from the attic or part of pars tensa in the form of retraction pockets lead to the formation of cholesteatoma.
* Ruedi&#x27;s theory: The basal cells of germinal layer of skin proliferate under the influence of infection and lay down keratinising squamous epithelium.
* Habermann&#x27;s theory: The epithelium from the meatus or outer drum surface grows into the middle ear through a pre-existing perforation and form cholesteatoma.

Cholesteatoma may also arise as a result of metaplasia of the middle ear mucosa or implantation following trauma.

==Diagnosis==
Cholesteatoma is diagnosed by a medical doctor by physical examination of the ear. A CT scan may help to rule out other, often more serious causes for the patient&#x27;s clinical presentation. Non-ionizing radiation imaging techniques (MRI) may be suitable to replace a CT scan, if determined necessary by a physician.

==Treatment==
Cholesteatoma is a persistent disease. Once the diagnosis of cholesteatoma is made in a patient who can tolerate a general anesthetic, the standard treatment is to surgically remove the growth.

The challenge of cholesteatoma surgery is to permanently remove the cholesteatoma whilst retaining or reconstructing the normal functions of the structures housed within the temporal bone.

The general objective of cholesteatoma surgery has two parts. It is both directed against the underlying pathology and directed towards maintaining the normal functions of the temporal bone. These aims are conflicting and this makes cholesteatoma surgery extremely challenging.

Sometimes, the situation results in a clash of surgical aims. The need to fully remove a progressive disease like cholesteatoma is the surgeon&#x27;s first priority. Preservation of hearing is secondary to this primary aim. If the disease can be removed easily so that there is no increased risk of residual disease, then the ossicles may be preserved. If the disease is difficult to remove, so that there is an increased risk of residual disease, then removal of involved ossicles in order to fully clear cholesteatoma has generally been regarded as necessary and reasonable.

In other words, the aims of cholesteatoma treatment form a hierarchy. The paramount objective is the complete removal of cholesteatoma. The remaining objectives, such as hearing preservation, are subordinate to the need for complete removal of cholesteatoma. This hierarchy of aims has led to the development of a wide range of strategies for the treatment of cholesteatoma.

===Surgery===
The variation in technique in cholesteatoma surgery results from each surgeon&#x27;s judgment whether to retain or remove certain structures housed within the temporal bone in order to facilitate the removal of cholesteatoma. This typically involves some form of mastoidectomy which may or may not involve removing the posterior ear canal wall and the ossicles.

Removal of the canal wall facilitates the complete clearance of cholesteatoma from the temporal bone in three ways: 
# It removes a large surface onto which cholesteatoma may be adherent; 
# It removes a barrier behind which the cholesteatoma may be hidden; 
# It removes an impediment to the introduction of instruments used for the removal of cholesteatoma.

Thus removal of the canal wall provides one of the most effective strategies for achieving the primary aim of cholesteatoma surgery, the complete removal of cholesteatoma. However, there is a trade-off, since the functional impact of canal wall removal is also important.

The removal of the ear canal wall results in: 
* a space, the &quot;mastoid cavity&quot;, which is less likely than the original ear canal to resist infection; 
* exposure of the ossicles, which may allow the subsequent formation of a new cholesteatoma deep to the ossicles. To prevent this, these ossicles must be removed, which may diminish the patient&#x27;s hearing.

The formation of a mastoid cavity by removal of the canal wall is the simplest and most effective procedure for facilitating the removal of cholesteatoma, but may bestow the most lasting infirmity due to loss of ear function upon the patient treated in this way.

The following strategies are employed to mitigate the effects of canal wall removal:
# Careful design and construction of the mastoid cavity. This is essential for the health and integrity of the protective sheet of migrating, keratising epithelium which lines the distorted ear canal. This requires the surgeon to saucerise the cavity. A high facial ridge and an inappropriately small cartilaginous meatus are obstructions to epithelial migration and are particularly high risk factors for failure of the self-cleaning mechanism of the external ear.
# Partial obliteration of the mastoid cavity. This can be performed using a wide range of materials. Many of these resorb in time, which means that the long-term results of such surgery are poorer than the short-term results.
# Reconstruction of the ear canal wall. Canal wall reconstruction has been performed using ear canal skin alone, fascia, cartilage and titanium as well as by replacing the original intact wall. If the reconstruction is poorly performed, it may result in a high rate of recurrent cholesteatoma. 
# Preservation of the ear canal wall. If poorly performed, it may result in a high rate of both residual and recurrent cholesteatoma. 
# Reconstruction of the chain of hearing bones using a passive middle ear implant.

Clearly, preservation and restoration of ear function at the same time as total removal of cholesteatoma requires a high level of surgical expertise.
=== Endoscopic surgery ===

Traditionally, ear surgery has been performed using the surgical microscope. The direct line of view dictated by that approach necessitates using the mastoid as the access port to the middle ear. It has long been recognized that failure in cholesteatoma surgery occurs in some of the out of view spaces of the tympanic cavity like the &quot;sinus tympani&quot; and facial recess that are out of view using the traditional microscopic technique. More recently, the endoscope has been increasingly utilized in the surgical management of cholesteatoma in one of two ways:
# Using the endoscope as an ancillary instrument to the microscope when trying to visualize areas that are hidden from the microscope such as the sinus tympani. This work was pioneered by Professor Thomassin. 
# Using the endoscope as the main surgical instrument through the ear canal, or what&#x27;s called: endoscopic ear surgery, pioneered by Professor Tarabichi.
There are multiple advantages for the use of the endoscope in cholesteatoma surgery:

# The endoscope&#x27;s wide angle of view and the ability to &quot;see around the corner&quot;. 
# The endoscope allows minimally invasive access through the natural ear canal, rather than through the usual 5 cm incision behind the ear utilized in traditional microscopic surgery.
# The 30-degree endoscope allows access to the bony area of the Eustachian tube to address any obstructive pathologies.

==Prognosis==
It is important that the patient attend periodic follow-up checks, because even after careful microscopic surgical removal, cholesteatomas may recur. Such recurrence may arise many years, or even decades, after treatment.

A &#x27;residual cholesteatoma&#x27; may develop if the initial surgery failed to completely remove the original; residual cholesteatomas typically become evident within the first few years after the initial surgery.

A &#x27;recurrent cholesteatoma&#x27; is a new cholesteatoma that develops when the underlying causes of the initial cholesteatoma are still present. Such causes can include, for example, poor Eustachian tube function, which results in retraction of the ear drum, and failure of the normal outward migration of skin.

In a retrospective study of 345 patients with middle ear cholesteatoma operated on by the same surgeon, the overall 5-year recurrence rate was 11.8%. In a different study with a mean follow-up period of 7.3 years, the recurrence rate was 12.3%, with the recurrence rate being higher in children than in adults. The use of the endoscope as an ancillary instrument has been shown to reduce the incidence of residual cholesteatoma. Although more studies are needed, so far, new techniques addressing underlying Eustachian tube dysfunction such as transtympanic dilatation of the Eustachian tube has not been shown to change outcomes of chronic ear surgery.

==Infections==
Recent findings indicate that the keratinizing squamous epithelium of the middle ear could be subjected to human papillomavirus infection. Indeed, DNA belonging to oncogenic HPV16 has been detected in cholesteatoma tissues, thereby underlining that keratinizing squamous epithelia could potentially be a target tissue for HPV infection.

==Epidemiology==
In one study, the number of new cases of cholesteatoma in Iowa was estimated in 1975–76 to be just under one new case per 10,000 citizens per year. Cholesteatoma affects all age groups, from infants through to the elderly. The peak incidence occurs in the second decade.

<doc id="82480" wikidata="Q508188" url="?curid=82480" title="Antalcidas">
<text>Antalcidas (; died  BC), son of Leon, was an ancient Greek soldier, politician, and diplomat from Sparta.

==Life==
Antalcidas came from a prominent family and was likely a relation by marriage to the Spartan king Agesilaus II.

Antalcidas is first recorded at the outset of the Corinthian War. Following the end of the Peloponnesian War after the destruction of the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, Sparta had launched a series of raids against the Persian satrapies of Asia Minor. Pharnabazus, satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, finally responded by sending the Rhodian Timocrates to bribe the other Greek city states into declaring war on Sparta. Thebes rose up in 395 BC, eventually encouraging others to join in what became known as the Corinthian War. Persia was now on friendly terms with Athens and Pharnabazus permitted their disgraced general Conon to command his fleet of Phoenician and Cypriot ships in attacks that culminated in the destruction of the Spartan fleet at Cnidus. He was then permitted to return to Athens with part of the fleet and given funds to rebuild the city&#x27;s Long Walls.

Soon afterwards, in 393 or 392 BC, Antalcidas was dispatched to Tiribazus, the satrap of Lydia, to sue for peace. Learning of his mission, Athens sent its own embassy under Conon. The Spartans offered full recognition of Persian supremacy over Asia Minor, and the satrap threw the Athenians in jail. When King Artaxerxes II learned that Antalcidas had further convinced Tiribazus to provide funds for rebuilding Sparta&#x27;s demolished navy, he replaced the satrap with Struthas, who resumed raiding Sparta and her allies. However, the Spartan fleet thus funded regained control of the Gulf of Corinth by the end of the year.
For unknown reasons, Tiribazus was restored to power in Lydia by 388 BC. Antalcidas resumed negotiations and over the next year the pair journeyed to Susa to win the king&#x27;s support for a Persian alliance against Athens. This was granted and Antalcidas was made admiral of Sparta&#x27;s fleets. He pursued a vigorous policy, particularly around the Hellespont, and the Athenians agreed to negotiate with Argos, Sparta, and the Persians at Tiribazus&#x27;s seat at Sardis. By the winter of 387 BC, the Peace of Antalcidas had been arranged, by the terms of which:

# all of Asia Minor, with the islands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, was recognized as subject to Persia, and 
# all other Greek cities—so far they were not already under Persian rule—were to be independent, except Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros, which were returned to the Athenians.

The terms were ratified by the city governments over the next year. The reassertion of Spartan hegemony over Greece by abandoning the Greeks of Aeolia, Ionia, and Caria has been called the &quot;most disgraceful event in Greek history&quot;.

Antalcidas continued in favor with Artaxerxes until the revolting Thebans annihilated Spartan supremacy at Leuctra in 371 BC, diminishing his influence. Plutarch notes a laconic comment made by Antalcidas to Agesilaus after one of the Spartan losses to Thebes, saying in effect, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it amazing how good they&#x27;ve gotten after all of the training we&#x27;ve given them.&quot; That year or possibly in 367 BC, Antalcidas undertook a final mission to Persia. Plutarch held that its failure drove him to starve himself to death.

<text>The King&#x27;s Peace (387 BC) was a peace treaty guaranteed by the Persian King Artaxerxes II that ended the Corinthian War in ancient Greece. The treaty is also known as the Peace of Antalcidas, after Antalcidas, the Spartan diplomat who traveled to Susa to negotiate the terms of the treaty with the king of Achaemenid Persia. The treaty was more commonly known in antiquity, however, as the King&#x27;s Peace, a name that reflects the depth of Persian influence in the treaty, as Persian gold had driven the preceding war. The treaty was a form of Common Peace, similar to the Thirty Years&#x27; Peace which ended the First Peloponnesian War.

==The end of the war==
By 387 BC, the central front of the Corinthian War had shifted from the Greek mainland to the Aegean, where an Athenian fleet under Thrasybulus had successfully placed a number of cities across the Aegean under Athenian control, and was acting in collaboration with Evagoras, the king of Cyprus. Since Evagoras was an enemy of Persia, and many of the Athenian gains threatened Persian interests, these developments prompted Artaxerxes to switch his support from Athens and her allies to Sparta. Antalcidas, the commander of a Spartan fleet, was summoned to Susa, along with the satrap, Tiribazus. There, the Spartans and Persians worked out the form of an agreement to end the war.

To bring the Athenians to the negotiating table, Antalcidas then moved his fleet of 90 ships to the Hellespont, where he could threaten the trade routes along which the Athenians imported grain from the Black Sea region. The Athenians, mindful of their disastrous defeat in 404 BC, when the Spartans had gained control of the Hellespont, agreed to negotiate, and Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, unwilling to fight on without Athens, were also forced to negotiate. In a peace conference at Sparta, all the belligerents agreed to the terms laid down by Artaxerxes.

==Terms of the peace==
The most notable feature of the King&#x27;s Peace is the Persian influence it reflects. The Persian decree that established the terms of the peace, as recorded by Xenophon, clearly shows this:

Ionia and Cyprus were abandoned to the Persians, and the Athenians were compelled to cede their newly-won territories in the Aegean. Equally significantly, the insistence on autonomy put an end to a novel political experiment that had grown out of the war, the union of Argos and Corinth. In what the Greeks called &quot;sympoliteia&quot;, the two cities had politically merged, granting all citizens joint citizenship. They were forced to separate, and the Thebans were required to disband their Boeotian league. Only Sparta&#x27;s Peloponnesian League and helots were overlooked, as the Spartans, who were responsible for administering the peace, had no wish to see the principle of independence applied there.
==Effects==

The single greatest effect of the Peace was the return of firm Persian control over Ionia and parts of the Aegean. Driven back from the Aegean shores by the Delian League during the 5th century, the Persians had been recovering their position since the later part of the Peloponnesian War of 431 to 404 BC, and were now strong enough to dictate terms to Greece. They would maintain this position of strength until the time of Alexander the Great (). As Mikhail Gasparov states in his book &quot;Greece for Entertainment&quot; (&quot;&quot;), &quot;Artaxerxes had succeeded where Xerxes had failed; the Persian King was giving orders in Greece like it was his, and without bringing in a single soldier at that.&quot; In short, the treaty placed Greece under Persian suzerainty.
A second effect of this &quot;most disgraceful event in Greek history&quot;, as Will Durant characterized it, was the establishment of Sparta in a formalized position at the top of a Greek political system enforced by the Great King. Using their mandate to protect and enforce the peace, the Spartans proceeded to launch a number of campaigns against &quot;poleis&quot; that they perceived as political threats. Near at hand, they forced the city of Mantinea in Arcadia, to disband into its constituent villages. The largest intervention was a campaign in 382 BC to break up the federalist Chalcidian League in northeastern Greece, as violating the autonomy principle of the Great King&#x27;s decree. On the way there, in 383 the Spartan commander Phoebidas, invited by a pro-Spartan faction, seized the Theban Kadmeia (the Theban acropolis) and left a Laconophile oligarchy supported by a Spartan garrison; even the pro-Spartan Xenophon could only attribute the act to madness. The principle of autonomy proved to be a flexible tool in the hand of a hegemonic power.

The King&#x27;s Peace was not successful in bringing peace to Greece. Pelopidas and companions liberated Thebes in 379 by assassinating the Laconizing tyrants. After the Spartan campaign against Olynthus in 382-379 BC, general fighting resumed (Boeotian War of 378 to 371 BC) with the revived Athenian naval confederacy and continued, with intermittent attempts to restore the peace, for much of the next two decades. The idea of a Common Peace proved enduring, however, and numerous attempts would be made to establish one, with little more success than the original. By granting powers to Sparta that were sure to infuriate other states when used, the treaties sowed the seeds of their own demise, and a state of near-constant warfare continued to be the norm in Greece.

<text>In Greek mythology, Ariadne (; ; ) was a Cretan princess, the daughter of King Minos of Crete. There are variations of Ariadne&#x27;s myth, but she is known for helping Theseus escape from the Minotaur and being abandoned by him on the island of Naxos. There, Dionysus saw Ariadne sleeping, fell in love with her, and later married her. Many versions of the myth recount Dionysus throwing Ariadne&#x27;s jeweled crown into the sky to create a constellation, the Corona Borealis.

Ariadne is associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of Theseus and the Minotaur.

There are also festivals held in Cyprus and Naxos in Ariadne&#x27;s honor.

==Etymology==
Greek lexicographers in the Hellenistic period claimed that &quot;Ariadne&quot; is derived from the ancient Cretan dialectical elements &quot;ari&quot; (ἀρι-) &quot;most&quot; (which is an intensive prefix) and &quot;adnós&quot; (ἀδνός) &quot;holy&quot;. Conversely, Stylianos Alexiou has argued that despite the belief being that Ariadne&#x27;s name is of Indo-European origin, it is actually pre-Greek.

Linguist Robert S. P. Beekes has also supported Ariadne having a pre-Greek origin; specifically being Minoan from Crete because her name includes the sequence &quot;dn&quot; (δν), rare in Indo-European languages and an indication that it is a Minoan loanword.

==Family==
Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, the King of Crete and son of Zeus, and of Pasiphaë, Minos&#x27; queen and daughter of Helios. Others denominated her mother Crete, daughter of Asterius, the husband and King of Europa.

Ariadne was the sister of Acacallis, Androgeus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Glaucus, Xenodice, and Catreus. Through her mother, Pasiphaë, she was also the half-sister of the Minotaur (who was known in Crete as Asterion).

Ariadne married Dionysus and became the mother of Oenopion, the personification of wine, Staphylus, who was associated with grapes, as well as Thoas, Peparethus, Eurymedon, Phliasus, Ceramus, Maron, Euanthes, Latramys, and Tauropolis.

==Mythology==
Minos put Ariadne in charge of the labyrinth where sacrifices were made as part of reparations either to Poseidon or Athena, depending on the version of the myth; later, she helped Theseus conquer the Minotaur and save the children from sacrifice. In other narrations she was the bride of Dionysus, her status as mortal or divine varying in those accounts.

===Minos and Theseus===
Because ancient Greek myths were orally transmitted, like other myths, that of Ariadne has many variations. According to an Athenian version, Minos attacked Athens after his son, Androgeus, was killed there. The Athenians asked for terms and were required to sacrifice 7 young men and 7 maidens to the Minotaur every 1, 7 or 9 years (depending on the source). One year, the sacrificial party included Theseus, the son of King Aegeus, who volunteered in order to kill the Minotaur. At first sight, Ariadne fell in love with him and provided him a sword and ball of thread (ο Μίτος της Αριάδνης, &quot;Ariadne&#x27;s string&quot;) so that he could retrace his way out of the labyrinth of the Minotaur.

Ariadne betrayed her father and her country for her lover Theseus. She eloped with Theseus after he killed the Minotaur, yet according to Homer in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; &quot;he had no joy of her, for ere that, Artemis slew her in seagirt Dia because of the witness of Dionysus&quot;. The phrase &quot;seagirt Dia&quot; refers to the uninhabited island of Dia, which lies off the northern coast of the Greek island of Crete in the Mediterranean Sea. Dia may have referred to the island of Naxos.

Most accounts claim that Theseus abandoned Ariadne on Naxos, and in some versions Perseus mortally wounds her. According to some, Dionysus claimed Ariadne as wife, therefore causing Theseus to abandon her. Homer does not elaborate on the nature of Dionysus&#x27; accusation, yet the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot; speculated that she was already married to him when she eloped with Theseus. According to Plutarch, Paion the Amathusian recounted Theseus accidentally abandoned Ariadne only to come back when it was too late.

=== Naxos ===

In Hesiod and in most other versions, Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on Naxos, and Dionysus rediscovered and wedded her. In a few versions of the myth, Dionysus appeared to Theseus as they sailed from Crete, saying that he had chosen Ariadne as his wife and demanding that Theseus leave her on Naxos for him; this had the effect of absolving the Athenian cultural hero of desertion. The vase painters of Athens often depicted Athena leading Theseus from the sleeping Ariadne to his ship.

Ariadne bore Dionysus famous children, including Oenopion, Staphylus, and Thoas. Dionysus set her wedding diadem in the heavens as the constellation Corona Borealis. Ariadne was faithful to Dionysus. In one version of her myth, Perseus killed her at Argos by turning her to stone with the head of Medusa during Perseus&#x27; war with Dionysus. The &quot;Odyssey&quot; relates that Theseus took Ariadne away from Crete only for Artemis to kill her in Dia (usually identified with Naxos) on Dionysus&#x27; witness. An ancient scholiast wrote that Ariadne and Theseus had sex on a sacred grove, and an angry Dionysus revealed that to Artemis, who proceeded to punish Ariadne with death.

According to Plutarch, one version of the myth tells that Ariadne hanged herself after being abandoned by Theseus. Dionysus then went to Hades, and brought her and his mother Semele to Mount Olympus, where they were deified.

Some scholars have posited, because of Ariadne&#x27;s associations with thread-spinning and winding, that she was a weaving goddess,
like Arachne, and support this theory with the mytheme of the Hanged Nymph
(see weaving in mythology).

==As a goddess==
Karl Kerenyi and Robert Graves theorized that Ariadne, whose name they thought derived from Hesychius&#x27; enumeration of &quot;Άδνον&quot;, a Cretan-Greek form of &quot;arihagne&quot; (&quot;utterly pure&quot;), was a Great Goddess of Crete, &quot;the first divine personage of Greek mythology to be immediately recognized in Crete&quot;, once archaeological investigation began. Kerenyi observed that her name was merely an epithet and claimed that she was originally the &quot;Mistress of the Labyrinth&quot;, both a winding dancing ground and, in the Greek opinion, a prison with the dreaded Minotaur in its centre. Kerenyi explained that a Linear B inscription from Knossos &quot;to all the gods, honey… [,] to the mistress of the labyrinth honey&quot; in equal amounts, implied to him that the Mistress of the Labyrinth was a Great Goddess in her own right. Professor Barry Powell suggested that she was the Snake Goddess of Minoan Crete.

Plutarch, in his Life of Theseus, which treats him as a historical person, reported that in contemporary Naxos was an earthly Ariadne, who was distinct from a divine one:
In a kylix by the painter Aison (), Theseus drags the Minotaur from a temple-like labyrinth, yet the goddess who attends him in this Attic representation is Athena.

An ancient cult of Aphrodite-Ariadne was observed at Amathus, Cyprus, according to the obscure Hellenistic mythographer Paeon of Amathus; his works are lost, but his narrative is among the sources that Plutarch cited in his &quot;vita&quot; of Theseus (20.3–5). According to the myth that was current at Amathus, the second most important Cypriot cult centre of Aphrodite, Theseus&#x27; ship was swept off course and the pregnant and suffering Ariadne put ashore in the storm. Theseus, attempting to secure the ship, was inadvertently swept out to sea, thus being absolved of abandoning Ariadne. The Cypriot women cared for Ariadne, who died in childbirth and was memorialized in a shrine. Theseus, overcome with grief upon his return, left money for sacrifices to Ariadne and ordered two cult images, one of silver and one of bronze, erected.

At the observation in her honour on the second day of the month , a young man lay on the ground and vicariously experienced the throes of labour. The sacred grove in which the shrine was located was denominated the &quot;Grove of Aphrodite-Ariadne&quot;. According to Cypriot legend, Ariadne&#x27;s tomb was located within the &quot;temenos&quot; of the sanctuary of Aphrodite-Ariadne. The primitive nature of the cult at Amathus in this narrative appears to be much older than the Athenian sanctioned shrine of Aphrodite, who at Amathus received &quot;Ariadne&quot; (derived from &quot;hagne&quot;, &quot;sacred&quot;) as an epithet.

===Libera===
The Roman author Hyginus identified Ariadne as the Roman Libera, bride to Liber.

==Festivals==

Ariadneia (ἀριάδνεια) festivals honored Ariadne and were held in Naxos and Cyprus. According to Plutarch, some Naxians believed there were two Ariadnes, one of which died on the island of Naxos after being abandoned by Theseus. The Ariadneia festival honors Naxos as the place of her death with sacrifices and mourning. Paeon, as stated by Plutarch, attributes the Ariadneia festival in Cyprus to Theseus, who left money to the island so sacrifices could be made to commemorate Ariadne. Sacrifices were held in the grove of Ariadne Aphrodite, where Ariadne&#x27;s tomb resided. During these sacrifices, a young man shall lie down and mimic a woman in labour by crying out and gesturing on the second day of the month, . One silver and one bronze statuette were also constructed in her honor.

==In Etruscan culture==
Ariadne, in Etruscan &quot;Areatha&quot;, is paired with Dionysus, in Etruscan &quot;Fufluns&quot;, on Etruscan engraved bronze mirror backs, where the Athenian cultural hero Theseus is absent, and Semele, in Etruscan &quot;Semla&quot;, as mother of Dionysus, may accompany the pair, lending an especially Etruscan air of familial authority.

<text>In Greek mythology, Himeros (, lit. &#x27;desire&#x27;) is one of the seven Erotes, a group of winged love deities, and part of Aphrodite&#x27;s procession. Often described as &quot;sweet&quot;, he is the god and personification of desire and lust. In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Eros and Himeros were present at Aphrodite&#x27;s birth and escorted the goddess as she emerged out of the sea foam and joined the assembly of the gods. Earlier in Theogony, Himeros is mentioned as a resident of Mount Olympus, being a neighbor of the Muses and the Charites. Himeros (desire) and Philotes (affection) were bestowed upon the world by Aphrodite initiating sexual encounter; they spoke words of love and winning talk that affected the minds (&quot;nous&quot;) and hearts of mortals and gods alike.

Himeros is closely associated with Pothos, the personification of passionate longing. In his dialogue &quot;Cratylus&quot;, Plato points out the difference between the two concepts explaining that, in the case of Himeros, the object of desire is present and thus the desire is ready to be satisfied; whereas, in the case of Pothos, the individual longs for something that is absent or out of reach. Subsequently, Pothos is unfulfilled and potentially a suffering. Though Himeros is the standard term for erotic desire, it can also appear in different contexts carrying an alternative meaning, like desire for grieve (after a tragic event) or for food; e.g. the &quot;&quot;himeros&quot; for sweet food&quot; that a laborer feels after a long day at work. Though these figures inspired artistic and poetic creations, they had no mythological stories or cults of their own.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hippocrene () is a spring on Mount Helicon. It was sacred to the Muses and was said to have formed when the winged horse Pegasus struck his hoof into the ground, whence its name which literally translates as &quot;Steed/Horse&#x27;s Fountain&quot;. The water was supposed to bring forth poetic inspiration when imbibed.

==Sources==
Hesiod refers to the horse&#x27;s well on Helicon in his &quot;Theogony&quot;.
And after they have washed their tender skin in Permessus or Hippocrene or holy Olmeidus, they perform choral dances on highest Helicon, beautiful, lovely ones, and move nimbly with their feet.
Petrarch refers to the fountain of Helicon in his epic poem &quot;Africa&quot;:
Sisters who are my sweet care, 
If I sing to you of wonders, 
I pray that it be granted to me 
To drink again at the fountain of Helicon. 
Camoens cites the fountain as a great source of poetic inspiration in his epic Portuguese poem &quot;The Lusiads,&quot; 
as translated:
And you, my Tagian Nymphs, oh, since my rhyme 
With ardent genius new you now inspire, 
If I was wont, well pleased, in former time 
To celebrate your stream with humble lyre, 
Oh, grant me now a lofty note sublime, 
A grand and glowing line of poet&#x27;s fire, 
That of your waters Phoebus may ordain: 
They shall not envy those of Hippocrene. 
John Keats refers to Hippocrene in his poem &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;.
O for a beaker full of the warm South
Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
And purple-stained mouth;
That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow mentions the fountain in his poem &quot;Goblet of Life&quot;:
No purple flowers,—no garlands green, 
Conceal the goblet&#x27;s shade or sheen, 
Nor maddening draughts of Hippocrene, 
Like gleams of sunshine, flash between 
Thick leaves of mistletoe.

<doc id="82489" wikidata="Q190436" url="?curid=82489" title="Epaminondas">
<text>Epaminondas (; ; 419/411–362 BC) was a Greek general and statesman of the 4th century BC who transformed the Ancient Greek city-state of Thebes, leading it out of Spartan subjugation into a pre-eminent position in Greek politics called the Theban Hegemony. In the process, he broke Spartan military power with his victory at Leuctra and liberated the Messenian helots, a group of Peloponnesian Greeks who had been enslaved under Spartan rule for some 230 years following their defeat in the Third Messenian War ending in 600 BC. Epaminondas reshaped the political map of Greece, fragmented old alliances, created new ones, and supervised the construction of entire cities. He was also militarily influential and invented and implemented several important battlefield tactics.

Xenophon, the historian and contemporary, is the main source for Epaminondas&#x27;s military prowess, and Xenophon describes his admiration for him in his major work &quot;Hellenica&quot; (book VII, chap. 5, 19). Accordingly, in later centuries the Roman orator Cicero called him &quot;the first man of Greece&quot;, and in more recent times Michel de Montaigne judged him one of the three &quot;worthiest and most excellent men&quot; who had ever lived. The changes Epaminondas wrought on the Greek political order did not long outlive him, as the cycle of shifting hegemonies and alliances continued unabated. A mere twenty-seven years after his death, a recalcitrant Thebes was obliterated by Alexander the Great. Thus Epaminondas—who had been praised in his time as an idealist and liberator—is today largely remembered for a decade (371 BC to 362 BC) of campaigning that sapped the strength of the great city-states and paved the way for Macedonian hegemony.

==Historical sources==
The life of Epaminondas is very poorly attested in the ancient sources, especially compared to some of his near contemporaries (e.g. Philip II of Macedon and Pelopidas). One principal reason for this is the loss of Plutarch&#x27;s biography of him. Epaminondas was one of approximately 50 ancient figures given an extensive biography by Plutarch in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, in which he is paired with the Roman statesman Scipio Africanus; however, both of these parts of &quot;Lives&quot; are now lost. Plutarch wrote his biography over 400 years after Epaminondas&#x27;s death and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements.

Some episodes of Epaminondas&#x27;s life can be found in Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; of Pelopidas and Agesilaus II, who were contemporaries. There is also a surviving (and possibly abridged) biography of Epaminondas by the Roman author Cornelius Nepos from the first century BC which, in the absence of Plutarch&#x27;s, becomes a major source for Epaminondas&#x27;s life.

The period of Greek history from 411–362 BC is primarily attested by the historian, contemporary and direct witness Xenophon, his work being a continuation of Thucydides&#x27;s &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;. Xenophon, who was partial to Sparta and its king, Agesilaus, does not always mention Epaminondas himself and does not note his presence at the Battle of Leuctra. However, Xenophon tells us of Epaminondas&#x27;s last battle and death, which is told in the last and seventh book of the &quot;Hellenica&quot;.

Epaminondas&#x27;s role in the conflicts of the 4th century is also described, much later, by Diodorus Siculus, in his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot;. Diodorus was writing in the 1st century BC, and is also very much a secondary source, though useful for corroborating details found elsewhere.

==Early life==
Epaminondas was born at Thebes to a family of high standing which, according to tradition, claimed descent from the mythical Spartoi. His year of birth cannot be determined with precision, and estimates have varied between 419 and 411 BC. What has been recorded of Epaminondas&#x27;s immediate family is that his father was called Polymnis, he had a brother named Caphisias, and both parents lived to see his victory at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC. His education was regarded as excellent and comprehensive. He learned how to handle a cither, to play the flute, and to dance, and, while exercising in the gymnasium (traditionally a cornerstone of Theban education), he demonstrated a preference for agility over sheer strength. Epaminondas was taught philosophy by Lysis of Tarentum, a Pythagorean who had escaped persecution in Magna Graecia and allowed to settle in Epaminondas&#x27;s father&#x27;s own house.

Lysis had a significant influence on Epaminondas, who grew devoted to his aged teacher, embraced his Pythagorean philosophy, and later reportedly took special care of his grave. Epaminondas was said to have displayed all the desirable virtues of the age, including patriotism, incorruptibility, selflessness, and modesty. In order to limit his needs and increase his independence, he led a frugal lifestyle and even seems to have lived in voluntary poverty. The ancient sources also draw attention to his skill in military matters and eloquence, as well as his taciturn demeanor, steadfast wit, and aptitude for crude humor. Epaminondas never married, which he compensated, in Pythagorean manner, by assiduously cultivating friendships, most famously with his lifelong companion Pelopidas.

==Political and military career==
===Background===
Epaminondas lived at a particularly turbulent point in Greek history. Following its victory in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC, Sparta had embarked upon an aggressively unilateralist policy towards the rest of Greece and quickly alienated many of its former allies. Thebes, meanwhile, had greatly increased its own power during the war and sought to gain control of the other cities of Boeotia (the region of ancient Greece northwest of Attica). This policy, along with other disputes, brought Thebes into conflict with Sparta. By 395 BC, Thebes, alongside Athens, Corinth, and Argos, found itself arrayed against Sparta (a former ally) in the Corinthian War. That war, which dragged on inconclusively for eight years, saw several bloody Theban defeats at Spartan hands. By the time of its conclusion, Thebes had been forced to check its expansionist ambitions and return to its old alliance with Sparta.

In 382 BC, however, the Spartan commander Phoebidas committed an act that would ultimately turn Thebes against Sparta for good and pave the way for Epaminondas&#x27;s rise to power. Passing through Boeotia on campaign, Phoebidas took advantage of civil strife within Thebes to secure entrance to the city for his troops. Once inside, he seized the Cadmeia (the Theban acropolis), and forced the anti-Spartan party to flee the city. Epaminondas, although associated with that faction, was allowed to remain; since &quot;his philosophy made him to be looked down upon as a recluse, and his poverty as impotent&quot;. The Spartans installed a puppet government in Thebes, and garrisoned the Cadmeia to ensure the behaviour of the Thebans.

===Early career===

Epaminondas supposedly served in a Theban contingent that aided Sparta in its attack against the city of Mantinea in 385 BC, during which he is said to have saved the life of Pelopidas, an act that cemented their friendship. The anecdote, reported by Plutarch and Pausanias, has been dismissed as an unhistorical doublet of Socrates&#x27;s saving of Alcibiades at the Battle of Delium in 424 BC. While some historians at least accept that Epaminondas served with the Spartans in 385 BC, one author has questioned altogether the existence of a Spartan–Theban alliance during this period.

====Theban coup of 378 BC====
In the years following the Spartan takeover, the exiled Thebans regrouped in Athens and, at the instigation of Pelopidas, prepared to liberate their city. Meanwhile, in Thebes, Epaminondas began preparing the young men of the city to fight the Spartans. In the winter of 379 BC, a small group of the exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrated the city. They then assassinated the leaders of the pro-Spartan government, and supported by Epaminondas and Gorgidas, who led a group of young men, and a force of Athenian hoplites, they surrounded the Spartans on the Cadmeia. The following day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought Pelopidas and his men before the Theban assembly and exhorted the Thebans to fight for their freedom; the assembly responded by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators. The Cadmeia was surrounded, and the Spartans attacked; Pelopidas realised that they must be expelled before an army came from Sparta to relieve them. The Spartan garrison eventually surrendered on the condition that they were allowed to march away unharmed. The narrow margin of the conspirators&#x27; success is demonstrated by the fact that the Spartan garrison met a Spartan force on the way to rescue them as they marched back to Sparta.

====Aftermath, 378–371 BC====
When news of the uprising at Thebes reached Sparta, an army under Cleombrotus I had been dispatched to subdue the city, but turned back without engaging the Thebans. Another army under Agesilaus II was then dispatched to attack the Thebans. However, the Thebans refused to meet the Spartan army in battle, instead building a trench and stockade outside Thebes, which they occupied, preventing the Spartans advancing on the city. The Spartans ravaged the countryside but eventually departed, leaving Thebes independent. This victory so heartened the Thebans that they undertook operations against other neighboring cities as well. In short order the Thebans were able to reconstitute their old Boeotian confederacy in a new, democratic form. The cities of Boeotia united as a federation with an executive body composed of seven generals, or Boeotarchs, elected from seven districts throughout Boeotia. This political fusion was so successful that henceforth the names &quot;Theban&quot; and &quot;Boeotian&quot; were used interchangeably in a nod to the newfound solidarity of the region.

Seeking to crush the Thebans, the Spartans would invade Boeotia three times over the next few years (378 BC, 377 BC, ? possibly Leuctra). At first, the Thebans feared facing the Spartans head on, but the conflict gave them much practice and training, and they &quot;had their spirits roused and their bodies thoroughly inured to hardships, and gained experience and courage from their constant struggles&quot;. Although Sparta remained the dominant land power in Greece, the Boeotians had demonstrated that they, too, were a martial threat and a politically cohesive power. At the same time, Pelopidas, an advocate of an aggressive policy against Sparta, had established himself as a major political leader in Thebes.

Epaminondas&#x27;s role in the years prior to 371 BC is difficult to piece together. Certainly, he served with the Theban armies in the defence of Boeotia in the 370s BC, and by 371 BC, he had become a Boeotarch. It seems safe to assume, given their close friendship and their close collaboration after 371 BC, that Epaminondas and Pelopidas also collaborated closely on Theban policy in the period of 378–371 BC.

====Peace conference of 371 BC====
The years following the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict. A feeble attempt at a common peace had been made in 375 BC, but desultory fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373 BC (at the latest). By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.

Epaminondas was serving as a Boeotarch for 371 BC, and led the Boeotian delegation to the peace conference. Peace terms were agreed at the outset of the conference, and the Thebans presumably signed the treaty in their own name alone. However, on the following day, Epaminondas caused a drastic break with Sparta when he insisted on signing not for the Thebans alone, but for all the Boeotians. Agesilaus refused to allow the change of the Theban envoys&#x27; signature, insisting that the cities of Boeotia should be independent; Epaminondas countered that if this were to be the case, the cities of Laconia should be as well. Irate, Agesilaus struck the Thebans from the document. The delegation returned to Thebes, and both sides mobilized for war.

====Battle of Leuctra (371 BC)====
Immediately following the failure of the peace talks, orders were sent out from Sparta to the Spartan king Cleombrotus, who was at the head of an army in Phocis, commanding him to march directly to Boeotia. Skirting north to avoid mountain passes where the Boeotians were prepared to ambush him, Cleombrotus entered Boeotian territory from an unexpected direction and quickly seized a fort and captured 10 or 12 triremes. Then marching towards Thebes, he camped at Leuctra, in the territory of Thespiae. Here, the Boeotian army came to meet him. The Spartan army contained some 10,000 hoplites, 700 of whom were the elite warriors known as Spartiates. The Boeotians opposite them numbered about 6,000, but were bolstered by a cavalry superior to that of the Peloponnesians.

Epaminondas was given charge of the Boeotian army, with the other six Boeotarchs in an advisory capacity. Pelopidas, meanwhile, was captain of the Sacred Band, the elite Theban troops. Before the battle, there was evidently much debate amongst the Boeotarchs about whether to fight or not. As a consistent advocate of an aggressive policy, Epaminondas wished to fight, and supported by Pelopidas, he managed to swing the vote in favour of battle. During the course of the battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek warfare.

The phalanx formation used by Greek armies had a distinct tendency to veer to the right during battle, &quot;because fear makes each man do his best to shelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the right&quot;. Traditionally, a phalanx therefore lined up for battle with the elite troops on the right flank to counter this tendency. Thus, in the Spartan phalanx at Leuctra, Cleombrotus and the elite &#x27;Spartiates&#x27; were on the right, while the less experienced Peloponnesian allies were on the left. However, needing to counter the Spartans&#x27; numerical advantage, Epaminondas implemented two tactical innovations. Firstly, he took the best troops in the army, and arranged them 50 ranks deep (as opposed to the normal 8–12 ranks) on the &quot;left&quot; wing, opposite Cleombrotus and the Spartans, with Pelopidas and the Sacred Band on the extreme left flank. Secondly, recognizing that he could not have matched the width of the Peloponnesian phalanx (even before deepening the left flank), he abandoned all attempts to do so. Instead, placing the weaker troops on the right flank, he &quot;instructed them to avoid battle and withdraw gradually during the enemy&#x27;s attack&quot;. The tactic of the deep phalanx had been anticipated by Pagondas, another Theban general, who used a 25 man deep formation at the Battle of Delium. However, the reversing of the position of the elite troops, and an oblique line of attack were innovations; it seems that Epaminondas was therefore responsible for the military tactic of refusing one&#x27;s flank.

The fighting at Leuctra opened with a clash between the cavalry, in which the Thebans were victorious over the inferior Spartan cavalry, driving them back into the ranks of the infantry, and thereby disrupting the phalanx. The battle then commenced in earnest, with the strengthened Theban left flank advancing at double speed, while the right flank retreated. After intense fighting, the Spartan right flank began to give way under the impetus and the mass of Thebans, and Cleombrotus was killed. Although the Spartans held on for long enough to rescue the body of the king, their line was soon broken by the sheer force of the Theban assault. The Peloponnesian allies on the left wing, seeing the Spartans put to flight, also broke and ran, and the entire army retreated in disarray. One thousand Peloponnesians were killed, while the Boeotians lost only 300 men. Most importantly, since it constituted a significant proportion of the entire Spartan manpower, 400 of the 700 Spartiates present were killed, a loss that posed a serious threat to Sparta&#x27;s future war-making abilities. When, after the battle, the Spartans asked if they and the Peloponnesians could collect the dead, Epaminondas suspected that the Spartans would try to cover-up the scale of their losses. He therefore allowed the Peloponnesians to remove their dead first, so that those remaining would be shown to be Spartiates, and emphasise the scale of the Theban victory.

The victory at Leuctra shook the foundations of the Spartan dominance of Greece to the core. Since the number of Spartiates was always relatively small, Sparta had relied on her allies in order to field substantial armies. However, with the defeat at Leuctra, the Peloponnesian allies were less inclined to bow to Spartan demands. Furthermore, with the loss of men at Leuctra and other battles, the Spartans were not in a strong position to reassert their dominance over their erstwhile allies.

===Theban hegemony===

In the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans considered following up their victory by taking their vengeance on Sparta; they also invited Athens to join them in doing so. However, their Thessalian allies under Jason of Pherae dissuaded them from shattering what remained of the Spartan army. Instead, Epaminondas occupied himself with consolidating the Boeotian confederacy, compelling the previously Spartan-aligned polis of Orchomenus to join the league.

The following year the Thebans invaded the Peloponnesus, aiming to break Spartan power for good. It is not clear exactly when the Thebans started to think not just of ending the Spartan hegemony, but of replacing it with one of their own, but it is clear that eventually this became their aim. Hans Beck asserts that, unlike Sparta in the Peloponnesian League and Athens in the Delian League, Thebes made no effort either to create an empire or to bind its allies in any sort of permanent and stable organization. Indeed, after Leuctra Thebes devoted its attention to diplomatic efforts in Central Greece rather than schemes of domination further afield. By late 370 Thebes&#x27; network of alliances in central Greece made her secure in the area—as she had not been before Leuctra—and offered scope for further expansion of Theban influence.

====First Invasion of the Peloponnese (370 BC)====
When, in the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans had sent a herald to Athens with news of their victory, the messenger was met with stony silence. The Athenians then decided to take advantage of the Spartan discomfiture, holding a conference in Athens, in which the peace terms proposed earlier in 371 BC were ratified by all cities (except Elis); and this time, the treaty explicitly made the Peloponnesian cities, formerly under Spartan dominance, independent. Taking advantage of this, the Mantineans decided to unify their settlements into a single city, and to fortify it; a decision which greatly angered Agesilaus. Furthermore, Tegea, supported by Mantinea, instigated the formation of an Arcadian alliance. This led to the Spartans declaring war on Mantinea, whereupon the majority of Arcadian cities grouped together to oppose the Spartans (thus forming the confederation that the Spartans were trying to prevent), and requested assistance from the Thebans. The Theban force arrived late in 370 BC, and it was led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, both at this time Boeotarchs. As they journeyed into Arcadia, the Thebans were joined by armed contingents from many of Sparta&#x27;s former allies, swelling their forces to some 50–70,000 men. In Arcadia Epaminondas encouraged the Arcadians to form their proposed league, and to build the new city of Megalopolis (as a center of power opposed to Sparta).
Epaminondas, supported by Pelopidas and the Arcadians, then persuaded the other Boeotarchs to invade Laconia. Moving south, they crossed the Evrotas River, the frontier of Sparta, which no hostile army had breached in memory. The Spartans, unwilling to engage the massive army in battle, simply defended their city, which the Thebans did not attempt to capture. The Thebans and their allies ravaged Laconia, down to the port of Gythium, freeing some of the Lacedaemonian perioeci from their allegiance to Sparta. Epaminondas briefly returned to Arcadia, before marching south again, this time to Messenia, a region which the Spartans had conquered some 200 years before. Epaminondas freed the helots of Messenia, and rebuilt the ancient city of Messene on Mount Ithome, with fortifications that were among the strongest in Greece. He then issued a call to Messenian exiles all over Greece to return and rebuild their homeland. The loss of Messenia was particularly damaging to the Spartans, since the territory comprised one-third of Sparta&#x27;s territory and contained half of their helot population. It had been the helots&#x27; labor which had allowed the Spartans to become a &quot;full-time&quot; army.

Epaminondas&#x27; campaign of 370/369 BC has been described as an example of &quot;the grand strategy of indirect approach&quot;, which was aimed at severing &quot;the economic roots of her [Sparta&#x27;s] military supremacy.&quot; In mere months, Epaminondas had created two new enemy states that opposed Sparta, shaken the foundations of Sparta&#x27;s economy, and all but devastated Sparta&#x27;s prestige. This accomplished, he led his army back home, victorious.

====Trial====
In order to accomplish all that he wished in the Peloponnesus, Epaminondas had persuaded his fellow Boeotarchs to remain in the field for several months after their term of office had expired. Upon his return home, Epaminondas was therefore greeted not with a hero&#x27;s welcome but with a trial arranged by his political enemies. According to Cornelius Nepos, in his defense Epaminondas merely requested that, if he be executed, the inscription regarding the verdict read: Epaminondas was punished by the Thebans with death, because he obliged them to overthrow the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra, whom, before he was general, none of the Boeotians durst look upon in the field, and because he not only, by one battle, rescued Thebes from destruction, but also secured liberty for all Greece, and brought the power of both people to such a condition, that the Thebans attacked Sparta, and the Lacedaemonians were content if they could save their lives; nor did he cease to prosecute the war, till, after settling Messene, he shut up Sparta with a close siege. The jury broke into laughter, the charges were dropped, and Epaminondas was re-elected as Boeotarch for the next year.

====Second invasion of the Peloponnesus (369 BC)====
In 369 BC the Argives, Eleans and the Arcadians, eager to continue their war against Sparta, recalled the Thebans to their support. Epaminondas, at the height of his prestige, again commanded an allied invasion force. Arriving at the Isthmus of Corinth, the Thebans found it heavily guarded by the Spartans and Athenians (along with the Corinthians, Megarans and Pellenians). Epaminondas decided to attack the weakest spot, guarded by the Lacedaemonians; in a dawn attack he forced his way through the Spartan position, and joined his Peloponnesian allies. The Thebans thus won an easy victory and crossed the Isthmus. Diodorus stresses that this was &quot;a feat no whit inferior to his former mighty deeds&quot;.

However, the rest of the expedition achieved little: Sicyon and Pellene became allied to Thebes, and the countryside of Troezen and Epidaurus was ravaged, but the cities could not be taken. After an abortive attack on Corinth and the arrival of a task force sent by Dionysius of Syracuse to aid Sparta, the Thebans decided to march home.

====Thessaly (368 BC)====
When Epaminondas returned to Thebes, he continued to be dogged by his political enemies who prosecuted him for the second time. They actually succeeded in excluding him from the office of Boeotarch for the year 368 BC. This was the only time from the Battle of Leuctra until his death that he did not serve as Boeotarch. In 368, the Theban army marched into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas and Ismenias, who had been imprisoned by Alexander of Pherae while serving as ambassadors. The Theban force not only failed to overcome Alexander and his allies, but got into serious difficulties, when it tried to withdraw; Epaminondas, serving as a private soldier, succeeded in extricating it. In early 367, Epaminondas led a second Theban expedition to free Pelopidas, and Ismenias. He finally outmanoeuvred the Thessalians, and secured the release of the two Theban ambassadors without a fight.

====Third invasion of the Peloponnesus (367 BC)====
In the spring of 367 BC, Epaminondas again invaded the Peloponnesus. This time an Argive army captured part of the Isthmus on Epaminondas&#x27;s request, allowing the Theban army to enter the Peloponnesus unhindered. On this occasion, Epaminondas marched to Achaea, seeking to secure their allegiance to Thebes. No army dared to challenge him in the field, and the Achaean oligarchies therefore acquiesced to the request that they be allied to Thebes. Epaminondas&#x27; acceptance of the Achaean oligarchies roused protests by both the Arcadians and his political rivals, and his settlement was thus shortly reversed: democracies were set up, and the oligarchs exiled. These democratic governments were short-lived, since the pro-Spartan aristocrats from all the cities banded together and attacked each city in turn, re-establishing the oligarchies. According to G.L. Cawkwell, &quot;the sequel perhaps showed the good sense of Epaminondas. When these exiles recovered the cities, they &#x27;no longer took a middle course&#x27;.&quot; In the light of their treatment by Thebes, they abandoned their previously neutral stance, and thereafter &quot;fought zealously in support of the Lacedaemonians&quot;.

====Resistance to Thebes====

In 366/365 BC an attempt was made to make a common peace, with the Persian King Artaxerxes II as arbiter and guarantor. Thebes organized a conference to have the terms of the peace accepted, but their diplomatic initiative failed: the negotiations could not resolve the hostility between Thebes and other states that resented its influence (such as the Arcadian leader Lycomedes who challenged the right of the Thebans to hold the congress in Thebes); the peace was never fully accepted, and fighting soon resumed. believes that Thebes had concrete gains from the congress: &quot;The peace of 366/5 set the seal on Epaminondas&#x27; Peloponnesian policy. Under it the remaining members of the Peloponnesian league finally abandoned Sparta, and recognized the independence of Messenia and, presumably, the unification of Boeotia.&quot;

Throughout the decade after the Battle of Leuctra, numerous former allies of Thebes defected to the Spartan alliance or even to alliances with other hostile states. By the middle of the next decade, even some Arcadians (whose league Epaminondas had helped establish in 369 BC) had turned against them. At the same time, however, Epaminondas managed through a series of diplomatic efforts to dismantle the Peloponnesian league: the remaining members of the league finally abandoned Sparta (in 365 Corinth, Epidaurus, and Phlius made peace with Thebes and Argos), and Messenia remained independent and firmly loyal to Thebes.

Boeotian armies campaigned across Greece as opponents rose up on all sides; Epaminondas even led his state in a challenge to Athens at sea. The Theban demos voted him a fleet of a hundred triremes to win over Rhodes, Chios, and Byzantium. The fleet finally sailed in 364, but modern scholars believe that Epaminondas achieved no lasting gains for Thebes on this voyage. In that same year, Pelopidas was killed while campaigning against Alexander of Pherae in Thessaly. His loss deprived Epaminondas of his greatest Theban political ally.

====Fourth invasion of the Peloponnesus (362 BC)====

In the face of this increasing opposition to Theban dominance, Epaminondas launched his final expedition into the Peloponnese in 362 BC. The immediate goal of the expedition was to subdue Mantinea, which had been opposing Theban influence in the region. Epaminondas brought an army drawn from Boeotia, Thessaly and Euboea. He was joined by Tegea, which was the center of local opposition to Mantinea, Argos, Messenia, and some of the Arcadians. Mantinea, on the other hand, had requested assistance from Sparta, Athens, Achaea and the rest of Arcadia, so that almost all of Greece was represented on one side or the other.

This time the mere presence of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided that he would have to break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended. Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well. Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.

What followed on the plain in front of Mantinea was the largest hoplite battle in Greek history. Epaminondas had the larger army, 30,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, whilst his opponents numbered 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry.Xenophon says that, having decided to fight, Epaminondas arranged the army into battle order, and then marched it in a column &quot;parallel&quot; to the Mantinean lines, so that it appeared that the army was marching elsewhere, and would not fight that day. Having reached a certain point in the march, he then had the army down arms, so it appeared they were getting ready to camp. Xenophon suggests that &quot;by so doing he caused among most of the enemy a relaxation of their mental readiness for fighting, and likewise a relaxation of their readiness as regards their array for battle&quot;. The whole column, which had been marching right-to-left past the front of the Mantinean army then &#x27;right-faced&#x27;, so that they were now in a battle line, facing the Mantineans. Epaminondas, who had been at the head of the column (now the left wing), brought some companies of infantry from the extreme right wing, behind the battle line, to reinforce the left wing. By this, he recreated the strengthened left-wing that Thebes had fielded at Leuctra (this time probably made up by all the Boeotians, and not just the Thebans as at Leuctra). On the wings he placed strong forces of cavalry strengthened by light-infantry.

Epaminondas then gave the order to advance, catching the enemy off guard, and causing a furious scramble in the Mantinean camp to prepare for battle. The battle unfolded as Epaminondas had planned. The cavalry forces on the wings drove back the Athenian and Mantinean cavalry opposite them. Diodorus says that the Athenian cavalry on the Mantinean right wing, although not inferior in quality, could not withstand the missiles from the light-troops that Epaminondas had placed among the Theban cavalry. Meanwhile, the Theban infantry advanced. Xenophon evocatively describes Epaminondas&#x27;s thinking: &quot;[he] led forward his army prow on, like a trireme, believing that if he could strike and cut through anywhere, he would destroy the entire army of his adversaries. As at Leuctra, the weakened right wing was ordered to hold back and avoid fighting. In the clash of infantry, the issue briefly hung in the balance, but then the Theban left-wing broke through the Spartan line, and the entire enemy phalanx was put to flight. However, at the height of the battle, Epaminondas was mortally wounded by a Spartan, and died shortly thereafter. Following his death, the Thebes and allies made no effort to pursue the fleeing enemy; a testament to Epaminondas&#x27;s centrality to the war effort.

==Death==

While pressing forward with the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas was hit in the chest by a spear (or, in some accounts, a sword or large knife). Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans. The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as Anticrates, Machaerion, or Gryllus, son of Xenophon.

The spear broke, leaving the iron point in his body, and Epaminondas collapsed. The Thebans around him fought desperately to stop the Spartans taking possession of his body. When he was carried back to camp still living, he asked which side was victorious. When he was told that the Boeotians had won, he said &quot;It is time to die.&quot; Diodorus suggests that one of his friends exclaimed &quot;You die childless, Epaminondas&quot; and then burst into tears. In response, Epaminondas is supposed to have replied &quot;No, by Zeus, on the contrary I leave behind two daughters, Leuctra and Mantinea, my victories.&quot; Cornelius Nepos, whose story is otherwise similar has the last words of Epaminondas as &quot;I have lived long enough; for I die unconquered.&quot; When the spear point was withdrawn, Epaminondas quickly died. In accordance with Greek custom, he was buried on the battlefield.

==Assessments==

===Character===
In matters of character, Epaminondas was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians who recorded his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.

Epaminondas never married and as such was subject to criticism from countrymen who believed he was duty-bound to provide the country with the benefit of sons as great as himself. In response, Epaminondas said that his victory at Leuctra was a daughter destined to live forever. He is known, however, to have had several young male lovers, a standard pedagogic practice in ancient Greece, and one that Thebes in particular was famous for; Plutarch records that the Theban lawgivers instituted the practice &quot;to temper the manners and characters of the youth&quot;. An anecdote told by Cornelius Nepos indicates that Epaminondas was intimate with a young man by the name of Micythus. Plutarch also mentions two of his beloveds (&quot;eromenoi&quot;): Asopichus, who fought together with him at the battle of Leuctra, where he greatly distinguished himself; and Caphisodorus, who fell with Epaminondas at Mantineia and was buried by his side.

In &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, he is described as one of the six most virtuous and noble men who have lived.

===Military record===
Extant biographies of Epaminondas universally describe him as one of the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: &quot;Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone.&quot; Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas&#x27;s military record:
For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior.

As a tactician, Epaminondas stands above every other general in Greek history, except kings Philip II and Alexander the Great, although modern historians have questioned his larger strategic vision. According to Richard A. Gabriel, his tactics &quot;marked the beginning of the end of traditional Greek methods of war&quot;. His innovative strategy at Leuctra allowed him to defeat the vaunted Spartan phalanx with a smaller force, and his decision to refuse his right flank was the first recorded instance of such a tactic. Many of the tactical innovations that Epaminondas implemented would also be used by Philip II, who in his youth spent time as a hostage in Thebes and may have learned directly from Epaminondas himself.

===Legacy===
In some ways Epaminondas dramatically altered the face of Greece during the 10 years in which he was the central figure of Greek politics. By the time of his death, Sparta had been humbled, Messenia freed, and the Peloponnese completely reorganized. In another respect, however, he left behind a Greece no different from that which he had found; the bitter divides and animosities that had poisoned international relations in Greece for over a century remained as deep as or deeper than they had been before Leuctra. The brutal internecine warfare that had characterized the years from 432 BC onwards continued unabated until all the states involved were defeated by Macedon.

At Mantinea, Thebes had faced down the combined forces of the greatest states of Greece, but the victory brought it no spoils. With Epaminondas removed from the scene, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, and within a few years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system. No Greek state ever again reduced Boeotia to the subjection it had known during the Spartan hegemony, but Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. Finally, at Chaeronea in 338 BC, the combined forces of Thebes and Athens, driven into each other&#x27;s arms for a desperate last stand against Philip of Macedon, were crushingly defeated, and Theban independence was put to an end. Three years later, heartened by a false rumor that Alexander had been assassinated, the Thebans revolted; Alexander squashed the revolt, then destroyed the city, slaughtering or enslaving all its citizens. A mere 27 years after the death of the man who had made it preeminent throughout Greece, Thebes was wiped from the face of the Earth, its 1,000-year history ended in the space of a few days.

Epaminondas, therefore, is remembered both as a liberator and a destroyer. He was celebrated throughout the ancient Greek and Roman worlds as one of the greatest men of history. Cicero eulogized him as &quot;the first man, in my judgement, of Greece,&quot; and Pausanias records an honorary poem from his tomb:

Epaminondas&#x27;s actions were certainly welcomed by the Messenians and others whom he assisted in his campaigns against the Spartans. Those same Spartans, however, had been at the center of resistance to the Persian invasions of the 5th century BC, and their absence was sorely felt at Chaeronea; the endless warfare in which Epaminondas played a central role weakened the cities of Greece until they could no longer hold their own against their neighbors to the north. As Epaminondas campaigned to secure freedom for the Boeotians and others throughout Greece, he brought closer the day when all of Greece would be subjugated by an invader. Victor Davis Hanson has suggested that Epaminondas may have planned for a united Greece composed of regional democratic federations, but even if this assertion is correct, no such plan was ever implemented. Simon Hornblower asserts that Thebes&#x27; great legacy to fourth century and Hellenistic Greece was federalism, &quot;a kind of alternative to imperialism, a way of achieving unity without force&quot;, which &quot;embodies a representative principle&quot;.

For all his noble qualities, Epaminondas was unable to transcend the Greek city-state system, with its endemic rivalry and warfare, and thus left Greece more war-ravaged but no less divided than he found it. Hornblower asserts that &quot;it is a sign of Epaminondas&#x27; political failure, even before the battle of Mantinea, that his Peloponnesian allies fought to reject Sparta rather than because of the positive attractions of Thebes&quot;. On the other hand, Cawkwell concludes that &quot;Epaminondas must be judged not in relation to these inevitable limitations of Boeotian power. To have established the power of Boeotia and ended the Spartan domination of the Peloponnese was the most and the best that a Boeotian could have done.&quot;

<text>The Hyades (; Greek Ὑάδες, also known as Caldwell 41, Collinder 50, or Melotte 25) is the nearest open cluster and one of the best-studied star clusters. Located about away from the Sun, it consists of a roughly spherical group of hundreds of stars sharing the same age, place of origin, chemical characteristics, and motion through space. From the perspective of observers on Earth, the Hyades Cluster appears in the constellation Taurus, where its brightest stars form a &quot;V&quot; shape along with the still-brighter Aldebaran. However, Aldebaran is unrelated to the Hyades, as it is located much closer to Earth (65 ly) and merely happens to lie along the same line of sight.

The five brightest member stars of the Hyades have consumed the hydrogen fuel at their cores and are now evolving into giant stars. Four of these stars, with Bayer designations Gamma, Delta 1, Epsilon, and Theta Tauri, form an asterism that is traditionally identified as the head of Taurus the Bull. The fifth of these stars is Theta1 Tauri, a tight naked-eye companion to the brighter Theta2 Tauri. Epsilon Tauri, known as &quot;Ain&quot; (the &quot;Bull&#x27;s Eye&quot;), has a gas giant exoplanet candidate, the first planet to be found in any open cluster.

The age of the Hyades is estimated to be about 625 million years. The core of the cluster, where stars are the most densely packed, has a radius of , and the cluster&#x27;s tidal radius – where the stars become more strongly influenced by the gravity of the surrounding Milky Way galaxy – is . However, about one-third of confirmed member stars have been observed well outside the latter boundary, in the cluster&#x27;s extended halo; these stars are probably in the process of escaping from its gravitational influence.

== Location and motion ==
The cluster is sufficiently close to the Sun that its distance can be directly measured by observing the amount of parallax shift of the member stars as the Earth orbits the Sun. This measurement has been performed with great accuracy using the Hipparcos satellite and the Hubble Space Telescope. An alternative method of computing the distance is to fit the cluster members to a standardized infrared color–magnitude diagram for stars of their type, and use the resulting data to infer their intrinsic brightness. Comparing this data to the brightness of the stars as seen from Earth allows their distances to be estimated. Both methods have yielded a distance estimate of to the cluster center. The fact that these independent measurements agree makes the Hyades an important rung on the cosmic distance ladder method for estimating the distances of extragalactic objects.

The stars of the Hyades are more enriched in heavier elements than the Sun and other ordinary stars in the solar neighborhood, with the overall cluster metallicity measured at +0.14. The Hyades Cluster is related to other stellar groups in the Sun&#x27;s vicinity. Its age, metallicity, and proper motion coincide with those of the larger and more distant Praesepe Cluster, and the trajectories of both clusters can be traced back to the same region of space, indicating a common origin. Another associate is the Hyades Stream, a large collection of scattered stars that also share a similar trajectory with the Hyades Cluster. Recent results have found that at least 15% of stars in the Hyades Stream share the same chemical fingerprint as the Hyades cluster stars. However, about 85% of stars in the Hyades Stream have been shown to be completely unrelated to the original cluster on the grounds of dissimilar age and metallicity; their common motion is attributed to tidal effects of the massive rotating bar at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Among the remaining members of the Hyades Stream, the exoplanet host star Iota Horologii has recently been proposed as an escaped member of the primordial Hyades Cluster.

The Hyades are unrelated to two other nearby stellar groups, the Pleiades and the Ursa Major Stream, which are easily visible to the naked eye under clear dark skies.

== Astrometry ==
A 2018 Gaia DR1 study of the Hyades Cluster determined a (U, V, W) group velocity of (−41.92 ± 0.16, −19.35 ± 0.13, −1.11 ± 0.11) km/sec, based on the space velocities of the 138 core stars. 

A 2019 Gaia DR2 study finds a (U, V, W) group velocity of (−42.24, −19.00, −1.48) km/sec, in very close agreement with the 2018 DR1 derivation. 

Another DR2 study from 2019 focused on mapping the 3D Topology &amp; Velocities of the Hyades main body out to 30 parsecs, and included Sub-Stellar members as well. They identified 1764 member candidates, including 10 Brown Dwarfs and 17 White Dwarfs. The White Dwarfs included 9 single stars, and 4 binary systems. 

A 2022 Hyades study utilizing Gaia EDR3 derived a (U, V, W) group velocity of (-42.11±6.50, - 19.09±4.37, -1.32±0.44) km/sec, also with close agreement to DR1 and DR2 studies. 

== History ==
Together with the other eye-catching open star cluster of the Pleiades, the Hyades form the Golden Gate of the Ecliptic, which has been known for several thousand years.

In Greek mythology, the Hyades were the five daughters of Atlas and half-sisters to the Pleiades. After the death of their brother, Hyas, the weeping sisters were transformed into a cluster of stars that was afterwards associated with rain.

As a naked-eye object, the Hyades cluster has been known since prehistoric times. It is mentioned by numerous Classical authors from Homer to Ovid. In Book 18 of the &quot;Iliad&quot; the stars of the Hyades appear along with the Pleiades, Ursa Major, and Orion on the shield that the god Hephaistos made for Achilles.

In England the cluster was known as the &quot;April Rainers&quot; from an association with April showers, as recorded in the folk song &quot;Green Grow the Rushes, O&quot;.

The cluster was probably first catalogued by Giovanni Battista Hodierna in 1654, and it subsequently appeared in many star atlases of the 17th and 18th centuries. However, Charles Messier did not include the Hyades in his 1781 catalog of deep sky objects. It therefore lacks a Messier number, unlike many other, more distant open clusters – e.g., M44 (Praesepe), M45 (Pleiades), and M67.

In 1869, the astronomer R.A. Proctor observed that numerous stars at large distances from the Hyades share a similar motion through space. In 1908, Lewis Boss reported almost 25 years of observations to support this premise, arguing for the existence of a co-moving group of stars that he called the Taurus Stream (now generally known as the Hyades Stream or Hyades Supercluster). Boss published a chart that traced the scattered stars&#x27; movements back to a common point of convergence.

By the 1920s, the notion that the Hyades shared a common origin with the Praesepe Cluster was widespread, with Rudolf Klein-Wassink noting in 1927 that the two clusters are &quot;probably cosmically related&quot;. For much of the twentieth century, scientific study of the Hyades focused on determining its distance, modeling its evolution, confirming or rejecting candidate members, and characterizing individual stars.

== Morphology and evolution ==
All stars form in clusters, but most clusters break up less than 50 million years after star formation concludes. The astronomical term for this process is &quot;evaporation.&quot; Only extremely massive clusters, orbiting far from the Galactic Center, can avoid evaporation over extended timescales. As one such survivor, the Hyades Cluster probably contained a much larger star population in its infancy. Estimates of its original mass range from 800 to 1,600 times the mass of the Sun (), implying still larger numbers of individual stars.

===Star populations===
Theory predicts that a young cluster of this size should give birth to stars and substellar objects of all spectral types, from huge, hot O stars down to dim brown dwarfs. However, studies of the Hyades show that it is deficient in stars at both extremes of mass. At an age of 625 million years, the cluster&#x27;s main sequence turn-off is about , meaning that all heavier stars have evolved into subgiants, giants, or white dwarfs, while less massive stars continue fusing hydrogen on the main sequence. Extensive surveys have revealed a total of 8 white dwarfs in the cluster core, corresponding to the final evolutionary stage of its original population of B-type stars (each about ). The preceding evolutionary stage is currently represented by the cluster&#x27;s four red clump giants. Their present spectral type is K0 III, but all are actually &quot;retired A stars&quot; of around . An additional &quot;white giant&quot; of type A7 III is the primary of θ2 Tauri, a binary system that includes a less massive companion of spectral type A; this pair is visually associated with θ1 Tauri, one of the four red giants, which also has an A-type binary companion.

The remaining population of confirmed cluster members includes numerous bright stars of spectral types A (at least 21), F (about 60), and G (about 50). All these star types are concentrated much more densely within the tidal radius of the Hyades than within an equivalent 10-parsec radius of the Earth. By comparison, our local 10-parsec sphere contains only 4 A stars, 6 F stars, and 21 G stars.

The Hyades&#x27; cohort of lower-mass stars – spectral types K and M – remains poorly understood, despite proximity and long observation. At least 48 K dwarfs are confirmed members, along with about a dozen M dwarfs of spectral types M0-M2. Additional M dwarfs have been proposed in the past. This deficiency at the bottom of the mass range contrasts strongly with the distribution of stars within 10 parsecs of the Solar System, where at least 239 M dwarfs are known, comprising about 76% of all neighborhood stars. In more recent studies more low-mass members were discovered. This is due targeted searches and an improvement in proper motion searches. About 35 L-type (7+1+8+6+3+4+3+3) and 15 T-type (2+1+3+1+4+4) brown dwarfs are currently reported as Hyades members or candidate members. Meanwhile Gaia DR2 allowed the identification of 710 cluster members within 30 parsec, including 23 candidates with estimated masses between 60 and 80 .

===Mass segregation===

The observed distribution of stellar types in the Hyades Cluster demonstrates a history of mass segregation. With the exception of its white dwarfs, the cluster&#x27;s central contain only star systems of at least . This tight concentration of heavy stars gives the Hyades its overall structure, with a core defined by bright, closely packed systems and a halo consisting of more widely separated stars in which later spectral types are common. The core radius is 2.7 parsecs (8.8 light-years, a little more than the distance between the Sun and Sirius), while the half-mass radius, within which half the cluster&#x27;s mass is contained, is . The tidal radius of represents the Hyades&#x27; average outer limit, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core.

Stellar evaporation occurs in the cluster halo as smaller stars are scattered outward by more massive insiders. From the halo they may then be lost to tides exerted by the Galactic core or to shocks generated by collisions with drifting hydrogen clouds. In this way the Hyades probably lost much of its original population of M dwarfs, along with substantial numbers of brighter stars.

===Stellar multiplicity===
Another result of mass segregation is the concentration of binary systems in the cluster core. More than half of the known F and G stars are binaries, and these are preferentially located within this central region. As in the immediate Solar neighborhood, binarity increases with increasing stellar mass. The fraction of binary systems in the Hyades increases from 26% among K-type stars to 87% among A-type stars. Hyades binaries tend to have small separations, with most binary pairs in shared orbits whose semimajor axes are smaller than 50 astronomical units. Although the exact ratio of single to multiple systems in the cluster remains uncertain, this ratio has considerable implications for our understanding of its population. For example, Perryman and colleagues list about 200 high-probability Hyades members. If the binary fraction is 50%, the total cluster population would be at least 300 individual stars.

===Future evolution===
Surveys indicate that 90% of open clusters dissolve less than 1 billion years after formation, while only a tiny fraction survive for the present age of the Solar System (about 4.6 billion years). Over the next few hundred million years, the Hyades will continue to lose both mass and membership as its brightest stars evolve off the main sequence and its dimmest stars evaporate out of the cluster halo. It may eventually be reduced to a remnant containing about a dozen star systems, most of them binary or multiple, which will remain vulnerable to ongoing dissipative forces.

==Brightest stars==

This is a list of Hyades cluster member stars that are fourth magnitude or brighter.

==Planets==
Four stars in the Hyades have been found to host exoplanets. Epsilon Tauri has a superjovian planet, which was the first planet to be discovered in any open cluster. HD 285507 has a hot Jupiter, K2-25 has a Neptune-sized planet, and K2-136 has a system of three planets. Another star, HD 283869, may also host a planet, but this has not been confirmed as only one transit has been detected.

==In culture==
In the works of Robert W. Chambers, H. P. Lovecraft, and others, the fictional city of Carcosa is located on a planet in the Hyades.

A 2018 archaeoastronomical paper suggested that the Hyades may have inspired the Norse myth of Ragnarök. Astronomer Donald Olson questioned these findings, pointing out minor errors in the paper&#x27;s astronomical data.

<doc id="82491" wikidata="Q230578" url="?curid=82491" title="Fernando Henrique Cardoso">
<text>Fernando Henrique Cardoso (; born 18 June 1931), also known by his initials FHC (), is a Brazilian sociologist, professor, and politician who served as the 34th president of Brazil from 1 January 1995 to 1 January 2003. He was the first Brazilian president to be reelected for a subsequent term. An accomplished scholar of dependency theory noted for his research on slavery and political theory, Cardoso has earned many honors including the Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation (2000) and the Kluge Prize from the US Library of Congress (2012).

Cardoso was inaugurated as president on January 1, 1995. He continued the economic reforms that had been initiated by the previous administration, inflation rates remained low, several state-owned companies were privatized, and market liberalization increased the country&#x27;s visibility in the international market. The government succeeded in passing economic and administrative laws, including one that allowed for the reelection of executive officeholders. In 1998, he won the presidential election in the first round, becoming the first president to be reelected at the time. During his second term, international crises, a significant devaluation of the Real, the energy crisis, and other events led to a significant drop in his popularity. Currently, he heads the Fernando Henrique Cardoso Foundation, which he founded in 2004, and serves on various advisory boards for different organizations abroad, such as the Clinton Global Initiative, Brown University, and the United Nations Foundation. He is also a member of &quot;The Elders&quot;, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, and the honorary president of the PSDB (Brazilian Social Democracy Party).

He was also the 10th president of the International Sociological Association (1982–1986).

==Personal and professional life==

Cardoso descends from wealthy Portuguese immigrants. Some were politicians during the Empire of Brazil. He also has African ancestry, through a black great-great-grandmother and a mulatto great-grandmother. Cardoso described himself as &quot;slightly mulatto&quot; and allegedly said he has &quot;a foot in the kitchen&quot; (a nod to historical Brazilian domestic slavery).

Born in Rio de Janeiro, he lived in São Paulo for most of his life. Cardoso is a widower who was married to Ruth Vilaça Correia Leite Cardoso, an anthropologist, from 1953 until her death on 24 June 2008; they had three children. Educated as a sociologist, he was a professor of political science and sociology at the Universidade de São Paulo. and president of the International Sociological Association (ISA), from 1982 to 1986. He is a member of the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton), an honorary foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has written several books.

Cardoso was also associate director of Studies in the in Paris, then visiting professor at the and later Paris Nanterre University. He later gave lectures at British and US universities including Cambridge University, Stanford University, Brown University and the University of California, Berkeley. He is fluent in Portuguese, English, French, and Spanish, and can express himself in Italian and German.

After his presidency, he was appointed to a five-year term (2003–2008) as professor-at-large at Brown University&#x27;s Watson Institute for International Studies, where he is now on the board of overseers. Cardoso is a founding member of the University of Southern California Center on Public Diplomacy&#x27;s advisory board. In February 2005, he gave the fourth annual Kissinger Lecture on Foreign Policy and International Relations at the Library of Congress, Washington DC on &quot;&quot;Dependency and Development in Latin America&quot;.

In 2005, Cardoso was selected by the British magazine &quot;Prospect&quot; as being one of the world&#x27;s top one hundred living public intellectuals.

==Academic career==
Cardoso earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Social Sciences from Universidade de São Paulo in 1952, from where he also earned a Master&#x27;s and a Doctorate in Sociology. His doctoral thesis, under the supervision of Florestan Fernandes, examined the institution of slavery in Southern Brazil, critiquing, from a Marxist perspective, the dominant approach of Gilberto Freyre to the topic. It has since become a classic on the subject. Cardoso also received the Livre-Docência degree in 1963, the most senior level of academic recognition in Brazil, also from Universidade de São Paulo. In 1968, he received the title of Cathedratic Professor, holding the chair of Political Science at Universidade de São Paulo.

As he continued his academic career abroad in Chile and France after the tightening of the Brazilian military dictatorship, Cardoso published several books and papers on state bureaucracy, industrial elites and, particularly, dependency theory. His work on dependency would be his most acclaimed contribution to sociology and development studies, especially in the United States. After presiding the International Sociological Association from 1982 to 1986 Cardoso was selected as a Fulbright Program 40th anniversary distinguished fellow and in that capacity was a visiting scholar and lectured at Columbia University on democracy in Brazil. Cardoso currently gives speeches and classes abroad. In June 2013 he was elected as a member of Academia Brasileira de Letras. He said his election was due to recognition for his academic achievements, rather than his political career.

==Elections==
After his return to Brazil, Fernando Henrique engaged with the burgeoning democratic opposition to the military-dominated regime both as an intellectual and as a political activist. He became Senator from São Paulo for the former Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) in 1982, replacing Franco Montoro, the newly elected governor of São Paulo. In 1985, he ran unsuccessfully for mayor of São Paulo against former President Jânio Quadros. Ahead in the polls, he let himself be photographed in the mayor&#x27;s chair before the elections. Some attribute his loss to this episode.

Elected to the Senate in 1986 for the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), which MDB became after re-democratization, he joined a group of PMDB parliamentarians who left that party to found the Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) after previously held PMDB positions shifted to the right when the party filled with politicians who had collaborated with the dictatorship. As a senator, Cardoso took part in the 1987–1988 National Constituent Assembly that drafted and approved Brazil&#x27;s current Constitution in the wake of the country&#x27;s re-democratization. In the early stages of the Constituent Assembly&#x27;s work (from February to March 1987), Cardoso led the committee that drafted the internal rules of procedure, including the procedural rules governing the drafting of the Constitution itself. These rules of procedure were adopted by the Assembly and published on 25 March 1987. Until 1992, Cardoso served as Leader of the PSDB in the Senate. From October 1992 to May 1993, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under President Itamar Franco (PMDB).

From May 1993 to April 1994, he was Minister of Finance and resigned in April 1994 to launch a presidential campaign. In the 3 October election, he won the presidency in the first round of voting with 54% of the vote, more than twice that of his nearest opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. This is still the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a free election in Brazilian history. After the constitution was amended to allow a president to succeed himself, he won a second term almost as easily in 1998, taking 53% to Lula&#x27;s 31.7% to win in a single round. To date, he is the only president to win an outright majority of the popular vote, and the only one to win the presidency in a single round since the institution of the two-round system in 1989.

Cardoso was succeeded in 2003 by Lula da Silva, who ran for the fourth time and had come in second on prior attempts. Lula won in the runoff election against the Cardoso-supported candidate, José Serra. Lula&#x27;s election has been interpreted as resulting from Cardoso&#x27;s low approval ratings in his second term.

== Presidency (1995–2003) ==

 Cardoso, often nicknamed &quot;FHC&quot;, was elected with the support of a heterodox alliance of his own Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) and two right-wing parties, the Liberal Front Party (PFL) and the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB). Brazil&#x27;s largest party, the centrist Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB), joined Cardoso&#x27;s governing coalition after the election, as did the right-wing Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB) in 1996.

Party loyalty was not always strong, and coalition members did not always vote with the government. Cardoso had difficulty at times gaining support for some of his legislative priorities, even though his coalition held an overwhelming majority of the congressional seats. Nevertheless, many constitutional amendments were passed during his presidency.

Cardoso&#x27;s presidency saw institutional advancements in human rights, beginning with a national secretariat and a new government program, discussed with civil society, to address the issue. On 8 January 1996, he issued the controversial Decree 1775, which created a framework for the clear demarcation of indigenous territories, but which, as part of the process, opened indigenous territories to counterclaims by adjacent landowners. In 2000, Cardoso demanded the disclosure of some classified military files concerning Operation Condor, a network of South American military dictatorships that kidnapped and assassinated political opponents.

FHC was the first Brazilian President to address the inequality and the enormous gap between rich and poor. He started the following programs: Bolsa Escola, the Auxílio Gás, the Bolsa Alimentação, and the Cartão Alimentação.

His wife, Ruth Cardoso, focused on unifying transfer programs aimed at helping people suffering from poverty and hunger., by means of a program based on the idea that educating the poor could help raise them out of poverty.

Cardoso&#x27;s administration deepened the privatization program launched by president Fernando Collor de Mello. During his first term, several government-owned enterprises in areas such as steel milling, telecommunications and mining, such as &quot;Telebras&quot; and &quot;Companhia Vale do Rio Doce&quot; were sold to the private sector, the deepest denationalisation in Brazilian history, amidst a polarized political debate between &quot;neoliberals&quot; and &quot;developmentalists&quot;. Ironically, this time Cardoso was against the latter group, generating uproar among former academic colleagues and political allies who accused him of reneging on his previous intellectual work. Economists still contend over its long-term effects; some research suggests that companies sold by the government achieved better profitability as a result of their disengagement from the state.

Despite the sale of public assets, the years 1995 to 2002 saw a rise of the total public debt from 30% to 55.5% of GDP. Economists aligned with his government argued that this was due to external factors outside the control of the administration at the time, such as the devaluation of the Brazilian real and the growth of the share of the debt denominated in US dollars. Nevertheless, devaluation of the currency was an instrument of monetary policy used right after his reelection, when the real pegged to the dollar led to a financial crisis that saw the country lose much of its foreign reserve fund and raise its interest rates on government bonds to very high levels as he tried to stabilize the currency under a new free-floating regime. With this economic shift, the greatest achievement of Cardoso – his landmark lowering of inflation – was maintained, but his popularity plummeted.

Given his previous experience as Minister of Foreign Affairs and his prestige as an internationally famous sociologist, he was respected on the world scene, building friendships with such leaders as Bill Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo. Although he was respected abroad, in Brazil he had problems gaining support in Congress for government priorities and among people in general. As a result, major reforms planned by the executive branch, such as changes in the tax system and to social security, were only partially approved and only after long discussion. Although claiming to still support social democracy, his economic policies led people on the left to identify him with neoliberalism and right-wing politics, terms that often carry a very negative connotation in Latin American political debate and academic circles.
He also experienced personal problems with former ally Itamar Franco, his predecessor who later became Governor of Minas Gerais, a fierce opponent of his administrative reforms that saw the state lose its capacity to contract debt and forced a reduction of local government spending. Cardoso was also criticized for amending the constitution to his own benefit, allowing him to stay eight years in office. His popularity in his first four years, gained with the success of Plano Real, decreased during his last four years as the currency crisis was followed by lower economic growth and employment rates, greater public debt, growing political dissent, low levels of investment in appropriate infrastructure, and, finally, an energy crisis caused by an unexpected drought, as over 80% of Brazil&#x27;s electricity is hydroelectric. He publicly admitted that he could have done more for public security and for the creation of new jobs, but defended his policies in areas such as health and education.

Cardoso&#x27;s administration was accused of bribing congressmen to pass a constitutional amendment that secured FHC the right to seek reelection, which he eventually won.

==Post-presidency==

After stepping down from office, he assumed a position as a senior leader of his party and leading public voice in the opposition to the incumbent Workers&#x27; Party, writing extensively on Brazilian politics for newspapers and giving lectures and interviews. Nevertheless, his relatively low popularity rates among the general population have made his legacy a mixed blessing to his political allies, who are somewhat reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly during elections, especially on topics regarding privatization and social policy. In 2006, he helped the campaign of the PSDB candidate for the Presidency, Geraldo Alckmin, and has reiterated that he does not wish to run for office again. In the 2022 presidential election, Cardoso endorsed his former Workers&#x27; Party rival Lula over then-incumbent Jair Bolsonaro.


He dedicates his time to a personal institute which he founded in São Paulo, based on the model of bodies created by former presidents of the United States, has written two books about his experience as president of Brazil and advocates for relaxation of criminal laws relating to drugs, generating both criticism and praise. He lectures at Brown University about Brazilian economic policy, urban development, and deforestation and has taught as a guest lecturer at Sciences Po in Paris. Also, in 2007 he became a member of the editorial board of the Latin American policy publication &quot;Americas Quarterly&quot;, for which he is an occasional contributor.

Since leaving the Brazilian presidency, Cardoso has been involved in a number of international organisations and initiatives. He is a member of the Club of Madrid and was its president from 2003 to 2006. He has been a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, ever since the Foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac to promote world peace. Cardoso is a founding member of Washington D.C.–based think tank The Inter-American Dialogue as well as former chair of the organization&#x27;s board. He is also a former director of World Resources Institute.

Cardoso has a particular interest in drug policy. He served on the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy and later chaired the Global Commission on Drug Policy. He appeared as an interviewee in 2011 documentary Breaking the Taboo, which explores the conclusion reached by the Global Commission on Drug Policy in 2011 that drug liberalization is the best approach in dealing with drug policy.

Cardoso is also a member of The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues. In August 2009, he travelled to Israel and the West Bank as the head of an Elders delegation that also included Ela Bhatt, Gro Harlem Brundtland, Jimmy Carter, Mary Robinson and Desmond Tutu.

In 2013 he became a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters.

In 2017, Cardoso received the Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award from the Inter-American Dialogue.

<text>Slow cutting is a film editing technique characterized by frequent lengthy shots. Though it depends on context, it is estimated that any shot longer than about fifteen seconds will seem rather slow to many modern-day viewers, especially those who are accustomed to mainstream Western movies, where slow cuts are uncommon. 

Slow cutting can be used to establish a mood before fast cutting injects energy. Slow cutting may also be used in scenes of calm or reflection, and filmmakers can use slow cutting to slow down the pace, just as the second movement of a symphony or concerto typically does.

==Films and television==

Notable films that use the slow cutting technique are: &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Russian Ark&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;The Omen&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Robocop&quot;, and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

American director Ken Burns used slow cutting for his television documentary series about the Vietnam War. 

==Directors==
Most of the early films directed by Michelangelo Antonioni use slow cutting. Other directors known for the technique include: George Marshall, John Stahl, Edmund Goulding, George Cukor, John Farrow, and Ernst Lubitsch.

<text>Fast cutting is a film editing technique which refers to several consecutive shots of a brief duration (e.g. 3 seconds or less). It can be used to quickly convey much information, or to imply either energy or chaos. Fast cutting is also frequently used when shooting dialogue between two or more characters, changing the viewer&#x27;s perspective to either focus on the reaction of another character&#x27;s dialog, or to bring to attention the non-verbal actions of the speaking character.

One famous example of fast cutting is the shower scene in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960).

More recent examples include the can-can scene in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; (2001).

The film &quot;Mind Game&quot; makes extensive use of fast cutting to convey hundreds of short scenes in the space of fifteen minutes.

In &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, fast cutting is used to quickly tell stories about minor characters to show how the casual actions of the protagonists have profound impact on what happens to them.

In various moments in the &quot;Saw&quot; movies, fast cutting is used frequently during trap scenes, which represent their frantic struggle to escape the trap.

Director Michael Bay makes extensive use of fast-cutting in many of his feature films. He uses the technique most prominently during action sequences, in which it is used to make the action more energetic and intense.

==Hip hop montage==
A &quot;hip hop montage&quot; is a subset of fast cutting used in film to portray a complex action through a rapid series of simple actions in fast motion, accompanied by sound effects. The technique was first given its name by Darren Aronofsky, who used the technique in his films &quot;Pi&quot; and &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; to portray drug use. According to the director&#x27;s commentary of &quot;Requiem for a Dream,&quot; the hip hop montage is used in film as a sample is used in hip hop, with a few moments of film or video, respectively, repeated throughout the work for effect. The technique is derived from the hip hop culture of the 1990s and jump cuts first pioneered in the French new wave.

It was used earlier in Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. Guy Ritchie also used the technique in &quot;Snatch&quot; to portray transcontinental travel. The work of Edgar Wright, most notably in his collaboration with Simon Pegg (&quot;Spaced&quot;, &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, and &quot;The World&#x27;s End&quot;) uses the technique for comedic effect.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt used the technique extensively in &quot;Don Jon&quot; (2013) to portray the main character&#x27;s habits.

<text>Hygieia is a goddess from Greek mythology (also referred to as: Hygiea or Hygeia; ; or , or ). Hygieia is a goddess of health ( – &quot;hugieia&quot;), cleanliness and hygiene. Her name is the source for the word &quot;hygiene&quot;. Hygieia developed from a light personification to a full goddess within the cult of Asklepios. Together with her father, she appeared in dreams of patients who visited their temples. Patients performed the healing ritual temple sleep to get healed.

Hygieia is related to the Greek god of medicine, Asclepius, who is the son of the Olympian god Apollo. Hygieia is most commonly referred to as a daughter of Asclepius and his wife Epione. Hygieia and her four sisters each performed a facet of Apollo&#x27;s art: Hygieia (health, cleanliness, and sanitation); Panacea (universal remedy); Iaso (recuperation from illness); Aceso (the healing process); and Aegle (radiant good health).

== The role of Hygieia in antiquity ==
One notable reference regarding Hygieia&#x27;s role as a goddess of health can be found within the Hippocratic oath. This oath is used by physicians in order to swear before various healing gods, one of which being Hygieia, that they would follow a code of established ethical standards of practice.

Section of the translated oath from Greek to English:

: I swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will carry out, according to my ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.

== Hygieia and Asclepius ==
The worship of Hygieia was closely associated with the cult of Asclepius. While Asclepius was more directly associated with healing, Hygieia was associated with the prevention of sickness and the continuation of good health. In the second century CE, the famous traveler Pausanias provided an account based on what he witnessed within the state of Greece. In his encyclopedic text &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, written circa 160 CE to 174 CE, Pausanias described encountering statues of Asclepius and Hygieia, located at Tegea.

In addition to statues which represent the two figures, the incorporation of Hygieia within the cult of Asclepius can also be seen in medical iconography on numerous ancient Graeco-Roman coins. The close association between Hygieia and Asclepius indicates the important place she held in the cult of Asclepius.

==Worship==

Hygieia&#x27;s primary temples were in Epidaurus, Corinth, Cos and Pergamon. At the Asclepeion of Titane in Sicyon (founded by Alexanor, Asclepius&#x27; grandson), the Greek historian Pausanias remarked that a statue of Hygieia was covered by women&#x27;s hair and pieces of Babylonian clothes. According to inscriptions, similar sacrifices such as this were offered at Paros.

Hygieia was also associated with the Greek goddess Athena. In the 2nd century AD, Pausanias noted statues both of Hygieia and of Athena Hygieia near the entrance to the Acropolis of Athens. &quot;Athena Hygieia&quot; was one of the cult titles given to Athena, as Plutarch recounts of the building of the Parthenon (447–432 BC):
However, the cult of Hygieia as an independent goddess did not begin to spread until the Delphic oracle recognized her, after the devastating Plague of Athens (430–427 BC), and in Rome after the 293 BC plague there.

The poet Ariphron, from the Greek city-state Sicyon, wrote a well-known hymn during the 4th century BC which celebrated Hygieia. Statues of Hygieia were created by Scopas, Bryaxis and Timotheus, among others, but there is no clear description of what they looked like. In the surviving depictions, she is often shown as a young woman feeding a large snake that was wrapped around her body or drinking from a jar that she carried. These attributes were later adopted by the Gallo-Roman healing goddess, Sirona.

Hygieia was modified by the Romans into the goddess Valetudo, the goddess of personal health. There exists some debate about whether Hygieia can also be identified with the Roman goddess of social welfare, Salus; however, this has yet to be fully substantiated.

== Recent discoveries ==
In August 2021, archaeologists from Dumlupınar University announced the discovery of statue of Hygieia in the Ancient Greek city Aizanoi. The human sized statue was portrayed with a snake in its arms. The statue was revealed inside the columned gallery throughout the south wing of the agora.

<text>Pelopidas (; ; died 364 BC) was an important Theban statesman and general in Greece, instrumental in establishing the mid-fourth century Theban hegemony.

==Biography==
===Athlete and warrior===
Pelopidas was a member of a distinguished family and possessed great wealth, which he expended on his friends and on public service while he himself was content to lead the rough life of an athlete. In 384 BC, he served in a Theban contingent sent to the support of the Spartans during the Siege of Mantinea, where he was saved, when dangerously wounded by the Arcadians, by Epaminondas and Agesipolis.

::Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both.

Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas&#x27;s partner in politics for the next 20 years.
According to Plutarch&#x27;s Life of Pelopidas (from Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; in which Pelopidas&#x27;s life was paired with the life of Marcellus), he lessened his inherited estate by showing constant care for the deserving poor of Thebes, taking pleasure in simple clothing, a sparse diet, and the constant hardships of military life. People said that he was ashamed to spend more on himself than the lowest of the Thebans spent on himself. Once, when friends argued that he needed to care for his finances since he had a wife and children, and that money was a necessary thing, Pelopidas pointed to a blind, crippled pauper named Nicodemus and said, &quot;Yes, necessary for Nicodemus.&quot;

Upon the seizure of the Theban citadel by the Spartans (382 BC), Pelopidas fled to Athens and took the lead in a conspiracy to liberate Thebes. The Spartans, though royalists in their own state, installed oligarchic governments in the city-states they conquered in pursuit of the Spartan hegemony. In 379 BC, Pelopidas&#x27; democratic faction rose in a surprise revolt and killed many of the corrupted Theban aristocrats supporting Spartan rule. The Spartan garrison surrendered to an army gathered by Pelopidas.

===Boeotarch===

In this and 12 subsequent years, he was elected &quot;boeotarch&quot;, or warleader, and around 375 BC, he routed a much larger Spartan force at the Battle of Tegyra (near Orchomenus). This victory he owed mainly to the valour of the Sacred Band, an elite corps of 300 seasoned soldiers. At the Battle of Leuctra (371 BC), he contributed greatly to the success of Epaminondas&#x27;s new tactics by the rapidity with which he made the Sacred Band close with the Spartans. At Leuctra, Epaminondas, a brilliant and intuitive general, used the oblique order for the first time. After the battle at Leuctra, Thebes began to replace Sparta as the leading city of Greece.

In 370 BC, he accompanied his close friend Epaminondas as &quot;boeotarch&quot; into the Peloponnese, where, by re-founding as an independent city Messene Sparta&#x27;s former dependency, they were able to consolidate their success and permanently deprive Sparta of its hegemonic power. On their return, both generals were accused, unsuccessfully, of having retained their command beyond the legal term. In fact, the democrats and some aristocrats of Thebes acknowledged that Pelopidas and Epaminondas were the two most capable and important personalities of their city. Both were trying to establish a state that would unite Greece under the Theban hegemony – what Xenophon called a policy &quot;continuously direct towards securing supremacy in Greece&quot;.

===Embassy to Persia===
In 367 BC, Pelopidas went on an embassy to the Persian king Artaxerxes II. Backed by the prestige of his Leuctra victory, Pelopidas was able to induce the king to prescribe a settlement of Greece according to the wishes of the Thebans, with particular reference to the continuing independence of Messene.

===Thessalian campaign and death===

The 360s saw Pelopidas leading a military/diplomatic advance by Theban power into Central and Northern Greece. In 369 BC, in response to a petition of the Thessalians, Pelopidas was sent with an army against Alexander of Pherae. After driving Alexander out, he passed into Macedon and arbitrated between two claimants to the throne. In order to secure the influence of Thebes in Macedon, he brought home hostages, including the king&#x27;s younger brother Philip, a young man who would one day become king himself. In Thebes, Philip learned about the military tactics and politics of the Greeks.

The next year, Pelopidas was again called upon to interfere in Macedonia, but being deserted by his mercenaries, was compelled to make an agreement with Ptolemy of Aloros. On his return through Thessaly, he was seized by Alexander of Pherae, and two expeditions (the second expedition, the successful one, was led by his friend Epaminondas) from Thebes were needed to secure his release.

In 364 BC, he received another appeal from the Thessalian towns against Alexander of Pherae. Although an eclipse of the sun prevented his bringing with him more than a handful of troops, he overthrew the tyrant&#x27;s far superior force on the ridge of Cynoscephalae. However, wishing to slay Alexander with his own hand, he rushed forward too eagerly and was cut down by the tyrant&#x27;s guards. Plutarch considered him a prime example of a leader who threw away his life through recklessness and anger.

<text>The Asclepieion ( &quot;Asklepieion&quot;; Ἀσκλαπιεῖον in Doric dialect; Latin &quot;aesculapīum&quot;), plurally Asclepieia, was a healing temple in ancient Greece (and in the wider Hellenistic and Roman world) that was dedicated to Asclepius, the first doctor-demigod in Greek mythology. Asclepius was said to have been such a skilled doctor that he could even raise people from the dead. Stemming from the myth of his great healing powers, pilgrims would flock to temples built in his honor in order to seek spiritual and physical healing.

Asclepieia included carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing. Treatment at these temples largely centered around promoting healthy lifestyles, with a particular emphasis on a person&#x27;s spiritual needs. Characteristic of the Asclepieion was the practice of &quot;incubatio&quot;, also known as &#x27;temple sleep.&#x27; This was a process by which patients would go to sleep in the temple with the expectation that they would be visited by Asclepius himself or one of his healing children in their dream. During this time, they would be told what it is that they needed to do in order to cure their ailment. At the very least, they would wake up having not been directly visited by a deity and instead report their dream to a priest. The priest would then interpret the dream and prescribe a cure, often a visit to the baths or a gymnasium. The preliminary treatment for admission into the Asclepieia was catharsis, or purification. It consisted of a series of cleansing baths and purgations, accompanied by a cleansing diet, which lasted several days.

Despite these methods being regarded as ‘faith healing,’ they were highly effective, as is evident by the numerous written accounts by patients attesting to their healing and providing detailed accounts of their cure. In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, with the patient in a dream-like state of induced sleep known as &quot;enkoimesis&quot; (), not unlike anesthesia, induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium.

Asclepieia also became home to future physicians as well. Hippocrates is said to have received his medical training at an asclepieion on the isle of Kos. Prior to becoming the personal physician to the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Galen treated and studied at the famed asclepieion at Pergamon.

== Asclepius and his cult ==
In Greek mythology and religion, Asclepius was the god of medicine – son of the god Apollo and mortal Coronis. His name was said to mean &quot;cut open&quot;. It is said that he was so named as a result of his mother&#x27;s childbirth experience, during which time her womb had to be cut open in order for Asclepius to be born (now known as a cesarean section). In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Asclepius was a man, a physician to soldiers wounded on the battlefield at Troy. But by Hippocrates&#x27; day, he had become elevated to the status of a god.

Asclepius’ father Apollo was himself a patron god of medicine. It was through Apollo that Chiron, the wise and peaceful centaur, learned the art of healing. Under Apollo&#x27;s mentorship, Chiron grew in his craft so much so that Apollo himself entrusted Chiron to train his son, Asclepius. Through his studies, Asclepius became so deft at medicine, especially the art of surgery, that he was able to return the living from the dead. His abilities quickly drew attention and jealousy from the other gods. As one story goes, Asclepius was killed by Zeus at the request of Hades, the god of the underworld, who feared Asclepius was stealing souls away from him. Before his death, however, Asclepius had several children, including: Machaon, Podalirius, Hygeia, and Panacea, who themselves were regarded as highly effective healers.

Starting around 350 BC, the cult of Asclepius became increasingly popular. He was admired for serving people despite their class and social status, which was not a common practice by Olympians. Doctors claiming to be the direct descendants of Asclepius referred to themselves as “Asclepiads.” The symbol of a snake wrapped around a staff, which is widely used by modern medical institutions, such as the American Medical Association, is modelled on the staff that Asclepius carried.

== Asclepieia temples ==

Over 300 asclepieia have been discovered throughout ancient Greece. Among the most famous of the temples were Trikka, Epidaurus, island of Kos, Athens, Corinth and Pergamon. These temples were often located in secluded locations surrounded modern spas or mountain sanatoriums. These sanctuaries could attract diverse audiences for various needs other than healing, which makes these spaces more complex than merely healing spaces.

Also characteristic of these temples were the presence of dogs and nonvenomous snakes, known as Aesculapian snake, who would frequent the halls and dormitories and who played an important role in healing activities.

Asclepius may first have been worshipped as a hero in Trikka (modern Trikala), Thessaly, Greece. Ancient mythographers generally regarded Trikka as the place of Asclepius&#x27; birth, but to date archaeological excavations have yet to uncover his sanctuary there. Epidaurus, on the other hand, was the first place to worship Asclepius as a god, beginning sometime in the 5th century BC. The asclepieion at Epidaurus is both extensive and well preserved. There is also an asclepieion located on the south slopes of the Acropolis of Athens which dates to around 420 BC.

Located on the Argolid plain of the east Peloponnese in Greece, Epidaurus was the main asclepieion. The healing temple was named after Asclepius, the son of Apollo. At the Epidaurus, there were various people such as physicians and priests who would assist those who sought a session of healing from these professionals. Patients would come pay homage to the gods by making pilgrimages to the site, performing a prayer or a sacrifice, giving monetary gifts or even sleep at the temple. The Epidaurus also served as a sanctuary for those who were extremely ill. It was eventually expanded to a one hundred eighty-room institution to house the dying and women in labour during the Roman Empire.

== Procedures performed at asclepieia ==
Signature to asclepian medicine was its holistic approach to patient care. It emphasized therapy through the natural environment, hence the carefully chosen locations, as well as care for the patient&#x27;s psychological and emotional states. By attending to these things, the patient&#x27;s innate healing mechanisms were activated, which promoted recovery.

There were two steps in order for a patient to be considered to be treated in the asclepieion. The first of which is the Katharsis or purification stage. This is when a patient undergoes a series of baths and other methods of purging, such as a clean diet over a series of several days or purging their emotions through art. The patient would then make an offering such as money or a prayer to the temple, therefore to Asclepius. The priest of the temple then gives the patient a prayer in which it would ease the patient&#x27;s mind and create a more positive outlook for them.

Afterwards, comes incubation or dream therapy. Patients would sleep in the “Abaton” or “Enkoimeterion,” which was a dormitory located in the asclepieion. Here, they would be lulled into a hypnotic state, and begin their dream journey. As they slept, they were visited by Asclepius or his daughters Hygeia and Panacea. These dream visitations were prognostic in nature, revealing the projected course of the disease and ultimate patient outcomes. During this time, patients would also discover what it was they needed to do once they woke in order to treat their disease. Upon awakening, the patient would recount their dream to a temple priest, who would then prescribe a treatment based on their interpretation. Other dreams were less direct, and more symbolic. The physician - priests at the Asclepions were also master dream interpreters who would divine the treatment to be followed from the patient&#x27;s account of the dream. The god Asclepius had certain totem animals in whose guise he liked to visit the supplicants as they slept. These were the dog, the rooster, and of course, the snake.

<text>In ancient Greek religion, Telesphorus (Greek: Τελεσφόρος &quot;Telesphoros&quot;) was a minor child-god of healing. He was a possible son of Asclepius and frequently accompanied his sister Hygieia. He was depicted as a dwarf whose head was always covered with a cowl hood or cap.

He symbolized recovery from illness, as his name means &quot;the accomplisher&quot; or &quot;bringer of completion&quot; in Greek. Representations of him are found mainly in Anatolia and along the Danube.

== Origin and duties ==
Telesphorus is assumed to have been a Celtic god in origin, who was taken to Anatolia by the Galatians in the 3rd century BC, where he would have become associated with the Greek god of medicine, Asclepius, perhaps in Pergamon (an Asclepian cult center) and spread again to the West due to the rise of the Roman Empire, in particular during the 2nd century AD, from the reign of Hadrian. Telesphorus has been identified with the Genius Cucullatus invoked on two inscriptions in Noricum.

It is suggested by many scholars that Telesphorus was a protector of children for the healing gods. Ancient hymns honor and thank Telesphorus for guarding and favoring the birth of their healthy children. He is also depicted as the protective divinity of an Attican fraternity in lists from the third century BC. Statuettes recovered from two children&#x27;s graves in Stobi, dated to the second century BC, depict Telesphorus together with a child and lead many scholars to believe that Telesphorus was thought to protect children even in death. Other representations of the deity have him depicted as a child as well.

== Family ==
Telesphorus was the youngest son of Asclepius, the god of medicine. He had five older sisters, Iaso, Hygieia, Panacea, Aceso, and Aglaia. He is frequently depicted accompanying his sister Hygieia in statues; Telesphorus, Hygieia, and Asclepius are often shown as a trio in inscriptions and coins.

Telesphorus was referred to as different names in different regions. In the Sanctuary of Asclepius at Titane, the statue erected is called Euamerion; in Epidaurus, the statue is called Acesis, which means cure; and in Pergamon, it is called Telesphorus. Telesphorus is the only one of the three names to be cited as a child of Asclepius in an Attican inscription from the second century AD.

== Temple of Telesphorus ==

The temple of Telesphorus was a two-story dormitory in the Sanctuary of Asclepius, located in Pergamon, Turkey. According to Aristides, there were three temples: the north temple dedicated to Apollo, the middle temple dedicated to Hygieia and Telesphorus, and the south temple dedicated to Asclepius. These temples were used as sanctuaries for healing rituals conducted by priests, and they were built high up on a rocky outcrop of land known as the &quot;Felsbarre&quot;. A nearby spring fed water to multiple fountains and was sometimes used in the healing processes. Access to the temple was granted through a dark underground passageway which still exists today. A patient would be led through this passageway, into the temple, and be instructed to lie down at the base of a statue of Asclepius. The patient would be told that Asclepius or one of his children would appear to them in a dream and grant them health-giving powers. Once the patient was asleep though, priests had the opportunity to mend to their wounds. The temple was purposefully kept in the dark so that when a patient awoke, they would be granted by daylight; the contrast between dark and light created a psychological juxtaposition between sick and healthy in the patient&#x27;s mind.

== Cult of Telesphorus ==
The cult of Telesphorus grew around Athens, Attica, and Thessaly; a third century AD eulogy from the area thanks Asclepius, Hygieia, and Telesphorus for their help in intervening an epidemic. The cult also bled into the Thracian area, where the cult becomes assimilated under the epithet Παυταλιωται.
== Coinage ==
Telesphorus first began to appear on coins in the third century during the reign of Caracalla, specifically appearing on provincial bronze coins. One coin, struck in Lydia circa 210 AD, depicts Caracalla on the obverse and Caracalla consulting Asclepius, Telesphorus, and Salus (the Roman equivalent of Hygieia) on the reverse. Another coin shows Asclepius and Telesphorus being recognized in conjunction as medical deities whose duties were to bring care and power to the atonement of health. Telesphorus also appears on a bronze medallion with Asclepius and Caracalla, which is believed to have been struck on the same day Caracalla left for Pergamus. This was to ensure that Caracalla were to be cured of his corporeal ailments and mind&#x27;s diseases.

<doc id="82505" wikidata="Q461599" url="?curid=82505" title="Battle of Leuctra">
<text>The Battle of Leuctra (, ) was fought on 6 July 371 BC between the Boeotians led by the Thebans, and the Spartans along with their allies amidst the post–Corinthian War conflict. The battle took place in the vicinity of Leuctra, a village in Boeotia in the territory of Thespiae. The Theban victory shattered Sparta&#x27;s immense influence over the Greek peninsula, which Sparta had gained with its victory in the Peloponnesian War a generation earlier.

==Prelude==

In 371 BC, the newly established democracy of Thebes had elected four Boeotarchs, the traditional title of the generals of the Boeotian League, and so proclaimed their intention of reconstituting the aforementioned league that Sparta had disbanded. During this period, Thebes had an ally in Athens, but Athens was far from happy with the treatment Plataea had received. When it came to swearing an oath to respect the treaty, Sparta swore on behalf of itself and its allies. When Epaminondas came forward, asking to swear on behalf of the whole Boeotian League, the Spartans refused, saying he could swear as the representative of Thebes or not at all. This Epaminondas refused. (According to Xenophon, the Thebans signed as &quot;the Thebans&quot;, and asked the next day to change their signature to &quot;the Boeotians&quot;, but one of the Spartan kings, Agesilaus II, would not allow it.) In this, Sparta saw an opportunity to reassert its shaky authority in central Greece. Hence, the other Spartan king, Cleombrotus I, marched to war from Phocis.
Rather than take the expected easier route into Boeotia through the face defile, the Spartans marched over the hills via Thisbae and took the fortress of Creusis (along with twelve Theban warships) before the Thebans were aware of their presence, and then proceeded to Leuctra where they were confronted by the Boeotian army. Initially, the six Boeotian generals present were equally divided as to whether to offer battle, with Epaminondas being the main advocate in favor of battle. Only when a seventh arrived and sided with Epaminondas was the decision made. In spite of inferior numbers and the doubtful loyalty of their allies, the Boeotians would offer battle on the plain before the town.

==Size of the armies==
Several ancient writers give figures for one or both of the armies, but, unfortunately, they are contradictory and, in some cases, unbelievable. Modern scholars&#x27; estimates have varied from 6,000 to 9,000 for the Boeotian force. For the Spartan side, most modern scholars favor Plutarch&#x27;s figure of 10,000 in infantry and 1,000 cavalry.

==Battle==

The battle opened with the Spartans&#x27; mercenary peltasts (slingers, javeliniers, and/or skirmishers) attacking and driving back the Boeotian camp followers and others who were reluctant to fight. According to Xenophon, the Boeotian camp followers were trying to leave the field, as they did not intend to fight; this Spartan action drove them back into the Theban army, inadvertently making the Theban force stronger. There followed a cavalry engagement, in which the Thebans drove their enemies off the field. Initially, the Spartan infantry were sent into disarray when their retreating cavalry hopelessly disrupted Cleombrotus&#x27;s attempt to outflank the Theban left column. At this point the Theban left hit the Spartan right with the Sacred Band of Thebes, a troop made up of all male lovers, led by Pelopidas, at its head. The decisive engagement was then fought between the Theban and Spartan infantry.

The normal practice of the Spartans (and, indeed, the Greeks in general) was to establish their heavily armed infantry in a solid mass, or phalanx, some eight to twelve men deep. This was considered to allow for the best balance between depth (the pushing power it provided) and width (i.e., area of coverage of the phalanx&#x27;s front battle line). The infantry would advance together so that the attack flowed unbroken against their enemy. In order to combat the phalanx&#x27;s famous right-hand drift, Greek commanders traditionally placed their most experienced, highly regarded and, generally, deadliest troops on the right wing, as this was the place of honor. By contrast, the shakiest and/or least influential troops were often placed on the left wing. In the Spartan battleplan, therefore, the hippeis (an elite force numbering 300 men) and the king of Sparta would stand on the right wing of the phalanx.
In a major break with tradition, Epaminondas massed his cavalry and a fifty-deep column of Theban infantry on his left wing, and sent forward this body against the Spartan right. His shallower and weaker center and right wing columns were drawn up so that they were progressively further to the right and rear of the proceeding column, in an Echelon formation. The Theban center and right were held back, screened by skirmishers and cavalry. The infantry engaged, and the Thebans smashed the Spartan right wing. The Spartans&#x27; twelve-deep formation on their right wing could not sustain the heavy impact of their opponents&#x27; 50-deep column. The Spartan right was hurled back with a loss of about 1,000 men, of whom 400 were some of Sparta&#x27;s most experienced soldiers, including King Cleombrotus I.

Wilhelm Rüstow and Hermann Köchly, writing in the 19th century, believed that Pelopidas led the Sacred Band out from the column to attack the Spartans in the flank. Hans Delbrück considered this to be a mere misreading of Plutarch. Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there is nothing in his account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered not because they were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.

Seeing their right wing beaten, the rest of the Peloponnesians, who were essentially unwilling participants, retired and left the enemy in possession of the field.

==Aftermath==
The arrival of a Thessalian army under Jason of Pherae persuaded a relieving Spartan force under Archidamus not to heap folly on folly and to withdraw instead, while the Thebans were persuaded not to continue the attack on the surviving Spartans. The Thebans somewhat bent the rules by insisting on conditions under which the Spartans and allies recovered the dead and by erecting a permanent rather than perishable trophy – something that was scrutinized by later writers. Diodorus claimed the Spartan loss was believed by some to have been foretold by a comet.

==Historical significance==

The battle is of great significance in Greek history.

The use of these tactics by Epaminondas was, perhaps, a direct result of the use of some similar maneuvers by Pagondas, his countryman, during the
Battle of Delium. Further, Philip II of Macedon, who studied and lived in Thebes, was no doubt heavily influenced by the battle to develop his own, highly effective approach to tactics and armament. In turn, his son, Alexander, would go on to develop his father&#x27;s theories to an entirely new level. Many innovations of Philip and Alexander are traced to this battle. Concentration of force, refused flank, and combined arms were tactics that they used in many of their battles. Philip&#x27;s victories against the Illyrians and at Chaeronea and Alexander&#x27;s triumphs at the Granicus, Issus, Gaugamela, and the Hydaspes owe credit to the tactical maneuver used to vanquish the Spartans.

Historians Victor Davis Hanson and Donald Kagan have argued that Epaminondas&#x27; oblique formation was not an intentional and preconceived innovation in infantry tactics, but was rather a clever response to circumstances. Because Epaminondas had stacked his left wing to a depth of fifty shields, the rest of his units were naturally left with far fewer troops than normal. This means that their maintenance of a depth of eight to twelve shields had to come at the expense of either number of companies or their width. Because Epaminondas was already outnumbered, he had no choice but to form fewer companies and march them diagonally toward the much longer Spartan line in order to engage as much of it as possible. Hanson and Kagan&#x27;s argument is therefore that the tactic was more dilatory than anything else. Whatever its motivation, the fact remains that the tactic did represent an innovation and was undoubtedly highly effective.

The battle&#x27;s political effects were far-reaching: the losses in material strength and prestige (prestige being an inestimably important factor in the Peloponnesian War) sustained by the Spartans at Leuctra and subsequently at the Battle of Mantinea were key in depriving them forever of their supremacy in Greece. Therefore, the battle permanently altered the Greek balance of power, as Sparta was deprived of its former prominence and was reduced to a second-rate power among the Greek city-states.

Theban supremacy in Greece was short-lived, as it was subsequently lost to the Macedonians, led by Philip II.

==In popular culture==
The battle is fictionalized, though in some detail, in David Gemmell&#x27;s book, &quot;Lion of Macedon&quot;, which includes the significant deviation from historical canon in that it is credited to a young Parmenio(n) instead of Epaminondas, who serves merely to gain permission to carry out the echelon tactic. The battle is also the subject of Victor Davis Hanson&#x27;s 2011 historical fiction novel, &quot;The End of Sparta&quot;. The battle was also featured in an episode of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Time Commanders&quot;. It was also featured in the historical fiction graphic novel &quot;Serpent and Prey&quot;, which takes few creative liberties with the battle&#x27;s portrayal.

In &quot;The Expanse: Persepolis Rising&quot; by James S.A. Corey, the final major engagement is referred to as the &quot;Battle of Point Leuctra&quot; in a literary homage to the historical battle.

<doc id="82507" wikidata="Q7965627" url="?curid=82507" title="Walter Mercado">
<text>Walter Mercado Salinas (March 9, 1932 – November 2, 2019), also known by his stage name Shanti Ananda, was a Puerto Rican astrologer, actor, dancer, and writer, best known as a television personality for his shows as an astrologer. His astrological prediction shows began airing in Puerto Rico, eventually spreading to Latin America and the United States. Walter became known as a cultural phenomenon in the Hispanic community.

== Early years ==
Mercado was born on March 9, 1932, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, where he spent his early childhood. His parents were José María Mercado, from San Germán, Puerto Rico, and Aída Salinas from Catalonia, Spain. Mercado believed that he had spiritual abilities, even as a child. He attended university majoring in pedagogy, psychology and pharmacy, and used these skills to teach others, to study the human mind and to learn about the healing properties of medicinal plants.

== Professional career ==
=== Dancing and acting ===
Mercado Salinas studied singing and had a talent for dancing. He also studied classical and modern ballet. He was one of the most prolific dancers in Puerto Rico. He was the dancing partner of comedian Velda González.

Walter Mercado worked as an actor in the 1960s Puerto Rican telenovelas &quot;Un adiós en el recuerdo&quot; (A Farewell to the Memory) and &quot;Larga distancia&quot; (Long Distance), and also had a dramatic arts school called Walter Actors Studio 64.

=== Astrology ===

His TV debut as an entertainer came when Puerto Rican producer Elín Ortíz invited him to perform on his TV show when one guest artist did not show up. Walter Mercado happened to be at the station and Ortiz asked Mercado to use the 25-minute allotment scheduled for the other guest, to make astrological predictions wearing colorful and extravagant robes. After that, Mercado was made a regular in the show making astrological predictions. He would frequently appear in heavily decorated costumes and capes.

In 1970, Mercado started his regular astrology segment in &quot;El Show de las 12&quot;. He enhanced his studies with formal study into astrology, tarot, and other occult disciplines. Mercado hosted a weekly astrology television show at WKAQ-TV, Channel 2/Telemundo. After several years, when the network changed its programming, Mercado moved his show to WRIK-TV (channel 7 in Ponce) where he hosted it for many years. Westinghouse was a steady and long-time sponsor. In the 1980s, his show was seen on several TV channels throughout Latin America and the United States. When Tommy Muñiz bought WRIK-TV, Mercado stayed for two years then moved his show to WKBM-TV, Channel 11/Tele Once (later renamed WLII-TV/Univision). In addition to the TV programs, Mercado also wrote his predictions for newspapers, magazines, and web pages. He was a syndicated writer in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;. He also appeared on various radio segments.

In 1986, Mercado was awarded the title &quot;Mr. Televisión&quot; by the &quot;Asociación de Cronistas del Espectáculo de Nueva York&quot; (Association of Latin Entertainment Critics of New York). By the end of the 1980s, Mercado had authored seven books, of which one, &quot;Más allá del horizonte&quot; (&quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot;), was published in Spanish, English and Portuguese.

From the mid-1990s until 2010, Mercado&#x27;s show aired in the Univision network throughout the Americas, but on 8 January 2010, after a fifteen-year relationship, he announced that he and Univision had parted ways. He was managed by entrepreneur Bill Bakula. In 2005, he was invited to appear on Welsh singer/songwriter Lisa Scott-Lee’s show &quot;Totally Scott-Lee&quot; to give her a special reading. From 1994 to 2009, he also appeared on &quot;Primer Impacto&quot;, which airs on the Univision network in the United States.

Other ventures Mercado was involved with in the mid-2010s included a dating website; a line of Zodiac-themed soaps and hygiene items; and a popular personal website and app offering daily horoscopes and more. His eponymous website received over 1 million visits in the first month. On a limited basis, Mercado continued to make public appearances during this time period as well.

=== Name change and legal challenge ===
In October 2010, Mercado changed his name to &quot;Shanti Ananda&quot;, a translation in Sanskrit of &quot;peace happiness.&quot; He said a &quot;being of light&quot; imparted a spiritual revelation to him, which he referred to as his &quot;authentic mystic name.&quot;

In January 2012, Mercado lost a lawsuit against Bart Enterprises International. He was trying to prevent it from using his name and likeness in future commercial ventures. Mercado signed a contract with the company in 1995. He severed ties with the company in 2006, which resulted in litigation being filed by both parties against each other. Chief Judge Sandra Lynch of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that Bart Enterprises can continue using Mercado&#x27;s name and likeness in future commercial projects. When asked about his legal case over the rights to his name, he replied, &quot;I worked for many years, and gave some releases without thinking much about human wickedness.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 2003, he announced that he maintained a &quot;spiritual relationship&quot; with the Brazilian actress and dancer Mariette Detotto, with whom he shared a TV program. In archival and recent interview clips on his life shown in a 2020 documentary, &quot;Mucho Mucho Amor: The Legend of Walter Mercado&quot;, Mercado defined himself as androgynous and insisted that the primary relationship of his life was with his fans; he also joked about being a virgin into his 80s. He always maintained his residence in Puerto Rico.

== Decline in health and death ==

In January 2012, Mercado was flown to Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, with cardiac problems. He said he &quot;had gone and seen death and came back to life again&quot;. Since the experience he said he had changed. He said he wanted to work with Puerto Rican youth, he planned to establish the Shanti Ananda foundation, create a mystic center, and donated three of his capes to a museum. Most of his capes had already been sold at auctions.

Mercado died on the night of Saturday, November 2, 2019, at the age of 87, reportedly from kidney failure, at Auxilio Mutuo Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico, according to hospital spokeswoman Sofia Luquis. He is buried at Señorial Memorial Park in Cupey barrio, San Juan, Puerto Rico.

<doc id="82508" wikidata="Q1022117" url="?curid=82508" title="Messene">
<text>Messene (Greek: Μεσσήνη 𐀕𐀼𐀙 &quot;Messini&quot;), officially Ancient Messene, is a local community within the regional unit (&quot;perifereiaki enotita&quot;) of Messenia in the region (&quot;perifereia&quot;) of Peloponnese.

It is best known for the ruins of the large classical city-state of Ancient Messene. The site was founded in the Bronze Age as Ithome, an ancient city originally of Achaean Greeks which eventually came under the hegemony of the military state of Sparta with which it had a long struggle. During the latter period many inhabitants went into exile, and eventually it was destroyed by the Spartans and abandoned for some time.

After the defeat of the Spartans at the Battle of Leuctra (371 BC), the Thebans invaded the Peloponnese and Epaminondas built the new city of Messene on the site in 369 BC over the ruins of Ithome and invited the return of the previous inhabitants and their descendants.

The substantial ruins are a major historical attraction. Much has been archaeologically excavated and partly restored or preserved for study and public viewing, as well as for various events. The most substantial restored remains date from the Hellenistic and Roman times.

The city of Messene flourished also in the postclassical times and a settlement at the site continued until modern times. Late Roman Messene suffered much after the major AD 365 Crete earthquake that hit hard also the entire SW Peloponnese. From the beginning of the 5th century AD Messene is being reconstructed as a Christian city and the seat of a local bishop. It will be in the so called Byzantine &quot;Dark-Ages&quot; during the 7th and 8th centuries that the city once again experienced a deep crisis with the settlement of new populations in the region, probably of Slavic origin. In Middle Byzantine times, after the 10th century, the now called village or township of Voulcano experiences new growth with rich material remains. The village of Voulcano/Messene continues through the Late Medieval/Frankish and Ottoman periods until Early Modern times when the village changes name again into Mavromati, that still occupies what was the upper city around the ancient fountain identified as Klepsydra.

==Geography==

Archaia Messene is located north of Kalamata and east of Pylos.

==Archaeology==

Excavation of the site began on April 10, 1829, with the French scientific commission of the Morea Expedition, under the direction of Guillaume-Abel Blouet, at the end of the Greek War of Independence. 
Systematic excavation of the site was first undertaken by Themistoklis Sofoulis of the Athens Archaeological Society in 1895. Since then a number of noted archaeologists have made contributions, such as George Oikonomos (in 1909 and 1925), Anastasios Orlandos (in 1957), and Petros Themelis (in 1986). A museum of their extensive finds has been constructed within the old city walls.

This site was awarded a European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Award in 2011.

The systematic excavation under the direction of Prof. Petros Themelis has collaborated with many international institutions for excavation at the site. Among those, since 2020-21, excavation East of the temenos of Asclepius at the site of an early Christian church is conducted by the Open University of Cyprus.

==History==
===Bronze Age Messana===

During the Bronze Age the palace at Pylos controlled Messenia politically and economically. A Linear B tablet from there, PY Cn 3, mentions a region called &quot;Mezana&quot; in local Mycenaean Greek (Linear B: , &quot;me-za-na&quot;), from which groups of men named from places in the Peloponnesus each contributed one ox (Linear B: , &quot;qo-o&quot;; also denoted by the BOS ideogram, i.e. ) to an official, possibly a priest in the Zeus-sanctuary, named *&quot;Diwijeus&quot; (Linear B: , &quot;di-wi-je-we&quot; ; the word could be, instead of an anthroponym, an adjective meaning &quot;priest in the Zeus-sanctuary&quot;). These groups were members of the coast-watchers, a military or quasi-military unit that presumably were stationed to guard various locations on the coast. Their failure is attested by the burning of Pylos a few months later by unknown assailants from the sea. The watchers include some Olumpiaioi (Olympians) from Orumanthos (Mt. Erymanthos). John Bennet expressed the opinion that by Mezana is meant Messana, a Mycenaean Greek form of Messene. He supposed that the region around Ithome would already have had that name, to be reutilized by Epaminondas a thousand years later.

===Reconstitution of the city by the Thebans===
After the defeat of the Spartan army at the Battle of Leuctra in Boeotia, 371 BC, the helots of Messenia revolted yet again against their Spartan overlords. This time the victorious general, Epaminondas, entered the Peloponnesus with an army of Boeotians, Argives and Messenians living abroad. Epaminondas resolved to support an independent Peloponnesus by building three fortified cities, Megalopolis and Mantinea in Arcadia and Messene in Messenia.

After all due care to obtain omens from the gods, make sacrifices and invite the spirits of past rulers and heroes to live in Messene, including Queen Messene, Epaminondas invited construction engineers and artisans from anywhere to join him. In 85 days the combined armies and exiles guided by the engineers and artisans had completed the walled city of Messene over the site of the previous Ithome. The city included within its walls Mt. Ithome and enough agricultural land and spring captures to withstand a siege indefinitely. The policy was justified almost immediately. After the departure of the Theban army the Spartans attempted to retake Messenia, which then allied itself with the Macedonians. This time the long struggle with Sparta was brought to a final end by the Macedonian conquest of Greece.

After the departure of the allies, the new city and the fate of Messenian independence were left in the hands of the Messenian exiles, who had returned primarily from Sicily and North Africa. Apparently, they had maintained a transitory community in exile, or diaspora, for some 300 years. They spoke a Doric dialect. Pausanias reports, &quot;even to this day they preserve it in its purity better than anywhere else in the Peloponnese.&quot; As the Arcadians are known to have spoken a dialect closely related to Mycenaean Greek, the exiles restored were not from the original Achaean refugees of the return of the Heracleidae, but were the Doricised population that developed in the 7th century BC under the subsequently dispossessed Heraclid dynasty of Messene.

==The Site==

===City walls===
Messene was surrounded by a circuit wall long, — high. It was fortified by 30 square or horseshoe-shaped guard towers (and probably barracks) with doors admitting passage to a protected walkway on top of the wall. The wall was pierced by two main gates flanked by protective structures and rectangular in shape with a lintel of a single, massive beam of limestone. Through the Arcadia Gate to the north ran and still runs the main road north (to Arcadia), currently from Mavromati. As Mavromati is the location of the major spring capture, klepsydra, it was probably the first stop for travellers to the city. From there a road runs over the ridge adjoining Mounts Ithome and Eva to the Laconia Gate, similar to the Arcadia Gate. The wall runs straight up the ridge but does not encompass Mount Eva. Today the next stop on the road is the monastery, Mone Voulkanou, set into the lower southeast flank of Mounts Eva.

===Public buildings and monuments===
Pausanias has left a description of the city, its chief temples and statues, its springs, its market-place and gymnasium, the Asclepieion, its place of sacrifice, the tomb of the hero Aristomenes and the temple of Zeus Ithomatas on the summit of the acropolis with a statue by the famous Argive sculptor Ageladas, originally made for the Messenian helots who had settled at Naupactus at the close of the third Messenian War.

The other buildings which can be identified are the theatre, the stadium, the council chamber or Bouleuterion, and the &quot;propylaeum&quot; of the market, while on the shoulder of the mountain are the foundations of a small temple, probably that of Artemis Laphria.

===Early Christian and Byzantine monuments===

As Messene continued to be an important urban center of SW Peloponnese all through Late Antiquity, a considerable number of Early Christian and Byzantine monuments have been excavated and are now visible and partially restored. Of special importance is a 3rd and 4th century CE house church that was created inside a luxurious Roman urban house in order to accommodate the needs of the Early Christian community of Messene and serve as a prayer room and assembly hall. This building constitutes one of the very few known early domus ecclesiae buildings. The house church was destroyed in the 365 CE earthquake and abandoned afterwards.

From the sixth century dates a large three-aisled basilica built near the old Theater of the city, at an area where a Christian cemetery had developed.

<text>Ageladas ( &quot;Agelā́dās&quot;) or Hagelaedas ( &quot;Hagelā́idās&quot;) was a celebrated Greek (Argive) sculptor, who flourished in the latter part of the 6th and the early part of the 5th century BC.

Ageladas&#x27; fame is enhanced by his having been the instructor of the three great masters, Phidias, Myron, and Polykleitos. The determination of the period when Ageladas flourished has given rise to a great deal of discussion, owing to the apparently contradictory statements of the writers who mention his name. Pausanias states that Ageladas cast a statue of Cleosthenes (who gained a victory in the chariot-race in the 66th Olympiad) with the chariot, horses, and charioteer placed at Olympia.

Also at Olympia, there were statues by Ageladas of Timasitheus of Delphi and Anochus of Tarentum. Timasitheus was put to death by the Athenians for his participation in the attempt to overthrow the tyrant Isagoras during the 68th Olympiad in 507. According to Eusebius, Anochus was a victor in the games of the 65th Olympiad. Therefore, if Ageladas was born about 540, he may very well have been the instructor of Phidias. On the other hand, Pliny says that Ageladas, with Polykleitos, Phradmon, and Myron, flourished in the 87th Olympiad. This agrees with the statement of the scholiast on Aristophanes, that at Melite there was a statue of Heracles (), the work of Ageladas the Argive, which was set up during the great pestilence at the 87th Olympiad.

To these authorities must be added a passage of Pausanias, where he speaks of a statue of Zeus made by Ageladas for the Messenians of Naupactus. This must have been after the year 455, when the Messenians were allowed by the Athenians to settle at Naupactus.

In order to reconcile these conflicting statements, it has been argued that Pliny&#x27;s date is wrong and that the statue of Heracles had been made by Ageladas long before it was set up at Melite. Other scholars think that Pliny&#x27;s date is correct, but that Ageladas did not make the statues of the Olympic victors mentioned by Pausanias until many years after their victories. Given that the dates of those individuals&#x27; victories are so nearly the same, this could be argued as being a very extraordinary coincidence.

The most probable solution of the difficulty is that proposed by Friedrich Thiersch, who thinks that there were two artists of this name: one an Argive, the instructor of Phidias, born about 540; the other a native of Sicyon, who flourished at the date assigned by Pliny and was confused by the scholiast on Aristophanes with his more illustrious Argive namesake. Thiersch supports this hypothesis by an able criticism of a passage of Pausanias.

Other scholars assume that there were two artists with the name of Ageladas, but both were Argives. Ageladas the Argive executed one of a group of three Muses, representing respectively the presiding geniuses of the diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic styles of Greek music. Canachus and Aristocles of Sicyon made the other two.

He may have been the teacher of the sculptor Ascarus.

<text>Myron of Eleutherae (480–440 BC) (, &quot;Myrōn&quot; ) was an Athenian sculptor from the mid-5th century BC. Alongside three other Greek sculptors, Polykleitos Pheidias, and Praxiteles, Myron is considered as one of the most important sculptors of classical antiquity. He was born in Eleutherae on the borders of Boeotia and Attica. According to &quot;Natural History&quot;, a Latin encyclopedia by Pliny the Elder (AD 23 – 79), a scholar in Ancient Rome, Ageladas of Argos was his teacher.

None of his original sculptures are known to survive, but there are many later copies of his works, such as his &quot;Discobolus&quot;, mostly Roman.

==Reputation==
Myron worked almost exclusively in bronze and his fame rested principally upon his representations of athletes (including his iconic &quot;Diskobolos&quot;), in which he made a revolution, according to commentators in Antiquity, by introducing greater boldness of pose and a more perfect rhythm, subordinating the parts to the whole. Pliny&#x27;s remark that Myron&#x27;s works were &quot;numerosior&quot; than those of Polycleitus and &quot;more diligent&quot; seem to suggest that they were considered more harmonious in proportions (&quot;numeri&quot;) and at the same time more convincing in realism: &quot;diligentia&quot; connoted &quot;attentive care to fine points&quot;, a quality that, in moderation, was characteristic of the best works of art, according to critics in Antiquity.

==Works==
According to Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History,&quot; Myron&#x27;s most famous works included &quot;heifer, a dog (&quot;canem&quot;, Cerberus?), a Perseus, a satyr (Marsyas) admiring the flute and Minerva (Athena), a Hercules, which was taken to the shrine dedicated by Pompey the Great at the Circus Maximus, &quot;Discobolus&quot; (the discus thrower), and an Apollo for Ephesus, &quot;which Antony the triumvir took from the Ephesians, but the deified Augustus restored it again after being warned in a dream&quot;. The Early Imperial Roman writers consistently rated Myron among the greatest of Greek sculptors, a sign that his contemporaneous reputation had remained high. The heifer seems to have earned its fame mainly by serving as a peg on which to hang epigrams, which tell nothing about the pose of the animal.

Chionis, a 7th-century BC Olympic victor from Sparta, was commemorated in an idealized bronze by Myron.

==Attributions==
An epigram on Ladas, the fleetest runner of his time, notes that he was commemorated in a sculpture by Myron; of Myron&#x27;s &quot;Ladas&quot; there is no known copy. A description by Lucian conclusively identifies as Myron&#x27;s the &quot;Discobolus&quot; or &quot;Discus-Thrower&quot;, of which several copies exist, of which the best is in the Palazzo Massimi alle Terme, Rome. Strabo also registers stray comments on Myron, especially a large group at Samos; several surviving heads were identified as copies of Myron&#x27;s &quot;Samian Athena&quot; by C.K. Jenkins in 1926.

A marble figure in the Lateran Museum, which is now restored as a dancing satyr, is almost certainly a copy of a work of Myron, a Marsyas desirous of picking up the aulos which Athena had thrown away. The full group is copied on coins of Athens, on a vase and in a relief which represent Marsyas as oscillating between curiosity and the fear of the displeasure of Athena. The ancient critics say of Myron that while he succeeded admirably in giving life and motion to his figures, he did not succeed in rendering the emotions of the mind. This agrees with the extant evidence, in a certain degree, though not perfectly. The bodies of his men are of far greater excellence than the heads. The face of the Marsyas is almost a mask; but from the attitude we gain a vivid impression of the passions which sway him. The face of the discus-thrower is calm and unruffled; but all the muscles of his body are concentrated in an effort.

A considerable number of other extant works were ascribed to the school or the influence of Myron by Adolf Furtwängler. These attributions have not stood up to the test of time. A papyrus from Oxyrhyncus gives dates of victors at Olympia of whom Myron made statues of the athlete Timanthes, victorious at Olympia in 456 BC, and of Lycinus, victorious in 448 BC and 444 BC. This helps us to fix his date. He was a contemporary, but a somewhat older contemporary, of Pheidias and Polykleitos.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hymen (), Hymenaios or Hymenaeus, is a god of marriage ceremonies who inspires feasts and song. Related to the god&#x27;s name, a &quot;hymenaios&quot; is a genre of Greek lyric poetry that was sung during the procession of the bride to the groom&#x27;s house in which the god is addressed, in contrast to the &quot;Epithalamium&quot;, which is sung at the nuptial threshold. He is one of the winged love gods, the Erotes.

Hymen is the son of Apollo and one of the muses, Clio or Calliope or Urania or Terpsichore.

==Etymology==
Hymen&#x27;s name is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;syuh₁-men&quot;-, &quot;to sew together,&quot; hence, &quot;joiner;&quot; it is also recorded in Doric Greek as Ῡ̔μᾱ́ν (&quot;Hyman&quot;). The term &quot;hymen&quot; was also used for a thin skin or membrane such as that which covers the vaginal opening and was traditionally supposed to be broken by sexual intercourse after a woman&#x27;s (first) marriage. The membrane&#x27;s name was, therefore, not directly connected to that of the god, but they shared the same root and in folk etymology were sometimes supposed to be related.

==Function and representation==
Hymen is supposed to attend every wedding. If he did not, the marriage would supposedly prove disastrous and so the Greeks would run about calling his name aloud. He presided over many of the weddings in Greek mythology, for all the deities and their children.

Hymen is celebrated in the ancient marriage song of unknown origin (called a Hymenaios) &quot;Hymen o Hymenae, Hymen&quot; delivered by G. Valerius Catullus.

==Mythology==
Hymen was mentioned in Euripides&#x27;s &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; in which Cassandra says:
Hymen is also mentioned in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; and in seven plays by William Shakespeare: &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;Much Ado about Nothing&quot;, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;, &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;, where he joins the couples at the end —
Hymen also appears in the work of the 7th- to 6th-century BCE Greek poet Sappho (translation: M. L. West, &quot;Greek Lyric Poetry&quot;, Oxford University Press):
Hymen is most commonly the son of Apollo and one of the Muses. In Seneca&#x27;s play &quot;Medea&quot;, he is stated to be the son of Dionysus.

Other stories give Hymen a legendary origin. In one of the surviving fragments of the &quot;Megalai Ehoiai&quot; attributed to Hesiod, it&#x27;s told that Magnes &quot;had a son of remarkable beauty, Hymenaeus. And when Apollo saw the boy, he was seized with love for him, and wouldn&#x27;t leave the house of Magnes&quot;.

Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;Peace&quot; ends with Trygaeus and the Chorus singing the wedding song, with the repeated phrase &quot;Oh Hymen! Oh Hymenaeus!&quot;, a typical refrain for a wedding song.

According to Athenaeus, Likymnios of Chios, in his &quot;Dithyrambics&quot;, says that Hymenaeus was the &quot;erastes&quot; of Argynnus, a boy from Boeotia.

Maurus Servius Honoratus, in his commentaries on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, mentions that Hesperus, the Evening Star, inhabited Mount Oeta in Thessaly and that there he had loved the young Hymenaeus, son of Apollo with a similar singing voice, which he was said to have lost at the wedding of Dionysus and Ariadne.

===Later story of origin===
According to a later romance, Hymen was an Athenian youth of great beauty but low birth who fell in love with the daughter of one of the city&#x27;s wealthiest women. Since he could not speak to her or court her because of his social standing, he instead followed her wherever she went.

Hymen disguised himself as a woman in order to join one of those processions, a religious rite at Eleusis in which only women went. The assemblage was captured by pirates, Hymen included. He encouraged the women and plotted strategy with them, and together, they killed their captors. He then agreed with the women to go back to Athens and win their freedom if he were allowed to marry one of them. He thus succeeded in both the mission and the marriage, and his marriage was so happy that Athenians instituted festivals in his honour, and he came to be associated with marriage.

According to Apollodorus, &quot;the Orphics report&quot; that Hymenaeus was among those resurrected by Asclepius.

== In popular culture ==

At least since the Italian Renaissance, Hymen was generally represented in art as a young man wearing a garland of flowers and holding a burning torch in one hand.

Hymen appears as a character in the final scene of William Shakespeare&#x27;s pastoral comedy &quot;As You Like It&quot; in which he presides over the rites for four weddings. These include a dance of harmony for the eight characters entering their unions, including the play&#x27;s protagonist and heroine Rosalind with her beloved Orlando.

&quot;Hymen&quot; (1921) is an early book of poetry by the American modernist poet H.D. The eponymous long poem of the collection imagines an ancient Greek women&#x27;s ritual for a bride.

<text>The hymen is a thin piece of mucosal tissue that surrounds or partially covers the vaginal introitus. A small percentage are born with hymens that are imperforate and completely obstruct the vaginal canal. It forms part of the vulva and is similar in structure to the vagina. The term comes straight from the Greek, for &#x27;membrane&#x27;.

In children, a common appearance of the hymen is crescent-shaped, although many shapes are possible. Each shape in the natural range has a Latinate name. During puberty, estrogen causes the hymen to change in appearance and become very elastic. Normal variations of the post-pubertal hymen range from thin and stretchy to thick and somewhat rigid. Very rarely, it may be completely absent.

The hymen can rip or tear during first penetrative intercourse, which usually results in pain and, sometimes, mild temporary bleeding or spotting. Minor injuries to the hymen may heal on their own, and not require surgical intervention. Historically, it was believed that first penetration was necessarily traumatic, but now sources differ on how common tearing or bleeding are as a result of first intercourse. Therefore, the state of the hymen is not a reliable indicator of virginity, though &quot;virginity testing&quot; remains a common practice in some cultures, sometimes accompanied by hymen reconstruction surgery to give the appearance of virginity.

==Development and histology==
The genital tract develops during embryogenesis, from the third week of gestation to the second trimester, and the hymen is formed following the vagina. At week seven, the urorectal septum forms and separates the rectum from the urogenital sinus. At week nine, the Müllerian ducts move downwards to reach the urogenital sinus, forming the uterovaginal canal and inserting into the urogenital sinus. At week twelve, the Müllerian ducts fuse to create a primitive uterovaginal canal called unaleria. At month five, the vaginal canalization is complete and the fetal hymen is formed from the proliferation of the sinovaginal bulbs (where Müllerian ducts meet the urogenital sinus), and normally becomes perforate before or shortly after birth.

The hymen has dense innervation. In newborn babies, still under the influence of the mother&#x27;s hormones, the hymen is thick, pale pink, and redundant (folds in on itself and may protrude). For the first two to four years of life, the infant produces hormones that continue this effect. Their hymenal opening tends to be annular (circumferential).

Post neonatal stage, the diameter of the hymenal opening (measured within the hymenal ring) widens by approximately 1 mm for each year of age. During puberty, estrogen causes the hymen to become very elastic and d.The hymen can stretch or tear as a result of various behaviors, by the use of tampons or menstrual cups, pelvic examinations with a speculum, or sexual intercourse. Remnants of the hymen are called carunculae myrtiformes.

A glass or plastic rod of 6 mm diameter having a globe on one end with varying diameter from 10 to 25 mm, called a Glaister Keen rod, is used for close examination of the hymen or the degree of its rupture. In forensic medicine, it is recommended by health authorities that a physician who must swab near this area of a prepubescent girl avoid the hymen and swab the outer vulval vestibule instead. In cases of suspected rape or child sexual abuse, a detailed examination of the hymen may be performed, but the condition of the hymen alone is often inconclusive.

==Anatomic variations==

Normal variations of the hymen range from thin and stretchy to thick and somewhat rigid. An imperforate hymen occurs in 1-2 out of 1,000 infants. The only variation that may require medical intervention is the imperforate hymen, which either completely prevents the passage of menstrual fluid or slows it significantly. In either case, surgical intervention may be needed to allow menstrual fluid to pass or intercourse to take place at all.

Prepubescent hymenal openings come in many shapes, depending on hormonal and activity level, the most common being crescentic (posterior rim): no tissue at the 12 o&#x27;clock position; crescent-shaped band of tissue from 1–2 to 10–11 o&#x27;clock, at its widest around 6 o&#x27;clock. From puberty onwards, depending on estrogen and activity levels, the hymenal tissue may be thicker, and the opening is often fimbriated or erratically shaped. In younger children, a torn hymen will typically heal very quickly. In adolescents, the hymenal opening can naturally extend and variation in shape and appearance increases.

Variations of the female reproductive tract can result from agenesis or hypoplasia, canalization defects, lateral fusion and failure of resorption, resulting in various complications.
* Imperforate: hymenal opening nonexistent; will require minor surgery if it has not corrected itself by puberty to allow menstrual fluids to escape.
* Cribriform, or microperforate: sometimes confused for imperforate, the hymenal opening appears to be nonexistent, but has, under close examination, small perforations.
* Septate: the hymenal opening has one or more bands of tissue extending across the opening.
* Tight hymenal ring: the hymen is rigid and the introitus tight. 

== Trauma ==
Historically, it was believed that first sexual intercourse was necessarily traumatic to the hymen and always resulted in the hymen being &quot;broken&quot; or torn, causing bleeding. However, research on women in Western populations has found that bleeding during first intercourse does not invariably occur. In one cross-cultural study, slightly more than half of all women self-reported bleeding during first intercourse, with significantly different levels of pain and bleeding reported depending on their region of origin. Not all women experience pain, and one study found a correlation between the experience of strong emotions – such as excitement, nervousness, or fear – with experiencing pain during first intercourse.

In several studies of adolescent female rape victims, where patients were examined at a hospital following sexual assault, half or fewer of virgin victims had any injury to the hymen. Tears of the hymen occurred in less than a quarter of cases. However, virgins were significantly more likely to have injuries to the hymen than non-virgins.

In a study of adolescents who had previously had consensual sex, approximately half showed evidence of trauma to the hymen. Trauma to the hymen may also occur in adult non-virgins following consensual sex, although it is rare. Trauma to the hymen may heal without any visible sign of injury. An observational study of adolescent sexual assault victims found that majority of wounds to the hymen healed without any visible sign of injury having occurred.

Trauma to the hymen is hypothesized to occur as a result of various other behaviors, such as tampon or menstrual cup use, pelvic examinations with a speculum, masturbation, gymnastics, or horseback riding, although the true prevalence of trauma as a result of these activities is unclear.

==Cultural and religious significance==

The hymen is often attributed important cultural significance in certain communities because of its association with a woman&#x27;s virginity. In those cultures, an intact hymen is highly valued at marriage in the belief that this is a proof of virginity. Some women undergo hymenorrhaphy to restore their hymen for this reason. In October 2018, the UN Human Rights Council, UN Women and the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that virginity testing must end as &quot;it is a painful, humiliating and traumatic practice, constituting violence against women&quot;.

Some traditional Christian theological interpretations state that it is intended by God for the husband to be the one to break his wife&#x27;s hymen, and that the bleeding the hymen, believed occur during first intercourse (but see above), is a blood covenant that seals the bond of holy matrimony between husband and wife (cf. &quot;consummation&quot;).

==Womb fury==
In the 16th and 17th centuries, medical researchers mistakenly saw the presence or absence of the hymen as founding evidence of physical diseases such as &quot;womb-fury&quot;, i.e., (female) hysteria. If not cured, womb-fury would, according to doctors practicing at the time, result in death.
==Other animals==
Due to similar reproductive system development, many mammals have hymens, including chimpanzees, elephants, manatees, whales, horses and llamas.

<text>Agoracritus ( &quot;Agorákritos&quot;; fl. late 5th century BC) was a famous sculptor in ancient Greece.

==Life==
Agoracritus was born on the island of Paros, and was active from about Olympiad 85 to 88, that is, from about 436 to 424 BC. He was a pupil of the sculptor Phidias.

Only four of Agoracritus&#x27; works are mentioned: a statue of Zeus and one of Athena Itonia in the temple of that goddess at Athens; a statue, probably of Cybele, in the temple of the Great Goddess at Athens; and the Rhamnusian Nemesis. Respecting this last work there has been a great deal of discussion. The account which Pliny gives of it is that Agoracritus contended with Alcamenes (another distinguished disciple of Phidias) in making a statue of Venus; and that the Athenians, through an undue partiality towards their countryman, awarded the victory to Alcamenes. Agoracritus, indignant at his defeat, made some slight alterations so as to change his Venus into a Nemesis (the goddess of retribution or revenge), and sold it to the people of Rhamnus on the condition that it should never be set up in Athens.

Pausanias, without saying a word about Agoracritus, says that the Rhamnusian Nemesis was the work of Phidias, and was made out of the block of Parian marble, which the Persians under Datis and Artaphernes brought with them for the purpose of setting up a trophy. This account however has been overwhelmingly rejected as involving a confusion of the ideas connected by the Greeks with the goddess Nemesis. The statue moreover was not of Parian, but of Pentelic marble. Strabo, John Tzetzes, the Suda and Photius give other variations in speaking of this statue. It seems generally agreed that Pliny&#x27;s account of the matter is correct in most of the particulars; and there have been various dissertations on the way in which a statue of Venus could have been changed into one of Nemesis.

As late as the early 20th century, parts of the statue&#x27;s head were in the British Museum; some fragments of the reliefs which adorned the pedestal were in the museum at Athens. By the beginning of the 21st century, enough fragments had been recovered (including the base) that a partial reconstruction of Agoracritus&#x27; Nemesis was performed in Rhamnus. In it, Nemesis is depicted holding an apple branch and a phiale, wearing a crown decorated with deer. The base depicts Leda showing Helen to Tyndareus.

Agoracritus is also a character (the sausage seller) in Greek playwright Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;The Knights&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, dreams were sometimes personified as Oneiros () or Oneiroi (). In the &quot;Iliad&quot; of Homer, Zeus sends an Oneiros to appear to Agamemnon in a dream, while in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, the Oneiroi are the sons of Nyx (Night), and brothers of Hypnos (Sleep).

Oneiros was also, according to one Greek Grammarian named Photius, the name of one of the sons of Achilles with Deidamia.

==Sources==
For the ancient Greeks, dreams were not generally personified. However, a few instances of the personification of dreams, some perhaps solely poetic, can be found in ancient Greek sources.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, Zeus decides to send a &quot;baleful dream&quot; to Agamemnon, the commander of the Greek army during the Trojan War. An Oneiros is summoned by Zeus, and ordered to go to the camp of the Greeks at Troy and deliver a message from Zeus urging him to battle. The Oneiros goes quickly to Agamemnon&#x27;s tent, and finding him asleep, stands above Agamemnon&#x27;s head; taking the shape of Nestor, a trusted counselor to Agamemnon, the Oneiros speaks to Agamemnon, as Zeus had instructed him.

The &quot;Odyssey&quot; locates a &quot;land of dreams&quot; past the streams of Oceanus, close to Asphodel Meadows, where the spirits of the dead reside. In another passage of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, truthful dreams are said to come through a gate made of horn, while deceitful dreams come through a gate made of ivory (see Gates of horn and ivory).

Hesiod in his genealogical poem the &quot;Theogony&quot;, makes the &quot;tribe of Dreams&quot; (&quot;φῦλον Ὀνείρων&quot;), among the many offspring of Nyx (Night), without a father. Their siblings include: Moros (Doom), Ker (Destiny), Thanatos (Death), Hypnos (Sleep), Momus (Blame), Oizys (Pain), Keres (Destinies), Nemesis (Retribution), Eris (Discord), and other abstract personifications.

Euripides, in his play &quot;Hecuba&quot; has Hecuba call &quot;lady Earth&quot; the &quot;mother of black-winged dreams&quot;. The second-century AD geographer Pausanias mentions seeing statues of an Oneiros and Hypnos lulling a lion to sleep. He writes that the statue was surnamed Epidotes.

==Related figures==
Related figures are the &quot;Somnia&quot; (Dreams), the thousand sons that the Latin poet Ovid gave to Somnus (Sleep), who appear in dreams. Ovid named three of the sons of Somnus: Morpheus, who appears in human guise, Phobetor, called Icelos by the gods, who appears as beasts, and Phantasos, who appears as inanimate objects.

==Son of Achilles==
Oneiros was also, according to some myths, the name of one of the sons of Achilles with Deidamia. His brother was Neoptolemus. He was killed by Orestes, who didn&#x27;t recognize him, while fighting with him in Phocis for a place to pitch a tent.

<text>Polygnotus (; &quot;Polygnotos&quot;) was an ancient Greek painter from the middle of the 5th century BC. 
==Life==
He was the son and pupil of Aglaophon. He was a native of Thasos, but was adopted by the Athenians, and admitted to their citizenship.


During the time of Cimon, Polygnotus painted for the Athenians a picture of the taking of Troy on the walls of the Stoa Poikile, and another of the marriage of the daughters of Leucippus in the Anacaeum. Plutarch mentions historians and the poet Melanthius attest that Polygnotus did not paint for the money, but rather out of a charitable feeling towards the Athenian people. In the hall at the entrance to the Acropolis other works of his were preserved. The most important of his paintings were his frescoes in the Lesche of the Knidians, a building erected at Delphi by the people of Cnidus. The subjects of these were the visit to Hades by Odysseus and the taking of Troy.

The traveller Pausanias recorded a careful description of these paintings, figure by figure. The foundations of the building have been recovered in the course of the French excavations at Delphi. From this evidence, some archaeologists have tried to reconstruct the paintings, other than their colours. The figures were detached and rarely overlapping, ranged in two or three rows one above another, and the further were not smaller nor dimmer than the nearer. Therefore, it seems that the paintings of this time were executed on almost precisely the same plan as contemporary sculptural reliefs.

Polygnotus employed only a few simple colours. Technically his art was primitive. His excellence lay in the beauty of his drawing of individual figures, especially in the &quot;ethical&quot; and ideal character of his art. A contemporary and teacher of Pheidias, Polygnotus had the same grand manner. Simplicity, which was almost childlike, sentiment at once noble and gentle, extreme grace and charm of execution, marked his works, in contrast to the more animated, complicated and technically superior paintings of later ages.

According to Ovid, two of his brothers were Morpheus, who appeared in dreams in human form, and Phantasos (&#x27;Fantasy&#x27;), who appears in dreams in the form of inanimate objects. The three brothers‘ names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, which leads some scholars to believe that they were originally invented by him. One example of these scholars is Tripp, who calls the three figures &quot;literary, not mythical concepts&quot;. However, there is not a consensus around the origins of the figures. For example, Griffin suggests that the names of the deities and the division of dream forms between Phobetor and his brothers may have been of Hellenistic origin.

<doc id="82533" wikidata="Q166542" url="?curid=82533" title="International relations">
<text>International relations (IR, and also referred to as international studies, international politics, or international affairs) is an academic discipline. In a broader sense, the study of IR, in addition to multilateral relations, concerns all activities among states—such as war, diplomacy, trade, and foreign policy—as well as relations with and among other international actors, such as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), international legal bodies, and multinational corporations (MNCs).

International relations is generally classified as a major multidiscipline of political science, along with comparative politics, political methodology, political theory, and public administration. It often draws heavily from other fields, including anthropology, economics, geography, history, law, philosophy, and sociology. There are several schools of thought within IR, of which the most prominent are realism, liberalism, and constructivism. 

While international politics has been analyzed since antiquity, it did not become a discrete field until 1919, when it was first offered as an undergraduate major by Aberystwyth University in the United Kingdom. The Second World War and its aftermath provoked greater interest and scholarship in international relations, particularly in North America and Western Europe, where it was shaped considerably by the geostrategic concerns of the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent rise of globalization in the late 20th century have presaged new theories and evaluations of the rapidly changing international system.

==Terminology==
Depending on the academic institution, &quot;international relations&quot; or &quot;international affairs&quot; is either a subdiscipline of political science or a broader multidisciplinary field encompassing global politics, law, economics or world history. As a subdiscipline of political science, the focus of IR studies lies on political, diplomatic and security connections among states, as well as the study of modern political world history. In many academic institutions, studies of IR are thus situated in the department of politics/social sciences. This is for example the case in Scandinavia, where international relations are often simply referred to as &quot;international politics (IP).&quot;

In institutions where &quot;international relations&quot; refers to the broader multidisciplinary field of global politics, law, economics and history, the subject may be studied across multiple departments, or be situated in its own department, as is the case at for example the London School of Economics. An undergraduate degree in multidisciplinary international relations may lead to a more specialised master&#x27;s degree of either international politics, economics, or international law.

In the inaugural issue of &quot;World Politics&quot;, Frederick S. Dunn wrote that IR was about &quot;relations that take place across national boundaries&quot; and &quot;between autonomous political groups in a world system&quot;. Dunn wrote that unique elements characterized IR and separated it from other subfields:international politics is concerned with the special kind of power relationships that exist in a community lacking an overriding authority; international economics deals with trade relations across national boundaries that are complicated by the uncontrolled actions of sovereign states; and international law is law that is based on voluntary acceptance by independent nations.The terms &quot;International studies&quot; and &quot;global studies&quot; have been used by some to refer to a broader multidisciplinary IR field.

==History of international relations==
Studies of international relations started thousands of years ago; Barry Buzan and Richard Little considered the interaction of ancient Sumerian city-states, starting in 3,500 BC, as the first fully-fledged international system. Analyses of the foreign policies of sovereign city states have been done in ancient times, as in Thycydides&#x27; analysis of the causes of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, as well as by Niccolò Machiavelli in &quot;The Prince,&quot; published in 1532, where he analyzed the foreign policy of the renaissance city state of Florence. The contemporary field of international relations, however, analyzes the connections existing between sovereign nation-states. This makes the establishment of the modern state system the natural starting point of international relations history.

The establishment of modern sovereign states as fundamental political units traces back to the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 in Europe. During the preceding Middle Ages, European organization of political authority was based on a vaguely hierarchical religious order. Contrary to popular belief, Westphalia still embodied layered systems of sovereignty, especially within the Holy Roman Empire. More than the Peace of Westphalia, the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713 is thought to reflect an emerging norm that sovereigns had no internal equals within a defined territory and no external superiors as the ultimate authority within the territory&#x27;s sovereign borders. These principles underpin the modern international legal and political order.

The period between roughly 1500 to 1789 saw the rise of independent sovereign states, multilateralism, and the institutionalization of diplomacy and the military. The French Revolution contributed the idea that it was the citizenry of a state, defined as the nation, that were sovereign, rather than a monarch or noble class. A state wherein the nation is sovereign would thence be termed a nation-state, as opposed to a monarchy or a religious state; the term republic increasingly became its synonym. An alternative model of the nation-state was developed in reaction to the French republican concept by the Germans and others, who instead of giving the citizenry sovereignty, kept the princes and nobility, but defined nation-statehood in ethnic-linguistic terms, establishing the rarely if ever fulfilled ideal that all people speaking one language should belong to one state only. The same claim to sovereignty was made for both forms of nation-state. In Europe today, few states conform to either definition of nation-state: many continue to have royal sovereigns, and hardly any are ethnically homogeneous.

The particular European system supposing the sovereign equality of states was exported to the Americas, Africa, and Asia via colonialism and the &quot;standards of civilization&quot;. The contemporary international system was finally established through decolonization during the Cold War. However, this is somewhat over-simplified. While the nation-state system is considered &quot;modern&quot;, many states have not incorporated the system and are termed &quot;pre-modern&quot;.

A handful of states have moved beyond insistence on full sovereignty, and can be considered &quot;post-modern&quot;. The ability of contemporary IR discourse to explain the relations of these different types of states is disputed. &quot;Levels of analysis&quot; is a way of looking at the international system, which includes the individual level, the domestic state as a unit, the international level of transnational and intergovernmental affairs, and the global level.

What is explicitly recognized as international relations theory was not developed until after World War I, and is dealt with in more detail below. IR theory, however, has a long tradition of drawing on the work of other social sciences. The use of capitalizations of the &quot;I&quot; and &quot;R&quot; in international relations aims to distinguish the academic discipline of international relations from the phenomena of international relations. Many cite Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; (6th century BC), Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot; (5th century BC), Chanakya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; (4th century BC), as the inspiration for realist theory, with Hobbes&#x27; &quot;Leviathan&quot; and Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;The Prince&quot; providing further elaboration.

Similarly, liberalism draws upon the work of Kant and Rousseau, with the work of the former often being cited as the first elaboration of democratic peace theory. Though contemporary human rights is considerably different from the type of rights envisioned under natural law, Francisco de Vitoria, Hugo Grotius, and John Locke offered the first accounts of universal entitlement to certain rights on the basis of common humanity. In the 20th century, in addition to contemporary theories of liberal internationalism, Marxism has been a foundation of international relations.

===Emergence as academic discipline===
International relations as a distinct field of study began in Britain. IR emerged as a formal academic discipline in 1919 with the founding of the first IR professorship: the Woodrow Wilson Chair at Aberystwyth, University of Wales (now Aberystwyth University), held by Alfred Eckhard Zimmern and endowed by David Davies. International politics courses were established at the University of Wisconsin in 1899 by Paul Samuel Reinsch and at Columbia University in 1910. By 1920, there were four universities that taught courses on international organization.

Georgetown University&#x27;s Walsh School of Foreign Service is the oldest continuously operating school for international affairs in the United States, founded in 1919. In 1927, the London School of Economics&#x27; department of international relations was founded at the behest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Philip Noel-Baker: this was the first institute to offer a wide range of degrees in the field. That same year, the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, a school dedicated to teaching international affairs, was founded in Geneva, Switzerland. This was rapidly followed by establishment of IR at universities in the US. The creation of the posts of Montague Burton Professor of International Relations at LSE and at Oxford gave further impetus to the academic study of international relations. Furthermore, the International History department at LSE developed a focus on the history of IR in the early modern, colonial, and Cold War periods.

The first university entirely dedicated to the study of IR was the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, which was founded in 1927 to form diplomats associated to the League of Nations. In 1922, Georgetown University graduated its first class of the Master of Science in Foreign Service (MSFS) degree, making it the first international relations graduate program in the United States. This was soon followed by the establishment of the Committee on International Relations (CIR) at the University of Chicago, where the first research graduate degree was conferred in 1928. The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, a collaboration between Tufts University and Harvard University, opened its doors in 1933 as the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States. In 1965, Glendon College and the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs were the first institutions in Canada to offer an undergraduate and a graduate program in international studies and affairs, respectively.

The lines between IR and other political science subfields is sometimes blurred, in particular when it comes to the study of conflict, institutions, political economy and political behavior. The division between comparative politics and international relations is artificial, as processes within nations shape international processes, and international processes shape processes within states. Some scholars have called for an integration of the fields. Comparative politics does not have similar &quot;isms&quot; as international relations scholarship.

Critical scholarship in international relations has explored the relationship between the institutionalization of IR as an academic discipline and the demands of national governments. &#x27;s book &quot;White World Order, Black Power Politics&quot; details the historical imbrication of IR in the projects of colonial administration and imperialism, while other scholars have traced the emergence of international relations in relation to the consolidation of newly independent nation-states within the non-West, such as Brazil and India.

==Theory==

Within the study of international relations, there exists multiple theories seeking to explain how states and other actors operate within the international system. These can generally be divided into three main strands: realism, liberalism, and constructivism.

===Realism===
The realist framework of international relations rests on the fundamental assumption that the international state system is an anarchy, with no overarching power restricting the behaviour of sovereign states. As a consequence, states are engaged in a continuous power struggle, where they seek to augment their own military capabilities, economic power, and diplomacy relative to other states; this in order to ensure the protection of their political system, citizens, and vital interests. The realist framework further assumes that states act as unitary, rational actors, where central decision makers in the state apparatus ultimately stand for most of the state&#x27;s foreign policy decisions. International organizations are in consequence merely seen as tools for individual states used to further their own interests, and are thought to have little power in shaping states&#x27; foreign policies on their own.

The realist framework is traditionally associated with the analysis of power politics, and has been used to analyze the conflicts between states in the early European state system; the causes of the First and Second World Wars, as well as the behavior of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. In settings such as these, the realist framework carries great interpretative insights in explaining how the military and economic power struggles of states lead to larger armed conflicts.

====History of realism====
&quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, written by Thucydides, is considered a foundational text of the realist school of political philosophy. There is debate over whether Thucydides himself was a realist; Richard Ned Lebow has argued that seeing Thucydides as a realist is a misinterpretation of a more complex political message within his work. Amongst others, philosophers like Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau are considered to have contributed to the realist philosophy. However, while their work may support realist doctrine, it is not likely that they would have classified themselves as realists in this sense. Political realism believes that politics, like society, is governed by objective laws with roots in human nature. To improve society, it is first necessary to understand the laws by which society lives. The operation of these laws being impervious to our preferences, persons will challenge them only at the risk of failure. Realism, believing as it does in the objectivity of the laws of politics, must also believe in the possibility of developing a rational theory that reflects, however imperfectly and one-sidedly, these objective laws. It believes also, then, in the possibility of distinguishing in politics between truth and opinion—between what is true objectively and rationally, supported by evidence and illuminated by reason, and what is only a subjective judgment, divorced from the facts as they are and informed by prejudice and wishful thinking.

Major theorists include E. H. Carr, Robert Gilpin, Charles P. Kindleberger, Stephen D. Krasner, Hans Morgenthau, Kenneth Waltz, Robert Jervis, Stephen Walt, and John Mearsheimer.

===Liberalism===

In contrast to realism, the liberal framework emphasises that states, although they are sovereign, do not exist in a purely anarchical system. Rather, liberal theory assumes that states are institutionally constrained by the power of international organisations, and mutually dependent on one another through economic and diplomatic ties. Institutions such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and the International Court of Justice are taken to, over time, have developed power and influence to shape the foreign policies of individual states. Furthermore, the existence of the globalised world economy makes continuous military power struggle irrational, as states are dependent on participation in the global trade system to ensure their own survival. As such, the liberal framework stresses cooperation between states as a fundamental part of the international system. States are not seen as unitary actors, but pluralistic arenas where interest groups, non-governmental organisations, and economic actors also shape the creation of foreign policy.

The liberal framework is associated with analysis of the globalised world as it emerged in the aftermath of World War II. Increased political cooperation through organisations such as the UN, as well as economic cooperation through institutions such as the WTO, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, was thought to have made the realist analysis of power and conflict inadequate in explaining the workings of the international system.

====History of liberalism====
The intellectual basis of liberal theory is often cited as Immanuel Kant&#x27;s essay &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; from 1795. In it, he postulates that states, over time, through increased political and economic cooperation, will come to resemble an international federation—a world government; which will be characterised by continual peace and cooperation. In modern times, liberal international relations theory arose after World War I in response to the ability of states to control and limit war in their international relations. Early adherents include Woodrow Wilson and Norman Angell, who argued that states mutually gained from cooperation and that war was so destructive as to be essentially futile. Liberalism was not recognized as a coherent theory as such until it was collectively and derisively termed idealism by E. H. Carr. A new version of &quot;idealism&quot; that focused on human rights as the basis of the legitimacy of international law was advanced by Hans Köchler.

Major theorists include Montesquieu, Immanuel Kant, Michael W. Doyle, Francis Fukuyama, and Helen Milner.

====Liberal institutionalism====

Liberal institutionalism (some times referred to as neoliberalism) shows how cooperation can be achieved in international relations even if neorealist assumptions apply (states are the key actors in world politics, the international system is anarchic, and states pursue their self interest). Liberal institutionalists highlight the role of international institutions and regimes in facilitating cooperation between states.

Prominent neoliberal institutionalists are John Ikenberry, Robert Keohane, and Joseph Nye. Robert Keohane&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;After Hegemony&quot; used insights from the new institutional economics to argue that the international system could remain stable in the absence of a hegemon, thus rebutting hegemonic stability theory.

=====Regime theory=====
Regime theory is derived from the liberal tradition that argues that international institutions or regimes affect the behaviour of states (or other international actors). It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, indeed, regimes are by definition, instances of international cooperation.

While realism predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights and collective security among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition of regimes comes from Stephen Krasner, who defines regimes as &quot;principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given issue-area&quot;.

Not all approaches to regime theory, however, are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like Joseph Grieco have developed hybrid theories which take a realist based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation &quot;never&quot; happens, just that it is not the norm; it is a difference of degree).

===Constructivism===
The constructivist framework rests on the fundamental assumption that the international system is built on social constructs; such as ideas, norms, and identities. Various political actors, such as state leaders, policy makers, and the leaders of international organisations, are socialised into different roles and systems of norms, which define how the international system operates. The constructivist scholar Alexander Wendt, in a 1992 article in &quot;International Organization,&quot; noted in response to realism that &quot;anarchy is what states make of it&quot;. By this he means that the anarchic structure that realists claim governs state interaction is in fact a phenomenon that is socially constructed and reproduced by states.

Constructivism is part of critical theory, and as such seeks to criticise the assumptions underlying traditional IR theory. Constructivist theory would for example claim that the state leaders of the United States and Soviet Union were socialised into different roles and norms, which can provide theoretical insights to how the conflict between the nations was conducted during the Cold War. E.g., prominent US policy makers frequently spoke of the USSR as an &#x27;evil empire&#x27;, and thus socialised the US population and state apparatus into an anti-communist sentiment, which defined the norms conducted in US foreign policy. Other constructivist analyses include the discourses on European integration; senior policy-making circles were socialised into ideas of Europe as an historical and cultural community, and therefore sought to construct institutions to integrate European nations into a single political body. Constructivism is also present in the analysis of international law, where norms of conduct such as the prohibition of chemical weapons, torture, and the protection of civilians in war, are socialised into international organisations, and stipulated into rules.

Prominent constructivist IR scholars include Michael Barnett, Martha Finnemore, Ted Hopf, Peter Katzenstein, Kathryn Sikkink, and Alexander Wendt.

===Critical theory (post-structuralism)===
Post-structuralism theories of international relations (also called &quot;critical theories&quot; due to being inherently critical of traditional IR frameworks) developed in the 1980s from postmodernist studies in political science. Post-structuralism explores the deconstruction of concepts traditionally not problematic in IR (such as &quot;power&quot; and &quot;agency&quot;) and examines how the construction of these concepts shapes international relations. The examination of &quot;narratives&quot; plays an important part in poststructuralist analysis; for example, feminist poststructuralist work has examined the role that &quot;women&quot; play in global society and how they are constructed in war as &quot;innocent&quot; and &quot;civilians&quot;. Rosenberg&#x27;s article &quot;Why is there no International Historical Sociology&quot; was a key text in the evolution of this strand of international relations theory. Post-structuralism has garnered both significant praise and criticism, with its critics arguing that post-structuralist research often fails to address the real-world problems that international relations studies is supposed to contribute to solving. Constructivist theory (see above) is the most prominent strand of post-structuralism. Other prominent post-structuralist theories are Marxism, dependency theory, feminism, and the theories of the English school. See also &quot;Critical international relations theory.&quot;

====Marxism====
Marxist theories of IR reject the realist/liberal view of state conflict or cooperation; instead focusing on the economic and material aspects. It makes the assumption that the economy trumps other concerns, making economic class the fundamental level of analysis. Marxists view the international system as an integrated capitalist system in pursuit of capital accumulation. Thus, colonialism brought in sources for raw materials and captive markets for exports, while decolonialization brought new opportunities in the form of dependence.

A prominent derivative of Marxian thought is critical international relations theory which is the application of &quot;critical theory&quot; to international relations. Early critical theorists were associated with the Frankfurt School, which followed Marx&#x27;s concern with the conditions that allow for social change and the establishment of rational institutions. Their emphasis on the &quot;critical&quot; component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of positivism. Modern-day proponents such as Andrew Linklater, Robert W. Cox, and Ken Booth focus on the need for human emancipation from the nation-state. Hence, it is &quot;critical&quot; of mainstream IR theories that tend to be both positivist and state-centric.

=====Dependency theory=====
Further linked in with Marxist theories is dependency theory and the core–periphery model, which argue that developed countries, in their pursuit of power, appropriate developing states through international banking, security and trade agreements and unions on a formal level, and do so through the interaction of political and financial advisors, missionaries, relief aid workers, and MNCs on the informal level, in order to integrate them into the capitalist system, strategically appropriating undervalued natural resources and labor hours and fostering economic and political dependence.

====Feminism====
Feminist IR considers the ways that international politics affects and is affected by both men and women and also at how the core concepts that are employed within the discipline of IR (e.g. war, security, etc.) are themselves gendered. Feminist IR has not only concerned itself with the traditional focus of IR on states, wars, diplomacy and security, but feminist IR scholars have also emphasized the importance of looking at how gender shapes the current global political economy. In this sense, there is no clear cut division between feminists working in IR and those working in the area of International Political Economy (IPE). From its inception, feminist IR has also theorized extensively about men and, in particular, masculinities. Many IR feminists argue that the discipline is inherently masculine in nature. For example, in her article &quot;Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals&quot; Signs (1988), Carol Cohn claimed that a highly masculinized culture within the defense establishment contributed to the divorcing of war from human emotion.

Feminist IR emerged largely from the late 1980s onward. The end of the Cold War and the re-evaluation of traditional IR theory during the 1990s opened up a space for gendering International Relations. Because feminist IR is linked broadly to the critical project in IR, by and large most feminist scholarship have sought to problematize the politics of knowledge construction within the discipline—often by adopting methodologies of deconstructivism associated with postmodernism/poststructuralism. However, the growing influence of feminist and women-centric approaches within the international policy communities (for example at the World Bank and the United Nations) is more reflective of the liberal feminist emphasis on equality of opportunity for women.

Prominent scholars include Carol Cohn, Cynthia Enloe, Sara Ruddick, and J. Ann Tickner.

====International society theory (the English school)====
International society theory, also called the English school, focuses on the shared norms and values of states and how they regulate international relations. Examples of such norms include diplomacy, order, and international law. Theorists have focused particularly on humanitarian intervention, and are subdivided between solidarists, who tend to advocate it more, and pluralists, who place greater value in order and sovereignty. Nicholas Wheeler is a prominent solidarist, while Hedley Bull and Robert H. Jackson are perhaps the best known pluralists. Some English school theoreticians have used historical cases in order to show the influence that normative frameworks have on the evolution of the international political order at various critical junctures.

==Levels of analysis==

===Systemic level concepts===
International relations are often viewed in terms of &quot;levels of analysis&quot;. The &quot;systemic level&quot; concepts are those broad concepts that define and shape an international milieu, characterized by anarchy. Focusing on the systemic level of international relations is often, but not always, the preferred method for neo-realists and other structuralist IR analysts.

====Sovereignty====
Preceding the concepts of interdependence and dependence, international relations relies on the idea of sovereignty. Described in Jean Bodin&#x27;s &quot;Six Books of the Commonwealth&quot; in 1576, the three pivotal points derived from the book describe sovereignty as being a state, that the sovereign power(s) have absolute power over their territories, and that such a power is only limited by the sovereign&#x27;s &quot;own obligations towards other sovereigns and individuals&quot;. Such a foundation of sovereignty is indicated by a sovereign&#x27;s obligation to other sovereigns, interdependence and dependence to take place. While throughout world history there have been instances of groups lacking or losing sovereignty, such as African nations prior to decolonization or the occupation of Iraq during the Iraq War, there is still a need for sovereignty in terms of assessing international relations.

====Power====
The concept of power in international relations can be described as the degree of resources, capabilities, and influence in international affairs. It is often divided up into the concepts of hard power and soft power, hard power relating primarily to coercive power, such as the use of force, and soft power commonly covering economics, diplomacy, and cultural influence. However, there is no clear dividing line between the two forms of power.

====National interest====
Perhaps the most significant concept behind that of power and sovereignty, national interest is a state&#x27;s action in relation to other states where it seeks to gain advantage or benefits to itself. National interest, whether aspirational or operational, is divided by core/vital and peripheral/non-vital interests. Core or vital interests constitute the things which a country is willing to defend or expand with conflict such as territory, ideology (religious, political, economic), or its citizens. Peripheral or non-vital are interests which a state is willing to compromise. For example, in Germany&#x27;s annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938 (a part of Czechoslovakia) under the Munich Agreement, Czechoslovakia was willing to relinquish territory which was considered ethnically German in order to preserve its own integrity and sovereignty.

====Non-state actors====
In the 21st century, the status-quo of the international system is no longer monopolized by states alone. Rather, it is the presence of non-state actors, who autonomously act to implement unpredictable behaviour to the international system. Whether it is transnational corporations, liberation movements, non-governmental agencies, or international organizations, these entities have the potential to significantly influence the outcome of any international transaction. Additionally, this also includes the individual person as while the individual is what constitutes the states collective entity, the individual does have the potential to also create unpredicted behaviours. Al-Qaeda, as an example of a non-state actor, has significantly influenced the way states (and non-state actors) conduct international affairs.

====Power blocs====
The existence of power blocs in international relations is a significant factor related to polarity. During the Cold War, the alignment of several nations to one side or another based on ideological differences or national interests has become an endemic feature of international relations. Unlike prior, shorter-term blocs, the Western and Eastern Blocs sought to spread their national ideological differences to other nations. Leaders like US President Harry S. Truman under the Truman Doctrine believed it was necessary to spread democracy whereas the Warsaw Pact under Soviet policy sought to spread communism. After the Cold War, and the dissolution of the ideologically homogeneous Eastern Bloc still gave rise to others such as the South-South Cooperation movement.

====Polarity====
Polarity in international relations refers to the arrangement of power within the international system. The concept arose from bipolarity during the Cold War, with the international system dominated by the conflict between two superpowers, and has been applied retrospectively by theorists. However, the term bipolar was notably used by Stalin who said he saw the international system as a bipolar one with two opposing power bases and ideologies. Consequently, the international system prior to 1945 can be described as multipolar, with power being shared among great powers.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 had led to unipolarity, with the United States as a sole superpower, although many refuse to acknowledge the fact. China&#x27;s continued rapid economic growth—it became the world&#x27;s second-largest economy in 2010—respectable international position, and the power the Chinese government exerts over its people (consisting of the second largest population in the world), resulted in debate over whether China is now a superpower or a possible candidate in the future. However, China&#x27;s strategic force unable of projecting power beyond its region and its nuclear arsenal of 250 warheads (compared to 7,315+ of the United States) mean that the unipolarity will persist in the policy-relevant future.

Several theories of international relations draw upon the idea of polarity. The balance of power was a concept prevalent in Europe prior to the First World War, the thought being that by balancing power blocs it would create stability and prevent war. Theories of the balance of power gained prominence again during the Cold War, being a central mechanism of Kenneth Waltz&#x27;s neorealism. Here, the concepts of balancing (rising in power to counter another) and bandwagonning (siding with another) are developed.

Robert Gilpin&#x27;s hegemonic stability theory also draws upon the idea of polarity, specifically the state of unipolarity. Hegemony is the preponderance of power at one pole in the international system, and the theory argues this is a stable configuration because of mutual gains by both the dominant power and others in the international system. This is contrary to many neorealist arguments, particularly made by Waltz, stating that the end of the Cold War and the state of unipolarity is an unstable configuration that will inevitably change.

The case of Gilpin proved to be correct and Waltz&#x27;s article titled &quot;The Stability of a Bipolar World&quot; was followed in 1999 by William Wohlforth&#x27;s article titled &quot;The Stability of a Unipolar World&quot;.

Waltz&#x27;s thesis can be expressed in power transition theory, which states that it is likely that a great power would challenge a hegemon after a certain period, resulting in a major war. It suggests that while hegemony can control the occurrence of wars, it also results in the creation of one. Its main proponent, A. F. K. Organski, argued this based on the occurrence of previous wars during British, Portuguese, and Dutch hegemony.

====Interdependence====
Many advocate that the current international system is characterized by growing interdependence; the mutual responsibility and dependency on others. Advocates of this point to growing globalization, particularly with international economic interaction. The role of international institutions, and widespread acceptance of a number of operating principles in the international system, reinforces ideas that relations are characterized by interdependence.

====Dependency====

Dependency theory is a theory most commonly associated with Marxism, stating that a set of core states exploit a set of weaker periphery states for their prosperity. Various versions of the theory suggest that this is either an inevitability (standard dependency theory), or use the theory to highlight the necessity for change (Neo-Marxist).

====Systemic tools of international relations====
* Diplomacy is the practice of communication and negotiation between representatives of states. To some extent, all other tools of international relations can be considered the failure of diplomacy. Keeping in mind, the use of other tools are part of the communication and negotiation inherent within diplomacy. Sanctions, force, and adjusting trade regulations, while not typically considered part of diplomacy, are actually valuable tools in the interest of leverage and placement in negotiations.
* Sanctions are usually a first resort after the failure of diplomacy, and are one of the main tools used to enforce treaties. They can take the form of diplomatic or economic sanctions and involve the cutting of ties and imposition of barriers to communication or trade.
* War, the use of force, is often thought of as the ultimate tool of international relations. A popular definition is that given by Carl von Clausewitz, with war being &quot;the continuation of politics by other means&quot;. There is a growing study into &quot;new wars&quot; involving actors other than states. The study of war in international relations is covered by the disciplines of &quot;war studies&quot; and &quot;strategic studies&quot;.
* The mobilization of international shame can also be thought of as a tool of international relations. This is attempting to alter states&#x27; actions through &#x27;naming and shaming&#x27; at the international level. This is mostly done by the large human rights NGOs such as Amnesty International (for instance when it called Guantanamo Bay a &quot;Gulag&quot;), or Human Rights Watch. A prominent use of was the UN Commission on Human Rights 1235 procedure, which publicly exposes state&#x27;s human rights violations. The current UN Human Rights Council has yet to use this mechanism.
* The allotment of economic and/or diplomatic benefits such as the European Union&#x27;s enlargement policy; candidate countries are only allowed to join if they meet the Copenhagen criteria.
* The mutual exchange of ideas, information, art, music, and language among nations through cultural diplomacy has also been recognized by governments as an important tool in the development of international relations.

===Unit-level concepts in international relations===
As a level of analysis the unit level is often referred to as the state level, as it locates its explanation at the level of the state, rather than the international system.

====Regime type====
It is often considered that a state&#x27;s form of government can dictate the way that a state interacts with others in the international relation.

Democratic peace theory is a theory that suggests that the nature of democracy means that democratic countries will not go to war with each other. The justifications for this are that democracies externalize their norms and only go to war for just causes, and that democracy encourages mutual trust and respect.

Communism justifies a world revolution, which similarly would lead to peaceful coexistence, based on a proletarian global society.

====Revisionism versus status quo====
States can be classified by whether they accept the international status quo, or are revisionist—i.e., want change. Revisionist states seek to fundamentally change the rules and practices of international relations, feeling disadvantaged by the status quo. They see the international system as a largely western creation which serves to reinforce current realities. Japan is an example of a state that has gone from being a revisionist state to one that is satisfied with the status quo, because the status quo is now beneficial to it.

====Religion====
Religion can have an effect on the way a state acts within the international system, and different theoretical perspectives treat it in somewhat different fashion. One dramatic example is the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) that ravaged much of Europe, which was at least partly motivated by theological differences within Christianity. Religion is a major organizing principle particularly for Islamic states, whereas secularism sits at the other end of the spectrum, with the separation of state and religion being responsible for the liberal international relations theory. The September 11 attacks in the United States, the role of Islam in terrorism, and religious strife in the Middle East have made the role of religion in international relations a major topic. China&#x27;s reemergence as a major international power is believed by some scholars to be shaped by Confucianism.

===Individual or sub-unit level concepts===

The level beneath that of the unit (state) can be useful both for explaining factors in international relations that other theories fail to explain, and for moving away from a state-centric view of international relations.
* Psychological factors in international relationsUnderstanding a state is not a &quot;black box&quot; as proposed by realism, and that there may be other influences on foreign policy decisions. Examining the role of personalities in the decision-making process can have some explanatory power, as can the role of misperception between various actors. A prominent application of sub-unit level psychological factors in international relations is the concept of Groupthink, another is the propensity of policymakers to think in terms of analogies.
* Bureaucratic politicsLooks at the role of the bureaucracy in decision-making, and sees decisions as a result of bureaucratic infighting, and as having been shaped by various constraints.
* Religious, ethnic, and secessionist groupsViewing these aspects of the sub-unit level has explanatory power with regards to ethnic conflicts, religious wars, transnational diaspora (diaspora politics) and other actors which do not consider themselves to fit with the defined state boundaries. This is particularly useful in the context of the pre-modern world of weak states.
* Science, technology and international relationsHow science and technology impact global health, business, environment, technology, and development.
* International political economy, and economic factors in international relations
* International political culturologyLooks at how culture and cultural variables impact in international relations
* Personal relations between leaders

===Generalist inter-state organizations===
====United Nations====

The United Nations (UN) is an international organization that describes itself as a &quot;global association of governments facilitating co-operation in international law, international security, economic development, and social equity&quot;; It is the most prominent international institution. Many of the legal institutions follow the same organizational structure as the UN.

<text>Puerto Ricans (), most commonly known as [[Puerto Ricans|Boricuas]], but also occasionally referred to as &quot;Borinqueños&quot;, &quot;Borincanos&quot;, or &quot;Puertorros&quot;, are an ethnic group native to the Caribbean archipelago and island of Puerto Rico, and a nation identified with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico through ancestry, culture, or history. Puerto Ricans are predominately a tri-racial, Spanish-speaking, Christian society, descending in varying degrees from Indigenous Taíno natives, Southwestern European colonists, and West and Central African slaves, freedmen, and free Blacks. As citizens of a U.S. territory, Puerto Ricans have automatic birthright American citizenship, and are considerably influenced by American culture. The population of Puerto Ricans is between 9 and 10 million worldwide, with the overwhelming majority residing in Puerto Rico and mainland United States.

==Overview==

The culture held in common by most Puerto Ricans is referred to as a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Spain, and more specifically Andalusia and the Canary Islands. Puerto Rico has also received immigration from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia as well as from other European countries such as France, Ireland, Italy and Germany. Puerto Rico has also been influenced by African culture, with many Puerto Ricans partially descended from Africans, though Afro-Puerto Ricans of unmixed African descent are only a significant minority. Also present in today&#x27;s Puerto Ricans are traces (about 10-15%) of the aboriginal Taíno natives that inhabited the island at the time European colonizers arrived in 1493. Recent studies in population genetics have concluded that Puerto Rican gene pool is on average predominantly European, with a significant Sub-Saharan African, North African Guanche, and Indigenous American substrate, the latter two originating in the aboriginal people of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico&#x27;s pre-Columbian Taíno inhabitants, respectively.

The population of Puerto Ricans and descendants is estimated to be between 8 and 10 million worldwide, with most living on the islands of Puerto Rico and in the United States mainland. Within the United States, Puerto Ricans are present in all states of the Union, and the states with the largest populations of Puerto Ricans relative to the national population of Puerto Ricans in the United States at large are the states of New York, Florida, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, with large populations also in Massachusetts, Connecticut, California, Illinois, and Texas.

For 2009, the American Community Survey estimates give a total of 3,859,026 Puerto Ricans classified as &quot;Native&quot; Puerto Ricans. It also gives a total of 3,644,515 (91.9%) of the population being born in Puerto Rico and 201,310 (5.1%) born in the United States. The total population born outside Puerto Rico is 322,773 (8.1%). Of the 108,262 who were foreign born outside the United States (2.7% of Puerto Ricans), 92.9% were born in Latin America, 3.8% in Europe, 2.7% in Asia, 0.2% in Northern America, and 0.1% in Africa and Oceania each.

==Number of Puerto Ricans==
===Population (1765–1897)===
The populations during Spanish rule of Puerto Rico were:
===Current population and ethnic identity (2020)===

==Ancestry and genetics ==
The original inhabitants of Puerto Rico are the Taíno, who called the island &quot;Borikén or Borinquen&quot;; however, as in other parts of the Americas, the native people soon diminished in number after the arrival of Spanish settlers. Besides miscegenation, the negative impact on the numbers of Amerindian people, especially in Puerto Rico, was almost entirely the result of Old World diseases that the Amerindians had no natural/bodily defenses against, including measles, chicken pox, mumps, influenza, and even the common cold. In fact, it was estimated that the majority of all the Amerindian inhabitants of the New World died out due to contact and contamination with those Old World diseases, while those that survived were further reduced through deaths by warfare with Spanish colonizers and settlers.

Thousands of Spanish settlers also immigrated to Puerto Rico from the Canary Islands during the 18th and 19th centuries, so many so that whole Puerto Rican villages and towns were founded by Canarian immigrants, and their descendants would later form a majority of the population on the island.

In 1791, the slaves in Saint-Domingue (Haiti), revolted against their French masters. Many of the French escaped to Puerto Rico via what is now the Dominican Republic and settled in the west coast of the island, especially in Mayagüez. Some Puerto Ricans are of British heritage, most notably Scottish people and English people who came to reside there in the 17th and 18th centuries.

When Spain revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 with the intention of attracting non-Spanish Europeans to settle in the island, thousands of Corsicans (though the island was French since 1768 the population spoke an Italian dialect similar to Tuscan Italian) during the 19th century immigrated to Puerto Rico, along with German immigrants as well as Irish immigrants who were affected by the Great Famine of the 1840s, immigrated to Puerto Rico. They were followed by smaller waves from other European countries and China.

During the early 20th century Jews began to settle in Puerto Rico. The first large group of Jews to settle in Puerto Rico were European refugees fleeing German–occupied Europe in the 1930s and 1940s. The second influx of Jews to the island came in the 1950s, when thousands of Cuban Jews fled Cuba after Fidel Castro came to power.

===Ethnogenesis===
The native Taino population began to dwindle, with the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, through disease and intermarriage. Many Spaniard men took Taino and West African wives and in the first centuries of the Spanish colonial period the island was overwhelmingly racially mixed. &quot;By 1530 there were 14 native women married to Spaniards, not to mention Spaniards with concubines.&quot; Under Spanish rule, mass immigration shifted the ethnic make-up of the island, as a result of the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815. Puerto Rico went from being two-thirds black and mulatto in the beginning of the 19th century, to being nearly 80% white by the middle of the 20th century. This was compounded by more flexible attitudes to race under Spanish rule, as epitomized by the &quot;Regla del Sacar&quot;. Under Spanish rule, Puerto Rico had laws such as &quot;Regla del Sacar&quot; or &quot;Gracias al Sacar&quot;, which allowed persons of mixed ancestry to pay a fee to be classified as white, which was the opposite of &quot;one-drop rule&quot; in US society after the American Civil War.

Studies have shown that the racial ancestry mixture of the average Puerto Rican (regardless of racial self-identity) is about 64% European, 21% African, and 15% Native Taino, with European ancestry strongest on the west side of the island and West African ancestry strongest on the east side, and the levels of Taino ancestry (which, according to some research, ranges from about 5%-35%) generally highest in the southwest of the island.

A study of a sample of 96 healthy self-identified White Puerto Ricans and self-identified Black Puerto Ricans in the U.S. showed that, although all carried a contribution from all 3 ancestral populations (European, African, and Amerindian), the proportions showed significant variation. Depending on individuals, although often correlating with their self-identified race, African ancestry ranged from less than 10% to over 50%, while European ancestry ranged from under 20% to over 80%. Amerindian ancestry showed less fluctuation, generally hovering between 5% and 20% irrespective of self-identified race.

The majority of the European ancestry in Puerto Ricans comes from southern Spain, more specifically the Canary Islands, this is also true for many Dominicans and Cubans. Canarians are of partial Guanche ancestry, a North African Berber ethnic group who were the original inhabitants before Spanish conquest. This means that by extension, many Puerto Ricans have minuscule amounts of North African blood through the indigenous Guanches of the Canary Islands.

==Race and ethnicity==
===White===
In the 1899 census, taken the year Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States following its invasion and annexation in the Spanish–American War, 61.8% of the people were identified as White. In the 2020 United States census the total of Puerto Ricans that self-identified as White was 17.1% or 560,592 out of the 3,285,874 people living in Puerto Rico, down from 75.8% in the 2010 Census, reflecting a change in perceptions of race in Puerto Rico. For every United States census until 2010, most Puerto Ricans self identified as &quot;white&quot;.

The European ancestry of Puerto Ricans comes primarily from one source: Spaniards (including Canarians, Catalans, Castilians, Galicians, Asturians, Andalusians, and Basques).
The Canarian cultural influence in Puerto Rico is one of the most important components in which many villages were founded from these immigrants, which started from 1493 to 1890 and beyond. Many Spaniards, especially Canarians, chose Puerto Rico because of its Hispanic ties and relative proximity in comparison with other former Spanish colonies. They searched for security and stability in an environment similar to that of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico was the most suitable. This began as a temporary exile which became a permanent relocation and the last significant wave of Spanish or European migration to Puerto Rico.

Other sources of European populations are Corsicans, French, Italians, Portuguese (especially Azoreans), Greeks, Germans, Irish, Scots, Maltese, Dutch, English, and Danes.

===Black===

In the 2020 United States census, 7.0% of people self-identified as Black. Africans were brought by Spanish Conquistadors. The vast majority of the Africans who were brought to Puerto Rico did so as a result of the slave trade taking place from many groups in the African continent, but particularly the West Africans, the Yoruba, the Igbo, and the Kongo people.

===Indigenous===

Indigenous people make up the third largest racial identity among Puerto Ricans, comprising 0.5% of the population. Although this self-identification may be ethno-political in nature since unmixed Tainos no longer exist as a discrete genetic population. Native American admixture in Puerto Ricans ranges between about 5% and 35%, with around 15% being the approximate average.

Puerto Rico&#x27;s self-identified indigenous population therefore consist mostly of indigenous-identified persons (oftentimes with predominant Indigenous ancestry, but not always) from within the genetically mestizo population of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry, even when most other Puerto Ricans of their exact same mixture would identify either as mixed-race or even as white.

===Asian===

For its 2020 census, the U.S. Census Bureau listed the following groups to constitute &quot;Asian&quot;: Asian Indian, Bangladeshi, Bhutanese, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Malaysian, Nepalese, Pakistani, Sri Lankan, Taiwanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Other Asian. Though, the largest groups come from China and India. These groups represented 0.1% of the population.

===Other===
People of &quot;Some other race alone&quot; or &quot;Two or more races&quot; constituted 75.3% of the population in the 2020 Census.

Although the average Puerto Rican is of mixed-race, few actually identified as multiracial (&quot;two or more races&quot;) in the 2010 census; only 3.3% did so. They more often identified with their predominant heritage or phenotype. However, in the 2020 census, the amount of Puerto Ricans identifying as multiracial went up to 49.8% and an additional 25.5% identified as &quot;some other race&quot;, showing a marked change in the way Puerto Ricans view themselves. This may show that Puerto Ricans are now more open to embracing all sides of their mixed-race heritage and do not view themselves as part of the standard race dynamic in the United States hence the high number of people identifying as &quot;some other race&quot;, a similar phenomenon went on in the mainland United States with the overall US Hispanic/Latino population. 
Most have significant ancestry from two or more of the founding source populations of Spaniards, Africans, and Tainos, although Spanish ancestry is predominant in a majority of the population. Small amounts of Puerto Ricans may have additional ancestries from other parts of the world. Similar to many other Latin American ethnic groups, Puerto Ricans are multi-generationally mixed race, though most are European dominant in ancestry, Puerto Ricans who are &quot;evenly mixed&quot; can accurately be described &quot;&quot;Mulatto&quot;, &quot;Quadroon&quot;&quot;, or &quot;Tri-racial&quot; very similar to mixed populations in Cuba and Dominican Republic. According to the National Geographic Genographic Project, &quot;the average Puerto Rican individual carries 12% Native American, 65% West Eurasian (Mediterranean, Northern European and/or Middle Eastern) and 20% Sub-Saharan African DNA.&quot;

In genetic terms, even many of those of pure Spanish origin would have North and, in some cases, West African ancestry brought from founder populations, particularly in the Canary Islands. Along with European, West African, and Taino, many Puerto Ricans have small amounts of North African blood due to settlers from Canary Islands, the Spanish province where most Puerto Ricans draw their European ancestry from, being of partial North African blood. Very few self-identified Black Puerto Ricans are of unmixed African ancestry, while a genetically unmixed Amerindian population in Puerto Rico is technically extinct despite a minuscule segment of self-identified Amerindian Puerto Ricans due to a minor Amerindian component in their ancestral mixture. Research data shows that 60% of Puerto Ricans carry maternal lineages of Native American origin and the typical Puerto Rican has between 5% and 15% Native American admixture.

===Modern identity===
The Puerto Rico of today has come to form some of its own social customs, cultural matrix, historically rooted traditions, and its own unique pronunciation, vocabulary, and idiomatic expressions within the Spanish language, known as Puerto Rican Spanish. Even after the attempted assimilation of Puerto Rico into the United States in the early 20th century, the majority of the people of Puerto Rico feel pride in their Puerto Rican nationality, regardless of the individual&#x27;s particular racial, ethnic, political, or economic background. Many Puerto Ricans are consciously aware of the rich contribution of all cultures represented on the island. This diversity can be seen in the everyday lifestyle of many Puerto Ricans such as the profound Latin, African, and Taíno influences regarding food, music, dance, and architecture.

==Emigration==

During the Spanish colonial period, there was significant migration from Puerto Rico to Santo Domingo (DR), Cuba, the Virgin Islands, and Venezuela, and vice versa, because migration between neighboring colonies especially under the same European power, was common. Nearly all Puerto Ricans who migrated to these areas during these times, assimilated and intermixed with the local populations. In the early days of US rule, from 1900 to the 1940s, the Puerto Rican economy was small and undeveloped, it relied heavily on agriculture. At this time, Puerto Rican migration waves were mainly to Dominican Republic, the Virgin Islands, and US cities such as Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Miami, New Orleans, and most importantly metropolitan area surrounding New York City and North Jersey. Over 5,000 Puerto Ricans migrated to Hawaii from 1900 to 1901. Puerto Rican migration to the US northeast started as early as the 1890s; however, it was a very, very small flow at the time. During the 1940s, Puerto Rican desire for independence slowly started to decline while desire for statehood and dependence on the US started rise, due to this more Puerto Ricans started to look at the US more favorably and take full advantage of their US citizenship, huge flows of Puerto Ricans started to arrive in the United States, particularly industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest, coinciding with a strong decline in Puerto Ricans migrating to other countries and even other areas in the US like Baltimore, New Orleans, and Hawaii. From 1940 to 1960, the stateside Puerto Rican population rose from 69,967 to 892,513.

In the modern day, there are about 5.9 million Puerto Ricans in the US mainland. Large concentrations can be found in the Northeast region and in Florida, in the metropolitan areas of New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Miami, Chicago, Tampa, and Boston, among others. Though, over 95% of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico, live in the United States (US states), there is a significant and growing number of Puerto Ricans, mainly from Puerto Rico itself but to a lesser degree stateside Puerto Ricans as well, living outside the 50 States and the US territory of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican populations in other countries are very small, not large enough to have dominance over certain neighborhoods and cities like in Florida and the US Northeast. Unsurprisingly, Puerto Rico&#x27;s neighbors have the biggest Puerto Rican communities outside Puerto Rico and the US mainland, to the west Dominican Republic with as high as 20,000 Puerto Ricans according to some sources, and to the east US Virgin Islands with 7,759, 8.9% of the territory&#x27;s population, second highest percentage of any US state or territory, after Puerto Rico (95.5%) and before Connecticut (8.0%). There are small numbers of Puerto Ricans in other countries like Canada, Spain, Mexico, United Kingdom, and other countries in Europe and the Caribbean/Latin America. Due to Puerto Rico being a US territory, the vast majority of Puerto Ricans leaving the island go to the mainland United States, comprising Puerto Ricans of all income brackets and lifestyles. However, majority of the small number of Puerto Ricans living outside of the United States, including outside of Puerto Rico and other territories, are usually financially well-off and entrepreneurial, owning homes and businesses in the countries they choose to settle in. Statistical counts of Puerto Rican populations in other countries usually only center on ethnic Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico. Non-Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico and later moving to target country usually wouldn&#x27;t be included in a Puerto Rican population count, especially if they have ancestry of at least one parent born in target country, for example people of Dominican, Cuban, or Mexican etc ancestry born in Puerto Rico and later returning to their ancestral country- wouldn&#x27;t be counted in a Puerto Rican population count, but likely rather counted as a &quot;returning emigrant&quot;. Similarly, Puerto Ricans born in the mainland United States would be counted under an &quot;American&quot; statistic, so the Puerto Rican populations abroad may be slightly larger as some may be stateside-born and counted as &quot;American&quot; rather than &quot;Puerto Rican&quot; on local government statistics on immigrants.

==Language==
Spanish and English are the official languages of the entire Commonwealth. A 1902 English-only language law was abolished on April 5, 1991. Then on January 28, 1993, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved Law Number 1 again making Spanish and English the official languages of Puerto Rico. All official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. The official languages of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population.

Puerto Rican Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island. The US Census Bureau&#x27;s 2015 update provides the following: 94.1% of adults speak Spanish, 5.8% speak only English and little to no Spanish, 78.3% do not speak English &quot;very well&quot;, 15.8% are fully bilingual in both English and Spanish, 0.1% speak other languages.

Public school instruction in Puerto Rico is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English. English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school.

Home to a sizeable deaf community, the actual numbers are unknown due to unavailable source data. A 1986 estimate places the Puerto Rican deaf population to be between 8,000 and 40,000. Due to ongoing colonization from the US mainland, the larger American Sign Language (ASL) is supplanting the local Puerto Rican Sign Language (PRSL, also known as LSPR: &quot;Lenguaje de Señas Puertorriqueño&quot;). Although assumed to be a dialect or variant of ASL, it is currently unknown the degree of mutual intelligibility between Puerto Rican Sign Language nor whether it is even a Francosign language like ASL. Indeed, there is a hesitancy amongst Puerto Rican Deaf to even mention LSPR after heavy handed oralist education of English, Spanish, and Signed English. Today, there is much contact between ASL, PRSL, and Signed Spanish.

The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. While the Spanish spoken in all Iberian, Mediterranean and Atlantic Spanish Maritime Provinces was brought to the island over the centuries, the most profound regional influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has been from that spoken in the present-day Canary Islands. The Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes occasional Taíno words, typically in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music or dances.

==Religion==
There are many religious beliefs represented in the island. Religious breakdown in Puerto Rico (as of 2006) is given in the table on the right.

The majority of Puerto Ricans in the island are Christians. Spiritists have a large secondary following. Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Buddhists all have a small presence as well. Roman Catholicism has been the main Christian denomination among Puerto Ricans since the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century, but the presence of Protestant, Mormon, Pentecostal, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses denominations has increased under U.S. sovereignty, making modern Puerto Rico an inter-denominational, multi-religious community. The Afro-Caribbean religion Santería is also practiced.

In 1998, a news report stated that &quot;Puerto Rico [was] no longer predominantly Catholic&quot;. Pollster Pablo Ramos wrote that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches. However, an Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that &quot;more than 70 percent of [Puerto Ricans] identify themselves as Catholic&quot;. The CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other.

==Political and international status==

Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the passage of the Jones–Shafroth Act of 1917. Since this law was the result of Congressional legislation, and not the result of an amendment to the United States Constitution, the current U.S. citizenship of Puerto Ricans can be revoked by Congress, as they are &quot;statutory citizens&quot;, not &quot;14th Amendment citizens&quot;. The Jones Act established that Puerto Ricans born prior to 1899 were considered naturalized citizens of Puerto Rico, and anyone born after 1898 were U.S. citizens, unless the Puerto Rican expressed his/her intentions to remain a Spanish subject. Since 1948, it was decided by Congress that all Puerto Ricans, whether born within the United States or in Puerto Rico, were naturally born United States citizens.

Puerto Ricans and other U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in presidential elections as that is a right reserved by the U.S. Constitution to admitted states and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College system. Nevertheless, both the Democratic Party and Republican Party, while not fielding candidates for public office in Puerto Rico, provide the islands with state-sized voting delegations at their presidential nominating conventions. Delegate selection processes frequently have resulted in presidential primaries being held in Puerto Rico. U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico do not elect U.S. representatives or senators. However, Puerto Rico is represented in the House of Representatives by an elected representative commonly known as the Resident Commissioner, who has the same duties and obligations as a representative, with the exception of being able to cast votes on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor. The Resident Commissioner is elected by Puerto Ricans to a four-year term and does serve on congressional committee. Puerto Ricans residing in the U.S. states have all rights and privileges of other U.S. citizens living in the states.

As statutory U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico may enlist in the U.S. military and have been included in the compulsory draft when it has been in effect. Puerto Ricans have fully participated in all U.S. wars and military conflicts since 1898, including World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War.

Since 2007, the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans. In order to be eligible, applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico; born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican-born parent; or be an American citizen with at least one year residence in Puerto Rico. The citizenship is internationally recognized by Spain, which considers Puerto Rico to be an Ibero-American nation. Therefore, Puerto Rican citizens have the ability to apply for Spanish citizenship after only two years residency in Spain (instead of the standard 10 years).

Puerto Rican voters, despite not voting in the 2024 election for the President on the island, nevertheless were a surprisingly important political &quot;hot potato&quot; for both parties, due to the large number of Puerto Rican voters on the mainland.

===Decolonization and status referendums===
Since 1953, the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving &quot;independence&quot; or &quot;decolonization.&quot; In 1978, the Special Committee determined that a &quot;colonial relationship&quot; existed between the US and Puerto Rico.

The UN&#x27;s Special Committee has referred often to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity. Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty&quot;.

Puerto Rico has held four referendums to determine whether to retain its status as a territory or to switch to some other status such as statehood. The fourth, the Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012 occurred on November 6, 2012. The result a 54% majority of the ballots cast against the continuation of the island&#x27;s territorial political status, and in favor of a new status. Of votes for new status, a 61.1% majority chose statehood. This was by far the most successful referendum for statehood advocates. In all earlier referenda, votes for statehood were matched almost equally by votes for remaining an American territory, with the remainder for independence. Support for U.S. statehood has risen in each successive popular referendum.

The fifth Puerto Rican status referendum of 2017, was held on June 11, 2017, and offered three options: &quot;Statehood&quot;, &quot;Independence/Free Association&quot;, and &quot;Current Territorial Status.&quot; With 23% of registered voters casting ballots, 97% voted for statehood. Benefits of statehood would include an additional $10 billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is currently prohibited.

Even with the Puerto Ricans&#x27; vote for statehood, action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Plutus (; ) is the god and the personification of wealth, and the son of the goddess of agriculture Demeter and the mortal Iasion.

==Family==
Plutus is most commonly the son of Demeter and Iasion, with whom she lay in a thrice-ploughed field. He is alternatively the son of the fortune goddess Tyche.

Two ancient depictions of Plutus, one of him as a little boy standing with a cornucopia before Demeter, and another inside the cornucopia being handed to Demeter by a goddess rising out of the earth, perhaps implying that he had been born in the Underworld, were interpreted by Karl Kerenyi to mean that Plutus was supposed to be the son of Hades and Persephone, the king and the queen of the Underworld, though no such version is attested in any primary source.

==In the arts==
In the philosophized mythology of the later Classical period, Plutus is envisaged by Aristophanes as blinded by Zeus, so that he would be able to dispense his gifts without prejudice; he is also lame, as he takes his time arriving, and winged, so he leaves faster than he came. When the god&#x27;s sight is restored, in Aristophanes&#x27; comedy, he is then able to determine who is deserving of wealth, creating havoc.

Phaedrus records a fable where, after Hercules is received in Olympus, he greets all the gods but refuses to greet Plutus. When the king of gods Jupiter asks him why, he replies that he hates the god of riches due to Plutus favouring the wicked and the corrupt.

Among the Eleusinian figures painted on Greek ceramics, regardless of whether he is depicted as child or youthful &quot;ephebe&quot;, Plutus can be identified as the one bearing the cornucopia—horn of plenty. In later allegorical bas-reliefs, Plutus is depicted as a boy in the arms of Eirene, as Prosperity is the gift of &quot;Peace&quot;, or in the arms of Tyche, the Fortune of Cities.

In Lucian of Samosata&#x27;s satirical dialogue &quot;Timon&quot;, Plutus, the very embodiment of worldly goods written up in a parchment will, says to Hermes:
In Canto VII of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, Plutus is a demon of wealth who guards the fourth circle of Hell, &quot;The Hoarders and the Wasters&quot;. Dante likely included Plutus to symbolize the evil of hoarding wealth. He is known for saying the famous phrase, &quot;Pape Satàn, pape Satàn aleppe.&quot;

In addition, 
Erasmus writes in The Praise of Folly that Folly is the offspring of Plutus. 

==Etymology==
Like many other figures in Greek and Roman mythology, Plutus&#x27; name is related to several English words. These include:
* Plutocracy, rule by the wealthy, and plutocrat, one who rules by virtue of wealth
* Plutonomics, the study of wealth management
* , the &quot;worship&quot; of money
* , an excessive desire for wealth

<text>Iaso (; , &quot;Iāsō&quot;) or Ieso (; , &quot;Iēsō&quot;) was the Greek goddess of recuperation from illness. The daughter of Asclepius, she had four sisters: Aceso, Aegle, Hygieia, and Panacea. All five were associated with some aspect of health or healing. For more information on the genealogy of Iaso, see Panacea.

==Description==
Pausanias (author of &quot;Periegesis of Greece&quot;) wrote this of Amphiaraus in Oropos, Attica, in the 2nd century A.D.:

The altar shows parts. One part is to Heracles, Zeus, and Apollo Healer, another is given up to heroes and to wives of heroes, the third is to Hestia and Hermes and Amphiaraus and the children of Amphilochus. But Alcmaeon, because of his treatment of Eriphyle, is honored neither in the temple of Amphiaraus nor yet with Amphilochus. The fourth portion of the altar is to Aphrodite and Panacea, and further to Iaso, Hygeia, and Athena Healer. The fifth is dedicated to the nymphs and to Pan, and to the rivers Achelous and Cephisus.

Aristophanes mentions Iaso humorously in &quot;Ploutos&quot;, when one of the characters, Cario, reports that Iaso blushed upon his passing gas.

In the temple of Amphiaraus at Oropus a part of the altar was dedicated to her, in common with Aphrodite, Panaceia, Hygieia, and Athena Paeonia. 

Iaso had many children.

<text>In Greek mythology, ichor () is the ethereal fluid that is the blood of the gods and/or immortals. The Ancient Greek word () is of uncertain etymology, and has been suggested to be a foreign word, possibly the Pre-Greek substrate.

==In classical myth==
Ichor originates in Greek mythology, where it is the &quot;ethereal fluid&quot; that is the blood of the Greek gods, sometimes said to retain the qualities of the immortals&#x27; food and drink, ambrosia and nectar. Ichor is described as toxic to humans, killing them instantly if they came in contact with it. Great heroes and demigods occasionally attacked gods and released ichor, but gods rarely did so to each other in Homeric myth.

In Ancient Crete, tradition told of Talos, a giant man of bronze. When Cretan mythology was appropriated by the Greeks, they imagined him more like the Colossus of Rhodes. He possessed a single vein running with ichor that was stoppered by a nail in his back. Talos guarded Europa on Crete and threw boulders at intruders, until the Argonauts came after the acquisition of the Golden Fleece, and the sorceress Medea took out the nail, releasing the ichor and killing him.

It [a magical herb] first appeared in a plant that sprang from the blood-like ichor of Prometheus in his torment, which the flesh-eating Eagle had dropped on the spurs of the Kaukasos.

Prometheus was a Titan, who made humans and stole fire from the gods and gave it to the mortals, and consequently was punished by Zeus for all eternity. Prometheus was chained to a rock for his sin, and his liver was eaten daily by an eagle. His liver would then regrow, just to be eaten again, repeated for all eternity. Prometheus bled ichor, a golden, blood-like substance that would cause a magical herb to sprout when it touched the ground.

==In medicine==
In pathology, &quot;ichor&quot; is an antiquated term for a watery discharge from a wound or ulcer, with an unpleasant or (offensive) smell.

The Greek Christian writer Clement of Alexandria deliberately confounded &quot;ichor&quot; in its medical sense as a foul-smelling watery discharge from a wound or ulcer with its mythological sense as the blood of the gods, in a polemic against the pagan Greek gods. As part of his evidence that they are merely mortal, he cites several cases in which the gods are wounded physically, and then asserts that

if there are wounds, there is blood. For the ichor of the poets is more repulsive than blood; for the putrefaction of blood is called ichor.

<text>The Diamant rocket (French for &quot;diamond&quot;) was the first exclusively French expendable launch system and at the same time the first satellite launcher not built by either the United States or USSR. As such, it has been referred to as being a key predecessor for all subsequent European launcher projects. The head of the project, Charley Attali, received the Legion of Honour in 1965 for the Diamant.

During 1962, development of the Diamant commenced as the inaugural spacecraft project of France&#x27;s space agency, the Centre National d&#x27;Études Spatiales (CNES). As a project, it was derived from the military program &quot;pierres précieuses&quot; (fr.: gemstones) that included the five prototypes Agate, Topaze, Emeraude, Rubis and Saphir (Agate, Topaz, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire), and drew heavily upon the knowledge and technologies that had been previously developed. On 26 November 1965, the Diamant A performed its maiden flight. Out of a total of 12 launch attempts to be performed between 1965 and 1975, 9 of these were successful. Most notably, on 26 November 1965, the Diamant was used to successfully launch the first French satellite, named Astérix.

Three successive versions of the Diamant rocket were developed, designated &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;BP4&quot;. All versions had three stages and a payload of approximately 150 kg for a 200 km orbit. Despite the success of the Diamant as a launcher, France ultimately chose to terminate further work on its national launcher program in favour of participation in the multi-European programme to produce what would become the Ariane launcher in 1975.

== Development ==
===Background===
During the late 1940s and 1950s, substantial interest arose amongst the international powers of the era in the development of rocketry and missile technology, in particular the prospects for ballistic missiles capable of travelling great distances. Both of the emergent superpowers of the time, the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) chose to invest heavily within this new field, observing its political and military importance; it was not long before a highly competitive atmosphere emerged where neither entity wished to fall behind the other in missile technology, which directly led to the so-called &#x27;space race&#x27;. In addition, other nations also sought to make headway with this technology, often seeking to exploit and build upon knowledge which had been acquired from Nazi Germany&#x27;s V2 programme. In western Europe, both the United Kingdom and France began making significant early steps in this field.

While Britain forged ahead with programmes such as the Black Knight ballistic missile demonstrator and the military-orientated Blue Steel missile programme, France also made progress on its own efforts. During 1949, the French government established the Laboratoire de Recherches Balistiques et Aérodynamiques at Vernon, outside Paris, for the purpose of pursuing its own military-focused ballistic missiles programmes. The agency initially conducted relatively straightforward and cost-conscious programmes, such as the development of the V2-based Veronique liquid-fuelled rocket in cooperation with a number of German scientists, which first flew during 1954. During 1957, having been suitably encouraged by the progress made, the Comité d&#x27;Action Scientifique de Défense Nationale (CASDN) decided to finance further refinements of the Veronique rocket.

During 1958, French wartime military leader Charles de Gaulle became President of France, establishing the Fifth Republic. De Gaulle, who was openly keen to develop a capable and fully independent French nuclear deterrent, determined that French-built missiles could comprise a potent element of the French military&#x27;s fledgling nuclear arsenal, known as the Force de frappe; further impetus in favour of missile development was generated by the Sputnik crisis, a fear that other powers were falling behind the Soviet Union&#x27;s progress in missile development, which had been provoked by the USSR&#x27;s success with Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite to be successfully orbited. A greatly expanded and renewed framework for missile-related development was promptly issued alongside generous government support for scientific research; specifically, the new efforts covered technologies such as intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missile, and reconnaissance satellites.

===Emergence and success===
During 1959, the French government established the Comité de Recherches Spatiales (CRS), which would later be renamed as the Centre National d&#x27;Études Spatiales (CNES). The newly formed CRS, initially chaired by the French physicist Pierre Auger, was tasked with the coordination of all French research efforts in the field of space. From an early stage, the organisation&#x27;s primary goal was to pursue the development of an indigenous expendable launch system with which payloads, such as satellites, could be launched into orbit. The indigenous launcher, which was promptly named &quot;Diamant&quot;, drew heavily from the military ballistic missile programmes which had preceded it; as such, much of the rocket&#x27;s design was based upon these early missiles.

On 26 November 1965, the first Diamant rocket was fired from its launch site, the CIEES testing range, at Hammaguir, Béchar Province, Algeria. This maiden flight was deemed to be a success, achieving sufficient altitude and launching French&#x27;s first satellite, a 42 kg test vehicle known as Astérix, into orbit; this feat has been viewed as cementing France as the third space power in the world, as well as affirming its independence and strategic capabilities. During 1966 and 1967, Diamant was used to launch three French-built scientific satellites. On 9 April 1968, the Guiana Space Centre, France&#x27;s new national launching complex at Kourou, French Guiana, was officially declared to be operational; Diamant launches were subsequently shifted to this facility, along with various other missiles in use by France and, later on, other European nations as well.

On 10 March 1970, the first &quot;Diamant B&quot; rocket, an improved model of the launcher, was fired, carrying a pair of scientific satellites, named &quot;DIAL/MIKA&quot; and &quot;DIAL/WIKA&quot;, into orbit. Only one of the two satellites, which had been produced as a collaborative effort between France and Germany to study the Van Allen radiation belt around the Earth, survived the launch process. Overall, the Diamant rocket came to be recognised as a successful and reliable launch vehicle, competitive amongst even the best of its international competitors throughout the world during its time.

===Successor and discontinuation===
While Diamant had proven to be a viable and reliable launcher, the sheer size of the American and Soviet space programmes far exceeded what would be realistically achievable not only by France but by any of the independent nations of western Europe. As this realisation became prevalent, it was also recognised that cooperative efforts between nations and a new generation of international programmes would enable these nations to play a much greater and significant role in space exploration. Early collaborative programmes, such as the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), bore mixed results but showed the promise of such endeavours, thus a greater emphasis was placed upon international efforts on the topic of space.

As a consequence of Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from participation in the ELDO, it was decided to replace the British-built Blue Streak, which comprised the first stage of the organisation&#x27;s multinational launcher, known as Europa, with the French-built Diamant taking its place. All work on the Europa programme was terminated only a few years later due to the high failure rate encountered. Meanwhile, Britain decided to focus its efforts on the indigenous Black Arrow launcher instead.

During 1974, the European Space Agency (ESA) was founded for this purpose; the ESA effectively enabled the competing and overlapping national space programmes to be succeeded by a single organised multinational framework with work shared between the member states instead. Specifically, in 1976, work commenced on the new collaborative Ariane 1 launcher, the first version of what would become the highly successful Ariane family. The existence of the Ariane programme, a rival launcher to the earlier Diamant rocket, effectively replaced the demand for and the role of France&#x27;s indigenous launcher, rendering it obsolete and redundant in comparison. France ultimately decided to discontinue further launches using Diamant in favour of the newer Ariane platform.

== Variants ==

=== Diamant A ===

This was the first version of the Diamant rockets, operational between 1965 and 1967. Remarkably for a newly developed system, all of the first four launches attempted launched were partly successful, the only failure occurring on the second launch when the payload was inserted into a lower orbit than planned. 

Completely assembled, a Diamant A was 18.95 metres high and weighed 18.4 metric tons.

It possessed a first stage of 9.92m length, 1.34 metres in diameter, and a weight of 14.7 metric tons. The first stage had a &quot;Vexin B&quot; nitric acid/turpentine engine supplying a thrust of 274 kN for 93 seconds.

The &quot;Topaze&quot; second stage was 4.70 metres long and had a diameter of 80 centimetres. It weighed 2.93 metric tons and had a four solid propellant engine that developed a thrust of 150 kN for a duration of 44 seconds. 

The third stage is 1.85 m long and weighed 708 kilograms. Its &quot;P064&quot; solid-propellant engine burned for 45 seconds and developed a thrust of 52 kN.

=== Diamant B ===
Diamant B was an improved version of the Diamant A with a more powerful first stage, being able to place a 190 kg payload at a 200 km orbit inclined at 5°, a 25 kg payload at a 1000 km orbit, or a 130 kg payload in low polar orbit.

Five satellite launches were attempted between 1970 and 1973, of which the last two failed. All launches took place from Kourou in French Guiana.

Completely assembled, a Diamant B was 23.5 metres high and weighed 26.9 metric tons.

Its &quot;Améthyste&quot; first stage was 14.2 meters long, had a diameter of 1.4 metres and weighed 20 metric tons. Its &quot;LRBA Valois&quot; N2O4/UDMH engine developed a thrust of 315 kN for 116 seconds. 

The &quot;Topaze&quot; &quot;P-2.2&quot; second stage had one P4 solid propellant engine that developed a thrust of 150 kN for a duration of 44 seconds. 

The &quot;P06&quot; third stage was 1.66 metres long and had a diameter of 80 centimetres. Its &quot;P0.68&quot; solid propellant engine developed a thrust of 50 kN for 46 seconds. 

=== Diamant BP4 ===
This version incorporates a new second stage, while carrying the first and third stages over from its predecessor. It performed three successful launches in 1975, putting a total of four satellites into orbit. 

Completely assembled, a Diamant BP4 measured 22.68 metres high and weighed 20.3 metric tons. 

Its &quot;Rita&quot; &quot;P-4&quot; second stage, which was derived from the MSBS rocket, was 2.28 metres long, 1.51 metres in diameter and its &quot;P4&quot; solid propellant engine developed a thrust of 176 kN for 55 seconds.

<doc id="82562" wikidata="Q655566" url="?curid=82562" title="Ascanius">
<text>Ascanius (; Ancient Greek: Ἀσκάνιος) was a legendary king of Alba Longa (1176-1138 BC) and the son of the Trojan hero Aeneas and Creusa, daughter of Priam. He is a significant figure in Roman mythology because of his genealogy: as the son of the Roman founding father Aeneas, himself the son of the goddess Venus and the Trojan prince Anchises, he was regarded as an ancestor of the Roman people. Under his additional name Iulus, he was claimed as the particular ancestor of the gens Iulia, the family of Julius Caesar, and therefore a progenitor of the first line of Roman emperors, the Julio-Claudian dynasty. In some Roman genealogies, he is also made to be an ancestor of Romulus and Remus. Together with his father, he is a major character in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

==Mythology==
In Greek and Roman mythology, Ascanius was the son of the Trojan prince Aeneas and Creusa, daughter of Priam. After the Trojan War, as the city burned, Aeneas escaped to Latium in Italy, taking his father Anchises and his child Ascanius with him, though Creusa died during the escape.

According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Ascanius&#x27; original name was Euryleon and this name was changed to Ascanius after his flight from Troy. According to Virgil, Ascanius was also called Iulus or Julus. The gens Julia, the clan to which Julius Caesar belonged, claimed descent from Ascanius/Iulus, his father Aeneas, and, ultimately, the goddess Venus, the mother of Aeneas in myth, his father being the mortal Anchises.
Dionysius however, identified Julus as a son of Ascanius who disputed the succession of the kingdom of Alba Longa with Silvius, upon the death of Ascanius.

According to another legend mentioned by Livy, Ascanius may have been the son of Aeneas and Lavinia and thus born in Latium, not Troy. Ascanius later fought in the Italian Wars along with his father Aeneas.

After the death of Aeneas, Ascanius became king of Lavinium and an Etruscan king named Mezentius took advantage of the occasion to besiege the city. Mezentius succeeded in making the city surrender and agree to pay a yearly tribute. Upon his retirement, Ascanius fell upon him and his army unaware and entirely defeated Mezentius and killed his son Lausus. Mezentius was forced to agree to pay a yearly tribute. Subsequent to this, exactly thirty years after the founding of Lavinium, Ascanius founded the city of Alba Longa and became its first king. He left Lavinia in charge of the city of Lavinium. Ascanius was succeeded by Silvius, who was either his younger brother or his son. Ascanius died in the 28th year of his reign.

==&quot;Aeneid&quot;==
However, in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Virgil claims that Mezentius fought in the Italian Wars at the time Aeneas was alive. In the Aeneid, it is Aeneas who kills Lausus after harming Mezentius, who escaped while his son faced the Trojan king. When the news about Lausus&#x27; death reaches Mezentius, he comes back to face Aeneas, and is killed too. In this account, Ascanius does not participate in these deaths.

Nevertheless, Virgil shows Ascanius&#x27; first experience at war. In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Ascanius is a teenager without real war experiences, but while besieged by the Italians, Ascanius launches an arrow against Numanus, the husband of the youngest sister of Turnus. After killing Numanus, Apollo comes and says to Ascanius:

&quot;Macte nova virtute, puer: sic itur ad astra,&quot;
&quot;dis genite et geniture deos.&quot;

This phrase can be translated into English as: &quot;Go forth with new value, boy: thus is the path to the stars; son of gods that will have gods as sons.&quot; or &quot;Blessings on your fresh courage, boy, scion of gods and ancestor of gods yet to be, so it is man rises to the stars.&quot; In this verse, Virgil makes a clear reference to the offspring of Iulus, from whom Augustus Caesar claimed descent. Therefore, in this verse Virgil refers to the Gens Julia, the family of Augustus and Julius Caesar, who was deified after his death.
&quot;Sic itur ad astra&quot; become proverbial, and several mottos use an &quot;ad astra&quot; phrase. After this episode, Apollo orders to the Trojans to keep Ascanius away from the war.

In this same episode Ascanius, before launching the fatal arrow in Numanus, prays to Jupiter, saying: &quot;Jupiter omnipotens, audacibus annue cœptis&quot; (&quot;Omnipotent Jupiter, please favour my bold attempt&quot;). The last part of the hexameter became the United States motto &quot;annuit coeptis&quot;.

The name Iulus was popularised by Virgil in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;: replacing the Greek name Ascanius with Iulus linked the Julian family of Rome to earlier mythology. The emperor Augustus, who commissioned the work, was a great patron of the arts. As a member of the Julian family, he could claim to have four major Olympian gods in his family tree: (Jupiter, Juno, Venus and Mars), so he encouraged his many poets to emphasize his supposed descent from Aeneas.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Keres (; Ancient Greek: Κῆρες) were female death-spirits. They were the goddesses who personified violent death and who were drawn to bloody deaths on battlefields. Although they were present during death and dying, they did not have the power to kill. All they could do was wait and then feast on the dead. The Keres were daughters of Nyx, and as such the sisters of beings such as Moirai, who controlled the fate of souls, and Thanatos, the god of peaceful death. Some later authorities, such as Cicero, called them by a Latin name, &quot;Tenebrae&quot; (&quot;the Darknesses&quot;), and named them daughters of Erebus and Nyx.

The singular form of the name is Ker (; Κήρ), which, according to Hesiod, refers to an entity distinct from the Keres.

==Etymology==
The Greek word κήρ means &quot;the goddess of death&quot; or &quot;doom&quot; and appears as a proper noun in the singular and plural as Κήρ and Κῆρες to refer to divinities. Homer uses &quot;Κῆρες&quot; in the phrase &quot;κήρες θανάτοιο&quot;, &quot;Keres of death&quot;. By extension the word may mean &quot;plague, disease&quot; and in prose &quot;blemish or defect&quot;. The relative verb &quot;κεραΐζω&quot; or &quot;κείρω&quot; means &quot;ravage or plunder&quot;. Sometimes in Homer the words κήρ and moira have similar meanings. The older meaning was probably &quot;destruction of the dead&quot;, and Hesychius of Alexandria relates the word to the verb &quot;κηραινειν&quot; &quot;decay&quot;.

==Description==

They were described as dark beings with gnashing teeth and claws and with a thirst for human blood. They would hover over the battlefield and search for dying and wounded men. A description of the Keres can be found in the Shield of Heracles (248–57):
A parallel, and equally unusual personification of &quot;the baleful Ker&quot; is in Homer&#x27;s depiction of the Shield of Achilles (&quot;Iliad&quot;, ix. 410ff), which is the model for the &quot;Shield of Heracles&quot;. These are works of art that are being described.

In the fifth century, Keres were portrayed as small winged sprites in vase-paintings adduced by J.E. Harrison (Harrison, 1903), who described apotropaic rites and rites of purification that were intended to keep the Keres at bay.

According to a statement of Stesichorus noted by Eustathius, Stesichorus &quot;called the Keres by the name Telchines&quot;, whom Eustathius identified with the Kuretes of Crete, who could call up squalls of wind and would brew potions from herbs (noted in Harrison, p. 171).

The term &quot;Keres&quot; has also been cautiously used to describe a person&#x27;s fate. An example of this can be found in the &quot;Iliad&quot; where Achilles was given the choice (or &quot;Keres&quot;) between either a long and obscure life and home, or death at Troy and everlasting glory. Also, when Achilles and Hector were about to engage in a fight to the death, the god Zeus weighed both warriors&#x27; &quot;keres&quot; to determine who shall die. As Hector’s &quot;ker&quot; was deemed heavier, he was the one destined to die and in the weighing of souls, Zeus chooses Hector to be killed.
During the festival known as Anthesteria, the Keres were driven away. Their Roman equivalents were Letum (“death”) or the Tenebrae (“shadows”).

==Keres and Valkyries==
Mathias Egeler suggests a connection exists between the Keres and the Valkyries of Norse mythology. Both deities are war spirits that fly over battlefields during conflicts and choose those to be slain. The difference is that Valkyries are benevolent deities in contrast to the malevolence of the Keres, perhaps due to the different outlook of the two cultures towards war. The word &quot;valkyrie&quot; derives from Old Norse &quot;valkyrja&quot; (plural &quot;valkyrjur&quot;), which is composed of two words; the noun &quot;valr&quot; (referring to the slain on the battlefield) and the verb &quot;kjósa&quot; (meaning &quot;to choose&quot;). Together, they mean &quot;chooser of the slain&quot;. The Greek word &quot;Ker&quot; etymologically means destruction, death.

<text>The Anthesteria (; ) was one of the four Athenian festivals in honor of Dionysus. It was held each year from the 11th to the 13th of the month of Anthesterion, around the time of the January or February full moon. The three days of the feast were called , , and .

The festival celebrated the beginning of spring, particularly the maturing of the wine stored at the previous vintage, whose (storage-jars) were now ceremoniously opened. During the feast, social order was interrupted or inverted, the slaves being allowed to participate, uniting the household in ancient fashion. The Anthesteria also had aspects of a festival of the dead: either the Keres () or the Carians () were entertained, freely roaming the city until they were expelled after the festival. However, the word Keres is often used to refer spirits of evil instead of the dead. A Greek proverb, employed of those who pestered for continued favors, ran &quot;Out of doors, Keres! It is no longer Anthesteria&quot;.

==Name==
The name is usually connected with (), the combining form of (, &#x27;flower&#x27;). This is cognate with Sanskrit (&#x27;soma plant&#x27;) and may have referred to the &#x27;bloom&#x27; of the grape vine. The Cambridge ritualist A. W. Verrall, however, glossed the name as a Feast of Revocation (, , to &quot;pray up&quot;) in reference to the aspects of the festival where the dead were considered to walk among the living. Harrison also regarded the Anthesteria as primarily concerned with placating ancestral spirits.

==Origins==
Athenians of the Classical age were aware that the festival was of great antiquity. Its ritual marriage of a queen to Dionysus recalls myths concerning Theseus and Ariadne, but this is no longer considered a dependable sign that the festival had been celebrated in the Minoan period. Since the festival was celebrated by Athens and all the Ionian cities, however, it is assumed that it must have preceded the Ionian migration of the late eleventh or early tenth century BC. This still makes it the oldest datable part of the Eleusinian Mysteries.

==Days==

===Pithoigia===
The first day was (,  &#x27;The Jar-Opening&#x27;). The jars of wine () from the previous year were opened, libations offered to Dionysus, and the entire household (including slaves) joining in the festivities. Spring flowers were used to decorate the rooms of the house, the home&#x27;s drinking vessels, and any children over three years of age.

The days on which the and were celebrated were both regarded as (, &#x27;unlucky&#x27;; Latin equivalent ) and (, &#x27;defiled&#x27;), necessitating expiatory libations. On them, the souls of the dead came up from the underworld and walked abroad. People chewed leaves of hawthorn or buckthorn and besmeared their doors with tar to protect themselves from evil. Nonetheless, the festive character of the ceremonies predominated.

===Choes===
The second day was (, ,  &#x27;The Pouring&#x27;). Merrymaking continued: people dressed themselves gaily, some in the figures of Dionysus&#x27;s entourage, and paid a round of visits to their acquaintances. Drinking clubs held contests to see who could drain their cups the most rapidly. These competitions were done in silence and slaves were also allowed to participate. Others poured libations on the tombs of deceased relatives. The day also marked a state occasion: a peculiarly solemn and secret ceremony in the sanctuary of Dionysus &#x27;in the marshes&#x27; (, ), which was closed throughout the rest of the year. Despite the name, there were no actual marshes in the immediate surroundings of Athens and the sanctuary was located in the Bouleuterion in the Athenian Agora. Athens&#x27; ritual queen, the basilinna, underwent a ceremony of marriage to the god. She was assisted by the , 14 Athenian matrons chosen by her husband the archon basileus, who were sworn to secrecy. Burkert regarded the ceremony as a recreation of the yielding of Ariadne to Dionysus by Theseus during their escape from Crete.

===Chytroi===
The third day was (, ,  &#x27;The Pots&#x27;), a festival of the dead. Fruit or cooked pulse was offered to Hermes in his capacity as Hermes Chthonios, an underworld figure, and to the souls of the dead, who were then bidden to depart. None of the Olympians were included and no one tasted the pottage, which was food of the dead. Celebration continued and games were held. Although no performances were allowed at the theater, a sort of rehearsal took place, at which the players for the ensuing dramatic festival were selected.

<text>In Greek mythology, Pelasgus (, &quot;Pelasgós&quot; means &quot;ancient&quot;) was the eponymous ancestor of the Pelasgians, the mythical inhabitants of Greece who established the worship of the Dodonaean Zeus, Hephaestus, the Cabeiri, and other divinities. In the different parts of the country once occupied by Pelasgians, there existed different traditions as to the origin and connection of Pelasgus. Some ancient Greeks believed that he was the first man.

== Inachid Pelasgoí of Argos ==
: In Argos, several Inachid kings were called Pelasgus:
* Pelasgus, brother to Apis both sons of Phoroneus, is said to have founded the city of Argos in Peloponnesus, to have taught the people agriculture, and to have received Demeter, on her wanderings, at Argos, where his tomb was shown in later times.
* Pelasgus, son of Triopas and Sois, and a brother of Iasus, Agenor, and Xanthus. According to Greek legends, he founded the sanctuary of Demeter in Argos and for this reason she was worshipped at this temple under the name Pelasgian Demeter.
*Pelasgus, also known as Gelanor, son of Sthenelas or Arestor.

== Arcadian Pelasgus ==
* Pelasgus, either an autochthon, or a son of Zeus by Niobe (and in the latter case brother of Argus) or of Arestor (son of Iasus or Ecbasus). The Oceanide Meliboea, the nymph Cyllene, or Deianeira, became by him the mother of Lycaon and Temenus. According to Hellenistic version of the myth, Pelasgus coming from Argos, civilized the hitherto savage natives of Arcadia and founded the city of Parrhasia.
* Pelasgus, son of Arcas.

== Thessalian Pelasgoí ==
* Pelasgus, an Argive prince as son of Poseidon and Larissa, daughter of the Pelasgus, son of Triopas. Together with his brothers Phthius and Achaeus, they left Achaean Argos with a Pelasgian contingent for Thessaly. They then established a colony on the said country naming it after themselves: Pelasgiotis, Phthiotis and Achaea. Pelasgus was also the founder of the Thessalian Argos. He was also said to be the father of Phrastor by the nymph Menippe. Pelasgus is also said to have been the ancestor of the Tyrrhenians through the following lineage: Pelasgus - Phrastor - Amyntor - Teutamides - Nanas. In the latter&#x27;s reign, the Pelasgians were believed to have left Greece and to have settled in a new land that later came to be named Tyrrhenia.
*Pelasgus, father of Chlorus and grandfather of Haemon or the father of Haemon and grandfather of Thessalus instead. He may be the same man with the above Pelasgus.

== Homeric Pelasgus ==
*In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer characterizes Pelasgus as brave, and lists the Pelasgians as allies of the Trojans, fighting against the tribes of Greeks in the Trojan War.
* Pelasgus, father of Hippothous, one of the Trojan leaders who fought alongside the Dardanians and other allies defending the walls of the city of Troy. In some accounts Hippothous&#x27; father was called Lethus, son of the above Teutamides.

== Other character ==
* Pelasgus, also called Pelagon, son of the river-god Asopus by the naiad Metope, daughter of the river Ladon. He was brother to Aegina, Salamis, Thebe, Corcyra, Tanagra, Thespia, Cleone, Sinope, Peirene, Asopis, Ornea, Chalcis, Harpina, Ismene, and Ismenus. His sisters were abducted by various gods as punishment for their father&#x27;s deed.

<text>In Greek mythology, Hilaera (Ancient Greek: Ἱλάειρα; also Ilaeira) was a Messenian princess.

== Family ==
Hilaera was a daughter of Leucippus and Philodice, daughter of Inachus. She and her sister Phoebe are commonly referred to as Leucippides (that is, &quot;daughters of Leucippus&quot;). In another account, they were the daughters of Apollo. Hilaera married Castor and bore him a son, named either Anogon or Anaxis.

== Mythology ==
Hilaera and Phoebe were priestesses of Artemis and Athena, and betrothed to Lynceus and Idas, the sons of Aphareus. Castor and Pollux were charmed by their beauty and carried them off. When Idas and Lynceus tried to rescue their brides-to-be they were both slain, but Castor himself fell. Pollux persuaded Zeus to allow him to share his immortality with his brother.

== Cultural depictions ==
Hilaera and Phoebe are both portrayed in the painting &quot;The Rape of the Daughters of Leucippus&quot;.

<text>The ACT (; originally an abbreviation of American College Testing) is a standardized test used for college admissions in the United States. It is administered by ACT, Inc., a for-profit organization of the same name. The ACT test covers four academic skill areas: English, mathematics, reading, and scientific reasoning. It also offers an optional direct writing test. It is accepted by all four-year colleges and universities in the United States as well as more than 225 universities outside of the U.S.

The main four ACT test sections are individually scored on a scale of 1–36, and a composite score (the rounded whole number average of the four sections) is provided.

The ACT was first introduced in November 1959 by University of Iowa professor Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The ACT originally consisted of four tests: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Natural Sciences. In 1989, however, the Social Studies test was changed into a Reading section (which included a social sciences subsection), and the Natural Sciences test was renamed the Science Reasoning test, with more emphasis on problem-solving skills as opposed to memorizing scientific facts. In February 2005, an optional Writing Test was added to the ACT. By the fall of 2017, computer-based ACT tests were available for school-day testing in limited school districts of the US, with greater availability expected in fall of 2018. In July 2024, the ACT announced that the test duration was shortened; the science section, like the writing one, would become optional; and online testing would be rolled out nationally in spring 2025 and for school-day testing in spring 2026.

The ACT has seen a gradual increase in the number of test takers since its inception, and in 2012 the ACT surpassed the SAT for the first time in total test takers; that year, 1,666,017 students took the ACT and 1,664,479 students took the SAT.

==Function==
ACT, Inc., says that the ACT assessment measures high school students&#x27; general educational development and their capability to complete college-level work with the multiple choice tests covering four skill areas: English, mathematics, reading, and science. The optional Writing Test measures skill in planning and writing a short essay. Specifically, ACT states that its scores provide an indicator of &quot;college readiness&quot;, and that scores in each of the subtests correspond to skills in entry-level college courses in English, algebra, social science, humanities, and biology. According to a research study conducted by ACT, Inc. in 2003, there was a relationship between a student&#x27;s ACT composite score and the probability of that student earning a college degree.

To develop the test, ACT incorporates the objectives for instruction from middle and high schools throughout the United States, reviews approved textbooks for subjects taught in Grades 7–12, and surveys educators on which knowledge skills are relevant to success in postsecondary education. ACT publishes a technical manual that summarizes studies conducted on its validity in predicting freshman GPA, equating different high school GPAs, and measuring educational achievement.

Colleges use the ACT and the SAT because there are substantial differences in funding, curricula, grading, and difficulty among U.S. secondary schools due to American federalism, local control, the prevalence of private, distance, homeschooled students, and lack of a rigorous college entrance examination system similar those used in some other countries. ACT scores are used to supplement the secondary school record and help admission officers put local data—such as coursework, grades, and class rank—in a national perspective.

The majority of colleges do not indicate a preference for the SAT or ACT exams and accept both, being treated equally by most admissions officers. According to &quot;Uni in the USA,&quot; colleges that also require students to take the SAT Subject Tests do so regardless of whether the candidate took the SAT or ACT; however, some colleges accept the ACT in place of the SAT subject tests and some accept the optional ACT Writing section in place of an SAT Subject Test.

Most colleges use ACT scores as only one factor in the admission process. A sampling of ACT admissions scores shows that the 75th percentile composite score was 24.1 at public four-year institutions and 25.3 at private four-year institutions.

In addition, some states and individual school districts have used the ACT to assess student learning and/or the performance of schools, requiring all high school students to take the ACT, regardless of whether they are college bound. Colorado and Illinois were the first to incorporate the ACT as part of their mandatory testing program in 2001. Other states followed suit in subsequent years. During the 2018–2019 school year, 13 states will administer the ACT test to all public school 11th graders, and another six states will fund ACT test administration as an option or choice for districts.

While the exact manner in which ACT scores will help to determine admission of a student at American institutions of higher learning is generally a matter decided by the individual institution, some foreign countries have made ACT (and SAT) scores a legal criterion in deciding whether holders of American high school diplomas will be admitted at their public universities.
The ACT is more widely used in the Midwestern, Rocky Mountain, and Southern United States, whereas the SAT is more popular on the East and West coasts. Recently, however, the ACT is being used more on the East Coast. Use of the ACT by colleges has risen as a result of various criticisms of the effectiveness and fairness of the SAT.

==Format==
The required portion of the ACT is divided into four multiple-choice subject tests: English, mathematics, reading, and science reasoning. Subject test scores range from 1 to 36; all scores are integers. The English, mathematics, and reading tests also have subscores ranging from 1 to 18 (the subject score is not the sum of the subscores). In addition, students taking the optional writing test receive a writing score ranging from 2 to 12 (this is a change from the previous 1–36 score range); the writing score does not affect the composite score. Prior to September 2015, there was a Combined English/Writing score, which was a 36-point combination of the 36-point English Test score and the 12-point Writing subscore. The ACT has eliminated the Combined English/writing score and has added two new combined scores: ELA (an average of the English, Reading, and Writing scores) and STEM (an average of the Math and Science scores). These changes for the writing, ELA, and STEM scores were effective starting with the September 2015 test.

Each question answered correctly is worth one raw point, and there is no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice parts of the test; a student can answer all questions without a decrease in their score due to incorrect answers. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.

===English===
The first section is the 45-minute English test covering usage/mechanics, sentence structure, and rhetorical skills. The 75-question test consists of five passages with various sections underlined on one side of the page and options to correct the underlined portions on the other side of the page. Specifically, questions focus on usage and mechanics – issues such as commas, apostrophes, (misplaced/dangling) modifiers, colons, and fragments and run-ons – as well as on rhetorical skills – style (clarity and brevity), strategy, transitions, and organization (sentences in a paragraph and paragraphs in a passage) – and sentence structure – constructing sentences in a stylistically and grammatically correct manner.

===Math===
The second section is a 60-minute, 60-question math test with the usual distribution of questions being approximately 14 covering pre-algebra, 10 elementary algebra, 9 intermediate algebra, 14 plane geometry, 9 coordinate geometry, and 4 elementary trigonometry questions. However, the distribution of question topics varies from test to test. The difficulty of questions usually increases as a test taker moves on to higher question numbers. Calculators are permitted in this section only. The calculator requirements are stricter than the SAT&#x27;s in that computer algebra systems (such as the TI-89) are not allowed; however, the ACT permits calculators with paper tapes, that make noise (but must be disabled), or that have power cords with certain &quot;modifications&quot; (i.e., disabling the mentioned features), which the SAT does not allow. Standard graphing calculators, such as the TI-83 and TI-84, are allowed. Within the TI-Nspire family, the standard and CX versions are allowed while the CX CAS is not. This is the only section that has five answer choices per question instead of four.

===Reading===

The reading section is a 35-minute, 40-question test that consists of four sections, three of which contain one long prose passage and one which contains two shorter prose passages. The passages are representative of the levels and kinds of text commonly encountered in first-year college curriculum. This reading test assesses skills in three general categories: key ideas and details, craft and structure, and integration of knowledge and ideas. Test questions will usually ask students to derive meaning from texts referring to what is explicitly stated or by reasoning to determine implicit meanings. Specifically, questions will ask students to use referring and reasoning skills to determine main ideas; locate and interpret significant details; understand sequences of events; make comparisons; comprehend cause-effect relationships; determine the meaning of context-dependent words, phrases, and statements; draw generalizations; and analyze the author&#x27;s or narrator&#x27;s voice and method.

===Science===
The optional science section is a 35-minute, 40-question test. There are seven passages each followed by five to seven questions. The passages have three different formats: Data Representation, Research Summary, and Conflicting Viewpoints. While the format used to be very predictable (i.e. there were always three Data Representation passages with 5 questions following each, 3 Research Summary passages with six questions each, and one Conflicting Viewpoints passage with 7 questions), when the number of passages was reduced from 7 to 6, more variability in the number of each passage type started to appear. But so far, there is still always only one Conflicting Viewpoints passage. These changes are very recent, and the only reference to them so far is in the recently released practice test on the ACT website.

The science section was mandatory until 2024, when it was made optional with the goal of giving students additional flexibility when taking the ACT exam.

===Writing===
The optional writing section, which is always administered at the end of the test, is 40 minutes (increasing from the original 30-minute time limit on the September 2015 test). While no particular essay structure is required, the essays must be in response to a given prompt; the prompts are about broad social issues (changing from the old prompts which were directly applicable to teenagers), and students must analyze three different perspectives given and show how their opinion relates to these perspectives. The essay does not affect the composite score or the English section score; it is only given as a separate writing score and is included in the ELA score. Two trained readers assign each essay subscores between 1 and 6 in four different categories: Ideas and Analysis, Development and Support, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Scores of 0 are reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a no. 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The subscores from the two different readers are summed to produce final domain scores from 2 to 12 (or 0) in each of the four categories. If the two readers&#x27; subscores differ by more than one point, then a senior third reader makes the final decision on the score. The four domain scores are combined through a process that has not been described to create a writing section score between 1 and 36. Note that the domain scores are not added to create the writing section score.
Although the writing section is optional, many colleges require an essay score and will factor it into the admissions decision (but fewer than half of all colleges have this requirement).

===Averages===

For the &quot;enhanced&quot; version of the ACT introduced in 1989, the mean score of each of the four tests, as well as the mean composite score, was scaled to be 18, with an intended standard error of measurement of 2 for the four test scores and 1 for the composite score. These statistics vary from year to year for current populations of ACT takers.

The chart below summarizes each section and the average test score based on graduating high school seniors in 2024.

===Highest score===

The table below summarizes how many students achieved a composite score of 36 on the ACT between the years of 1997 and 2024.

===College admissions===

The ACT Assessment Student Report, at ACT.org, provides the typical ACT Composite averages for college and universities admission policies. They caution that &quot;because admission policies vary across colleges, the score ranges should be considered rough guidelines.&quot; Following is a list of the average composite scores that typically are accepted at colleges or universities.
* Ivy Caliber (Schools that as a rule of thumb have below a 1 in 8 acceptance rate): scores 32–36
* Highly selective (majority of accepted freshmen in top 10% of high school graduating class): scores 27–31
* Selective (majority of accepted freshmen in top 25% of high school graduating class): scores 24–26
* Traditional (majority of accepted freshmen in top 50% of high school graduating class): scores 21–23
* Liberal (some freshmen from lower half of high school graduating class): scores 18–20
* Open (all high school graduates accepted, to limit of capacity): scores 17–20 Any score is likely accepted.

==Test availability==
The ACT is offered seven times a year in the United States and its territories, Puerto Rico, and Canada: in September, October, December, February, April, June, and July. (In New York State, the test is not offered in July.) In other locations, the ACT is offered five times a year: in September, October, December, April, and June. The ACT is offered only on Saturdays except for those with credible religious obligations, who may take the test on another day.

The ACT is designed, administered, and scored so that there is no advantage to testing on one particular date.

Candidates may choose either the ACT assessment ($63.00), or the ACT assessment plus writing ($88.00). 

Students with verifiable disabilities, including physical and learning disabilities, are eligible to take the test with accommodations. The standard time increase for students requiring additional time due to disabilities is 50%. Originally, the score sheet was labeled that additional time was granted due to a learning disability; however, this was ultimately dropped because it was deemed illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act and could be perceived as an unfair designator of disability.

Scores are sent to the student, their high school, and up to four colleges of the student&#x27;s choice (optional).

==Test section durations==
Time is a major factor to consider in testing.

The ACT is generally regarded as being composed of somewhat easier questions versus the SAT, but the shorter time allotted to complete each section increases difficulty. The ACT allows:
* 45 minutes for a 75-question English section
* 60 minutes for a 60-question Mathematics section
* 35 minutes for a 40-question Reading section
* 35 minutes for a 40-question Science section

Comparatively, the SAT is structured such that the test taker is allowed at least one minute per question, on generally shorter sections (25 or fewer questions). Times may be adjusted as a matter of accommodation for certain disabilities or other impairments.

== National ranks (score cumulative percentages) ==

Score reports provided to students taking the ACT test include the ranks (or cumulative percents) for each score and subscore received by the student. Each rank gives the percentage of recently tested students in the U.S. who scored at or below the given student&#x27;s score. The following table shows the ACT national ranks 

==Concordance of ACT Scores and SAT Scores==

The College Board (the developer of the SAT) and ACT, Inc. compared scores from about 600,000 students who were graduating in 2017 and who took both the SAT (2016 revision) and the ACT in 2016 and 2017. The following table shows, for each ACT composite score in the data set, the corresponding range of SAT total scores for students with the same percentile rank on each test. The most appropriate corresponding SAT score point for the given ACT score is also shown in the table.
==Score cumulative percentages and comparison with pre-2016 SAT==
The data in this section pertains to the SAT prior to the 2016 redesign. Comparisons to SAT scores are not valid after the 2017 graduating class.

Sixty percent—about 2.03 million students—of the 2017 high school graduating class took the ACT. For the graduating class of 2017, the average composite score was a 21.0. Of these test-takers, 46% were male and 52% were female, with 2% not reporting a gender. 2,760 students in the graduating class of 2017 received the highest ACT composite score of 36.
The following chart shows, for each ACT score from 11 to 36, the corresponding ACT percentile and equivalent total SAT score or score range. (Concordance data for ACT scores less than 11 is not yet available for the current version of the SAT.) Note that ACT percentiles are defined as the percentage of test takers scoring at or below the given score.

<doc id="82578" wikidata="Q1136130" url="?curid=82578" title="Idas (son of Aphareus)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Idas (; ), was a Messenian prince. He was one of the Argonauts, a participant in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar and contender with the gods. Idas was described as keen and spirited.

== Family ==
Idas was the son of Aphareus and Arene and the elder brother of Lynceus and Pisus. He was sometimes regarded as the offspring of Poseidon. In some accounts, the wife of Aphareus and thus, Idas&#x27; possible mother was named as Polydora or Laocoosa. By Marpessa, Idas had one daughter named Cleopatra Alcyone who married Meleager.

== Mythology ==

=== Contest for Marpessa&#x27;s hand ===
When Idas came from Messenia to ask for the hand of Marpessa, daughter of Evenus. The maiden&#x27;s father refused his request because he wanted his daughter to remain a virgin. Idas went to his father Poseidon and begged for the use of a winged chariot. Poseidon consented to his use of the chariot, and Idas stole Marpessa away from a band of dancers and fled to Pleuron in Aetolia. Her father, after chasing the couple for a long time and realizing he could not catch up to them, killed his horses and then drowned himself in a nearby river Lycormas and became immortal. The river was named later after him.

Apollo also pursued them in his own chariot, wanting Marpessa for himself.&quot;Idas that was mightiest of men that were then upon the face of earth;&lt;br&gt;who also took his bow to face the king Phoebus Apollo&lt;br&gt;for the sake of the fair-ankled maid [i.e. Marpessa].&quot;As the two fought for the girl&#x27;s hand, Zeus eventually intervened and commanded Marpessa to choose between her mortal lover and the god. Marpessa chose Idas, reasoning to Apollo that had she chosen the god, she would have eventually grown old and lost his affections:
&quot;And thou beautiful god, in that far time,&lt;br&gt;When in thy setting sweet thou gazest down&lt;br&gt;On this grey head, wilt thou remember then&lt;br&gt;That once I pleased thee, that I once was young?&quot;

=== Fight with the Dioscuri ===

==== Hyginus&#x27; version ====
The two beautiful daughters of Leucippus, Phoebe and Hilaeira were promised brides of their cousins, Idas and Lynceus. Because of their beauty, the twins Castor and Pollux who were inflamed with love, carried off the maidens. Trying to recover their lost brides-to-be, the two Messenian princes, took to arms and joined the celebrated fight between them and their rival suitors. During the battle, Castor killed Lynceus while Idas, at his brother&#x27;s death, forgot both the strife and bride, and started to bury his brother. When he was placing the bones in a funeral monument, Castor intervened and tried to prevent his raising of the monument, because he had won over him as if he were a woman. In anger, Idas pierced the thigh of Castor with the sword he wore. Others say that, as he was building the monument he pushed it on Castor and thus killed him. When they reported this to Pollux, he rushed up and overcame Idas in a single fight, recovered the body of his brother, and buried it.

==== Apollodorus&#x27; version ====
A different tale was presented in the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, where the cause of the strife of the Aphareids and Disocuri was not the abduction of the Leucippides but the division of spoils between them. Castor and Pollux, having driven booty of cattle from Arcadia, in company with Idas and Lynceus, they allowed Idas to divide the spoil. He cut a cow in four and declared that whoever ate his portion of the cow first would have half the spoil, whereas the other half would go to the one who finished his portion second. Idas quickly devoured his own chunk, and then grabbed Lynceus&#x27;s portion and ate that as well. As the first and second portions to be finished belong to the two Messenians, Idas and Lynceus took the cattle with them to Messene. The Dioscuri however, feeling cheated out, marched against Messene, and took the cattle back. As they lay in wait for Idas and Lynceus, Lynceus spied Castor and informed Idas, who killed Castor. Pollux then chased them and slew Lynceus by throwing his spear, but was himself hit in the head with a stone by Lynceus. In revenge, the divine father of Pollux, Zeus, smote Idas with a thunderbolt and carried up his son to the heavens above where he shared his immortality with his mortal brother.

After the deaths of the two Messenian princes, the kingdom was bereft of male descendants and thus, Nestor, son of Neleus and a relative obtained the whole land including all the part ruled formerly by Idas, but not that subject (Tricca) to the sons of Asclepius, Machaon and Podalirius.

=== Other adventures ===
Idas wished to rob Teuthras, king of Moesia, of his kingdom but was overcame in one battle by Telephus, son of Auge and Heracles, with the help of Parthenopaeus, son of Atalanta.

On their journey to fetch the Golden Fleece, Idas avenged the death of Idmon, son of Apollo by slaying the wild boar that wounded and killed the seer.

<text>In Greek mythology, Leucippe ( means &#x27;white horse&#x27;) is the name of the following individuals:

*Leucippe, one of the 3,000 Oceanids, water-nymph daughters of the Titans Oceanus and his sister-spouse Tethys. Leucippe, along with her sisters, was one of the companions of Persephone when the maiden was abducted by Hades, the god of the Underworld.
*Leucippe, one of the Minyades, daughter of King Minyas of Orchomenus.
*Leucippe, the wife of King Thestius of Pleuron and mother of Iphiclus and Althaea.
*Leucippe, a queen of Troy as the wife of Ilus, founder of Ilium. By him, she became the mother of Laomedon and possibly, Themiste, Telecleia and Tithonus. In some accounts, the wife of Ilus was called Eurydice, daughter of Adrastus or Batia, daughter of Teucer.
*Leucippe, another Trojan queen as the wife of King Laomedon. According to the mythographer Apollodorus, she and Laomedon had five sons, Tithonus, Lampus, Clytius, Hicetaon, and Priam, and three daughters, Hesione, Cilla and Astyoche. Otherwise the wife of Laomedon was identified as Strymo, daughter of Scamander or Placia, daughter of Otreus or Zeuxippe.
*Leucippe, a daughter of Thestor and possibly Polymele, and thus, sister of Theonoe, Calchas and Theoclymenus. She became a priestess of Apollo and went from country to country in search of her father, Thestor and sister Theonoe who was stolen by pirates.
*Leucippe, mother of Egyptian king, Aegyptus by Hephaestus.
*Leucippe, mother of Teuthras the Mysian king. Her son killed a sacred boar of Artemis during hunt and was driven mad by the angry goddess. Lysippe then went out in the woods, seeking to find out what had happened to her son. Eventually she learned about the goddess&#x27; wrath from the seer Polyidus; she then sacrificed to the goddess to propitiate her, and Teuthras&#x27; sanity was restored.
*Leucippe, the wife of Euenor and mother of Cleito in Plato&#x27; s legend of Atlantis.
*Leucippe, the heroine of &quot;The Adventures of Leucippe and Cleitophon&quot; by Achilles Tatius

<doc id="82583" wikidata="Q4353903" url="?curid=82583" title="Golden Age of Radio">
<text>The Golden Age of Radio, also known as the old-time radio (OTR) era, was an era of radio in the United States where it was the dominant electronic home entertainment medium. It began with the birth of commercial radio broadcasting in the early 1920s and lasted through the 1950s, when television gradually superseded radio as the medium of choice for scripted programming, variety and dramatic shows.

Radio was the first broadcast medium, and during this period people regularly tuned in to their favorite radio programs, and families gathered to listen to the home radio in the evening. According to a 1947 C. E. Hooper survey, 82 out of 100 Americans were found to be radio listeners. A variety of new entertainment formats and genres were created for the new medium, many of which later migrated to television: radio plays, mystery serials, soap operas, quiz shows, talent shows, daytime and evening variety hours, situation comedies, play-by-play sports, children&#x27;s shows, cooking shows, and more.

In the 1950s, television surpassed radio as the most popular broadcast medium, and commercial radio programming shifted to narrower formats of news, talk, sports and music. Religious broadcasters, listener-supported public radio and college stations provide their own distinctive formats.

==Origins==
During the first three decades of radio, from 1887 to about 1920, the technology of transmitting sound was undeveloped; the information-carrying ability of radio waves was the same as a telegraph; the radio signal could be either on or off. Radio communication was by wireless telegraphy; at the sending end, an operator tapped on a switch which caused the radio transmitter to produce a series of pulses of radio waves which spelled out text messages in Morse code. At the receiver these sounded like beeps, requiring an operator who knew Morse code to translate them back to text. This type of radio was used exclusively for person-to-person text communication for commercial, diplomatic and military purposes and hobbyists; broadcasting did not exist.

The broadcasts of live drama, comedy, music and news that characterize the Golden Age of Radio had a precedent in the Théâtrophone, commercially introduced in Paris in 1890 and available as late as 1932. It allowed subscribers to eavesdrop on live stage performances and hear news reports by means of a network of telephone lines. The development of radio eliminated the wires and subscription charges from this concept.

Between 1900 and 1920 the first technology for transmitting sound by radio was developed, AM (amplitude modulation), and AM broadcasting sprang up around 1920.

On Christmas Eve 1906, Reginald Fessenden is said to have broadcast the first radio program, consisting of some violin playing and passages from the Bible. While Fessenden&#x27;s role as an inventor and early radio experimenter is not in dispute, several contemporary radio researchers have questioned whether the Christmas Eve broadcast took place, or whether the date was, in fact, several weeks earlier. The first apparent published reference to the event was made in 1928 by H. P. Davis, Vice President of Westinghouse, in a lecture given at Harvard University. In 1932 Fessenden cited the Christmas Eve 1906 broadcast event in a letter he wrote to Vice President S. M. Kinter of Westinghouse. Fessenden&#x27;s wife Helen recounts the broadcast in her book &quot;Fessenden: Builder of Tomorrows&quot; (1940), eight years after Fessenden&#x27;s death. The issue of whether the 1906 Fessenden broadcast actually happened is discussed in Donna Halper&#x27;s article &quot;In Search of the Truth About Fessenden&quot; and also in James O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s essays. An annotated argument supporting Fessenden as the world&#x27;s first radio broadcaster was offered in 2006 by Dr. John S. Belrose, Radioscientist Emeritus at the Communications Research Centre Canada, in his essay &quot;Fessenden&#x27;s 1906 Christmas Eve broadcast.&quot;

It was not until after the &quot;Titanic&quot; catastrophe in 1912 that radio for mass communication came into vogue, inspired first by the work of amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) radio operators. Radio was especially important during World War I as it was vital for air and naval operations. World War I brought about major developments in radio, superseding the Morse code of the wireless telegraph with the vocal communication of the wireless telephone, through advancements in vacuum tube technology and the introduction of the transceiver.

After the war, numerous radio stations were born in the United States and set the standard for later radio programs. The first radio news program was broadcast on August 31, 1920, on the station 8MK in Detroit; owned by &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, the station covered local election results. This was followed in 1920 with the first commercial radio station in the United States, KDKA, being established in Pittsburgh. The first regular entertainment programs were broadcast in 1922, and on March 10, &quot;Variety&quot; carried the front-page headline: &quot;Radio Sweeping Country: 1,000,000 Sets in Use.&quot; A highlight of this time was the first Rose Bowl being broadcast on January 1, 1923, on the Los Angeles station KHJ.

== Growth of radio ==
Broadcast radio in the United States underwent a period of rapid change through the decade of the 1920s. Technology advances, better regulation, rapid consumer adoption, and the creation of broadcast networks transformed radio from a consumer curiosity into the mass media powerhouse that defined the Golden Age of Radio.

=== Consumer adoption ===
Through the decade of the 1920s, the purchase of radios by United States homes continued, and accelerated. The Radio Corporation of America (RCA) released figures in 1925 stating that 19% of United States homes owned a radio. The triode and regenerative circuit made amplified, vacuum tube radios widely available to consumers by the second half of the 1920s. The advantage was obvious: several people at once in a home could now easily listen to their radio at the same time. In 1930, 40% of the nation&#x27;s households owned a radio, a figure that was much higher in suburban and large metropolitan areas. The superheterodyne receiver and other inventions refined radios even further in the next decade; even as the Great Depression ravaged the country in the 1930s, radio would stay at the center of American life. 83% of American homes would own a radio by 1940.

===Government regulation===
Although radio was well established with United States consumers by the mid-1920s, regulation of the broadcast medium presented its own challenges. Until 1926, broadcast radio power and frequency use was regulated by the U.S. Department of Commerce, until a legal challenge rendered the agency powerless to do so. Congress responded by enacting the Radio Act of 1927, which included the formation of the Federal Radio Commission (FRC).

One of the FRC&#x27;s most important early actions was the adoption of General Order 40, which divided stations on the AM band into three power level categories, which became known as Local, Regional, and Clear Channel, and reorganized station assignments. Based on this plan, effective 3:00 a.m. Eastern time on November 11, 1928, most of the country&#x27;s stations were assigned to new transmitting frequencies.

=== Broadcast networks ===
The final element needed to make the Golden Age of Radio possible focused on the question of distribution: the ability for multiple radio stations to simultaneously broadcast the same content, and this would be solved with the concept of a radio network. The earliest radio programs of the 1920s were largely unsponsored; radio stations were a service designed to sell radio receivers. In early 1922, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) announced the beginning of advertisement-supported broadcasting on its owned stations, and plans for the development of the first radio network using its telephone lines to transmit the content. In July 1926, AT&amp;T abruptly decided to exit the broadcasting field, and signed an agreement to sell its entire network operations to a group headed by RCA, which used the assets to form the National Broadcasting Company. Four national radio networks had formed by 1934. These were:
* National Broadcasting Company Red Network (NBC Red), launched November 15, 1926. Originally founded as the National Broadcasting Company in late 1926, the company was almost immediately forced to split under antitrust laws to form NBC Red and NBC Blue. When, in 1942, NBC Blue was sold and renamed the Blue Network, this network would go back to calling itself simply the National Broadcasting Company Radio Network (NBC).
* National Broadcasting Company Blue Network (NBC Blue); launched January 10, 1927, split from NBC Red. NBC Blue was sold in 1942 and became the Blue Network, and it in turn transferred its assets to a new company, the American Broadcasting Company on June 15, 1945. That network identified itself as the American Broadcasting Company Radio Network (ABC).
* Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), launched September 18, 1927. After an initially struggling attempt to compete with the NBC networks, CBS gained new momentum when William S. Paley was installed as company president.
* Mutual Broadcasting System (Mutual), launched September 29, 1934. Mutual was initially run as a cooperative in which the flagship stations owned the network, not the other way around as was the case with the other three radio networks.

However, by the end of the Golden Age (around 1950), two other national radio networks were in operation alongside the larger four:
* Liberty Broadcasting System (Liberty), launched in 1948. Liberty was founded by American radio broadcaster Gordon McLendon, and broadcast live recreations of Major League Baseball games by following the action via Western Union ticker reports.
* Progressive Broadcasting System (PBS), launched September 4, 1950. PBS&#x27;s goal was to cater to smaller radio stations that hadn&#x27;t yet affiliated with NBC, CBS, ABC, or even Mutual or Liberty. It planned to offer programming for 10 hours of the day on member stations.

==Programming==
In the period before and after the advent of the broadcast network, new forms of entertainment needed to be created to fill the time of a station&#x27;s broadcast day. Many of the formats born in this era continued into the television and digital eras. In the beginning of the Golden Age, network programs were almost exclusively broadcast live, as the national networks prohibited the airing of recorded programs until the late 1940s because of the inferior sound quality of phonograph discs, the only practical recording medium at that time. As a result, network prime-time shows would be performed twice, once for each coast.

=== Live events ===
Coverage of live events included musical concerts and play-by-play sports broadcasts.

=== News ===
The capability of the new medium to get information to people created the format of modern radio news: headlines, remote reporting, sidewalk interviews (such as &quot;Vox Pop&quot;), panel discussions, weather reports, and farm reports. The entry of radio into the realm of news triggered a feud between the radio and newspaper industries in the mid-1930s, eventually culminating in newspapers trumping up exaggerated reports of a mass hysteria from the (entirely fictional) radio presentation of &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, which had been presented as a faux newscast.

=== Musical features ===
The sponsored musical feature soon became one of the most popular program formats. Most early radio sponsorship came in the form of selling the naming rights to the program, as evidenced by such programs as &quot;The A&amp;P Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Champion Spark Plug Hour&quot;, &quot;The Clicquot Club Eskimos&quot;, and &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot;; commercials, as they are known in the modern era, were still relatively uncommon and considered intrusive. During the 1930s and 1940s, the leading orchestras were heard often through big band remotes, and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot; continued such remotes well into the 1950s by broadcasting live music from New York City jazz clubs to rural America. Singers such as Harriet Lee and Wendell Hall became popular fixtures on network radio beginning in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Local stations often had staff organists such as Jesse Crawford playing popular tunes.

Classical music programs on the air included &quot;The Voice of Firestone&quot; and &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;. Texaco sponsored the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts; the broadcasts, now sponsored by the Toll Brothers, continue to this day around the world, and are one of the few examples of live classical music still broadcast on radio. One of the most notable of all classical music radio programs of the Golden Age of Radio featured the celebrated Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini conducting the NBC Symphony Orchestra, which had been created especially for him. At that time, nearly all classical musicians and critics considered Toscanini the greatest living maestro. Popular songwriters such as George Gershwin were also featured on radio. (Gershwin, in addition to frequent appearances as a guest, had his own program in 1934.) The New York Philharmonic also had weekly concerts on radio. There was no dedicated classical music radio station like NPR at that time, so classical music programs had to share the network they were broadcast on with more popular ones, much as in the days of television before the creation of NET and PBS.

Country music also enjoyed popularity. &quot;National Barn Dance&quot;, begun on Chicago&#x27;s WLS in 1924, was picked up by NBC Radio in 1933. In 1925, &quot;WSM Barn Dance&quot; went on the air from Nashville. It was renamed the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in 1927 and NBC carried portions from 1944 to 1956. NBC also aired &quot;The Red Foley Show&quot; from 1951 to 1961, and ABC Radio carried &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; from 1953 to 1961.

=== Comedy ===
Radio attracted top comedy talents from vaudeville and Hollywood for many years: Bing Crosby, Abbott and Costello, Fred Allen, Jack Benny, Victor Borge, Fanny Brice, Billie Burke, Bob Burns, Judy Canova, Eddie Cantor, Jimmy Durante, &quot;Burns and Allen&quot;, Phil Harris, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Groucho Marx, Jean Shepherd, Red Skelton and Ed Wynn. Situational comedies also gained popularity, such as &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, &quot;Easy Aces&quot;, &quot;Ethel and Albert&quot;, &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;, &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;, &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot; (which featured screen star Ronald Colman and his wife Benita Hume), &quot;Meet Corliss Archer&quot;, &quot;Meet Millie&quot;, and &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;.

Radio comedy ran the gamut from the small town humor of Lum and Abner, Herb Shriner and Minnie Pearl to the dialect characterizations of Mel Blanc and the caustic sarcasm of Henry Morgan. Gags galore were delivered weekly on &quot;Stop Me If You&#x27;ve Heard This One&quot; and &quot;Can You Top This?&quot;, panel programs devoted to the art of telling jokes. Quiz shows were lampooned on &quot;It Pays to Be Ignorant&quot;, and other memorable parodies were presented by such satirists as Spike Jones, Stoopnagle and Budd, Stan Freberg and Bob and Ray. British comedy reached American shores in a major assault when NBC carried &quot;The Goon Show&quot; in the mid-1950s.
Some shows originated as stage productions: Clifford Goldsmith&#x27;s play &quot;What a Life&quot; was reworked into NBC&#x27;s popular, long-running &quot;The Aldrich Family&quot; (1939–1953) with the familiar catchphrases &quot;Henry! Henry Aldrich!,&quot; followed by Henry&#x27;s answer, &quot;Coming, Mother!&quot; Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway hit, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; (1936), became a weekly situation comedy heard on Mutual (1944) with Everett Sloane and later on NBC (1951) with Walter Brennan.

Other shows were adapted from comic strips, such as &quot;Blondie&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, &quot;The Gumps&quot;, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot;, &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;, &quot;Red Ryder&quot;, &quot;Reg&#x27;lar Fellers&quot;, &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; and &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot;. Bob Montana&#x27;s redheaded teen of comic strips and comic books was heard on radio&#x27;s &quot;Archie Andrews&quot; from 1943 to 1953. &quot;The Timid Soul&quot; was a 1941–1942 comedy based on cartoonist H. T. Webster&#x27;s famed Caspar Milquetoast character, and Robert L. Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not! was adapted to several different radio formats during the 1930s and 1940s. Conversely, some radio shows gave rise to spinoff comic strips, such as &quot;My Friend Irma&quot; starring Marie Wilson.

=== Soap operas ===
The first program generally considered to be a daytime serial drama by scholars of the genre is &quot;Painted Dreams,&quot; which premiered on WGN on October 20, 1930. The first networked daytime serial is &quot;Clara, Lu, &#x27;n Em&quot;, which started in a daytime time slot on February 15, 1932. As daytime serials became popular in the early 1930s, they became known as soap operas because many were sponsored by soap products and detergents. On November 25, 1960, the last four daytime radio dramas—&quot;Young Dr. Malone&quot;, &quot;Right to Happiness&quot;, &quot;The Second Mrs. Burton&quot; and &quot;Ma Perkins&quot;, all broadcast on the CBS Radio Network—were brought to an end.

=== Children&#x27;s programming ===
The line-up of late afternoon adventure serials included &quot;Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders&quot;, &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot;, &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot;, &quot;Captain Midnight&quot;, and &quot;The Tom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters&quot;. Badges, rings, decoding devices and other radio premiums were often linked to a sponsor&#x27;s product. These items were offered on adventure shows. Young listeners had to mail in a boxtop from a breakfast cereal or other proof of purchase.

=== Radio plays ===
Radio plays were presented on such programs as &quot;26 by Corwin&quot;, &quot;NBC Short Story&quot;, &quot;Arch Oboler&#x27;s Plays&quot;, &quot;Quiet, Please&quot;, and &quot;CBS Radio Workshop&quot;. Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot; and &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot; were considered by many critics to be the finest radio drama anthologies ever presented. They usually starred Welles in the leading role, along with celebrity guest stars such as Margaret Sullavan or Helen Hayes, in adaptations from literature, Broadway, and/or films. They included such titles as &quot;Liliom&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (a title now feared lost), &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, and &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;. It was on &quot;Mercury Theatre&quot; that Welles presented his celebrated-but-infamous 1938 adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, formatted to sound like a breaking news program. &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; presented adaptations of classical and Broadway plays. Their Shakespeare adaptations included a one-hour &quot;Macbeth&quot; starring Maurice Evans and Judith Anderson, and a 90-minute &quot;Hamlet&quot;, starring John Gielgud. Recordings of many of these programs survive.

During the 1940s, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, famous for playing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in films, repeated their characterizations on radio on &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which featured both original stories and episodes directly adapted from Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s stories. None of the episodes in which Rathbone and Bruce starred on the radio program were filmed with the two actors as Holmes and Watson, so radio became the only medium in which audiences were able to experience Rathbone and Bruce appearing in some of the more famous Holmes stories, such as &quot;The Speckled Band&quot;. There were also many dramatizations of Sherlock Holmes stories on radio without Rathbone and Bruce.

During the latter part of his career, celebrated actor John Barrymore starred in a radio program, &quot;Streamlined Shakespeare&quot;, which featured him in a series of one-hour adaptations of Shakespeare plays, many of which Barrymore never appeared in either on stage or in films, such as &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; (in which he played both Malvolio and Sir Toby Belch), and &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

&quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; presented adaptations of Hollywood movies, performed before a live audience, usually with cast members from the original films. &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Escape&quot;, &quot;The Mysterious Traveler&quot; and &quot;Inner Sanctum Mystery&quot; were popular thriller anthology series. Leading writers who created original material for radio included Norman Corwin, Carlton E. Morse, David Goodis, Archibald MacLeish, Arthur Miller, Arch Oboler, Wyllis Cooper, Rod Serling, Jay Bennett, and Irwin Shaw.

=== Game shows ===
Game shows saw their beginnings in radio. One of the first was &quot;Information Please&quot; in 1938, and one of the first major successes was &quot;Dr. I.Q.&quot; in 1939. &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, which premiered in 1946, was the first to use lockout devices and feature returning champions.

A relative of the game show, which would be called the giveaway show in contemporary media, typically involved giving sponsored products to studio audience members, people randomly called by telephone, or both. An early example of this show was the 1939 show &quot;Pot o&#x27; Gold&quot;, but the breakout hit of this type was ABC&#x27;s &quot;Stop the Music&quot; in 1948. Winning a prize generally required knowledge of what was being aired on the show at that moment, which led to criticism of the giveaway show as a form of &quot;buying an audience&quot;. Giveaway shows were extremely popular through 1948 and 1949. They were often panned as low-brow, and an unsuccessful attempt was even made by the FCC to ban them (as an illegal lottery) in August 1949.

==Broadcast production methods==
The RCA Type 44-BX microphone had two live faces and two dead ones. Thus actors could face each other and react. An actor could give the effect of leaving the room by simply moving their head toward the dead face of the microphone.

The scripts were paper-clipped together. It has been disputed whether or not actors and actresses would drop finished pages to the carpeted floor after use.

==History of professional radio recordings in the United States==

===Radio stations===
Despite a general ban on use of recordings on broadcasts by radio networks through the late 1940s, &quot;reference recordings&quot; on phonograph disc were made of many programs as they were being broadcast, for review by the sponsor and for the network&#x27;s own archival purposes. With the development of high-fidelity magnetic wire and tape recording in the years following World War II, the networks became more open to airing recorded programs and the prerecording of shows became more common.

Local stations, however, had always been free to use recordings and sometimes made substantial use of prerecorded syndicated programs distributed on pressed (as opposed to individually recorded) transcription discs.

Recording was done using a cutting lathe and acetate discs. Programs were normally recorded at 33 rpm on 16-inch discs, the standard format used for such &quot;electrical transcriptions&quot; from the early 1930s through the 1950s. Sometimes, the groove was cut starting at the inside of the disc and running to the outside. This was useful when the program to be recorded was longer than 15 minutes so required more than one disc side. By recording the first side outside in, the second inside out, and so on, the sound quality at the disc change-over points would match and result in a more seamless playback. An inside start also had the advantage that the thread of material cut from the disc&#x27;s surface, which had to be kept out of the path of the cutting stylus, was naturally thrown toward the center of the disc so was automatically out of the way. When cutting an outside start disc, a brush could be used to keep it out of the way by sweeping it toward the middle of the disc. Well-equipped recording lathes used the vacuum from a water aspirator to pick it up as it was cut and deposit it in a water-filled bottle. In addition to convenience, this served a safety purpose, as the cellulose nitrate thread was highly flammable and a loose accumulation of it combusted violently if ignited.

Most recordings of radio broadcasts were made at a radio network&#x27;s studios, or at the facilities of a network-owned or affiliated station, which might have four or more lathes. A small local station often had none. Two lathes were required to capture a program longer than 15 minutes without losing parts of it while discs were flipped over or changed, along with a trained technician to operate them and monitor the recording while it was being made. However, some surviving recordings were produced by local stations.

When a substantial number of copies of an electrical transcription were required, as for the distribution of a syndicated program, they were produced by the same process used to make ordinary records. A master recording was cut, then electroplated to produce a stamper from which pressings in vinyl (or, in the case of transcription discs pressed before about 1935, shellac) were molded in a record press.

===Armed Forces Radio Service===
The Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) had its origins in the U.S. War Department&#x27;s quest to improve troop morale. This quest began with short-wave broadcasts of educational and information programs to troops in 1940. In 1941, the War Department began issuing &quot;Buddy Kits&quot; (B-Kits) to departing troops, which consisted of radios, 78 rpm records and electrical transcription discs of radio shows. However, with the entrance of the United States into World War II, the War Department decided that it needed to improve the quality and quantity of its offerings.

This began with the broadcasting of its own original variety programs. &quot;Command Performance&quot; was the first of these, produced for the first time on March 1, 1942. On May 26, 1942, the Armed Forces Radio Service was formally established. Originally, its programming comprised network radio shows with the commercials removed. However, it soon began producing original programming, such as &quot;Mail Call&quot;, &quot;G.I. Journal&quot;, &quot;Jubilee&quot; and &quot;GI Jive&quot;. At its peak in 1945, the Service produced around 20 hours of original programming each week.

From 1943 until 1949 the AFRS also broadcast programs developed through the collaborative efforts of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the Columbia Broadcasting System in support of America&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives and President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy. Included among the popular shows was &quot;Viva America&quot; which showcased leading musical artists from both North and South America for the entertainment of America&#x27;s troops. Included among the regular performers were: Alfredo Antonini, Juan Arvizu, Nestor Mesta Chayres, Kate Smith, and John Serry Sr.

After the war, the AFRS continued providing programming to troops in Europe. During the 1950s and early 1960s it presented performances by the Army&#x27;s only symphonic orchestra ensemble—the Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra.
It also provided programming for future wars that the United States was involved in. It survives today as a component of the American Forces Network (AFN).

All of the shows aired by the AFRS during the Golden Age were recorded as electrical transcription discs, vinyl copies of which were shipped to stations overseas to be broadcast to the troops. People in the United States rarely ever heard programming from the AFRS, though AFRS recordings of Golden Age network shows were occasionally broadcast on some domestic stations beginning in the 1950s.

In some cases, the AFRS disc is the only surviving recording of a program.

===Home radio recordings in the United States===
There was some home recording of radio broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s. Examples from as early as 1930 have been documented. During these years, home recordings were made with disc recorders, most of which were only capable of storing about four minutes of a radio program on each side of a twelve-inch 78 rpm record. Most home recordings were made on even shorter-playing ten-inch or smaller discs. Some home disc recorders offered the option of the 33 rpm speed used for electrical transcriptions, allowing a recording more than twice as long to be made, although with reduced audio quality. Office dictation equipment was sometimes pressed into service for making recordings of radio broadcasts, but the audio quality of these devices was poor and the resulting recordings were in odd formats that had to be played back on similar equipment. Due to the expense of recorders and the limitations of the recording media, home recording of broadcasts was not common during this period and it was usually limited to brief excerpts.

The lack of suitable home recording equipment was somewhat relieved in 1947 with the availability of magnetic wire recorders for domestic use. These were capable of recording an hour-long broadcast on a single small spool of wire, and if a high-quality radio&#x27;s audio output was recorded directly, rather than by holding a microphone up to its speaker, the recorded sound quality was very good. However, because the wire cost money and, like magnetic tape, could be repeatedly re-used to make new recordings, only a few complete broadcasts appear to have survived on this medium. In fact, there was little home recording of complete radio programs until the early 1950s, when increasingly affordable reel-to-reel tape recorders for home use were introduced to the market.

==Recording media==

===Electrical transcription discs===
Before the early 1950s, when radio networks and local stations wanted to preserve a live broadcast, they did so by means of special phonograph records known as &quot;electrical transcriptions&quot; (ETs), made by cutting a sound-modulated groove into a blank disc. At first, in the early 1930s, the blanks varied in both size and composition, but most often they were simply bare aluminum and the groove was indented rather than cut. Typically, these very early recordings were not made by the network or radio station, but by a private recording service contracted by the broadcast sponsor or one of the performers. The bare aluminum discs were typically 10 or 12 inches in diameter and recorded at the then-standard speed of 78 rpm, which meant that several disc sides were required to accommodate even a 15-minute program. By about 1936, 16-inch aluminum-based discs coated with cellulose nitrate lacquer, commonly known as acetates and recorded at a speed of 33 rpm, had been adopted by the networks and individual radio stations as the standard medium for recording broadcasts. The making of such recordings, at least for some purposes, then became routine. Some discs were recorded using a &quot;hill and dale&quot; vertically modulated groove, rather than the &quot;lateral&quot; side-to-side modulation found on the records being made for home use at that time. The large slow-speed discs could easily contain fifteen minutes on each side, allowing an hour-long program to be recorded on only two discs. The lacquer was softer than shellac or vinyl and wore more rapidly, allowing only a few playbacks with the heavy pickups and steel needles then in use before deterioration became audible.

During World War II, aluminum became a necessary material for the war effort and was in short supply. This caused an alternative to be sought for the base on which to coat the lacquer. Glass, despite its obvious disadvantage of fragility, had occasionally been used in earlier years because it could provide a perfectly smooth and even supporting surface for mastering and other critical applications. Glass base recording blanks came into general use for the duration of the war.

===Magnetic wire recording===
In the late 1940s, wire recorders became a readily obtainable means of recording radio programs. On a per-minute basis, it was less expensive to record a broadcast on wire than on discs. The one-hour program that required the four sides of two 16-inch discs could be recorded intact on a single spool of wire less than three inches in diameter and about half an inch thick. The audio fidelity of a good wire recording was comparable to acetate discs and by comparison the wire was practically indestructible, but it was soon rendered obsolete by the more manageable and easily edited medium of magnetic tape.

===Reel-to-reel tape recording===
Bing Crosby became the first major proponent of magnetic tape recording for radio, and he was the first to use it on network radio, after he did a demonstration program in 1947. Tape had several advantages over earlier recording methods. Running at a sufficiently high speed, it could achieve higher fidelity than both electrical transcription discs and magnetic wire. Discs could be edited only by copying parts of them to a new disc, and the copying entailed a loss of audio quality. Wire could be divided up and the ends spliced together by knotting, but wire was difficult to handle and the crude splices were too noticeable. Tape could be edited by cutting it with a blade and neatly joining ends together with adhesive tape. By early 1949, the transition from live performances preserved on discs to performances prerecorded on magnetic tape for later broadcast was complete for network radio programs. However, for the physical distribution of prerecorded programming to individual stations, 16-inch 33 rpm vinyl pressings, less expensive to produce in quantities of identical copies than tapes, continued to be standard throughout the 1950s.

==Availability of recordings==
The great majority of pre-World War II live radio broadcasts are lost. Many were never recorded; few recordings predate the early 1930s. Beginning then several of the longer-running radio dramas have their archives complete or nearly complete. The earlier the date, the less likely it is that a recording survives. However, a good number of syndicated programs from this period have survived because copies were distributed far and wide. Recordings of live network broadcasts from the World War II years were preserved in the form of pressed vinyl copies issued by the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) and survive in relative abundance. Syndicated programs from World War II and later years have nearly all survived. The survival of network programming from this time frame is more inconsistent; the networks started prerecording their formerly live shows on magnetic tape for subsequent network broadcast, but did not physically distribute copies, and the expensive tapes, unlike electrical transcription (&quot;ET&quot;) discs, could be &quot;wiped&quot; and re-used (especially since, in the age of emerging trends such as television and music radio, such recordings were believed to have virtually no rerun or resale value). Thus, while some prime time network radio series from this era exist in full or almost in full, especially the most famous and longest-lived of them, less prominent or shorter-lived series (such as serials) may have only a handful of extant episodes. Airchecks, off-the-air recordings of complete shows made by, or at the behest of, individuals for their own private use, sometimes help to fill in such gaps. The contents of privately made recordings of live broadcasts from the first half of the 1930s can be of particular interest, as little live material from that period survives. Unfortunately, the sound quality of very early private recordings is often very poor, although in some cases this is largely due to the use of an incorrect playback stylus, which can also badly damage some unusual types of discs.

Most of the Golden Age programs in circulation among collectors—whether on analog tape, CD, or in the form of MP3s—originated from analog 16-inch transcription disc, although some are off-the-air AM recordings. But in many cases, the circulating recordings are corrupted (decreased in quality), because lossless digital recording for the home market did not come until the very end of the twentieth century.

Collectors made and shared recordings on analog magnetic tapes, the only practical, relatively inexpensive medium, first on reels, then cassettes. &quot;Sharing&quot; usually meant making a duplicate tape. They connected two recorders, playing on one and recording on the other. Analog recordings are never perfect, and copying an analog recording multiplies the imperfections. With the oldest recordings this can even mean it went out the speaker of one machine and in via the microphone of the other. The muffled sound, dropouts, sudden changes in sound quality, unsteady pitch, and other defects heard all too often are almost always accumulated tape copy defects. In addition, magnetic recordings, unless preserved archivally, are gradually damaged by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

The audio quality of the source discs, when they have survived unscathed and are accessed and dubbed anew, is usually found to be reasonably clear and undistorted, sometimes startlingly good, although like all phonograph records they are vulnerable to wear and the effects of scuffs, scratches, and ground-in dust. Many shows from the 1940s have survived only in edited AFRS versions, although some exist in both the original and AFRS forms.

, the Old Time Radio collection at the Internet Archive contains 5,121 recordings. An active group of collectors makes digitally available, via CD or download, large collections of programs. RadioEchoes.com offers 98,949 episodes in their collection, but not all is old-time radio.

===Copyright status===
Unlike film, television, and print items from the era, the copyright status of most recordings from the Golden Age of Radio is unclear. This is because, before 1972, the United States delegated the copyrighting of sound recordings to the individual states, many of which offered more generous common law copyright protections than the federal government offered for other media (some offered &quot;perpetual&quot; copyright, which has since been abolished; under the Music Modernization Act of September 2018, any sound recording 95 years old or older will be thrust into the public domain regardless of state law). The only exceptions are AFRS original productions, which are considered work of the United States government and thus both ineligible for federal copyright and outside the jurisdiction of any state; these programs are firmly in the public domain (this does not apply to programs carried by AFRS but produced by commercial networks).

In practice, most old-time radio recordings are treated as orphan works: although there may still be a valid copyright on the program, it is seldom enforced. The copyright on an individual sound recording is distinct from the federal copyright for the underlying material (such as a published script, music, or in the case of adaptations, the original film or television material), and in many cases it is impossible to determine where or when the original recording was made or if the recording was copyrighted in that state. The U.S. Copyright Office states &quot;there are a variety of legal regimes governing protection of pre-1972 sound recordings in the various states, and the scope of protection and of exceptions and limitations to that protection is unclear.&quot; For example, New York has issued contradicting rulings on whether or not common law exists in that state; the most recent ruling, 2016&#x27;s &quot;Flo &amp; Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio&quot;, holds that there is no such copyright in New York in regard to public performance. Further complicating matters is that certain examples in case law have implied that radio broadcasts (and faithful reproductions thereof), because they were distributed freely to the public over the air, may not be eligible for copyright in and of themselves. The Internet Archive and other organizations that distribute public domain and open-source audio recordings maintain extensive archives of old-time radio programs.

== Legacy ==
===United States===
Some old-time radio shows continued on the air, although in ever-dwindling numbers, throughout the 1950s, even after their television equivalents had conquered the general public. One factor which helped to kill off old-time radio entirely was the evolution of popular music (including the development of rock and roll), which led to the birth of the top 40 radio format. A top 40 show could be produced in a small studio in a local station with minimal staff. This displaced full-service network radio and hastened the end of the golden-age era of radio drama by 1962. (Radio as a broadcast medium would survive, thanks in part to the proliferation of the transistor radio, and permanent installation in vehicles, making the medium far more portable than television). Full-service stations that did not adopt either top 40 or the mellower beautiful music or MOR formats eventually developed all-news radio in the mid-1960s.

Scripted radio comedy and drama in the vein of old-time radio has a limited presence on U.S. radio. Several radio theatre series are still in production in the United States, usually airing on Sunday nights. These include original series such as &quot;Imagination Theater&quot; and a radio adaptation of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; TV series, as well as rerun compilations such as the popular daily series &quot;When Radio Was&quot; and USA Radio Network&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age of Radio Theatre&quot;, and weekly programs such as &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot; on WAMU, hosted by Murray Horwitz. These shows usually air in late nights and/or on weekends on small AM stations. Carl Amari&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio show &quot;Hollywood 360&quot; features 5 old-time radio episodes each week during his 5-hour broadcast. Amari&#x27;s show is heard on 100+ radio stations coast-to-coast and in 168 countries on American Forces Radio. Local rerun compilations are also heard, primarily on public radio stations. Sirius XM Radio maintains a full-time Radio Classics channel devoted to rebroadcasts of vintage radio shows.

Starting in 1974, Garrison Keillor, through his syndicated two-hour-long program &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, has provided a living museum of the production, tone and listener&#x27;s experience of this era of radio for several generations after its demise. Produced live in theaters throughout the country, using the same sound effects and techniques of the era, it ran through 2016 with Keillor as host. The program included segments that were close renditions (in the form of parody) of specific genres of this era, including Westerns (&quot;Dusty and Lefty, The Lives of the Cowboys&quot;), detective procedurals (&quot;Guy Noir, Private Eye&quot;) and even advertising through fictional commercials. Keillor also wrote a novel, &quot;&quot; based on a radio station of this era—including a personally narrated version for the ultimate in verisimilitude. Upon Keillor&#x27;s retirement, replacement host Chris Thile chose to reboot the show (since renamed &quot;Live from Here&quot; after the syndicator cut ties with Keillor) and eliminate much of the old-time radio trappings of the format; the show was ultimately canceled in 2020 due to financial and logistics problems.

Vintage shows and new audio productions in America are accessible more widely from recordings or by satellite and web broadcasters, rather than over conventional AM and FM radio. The National Audio Theatre Festival is a national organization and yearly conference keeping the audio arts—especially audio drama—alive, and continues to involve long-time voice actors and OTR veterans in its ranks. Its predecessor, the Midwest Radio Theatre Workshop, was first hosted by Jim Jordan, of &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; fame, and Norman Corwin advised the organization.

One of the longest running radio programs celebrating this era is &quot;The Golden Days of Radio&quot;, which was hosted on the Armed Forces Radio Service for more than 20 years and overall for more than 50 years by Frank Bresee, who also played &quot;Little Beaver&quot; on the &quot;Red Ryder&quot; program as a child actor.

One of the very few still-running shows from the earlier era of radio is a Christian program entitled &quot;Unshackled!&quot; The weekly half-hour show, produced in Chicago by Pacific Garden Mission, has been continuously broadcast since 1950. The shows are created using techniques from the 1950s (including home-made sound effects) and are broadcast across the U.S. and around the world by thousands of radio stations.

Today, radio performers of the past appear at conventions that feature re-creations of classic shows, as well as music, memorabilia and historical panels. The largest of these events was the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention, held in Newark, New Jersey, which held its final convention in October 2011 after 36 years. Others include REPS in Seattle (June), SPERDVAC in California, the Cincinnati OTR &amp; Nostalgia Convention (April), and the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention (September). Veterans of the Friends of Old Time Radio Convention, including Chairperson Steven M. Lewis of The Gotham Radio Players, Maggie Thompson, publisher of the &quot;Comic Book Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Craig Wichman of audio drama troupe Quicksilver Audio Theater and long-time FOTR Publicist Sean Dougherty have launched a successor event, Celebrating Audio Theater – Old &amp; New, scheduled for October 12–13, 2012.

Radio dramas from the golden age are sometimes recreated as live stage performances at such events. One such group, led by director Daniel Smith, has been performing re-creations of old-time radio dramas at Fairfield University&#x27;s Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts since the year 2000.

The 40th anniversary of what is widely considered the end of the old time radio era (the final broadcasts of &quot;Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar&quot; and &quot;Suspense&quot; on September 30, 1962) was marked with a commentary on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

A handful of radio programs from the old-time era remain in production, all from the genres of news, music, or religious broadcasting: the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; (1925), &quot;Music and the Spoken Word&quot; (1929), &quot;The Lutheran Hour&quot; (1930), the &quot;CBS World News Roundup&quot; (1938), &quot;King Biscuit Time&quot; (1941) and the &quot;Renfro Valley Gatherin&#x27;&quot; (1943). Of those, all but the Opry maintain their original short-form length of 30 minutes or less. The &quot;Wheeling Jamboree&quot; counts an earlier program on a competing station as part of its history, tracing its lineage back to 1933.

Western revival/comedy act Riders in the Sky produced a radio serial &quot;Riders Radio Theater&quot; in the 1980s and 1990s and continues to provide sketch comedy on existing radio programs including the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;, &quot;Midnite Jamboree&quot; and &quot;WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour&quot;.

===Elsewhere===
Regular broadcasts of radio plays are also heard in—among other countries—Australia, Croatia, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, and Sweden. In the United Kingdom, such scripted radio drama continues on BBC Radio 3 and (principally) BBC Radio 4, the second-most popular radio station in the country, as well as on the rerun channel BBC Radio 4 Extra, which is the seventh-most popular station there.

<text>Jack Benny (born Benjamin Kubelsky; February 14, 1894 – December 26, 1974) was an American entertainer who evolved from a modest success playing the violin on the vaudeville circuit to one of the leading entertainers of the twentieth century with a highly popular comedic career in radio, television, and film. He was known for his comic timing and the ability to cause laughter with a long pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated summation &quot;Well!&quot;

His radio and television programs, popular from 1932 until his death in 1974, were a major influence on the sitcom genre. Benny portrayed himself as a miser who obliviously played his violin badly and claimed perpetually to be 39 years of age.

==Early life==

Benny was born Benjamin Kubelsky on February 14, 1894 in Chicago, and grew up in nearby Waukegan. He was the son of Jewish immigrants Meyer Kubelsky (1864–1946) and Naomi Emma ( Sachs; 1869–1917). Meyer was a saloon owner and later a haberdasher who had emigrated to the United States of America from Poland. Emma had emigrated from Lithuania. At his father&#x27;s behest, Benny began taking violin lessons at the age of six and was soon considered to be a child prodigy. He loved the instrument but hated to practice. His music teacher was Otto Graham Sr., a neighbor and father of football player Otto Graham. At 14, Benny was playing in dance bands and his high school orchestra. He was a dreamer and poor at his studies, ultimately getting expelled from high school. He later did poorly in business school and in attempts to join his father&#x27;s business. In 1911, he began playing the violin in local vaudeville theaters for US$7.50 a week ($ in ). He was joined on the circuit by Ned Miller, a young composer and singer.

That same year, Benny was playing in the same theater as the young Marx Brothers. Minnie, their mother, enjoyed Benny&#x27;s violin playing and invited him to accompany her boys in their act. Benny&#x27;s parents refused to let their son go on the road at 17, but it was the beginning of his long friendship with the Marx Brothers, especially Zeppo Marx.

The next year, Benny formed a vaudeville musical duo with pianist Cora Folsom Salisbury, who needed a partner for her act. This angered famous violinist Jan Kubelik, who feared that the young vaudevillian with a similar name would damage his reputation. Under legal pressure, Benjamin Kubelsky agreed to change his name to Ben K. Benny, sometimes spelled Bennie. When Salisbury left the act, Benny found a new pianist, Lyman Woods, and renamed the act &quot;From Grand Opera to Ragtime&quot;. They worked together for five years and slowly integrated comedy elements into the show. They reached the Palace Theater, the &quot;Mecca of Vaudeville&quot;, and did not do well. Benny left show business briefly in 1917 to join the United States Navy during World War I, often entertaining fellow sailors with his violin playing. One evening, his violin performance was booed by the sailors, so with prompting from fellow sailor and actor Pat O&#x27;Brien, he ad-libbed his way out of the jam and left them laughing. He received more comedy spots in the revues and did well, earning a reputation as a comedian and musician. Despite stories to the contrary, no reliable evidence indicates Jack Benny was aboard during the 1915 &quot;Eastland&quot; disaster or scheduled to be on the excursion; possibly the basis for this report was that &quot;Eastland&quot; was a training vessel during World War I and Benny received his training in the Great Lakes naval base where &quot;Eastland&quot; was stationed. Benny achieved the rank of Seaman First Class.

Shortly after the war, Benny developed a one-man act, &quot;Ben K. Benny: Fiddle Funology&quot;. He then received legal pressure from Ben Bernie, a &quot;patter-and-fiddle&quot; performer, regarding his name, so he adopted the sailor&#x27;s nickname of Jack. By 1921, the fiddle was more of a prop, and the low-key comedy took over.

Benny had some romantic encounters, including one with dancer Mary Kelly, whose devoutly Catholic family forced her to turn down his proposal because he was Jewish. Benny was introduced to Kelly by Gracie Allen.
In 1922, Benny accompanied Zeppo Marx to a Passover Seder in Vancouver at the residence where he met 17-year-old Sadie Marks (whose family was friends with, but not related to, the Marx family). Their first meeting did not go well when he tried to leave during Sadie&#x27;s violin performance. They met again in 1926. Jack had not remembered their earlier meeting and was immediately taken with her. They married the following year. She was working in the hosiery section of the downtown LA Broadway Boulevard May Company, this was across the street from the Orpheum Theater. Jack was playing at the theater. Called on to fill in for the &quot;dumb girl&quot; part in a Benny routine, Sadie proved to be a natural comedienne. Adopting the stage name Mary Livingstone, Sadie collaborated with Benny throughout most of his career. They later adopted a daughter, Joan (1934–2021). Sadie&#x27;s older sister Babe would often be the target of jokes about unattractive or masculine women, while her younger brother Hilliard would later produce Benny&#x27;s radio and TV work.

In 1929, Benny&#x27;s agent, Sam Lyons, convinced Irving Thalberg, American film producer at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, to watch Benny at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. Benny signed a five-year contract with MGM, where his first role was in &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;. The next film, &quot;Chasing Rainbows&quot;, did not do well, and after several months Benny was released from his contract and returned to Broadway in Earl Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Vanities&quot;. At first dubious about the viability of radio, Benny grew eager to break into the new medium. In 1932, after a four-week nightclub run, he was invited onto Ed Sullivan&#x27;s radio program, uttering his first radio &quot;This is Jack Benny talking. There will be a slight pause while you say, &#x27;Who cares?

==Radio==

Benny had been a minor vaudeville performer before becoming a national figure with &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, a weekly radio show that ran from 1932 to 1948 on NBC and from 1949 to 1955 on CBS. It was among the most highly rated programs during its run.

Benny&#x27;s long radio career began on April 6, 1932, when the NBC Commercial Program Department auditioned him for the N. W. Ayer &amp; Son agency and their client Canada Dry, after which Bertha Brainard, head of the division, said, &quot;We think Mr. Benny is excellent for radio and, while the audition was unassisted as far as orchestra was concerned, we believe he would make a great bet for an air program.&quot; Recalling the experience in 1956, Benny said Ed Sullivan had invited him to guest on his program (1932), and &quot;the agency for Canada Dry ginger ale heard me and offered me a job.&quot;

With Canada Dry ginger ale as a sponsor, Benny came to radio on &quot;The Canada Dry Program&quot;, on May 2, 1932, broadcast on Mondays and Wednesdays on the NBC Blue Network, featuring George Olsen and his orchestra. After a few shows, Benny hired Harry Conn as writer. The show continued on Blue for six months until October 26, moving to CBS on October 30, now airing Thursdays and Sundays. With Ted Weems leading the band, Benny stayed on CBS until January 26, 1933, when Canada Dry opted not to renew Benny&#x27;s contract after it attempted to replace Conn with Sid Silvers, who would have also gotten a co-starring role. Unlike later incarnations of the Benny show, &quot;The Canada Dry&quot; &quot;Program&quot; was primarily a musical program.

Benny then appeared on &quot;The Chevrolet Program&quot;, airing on the NBC Red Network between March 17, 1933, until April 1, 1934, initially airing on Fridays (replacing Al Jolson), moving to Sunday nights in the fall. The show, which featured Benny and Livingstone alongside Frank Black&#x27;s orchestra and vocalists James Melton and (later) Frank Parker, ended after General Motors&#x27; president insisted on a musical program. He continued with sponsor General Tire on Fridays through the end of September.

The show switched networks to CBS on January 2, 1949, as part of CBS president William S. Paley&#x27;s notorious &quot;raid&quot; on NBC talent in 1948–1949. It stayed there for the remainder of its radio run, ending on May 22, 1955. CBS aired repeat episodes from 1956 to 1958 as &quot;The Best of Benny&quot;.

==Television==


After making his television debut in 1949 on local Los Angeles station KTTV, then a CBS affiliate, the network television version of &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; ran from October 28, 1950, to 1965, all but the last season on CBS. Initially scheduled as a series of five &quot;specials&quot; during the 1950–1951 season, the show appeared every six weeks for the 1951–1952 season, every four weeks for the 1952–1953 season and every three weeks in 1953–1954. For the 1953–1954 season, half the episodes were live and half were filmed during the summer, to allow Benny to continue doing his radio show. From the fall of 1954 to 1960, it appeared every other week, and from 1960 to 1965 it was seen weekly.

On March 28, 1954, Benny co-hosted &quot;General Foods 25th Anniversary Show: A Salute to Rodgers and Hammerstein&quot; with Groucho Marx and Mary Martin. In September 1954, CBS premiered Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;Shower of Stars&quot; co-hosted by Jack Benny and William Lundigan. It enjoyed a successful run from 1954 until 1958. Both television shows often overlapped the radio show. In fact, the radio show alluded frequently to its television counterparts. Often as not, Benny would sign off the radio show in such circumstances with the line &quot;Well, good night, folks. I&#x27;ll see you on television.&quot;

When Benny moved to television, audiences learned that his verbal talent was matched by his controlled repertory of dead-pan facial expressions and gesture. The program was similar to the radio show (several of the radio scripts were recycled for television, as was somewhat common with other radio shows that moved to television), but with the addition of visual gags. Lucky Strike was the sponsor. Benny did his opening and closing monologues before a live audience, which he regarded as essential to timing of the material. As in other TV comedy shows, a laugh track was added to &quot;sweeten&quot; the soundtrack, as when the studio audience missed some close-up comedy because of cameras or microphones obstructing their view. Television viewers became accustomed to live without Mary Livingstone, who was afflicted by a striking case of stage fright that didn&#x27;t lessen even after performing with Benny for 20 years. Hence, Livingstone appeared rarely if at all on the television show. In fact, for the last few years of the radio show, she pre-recorded her lines and Jack and Mary&#x27;s daughter, Joan, stood in for the live taping, with Mary&#x27;s lines later edited into the tape replacing Joan&#x27;s before broadcast. Mary Livingstone finally retired from show business permanently in 1958, as her friend Gracie Allen had done.

Benny&#x27;s television program relied more on guest stars and less on his regulars than his radio program. In fact, the only radio cast members who appeared regularly on the television program as well were Don Wilson and Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson. Singer Dennis Day appeared sporadically, and Phil Harris had left the radio program in 1952, although he did make a guest appearance on the television show (Bob Crosby, Phil&#x27;s &quot;replacement&quot;, frequently appeared on television through 1956). A frequent guest was the Canadian-born singer-violinist Gisele Mackenzie.

As a gag, Benny made a 1957 appearance on the then-wildly popular &quot;$64,000 Question&quot;. His category of choice was &quot;Violins&quot;, but after answering the first question correctly Benny opted out of continuing, leaving the show with just $64; host Hal March gave Benny the prize money out of his own pocket. March made an appearance on Benny&#x27;s show the same year.
Benny was able to attract guests who rarely, if ever, appeared on television. In 1953, both Marilyn Monroe and Humphrey Bogart made their television debuts on Benny&#x27;s program.

Another guest star on the Jack Benny show was Rod Serling, who starred in a spoof of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; in which Benny goes to his own house and finds that no one knows who he is; Jack runs away screaming in panic; Serling breaks the fourth wall and remarks not to worry about Benny on the grounds that anyone who has been 39 years old as long as he has is a citizen of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;.

In 1964, Walt Disney was a guest, primarily to promote his production of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. Benny persuaded Disney to give him over 110 free admission tickets to Disneyland for his friends and one for his wife, but later in the show Disney apparently sent his pet tiger after Benny as revenge, at which point Benny opened his umbrella and soared above the stage like Mary Poppins.

CBS dropped the show in 1964, citing Benny&#x27;s lack of appeal to the younger demographic the network began courting, and he went to NBC, his original network, in the fall, only to be out-rated by CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; The network dropped Benny at the end of the season. He continued to make occasional specials into the 1970s, the last one airing in January 1974. Benny also appeared on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; twice: Once as a plumber who resembles Jack Benny and in 1967 &quot;Lucy Gets Jack Benny&#x27;s account&quot; where Lucy takes Jack on a tour of his new money vault. In the late 1960s, Benny did a series of commercials for Texaco Sky Chief gasoline, using his &quot;stingy&quot; television persona, always telling the attendant, played by Dennis Day, after being implored, &quot;Mr. Benny, won&#x27;t you please fill up?&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll take a gallon.&quot;
In his unpublished autobiography, &quot;I Always Had Shoes&quot; (portions of which were later incorporated by Jack&#x27;s daughter, Joan Benny, into her memoir of her parents, &quot;Sunday Nights at Seven&quot;), Benny said that he, not NBC, made the decision to end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still very good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing, no matter what they promised), advertisers were complaining that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the &quot;rate race&quot;. Thus, after some three decades on radio and television in a weekly program, Jack Benny went out on top. In fairness, Benny himself shared Fred Allen&#x27;s ambivalence about television, though not quite to Allen&#x27;s extent. &quot;By my second year in television, I saw that the camera was a man-eating monster ... It gave a performer close-up exposure that, week after week, threatened his existence as an interesting entertainer.&quot;

In a joint appearance with Phil Silvers on Dick Cavett&#x27;s show, Benny recalled that he had advised Silvers not to appear on television. However, Silvers ignored Benny&#x27;s advice and proceeded to win several Emmy awards as Sergeant Bilko on the popular series &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

==Films==

Benny also acted in films, including the Academy Award-winning &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;, &quot;Broadway Melody of 1936&quot; (as a benign nemesis for Eleanor Powell and Robert Taylor), &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; (1942), and notably, &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; (1941) and &quot;To Be or Not to Be&quot; (1942). He and Livingstone also appeared in Ed Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot; (1933) as themselves. Benny often parodied contemporary films and genres on the radio program, and the 1940 film &quot;Buck Benny Rides Again&quot; features all the main radio characters in a funny Western parody adapted from program skits. The failure of one cinematic Benny vehicle, &quot;The Horn Blows at Midnight&quot;, became a running gag on his radio and television programs, although contemporary viewers may not find the film as disappointing as the jokes suggest.

Benny may have had an uncredited cameo role in &quot;Casablanca&quot;, claimed by a contemporary newspaper article and advertisement and reportedly in the &quot;Casablanca&quot; press book. When asked in his column &quot;Movie Answer Man&quot;, film critic Roger Ebert first replied, &quot;It looks something like him. That&#x27;s all I can say.&quot; He wrote in a later column, &quot;I think you&#x27;re right.&quot;

Benny also was caricatured in several Warner Brothers cartoons including &quot;Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur&quot; (1939, as Casper the Caveman), &quot;I Love to Singa&quot;, &quot;Slap Happy Pappy&quot;, and &quot;Goofy Groceries&quot; (1936, 1940, and 1941 respectively, as Jack Bunny), &quot;Malibu Beach Party&quot; (1940, as himself), and &quot;The Mouse that Jack Built&quot; (1959). The last of these is probably the most memorable: Robert McKimson engaged Benny and his actual cast (Mary Livingstone, Eddie “Rochester” Anderson, and Don Wilson) to do the voices for the mouse versions of their characters, with Mel Blancthe usual Warner Brothers cartoon voicemeisterreprising his old vocal turn as the always-aging Maxwell, always a &quot;phat&quot;-phat-&quot;bang!&quot; away from collapse. In the cartoon, Benny and Livingstone agree to spend their anniversary at the Kit-Kat Club, which they discover the hard way is inside the mouth of a live cat. Before the cat can devour the mice, Benny himself awakens from his dream, then shakes his head, smiles wryly, and mutters, &quot;Imagine, me and Mary as little mice.&quot; Then, he glances toward the cat lying on a throw rug in a corner and sees his and Livingstone&#x27;s cartoon alter egos scampering out of the cat&#x27;s mouth. The cartoon ends with a classic Benny look of befuddlement. It was rumored that Benny requested that, in lieu of monetary compensation, he receive a copy of the finished film.

Benny made a cameo appearance in &quot;It&#x27;s A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;.

== Final years ==

After his broadcasting career ended, Benny performed live as a violinist and as a standup comedian.

In the 1960s, Benny was the headlining act at Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe with trumpeter Harry James, clown Emmett Kelly and singer Ray Vasquez.

Benny made one of his final television appearances on January 23, 1974, as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, during which he recreated several classic radio skits with Mel Blanc the day before his final television special aired. Benny was preparing to star in the film version of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; when his health failed later the same year. He prevailed upon his longtime best friend, George Burns, to take his place on a nightclub tour while preparing for the film. Burns ultimately had to replace Benny in the film as well, going on to win an Academy Award for his performance.

Benny made one last appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on August 21, 1974, with Rich Little as guest host. According to his own statement during that appearance, Benny was still expecting to star in &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot;. He also made several appearances on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; in his final 18 months, roasting Ronald Reagan, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and Lucille Ball, in addition to himself being roasted in February 1974. The Lucille Ball roast, his last public performance, aired on February 7, 1975, several weeks after his death.

===Death===

In October 1974, Benny cancelled a performance in Dallas after suffering a dizzy spell, coupled with numbness in his arms. Despite a battery of tests, Benny&#x27;s ailment could not be determined. When he complained of stomach pains in early December, a first test showed nothing, but a subsequent examination showed that he had inoperable pancreatic cancer. Benny went into a coma at home on December 22, 1974. While in a coma, he was visited by close friends, including George Burns, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Carson, John Rowles and then Governor Ronald Reagan. He died on December 26, 1974, at age 80. 

1,800 people attended his funeral at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California on December 29; the biggest funeral for a Hollywood personality since Harry Cohn in 1958. Burns, Benny&#x27;s best friend for more than fifty years, attempted to deliver a eulogy but broke down shortly after he began and was unable to continue. Hope also delivered a eulogy in which he stated, &quot;For a man who was the undisputed master of comedic timing, you would have to say this is the only time when Jack Benny&#x27;s timing was all wrong. He left us much too soon.&quot; Pallbearers included Sinatra, Mervyn LeRoy, Gregory Peck, Milton Berle, Billy Wilder, Irving Fein, Leonard Gershe, Fred de Cordova and Armand Deutsch. Benny was interred in the main mausoleum of the cemetry. His will arranged for a single long-stemmed red rose to be delivered to his widow, Mary Livingstone, every day for the rest of her life. Livingstone died eight and a half years later on June 30, 1983, at the age of 78.

In trying to explain his successful life, Benny summed it up by stating: &quot;Everything good that happened to me happened by accident. I was not filled with ambition nor fired by a drive toward a clear-cut goal. I never knew exactly where I was going.&quot;

Upon his death, Benny&#x27;s family donated his personal, professional and business papers, as well as a collection of his television shows, to UCLA. The university established the Jack Benny Award for Comedy in his honor in 1977 to recognize outstanding people in the field of comedy. Johnny Carson was the first award recipient. Benny also donated a Stradivarius violin (purchased in 1957) to the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Benny had quipped, &quot;If it isn&#x27;t a $30,000 Strad, I&#x27;m out $120.&quot;

==Honors and tributes==
In 1960, Benny was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with three stars. His stars for television and motion pictures are located at 6370 and 6650 Hollywood Boulevard, respectively, and at 1505 Vine Street for radio. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1988 and the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1989. He was also inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame.

Benny was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state&#x27;s highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1972 in the area of the performing arts.

&quot;A Tribute To Jack Benny&quot;, written and narrated by Charles Kuralt, was aired on CBS-TV on the day of his funeral, including coverage of the funeral service.

When the price of a standard first-class U.S. postal stamp was increased to 39 cents in 2006, fans petitioned for a Jack Benny stamp to honor his stage persona&#x27;s perpetual age. The U.S. Postal Service had issued a stamp depicting Benny in 1991 as part of a booklet of stamps honoring comedians; however, the stamp was issued at the then-current rate of 29 cents.

Jack Benny Middle School in Waukegan is named after Benny. Its motto matches his famous statement as &quot;Home of the &#x27;39ers.&quot; A statue of Benny with his violin stands in downtown Waukegan.

The British comedian Benny Hill, whose original name was Alfred Hawthorne Hill, changed his name as a tribute to Jack Benny.

He was mentioned by Doc Brown in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, in which Doc guesses who would be Secretary of the Treasury by 1985, not believing Ronald Reagan was President of the United States of America.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Locrus or Lokros (; Ancient Greek: Λοκρός) may refer to:

* Locrus, the king of Locris and son of his predecessor King Physcius. He was the grandson of Amphictyon, son of Deucalion. Locrus became by Cabya the father of Opus, the mythical ancestor of the Ozolian Locrians. According to some, his wife was called Cambyse or Protogeneia. Locrus named the Lelegians Locrians after himself.
* Locrus, son of Zeus and Maera, the daughter of Proetus of Corinth. He is said to have assisted Zethus and Amphion in the building of Thebes. In some accounts, his mother was called Megaclite, daughter of Macareus and had a sister Thebe who married Zethus.
* Locrus, son of Phaeax and brother of Alcinous who emigrated to Italy where he married Laurina, the daughter of Latinus. Herakles at about that time was driving Geryon&#x27;s beautiful cows from Erytheia. He arrived and was hosted kindly by Lokros. Latinus came to visit his daughter, saw and fancied the cows and drove them away. Discovering this, Herakles shot with his bow and killed him, and brought back the cows. Lokros, fearing Herakles might suffer something terrible at the hands of Latinus, who was strong in body and spirit, had hastened to the aid of his guest, having put on military gear. Herakles seeing him running and thinking he was someone rushing to support Latinus, loosed a shaft and killed him. After he learned he mourned loudly and conducted the rites for him. And when he had passed from among men he appeared to the people as a ghost and ordered them to establish a city by the tomb of Lokros. And the city keeps the name in honor of Lokros.
* Locrus, also a Parian statuary, of unknown date whose statue of Athena in the temple of Ares, at Athens, is mentioned by Pausanias.

<text>The Sahel region (; ), or Sahelian acacia savanna, is a biogeographical region in Africa. It is the transition zone between the more humid Sudanian savannas to its south and the drier Sahara to the north. The Sahel has a hot semi-arid climate and stretches across the southernmost latitudes of North Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea. Although geographically located in the tropics, the Sahel does not have a tropical climate.

Especially in the western Sahel, there are frequent shortages of food and water due to its very high government corruption and the semi-arid climate. This is exacerbated by very high birthrates across the region, resulting in a rapid increase in population. In recent times, various coups, insurgencies, terrorism and foreign interventions have taken place in many Sahel countries, especially across former &quot;Françafrique&quot;.

== Geography ==

The Sahel spans from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Red Sea in the east, in a belt several hundred to a thousand kilometers (c. 600 miles) wide. It covers an area of .

Representing a climatic and ecological transition zone with hot semi-desert and steppe conditions, the Sahel region borders the more humid Sudanian savannas to its south and the dry Sahara desert to the north. This ecoregion is also called the Sahelian &quot;Acacia&quot; savanna in honour of its most prominent and very drought tolerant genus of tree.

The topography of the Sahel is mainly flat; most of the region lies between in elevation. Several isolated plateaus and mountain ranges rise from the Sahel (e.g. Marrah Mountains, Aïr Mountains, Ennedi Plateau), but are designated as separate ecoregions because their flora and fauna are distinct from the surrounding lowlands (e.g. East Saharan woodlands). Annual rainfall varies from around in the north of the Sahel to around in the south.

===Flora and fauna===
The Sahel is mostly covered in grassland and savanna, with areas of woodland and shrubland. Grass cover is fairly continuous across the region, dominated by annual grass species such as &quot;Cenchrus biflorus, Schoenefeldia gracilis&quot; and &quot;Aristida stipoides&quot;. Species of acacia are the dominant trees, with &quot;Acacia tortilis&quot; the most common, along with &quot;Senegalia senegal&quot; and &quot;Senegalia laeta&quot;. Other tree species include &quot;Adansonia digitata&quot;, &quot;Commiphora africana&quot;, &quot;Balanites aegyptiaca&quot;, &quot;Faidherbia albida&quot;, &quot;Borassus aethiopum&quot;, &quot;Vitellaria paradoxa&quot;, &quot;Olea europaea&quot;, &quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;, &quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;, &quot;Hyphaene compressa&quot;, &quot;Cupressus sempervirens&quot;, &quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;, &quot;Quercus suber&quot;, &quot;Pinus nigra&quot;, &quot;Populus nigra&quot;, &quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;, &quot;Salix alba&quot;, &quot;Afzelia africana&quot;, &quot;Kigelia africana&quot;, &quot;Sclerocarya birrea&quot;, and &quot;Boscia senegalensis&quot;. In the northern part of the Sahel, areas of desert shrub, including &quot;Panicum turgidum&quot; and &quot;Aristida sieberiana&quot;, alternate with areas of grassland and savanna. During the long dry season, many trees lose their leaves and the predominantly annual grasses die.

The Sahel was formerly home to large populations of grazing mammals, including the scimitar-horned oryx &quot;(Oryx dammah)&quot;, dama gazelle &quot;(Gazella dama)&quot;, Dorcas gazelle &quot;(Gazella dorcas)&quot;, red-fronted gazelle &quot;(Gazella rufifrons)&quot;, the giant prehistoric buffalo &quot;(Pelorovis)&quot;, and Bubal hartebeest &quot;(Alcelaphus buselaphus buselaphus)&quot;, along with large predators, such as the African wild dog &quot;(Lycaon pictus)&quot;, the Northwest African cheetah &quot;(Acinonyx jubatus hecki)&quot;, the Northeast African cheetah &quot;(Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii)&quot;, and the lion &quot;(Panthera leo)&quot;. The larger species have been greatly reduced in number by over-hunting and competition with livestock, and several species are vulnerable (Dorcas gazelle, cheetah, lion and red-fronted gazelle), endangered (Dama gazelle and African wild dog), or extinct (the Scimitar-horned oryx is probably extinct in the wild, and both &quot;Pelorovis&quot; and the Bubal hartebeest are now extinct).

The seasonal wetlands of the Sahel are important for migratory birds moving within Africa and on the African-Eurasian flyways.

=== Climate ===
The Sahel has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;). The climate is typically hot, sunny, dry and somewhat windy all year long. The Sahel&#x27;s climate is similar to, but less extreme than, the climate of the Sahara desert located just to the north.

The Sahel mainly receives a low to very low amount of precipitation annually. The steppe has a very long, prevailing dry season and a short rainy season. The precipitation is also extremely irregular, and varies considerably from season to season. Most of the rain usually falls during four to six months in the middle of the year, while the other months may remain absolutely dry. The interior of the Sahel region generally receives between 200 mm and 700 mm of rain yearly. A system of subdivisions often adopted for the Sahelian climate based on annual rainfall is as follows: the Saharan-Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 100 and 200 mm (such as Khartoum, Sudan), the strict Sahelian climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 200 and 700 mm (such as Niamey, Niger) and the Sahelian-Sudanese climate, with mean annual precipitation between around 700 and 900 mm (such as Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso). The relative humidity in the steppe is low to very low, often between 10% and 25% during the dry season and between 25% and 75% during the rainy season. The least humid places have a relative humidity under 35%.

The Sahel is characterized by constant, intense heat, with an unvarying temperature. The Sahel rarely experiences cold temperatures. During the hottest period, the average high temperatures are generally between (and even more in the hottest regions), often for more than three months, while the average low temperatures are around . During the &quot;coldest period&quot;, the average high temperatures are between and the average low temperatures are between . Everywhere in the Sahel, the average mean temperature is over .

The Sahel has a high to very high sunshine duration year-round, between 2,400 hours (about 55% of the daylight hours) and 3,600 hours (more than 80% of the daylight hours). The sunshine duration in the Sahel approaches desert levels, and is comparable to that in the Arabian Desert, for example, even though the Sahel is only a steppe and not a desert. The cloud cover is low to very low. For example, Niamey, Niger has 3,082 hours of bright sunshine; Gao, Mali has near 3,385 hours of sunshine; Timbuktu, Mali has 3,409 sunny hours, and N&#x27;Djamena, Chad has 3,205 hours of sunlight.

===Recent droughts===

For hundreds of years, the Sahel region has experienced frequent droughts and megadroughts. One megadrought lasted from 1450 to 1700, 250 years. There was a major drought in the Sahel in 1914 caused by annual rains far below average, leading to large-scale famine. From 1951 to 2004, the Sahel experienced some of the most consistent and severe droughts in Africa. The 1960s saw a large increase in rainfall in the region, making the northern drier region more accessible. There was a push, supported by governments, for people to move northwards. When the long drought period from 1968 through 1974 began, grazing quickly became unsustainable and large-scale denuding of the terrain followed. Like the drought in 1914, this led to a large-scale famine, but this time somewhat tempered by international visibility and an outpouring of aid. This catastrophe led to the founding of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.

====2010 drought====
Between June and August 2010, famine struck the Sahel. Niger&#x27;s crops failed to mature in the heat, 350,000 faced starvation, and 1,200,000 were at risk of famine. In Chad the temperature reached on 22 June in Faya-Largeau, breaking a record set in 1961 at the same location. Niger tied its highest temperature record set in 1998, also on 22 June, at 47.1 °C in Bilma. That record was broken the next day, when Bilma hit . The hottest temperature recorded in Sudan was reached on 25 June, at in Dongola, breaking a record set in 1987. Niger reported on 14 July that diarrhoea, starvation, gastroenteritis, malnutrition and respiratory diseases had sickened or killed many children. The new military junta appealed for international food aid and took serious steps to call on overseas help. On 26 July, the heat reached near-record levels over Chad and Niger, and in northern Niger about 20 people reportedly died of dehydration by 27 July.

===Desertification and soil loss===

The Sahel region faces environmental issues that are contributing to global warming. If the change in climate in the Sahel region &quot;is not slowed-down and desertification possibly reversed through sustainable practices and any form of reforestation, it is only a matter of time before countries like Niger lose their entire landmass to desert due to unchecked unsustainable human practices. Over-farming, over-grazing, over-population of marginal lands, and natural soil erosion, have caused serious desertification of the region. This has affected shelter construction, making it necessary to change the used materials. The Woodless Construction project was introduced in Sahel in 1980 by the Development Workshop, achieving since then a high social impact in the region. A major initiative to combat desertification in the Sahel region via reforestation and other interventions is the Great Green Wall.

Major dust storms are a frequent occurrence as well. During November 2004, a number of major dust storms hit Chad, originating in the Bodélé Depression. This is a common area for dust storms, occurring on average on 100 days every year.

On 23 March 2010, a major sandstorm hit Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, and inland Sierra Leone. Another struck in southern Algeria, inland Mauritania, Mali and northern Ivory Coast at the same time.

Following the drought period of the 1970s and 1980, however, the Sahel began to experience increased rainfall. This may be due to global warming, which can cause changes that may result in changes in large-scale weather patterns, such as increased stronger monsoons, in turn caused by a warmer Atlantic Ocean. Warming of the Mediterranean Sea may also be a factor.

===Protected areas===
Protected areas in the Sahel include Ferlo Nord Wildlife Reserve in Senegal, Sylvo-Pastoral and Partial Faunal Reserve of the Sahel in Burkina Faso, Ansonga-Ménake Faunal Reserve in Mali, Tadres Reserve in Niger, and Waza National Park in Cameroon.

==Culture==

Traditionally, most of the people in the Sahel have been semi-nomads, farming and raising livestock in a system of transhumance. The difference between the dry North with higher levels of soil nutrients and the wetter South with more vegetation, is utilized by having the herds graze on high-quality feed in the North during the wet season, and trek several hundred kilometers to the South to graze on more abundant, but less nutritious feed during the dry period.

In Western Sahel, polygamy and child marriage are common. Female genital mutilation is also practiced across the Sahel.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Sahel&quot; is borrowed from the Arabic name for the region, &#x27;. &#x27; literally means &quot;coast, shore&quot;, which has been explained as a figurative reference to the southern edge of the vast Sahara. However, such use is unattested in Classical Arabic, and it has been suggested that the word may originally have been derived from the Arabic word &quot;&quot; &quot;plain&quot; instead.

==History==
===Early agriculture===
Around 4000 BC, the climate of the Sahara and the Sahel started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace. This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing desertification. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and caused migrations of farming communities to the more humid climate of West Africa.

===Sahelian kingdoms===


The Sahelian kingdoms were a series of monarchies centered in the Sahel between the 9th and 18th centuries. The wealth of the states, like the legendary Mali Empire at the time of Mansa Musa, came from controlling the trans-Saharan trade routes across the desert, especially with the Maghreb. Their power came from having large pack animals like camels and horses that were fast enough to keep a large empire under central control and were also useful in battle. All of these empires were quite decentralized with member cities having a great deal of autonomy. 

The larger Sahelian kingdoms emerged from 750 AD and erected several large cities in the Niger valley region, including Timbuktu, Gao and Djenné.

Due to the wooded areas to their south, the Sahelian states were hindered from expanding into the north Akan state of the Bonoman and Yoruba peoples, as mounted warriors were all but useless in the forests. In addition, the horses and camels were susceptible to the humidity and diseases of the tropics.

===Colonial period===
The Western Sahel fell to France in the late 19th century as part of French West Africa. Chad was added in 1900 as part of French Equatorial Africa. The French territories in the Sahel were decolonized in 1960.

The Sahel&#x27;s easternmost region did not fall to the European powers but to the Khedivate of Egypt when it was conquered by Muhammad Ali in the 1820s. By 1899 it came under British rule until granted independence at Egypt&#x27;s behest in 1956.

==Instability and violence==

=== Terrorism ===

According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, in recent years the Sahel has become the epicenter of terrorist violence, contributing to 35% of all global deaths from terrorism by 2021, with Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, an al-Qaeda-affiliated group, identified as the world&#x27;s fastest-growing terrorist organization. In 2023, fatalities from conflict in the central Sahel rose by 38%, according to data from the research organization Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. 

In the wake of the Libyan Crisis beginning in 2011, terrorist organizations operating in the Sahel, including Boko Haram, Islamic State and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), have greatly exacerbated the violence, extremism and instability of the region. In March 2020, the United States sent a special envoy for the Sahel region to combat the rising violence from terrorist groups. The Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need has highlighted the fact that the Sahel has become one of the most dangerous regions in the world for Christians.

As of 2024, a wave of new military juntas in Africa, favoring Russian mercenaries over Western forces and UN peacekeepers, has intensified violence. This led Mauritania and Chad to disband the G5 Sahel, an anti-terrorism alliance, after the military regimes in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mali withdrew.

=== Human rights issues and political instability ===
On 9 July 2020, the United States raised concerns over growing number of allegations of human rights violations and abuses by state security forces in Sahel. The US response came after Human Rights Watch released documents regarding the same on 1 July. Reports in March 2022 show militants are expanding and spreading out south of the Sahel.

The area has also seen a high prevalence of coups d&#x27;état, with military juntas currently ruling in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Sudan.

=== Other challenges ===

The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by climate change, land degradation, and rapid population growth. Droughts and food shortages have been also linked to the Mali War.

The Sahel is experiencing more severe weather due to climate change, exemplified by the extreme heatwave of March-April 2024 in Burkina Faso and Mali. This event was intensified by a 1.2°C global temperature increase from human activities.

<text>In Greek mythology, Lycorias (Ancient Greek: Λυκωριάς) was the &quot;yellow haired&quot; Nereid, one of the fifty marine-nymph daughters of &#x27;Old Man of the Sea&#x27; Nereus and the Oceanid Doris.

== Mythology ==
Lycorias was mentioned by Virgil as one of the nymphs in the train of Cyrene&quot;But from her chamber in the river depth the mother heard his cry. Around her the Nymphs carded Milesian fleeces stained with rich sea-dyes, Drymo and Xantho, Ligea and Phyllodoce, their bright tresses falling loose over their snowy necks; and Cydippe and golden-haired Lycorias, the one a maiden, the other even then knowing the first throes of travail; and Clio and Beroë her sister, both daughters of Ocean, both&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Meliboea or Meliboia () was a name attributed to the following individuals:

*Meliboea, daughter of the Titan Oceanus possibly by his sister-wife Tethys. She was the Oceanid who became the mother of King Lycaon of Arcadia with Pelasgus. She was also loved by the river god Orontes, who stopped his waters out of love for her, flooding the land.
*Meliboea, mother of Alector by Magnes, who named the town of Meliboea in Thessaly after her. The town of Meliboea became a kingdom in eastern Thessalia (north Magnesia). Nowadays, Meliboea (Melivoia) is a municipality of Larissa regional unit. The exact place of ancient Meliboia is not known.
*Meliboea, alias Chloris of Thebes, the only Niobid spared when Artemis and Apollo killed the rest. She was so horrified at the sight of her siblings&#x27; deaths that she stayed greenishly pale for the rest of her life, and for that reason she was dubbed &quot;Chloris&quot; (&quot;the pale one&quot;).
*Meliboea, a maiden of Ephesus. She loved a young man named Alexis, but her parents betrothed her to another man, and Alexis had to leave the city. By divine intervention she was carried to the place where Alexis lived. The reunited lovers dedicated two temples to Aphrodite.
*Meliboea, mother of Phellus, according to Hesiod. Both mother and son are otherwise unknown.
*Meliboea is also an alternate name for Periboea or Eriboea, mother of Ajax the Great, who was also said to have been married to Theseus.

==Kings of Meliboea==
Famous kings of Meliboea were:
*King Poeas (Argonaut), a friend of Hercules.
*King Philoctetes, son of Poeas, was a famous archer, and a participant in the Trojan War.

<text>In Greek mythology, Melisseus (Ancient Greek: Μελισσεύς means &#x27;bee-man&#x27; or &#x27;honey-man&#x27;), the father of the nymphs Adrasteia, Ida, Melissa, and Althaea who were nurses of the infant Zeus on Crete. His parentage differs from telling to telling, ranging from Gaia and Uranus, to Karystos the eponym of Karystos, and Socus and Combe.

== Mythology ==
Melisseus was the eldest and leader of the nine Kuretes of Crete. They were chthonic &quot;daimones&quot; of Mount Ida, who clashed their spears and shields to drown out the wails of infant Zeus, whom they received from the Great Goddess, Rhea, his mother. The infant-god was hidden from his cannibal father and was raised in the cave that was sacred to the Goddess (&quot;Da&quot;) celebrated by the Kuretes, whose name it bore and still bears. The names of the two daughters of Melisseus, one called the &quot;inevitable&quot; (Adrasteia) and the other simply &quot;goddess&quot; (Ida, &quot;de&quot;) are names used for the Great Mother Rhea herself.

The &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; of Nonnus, learned and accurate in spite of its late date, elaborates and gives all nine names of the Kuretes.

The infant god was fed on milk and honey, the milk of the goat-nymph Amaltheia. Melisseus is simply another form of Melissus, also a Cretan &quot;honey-man,&quot; remembered by later mythographers as a &quot;king of Crete.&quot; Fermented honey, an entheogen that was the gift of the Goddess, preceded the knowledge of wine in Aegean culture. These honey-kings consorting with the Goddess will have combined their position of authority with a sacral role.

When he came to maturity, Zeus rewarded his nymph nurses with the horn of Amaltheia, the cornucopia or horn of plenty that is always full of food and drink. Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Hymn to Zeus,&quot; full of witty and learned detail on the god&#x27;s infancy, is at pains to show by etymologies that the mythic figures and geographical features obtained their names, and thus their very identities, through their participation in Zeus&#x27; early life. Other poets concur. A less Olympian-minded culture might have suggested that the horn was not actually Zeus&#x27; to give, and that it belonged already to the ancient and fertile Minoan-Mycenean nymphs of Crete.

In a mythic fragment that explains the connection of early Cretan culture with the island of Rhodes as deriving from Crete, Diodorus Siculus briefly relates that five of the Kuretes sailed from Crete to the Chersonnese (peninsula) opposite Rhodes, with a notable expedition, expelled the Carians who dwelt there, and settling down in the land divided it into five parts, each of them founding a city, which he named after himself. Triopas, one of the sons of Helios and Rhodos herself, who was a fugitive because of the murder of his brother Tenages, fled there and was purified of the murder by Melisseus.

<text>In Greek mythology, [[Menippe (mythology)|Menippe]] (; ) and Metioche () were daughters of Orion. They feature in a brief myth about human sacrifice.

== Family ==
Menippe and Metioche were the daughters of Orion by an unnamed mother; although their mother is not given a name, in other sources the first wife of Orion is called Side. After Orion was killed by Artemis, the girls were raised by their mother while Athena taught them the art of weaving and Aphrodite gave them beauty.

== Mythology ==
Once Menippe and Metioche&#x27;s homeland Aonia at the base of Mt. Helicon was struck by a plague, and the oracle of Apollo Gortynius, when consulted, informed the people that the two gods of the Underworld were angry and that they would only be appeased with the sacrifice of two maidens, who were to offer themselves to death of their own accord. Not two girls in the entire land were willing to sacrifice themselves and the plague continue to ravage the land until a woman brought the news of the prophecy to Menippe and Metioche. The two girls then willingly offered themselves for the sake of their countrymen.

After they thrice invoked the infernal gods, they killed themselves with their shuttles, placating the wrath of the two subterranean rulers. Persephone and Hades eventually took pity in them and metamorphosed their dead bodies into comets. The Aonians then erected them a sanctuary near Orchomenus, where a propitiatory sacrifice was offered to them every year by youths and maidens. The Aeolians called these maidens Coronides.

In Ovid&#x27;s recount of the tale, the daughters of Orion remain unnamed and sacrifice themselves for no distinctly given reason, although a withered tree and gaunt goats on a barren field are mentioned and indicate the presence of a plague. From their ashes, two youths arise and lead the funeral train for their &quot;mothers&quot; and instead of Menippe and Metioche, the youths are referred to as &quot;Coroni&quot;.

<text>Menoetius or Menoetes (; &quot;Menoitios&quot;), meaning &quot;doomed might&quot;, is a name that refers to three distinct beings from Greek mythology:

* Menoetius, a second generation Titan, son of Iapetus and Clymene or Asia, and a brother of Atlas, Prometheus and Epimetheus. Menoetius was killed by Zeus with a flash of lightning in the Titanomachy, and banished to Tartarus. His name means &quot;doomed might&quot;, deriving from the Ancient Greek words &quot;menos&quot; (&quot;might, power&quot;) and &quot;oitos&quot; (&quot;doom, pain&quot;). Hesiod described Menoetius as hubristic, meaning exceedingly prideful and impetuous to the very end. From what his name suggests, along with Hesiod&#x27;s own account, Menoetius was perhaps the Titan god of violent anger and rash action.
* Menoetes, guard of the cattle of Hades. During Heracles twelfth labor, which required him to steal the hound Cerberus from the Underworld, he slays one of Hades&#x27; cattle. A certain Menoetes, son of Keuthonymos, challenges Heracles to a wrestling match, during which Heracles hugs him and breaks his ribs before Persephone intervenes.
* Menoetius from Opus was one of the Argonauts, and son of Actor and Aegina. He was the father of Patroclus and Myrto by either Damocrateia, Sthenele, Philomela Polymele, or Periopis. Among the settlers of Locris, Menoetius was chiefly honored by King Opus II, son of Zeus and Protogeneia.

<text>The name Astyoche (; Ancient Greek: Ἀστυόχη means &#x27;possessor of the city&#x27;) or Astyocheia was attributed to the following individuals in Greek mythology:

*Astyoche, naiad daughter of the river god Simoeis, mother of Tros by Erichthonius.
*Astyoche, a Trojan princess as the daughter of King Laomedon by Strymo, Placia or Leucippe, sister of Priam, wife of Telephus and mother of Eurypylus (some call her daughter of Priam and wife of Eurypylus). She was bribed by Priam with a gold vine to persuade Eurypylus to go to the Trojan War, which resulted in him being killed in the battle (cf. the story of Eriphyle). Together with Aethilla and Medesicaste, she was taken captive after the sack of Troy and set fire to the Greek ships during their stay on the Italian coast.
*Astyoche, a Minyan princess as the daughter of King Actor of Orchomenus, son of Azeus. She was the mother of Ascalaphus and Ialmenus with Ares. The latter lay with her in secret when the maiden entered into her upper chamber.
*Astyoche, sister of Agamemnon and Menelaus. She married Strophius, and became the mother of Pylades. She is also known as Anaxibia or Cydragora.
*Astyoche, a daughter of King Phylas of Ephyra, mother of Tlepolemus by Heracles. Also known as Astydameia or Astygeneia.
*Astyoche, wife of Phylacus, mother of Protesilaus and Podarces. These two are otherwise known as grandsons of Phylacus through Iphiclus.
*Astyoche, one of the Niobids.
*Astyoche, mother of Pentheus, otherwise known as Agave.
*Astyoche, daughter of Itylus and possible mother of Ajax the Lesser.
*Astyoche, mother of Euryalus by Mecisteus.
