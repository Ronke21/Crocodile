<text>Brazil is a 1985 dystopian science-fiction black comedy film directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Gilliam, Charles McKeown, and Tom Stoppard. The film stars Jonathan Pryce and features Robert De Niro, Kim Greist, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Bob Hoskins, and Ian Holm.

The film centres on Sam Lowry, a low-ranking bureaucrat trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living in a small apartment, set in a dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines. &quot;Brazil&quot;″s satire of technocracy, bureaucracy, hyper-surveillance, corporate statism, and state capitalism is reminiscent of George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, and it has been called &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; as well as absurdist.

Sarah Street&#x27;s &quot;British National Cinema&quot; (1997) describes the film as a &quot;fantasy/satire on bureaucratic society&quot;, and John Scalzi&#x27;s &quot;Rough Guide to Sci-Fi Movies&quot; (2005) describes it as a &quot;dystopian satire&quot;. Jack Mathews, a film critic and the author of &quot;The Battle of Brazil&quot; (1987), described the film as &quot;satirizing the bureaucratic, largely dysfunctional industrial world that had been driving Gilliam crazy all his life&quot;. Despite its title, the film is not about the country Brazil nor does it take place there; it is named after the recurrent theme song, Ary Barroso&#x27;s &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot;, known simply as &quot;Brazil&quot; to British audiences, as performed by Geoff Muldaur.

Though a success in Europe, the film was unsuccessful in its initial North American release. It has since become a cult film. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted &quot;Brazil&quot; the 54th greatest British film of all time. In 2017, a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine saw it ranked the 24th best British film ever.

==Plot==
In a dystopian, polluted, hyper-consumerist, overbearing, bureaucratic, totalitarian future based on elements of the 20th century, Sam Lowry is a low-level government employee who frequently dreams of himself as a winged warrior saving a damsel in distress. One day, shortly before Christmas, an insect becomes jammed in a teleprinter, which misprints a copy of an arrest warrant it was receiving. This leads to the arrest and death during interrogation of cobbler Archibald Buttle instead of suspected terrorist Archibald Tuttle.

Sam discovers the mistake when he discovers the wrong bank account had been debited for the arrest. He visits Buttle&#x27;s widow to give her the refund where he catches a glimpse of her upstairs neighbour Jill Layton, a truck driver, and is astonished to discover that Jill resembles the woman from his dreams. Sam frantically tries to approach Jill, but she disappears before he can find her. Jill has been trying to help Mrs Buttle establish what happened to her husband, but her efforts have been obstructed by bureaucracy. Unbeknownst to her, she is now considered a terrorist accomplice of Tuttle for attempting to report the wrongful arrest of Buttle.

Meanwhile, Sam reports a fault in his apartment&#x27;s air conditioning. Central Services are uncooperative, but then Tuttle unexpectedly comes to his assistance. Tuttle explains that he used to work for Central Services but left because of his dislike of the tedious and repetitive paperwork, and now works illegally as a freelance heating engineer. Tuttle repairs Sam&#x27;s air conditioning, but when two Central Services workers, Spoor and Dowser, arrive, Sam has to stall to let Tuttle escape.

Sam discovers that Jill&#x27;s records have been classified and the only way to access them is to be promoted to Information Retrieval. He had previously turned down a promotion arranged by his high-ranking mother, Ida, who is obsessed with the rejuvenating plastic surgery of cosmetic surgeon Dr Jaffe. Sam retracts his refusal by speaking with Deputy Minister Mr Helpmann at a party hosted by Ida. After obtaining Jill&#x27;s records, Sam tracks her down before she can be arrested. Sam clumsily confesses his love to Jill, and they cause mayhem as they escape government agents. They stop at a mall and are frightened by a terrorist bombing (part of a campaign that has been occurring around the city), then government agents arrive and take Sam. He awakens briefly detained in police custody.

At work, Sam is chastised by his new boss Mr Warrenn for his lack of productivity. Sam returns home to find that Spoor and Dowser have repossessed his apartment. Tuttle then appears in secret and helps Sam exact revenge on the two Central Services workers by filling their hazmat suits with raw sewage. Jill finds Sam outside his apartment and the two take refuge in Ida&#x27;s unoccupied home, where they share their first kiss. Sam falsifies government records to indicate her death, allowing her to escape pursuit. The two have sex overnight, but in the morning are apprehended by the government at gunpoint. Sam is told that Jill was killed while resisting arrest. Charged with treason for abusing his new position, Sam is restrained in a chair in a large, empty cylindrical room, to be tortured by his old friend, Jack Lint.

As Jack is about to start the torture, Tuttle and other members of the resistance break into the Ministry, shooting Jack, rescuing Sam, and blowing up the Ministry building. Sam and Tuttle flee together, but Tuttle mysteriously disappears amid a mass of scraps of paperwork from the destroyed building. Sam stumbles into the funeral of Ida&#x27;s friend, who has died following botched cosmetic surgery. Sam discovers that his mother now resembles Jill, and is too busy being fawned over by young men to care about her son&#x27;s plight. Government agents disrupt the funeral, and Sam falls into the open casket. Through a black void he lands in a street from his daydreams, and tries to escape police and monsters by climbing a pile of flex-ducts. Opening a door, he passes through it and is surprised to find himself in a truck driven by Jill. The two leave the city together. However, this &quot;happy ending&quot; is a delusion: it is revealed that Sam is still strapped to the torture chair. Realising that Sam has descended into irrecoverable insanity, Jack and Mr Helpmann declare him a lost cause and leave the room. Sam remains in the chair, smiling and singing &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; to himself.

==Cast==
===Main cast===
* Jonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry. Pryce has described the role as the highlight of his career, along with that of Lytton Strachey in &quot;Carrington&quot;. Tom Cruise was also considered for the role.
* Kim Greist as Jill Layton. Gilliam&#x27;s first choice for the part was Ellen Barkin; also considered were Jamie Lee Curtis, Rebecca De Mornay, Rae Dawn Chong, Joanna Pacuła, Rosanna Arquette, Kelly McGillis, and Madonna. Gilliam was reportedly dissatisfied with Greist&#x27;s performance and chose to cut or edit some of her scenes as a result.
* Robert De Niro as Archibald &quot;Harry&quot; Tuttle. De Niro still wanted a part in the film after being denied that of Jack Lint, so Gilliam offered him the smaller role of Tuttle.
* Katherine Helmond as Mrs Ida Lowry. According to Helmond, Gilliam called her and said, &quot;I have a part for you, and I want you to come over and do it, but you&#x27;re not going to look very nice in it.&quot; The make-up was applied by Gilliam&#x27;s wife, Maggie. During production, Helmond spent ten hours a day with a mask glued to her face; her scenes had to be postponed due to the blisters this caused.
* Ian Holm as Mr Kurtzmann, Sam&#x27;s boss
* Bob Hoskins as Spoor, a government-employed heating engineer who resents Harry Tuttle
* Michael Palin as Jack Lint. Robert De Niro read the script and expressed interest in the role, but Gilliam had already promised the part to Palin, a friend and regular collaborator. Palin described the character as &quot;someone who was everything that Jonathan Pryce&#x27;s character wasn&#x27;t: he&#x27;s stable, he had a family, he was settled, comfortable, hard-working, charming, sociable – and utterly and totally unscrupulous. That was the way we felt we could bring out the evil in Jack Lint.&quot;
* Ian Richardson as Mr Warrenn, Sam&#x27;s new boss at Information Retrieval
* Peter Vaughan as Mr Eugene Helpmann, the Deputy Minister of Information

===Supporting cast===
===Cameos===
* Co-writer Charles McKeown as Harvey Lime, Sam&#x27;s co-worker.
* Director Terry Gilliam as the smoking man at Shang-ri La Towers.

==Production==
===Writing===
Gilliam developed the story and wrote the first draft of the screenplay with Charles Alverson, who was paid for his work but was ultimately uncredited in the final film. For nearly 20 years, Gilliam denied that Alverson had made any material contribution to the script. When the first draft was published and original in-progress documents emerged from Alverson&#x27;s files, however, Gilliam begrudgingly changed his story. This was too late for either credit on the film or a listing on the failed Oscar nomination for Alverson; he has said that he would not have minded the Oscar nomination, even though he didn&#x27;t think much of the script or the finished film. Gilliam, McKeown, and Stoppard collaborated on further drafts. &quot;Brazil&quot; was developed under the titles &quot;The Ministry&quot; and &quot;1984 ½&quot;, the latter a nod not only to Orwell&#x27;s original &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; but also to &quot;8½&quot; directed by Federico Fellini; Gilliam often cites Fellini as one of the defining influences on his visual style. During the film&#x27;s production, other working titles floated about, including &quot;The Ministry of Torture&quot;, &quot;How I Learned to Live with the System—So Far&quot;, and &quot;So That&#x27;s Why the Bourgeoisie Sucks&quot;, before settling with &quot;Brazil&quot;, relating to the name of its escapist signature tune.

In an interview with Salman Rushdie, Gilliam stated:
Gilliam sometimes refers to this film as the second in his &quot;Trilogy of Imagination&quot; films, starting with &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981) and ending with &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1988). All are about the &quot;craziness of our awkwardly ordered society and the desire to escape it through whatever means possible.&quot; All three movies focus on these struggles and attempts to escape them through imagination—&quot;Time Bandits&quot;, through the eyes of a child, &quot;Brazil&quot;, through the eyes of a man in his thirties, and &quot;Munchausen&quot;, through the eyes of an elderly man. In 2013, Gilliam also called &quot;Brazil&quot; the first instalment of a dystopian satire trilogy it forms with 1995&#x27;s &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; and 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Zero Theorem&quot; (though he later denied having said this).

Gilliam has stated that &quot;Brazil&quot; was inspired by George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;—which he has admitted never having read—but is written from a contemporary perspective rather than looking to the future as Orwell did. In Gilliam&#x27;s words, his film was &quot;the &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; for 1984.&quot; Critics and analysts have pointed out many similarities and differences between the two, an example being that contrary to Winston Smith, Sam Lowry&#x27;s spirit did not capitulate as he sank into complete catatonia. The film&#x27;s ending bears a strong similarity to the short story &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; by Ambrose Bierce. The tragicomic tone and philosophy of the film bear many resemblances to absurdist drama, a genre for which &quot;Brazil&quot; co-writer Tom Stoppard is widely acclaimed.

===Production design===

Michael Atkinson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; wrote, &quot;Gilliam understood that all futuristic films end up quaintly evoking the naïve past in which they were made, and turned the principle into a coherent comic aesthetic.&quot; In the second version of the script, Gilliam and Alverson described the film&#x27;s setting like this: &quot;It is neither future nor past, and yet a bit of each. It is neither East nor West, but could be Belgrade or Scunthorpe on a drizzly day in February. Or Cicero, Illinois, seen through the bottom of a beer bottle.&quot; In the 1988 documentary &quot;The Birth of Brazil&quot;, Gilliam said that he always explained the film as taking place &quot;everywhere in the 20th century, whatever that means, on the Los Angeles/Belfast border, whatever that means&quot;. Pneumatic tubes are a frequent sight throughout the film.

The result is an anachronistic technology, &quot;a view of what the 1980s might have looked like as viewed from the perspective of a 1940s filmmaker&quot; which has been dubbed &quot;retro-futurism&quot; by fellow filmmakers Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro. It is a mixture of styles and production designs derived from Fritz Lang&#x27;s films (particularly &quot;Metropolis&quot; and &quot;M&quot;) or film noir pictures starring Humphrey Bogart: &quot;On the other hand, Sam&#x27;s reality has a &#x27;40s noir feel. Some sequences are shot to recall images of Humphrey Bogart on the hunt and one character (Harvey Lime) may be named as an homage to &quot;The Third Man&quot; Harry Lime.&quot; A number of reviewers also saw a distinct influence of German Expressionism, as the 1920s seminal, more nightmarish, predecessor to 1940s film noir, in general in how Gilliam made use of lighting and set designs. A brief sequence towards the end, in which resistance fighters flee from government soldiers on the steps of the Ministry, pays homage to the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; (1925). Strong references exist to the overcomplicated humoristic machinery of British illustrator W. Heath Robinson, published between 1915 and 1942. The grotesque sets were based on George Grosz&#x27;s paintings of 1920s Berlin.

The lighting and set design was coupled with Gilliam&#x27;s trademark obsession for very wide lenses and tilted camera angles; going unusually wide for an audience used to mainstream Hollywood productions, Gilliam made the film&#x27;s wide-angle shots with 14mm (Zeiss), 11mm, and 9.8mm (Kinoptik) lenses, the latter being a recent technological innovation at the time as one of the first lenses of that short a focal length that did not fish-eye. In fact, over the years, the 14mm lens has become informally known as &quot;The Gilliam&quot; among filmmakers due to the director&#x27;s frequent use of it since &quot;Brazil&quot;.

Many of the film&#x27;s exterior scenes are filmed in &quot;Les Espaces d&#x27;Abraxas&quot; in Noisy-le-Grand near Paris, a monumental apartment complex designed by Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura.

The numbering of form , without which no work can be done by repairmen of the Department of Central Services, is an allusion to George Orwell&#x27;s flat at 27B Canonbury Square, London (up six half-flights of stairs), where he lived while writing parts of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

===Music===
Geoff Muldaur performed a version of Ary Barroso&#x27;s most famous 1939 song &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; (&quot;Watercolor of Brazil&quot;, often simply called &quot;Brazil&quot; in English). The song is a musical ode to the Brazilian motherland. Michael Kamen uses the song as a leitmotif in the film, although other background music is also used. Michael Kamen&#x27;s arrangement and orchestration of Barroso&#x27;s song for &quot;Brazil&quot; made it more pliable to late 20th-century tastes to the extent that film trailer composers often use it in contexts that have little to do with Brazil and more to do with Gilliam&#x27;s dystopian vision. Kamen, who scored the film, originally recorded &quot;Brazil&quot; with vocals by Kate Bush. This recording was not included in the actual film or the original soundtrack release; however, it has been subsequently released on re-pressings of the soundtrack. Gilliam recalls drawing the inspiration to use the song as follows:
Sylvia Albertazzi, in her article &quot;Salman Rushdie&#x27;s &#x27;The location of Brazil&#x27;. The Imaginary homelands of the Fantastic Literature&quot;, stresses even further the importance that the soundtrack had upon the movie&#x27;s plot and meaning. She suggests &quot;... the opening question &#x27;where is Gilliam&#x27;s Brazil?&#x27;, may be answered, quite literally, &#x27;in a song&#x27;; just as it is in a song that there is to be found that world where &#x27;all fall down&#x27; in children&#x27;s games&quot;.

==Release==
The film was produced by Arnon Milchan&#x27;s company Embassy International Pictures. Gilliam&#x27;s original cut of the film is 142 minutes long and ends on a dark note. This version was released in Europe and internationally by 20th Century Fox without issue. However, US distribution was handled by Universal, whose executives felt the ending tested poorly. Universal chairman Sid Sheinberg insisted on a dramatic re-edit of the film to give it a happy ending, and suggested testing both versions to see which scored higher. At one point, there were two editing teams working on the film, one without Gilliam&#x27;s knowledge. As with the science fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), which had been released three years earlier, a version of &quot;Brazil&quot; was created by the studio with a more consumer-friendly ending.

After a lengthy delay with no sign of the film being released, Gilliam took out a full-page ad in the trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot; urging Sheinberg to release &quot;Brazil&quot; in its intended version. Sheinberg spoke publicly of his dispute with Gilliam in interviews and ran his own advertisement in &quot;Daily Variety&quot; offering to sell the film. Gilliam conducted private screenings of &quot;Brazil&quot; (without the studio&#x27;s approval) for film schools and local critics. On the same night Universal&#x27;s award contender &quot;Out of Africa&quot; premiered in New York, &quot;Brazil&quot; was awarded the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards for &quot;Best Picture&quot;, &quot;Best Screenplay&quot;, and &quot;Best Director&quot;. This prompted Universal to finally agree to release a modified 132-minute version supervised by Gilliam, in 1985.

==Reception==
 On Metacritic, the film received a score of 84 based on 18 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kenneth Turan described the film as &quot;the most potent piece of satiric political cinema since &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was very positive towards the film upon its release, stating &quot;Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Brazil,&quot; a jaunty, wittily observed vision of an extremely bleak future, is a superb example of the power of comedy to underscore serious ideas, even solemn ones.&quot;

Roger Ebert was less enthusiastic in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, giving the film two out of four stars and claiming that it was &quot;hard to follow&quot;. He felt the film lacked a confident grasp on its characters&#x27; roles in a story &quot;awash in elaborate special effects, sensational sets, apocalyptic scenes of destruction and a general lack of discipline&quot;. However, Ebert did say that &quot;there are several scenes in Brazil that show a lot of imagination and effort&quot;. Ebert especially enjoyed one scene in which &quot;Sam moves into half an office and finds himself engaged in a tug-of-war over his desk with the man through the wall. I was reminded of a Chaplin film, &quot;Modern Times&quot;, and reminded, too, that in Chaplin economy and simplicity were virtues, not the enemy.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Brazil&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that it was &quot;a daring, exorbitant Vision, sombrely funny and darkly true.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 2004, &quot;Total Film&quot; named &quot;Brazil&quot; the 20th-greatest British movie of all time. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; film reviewers Richard Corliss and Richard Schickel included &quot;Brazil&quot; in an unordered list of the 100 best films of all time. In 2006, Channel 4 voted &quot;Brazil&quot; one of the &quot;50 Films to See Before You Die&quot;, shortly before its broadcast on FilmFour. The film also ranks at number 83 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Films of All Time.

&quot;Wired&quot; ranked &quot;Brazil&quot; number 5 in its list of the top 20 sci-fi movies. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;Brazil&quot; as the sixth-best science-fiction piece of media released since 1982. The magazine also ranked the film No. 13 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films&quot;.

The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Art Direction (Norman Garwood, Maggie Gray).

According to Gilliam in an interview with Clive James in his online programme &quot;Talking in the Library&quot;, &quot;Brazil&quot; is – to his surprise – apparently a favourite film of the far right in America.

===Home media===
A directors&#x27; cut of &quot;Brazil&quot; was released on LaserDisc in the United States in December 1993. It has also been released several times by The Criterion Collection, as a five-disc LaserDisc set in 1996, a three-disc DVD set in 1999, and a two-disc Blu-ray set in 2012, all with the same special features: a 142-minute cut of the film (referred to by Gilliam as the &quot;fifth and final cut&quot;), Sheinberg&#x27;s 94-minute &quot;Love Conquers All&quot; cut for syndicated television, and various galleries and featurettes.

Criterion also released a one-disc, movie-only edition in 2006, while the three-disc set was revised to be compatible with widescreen televisions.

A Blu-ray of the 132-minute US version of the movie was released in the US on 12 July 2011 by Universal Pictures. It contains only that version of the film and no extra features.

==Legacy==
===Film===
Other films which have drawn inspiration from &quot;Brazil&quot; cinematography, art design, and overall atmosphere include Jean-Pierre Jeunet&#x27;s and Marc Caro&#x27;s films &quot;Delicatessen&quot; (1991) and &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995), Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993), the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994), and Alex Proyas&#x27;s &quot;Dark City&quot; (1998).

The production design and lighting style of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) have been compared to &quot;Brazil&quot;. Tim Burton and production designer Anton Furst studied &quot;Brazil&quot; as a reference for &quot;Batman&quot;.

The ending of Neil Marshall&#x27;s &quot;The Descent&quot; (2005) was greatly inspired by &quot;Brazil&quot;, as Marshall explained in an interview:
&quot;Jupiter Ascending&quot; (2015) features a scene deliberately designed to resemble the bureaucracy in &quot;Brazil&quot;, featuring Terry Gilliam in a cameo role and a reference to a &quot;statute 27B-stroke-6&quot;.

&quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017) was also heavily inspired by &quot;Brazil&quot;, both in its production design and its themes. The planet of Canto Bight is aesthetically similar to &quot;Brazil&quot;. Both films also share several themes, showing the ambivalence of the wealthy in the face of a world falling apart and a society unaware of the conflict surrounding them. A direct reference to the film can be heard when Finn and Rose are arrested for Parking Violation 27B/6, a nod to form 27B/6 without which no work can be done by repairmen of the Department of Public Works.

===Television===
Production design of the Time Variance Authority depicted in the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot; was inspired by the &quot;fun sci-fi bureaucracy&quot; and dystopian design elements of &quot;Brazil&quot; Ministry of Information.

In the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; episode &quot;The Ricklantis Mixup&quot;, the ending of &quot;Brazil&quot; is referenced through a subplot involving a character attempting to escape the wafer factory where he works. He is captured, but lives with the illusion he has escaped, as with Lowry.

===Technology===
The highly technological aesthetics of &quot;Brazil&quot; inspired the set design of Max Cohen&#x27;s apartment in the film &quot;Pi&quot;. &quot;Brazil&quot; also served as an inspiration for the film &quot;Sucker Punch&quot; (2011), and has been recognised as an inspiration for writers and artists of the steampunk subculture.

The dystopian premise of the 2018 video game &quot;We Happy Few&quot; was largely inspired by &quot;Brazil&quot;.

<text>Roanoke Island () is an island in Dare County, bordered by the Outer Banks of North Carolina. It was named after the historical Roanoke, a Carolina Algonquian people who inhabited the area in the 16th century at the time of English colonization.

About long and wide, the island lies between the mainland and the barrier islands near Nags Head. Albemarle Sound lies on its north, Roanoke Sound on the eastern, Croatan Sound on the west, and Wanchese CDP lies at the southern end. The town of Manteo is located on the northern portion of the island, and is the county seat of Dare County. Fort Raleigh National Historic Site is on the north end of the island. The island has a land area of and a population of 6,724 as of the 2000 census.

Today U.S. Highway 64, a major highway, connects mainland North Carolina to the Outer Banks, as well as Roanoke Island. The island has recreational and water features, plus historical sites and an outdoor theater that form one of the major tourist attractions of Dare County.

The residents of Roanoke Island are governed by the Dare County Board of Commissioners. They are located within North Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

==Etymology==
The island was named by English colonists after the Roanoke indigenous people who resided here for generations, at least 800 years prior to the arrival of the English in the New World. The meaning of the word Roanoke is derived from the Powhatan language, which was geographically close to the Roanoke. Roanoke means &quot;white beads made from shells&quot; (or more literally &quot;things rubbed smooth by hand&quot;). White beads were used as ornaments and currency among the Coastal Algonquian peoples of Virginia and North Carolina.

John Smith, an English explorer and one of the first governors of Jamestown, Virginia, recorded the usage of the word &quot;Rawrenock&quot; in the Algonquin Powhowaten language.

Cuscarawaoke, where is made so much &quot;Rawranoke&quot; or white beads that occasion as much dissention among the savages, as gold and silver amongst Christians ...

In the context of the quote, &quot;Rawranoke &quot;refers to the items being traded, not the people. The Roanoke people became known by the English for trading shells prevalent at Roanoke Island and the other barrier islands of the Outer Banks. The Roanoke likely also exported the shells and white beads made from them to other distant cultures across the continent.

==History==

===Overview===
For millennia, this island was a site of ancient indigenous settlements. Archeological excavations in 1983 at the Tillett Site at &quot;Wanchese&quot; have revealed evidence of various cultures dating back to 8000 BC. &quot;Wanchese&quot; was used as a seasonal fishing village for 1500 years before English colonial settlement. Ancestors of the Algonquian-speaking Roanoke are believed to have coalesced as a people in about 400 CE, based on archeology and linguistics.

Roanoke Island was the site of the Roanoke Colony, an English settlement initially established in 1585 by Sir Walter Raleigh. A group of about 120 men, women and children arrived in 1587. Shortly after arriving here, colonist Eleanor Dare, daughter of Governor John White, gave birth to Virginia Dare, the first English child born in North America. Governor White returned to England later that year for supplies.

Due to impending war with Spain, White was unable to return to Roanoke Island until 1590. When he arrived, the colony had vanished. The fate of those first colonists remains a mystery to this day. Much speculation formed about their fate. Archaeologists, historians, and other researchers continue to work to resolve the mystery. Visitors to the Fort Raleigh National Historic Site can watch &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, the second-longest-running outdoor theatre production in the United States, which presents a conjecture about the decline of Roanoke Colony.

Roanoke Island is one of the three oldest surviving English place-names in the U.S. Along with the Chowan and Neuse rivers, it was named in 1584 by Captains Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe, sent by Sir Walter Raleigh.

Another colony, more populous than the 16th century settlement by Raleigh, was developed at the island during the American Civil War. After Union forces took over the island in 1862, enslaved African Americans migrated there for relative freedom. The military considered them contraband and would not return them to Confederate slaveholders. The Army established the Roanoke Island Freedmen&#x27;s Colony in 1863. In part it became an important social experiment, as a chance to develop a community of former slaves. The US government was developing policies related to the future of the formerly enslaved in freedom. Congregational chaplain Horace James was appointed as superintendent of the colony and of other contraband camps in North Carolina. With a view to making it self-sustaining, he had a sawmill built, and freedmen were allotted lands to cultivate. Those who worked for the Army were paid wages. When the United States Colored Troops were founded in 1863, many men from the colony enlisted. A corps of Northern teachers was sponsored by the American Missionary Association, and they taught hundreds of students of all ages at the colony.

===Geological formation and Pre-Columbian settlement===
:&quot;See also Roanoke People and Croatan People&quot;.
The North Carolina Coast began to shape into its present form as the Outer Banks Barrier Islands. Previously, the North Carolina Coast had extended 50 miles eastward to the edge of the continental shelf. The melting of Northern Hemisphere Glaciers at least 14,000 years ago caused sea levels to rise. The Outer Banks and, by extension, the land of Roanoke Island began to stabilize around 6,000 B.C. Roanoke Island was originally a large dune ridge facing the Atlantic coastline and therefore is not a barrier island, contrasting with Bodie Island, which exists 2 miles to the east.

Archaeological discoveries at the Tillett site in Wanchese, North Carolina, have dated the human occupation of Roanoke Island&#x27;s land to 8,000 B.C. At the time, Native Americans across North America were developing in the Archaic Period. Archaeologists discovered that the land of Roanoke Island was part of the Mainland when it was first inhabited by the first Native Americans. For thousands of years, the development of Native American cultures on Roanoke Island corresponded with cultures occurring in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina.

Around the year 400 AD, the area experienced an environmental transformation. The sand dune of Roanoke became disconnected from the mainland by water, and inlets in the Outer Banks turned freshwater sounds (lagoons) into brackish ecosystems. The land termed Roanoke Ridge became Roanoke Island. From approximately 460 AD to 800 AD, the Mount Pleasant Culture had a village on the Tillett Site in southern Roanoke Island, within the modern-day Wanchese township. After the year 800 AD, the village was occupied by the Colington Culture, a predecessor to the historic Roanoke tribe, who were encountered by the 1584 English Expedition.

The Roanoke people of the Tillett site had a semi-seasonal lifestyle: they inhabited the area from early Spring to early Fall, and the village was primarily based on fishing. During this yearly period, inhabitants consumed chiefly shellfish. Oysters and clams were the most common food sources, and the people left middens of shells that demonstrated their consumption. Roanoke women also gathered acorns and hackberry nuts to supplement their diets. The hunting of deer was relatively common, while the consumption of turtles was relatively rare. Lithium used for tools was maintained but not produced on the island and likely came from Bodie Island instead. Roanoke Indians had smoking pipes and used the seeds of plants such as Cleaver and Plantain for medicinal purposes. Four burials have been found at the site of Roanoke Indians of various social positions. The nobility of the culture had their skin and other soft parts of the body removed prior to burial, and after burial, preserved bodies would be transported to a temple. Tooth decay and diseases, including syphilis, were present in the community. It is extremely likely that the Roanoke had similar beliefs to the Virginian Algonquin tribes in that their great warriors and kings lived on in the afterlife, but that commoners lived only a mortal existence.

English maps and written accounts attest to other indigenous villages on Roanoke Island prior to European contact. Englishman Arthur Barlowe described a palisaded town with nine houses made of cedar bark on the far north end of Roanoke Island. According to historian David Stick, this second village was based on hunting land animals. All Roanoke Island villages were likely outlying tributaries of the Secotan&#x27;s capital, Dasamonguepeuk, located on the western shore of the Croatan Sound on the modern-day mainland of Dare County. At the time of contact with the English, the Roanoke were estimated to have numbered from 5,000 to 10,000 members. The Roanoke Tribe, like many other tribes in the area, was loyal to the Secotan. In 1584, Wingina was their king.

===The &quot;lost colony&quot;===

Roanoke Island was the site of the 16th-century Roanoke Colony, the first English colony in the New World. It was located in what was then called Virginia, named in honor of England&#x27;s ruling monarch and &quot;Virgin Queen&quot;, Elizabeth I.

When the English first arrived in 1584, they were accompanied by a Croatoan native and a Roanoke native called Manteo and Wanchese respectively. The two men made history as the first two Native Americans to visit the Kingdom of England as distinguished guests. For over a year they resided in London. On the return journey, the two men witnessed English pirates plundering the Spanish West Indies.

English Scientist Thomas Harriot recorded the sense of awe with which the Native Americans viewed European technology:

Manteo took especially great interest in Western culture, learning the English language and helping Harriot create a phonetic transcription for the Croatoan language. By contrast, Wanchese came to see the English as his captors; upon returning home in 1585, he urged his people to resist colonization at all costs. The legacy of the two Indians and their distinct roles as collaborators and antagonists to the English inspired the names of Roanoke&#x27;s towns.

The first attempted settlement was headed by Ralph Lane in 1585. Sir Richard Grenville had transported the colonists to Virginia and returned to England for supplies as planned. The colonists were desperately in need of supplies, and Grenville&#x27;s return was delayed. While awaiting his return, the colonists relied heavily upon a local Algonquian tribe. In an effort to gain more food supplies, Lane led an unprovoked attack, killing the Secotan tribe&#x27;s chieftain Wingina and effectively cutting off the colony&#x27;s primary food source.

As a result, when Sir Francis Drake put in at Roanoke after attacking the Spanish colony of St. Augustine, the entire population abandoned the colony and returned with Drake to England. Sir Richard Grenville later arrived with supplies, only to find Lane&#x27;s colony abandoned. Grenville returned to England with a Native American he named Raleigh, leaving fifteen soldiers to guard the fort. The soldiers were later killed or driven away by a Roanoke raid led by Wanchese.

In 1587, the English tried to settle Roanoke Island again, this time led by John White. At that time the Secotan Tribe and their Roanoke dependents were totally hostile to the English, but the Croatoan remained friendly. Manteo remained aligned with the English and attempted to bring the English and his Croatoan tribe together, even after the newcomers mistakenly killed his mother, who was also the Croatoan chief. After the incident Manteo was baptized into the Anglican Church. Manteo was then assigned by the English to be representative of all of the Native nations in the region; this title was mainly symbolic, as only the Croatoan nation followed Manteo. John White, father of the colonist Eleanor Dare and grandfather to Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the New World, left the colony to return to England for supplies. He expected to return to Roanoke Island within three months.

By this time, England itself was under threat of a massive Spanish invasion, and all ships were confiscated for use in defending the English Channel. White&#x27;s return to Roanoke Island was delayed until 1590, by which time all the colonists had disappeared. The whereabouts of Wanchese and Manteo after the 1587 settlement attempt were also unknown. The only clue White found was the word &quot;CROATOAN&quot; carved into a post, as well as the letters &quot;CRO&quot; carved into a tree. Before leaving the colony three years earlier, White had left instructions that if the colonists left the settlement, they were to carve the name of their destination, with a Maltese cross if they left due to danger.

&quot;Croatoan&quot; was the name of an island to the south (modern-day Hatteras Island) where the Croatoan people, still friendly to the English, were known to live. However, foul weather kept White from venturing south to Croatoan to search for the colonists, so he returned to England. White never returned to the New World. Unable to determine exactly what happened, people referred to the abandoned settlement as &quot;The Lost Colony.&quot;

In the book &quot;A New Voyage to Carolina&quot; (1709), the explorer John Lawson claimed that the ruins of the Lost Colony were still visible:

Lawson also claimed the natives on Hatteras island claimed to be descendants of &quot;white people&quot; and had inherited physical markers relating them to Europeans that no other tribe encountered on his journey shared:

From the time of the disappearance of the Lost Colony in 1587 to the Battle of Roanoke Island in 1862, Roanoke was largely isolated due to its weather and geography. Sand shoals on the Outer Banks and the North American continental shelf made navigation dangerous, and the lack of a deep-water harbor prevented Roanoke from becoming a major colonial port.

After the failure of the English Roanoke Colony, Native peoples inhabited the island for seventy more years. Archaeology from the Tilliet site indicates that the Roanoke population persisted until 1650. Written accounts indicate visible remnants of the final native presence which survived long after the end of the island&#x27;s native population. A large mound 200 feet tall and 600 feet wide was recorded to exist in Wanchese in the early 1900s; now little evidence remains.

The 1650 extinction date corresponds with the final war between the Powhatan Tribe and the Virginia Colony that took place in 1646. Settlers from Virginia drove the Secotan Tribe out of Outer Banks region.

Survivors of the conflict fled southwards, forming the Machapunga tribe. The Machapunga fought alongside the Tuscarora Indians in the Tuscarora War (1711-1715). After their defeat in the conflict, most Machapunga settled and adapted to English lifestyles around Hyde County, North Carolina, other Machapunga fled northwards to join the Iroquois Confederation. The North Carolina descendants continued to carry some native customs until 1900 and now live in the Inner Banks of North Carolina.

Some in the former Croatoan Tribe went to Hatteras Island prior to 1650, maintained good relations with the English and were granted a reservation in 1759. Descendants of the Croatoan-Hatteras tribes later merged with English communities. The 2000 federal census found that 83 descendants from the Roanoke and Hatteras Tribe lived in Dare County. Others lived in the states of New York, Maryland, and Virginia.
With Roanoke Island open for settlement, English Virginians moved from Tidewater Virginia to Northeast North Carolina&#x27;s Albremarle Region. In 1665, The Carolina Charter established the colony of Carolina under a rule of landowners called the Lord Proprietors. Carolina under its original name &quot;Carolana &quot; included the territory of modern North and South Carolina. Early organized English towns in North Carolina include Elizabeth City and Edenton. Pioneers crossed southwards across the Albremarle Sound to settle in Roanoke Island. They came primarily to establish fishing communities but also practiced forms of subsistence agriculture on the Northern parts of Roanoke Island. Most of the Pioneers had originally immigrated to the American Colonies from Southern English parishes such as Kent, Middlesex and the West Country. Upon the creation of the Royal British Province of North Carolina in 1729, Roanoke Island became part of Currituck County. During the rule of the Lord Proprietors, Roanoke Island had been a part of the earlier Currituck Parish. It was during this time that historical families arrived including the Basnights, Daniels, Ehteridge, Owens, Tillets and others.

Ownership at first belonged to the original Lord Proprietors, who had never visited the area even as Englishmen arrived and began to build houses. The Island was owned by both Carolina Governor Sam&#x27;L Stevens and Virginian Governor Sir William Berkley. Berkley inherited the island by marrying Steven&#x27;s widow in 1670, and then sold the island to Joshua Lamb, a merchant, in 1676. The property was then sold and divided to a series of merchants from Boston (then part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony). Ownership by distant, far-away property holders continued until at least the 1750s. A Bostonian by the name of Bletcher Noyes gave power of attorney of his property to local William Daniels. English legal documents indicate the actual presence of settlers in 1676, with the possibility that the first Englishmen had made permanent homes much earlier.

There were no incorporated towns until Manteo was founded in 1899. From the 1650s to the Civil War period, the Virginia settlers developed a distinct &quot;Hoi Toider&quot; dialect across the Outer Banks. The island was ill-suited for commercial agriculture or for a deep water port and remained isolated with little interference from outsiders. The nearby community of Manns Harbor came into being as a small trading post where goods were transported across the Croatan Sound. Unlike inland North Carolina, the British authorities made no roads within or nearby Roanoke and the Tidewater region of North Carolina was avoided entirely. The development of colonial Roanoke Island also depended on the natural opening and closing of inlets on Bodi and Hatteras Islands to its east. As at other times, the Island was also struck by deadly hurricanes.

During the Revolutionary War there were eight recorded encounters fought in nearby Hatteras, Ocracoke and the High Seas. These battles were between local privateers from Edenton against the British Royal Navy. The Royal Navy often had little place to rest during their coastal patrol duty. On August 15, 1776, a British patrol sent foragers to the now extinct &quot;Roanoke Inlet&quot; in modern-day Nags Head to steal cattle. The Outer Banks Independent Company who was guarding Roanoke Island killed and/or captured the entire party. This battle, while not on Roanoke Island itself, was less than three miles away. Skirmishes involving ships continued until 1780 but no large land battles occurred in the area. Roanoke Island itself was largely spared from war violence and independence for the United States had little effect on local residents.

Thirty years later during the War of 1812 the British Royal Navy planned for an Invasion of North Carolina&#x27;s Outer Banks. The invasion was aborted on Hattaras Island because it was deemed there was nothing worthwhile for the British to occupy or pillage. The force then moved northward to attack Chesapeake Bay communities in Virginia. Roanoke Island continued its isolation until authorities of the Confederate States of America hastily prepared Roanoke Island to defend Coastal North Carolina from the invading Unionist Navy and Army. After passing by Cape Hatteras Union forces attacked Roanoke Island in 1862.

===Civil War years===

&quot;Main Articles: Battle of Roanoke Island and Freedmen&#x27;s Colony of Roanoke Island&quot;

During the American Civil War, the Confederacy fortified the island with three forts. The Battle of Roanoke Island (February 7–8, 1862) was an incident in the Union North Carolina Expedition of January to July 1862, when Brigadier General Ambrose E. Burnside landed an amphibious force and took Confederate forts on the island. Afterward, the Union Army retained the three Confederate forts, renaming them for the Union generals who had commanded the winning forces: Huger became Fort Reno; Blanchard became Fort Parke; and Bartow became Fort Foster. After the Confederacy lost the forts, the Confederate Secretary of War, Judah P. Benjamin, resigned. Roanoke Island was occupied by Union forces for the duration of the war, through 1865.

The African slaves from the island and the mainland of North Carolina fled to the Union-occupied area with hopes of gaining freedom. By 1863, numerous former slaves were living on the fringe of the Union camp. The Union Army had classified the former enslaved as &quot;contrabands,&quot; and determined not to return them to Confederate slaveholders. The freedmen founded churches in their settlement and started what was likely the first free school for blacks in North Carolina.
Horace James, an experienced Congregational chaplain, was appointed by the US Army in 1863 as &quot;Superintendent for Negro Affairs in the North Carolina District.&quot; He was responsible for the Trent River contraband camp at New Bern, North Carolina, where he was based. He also was ordered to create a self-sustaining colony at Roanoke Island and thought it had the potential to be a model for a new society in which African Americans would have freedom.

In addition to serving the original residents and recent migrants, the Roanoke Island Freedmen&#x27;s Colony was to be a refuge for the families of freedmen who enlisted in the Union Army as United States Colored Troops. By 1864, there were more than 2200 freedmen on the island.
Under James, the freedmen were allocated plots of land per household, and paid for work for the Army. He established a sawmill on the island and a fisheries, and began to market the many highly skilled crafts by freed people artisans. James believed the colony was a critical social experiment in free labor and a potential model for resettling freedmen on their own lands. Northern missionary teachers, mostly women from New England, journeyed to the island to teach reading and writing to both children and adults, who were eager for education. A total of 27 teachers served the island, with a core group of about six.

The colony and Union troops had difficulty with overcrowding, poor sanitation, limited food and disease in its last year. The freedmen had found that the soil was too poor to support subsistence farming for so many people. In late 1865 after the end of the war, the Army dismantled the forts on Roanoke. In 1865, President Andrew Johnson issued an &quot;Amnesty Proclamation,&quot; ordering the return of property by the Union Army to former Confederate landowners. Most of the 100 contraband camps in the South were on former Confederate land. At Roanoke Island, the freedmen had never been given title to their plots, and the land was reverted to previous European-American owners.

Most freedmen chose to leave the island, and the Army arranged for their transportation to towns and counties on the mainland, where they looked for work. By 1867 the Army had abandoned the colony. In 1870 only 300 freedmen were living on the island. Some of their descendants still live there.

=== Postbellum period: becoming the seat of Dare County ===
In the aftermath of the Civil War the area which is today Dare County was still split between Tyrell, Currituck and Hyde. Roanoke remained a part of Currituck.

In 1870 Dare County being named after the famous Virginia Dare became independent from the surrounding areas. Originally in April 1870 &quot;The Town of Roanoke Island&quot; was christened as the County Seat. In May of that year the town&#x27;s name was changed to Manteo. The town of Manteo was the first place on in Dare County to have a federal post office. Roanoke Island went from being the outpost of Currituck to being the center of power in the new county. Dare County was allocated lands which included the Mainland, Roanoke Island and the beaches from Cape Hatteras upwards towards Duck.

Outside Interest in the history of the Roanoke Island took hold for the first time. The State of the North Carolina protected the historical Fort Raleigh Site that had been the location of the 1584 and 1585 English expeditions. N.C State Senator Zebulon Vance attempted to build a monument in honor of the Colony in 1886 but was rebuffed by Congress because the bill would have distracted attention from Plymouth, Massachusetts.

The Town of Manteo grew as the center of business in Dare County, though it was not even the largest community in the county at the time. Buffalo City on the mainland had over 3,000 on the mainland but the community faded after the 1930s. Manteo while technically a new town was a combination of estates of landowners who had already resided on the island for two centuries. The organization of the town did spur new growth, as it became a central hub for the area. The waterfront become a bustling port with a network to Buffalo City, Edenton and Elizabeth City. Local fisherman, boat builders and landowners built fortunes whose wealth was later redistributed into new development.

There are five historically registered sites within Downtown Manteo all constructed during the turn of the 20th century. At the time Manteo carried a North American styled Queen Ann architecture combined with unique elements that reflected its coastal Environment. Churches such as Mount Olivet Methodist and Manteo Baptist were early community centers that guided local life. The construction of the island&#x27;s first Court House symbolized the permanence of organized government. Manteo became Roanoke Island&#x27;s only incorporated town in 1899.

As seasonal tourists began to take interest Roanoke became more aligned with the national American culture. In 1917 the Pioneer Theater was established showing movies from around the country, the theater remains in existence as one of America&#x27;s remaining small theaters. The transition from a wholly subsistence to a partial consumer economy began to gradually take place on the eve of the construction of the first bridge.

=== The first bridge ===

The communities of Roanoke were transformed by the construction of the first bridge connecting the island eastwards to Nags Head in 1924. For the first time, automobiles were introduced where travel by water or horse had been previously more common. The Baum bridge marked the first time that higher level infrastructure had been brought to the island. The 1924 bridge would be the only road connection to Roanoke Island for over thirty years. Around the same time, NC 345, Roanoke Island&#x27;s first paved road for automobiles, was built and covered the entire extent of the land from the marshes of Wanchese to the Northend. The north edge of NC 345 corresponded with a ferry that went to Manns Harbor on the mainland. The North Carolina department of transportation subsidized the Roanoke Island ferry in 1934 to lower ticket costs and this was origin of the modern N.C ferry system.

Both Manteo in the north and Wanchese to the south were transformed by the construction of the first Nags Head bridge. Manteo which had previously been a small port reliant on trade with Elizabeth City and Edenton was now connected to a wider transportation network in both the North Carolina and Virginian Tidewater regions. The docks of Downtown Manteo began to decline as the bridge road became the center of commerce. Roanoke Island became industrialized for the first time in Wanchese. In 1936 the Wanchese Fish Cooperation was incorporated by the Daniels family as a processing and packing plant for fish, scallops and shrimp.

As Roanoke was introduced to the national market economy by the bridge, its fishing sales and local economy suffered from the Great Depression. Another blow was dealt in a 1933 Outer Banks Hurricane that made landfall in Hatteras before moving northwards toward Nova Scotia. Over 1,000 people lost their homes across Eastern North Carolina and 24 fatalities were reported. The waterfront of Manteo was destroyed by a severe fire in 1939.

In response to the crisis, the New Deal came to Roanoke Island to provide desperately needed employment and to highlight Roanoke&#x27;s importance to the history of the United States. The outdoor theater play &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; written by Paul Green, began in 1936 and attracted the visit of President Franklin Roosevelt in 1937. The Lost Colony continues its performance every summer season. The onset of WWII with the German declaration of war in December, 1941 affected the island directly.

<text>The Roanoke Colony ( ) was an attempt by Sir Walter Raleigh to found the first permanent English settlement in North America. The colony was founded in 1585, but when it was visited by a ship in 1590, the colonists had inexplicably disappeared. It has come to be known as the Lost Colony, and the fate of the 112 to 121 colonists remains unknown.

Roanoke Colony was founded by the governor Ralph Lane in 1585 on Roanoke Island in present-day Dare County, North Carolina. Lane&#x27;s colony was troubled by a lack of supplies and poor relations with some of the local Native American tribes. A resupply mission by Sir Richard Grenville was delayed, so Lane abandoned the colony and returned to England with Sir Francis Drake in 1586. Grenville arrived two weeks later and also returned home, leaving behind a small detachment to protect Raleigh&#x27;s claim.

A second expedition led by John White landed on the island in 1587 and set up another settlement. Sir Walter Raleigh had sent him to establish the &quot;Cittie of Raleigh&quot; in Chesapeake Bay. That attempt became known as the Lost Colony due to the unexplained disappearance of its population.

During a stop to check on Grenville&#x27;s men, the pilot of the flagship, Simon Fernandes, forced White and his colonists to remain on Roanoke. White returned to England with Fernandes, intending to bring more supplies in 1588. The Anglo-Spanish War delayed his return to Roanoke until 1590, and he found the settlement fortified but abandoned. The cryptic word &quot;CROATOAN&quot; was found carved into the palisade, which White interpreted to mean that the colonists had relocated to Croatoan Island. Before he could follow this lead, rough seas and a lost anchor forced the mission to return to England.

The fate of the approximately 112–121 colonists remains unknown. Speculation that they had assimilated with nearby Native American communities appears in writings as early as 1605. Investigations by the Jamestown colonists produced reports that the Roanoke settlers had been massacred, and there were stories of people with European features being seen in Native American villages, but no conclusive evidence was found.

Interest in the matter fell until 1834, when George Bancroft published his account in &quot;A History of the United States&quot;. Bancroft&#x27;s description of the colonists, particularly White&#x27;s infant granddaughter Virginia Dare, cast them as foundational figures in American culture and captured the public imagination.

==Background==
The Outer Banks were explored in 1524 by Giovanni da Verrazzano, who mistook Pamlico Sound for the Pacific Ocean, and concluded that the barrier islands were an isthmus. Recognizing this as a potential shortcut to China, he presented his findings to King Francis I of France and King Henry VIII of England, neither of whom pursued the matter.

In 1578, Queen Elizabeth I granted a charter to Sir Humphrey Gilbert to explore and colonize territories &quot;unclaimed by Christian kingdoms&quot;. Gilbert had helped to crush the first of the Desmond Rebellions in Ireland&#x27;s Munster province in the early 1570s. The terms of the charter granted by the Queen were vague, although Gilbert understood it to give him rights to all territory in the New World north of Spanish Florida. Led by Gilbert, the English briefly claimed St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, in 1583, as the first English territory in North America at the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I, but Gilbert was lost at sea on his return journey to England.

Following Gilbert&#x27;s death in 1583, Queen Elizabeth divided the charter between his brother Adrian Gilbert, and his half-brother Sir Walter Raleigh. Adrian&#x27;s charter gave him the patent on Newfoundland and all points north, where geographers expected to eventually find a long-sought Northwest Passage to Asia. Raleigh was awarded the lands to the south, though much of it was already claimed by Spain. Richard Hakluyt, however, had by this time taken notice of Verazzano&#x27;s &quot;isthmus&quot; – located within Raleigh&#x27;s claim – and was campaigning for England to capitalize on the opportunity.

Raleigh&#x27;s charter, issued on March 25, 1584, specified that he needed to establish a colony by 1591, or lose his right to colonization. He was to &quot;discover, search, find out, and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands, Countries, and territories ... to have, hold, occupy, and enjoy&quot;. It was expected that Raleigh would establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain.

Despite the broad powers granted to Raleigh, he was forbidden to leave the queen&#x27;s side. Instead of personally leading voyages to the Americas, he delegated the missions to his associates and oversaw operations from London.

==Amadas–Barlowe expedition==


Raleigh quickly arranged an expedition to explore his claim. It departed England on April 27, 1584. The fleet consisted of two barques; Philip Amadas was captain of the larger vessel, with Simon Fernandes as pilot, while Arthur Barlowe was in command of the other. There are indications that Thomas Harriot and John White may have participated in the voyage, but no records survive which directly confirm their involvement.

The expedition employed a standard route for transatlantic voyages, sailing south to catch trade winds, which carried them westward to the West Indies, where they collected fresh water. The two ships then sailed north until July 4, when they sighted land at what is now called Cape Fear. The fleet made landfall on July 13 at an inlet north of Hatorask Island, which was named &quot;Port Ferdinando&quot; after Fernandes, who discovered it.

The Native Americans in the region had likely encountered, or at least observed, Europeans from previous expeditions. The Secotan, who controlled Roanoke Island and the mainland between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, soon made contact with the English and established friendly relations. The Secotan chieftain, Wingina, had recently been injured in a war with the Pamlico, so his brother Granganimeo represented the tribe in his place.

Upon their return to England in the autumn of 1584, Amadas and Barlowe spoke highly of the tribes&#x27; hospitality and the strategic location of Roanoke. They brought back two natives: Wanchese, a Secotan, and Manteo, a Croatan whose mother was the chieftain of Croatoan Island. The expedition&#x27;s reports described the region as a pleasant and bountiful land, alluding to the Golden Age and the Garden of Eden, although these accounts may have been embellished by Raleigh.

Queen Elizabeth was impressed with the results of Raleigh&#x27;s expedition. In 1585, during a ceremony to knight Raleigh, she proclaimed the land granted to him &quot;Virginia&quot; and proclaimed him &quot;Knight Lord and Governor of Virginia&quot;. Sir Walter Raleigh proceeded to seek investors to fund a colony.

==Lane colony==

For the first colony in Virginia, Raleigh planned a largely military operation focused on the exploration and evaluation of natural resources. The intended number of colonists was 69, but approximately 600 men were sent in the voyage, with about half intended to remain at the colony, to be followed by a second wave later. Ralph Lane was appointed governor of the colony, and Philip Amadas would serve as admiral, although the fleet commander Sir Richard Grenville led the overall mission. Civilian attendants included Joachim Gans, metallurgist, Thomas Harriot, a scientist, and John White, an artist. Manteo and Wanchese, returning home from their visit to England, were also passengers on the voyage.

===Voyage===
The fleet consisted of seven ships: The galleass &quot;Tiger&quot; (Grenville&#x27;s flagship, with Fernandes as pilot), the flyboat &quot;Roebuck&quot; (captained by John Clarke), &quot;Red Lion&quot; (under the command of George Raymond), &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (captained by Thomas Cavendish), &quot;Dorothy&quot; (Raleigh&#x27;s personal ship, perhaps captained by Arthur Barlowe) and two small pinnaces.
On April 9, 1585, the fleet departed Plymouth, heading south through the Bay of Biscay. A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated &quot;Tiger&quot; from the rest of the fleet and sank one of the pinnaces. Fortunately, Fernandes had a plan for such an occurrence, wherein the ships would meet up at Mosquetal, on the south coast of Puerto Rico. Proceeding alone, &quot;Tiger&quot; made good speed for the Caribbean, arriving at the rendezvous point on May 11, ahead of the other ships.
While awaiting the fleet, Grenville established a base camp, where his crew could rest and defend themselves from Spanish forces. Lane&#x27;s men used the opportunity as practice for building the fortifications that would be needed at the new colony. The crew also set about replacing the lost pinnace, forging nails and sawing local lumber to construct a new ship. &quot;Elizabeth&quot; arrived on May 19, shortly after the completion of the fort and pinnace.

The remainder of the fleet never arrived at Mosquetal. At least one of the ships encountered difficulties near Jamaica and ran out of supplies, causing its captain to send twenty of his crew ashore. Eventually &quot;Roebuck&quot;, &quot;Red Lion&quot;, and &quot;Dorothy&quot; continued to the Outer Banks, arriving by mid-June. &quot;Red Lion&quot; left about thirty men on Croatoan Island and departed for privateering in Newfoundland. In the meantime, Grenville established contact with local Spanish authorities, in the hopes of obtaining fresh provisions. When the Spanish failed to deliver the promised supplies, Grenville suspected they would soon attack, so he and his ships abandoned the temporary fort.
Grenville captured two Spanish ships in the Mona Passage, adding them to his fleet. Lane took one of these ships to Salinas Bay, where he captured salt mounds collected by the Spanish. Lane again built fortifications to protect his men as they brought the salt aboard. Grenville&#x27;s ships then sailed to La Isabela, where the Spanish set aside hostilities to trade with the well-armed English fleet. On June 7, Grenville left Hispaniola to continue to the Outer Banks.

The fleet sailed through an inlet at Wococon Island (near present-day Ocracoke Inlet) on June 26. &quot;Tiger&quot; struck a shoal, ruining most of the food supplies and nearly destroying the ship. There are indications that Grenville&#x27;s fleet was supposed to spend the winter with the new colony, perhaps to immediately begin using it as a privateering base. The wreck of &quot;Tiger&quot;, however, made that impossible. The remaining provisions could not support a settlement as large as had been planned. Moreover, the shallow inlets of the Outer Banks made the region unsuitable as a base for large ships. The colony&#x27;s top priority would now be to locate a better harbour.

After repairs, &quot;Tiger&quot; continued with the rest of the fleet to Port Ferdinando, where they reunited with &quot;Roebuck&quot; and &quot;Dorothy&quot;. The men left behind by &quot;Red Lion&quot; were presumably also located during this time. On August 5, John Arundell took command of one of the faster vessels and set sail for England, to report the expedition&#x27;s safe arrival.

===Establishment of the colony===
The loss of provisions from the &quot;Tiger&quot; meant that the colony would support far fewer settlers than originally planned. Grenville decided that only about 100 men would stay with Lane, which would be enough to fulfill the colony&#x27;s objectives until another fleet, scheduled to leave England in June 1585, could deliver a second wave of colonists and supplies. However, Grenville could not know that this expedition had been redirected to Newfoundland, to alert fishing fleets that the Spanish had begun seizing English commercial vessels in retaliation for attacks by English privateers. Until a resupply mission could be arranged, Lane&#x27;s colony would be heavily dependent on the generosity of the natives.

While the &quot;Tiger&quot; was under repair, Grenville organized an expedition to explore Pamlico Sound and the Secotan villages of Aquascogoc, Pamlico, and Secotan. His party made contact with the locals, presenting Harriot and White with an opportunity to extensively study Native American society. Although much of their research did not survive the 1586 evacuation of the colony, Harriot&#x27;s extensive survey of Virginia&#x27;s inhabitants and natural resources was published in 1588, with engravings of White&#x27;s illustrations included in the 1590 edition.

Following this initial exploration, a silver cup was reported missing. Believing the item stolen, Grenville sent Amadas to lead a detachment back to Aquascogoc to demand the return of the missing property. When the villagers did not produce the cup, the English decided that severe retribution was necessary in order to avoid the appearance of weakness. Amadas and his men burnt down the entire town and its crops, sending the natives fleeing.
Manteo arranged a meeting for Grenville and Lane with Granganimeo, to provide land for the English settlement on Roanoke Island. Both sides agreed that the island was strategically located for access to the ocean and to avoid detection from Spanish patrols. Lane began construction of a fort on the north side of the island. There are no surviving renderings of the Roanoke fort, but it was likely similar in structure to the one at Mosquetal.

Grenville set sail for England aboard the &quot;Tiger&quot; on August 25, 1585. Days later, in Bermuda, Grenville raided a large Spanish galleon, the &quot;Santa Maria de San Vicente&quot;, which had become separated from the rest of its fleet. The merchant ship, which Grenville took back to England as a prize, was loaded with enough treasure to make the entire Roanoke expedition profitable, spurring excitement in Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s court about Raleigh&#x27;s colonisation efforts.

The &quot;Roebuck&quot; left Roanoke on September 8, 1585, leaving behind one of the pinnaces under the command of Amadas. Records indicate that 107 men remained with Lane at the colony. However, historians disagree as to whether White returned to England with Grenville, or spent the winter at Roanoke despite his absence from the list of colonists.

===Exploration===
Many of the colonists had joined the mission expecting to discover sources of gold and silver. When no such sources were located, these men became dispirited and decided the entire operation was a waste of their time. The English also researched where the local Native Americans obtained their copper, but ultimately never tracked the metal to its origin. The colonists spent the autumn of 1585 acquiring corn from the neighboring villages, to augment their limited supplies. The colony apparently obtained enough corn (along with venison, fish, and oysters) to sustain them through the winter. Little information survives, however, about what transpired at the colony between September 1585 and March 1586, making a full assessment of the winter impossible. The colonists most likely exhausted their English provisions and American corn by October, and the resulting monotony of their remaining food sources no doubt contributed to the men&#x27;s low morale.

Amadas spent the winter exploring Chesapeake Bay, traveling as far as Cape Henry and the James River. While there his party made contact with the Chesapeake villages of Chesepioc and Skicóak. The Secotans had described Skicóak as the largest city in the region, possibly leading the English to expect something like the wealthy Inca and Aztec kingdoms encountered by the Spanish. Amadas instead found a more modest settlement, although he was impressed with the area&#x27;s climate and soil quality. Harriot and Gans explored the Virginia territory, meeting Native American tribes and taking stock of natural resources. During his travels, Harriot and his assistants collected data that would eventually be used to produce White&#x27;s &quot;La Virginea Pars&quot; map.

Although 16th-century science could not explain the phenomenon, Harriot noticed that each town the colonists visited quickly suffered a deadly epidemic, which may have been influenza or smallpox. Some of the Secotan suspected the disease was caused by supernatural forces unleashed by the English. When Wingina fell sick, his own people could not treat him, but he recovered after requesting prayers from the English. Impressed, Wingina asked the colonists to share this power with other stricken communities, which only hastened the spread of disease. The epidemic likely had a severe impact on the fall harvest, at a time when Lane&#x27;s colony would be heavily dependent on its neighbors to supplement its limited food supply.

===Hostilities and food shortages===
By spring, relations between the Secotan and the colony were strained, most likely due to the colony&#x27;s over-reliance on Secotan food. The death of Granganimeo, who had been a powerful advocate for the colony, apparently helped to turn Wingina against the English. Wingina changed his name to &quot;Pemisapan&quot; (&quot;one who watches&quot;), suggesting a newly cautious and vigilant policy, and established a new temporary tribal capital on Roanoke Island. The English did not initially recognize that these developments represented a threat to their interests.

In March, Lane consulted Pemisapan about a plan to explore the mainland beyond Secotan territory. Pemisapan supported the plan and advised Lane that the Chowanoke leader Menatonon was meeting with his allies to plan an attack on the English, and that three thousand warriors had gathered at Choanoac. At the same time, Pemisapan sent word to Menatonon that the English would be coming, ensuring that both sides would expect hostilities. When Lane&#x27;s well-armed party arrived at Choanoac, he found representatives of the Chowanoke, Mangoak, Weapemeoc, and Moratuc. Since this gathering was not planning an attack, Lane caught them by surprise. He easily captured Menatonon, who informed him that it was Pemisapan who had requested the council in the first place.

Menatonon quickly gained Lane&#x27;s trust by offering information about lucrative opportunities in lands the English had not yet discovered. He described a rich and powerful king to the northeast (presumably the leader of the Powhatan), warning that Lane should bring a considerable force if he sought to make contact. Menatonon also corroborated rumors Lane had heard about a sea just beyond the head of the Roanoke River, apparently confirming English hopes of finding access to the Pacific Ocean. The chief&#x27;s son Skiko described a place to the west called &quot;Chaunis Temoatan&quot; rich in a valuable metal, which Lane thought could be copper or perhaps even gold.

Based on this information, Lane envisioned a detailed plan in which his forces would divide into two groups – one traveling north up the Chowan River, the other along the Atlantic coastto resettle at Chesapeake Bay. However, he decided to defer this mission until the colony received fresh supplies, which Grenville had promised would arrive by Easter. In the meantime, Lane ransomed Menatonon and had Skiko sent back to Roanoke as a hostage. He proceeded with forty men for about up the Roanoke River in search of Chaunis Temotan, but they found only deserted villages and warriors lying in ambush. Lane had expected the Moratuc to provide provisions for him along his route, but Pemisapan had sent word that the English were hostile and villagers should withdraw from the river with their food.

Lane and his party returned to the colony shortly after Easter, half-starved and empty-handed. During their absence, rumors had spread that they had been killed, and Pemisapan had been preparing to withdraw the Secotan from Roanoke Island and leave the colony to starve. There was no sign of Grenville&#x27;s resupply fleet, which had not yet even left England. According to Lane, Pemisapan was so surprised that Lane returned alive from the Roanoke River mission that he reconsidered his plans. Ensenore, an elder among Pemisapan&#x27;s council, argued in favor of the English. Later, an envoy for Menatonon informed Lane that the Weapemeoc leader Okisko had pledged fealty to Queen Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh. This shift in the balance of power in the region further deterred Pemisapan from following through on his plans against the colony. He instead ordered his people to sow crops and build fishing weirs for the settlers.

The renewed accord between the English and the Secotan was short-lived. On April 20 Ensenore died, depriving the colony of its last advocate in Pemisapan&#x27;s inner circle. Wanchese had risen to become a senior advisor, and his time among the English had convinced him that they were a threat. Pemisapan evacuated the Secotan from Roanoke, destroyed the fishing weirs, and ordered them not to sell food to the English. Left to their own devices, the English had no way to produce enough food to sustain the colony. Lane ordered his men to break up into small groups to forage and beg for food in the Outer Banks and the mainland.

Lane continued to keep Skiko as a hostage. Although Pemisapan met regularly with Skiko and believed him sympathetic to the anti-English cause, Skiko sought to honor his father&#x27;s intention of maintaining relations with the colony. Skiko informed Lane that Pemisapan planned to organize a war council meeting on June 10 with various regional powers. With the copper the Secotan had gained from trading with the colony, Pemisapan was able to offer substantial inducements to other tribes to side with him in a final offensive against the English. Oksiko declined to get involved, although individual Weapemeocs were permitted to participate. The plan of attack was to ambush Lane and other key leaders as they slept at the colony, and then signal for a general attack on the rest. Based on this information, Lane sent disinformation to the Secotan indicating that an English fleet had arrived, to force Pemisapan&#x27;s hand.

Forced to accelerate his schedule by the possibility of English reinforcements, Pemisapan gathered as many allies as he could for a meeting on May 31 at Dasamongueponke. That evening, Lane attacked the warriors posted at Roanoke, hoping to prevent them from alerting the mainland the following morning. On June 1, Lane, his top officers, and twenty-five men visited Dasamongueponke under the pretense of discussing a Secotan attempt to free Skiko. Once they were admitted into the council, Lane gave the signal for his men to attack. Pemisapan was shot and fled into the woods, but Lane&#x27;s men caught up to him and brought back his severed head. The head was impaled outside the colony&#x27;s fort.

===Evacuation===
In June, the colonists made contact with the fleet of Sir Francis Drake, on his way back to England from successful campaigns in Santo Domingo, Cartagena, and St. Augustine. During these raids, Drake had acquired refugees, slaves, and hardware with the intent of delivering them to Raleigh&#x27;s colony. Upon learning of the colony&#x27;s misfortunes, Drake agreed to leave behind four months of supplies and one of his ships, the &quot;Francis&quot;. However, a hurricane hit the Outer Banks, sweeping the &quot;Francis&quot; out to sea.

After the storm, Lane persuaded his men to evacuate the colony, and Drake agreed to take them back to England. Manteo and an associate, Towaye, joined them. Three of Lane&#x27;s colonists were left behind and never heard from again. Because the colony was abandoned, it is unclear what became of the slaves and refugees Drake had meant to place there. There is no record of them arriving in England with the fleet, and it is possible Drake left them on Roanoke with some of the goods he had previously set aside for Lane. Drake&#x27;s fleet, along with Lane&#x27;s colonists, reached England in July 1586. Upon arrival, the colonists introduced tobacco, maize, and potatoes to England.

===Grenville&#x27;s detachment===
A single supply ship, sent by Raleigh, arrived at Roanoke just days after Drake evacuated the colony. The crew could not find any trace of the colonists and left. Two weeks later, Grenville&#x27;s relief fleet finally arrived with a year&#x27;s worth of supplies and reinforcements of 400 men. Grenville conducted an extensive search and interrogated three natives, one of which finally related an account of the evacuation. The fleet returned to England, leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh&#x27;s claim to Roanoke Island.

According to the Croatan, this contingent was attacked by an alliance of mainland tribes shortly after Grenville&#x27;s fleet left. Five of the English were away gathering oysters when two of the attackers, appearing unarmed, approached the encampment and asked to meet with two Englishmen peacefully. One of the Native Americans concealed a wooden sword, which he used to kill an Englishman. Another 28 attackers revealed themselves, but the other Englishman escaped to warn his unit. The natives attacked with flaming arrows, setting fire to the house where the English kept their food stores, and forcing the men to take up whatever arms were handy. A second Englishman was killed; the remaining nine retreated to the shore, and fled the island on their boat. They found their four compatriots returning from the creek, picked them up, and continued into Port Ferdinando. The thirteen survivors were never seen again.

==Lost colony==

Despite the desertion of the Lane colony, Raleigh was persuaded to make another attempt by Hakluyt, Harriot, and White. However, Roanoke Island would no longer be safe for English settlers, following the hostilities between Lane&#x27;s men and the Secotan, and the death of Wingina. Hakluyt recommended Chesapeake Bay as the site for a new colony, in part because he believed the Pacific coast lay just beyond the explored areas of the Virginia territory. On January 7, 1587, Raleigh approved a corporate charter to found &quot;the Cittie of Raleigh&quot; with White as governor and twelve assistants. Approximately 115 people agreed to join the colony, including White&#x27;s pregnant daughter Eleanor and her husband Ananias Dare. The colonists were largely middle-class Londoners, perhaps seeking to become landed gentry. Manteo and Towaye, who had left the Lane colony with Drake&#x27;s fleet, were also brought along. This time, the party included women and children, but no organized military force.

The expedition consisted of three ships: The flagship &quot;Lion&quot;, captained by White with Fernandes as master and pilot, along with a flyboat (under the command of Edward Spicer) and a full-rigged pinnace (commanded by Edward Stafford). The fleet departed on May 8.

On July 22, the flagship and pinnace anchored at Croatoan Island. White planned to take forty men aboard the pinnace to Roanoke, where he would consult with the fifteen men stationed there by Grenville, before continuing on to Chesapeake Bay. Once he boarded the pinnace however, a &quot;gentleman&quot; on the flagship representing Fernandes ordered the sailors to leave the colonists on Roanoke.

The following morning, White&#x27;s party located the site of Lane&#x27;s colony. The fort had been dismantled, while the houses stood vacant and overgrown with melons. There was no sign that Grenville&#x27;s men had ever been there except for human bones that White believed were the remains of one of them, killed by Native Americans.

Following the arrival of the flyboat on July 25, all of the colonists disembarked. Shortly thereafter, colonist George Howe was killed by a native while searching alone for crabs in Albemarle Sound.
White dispatched Stafford to re-establish relations with the Croatan, with the help of Manteo. The Croatan described how a coalition of mainland tribes, led by Wanchese, had attacked Grenville&#x27;s detachment. The colonists attempted to negotiate a truce through the Croatan, but received no response. On August 9, White led a pre-emptive strike on Dasamongueponke, but the enemy (fearing reprisal for the death of Howe) had withdrawn from the village, and the English accidentally attacked Croatan looters. Manteo again smoothed relations between the colonists and the Croatan. For his service to the colony, Manteo was baptized and named &quot;Lord of Roanoke and Dasamongueponke&quot;.

On August 18, 1587, Eleanor Dare gave birth to a daughter, christened &quot;Virginia&quot; in honor of being &quot;the first Christian born in Virginia&quot;. Records indicate Margery Harvye gave birth shortly thereafter, although nothing else is known about her child.

By the time the fleet was preparing to return to England, the colonists had decided to relocate up Albemarle Sound. The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony&#x27;s desperate situation and ask for help. White reluctantly agreed, and departed with the fleet on August 27, 1587.

===1588 relief mission===
After a difficult journey, White returned to England on November 5, 1587. By this time reports of the Spanish Armada mobilizing for an attack had reached London, and Queen Elizabeth had prohibited any able ship from leaving England so that they might participate in the coming battle.

During the winter, Grenville was granted a waiver to lead a fleet into the Caribbean to attack the Spanish, and White was permitted to accompany him in a resupply ship. The fleet was set to launch in March 1588, but unfavorable winds kept them in port until Grenville received new orders to stay and defend England. Two of the smaller ships in Grenville&#x27;s fleet, the &quot;Brave&quot; and the &quot;Roe&quot;, were deemed unsuitable for combat, and White was permitted to take them to Roanoke. The ships departed on April 22, but the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward-bound voyage (in order to improve their profits). On May 6 they were attacked by French mariners (or pirates) near Morocco. Nearly two dozen of the crew were killed, and the supplies bound for Roanoke were looted, leaving the ships to return to England.

Following the defeat of the Spanish Armada in August, England maintained the ban on shipping in order to focus efforts on organizing a Counter Armada to attack Spain in 1589. White would not gain permission to make another resupply attempt until 1590.

===Spanish reconnaissance===
The Spanish Empire had been gathering intelligence on the Roanoke colonies since Grenville&#x27;s capture of &quot;Santa Maria de San Vicente&quot; in 1585. They feared that the English had established a haven for piracy in North America, but were unable to locate such a base. They had no cause to assume Lane&#x27;s colony had been abandoned, or that White&#x27;s would be placed in the same location. Indeed, the Spanish greatly overestimated the success of the English in Virginia; rumors suggested the English had discovered a mountain made of diamonds and a route to the Pacific Ocean.

Following a failed reconnaissance mission in 1587, Philip II of Spain ordered Vicente González to search Chesapeake Bay in 1588. González failed to find anything in Chesapeake, but on the way back he chanced to discover Port Ferdinando along the Outer Banks. The port appeared abandoned. González left without conducting a thorough investigation. Although the Spanish believed González had located the secret English base, the defeat of the Spanish Armada prevented Phillip from immediately ordering an attack upon it. In 1590, a plan was reportedly made to destroy the Roanoke colony and set up a Spanish colony in Chesapeake Bay, but this was merely disinformation designed to misdirect English intelligence.

===1590 relief mission===

Eventually, Raleigh arranged passage for White on a privateering expedition organized by John Watts. The fleet of six ships would spend the summer of 1590 raiding Spanish outposts in the Caribbean, but the flagship &quot;Hopewell&quot; and the &quot;Moonlight&quot; would split off to take White to his colony. At the same time, however, Raleigh was in the process of turning the venture over to new investors.

&quot;Hopewell&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot; anchored at Croatoan Island on August 12, but there is no indication that White used the time to contact the Croatan for information. On the evening of August 15, while anchored at the north end of Croatoan Island, the crews sighted plumes of smoke on Roanoke Island; the following morning, they investigated another column of smoke on the southern end of Croatoan, but found nothing. White&#x27;s landing party spent the next two days attempting to cross Pamlico Sound with considerable difficulty and loss of life. On August 17 they sighted a fire on the north end of Roanoke and rowed towards it, but they reached the island after nightfall and decided not to risk coming ashore. The men spent the night in their anchored boats, singing English songs in hopes that the colonists would hear.

White and the others made landfall on the morning of August 18 (his granddaughter&#x27;s third birthday). The party found fresh tracks in the sand, but were not contacted by anyone. They also discovered the letters &quot;CRO&quot; carved into a tree. Upon reaching the site of the colony, White noted the area had been fortified with a palisade. Near the entrance of the fencing, the word &quot;CROATOAN&quot; was carved in one of the posts. White was certain these two inscriptions meant that the colonists had peacefully relocated to Croatoan Island, since they had agreed in 1587 that the colonists would leave a &quot;secret token&quot; indicating their destination, or a cross pattée as a duress code.

Within the palisade, the search party found that houses had been dismantled, and anything that could be carried had been removed. Several large trunks (including three belonging to White, containing the belongings he left behind in 1587) had been dug up and looted. None of the colony&#x27;s boats could be found along the shore. The party returned to &quot;Hopewell&quot; that evening, and plans were made to return to Croatoan the following day. However, &quot;Hopewell&quot;″s anchor cable snapped, leaving the ship with only one working cable and anchor. The search mission could not continue given the considerable risk of shipwreck. &quot;Moonlight&quot; set off for England, but the crew of &quot;Hopewell&quot; offered a compromise with White, in which they would spend winter in the Caribbean and return to the Outer Banks in the spring of 1591. This plan fell through, though, when &quot;Hopewell&quot; was blown off course, forcing them to stop for supplies in the Azores. When the winds prevented landfall there, the ship was again forced to change course for England, arriving on October 24, 1590.

==Investigations into Roanoke==

===1552–1602: Walter Raleigh===
Although White failed to locate his colonists in 1590, his report suggested they had simply relocated and might yet be found alive. However, it served Raleigh&#x27;s purposes to keep the matter in doubt; so long as the settlers could not be proven dead, he could legally maintain his claim on Virginia. Nevertheless, a 1594 petition was made to declare Ananias Dare legally dead so that his son, John Dare, could inherit his estate. The petition was granted in 1597.

During Raleigh&#x27;s first transatlantic voyage in 1595, he claimed to be in search of his lost colonists, although he later admitted this was misinformation to cover his search for El Dorado. On the return voyage, he sailed past the Outer Banks, and later claimed that weather had prevented him from landing.

Raleigh later sought to enforce his monopoly on Virginia – based on the potential survival of the Roanoke colonists – when the price of sassafras skyrocketed. He funded a 1602 mission to the Outer Banks, with the stated goal of resuming the search. Led by Samuel Mace, this expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors&#x27; wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering. However, the ship&#x27;s itinerary and manifest indicate that Raleigh&#x27;s top priority was harvesting sassafras far south of Croatoan Island. By the time Mace approached Hatteras, bad weather prevented them from lingering in the area. In 1603, Raleigh was implicated in the Main Plot and arrested for treason against King James, effectively ending his Virginia charter.

===1603: Bartholomew Gilbert===
There was one final expedition in 1603 led by Bartholomew Gilbert with the intention of finding the Roanoke colonists. Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay, but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there. The landing team, including Gilbert himself, was killed by a group of Native Americans for unknown reasons on July 29. The remaining crew were forced to return to England empty-handed.

===1579–1639: John Smith===
Following the establishment of the Jamestown settlement in 1607, John Smith was captured by the Powhatan and met with both their leader Wahunsenacawh (often referred to as &quot;Chief Powhatan&quot;) and his brother Opechancanough. They described to him a place called &quot;Ocanahonan&quot;, where men wore European-style clothing; and &quot;Anone&quot;, which featured walled houses. Later, after Smith returned to the colony, he made arrangements with Wowinchopunk, the king of the Paspahegh, to investigate &quot;Panawicke&quot;, another place reportedly inhabited by men in European dress. The colony produced a crude map of the region with labels for these villages. The map also featured a place called &quot;Pakrakanick&quot; with a note indicating, &quot;Here remaineth four men clothed that came from Roonocok to Ocanahawan.&quot;

In the summer of 1608, Smith sent a letter about this information, along with the map, back to England. The original map is now lost, but a copy was obtained by Pedro de Zúñiga, the Spanish ambassador to England, who passed it on to Philip III of Spain. The copy, now commonly referred to as the &quot;Zúñiga Map&quot;, was rediscovered in 1890.

Smith planned to explore Pakrakanick, but a dispute with the Paspahegh ended the mission before it could begin. He also dispatched two search parties, possibly to look for the other villages reported to him, with instructions to find &quot;the lost company of Sir Walter Rawley&quot;. Neither group could find any sign of the Roanoke colonists living in the area.

By May 1609, word had reached England&#x27;s Royal Council for Virginia that the 1587 colonists had been massacred by Wahunsenacawh. The source of this allegation is unknown. Machumps, Wahunsenacawh&#x27;s brother-in-law, is known to have provided information about Virginia, and he had recently arrived in England. It has been speculated that the same voyage could have also delivered a letter from Smith, although no evidence for this exists.

Based on this intelligence, as well as Smith&#x27;s earlier report, the Council drafted orders for the Jamestown colony to relocate. These orders recommended &quot;Ohonahorn&quot; (or &quot;Oconahoen&quot;), near the mouth of the Chowan River, as a new base. Among the purported advantages of this location were proximity to &quot;Riche Copper mines of Ritanoc&quot; and &quot;Peccarecamicke&quot;, where four of Raleigh&#x27;s colonists were supposed to be held by a chieftain named &quot;Gepanocon&quot;. These orders, along with the new acting governor, Thomas Gates, were delayed due to the shipwreck of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; at Bermuda. Gates arrived at Jamestown in May 1610, several months into the Starving Time. The crisis may have deterred the colonists from attempting the proposed relocation. An expedition was sent to the Chowan River, but there is no record of its findings.

===1610–1612: William Strachey===
William Strachey arrived in Jamestown, along with Gates and Machumps, in May 1610. By 1612, he had returned to England, where he wrote &quot;The Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia&quot;, an overview of the Virginia territory. He described &quot;Peccarecamek&quot;, &quot;Ochanahoen&quot;, &quot;Anoeg&quot;, and &quot;Ritanoe&quot; in a manner consistent with Smith&#x27;s map and the Virginia Council&#x27;s orders to Gates. However, Strachey introduced additional details about &quot;the slaughter at Roanoak&quot;.

Strachey suggested that the lost colonists had spent twenty years living peacefully with a tribe beyond Powhatan territory. Wahunsenacawh, he claimed, carried out the unprovoked attack at the recommendation of his priests, shortly before the arrival of the Jamestown colonists. Based on this account, seven English – four men, two boys, and one woman – survived the assault and fled up the Chowan River. They later came under the protection of a chieftain named &quot;Eyanoco&quot;, for whom they beat copper at &quot;Ritanoe&quot;.

&quot;The Historie of Travaile&quot; never directly identifies the tribe that supposedly hosted the Roanoke colonists. However, Strachey did describe an attack against the Chesepians, in which Wahunsenacawh&#x27;s priests warned him that a nation would arise in Chesapeake Bay to threaten his dominion. It has been inferred that the colonists had relocated to Chesapeake, and both groups were massacred in the same attack.

Strachey believed that the Powhatan religion was inherently Satanic, and that the priests might literally be in communion with Satan. He advocated for England to facilitate the Powhatans&#x27; conversion to Christianity. To that end, he recommended a plan in which King James would show mercy to the Powhatan people for the massacre of the Roanoke colonists, but demand revenge upon the priests. However, the London Company did not publish &quot;The Historie of Travaile&quot;, which fell into obscurity until 1849. There is no indication that any actions were taken against Wahunsenacawh or his priests in retaliation for the alleged massacre.

===1625: Samuel Purchas===
After the Powhatan attacked Jamestown in 1622, there was a dramatic shift in English commentary on Native Americans, as writers increasingly questioned their humanity. The London Company sponsored propaganda arguing that the massacre had justified genocidal retaliation, in order to assure potential backers that their investment in the colony would be safe.

In this context, Samuel Purchas wrote &quot;Virginia&#x27;s Verger&quot; in 1625, asserting England&#x27;s right to possess and exploit its North American claim. He argued that the natives, as a race, had forfeited their right to the land through bloodshed, citing the 1586 ambush of Grenville&#x27;s garrison, an alleged attack on White&#x27;s colonists, and the 1622 Jamestown massacre. Purchas offered no evidence for his claim about the 1587 colony except to state, &quot;Powhatan confessed to Cap. Smith, that hee had beene at their slaughter, and had divers utensills of theirs to shew.&quot;

It is possible Smith related the story of Wahunsenacawh&#x27;s confession to Purchas, as they are known to have spoken together. Smith&#x27;s own writings, however, never mention the confession, leaving Purchas&#x27; claim to stand alone in what historian Helen Rountree dismisses as &quot;an anti-Indian polemic&quot;. Even if taken at face value, the alleged confession is not persuasive, as Wahunsenacawh might have invented the story in an attempt to intimidate Smith. The European artifacts allegedly offered as &quot;proof&quot; of a raid on the Roanoke colonists could just as easily have been obtained from other sources, such as Ajacán.

===1701–1709: John Lawson===
Sea traffic through Roanoke Island fell into decline in the 17th century, owing to the dangerous waters of the Outer Banks. In 1672, the inlet between Hatorask and Croatoan Islands closed, and the resulting landmass became known as Hatteras Island.

During John Lawson&#x27;s 1701–1709 exploration of northern Carolina, he visited Hatteras Island and encountered the Hatteras people. Although there is evidence of European activity in the Outer Banks throughout the 17th century, Lawson was the first historian to investigate the region since White left in 1590. Lawson was impressed with the influence of English culture on the Hatteras. They reported that several of their ancestors had been white, and some of them had gray eyes, supporting this claim. Lawson theorized that members of the 1587 colony had assimilated into this community after they lost hope of regaining contact with England. While visiting Roanoke Island itself, Lawson reported finding the remains of a fort, as well as English coins, firearms, and a powder horn.

==Scientific research==
Research into the disappearance of the 1587 colonists largely ended with Lawson&#x27;s 1701 investigation. Renewed interest in the Lost Colony during the 19th century eventually led to a wide range of scholarly analyses.

===1800s–1950: Site preservation===

The ruins that Lawson encountered in 1701 eventually became a tourist attraction. U.S. President James Monroe visited the site on April 7, 1819. During the 1860s, visitors described the deteriorated &quot;fort&quot; as little more than an earthwork in the shape of a small bastion, and reported holes dug nearby in search of valuable relics. Production of the 1921 silent film &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; and road development further damaged the site. In the 1930s, J. C. Harrington advocated for the restoration and preservation of the earthwork. The National Park Service began administration of the area in 1941, designating it Fort Raleigh National Historic Site. In 1950, the earthwork was reconstructed in an effort to restore its original size and shape.

===1998: Climate research===
In 1998, a team led by climatologist David W. Stahle (of the University of Arkansas) and archaeologist Dennis B. Blanton (of the College of William and Mary) concluded that an extreme drought occurred in Tidewater between 1587 and 1589. Their study measured growth rings from a network of bald cypress trees, producing data ranging from 1185 to 1984. Specifically, 1587 was measured as the worst growing season in the entire 800-year period. The findings were considered consistent with the concerns the Croatan expressed about their food supply.

===2005–2019: Genetic analysis===
Since 2005, computer scientist Roberta Estes has founded several organizations for DNA analysis and genealogical research. Her interest in the disappearance of the 1587 colony motivated various projects to establish a genetic link between the colonists and potential Native American descendants. Examining autosomal DNA for this purpose is unreliable, as so little of the colonists&#x27; genetic material would remain after five or six generations. However, testing of Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA is more reliable over large spans of time. The main challenge of this work is to obtain a genetic point of comparison, either from the remains of a Lost Colonist or one of their descendants. While it is conceivable to sequence DNA from 430-year-old bones, there are as yet no bones from the Lost Colony to work with. And, as of 2019, the project had yet to identify any living descendant.

==Archaeological research==
===1887–present: Archaeological evidence===
Archaeological research on Roanoke Island only began when Talcott Williams discovered a Native American burial site in 1887. He returned in 1895 to excavate the fort but found nothing of significance. Ivor Noël Hume would later make several compelling finds in the 1990s, but none that could be positively linked to the 1587 colony, as opposed to the 1585 outpost.

After Hurricane Emily uncovered a number of Native American artifacts along Cape Creek in Buxton, North Carolina, anthropologist David Sutton Phelps Jr. organized an excavation in 1995. Phelps and his team discovered a ring in 1998, which initially appeared to be a gold signet ring bearing the heraldry of a Kendall family in the 16th century. The find was celebrated as a landmark discovery, but Phelps never published a paper on his findings, and neglected to have the ring properly tested. X-ray analysis in 2017 proved the ring was brass, not gold, and experts could not confirm the alleged connection to Kendall heraldry. The low value and relative anonymity of the ring make it more difficult to conclusively associate with any particular person from the Roanoke voyages, which in turn increases the likelihood that it could have been brought to the New World at a later time.

A significant challenge for archaeologists seeking information about the 1587 colonists is that many common artifacts could plausibly originate from the 1585 colony, or from Native Americans who traded with other European settlements in the same era. Andrew Lawler suggests that an example of a conclusive find would be female remains (since the 1585 colony was exclusively male) buried according to Christian tradition (supine, in an east–west orientation) which can be dated to before 1650 (by which point Europeans would have spread throughout the region). However, few human remains of any kind have been discovered at sites related to the Lost Colony.

One possible explanation for the extreme deficiency in archaeological evidence is shoreline erosion. The northern shore of Roanoke Island, where the Lane and White colonies were located, lost 928 feet (283 m) between 1851 and 1970. Extrapolating from this trend back to the 1580s, it is likely that portions of the settlements are now underwater, along with any artifacts or signs of life.

===2011–present; new archaeological sites===
In November 2011, researchers at the First Colony Foundation noticed two corrective patches on White&#x27;s 1585 map &quot;La Virginea Pars&quot;. At their request, the British Museum examined the original map with a light table. One of the patches, at the confluence of the Roanoke and Chowan rivers, was found to cover a symbol representing a fort at the head of Albemarle Sound. The faint outline of a fort, drawn in what might be invisible ink, was also discovered on the patch itself. One theory is that White may have been trying to conceal the fort from the Spanish, who saw the colony as a threat. The Spanish had sent an expedition to defeat the colony, but could not find the settlers.

As the symbol is not to scale, it covers an area on the map representing thousands of acres in Bertie County, North Carolina. However, the location is presumed to be in or near the 16th-century Weapemeoc village of Mettaquem. In 2012, when a team prepared to excavate where the symbol indicated, archaeologist Nicholas Luccketti suggested they name the location &quot;Site X&quot;, as in &quot;.&quot; In 2015 a team excavated the site, located near a Native American village called Mettaquem.

In an October 2017 statement, the First Colony Foundation reported finding fragments of Tudor pottery and weapons at Site X, and concluded that these indicate a small group of colonists residing peacefully in the area. The challenge for this research is to convincingly rule out the possibility that such finds were brought to the area by the 1585 Lane colony, or the trading post established by Nathaniel Batts in the 1650s. In 2019, the Foundation announced plans to expand the research into land that has been donated to North Carolina as Salmon Creek State Natural Area.

In 2020, new artifacts were found in North Carolina which researchers believe may be from a colony of survivors of the Lost Colony. These were found at a site about fifty miles west of Roanoke Island. Analysis of the artifacts focused on determining whether they might be from the Lost Colony, since later settlers from other colonies such as Jamestown would have different items and different materials than the Lost Colony settlers, such as for example clay pipes, which were invented later. Another researcher found items at a site about fifty miles south of Roanoke Island.

Another dig by Mark Horton, an archaeologist from the University of Bristol, found European artifacts at the site of a Native American village on Hatteras Island, including part of a sword and part of a gun. This may be conclusive proof that the settlers did indeed assimilate with local Native Americans.

In 2020 a book by Scott Dawson was published entitled &quot;The Lost Colony and Hatteras Island&quot; describing his efforts along with Horton to find artifacts relating to the colony. He also wrote articles in publications, including an article in the magazine American Heritage, which described several significant artifacts. these included several objects that seemed to be manufactured by Europeans, including an olive jar, glass and various manufactured items.

==Hypotheses about the colony&#x27;s disappearance==


Without evidence of the Lost Colony&#x27;s relocation or destruction, speculation about their fate has endured since the 1590s. The matter has developed a reputation among academics for attracting obsession and sensationalism with little scholastic benefit.

Conjecture about the Lost Colonists typically begins with the known facts about the case. When White returned to the colony in 1590, there was no sign of battle or withdrawal under duress, although the site was fortified. There were no human remains or graves reported in the area, suggesting that everyone was alive when they left. The &quot;CROATOAN&quot; message is consistent with the agreement with White to indicate where to look for them, suggesting they expected White to look for them and wanted to be found.

===Powhatan attack at Chesapeake Bay===
David Beers Quinn concluded that the 1587 colonists sought to relocate to their original destination – Chesapeake Bay – using the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings. A small group would have been stationed at Croatoan, to await White&#x27;s return and direct him to the transplanted colony. Following White&#x27;s failure to locate any of the colonists, the main body of the colonists would have quickly assimilated with the Chesepians, while the lookouts on Croatoan would have blended into the Croatan tribe.

Quinn suggested that Samuel Mace&#x27;s 1602 voyage might have ventured into Chesapeake Bay and kidnapped Powhatans to bring back to England. From there, these abductees would be able to communicate with Thomas Harriot, and might reveal that Europeans were living in the region. Quinn evidently believed circumstances such as these were necessary to explain optimism about the colonists&#x27; survival after 1603.

Although Strachey accused Wahunsenacawh of slaughtering the colonists and Chesepians in separate passages, Quinn decided that these events occurred in a single attack on an integrated community, in April 1607. He supposed that Wahunsenacawh could have been seeking revenge for the speculative kidnappings by Mace. In Quinn&#x27;s estimation, John Smith was the first to learn of the massacre, but for political considerations he quietly reported it directly to King James rather than revealing it in his published writings. Despite Quinn&#x27;s reputation on the subject, his peers had reservations about his theory, which relies heavily on the accounts of Strachey and Purchas.

===Integration with local tribes===
The possibility that the missing colonists could have assimilated into nearby Native American tribes has been suggested since at least 1605. If this integration was successful, the assimilated colonists would gradually exhaust their European supplies (ammunition, clothing) and discard European culture (language, style of dress, agriculture) as Algonquian lifestyle became more convenient. Colonial era Europeans observed that many people removed from European society by Native Americans for substantial periods of time – even if captured or enslaved – were reluctant to return; the reverse was seldom true. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that, if the colonists were assimilated, they or their descendants would not seek reintegration with subsequent English settlers.

This leaves open the question of which tribe, or tribes, the colonists assimilated into. It is widely accepted that the Croatan were ancestors of the 18th-century Hatteras, although evidence of this is circumstantial. The present-day Hatteras tribe identifies as descendants of both the Croatan and the Lost Colonists by way of the Hatteras.

Some 17th-century maps use the word &quot;Croatoan&quot; to describe locations on the mainland, across Pamlico Sound from Roanoke and Hatteras. By 1700, these areas were associated with the Machapunga. Oral traditions and legends about the migration of the Croatan through the mainland are prevalent in eastern North Carolina. For example, the &quot;Legend of the Coharie&quot; in Sampson County was transcribed by Ernest M. Bullard in 1950.

More famously, in the 1880s, state legislator Hamilton McMillan proposed that the Native American community in Robeson County (then considered free people of color) retained surnames and linguistic characteristics from the 1587 colonists. His efforts convinced the North Carolina legislature to confer tribal recognition to the community in 1885, with the new designation of &quot;Croatan&quot;. The tribe petitioned to be renamed in 1911, eventually settling on the name Lumbee in 1956.

Other tribes purportedly linked to the Roanoke colonists include the Catawba and the Coree. S. A&#x27;C. Ashe was convinced that the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the Chowan River in Bertie County, and Conway Whittle Sams claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Wahunsenacawh, they scattered to multiple locations: The Chowan River, and south to the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers.

Reports of encounters with pale-skinned, blond-haired people among various Native American tribes occur as early as 1607. Although this is frequently attributed to assimilated Lost Colonists, it may be more easily explained by dramatically higher rates of albinism in Native Americans than in people of European descent. Dawson (2020) proposed that the colonists merged with the Croatoan people; he claims, &quot;They were never lost. It was made up. The mystery is over.&quot; However, this conclusion has been called into question. Alain Outlaw, an archaeologist and faculty member at Christopher Newport University, called Dawson&#x27;s conclusion as &quot;storytelling, not evidence-based information&quot;, while archaeologist Nick Luccketti wrote &quot;I have not seen any evidence at Croatoan of artifacts that indicate that Englishmen were living there.&quot; In addition, the actual text of Dawson&#x27;s 2020 book &quot;The Lost Colony and Hatteras Island&quot; admitted that there was no &quot;smoking gun&quot; of evidence that the colonists had assimilated with the tribe. The book was also not subject to peer review, leaving the question open in spite of the sensationalist headlines that accompanied its publication.

An archaeological dig by Mark Horton, an archaeologist from the University of Bristol, found European artifacts at the site of a Native American village on Hatteras Island, including part of a sword and part of a gun. This may be conclusive proof that the settlers did indeed assimilate with local Native Americans.

===Attempt to return to England===
The colonists could have decided to rescue themselves by sailing for England in the pinnace, left behind by the 1587 expedition. If such an effort was made, the ship could have been lost with all hands at sea, accounting for the absence of both the ship and any trace of the colonists. It is plausible that the colony included sailors qualified to attempt the return voyage. Little is known about the pinnace, but ships of its size were capable of making the trip, although they typically did so alongside other vessels.

The colonists may have feared that taking a standard route across the Atlantic Ocean, with a stop in the Caribbean, would place them at risk of a Spanish attack; and thus chosen to attempt a direct course to England instead. Making such a voyage was not unfeasiblein 1563, French settlers at the failed Charlesfort colony on what is now Parris Island, South Carolina built a crude boat and successfully (albeit desperately) returned to Europe. Alternatively, the Roanoke colonists could have sailed north along the coast, in the hopes of making contact with English fishing fleets in the Gulf of Maine.

The pinnace would not have been large enough to carry all of the colonists. Additionally, the provisions needed for a transatlantic voyage would further restrict the number of passengers. The colonists may have possessed the resources to construct another seaworthy vessel, using local lumber and spare parts from the pinnace. Considering that ships were later built by survivors of the 1609 &quot;Sea Venture&quot; shipwreck, it is at least possible that the Lost Colonists could produce a second ship that, with the pinnace, could transport most of their party. Even in these ideal conditions, however, at least some colonists would remain in Virginia, leaving open the question of what became of them.

===Conspiracy against Raleigh===
Anthropologist Lee Miller proposed that Sir Francis Walsingham, Simon Fernandes, Edward Strafford, and others participated in a conspiracy to maroon the 1587 colonists at Roanoke. The purpose of this plot, she argued, was to undermine Walter Raleigh, whose activities supposedly interfered with Walsingham&#x27;s covert machinations to make England a Protestant world power, at the expense of Spain and other Catholic nations. This conspiracy would have impeded Raleigh and White from dispatching a relief mission until Walsingham&#x27;s death in 1590. Miller also suggested that the colonists may have been separatists, seeking refuge in America from religious persecution in England. Raleigh expressed sympathy for the separatists, while Walsingham considered them a threat to be eliminated.

According to Miller, the colonists split up, with a small group relocating to Croatoan while the main body sought shelter with the Chowanoke. The colonists, however, would have quickly spread European diseases among their hosts, decimating the Chowanoke and thereby destabilizing the balance of power in the region. From there Miller reasoned that the Chowanoke were attacked, with the survivors taken captive, by the &quot;Mandoag&quot;, a powerful nation to the west that the Jamestown colonists only knew from the vague accounts of their neighbors. She concluded that the &quot;Mandoag&quot; were the Eno, who traded the captured surviving Lost Colonists as slaves, dispersing them throughout the region.

Miller&#x27;s theory has been challenged based on Walsingham&#x27;s considerable financial support of Raleigh&#x27;s expeditions, and the willingness of Fernandes to bring John White back to England, instead of abandoning him with the other colonists.

===Secret operation at Beechland===
Local legends in Dare County refer to an abandoned settlement called &quot;Beechland&quot;, located within what is now the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. The area has had reports of small coffins, some with Christian markings, encouraging speculation of a link to the Lost Colony. Based on these legends, engineer Phillip McMullan and amateur archaeologist Fred Willard concluded that Walter Raleigh dispatched the 1587 colonists to harvest sassafras along the Alligator River. All records suggesting the colony&#x27;s intended destination was Chesapeake Bay, and that England had lost contact with the colony, were supposedly falsified to conceal the operation from Spanish operatives and other potential competitors.

According to McMullan, Raleigh quietly re-established contact with the colony by 1597, and his sassafras expeditions were simply picking up the colonists&#x27; harvests. In this view, the colony was not truly abandoned until the secret of the colony&#x27;s location died with Raleigh in 1618. After that point, McMullan argued, the colonists would have begun to assimilate with the Croatan at Beechland.

This hypothesis largely depends upon oral traditions and unsubstantiated reports about Beechland, as well as a 1651 map that depicts a sassafras tree near the Alligator River. A significant problem with the hypothesis is that Raleigh supposedly planned a sassafras farm in 1587, to capitalize on a dramatic increase in crop prices, so that he could quickly compensate for the great expense of the failed 1585 colony. The proposed financial motivation overlooks the fact that Richard Grenville&#x27;s privateering recovered the cost of the 1585 expedition. Additionally, sassafras prices did not skyrocket in value until the late 1590s, well after the establishment of the 1587 colony.

===Spanish attack===
Paul Green, while collecting material for a 1937 stage play, noticed that Spanish records from the period contained abundant references to Raleigh and his settlements. Spanish forces knew of English plans to establish a new Virginia base in 1587 and were searching for it before White&#x27;s colonists had even arrived. The Spanish Empire had included most of North America in their Florida claim and did not recognize England&#x27;s right to colonize Roanoke or Chesapeake Bay. Given the Spanish sack of Fort Caroline in 1565, the colonists likely recognized the threat they represented. However, the Spanish were still searching for the colony in Chesapeake Bay as late as 1600, suggesting that they also were unaware of its fate.

===CORA tree===
In 2006, writer Scott Dawson proposed that a Southern live oak tree on Hatteras Island, which bears the faint inscription &quot;CORA&quot; in its bark, might be connected to the Lost Colony. The CORA tree had already been the subject of local legends, most notably a story about a witch named &quot;Cora&quot; that was popularized in a 1989 book by Charles H. Whedbee. Nevertheless, Dawson argued that the inscription might represent another message from the colonists, similar to the &quot;CROATOAN&quot; inscription at Roanoke. If so, &quot;CORA&quot; might indicate that the colonists left Croatoan Island to settle with the Coree (also known as the Coranine) on the mainland near Lake Mattamuskeet.

A 2009 study to determine the age of the CORA tree was inconclusive. Damage to the tree caused by lightning and decay has made it impossible to obtain a valid core sample for tree-ring dating. Even if the tree dates back to the 16th century, establishing the age of the inscription would be another matter.

===Dare Stones===
From 1937 to 1941, a series of inscribed stones were discovered that were claimed to have been written by Eleanor Dare, mother of Virginia Dare. They told of the travelings of the colonists and their ultimate deaths. Most historians today believe that they are a fraud because investigations linked all but one to stonecutter Bill Eberhardt. The first one is sometimes regarded as different from the rest, based on a linguistic and chemical analysis, and as possibly genuine.

==In popular culture==
Raleigh was publicly criticized for his apparent indifference to the fate of the 1587 colony, most notably by Sir Francis Bacon. &quot;It is the sinfullest thing in the world,&quot; Bacon wrote in 1597, &quot;to forsake or destitute a plantation once in forwardness; for besides the dishonour, it is the guiltiness of blood of many commiserable persons.&quot; The 1605 comedy &quot;Eastward Hoe&quot; features characters bound for Virginia, who are assured that the lost colonists have by that time intermarried with Native Americans to give rise to &quot;a whole country of English&quot;.

United States historians largely overlooked or minimized the importance of the Roanoke settlements until 1834, when George Bancroft lionized the 1587 colonists in &quot;A History of the United States&quot;. Bancroft emphasized the nobility of Walter Raleigh, the treachery of Simon Fernandes, the threat of the Secotan, the courage of the colonists, and the uncanny tragedy of their loss. He was the first since John White to write about Virginia Dare, calling attention to her status as the first English child born on what would become US soil, and the pioneering spirit exhibited by her name. The account captivated the American public. As Andrew Lawler puts it, &quot;The country was hungry for an origin story more enchanting than the spoiled fops of Jamestown or the straitlaced Puritans of Plymouth... Roanoke, with its knights and villains and its brave but outnumbered few facing an alien culture, provided all the elements for a national myth.&quot;

The first known use of the phrase &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; to describe the 1587 Roanoke settlement was by Eliza Lanesford Cushing in an 1837 historical romance, &quot;Virginia Dare; or, the Lost Colony&quot;. Cushing also appears to be the first to cast White&#x27;s granddaughter being reared by Native Americans, following the massacre of the other colonists, and to focus on her adventures as a beautiful young woman. In 1840, Cornelia Tuthill published a similar story, introducing the conceit of Virginia wearing the skin of a white doe. An 1861 &quot;Raleigh Register&quot; serial by Mary Mason employs the premise of Virginia being magically transformed into a white doe. The same concept was used more famously in &quot;The White Doe&quot;, a 1901 poem by Sallie Southall Cotten.
The popularity of the Lost Colony and Virginia Dare in the 19th and early 20th centuries coincided with American controversies about rising numbers of Catholic and non-British immigrants, as well as the treatment of African Americans and Native Americans. Both the colony and the adult Virginia character were embraced as symbols of white nationalism. Even when Virginia Dare was invoked in the name of women&#x27;s suffrage in the 1920s, it was to persuade North Carolina legislators that granting &quot;white&quot; women the vote would assure white supremacy. By the 1930s this racist connotation apparently subsided, although the VDARE organization, founded in 1999, has been denounced for promoting white supremacists.

Celebrations of the Lost Colony, on Virginia Dare&#x27;s birthday, have been organized on Roanoke Island since the 1880s. To expand the tourist attraction, Paul Green&#x27;s play &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; opened in 1937 and remains in production today. President Franklin D. Roosevelt attended the play on August 18, 1937 – Virginia Dare&#x27;s 350th birthday.

Bereft of its full context, the colonists&#x27; sparse message of &quot;CROATOAN&quot; has taken on a paranormal quality in Harlan Ellison&#x27;s 1975 short story &quot;Croatoan&quot; and Stephen King&#x27;s 1999 television miniseries &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;. It is also the name of a humanlike villain (portrayed by William Shatner) in the fifth season of King&#x27;s &quot;Haven&quot;. Croatoan also appears in the 2005 television series &quot;Supernatural.&quot; In the 1994 graphic novel &quot;Batman-Spawn: War Devil&quot;, &quot;Croatoan&quot; is the name of a powerful demon who, in the 20th century, attempts to sacrifice the entirety of Gotham City to Satan.

The 2011 &quot;American Horror Story&quot; episode &quot;Birth&quot; relates a fictional legend in which the Lost Colonists mysteriously died, and their ghosts haunted the local Native Americans until a tribal elder banished them with the word &quot;Croatoan&quot;. This premise is expanded upon in the sixth season of the series, &quot;American Horror Story: Roanoke&quot;, which presents a series of fictional television programs documenting encounters with the ghost colonists. The leader of the undead colonists, &quot;The Butcher&quot;, is depicted as John White&#x27;s wife Thomasin, although there is no historical evidence that she was one of the colonists.

In the 2015 novel &quot;The Last American Vampire&quot;, the colonists are the victims of a vampire named &quot;Crowley&quot;; the inscription &quot;CRO&quot; was thus an incomplete attempt to implicate him.

<doc id="74549" wikidata="Q13188" url="?curid=74549" title="Pomegranate">
<text>The pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a fruit-bearing deciduous shrub in the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae, that grows between tall. Rich in symbolic and mythological associations in many cultures, it is thought to have originated from Afghanistan and Iran before being introduced and exported to other parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.

It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769. It is widely cultivated throughout West Asia and Caucasus region, South Asia, Central Asia, north and tropical Africa, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin. The fruit is typically in season in the Northern Hemisphere from September to February, and in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May.

The pomegranate and its juice are variously used in baking, cooking, juice blends, garnishes, non-alcoholic drinks, and cocktails.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;pomegranate&quot; derives from medieval Latin &#x27;apple&#x27; and &#x27;seeded&#x27;. Possibly stemming from the old French word for the fruit, , the pomegranate was known in early English as &quot;apple of Granada&quot;—a term which today survives only in heraldic blazons. This is a folk etymology, confusing the Latin &quot;granatus&quot; with the name of the Spanish city of Granada, which is derived from an unrelated Arabic word.

Garnet derives from Old French by metathesis, from Medieval Latin as used in a different meaning &#x27;of a dark red color&#x27;. This derivation may have originated from &quot;pomum granatum&quot;, describing the color of pomegranate pulp, or from &quot;granum&quot;, referring to &#x27;red dye, cochineal&#x27;.

The modern French term for pomegranate, , has given its name to the military grenade.

Pomegranates were colloquially called &quot;wineapples&quot; or &quot;wine-apples&quot; in Ireland, although this term has fallen out of use. It still persists at the Moore Street open-air market, in central Dublin.

== Description ==
The pomegranate is a shrub or small tree growing high, with multiple spiny branches. It is long-lived, with some specimens in France surviving for 200 years. &quot;P. granatum&quot; leaves are opposite or subopposite, glossy, narrow oblong, entire, long and broad. The flowers are bright red and in diameter, with three to seven petals. Some fruitless varieties are grown for the flowers alone.
===Fruit===

The pomegranate fruit husk is red-purple with an outer, hard pericarp, and an inner, spongy mesocarp (white &quot;albedo&quot;), which comprises the fruit&#x27;s inner wall where seeds attach. Membranes of the mesocarp are organized as nonsymmetric chambers that contain seeds which are embedded without attachment to the mesocarp. Pomegranate seeds are characterized by having sarcotesta, thick fleshy seed coats derived from the integuments or outer layers of the ovule&#x27;s epidermal cells. The number of seeds in a pomegranate can vary from 200 to about 1,400.

Botanically, the fruit is a berry with edible seeds and pulp produced from the ovary of a single flower. The fruit is intermediate in size between a lemon and a grapefruit, in diameter with a rounded shape and thick, reddish husk.

In mature fruits, the juice obtained by compressing the seeds yields a tart flavor due to low pH (4.4) and high contents of polyphenols, which may cause a red indelible stain on fabrics. The pigmentation of pomegranate juice primarily results from the presence of anthocyanins and ellagitannins.

== Cultivation ==
&quot;P. granatum&quot; is grown for its vegetable crop, and as ornamental trees and shrubs in parks and gardens. Mature specimens can develop sculptural twisted bark, multiple trunks, and a distinctive overall form. Pomegranates are drought-tolerant, and can be grown in dry areas with either a Mediterranean winter rainfall climate or in summer rainfall climates. In wetter areas, they can be prone to root decay from fungal diseases. They can tolerate moderate frost, down to about .

Insect pests of the pomegranate can include the butterflies &quot;Virachola isocrates&quot;, &quot;Iraota timoleon&quot;, &quot;Deudorix epijarbas&quot;, and the leaf-footed bug &quot;Leptoglossus zonatus&quot;, and fruit flies and ants are attracted to unharvested ripe fruit. 

=== Propagation ===
&quot;P. granatum&quot; reproduces sexually in nature but can be propagated using asexual reproduction. Propagation methods include layering, hardwood cuttings, softwood cuttings and tissue culture. Required conditions for rooting cuttings include warm temperatures within the 18 - 29 °C (65 - 85 °F) range and a semi-humid environment. Rooting hormone increases rooting success rate but is not required. Grafting is possible but impractical and tends to yield low success rates.

=== Varieties ===
&quot;P. granatum&quot; var. &quot;nana&quot; is a dwarf variety of &quot;P. granatum&quot; popularly planted as an ornamental plant in gardens and larger containers, and used as a bonsai specimen tree. It could well be a wild form with a distinct origin. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The only other species in the genus &quot;Punica&quot; is the Socotran pomegranate (&quot;P. protopunica&quot;), which is endemic to the Socotran archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea, the largest island of which is also known as Socotra. The territory is part of Yemen. It differs in having pink (not red) flowers and smaller, less sweet fruit.

=== Cultivars ===

&quot;P. granatum&quot; has more than 500 named cultivars, but has considerable synonymy in which the same genotype is named differently across regions of the world.

Several characteristics between pomegranate genotypes vary for identification, consumer preference, preferred use, and marketing, the most important of which are fruit size, exocarp color (ranging from yellow to purple, with pink and red most common), seed-coat color (ranging from white to red), the hardness of seed, maturity, juice content and its acidity, sweetness, and astringency.

==Production and export==
The leading producers globally are India and China, followed by Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the US, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, and Spain.
During 2019, Chile, Peru, Egypt, Israel, India, and Turkey supplied pomegranates to the European market. Chile was the main supplier to the United States market, which has a limited supply from Southern California. China was self-sufficient for its pomegranate supply in 2019, while other South Asia markets were supplied mainly by India. Pomegranate production and exports in South Africa competed with South American shipments in 2012–18, with export destinations including Europe, the Middle East, the United Kingdom, and Russia. South Africa imports pomegranates mainly from Israel.

== History ==

The pomegranate is native to a region from modern-day Iran to northern India. Pomegranates have been cultivated throughout the Middle East, India, and the Mediterranean region for several millennia, and it is also cultivated in the Central Valley of California and in Arizona. Pomegranates may have been domesticated as early as the fifth millennium BC, as they were one of the first fruit trees to be domesticated in the eastern Mediterranean region.

Carbonized exocarp of the fruit has been identified in early Bronze Age levels of Tell es-Sultan (Jericho) in the West Bank, as well as late Bronze Age levels of Hala Sultan Tekke on Cyprus and Tiryns. A large, dry pomegranate was found in the tomb of Djehuty, the butler of Queen Hatshepsut in Egypt; Mesopotamian records written in cuneiform mention pomegranates from the mid-third millennium BC onwards.

Waterlogged pomegranate remains have been identified at the circa 14th century BC Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey. Other goods on the ship include perfume, ivory and gold jewelry, suggesting that pomegranates at this time may have been considered a luxury good. Other archaeological finds of pomegranate remains from the Late Bronze Age have been found primarily in elite residences, supporting this inference.

It is also extensively grown in southern China and Southeast Asia, whether originally spread along the Silk Road route or brought by sea traders. Kandahar is famous in Afghanistan for its high-quality pomegranates.

Although not native to Korea or Japan, the pomegranate is widely grown there and many cultivars have been developed. It is widely used for bonsai because of its flowers and for the unusual twisted bark the older specimens can attain. The term &quot;balaustine&quot; () is also used for a pomegranate-red color.

Spanish colonists later introduced the fruit to the Caribbean and America (Spanish America). However, in the English colonies, it was less at home: &quot;Don&#x27;t use the pomegranate inhospitably, a stranger that has come so far to pay his respects to thee,&quot; the English Quaker Peter Collinson wrote to the botanizing John Bartram in Philadelphia, 1762. &quot;Plant it against the side of thy house, nail it close to the wall. In this manner it thrives wonderfully with us, and flowers beautifully, and bears fruit this hot year. I have twenty-four on one tree... Doctor Fothergill says, of all trees this is most salutiferous to mankind.&quot;

The pomegranate had been introduced as an exotic to England the previous century, by John Tradescant the Elder, but the disappointment that it did not set fruit there led to its repeated introduction to the American colonies, even New England. It succeeded in the South: Bartram received a barrel of pomegranates and oranges from a correspondent in Charleston, South Carolina, 1764. John Bartram partook of &quot;delitious&quot; pomegranates with Noble Jones at Wormsloe Plantation, near Savannah, Georgia, in September 1765. Thomas Jefferson planted pomegranates at Monticello in 1771; he had them from George Wythe of Williamsburg.

==Use==
===Culinary===

Pomegranate juice can be sweet or sour, but most fruits are moderate in taste, with sour notes from the acidic ellagitannins contained in the juice. Pomegranate juice has long been a common drink in Europe and the Middle East, and is distributed worldwide. Pomegranate juice is also used as a cooking ingredient. In Syria, pomegranate juice is added to intensify the flavor of some dishes such as kibbeh safarjaliyeh.

Grenadine syrup, commonly used in cocktail, originally consisted of thickened and sweetened pomegranate juice, but today is typically a syrup made just of sugar and commercially produced natural and artificial flavors, preservatives, and food coloring, or using substitute fruits (such as berries).

Before tomatoes (a New World fruit) arrived in the Middle East, pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses, and vinegar were widely used in many Iranian foods; this mixture still found in traditional recipes such as &quot;fesenjān&quot;, a thick sauce made from pomegranate juice and ground walnuts, usually spooned over duck or other poultry and rice, and in &quot;ash-e anar&quot; (pomegranate soup).

Pomegranate seeds are used as a spice known as &quot;anar dana&quot; (from , pomegranate + seed), most notably in Indian and Pakistani cuisine. Dried whole seeds can often be obtained in ethnic Indian markets. These seeds are separated from the flesh, dried for 10–15 days, and used as an acidic agent for chutney and curry preparation. Ground &quot;anardana&quot; is also used, which results in deeper flavoring in dishes and prevents the seeds from getting stuck in teeth. Seeds of the wild pomegranate variety known as &quot;daru&quot; from the Himalayas are considered high-quality sources for this spice.

Dried pomegranate seeds, found in some natural specialty food markets, still contain some residual water, maintaining a natural sweet and tart flavor. Dried seeds can be used in several culinary applications, such as trail mix, granola bars, or as a topping for salad, yogurt, or ice cream.

In Turkey, pomegranate sauce () is used as a salad dressing, to marinate meat, or simply to drink straight. Pomegranate seeds are also used in salads and sometimes as garnish for desserts such as &quot;güllaç&quot;. Pomegranate syrup, also called pomegranate molasses, is used in &quot;muhammara&quot;, a roasted red pepper, walnut, and garlic spread popular in Syria and Turkey.

In Greece, pomegranate is used in many recipes, including &quot;kollivozoumi&quot;, a creamy broth made from boiled wheat, pomegranates, and raisins, legume salad with wheat and pomegranate, traditional Middle Eastern lamb kebabs with pomegranate glaze, pomegranate eggplant relish, and avocado-pomegranate dip. Pomegranate is also made into a liqueur, and as a popular fruit confectionery used as ice cream topping, mixed with yogurt, or spread as jam on toast.

In Mexico, pomegranate seeds are commonly used to adorn the traditional dish &quot;chiles en nogada&quot;, representing the red of the Mexican flag in the dish which evokes the green (poblano pepper), white (&quot;nogada&quot; sauce) and red (pomegranate seeds) tricolor.

===Other uses===
Pomegranate peels may be used to stain wool and silk in the carpet industry.

== Nutrition ==

The edible portion of raw pomegranate is 78% water, 19% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat (table). A serving of pomegranate sarcotesta provides 12% of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin C, 16% DV for vitamin K, and 10% DV for folate (table), while the seeds are a rich source of dietary fiber (20% DV).

== Research ==
=== Phytochemicals ===

==== Processing ====
The phenolic content of pomegranate juice is degraded by processing and pasteurization techniques.

==== Juice ====
The most abundant phytochemicals in pomegranate juice are polyphenols, including the hydrolyzable tannins called ellagitannins formed when ellagic acid and gallic acid bind with a carbohydrate to form pomegranate ellagitannins, also known as punicalagins. The red color of the juice is attributed to anthocyanins, such as delphinidin, cyanidin, and glycosides of pelargonidin. Generally, an increase in juice pigmentation occurs during fruit ripening.

==== Peel ====
Pomegranate peel contains high amount of polyphenols, condensed tannins, catechins, and prodelphinidins. The higher phenolic content of the peel yields extracts for use in dietary supplements and food preservatives.

==== Seed ====
Pomegranate seed oil contains punicic acid (65%), palmitic acid (5%), stearic acid (2%), oleic acid (6%), and linoleic acid (7%).

=== Health claims ===
Despite limited research data, manufacturers and marketers of pomegranate juice have liberally used results from preliminary research to promote products. In February 2010, the FDA issued a warning letter to one such manufacturer, POM Wonderful, for using published literature to make illegal claims of unproven anti-disease effects.

In May 2016, the US Federal Trade Commission declared that POM Wonderful could not make health claims in its advertising, followed by a US Supreme Court ruling that declined a request by POM Wonderful to review the court ruling, upholding the FTC decision.

== Symbolism ==
===Ancient Iran===
Pomegranate, known as in Persian, is a symbol of fertility, blessing, and favor in Iranian belief. Pomegranates are sacred in the Zoroastrian religion and Zoroastrians used it in their religious rituals. The yellow color of the pomegranate stamens symbolizes the sun and light.

The pomegranate tree has been one of the most sacred and holy plants in Iran and is believed to be grown from places where the blood of Siavash (the legendary Iranian character who is known for his innocence) was spilled. It has been mentioned in Iranian Pahlavi scripts as a fruit of heaven. It is also believed that the invulnerability of Esfandiar (Iranian legend) was related to this sacred fruit. The Zoroastrians of Iran believe that pomegranate is a blessed fruit as it is served in their festivals like Mehregan and Nowruz, and especially in their wedding ceremonies to wish for the newly married couple to have healthy children in the future. They also used to plant a pomegranate tree in their fire temples to use its leaves in their ceremonies.

During the Iranian tradition, Yalda Night, people come together on winter solstice and eat pomegranate fruit to celebrate the victory of light over darkness.
In a relief from Persepolis, Darius the Great is holding a pomegranate flower with two buds. This Achaemenid king is accepting the representatives of all the subordinate lands of Greater Iran to his presence, while holding a large flower in his hand as a sign of peace and friendship.

=== Ancient Egypt ===
Ancient Egyptians regarded the pomegranate as a symbol of prosperity and ambition. It was referred to by the Semitic names of &quot;jnhm&quot; or &quot;nhm&quot;. According to the Ebers Papyrus, one of the oldest medical writings from around 1500 BC, Egyptians used the pomegranate for treatment of tapeworm and other infections.

===Ancient and modern Greece===
A pomegranate is displayed on coins from Side, as &quot;Side&quot; was the name for &quot;pomegranate&quot; in the local language, which is the city&#x27;s name.&lt;ref name=&quot;ma-shops/2135&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vcoins/1562290&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NumisBids/1668/1114&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wildwinds/pamphylia/side/i&quot;&gt;
* Side, Pamphylia, AE16. ca. 310-380 BC. Helmeted head of Athena right. / ΣIΔH, pomegranate on a stalk, caduceus to left. SNG France III 772; SNG Pfalz 487-488 cngcoins.com, auction 145, lot 108, Aug. 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greek city of Side was in Pamphylia, a former region on the southern Mediterranean coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Antalya province, Turkey).

The Greeks were familiar with the fruit far before it was introduced to Rome via Carthage, and it figures in multiple myths and artworks. In Ancient Greek mythology, the pomegranate was known as the &quot;fruit of the dead&quot;, and believed to have sprung from the blood of Adonis.

The myth of Persephone, the goddess of the underworld, prominently features her consumption of pomegranate seeds, requiring her to spend a certain number of months in the underworld every year. The number of seeds and therefore months vary. During the months that Persephone sits on the throne of the underworld beside her husband Hades, her mother Demeter mourns and no longer gives fertility to the earth. This was an ancient Greek explanation for the seasons.

According to Carl A. P. Ruck and Danny Staples, the chambered pomegranate is also a surrogate for the poppy&#x27;s narcotic capsule, with its comparable shape and chambered interior.

In another Greek myth, a girl named Side (&quot;pomegranate&quot;) killed herself on her mother&#x27;s grave to avoid suffering rape at the hands of her own father Ictinus. Her blood transformed into a pomegranate tree.

In the fifth century BC, Polycleitus took ivory and gold to sculpt the seated Argive Hera in her temple. She held a scepter in one hand and offered a pomegranate, like a &quot;royal orb&quot;, in the other. &quot;About the pomegranate I must say nothing,&quot; whispered the traveller Pausanias in the second century, &quot;for its story is somewhat of a holy mystery&quot;. The pomegranate has a calyx shaped like a crown. In Jewish tradition, it has been seen as the original &quot;design&quot; for the proper crown.

Within the Heraion at the mouth of the Sele, near Paestum, Magna Graecia, is a chapel devoted to the &quot;Madonna del Granato&quot;, &quot;Our Lady of the Pomegranate&quot;, &quot;who by virtue of her epithet and the attribute of a pomegranate must be the Christian successor of the ancient Greek goddess Hera&quot;, observes the excavator of the Heraion of Samos, Helmut Kyrieleis.

In modern times, the pomegranate still holds strong symbolic meanings for the Greeks. When one buys a new home, it is conventional for a house guest to bring as a first gift a pomegranate, which is placed under/near the &quot;ikonostasi&quot; (home altar) of the house, as a symbol of abundance, fertility, and good luck. When Greeks commemorate their dead, they make &quot;kollyva&quot; as offerings, which consist of boiled wheat, mixed with sugar and decorated with pomegranate. Pomegranate decorations for the home are very common in Greece and sold in most home goods stores.

===Ancient Israel and Judaism===
====Hebrew Bible====
Some Jewish scholars believe the pomegranate was the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.

Pomegranates were known in Ancient Israel as the fruits that the scouts brought to Moses to demonstrate the fertility of the &quot;Promised Land&quot;. The Book of Exodus describes the &quot;me&#x27;il&quot; (&quot;robe of the ephod&quot;) worn by the Hebrew high priest as having pomegranates embroidered on the hem, alternating with golden bells, which could be heard as the high priest entered and left the Holy of Holies. According to the Books of Kings, the capitals of the two pillars (Jachin and Boaz) that stood in front of Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem were engraved with pomegranates. Solomon is said to have designed his coronet based on the pomegranate&#x27;s &quot;crown&quot; (calyx).

Pomegranates are one of the Seven Species (Hebrew: שבעת המינים, &quot;Shiv&#x27;at Ha-Minim&quot;) of fruits and grains enumerated in the Hebrew Bible () as special products of the Land of Israel, and the Songs of Solomon mentions pomegranate six times and contains this particular quote: &quot;Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.&quot; ().

====Historical and traditional use====

The pomegranate appeared on the ancient coins of Judaea, see Hasmonean, Herodian and First Jewish Revolt coinage.

The handles of Torah scrolls, when not in use, are sometimes covered with decorative silver globes similar in shape to pomegranates (&quot;Torah rimmonim&quot;).

Consuming pomegranates on Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, is traditional because, with its numerous seeds, it symbolizes fruitfulness.

====Talmud and Kabbalah====
The pomegranate is said to have 613 seeds representing the 613 commandments of the Torah, but it is a misconception. There is no clear source for this claim, although it is used as a metaphor in the Talmud for numerous good deeds.

=== In European Christian motifs ===
In the earliest incontrovertible appearance of Christ in a mosaic, a fourth-century floor mosaic from Hinton St Mary, Dorset, now in the British Museum, the bust of Christ and the chi rho are flanked by pomegranates.
Pomegranates continue to be a motif often found in Christian religious decoration. They are often woven into the fabric of vestments and liturgical hangings or wrought in metalwork. Pomegranates figure in many religious paintings by the likes of Sandro Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci, often in the hands of the Virgin Mary or the infant Jesus. The fruit, broken or bursting open, is a symbol of the fullness of Jesus&#x27; suffering and resurrection.

=== In Islam ===
Chapter 55 of the Quran mentions the pomegranate as a &quot;favour&quot; among many to be offered to those fearful to the &quot;Lord&quot; in &quot;two Gardens&quot;.

=== Armenia ===

The pomegranate is one of the main fruits in Armenian culture (alongside apricots and grapes). Its juice is used with Armenian food and wine. The pomegranate is a symbol in Armenia, representing fertility, abundance, and marriage. It is also a semireligious icon. For example, the fruit played an integral role in a wedding custom widely practiced in ancient Armenia; a bride was given a pomegranate fruit, which she threw against a wall, breaking it into pieces. Scattered pomegranate seeds ensured the bride&#x27;s future children.

&quot;The Color of Pomegranates&quot;, a movie directed by Sergei Parajanov, is a biography of the Armenian&quot; ashug&quot; Sayat-Nova (King of Song) which attempts to reveal the poet&#x27;s life visually and poetically rather than literally.

=== Azerbaijan ===

Every fall the Goychay Pomegranate Festival is held in the city of Goychay.

=== China ===
Introduced to China during the Han dynasty (206BC–220AD), the pomegranate (), in older times, was considered an emblem of fertility and numerous progeny. Pictures of the ripe fruit with the seeds bursting forth were often hung in homes to bestow fertility and bless the dwelling with numerous offspring, an important facet of traditional Chinese culture.

In modern times, the pomegranate has been used to symbolise national cohesion and ethnic unity by Xi Jinping, urging the Chinese population to &quot;stick together like pomegranate seeds&quot;.

=== India ===
In some Hindu traditions, the pomegranate (Sanskrit: &quot;dāḍima&quot;) symbolizes prosperity and fertility, and is associated with both Bhumi (the earth goddess) and Ganesha (the one fond of the many-seeded fruit).

===Kurdish culture===
The pomegranate is an important fruit and symbol in Kurdish culture. It is accepted as a symbol of abundance and a sacred fruit of ancient Kurdish religions. Pomegranate is used as a symbol of abundance in Kurdish carpets.

<text>Yelena Viktorovna Davydova (; born 7 August 1961) is a Russian-Canadian gymnastics coach and judge who competed for the former Soviet Union. She was the women&#x27;s artistic individual all-around champion at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. She&#x27;s the owner and head coach at Gemini Gymnastics, a gymnastics club in Oshawa, Ontario. In July 2012, Davydova was one of the coaches of the Canadian Women&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics Team. In 2016 Davydova was head floor judge at the 2016 Rio Olympics.

In October 2016, she was elected a member of the International Gymnastics Federation&#x27;s Women Technical Committee.

==Early life==
Davydova was born in Voronezh, 500 kilometres south of Moscow, to Victor, a mechanic, and Tamara, an employee at the &quot;Leningrad Optical and Mechanical Works&quot;. She became interested in gymnastics at age six after seeing on television the famous Soviet Olympic gold medallists Larisa Petrik and Natalia Kuchinskaya. She wanted to be enrolled in &quot;Spartak&quot; Gymnastics school, but was turned away for having the wrong physique.

Soon a coach at the school, Gennadiy Korshunov, noticed her. He invited her into the school. He asked his wife, Ina, also a gymnastics coach at the school, to train Davydova in her group. Yuri Shtukman, the administrator at the school, did not like this initiative by his new training staff and reprimanded the Korshunovs; however he allowed Davydova to stay in the school. It soon became apparent that she was a talented gymnast and Gennadiy took over her coaching himself. By 1972 Davydova was the best in her age group at the school.

Davydova has a brother, Yuri, who is 12 years her junior.

==Gymnastics career==
In 1973, Davydova won her first international tournament. In 1974 she became a member of the USSR junior squad. At the 1975 USSR Junior Championships Davydova finished 3rd AA and won golds on vault and bars. Following her success here she became a member of the senior squad. In March 1976 Davydova achieved second place all-around at the USSR championships, in her first try as a senior. She also won the gold on bars and a silver on floor. At the inaugural American Cup, Davydova performed a side somersault on the beam, the first woman ever to do so. However, she only received third place AA. At the USSR Cup Davydova tied for sixth place AA – and won bronze on vault, only 0.025 behind world vault champion Olga Korbut – but only the top five and one gymnast in ninth place were chosen for the Soviet Olympic team.

In August, Davydova won the Antibes tournament in France. In addition, she won gold on the vault, and silvers on beam, bars, and floor. At the Riga International she scored the highest per-routine score in the competition (9.75 on vault), and won silver in the AA competition. She dominated event finals, winning three gold (beam, vault, bars) and a bronze on floor. In October, she was made a member of the USSR gymnastics display team, which visited the UK. She subsequently performed her beam routine on the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; show.

In December 1976, Davydova finished third AA at the Chunichi Cup in Japan, and won a gold on vault and a bronze on floor at the Tokyo Cup. She was the only woman in the competition to perform a front somersault vault. She also tied for first AA with Kische and Kraker of East Germany. In 1977 Davydova again won the gold medal on bars at the USSR Cup, scoring a perfect 10.

In September 1977 Davydova appeared on the front cover of a new magazine with an emphasis on young gymnasts, entitled &quot;Gymnastics World&quot;. She was one of the four &quot;Mighty Mites&quot; featured in that issue. She was also a member of the USSR Display Team, along with Kim, Korbut, Grosdova, Filatova and Gorbik that performed in Great Britain.

Davydova suffered a serious injury when a bone detached itself from her knee. The injury could have been a career-ender, but she recovered.

In 1978, Gennady Korshunov and his wife were invited to coach gymnastics in Leningrad. Davydova and her family moved along with the Korshunov family. She achieved a silver AA at the Spartakiade of Russian Federation Sports Schools meet, and bronze AA at the USSR Cup, being the top scorer on both beam and bars. Shortly after, Davydova won the AA title at the prestigious Chunichi Cup in Japan defeating Maxi Gnauck. Her win by 0.55 points remains the joint third-highest margin of victory in the competition&#x27;s 34-year history. She also won gold on the bars and vault at the Tokyo Cup. As a result, she was chosen to be a member of the USSR team at the World Championships at Strasbourg in France. However, on the day of competition she was named as an alternate, and unable to compete.

At the 1979 Coca-Cola International in England, Davydova won a gold on floor and but lost gold on bars, after her coach blocked the line of vision of one of the judges, and she suffered the mandatory 0.3 deduction. She finished second AA at the Simo Sappien memorial tournament in Finland. Davydova was unable to attend the 1979 World Championships in Fort Worth, U.S., because of influenza. At the World University Games in Mexico she won team gold, bronze AA, and a silver medal on floor and bronze on vault.

In 1979 Olga Korbut named Davydova, Stella Zakharova, and Natalia Shaposhnikova as the three most promising young gymnasts.

===1980 Olympic Games===
At the 1980 &quot;Moscow News&quot; Tournament Davydova performed a full-on, full off vault. that had had only ever been done before by Olga Korbut. Davydova won a gold and 3 silver at the Moscow News Tournament. At the 1980 USSR Championships in April in Kiev Davydova won gold on vault- unveiling her unique vault full twist on, front somi off, scoring a 10 – and finished 3rd AA.

The Soviet Olympic gymnastics team was to be chosen after the USSR Cup competition. Davydova had finished joint 6th at the 1976 USSR Cup but that turned out to be insufficient to be placed on the team. Davydova won the all-around and scored a 10 on floor. Davydova subsequently was named to the Olympic team.

At the Olympics Davydova qualified for the all-around, vault and beam finals. The Soviet team won team gold and Davydova went on to win the all-around gold medal, and silver on the balance beam.

===Post-Olympics===
On 3 July 1981 in Montreux, the 100th anniversary celebration of the International Gymnastics Federation took place. Davydova was invited to perform her floor exercise. In August Davydova won the tournament in Giresum, Turkey. She won the AA title and was top scorer on vault, bars, floor and joint top scorer on beam. She scored 10&#x27;s on bars and floor.

At the 1981 USSR Championships, Davydova won the All-Around title plus golds on floor and vault and bronze on bars. She also participated in the 1981 World Championships, her last major international event. The USSR won team gold. Davydova suffered a serious neck injury in pre-competition warm up but still finished 3rd all-around with a fall and was the only gymnast from any nation to make all 4 event finals. She won silver on floor and bronze on bars.

Davydova remained on the Soviet display team until 1984 but retired from competitive gymnastics in late 1982. She was competing on vault at the Rome gymnastics Grand Prix in 82 when she injured her ankle. She didn&#x27;t want to finish Elite competition gymnastics and talked of defending her Olympic title in L.A. but it became obvious as time went on that her body could no longer stand the pounding of intense workouts.

==After retirement==
Davydova attended the &quot;Leningrad University of Physical education&quot; and later received her doctorate in Pedagogical science at the &quot;P.F. Lesgraft State Institute of Athletic Education&quot;. The title of her thesis was &quot;Nontraditional preparation of top gymnasts for competitions.&quot;

Davydova was part of the Saint Petersburg delegation that had bidden unsuccessfully to host the 2004 Olympic Games.

On 11 May 2007 Davydova was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame (IGHOF).

===Coaching career===
Upon graduation in 1987, Davydova began coaching and served as an international Brevet judge. She began her coaching career with the Leningrad Olympic reserve college and was a coach with the Soviet national gymnastics team.

Davydova now owns Gemini Gymnastics, a high performance gymnastics club in Oshawa, Ontario where she has been a coach since immigrating to Canada, and Head Coach since 1999. Some of her better known gymnasts include Stephanie Capucitti, Sarah Deegan, Danielle Hicks, Katherine Fairhurst, Kristina Vaculik, Brittnee Habbib, Kelsey Hope and Ava Stewart. She was beam coach for the Canadian women&#x27;s team at the 1995 World Championships and one of the Canadian women&#x27;s team coaches at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Davydova was twice named Gymnastics Canada Gymnastique coach of the year.
In October 2005 Davydova was chosen for the Coaching Association of Canada&#x27;s Women in Coaching National Team Coaching Apprenticeship Program.

In 2005, 2006 and 2010 Gymnastics Canada Gymnastique awarded Davydova and long-time associate coach, Valery Yahchybekov, as the &quot;Junior High Performance Coaches of the Year&quot;. Gemini Gymnastics has been recognised by GCG as Club of Excellence for 10 consecutive years since the inception of the awards in 2001. In 2006 Gemini received the prestigious Gymnastics Canada Ed Broughan award for &quot;Club of the Year&quot;. As of 2012 Gemini have produced 15 Canadian AA champions,8 Elite Canada AA champions, 21 Eastern Canada AA champions, 98 Ontario provincial AA champions plus gymnasts who have won a host of other medals and awards. In 2012 Gemini was awarded a Club of Excellence award, 1 of only 4 recognised across Canada, and 1 of 2 to earn the highest gold level honour. In April 2012 Davydova was named Ontario&#x27;s Coach of the Year.

In 2012, Kristina Vaculik, who was coached by Elena and Valery Yahchybekov at Gemini Gymnastics, was named to the Canadian Olympic team for the London 2012 Summer Olympic Games.

Davydova coached Canadian gymnast Ava Stewart at the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo.

===Gymnastics Judge===
Davydova became a gymnastics judge in 2005 and is the only Olympic all-around champion to do so.

In August, 2016, Davydova represented Canada as a judge at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Women&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics. She was named as head judge for the women&#x27;s floor events at the Olympics.

==Legacy==
Davydova advanced the difficulty of gymnastics, and is one of a select few to have introduced a new move and/or trend on each piece of apparatus. Davydova was the first female gymnast to perform an Arabian 1¾ somersault, and a piked Arabian 1¾ somersault on floor (both Arabian 1¾ moves removed from the code of points for female gymnasts by the FIG in 1993 for safety reasons, effectively banned because of their danger and difficulty.

===Eponymous skills===
Davydova has two eponymous skills listed in the Code of Points.

==Competitive History==
==Personal life==
Davydova married boxing coach Pavel Filatov on 1 June 1983. They have two sons, Dmitrii (born 21 February 1985) and Anton (28 June 1995). The family moved to Canada in 1991.

<text>Dermatology is the branch of medicine dealing with the skin. It is a speciality with both medical and surgical aspects. A dermatologist is a specialist medical doctor who manages diseases related to skin, hair, nails, and some cosmetic problems.

==Etymology==
Attested in English in 1819, the word &quot;dermatology&quot; derives from the Greek δέρματος (&quot;dermatos&quot;), genitive of δέρμα (&quot;derma&quot;), &quot;skin&quot; (itself from δέρω &quot;dero&quot;, &quot;to flay&quot;) and -λογία &quot;&quot;. Neo-Latin &quot;dermatologia&quot; was coined in 1630, an anatomical term with various French and German uses attested from the 1730s.

== History ==

In 1708, the first great school of dermatology became a reality at the famous Hôpital Saint-Louis in Paris, and the first textbooks (Willan&#x27;s, 1798–1808) and atlases (Alibert&#x27;s, 1806–1816) appeared in print around the same time.

== Training ==

===United States===
After earning a medical degree (M.D. or D.O.), the length of training in the United States for a general dermatologist to be eligible for board certification by the American Academy of Dermatology, American Board of Dermatology, or American Osteopathic Board of Dermatology is four years. This training consists of an initial medical, transitional, surgical, or pediatric intern year followed by a three-year dermatology residency. Following this training, one- or two-year post-residency fellowships are available in immunodermatology, phototherapy, laser medicine, Mohs micrographic surgery, cosmetic surgery, dermatopathology, or pediatric dermatology. While these dermatology fellowships offer additional subspecialty training, many dermatologists proficiently provide these services without subspecialty fellowship training. For the past several years, dermatology residency positions in the United States have been one of the most competitive to obtain.

According to the American Academy of Dermatology, dermatologists are trained to diagnose and manage over 3,000 distinct skin, hair, and nail conditions across patients spanning various age groups.

The United States has been experiencing a national shortage of dermatologists for more than a decade. A study published by the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; reported fewer than 3.4 dermatologists for every 100,000 people.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, a dermatologist is a medically qualified practitioner who has gone on to specialize in medicine and then subspecialize in dermatology. This involves:
* Medical school for five years to obtain an MBBS, MBBCh, MB, or BChir degree
* Two years of foundation rotations in various specialties
* Two to three years training in general medicine to obtain a higher degree in medicine and become a member of the Royal College of Physicians
* Having obtained the MRCP examination, applying to become a Specialty Registrar (StR) in Dermatology and training for four years in dermatology
* Passing the Specialty Certificate Examination in dermatology before the end of training

Upon successful completion of the four-year training period, the doctor becomes an accredited dermatologist and is able to apply for a consultant hospital post as a consultant dermatologist.

== Fields ==

=== Cosmetic dermatology ===

Dermatologists have been leaders in the field of cosmetic surgery. Some dermatologists complete fellowships in surgical dermatology. Many are trained in their residency on the use of botulinum toxin, fillers, and laser surgery. Some dermatologists perform cosmetic procedures including liposuction, blepharoplasty, and face lifts. Most dermatologists limit their cosmetic practice to minimally invasive procedures. Despite an absence of formal guidelines from the American Board of Dermatology, many cosmetic fellowships are offered in both surgery and laser medicine.

=== Dermatopathology ===

A dermatopathologist is a pathologist or dermatologist who specializes in the pathology of the skin. This field is shared by dermatologists and pathologists. Usually, a dermatologist or pathologist completes one year of dermatopathology fellowship and according to market projections, it is estimated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4% from 2022 to 2030. This usually includes six months of general pathology and six months of dermatopathology. Alumni of both specialties can qualify as dermatopathologists. At the completion of a standard residency in dermatology, many dermatologists are also competent at dermatopathology. Some dermatopathologists qualify to sit for their examinations by completing a residency in dermatology and one in pathology.

=== Trichology ===

Trichology specializes in diseases, which manifest with hair loss, hair abnormalities, hypertrichosis and scalp changes. Trichoscopy is a medical diagnostic method that is used by dermatologists with a special interest in trichology.

=== Immunodermatology ===

This field specializes in the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases such as lupus, bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and other immune-mediated skin disorders. Specialists in this field often run their own immunopathology labs. Immunodermatology testing is essential for the correct diagnosis and treatment of many diseases affecting epithelial organs including skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. The various diseases often overlap in clinical and histological presentation and, although the diseases themselves are not common, may present with features of common skin disorders such as urticaria, eczema and chronic itch. Therefore, the diagnosis of an immunodermatological disease is often delayed. Tests are performed on blood and tissues that are sent to various laboratories from medical facilities and referring physicians across the United States.

===Mohs surgery===

The dermatologic subspecialty called Mohs surgery focuses on the excision of skin cancers using a technique that allows intraoperative assessment of most of the peripheral and deep tumor margins. Developed in the 1930s by Frederic E. Mohs, the procedure is defined as a type of CCPDMA processing. Physicians trained in this technique must be comfortable with both pathology and surgery, and dermatologists receive extensive training in both during their residency. Physicians who perform Mohs surgery can receive training in this specialized technique during their dermatology residency, but many seek additional training either through formal preceptorships to become fellows of the American Society for Mohs Surgery or through one-year Mohs surgery fellowship training programs administered by the American College of Mohs Surgery. In 2020, the American Board of Dermatology (ABD) received approval from the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) to establish a board-certification exam in the subspecialty of Micrographic Dermatologic Surgery (Mohs Surgery). The exam was first offered in October 2021 to any US board-certified dermatologist who practices Mohs surgery, regardless of whether they received their training in dermatology residency or as part of a fellowship.

This technique requires the integration of the same doctor in two different capacities - surgeon and pathologist. In case either of the two responsibilities is assigned to another doctor or qualified health-care professional, it is not considered to be Mohs surgery.

=== Pediatric dermatology ===
Physicians can qualify for this specialization by completing both a pediatric residency and a dermatology residency. Or they might elect to complete a post-residency fellowship. This field encompasses the complex diseases of the neonates, hereditary skin diseases or genodermatoses, and the many difficulties of working with the pediatric population. Another area pediatric dermatologists may focus on is treating acne. Acne is formed when follicles under the skin become clogged. This can be caused by sebum, an oil that keeps the skin moist, or dead skin cells clogging the pores. This is very common in teens and young adults, and can be treated by prescription from a dermatologist. 

=== Teledermatology ===

Teledermatology is a form of dermatological practice in which telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information and treatment through audio, visual, and data communication, including photos of dermatologic conditions, between dermatologists and nondermatologists who are evaluating patients, along with dermatologists directly with patients via distance. In India, during the severe coronavirus situations, some dermatologists have initiated online consultation with their patients using some of popular apps, such as Practo, Apollo Pharmacy, Skin Beauty Pal, Lybrate, etc. This subspecialty deals with options to view skin conditions over a large distance to provide knowledge exchange, to establish second-opinion services for experts, or to use this for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions. Teledermatology can reduce wait times by allowing dermatologists to treat minor conditions online while serious conditions requiring immediate care are given priority for appointments.

===Dermatoepidemiology===

Dermatoepidemiology is the study of skin disease at the population level. One of its aspects is the determination of the global burden of skin diseases.
From 1990 to 2013, skin disease constituted about 2% of total global disease disability as measured in disability-adjusted life-years.

===Comparative Dermatology===

Comparative dermatology is a branch of dermatology that examines skin disorders across species, focusing on similarities and differences between humans and animals, such as dogs. This interdisciplinary approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of dermatological conditions and developing more effective treatment and prevention strategies.

Skin disorders are common in dogs, significantly affecting their quality of life and often requiring veterinary intervention. While some breeds are genetically predisposed to specific skin issues, there remains a notable gap in research comparing these canine conditions to similar human skin disorders. Addressing this gap can yield insights into the shared mechanisms underlying these diseases. For instance, atopic dermatitis. It is a common, itchy, and often difficult-to-treat condition. The Merck Veterinary Manual highlights various congenital and inherited skin disorders in dogs that are influenced by these factors, emphasizing the need for comparative research to improve disease management across species. By comparing the disease in animals and humans, researchers can gain insights into its progression and variability in response to treatments. 

Furthermore, research into the genetic underpinnings of skin disorders has demonstrated that certain genetic mutations in dogs are associated with inherited skin diseases, which may serve as models for understanding similar human conditions. Environmental factors, such as allergens and pollutants, also play a significant role in skin health. Studies published in journals focusing on inflammatory skin conditions in humans and veterinary research reveal how these environmental influences intersect with genetic predispositions, offering a comparative framework for further study.

Treatment strategies for skin disorders also differ between veterinary and human medicine. Veterinary treatments often prioritize symptomatic relief and prevention, while human dermatological care may involve a broader range of targeted pharmaceutical options. Comparative analysis of these treatment methodologies could lead to the development of new therapies beneficial to both fields, as discussed in microbiological research into skin health.

By emphasizing the comparative aspects of dermatology, researchers can contribute to a deeper understanding of skin health across species. This field underscores the importance of genetic research, environmental studies, and treatment innovations, as evidenced by ongoing research in dermatological and veterinary science.

== Therapies ==

Therapies provided by dermatologists include:
* Excision and treatment of skin cancer
* Cryosurgery for the treatment of warts, skin cancers, and other dermatoses
* Cosmetic filler injections
* Intralesional treatment with steroid drugs or chemotherapy
* Laser therapy for the management of birth marks, skin disorders (like vitiligo), tattoo removal, and cosmetic resurfacing and rejuvenation
* Chemical peels for the treatment of acne, melasma, and sun damage
* Photodynamic therapy for the treatment of skin cancer and precancerous growths
* Phototherapy including the use of narrowband UVB, broadband UVB, psoralen, and UVB
* Tumescent liposuction: Invented by a gynecologist, a dermatologist (Jeffrey A. Klein) adapted the procedure to local infusion of dilute anesthetic called tumescent liposuction. This method is now widely practiced by dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and gynecologists.
* Radiation therapy, although rarely practiced by dermatologists, some continue to provide it in their offices.
* Vitiligo surgery includes procedures such as autologous melanocyte transplant, suction blister grafting, and punch grafting.
* Allergy testing uses &quot;patch&quot; testing for contact dermatitis.
* Systemic therapies include antibiotics, immunomodulators, and novel injectable products.
* Topical therapies use many of the numerous products and compounds used topically.

Most dermatologic pharmacology can be categorized based on the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, specifically the ATC code D.

<text>In computer engineering, a hardware description language (HDL) is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, usually to design application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and to program field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

A hardware description language enables a precise, formal description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and simulation of the circuit. It also allows for the synthesis of an HDL description into a netlist (a specification of physical electronic components and how they are connected together), which can then be placed and routed to produce the set of masks used to create an integrated circuit.

A hardware description language looks much like a programming language such as C or ALGOL; it is a textual description consisting of expressions, statements and control structures. One important difference between most programming languages and HDLs is that HDLs explicitly include the notion of time.

HDLs form an integral part of electronic design automation (EDA) systems, especially for complex circuits, such as application-specific integrated circuits, microprocessors, and programmable logic devices.

==Motivation==
Due to the exploding complexity of digital electronic circuits since the 1970s (see Moore&#x27;s law), circuit designers needed digital logic descriptions to be performed at a high level without being tied to a specific electronic technology, such as ECL, TTL or CMOS. HDLs were created to implement register-transfer level abstraction, a model of the data flow and timing of a circuit.

There are two major hardware description languages: VHDL and Verilog. There are different types of description in them: &quot;dataflow, behavioral and structural&quot;.
Example of dataflow of VHDL:
LIBRARY IEEE;
USE IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

ENTITY not1 IS
 PORT(
 a : IN STD_LOGIC;
 b : OUT STD_LOGIC
END not1;

ARCHITECTURE behavioral OF not1 IS
BEGIN
 b &lt;= NOT a;
END behavioral;
==Structure of HDL==
HDLs are standard text-based expressions of the structure of electronic systems and their behaviour over time. Like concurrent programming languages, HDL syntax and semantics include explicit notations for expressing concurrency. However, in contrast to most software programming languages, HDLs also include an explicit notion of time, which is a primary attribute of hardware. Languages whose only characteristic is to express circuit connectivity between a hierarchy of blocks are properly classified as netlist languages used in electric computer-aided design. HDL can be used to express designs in structural, behavioral or register-transfer-level architectures for the same circuit functionality; in the latter two cases the synthesizer decides the architecture and logic gate layout.

HDLs are used to write executable specifications for hardware. A program designed to implement the underlying semantics of the language statements and simulate the progress of time provides the hardware designer with the ability to model a piece of hardware before it is created physically. It is this executability that gives HDLs the illusion of being programming languages, when they are more precisely classified as specification languages or modeling languages. Simulators capable of supporting discrete-event (digital) and continuous-time (analog) modeling exist, and HDLs targeted for each are available.

===Comparison with control-flow languages===
It is certainly possible to represent hardware semantics using traditional programming languages such as C++, which operate on control flow semantics as opposed to data flow, although to function as such, programs must be augmented with extensive and unwieldy class libraries. Generally, however, software programming languages do not include any capability for explicitly expressing time, and thus cannot function as hardware description languages. Before the introduction of System Verilog in 2002, C++ integration with a logic simulator was one of the few ways to use object-oriented programming in hardware verification. System Verilog is the first major HDL to offer object orientation and garbage collection.

Using the proper subset of hardware description language, a program called a synthesizer, or logic synthesis tool, can infer hardware logic operations from the language statements and produce an equivalent netlist of generic hardware primitives to implement the specified behaviour. Synthesizers generally ignore the expression of any timing constructs in the text. Digital logic synthesizers, for example, generally use clock edges as the way to time the circuit, ignoring any timing constructs. The ability to have a synthesizable subset of the language does not itself make a hardware description language.

== History ==

The first hardware description languages appeared in the late 1960s, looking like more traditional languages. The first that had a lasting effect was described in 1971 in C. Gordon Bell and Allen Newell&#x27;s text &quot;Computer Structures&quot;. This text introduced the concept of register transfer level, first used in the ISP language to describe the behavior of the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8.

The language became more widespread with the introduction of DEC&#x27;s PDP-16 RT-Level Modules (RTMs) and a book describing their use.
At least two implementations of the basic ISP language (ISPL and ISPS) followed.
ISPS was well suited to describe relations between the inputs and the outputs of the design and was quickly adopted by commercial teams at DEC, and by several research teams in the US and among its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

The RTM products never succeeded commercially and DEC stopped marketing them in the mid-1980s, as new methods grew more popular, more so very-large-scale integration (VLSI).

Separate work done about 1979 at the University of Kaiserslautern produced a language called KARL (&quot;KAiserslautern Register Transfer Language&quot;), which included design calculus language features supporting VLSI chip floorplanning and structured hardware design. This work was also the basis of KARL&#x27;s interactive graphic sister language ABL, whose name was an initialism for &quot;A Block diagram Language&quot;. ABL was implemented in the early 1980s by the Centro Studi e Laboratori Telecomunicazioni (CSELT) in Torino, Italy, producing the ABLED graphic VLSI design editor. In the mid-1980s, a VLSI design framework was implemented around KARL and ABL by an international consortium funded by the Commission of the European Union.

By the late 1970s, design using programmable logic devices (PLDs) became popular, although these designs were primarily limited to designing finite-state machines. The work at Data General in 1980 used these same devices to design the Data General Eclipse MV/8000, and commercial need began to grow for a language that could map well to them. By 1983 Data I/O introduced ABEL to fill that need.

In 1985, as design shifted to VLSI, Gateway Design Automation introduced Verilog, and Intermetrics released the first completed version of the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL). VHDL was developed at the behest of the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Program (VHSIC), and was based on the Ada programming language, and on the experience gained with the earlier development of ISPS. Initially, Verilog and VHDL were used to document and simulate circuit designs already captured and described in another form (such as schematic files). HDL simulation enabled engineers to work at a higher level of abstraction than simulation at the schematic level, and thus increased design capacity from hundreds of transistors to thousands. In 1986, with the support of the U.S Department of Defense, VHDL was sponsored as an IEEE standard (IEEE Std 1076), and the first IEEE-standardized version of VHDL, IEEE Std 1076-1987, was approved in December 1987. Cadence Design Systems later acquired Gateway Design Automation for the rights to Verilog-XL, the HDL simulator that would become the de facto standard of Verilog simulators for the next decade.

The introduction of logic synthesis for HDLs pushed HDLs from the background into the foreground of digital design. Synthesis tools compiled HDL source files (written in a constrained format called RTL) into a manufacturable netlist description in terms of gates and transistors. Writing synthesizable RTL files required practice and discipline on the part of the designer; compared to a traditional schematic layout, synthesized RTL netlists were almost always larger in area and slower in performance. A circuit design from a skilled engineer, using labor-intensive schematic-capture/hand-layout, would almost always outperform its logically-synthesized equivalent, but the productivity advantage held by synthesis soon displaced digital schematic capture to exactly those areas that were problematic for RTL synthesis: extremely high-speed, low-power, or asynchronous circuitry.

Within a few years, VHDL and Verilog emerged as the dominant HDLs in the electronics industry, while older and less capable HDLs gradually disappeared from use. However, VHDL and Verilog share many of the same limitations, such as being unsuitable for analog or mixed-signal circuit simulation. Specialized HDLs (such as Confluence) were introduced with the explicit goal of fixing specific limitations of Verilog and VHDL, though none were ever intended to replace them.

Over the years, much effort has been invested in improving HDLs. The latest iteration of Verilog, formally known as IEEE 1800-2005 SystemVerilog, introduces many new features (classes, random variables, and properties/assertions) to address the growing need for better test bench randomization, design hierarchy, and reuse. A future revision of VHDL is also in development, and is expected to match SystemVerilog&#x27;s improvements.

== Design using HDL ==

As a result of the efficiency gains realized using HDL, a majority of modern digital circuit design revolves around it. Most designs begin as a set of requirements or a high-level architectural diagram. Control and decision structures are often prototyped in flowchart applications, or entered in a editor. The process of writing the HDL description is highly dependent on the nature of the circuit and the designer&#x27;s preference for coding style. The HDL is merely the &#x27;capture language&#x27;, often beginning with a high-level algorithmic description such as a C++ mathematical model. Designers often use scripting languages such as Perl to automatically generate repetitive circuit structures in the HDL language. Special text editors offer features for automatic indentation, syntax-dependent coloration, and macro-based expansion of the entity/architecture/signal declaration.

The HDL code then undergoes a code review, or auditing. In preparation for synthesis, the HDL description is subject to an array of automated checkers. The checkers report deviations from standardized code guidelines, identify potential ambiguous code constructs before they can cause misinterpretation, and check for common logical coding errors, such as floating ports or shorted outputs. This process aids in resolving errors before the code is synthesized.

In industry parlance, HDL design generally ends at the synthesis stage. Once the synthesis tool has mapped the HDL description into a gate netlist, the netlist is passed off to the back-end stage. Depending on the physical technology (FPGA, ASIC gate array, ASIC standard cell), HDLs may or may not play a significant role in the back-end flow. In general, as the design flow progresses toward a physically realizable form, the design database becomes progressively more laden with technology-specific information, which cannot be stored in a generic HDL description. Finally, an integrated circuit is manufactured or programmed for use.

== Simulating and debugging HDL code ==

Essential to HDL design is the ability to simulate HDL programs. Simulation allows an HDL description of a design (called a model) to pass design verification, an important milestone that validates the design&#x27;s intended function (specification) against the code implementation in the HDL description. It also permits architectural exploration. The engineer can experiment with design choices by writing multiple variations of a base design, then comparing their behavior in simulation. Thus, simulation is critical for successful HDL design.

To simulate an HDL model, an engineer writes a top-level simulation environment (called a test bench). At minimum, a testbench contains an instantiation of the model (called the device under test or DUT), pin/signal declarations for the model&#x27;s I/O, and a clock waveform. The testbench code is event driven: the engineer writes HDL statements to implement the (testbench-generated) reset-signal, to model interface transactions (such as a host–bus read/write), and to monitor the DUT&#x27;s output. An HDL simulator — the program that executes the testbench — maintains the simulator clock, which is the master reference for all events in the testbench simulation. Events occur only at the instants dictated by the testbench HDL (such as a reset-toggle coded into the testbench), or in reaction (by the model) to stimulus and triggering events. Modern HDL simulators have full-featured graphical user interfaces, complete with a suite of debug tools. These allow the user to stop and restart the simulation at any time, insert simulator breakpoints (independent of the HDL code), and monitor or modify any element in the HDL model hierarchy. Modern simulators can also link the HDL environment to user-compiled libraries, through a defined PLI/VHPI interface. Linking is system-dependent (x86, SPARC etc. running Windows/Linux/Solaris), as the HDL simulator and user libraries are compiled and linked outside the HDL environment.

Design verification is often the most time-consuming portion of the design process, due to the disconnect between a device&#x27;s functional specification, the designer&#x27;s interpretation of the specification, and the imprecision of the HDL language. The majority of the initial test/debug cycle is conducted in the HDL &quot;simulator&quot; environment, as the early stage of the design is subject to frequent and major circuit changes. An HDL description can also be prototyped and tested in hardware — programmable logic devices are often used for this purpose. Hardware prototyping is comparatively more expensive than HDL simulation, but offers a real-world view of the design. Prototyping is the best way to check interfacing against other hardware devices and hardware prototypes. Even those running on slow FPGAs offer much shorter simulation times than pure HDL simulation.

== Design verification with HDLs ==

Historically, design verification was a laborious, repetitive loop of writing and running simulation test cases against the design under test. As chip designs have grown larger and more complex, the task of design verification has grown to the point where it now dominates the schedule of a design team. Looking for ways to improve design productivity, the electronic design automation industry developed the Property Specification Language.

In formal verification terms, a property is a factual statement about the expected or assumed behavior of another object. Ideally, for a given HDL description, a property or properties can be proven true or false using formal mathematical methods. In practical terms, many properties cannot be proven because they occupy an unbounded solution space. However, if provided a set of operating assumptions or constraints, a property checker can prove (or disprove) certain properties by narrowing the solution space.

The assertions do not model circuit activity, but capture and document the designer&#x27;s intent in the HDL code. In a simulation environment, the simulator evaluates all specified assertions, reporting the location and severity of any violations. In a synthesis environment, the synthesis tool usually operates with the policy of halting synthesis upon any violation. Assertion based verification is still in its infancy, but is expected to become an integral part of the HDL design toolset.

== HDL and programming languages ==

An HDL is grossly similar to a software programming language, but there are major differences. Most programming languages are inherently procedural (single-threaded), with limited syntactical and semantic support to handle concurrency. HDLs, on the other hand, resemble concurrent programming languages in their ability to model multiple parallel processes (such as flip-flops and adders) that automatically execute independently of one another. Any change to the process&#x27;s input automatically triggers an update in the simulator&#x27;s process stack.

Both programming languages and HDLs are processed by a compiler (often called a synthesizer in the HDL case), but with different goals. For HDLs, &quot;compiling&quot; refers to logic synthesis; the process of transforming the HDL code listing into a physically realizable gate netlist. The netlist output can take any of many forms: a &quot;simulation&quot; netlist with gate-delay information, a &quot;handoff&quot; netlist for post-synthesis placement and routing on a semiconductor die, or a generic industry-standard Electronic Design Interchange Format (EDIF) (for subsequent conversion to a JEDEC-format file).

On the other hand, a software compiler converts the source-code listing into a microprocessor-specific object code for execution on the target microprocessor. As HDLs and programming languages borrow concepts and features from each other, the boundary between them is becoming less distinct. However, pure HDLs are unsuitable for general purpose application software development, just as general-purpose programming languages are undesirable for modeling hardware.

Yet as electronic systems grow increasingly complex, and reconfigurable systems become increasingly common, there is growing desire in the industry for a single language that can perform some tasks of both hardware design and software programming. SystemC is an example of such—embedded system hardware can be modeled as non-detailed architectural blocks (black boxes with modeled signal inputs and output drivers). The target application is written in C or C++ and natively compiled for the host-development system; as opposed to targeting the embedded CPU, which requires host-simulation of the embedded CPU or an emulated CPU.

The high level of abstraction of SystemC models is well suited to early architecture exploration, as architectural modifications can be easily evaluated with little concern for signal-level implementation issues. However, the threading model used in SystemC relies on shared memory, causing the language not to handle parallel execution or low-level models well.

==High-level synthesis==

In their level of abstraction, HDLs have been compared to assembly languages. There are attempts to raise the abstraction level of hardware design in order to reduce the complexity of programming in HDLs, creating a sub-field called &quot;high-level synthesis&quot;.

Companies such as Cadence, Synopsys and Agility Design Solutions are promoting SystemC as a way to combine high-level languages with concurrency models to allow faster design cycles for FPGAs than is possible using traditional HDLs. Approaches based on standard C or C++ (with libraries or other extensions allowing parallel programming) are found in the Catapult C tools from Mentor Graphics, and the Impulse C tools from Impulse Accelerated Technologies.

A similar initiative from Intel is the use of Data Parallel C++, related to SYCL, as a high-level synthesis language.

Annapolis Micro Systems, Inc.&#x27;s CoreFire Design Suite and National Instruments LabVIEW FPGA provide a graphical dataflow approach to high-level design entry and languages such as SystemVerilog, SystemVHDL, and Handel-C seek to accomplish the same goal, but are aimed at making existing hardware engineers more productive, rather than making FPGAs more accessible to existing software engineers.

It is also possible to design hardware modules using MATLAB and Simulink using the MathWorks HDL Coder tool or DSP Builder for Intel FPGAs or Xilinx System Generator (XSG) from Xilinx.

== Examples of HDLs ==
=== HDLs for analog circuit design ===

=== HDLs for digital circuit design ===

The two most widely used and well-supported HDL varieties used in industry are Verilog and VHDL.

=== HDLs for printed circuit board design ===

Several projects exist for defining printed circuit board connectivity using language based, textual-entry methods. Among these, new approaches have emerged that focus on enhancing readability, reusability, and validation. These modern methodologies employ open-source design languages specifically tailored for electronics, adopting declarative markup to specify what circuits should achieve. This shift integrates software development principles into hardware design, streamlining the process and emphasizing automation, reuse, and validation.

<doc id="74555" wikidata="Q79928" url="?curid=74555" title="Acne">
<text>Acne ( ), also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin condition that occurs when dead skin cells and oil from the skin clog hair follicles. Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to lack of confidence, anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.

Susceptibility to acne is primarily genetic in 80% of cases. The roles of diet and cigarette smoking in the condition are unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight are associated with acne. In both sexes, hormones called androgens appear to be part of the underlying mechanism, by causing increased production of sebum. Another common factor is the excessive growth of the bacterium &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot;, which is present on the skin.

Treatments for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may minimize the condition. Treatments applied directly to the affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth for the treatment of acne. However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy. Several types of birth control pills help prevent acne in women. Medical professionals typically reserve isotretinoin pills for severe acne, due to greater potential side effects. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact on individuals.

In 2015, acne affected approximately 633million people globally, making it the eighth-most common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of teenagers in the Western world. Some rural societies report lower rates of acne than industrialized ones. Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty. Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties, and a smaller group continues to have difficulties in their forties.
==Classification==
The severity of acne vulgaris (Gr. ἀκμή, &quot;point&quot; + L. &quot;vulgaris&quot;, &quot;common&quot;) can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe to determine an appropriate treatment regimen. There is no universally accepted scale for grading acne severity. The presence of clogged skin follicles (known as comedones) limited to the face with occasional inflammatory lesions defines mild acne. Moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face, compared to mild cases of acne, and appear on the trunk of the body. Severe acne is said to occur when nodules (the painful &#x27;bumps&#x27; lying under the skin) are the characteristic facial lesions, and involvement of the trunk is extensive.

The lesions are usually, polymorphic, meaning they can take many forms, including open or closed comedones (commonly known as blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, and even nodules or cysts so that these lesions often leave behind sequelae, or abnormal conditions resulting from a previous disease, such as scarring or hyperpigmentation.

Large nodules were previously called cysts. The term &quot;nodulocystic&quot; has been used in the medical literature to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne. True cysts are rare in those with acne, and the term &quot;severe nodular acne&quot; is now the preferred terminology.

&quot;Acne inversa&quot; (L. invertō, &quot;upside-down&quot;) and &quot;acne rosacea&quot; (rosa, &quot;rose-colored&quot; + -āceus, &quot;forming&quot;) are not forms of acne and are alternate names that respectively refer to the skin conditions hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and rosacea. Although HS shares certain overlapping features with acne vulgaris, such as a tendency to clog skin follicles with skin cell debris, the condition otherwise lacks the hallmark features of acne and is therefore considered a distinct skin disorder.

==Signs and symptoms==

Typical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by the skin, microcomedones, comedones, papules, nodules (large papules), pustules, and often results in scarring. The appearance of acne varies with skin color. It may result in psychological and social problems.

===Scars===
Acne scars are caused by inflammation within the dermis and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. Abnormal healing and dermal inflammation create the scar. Scarring is most likely to take place with severe acne but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss at the site of the acne lesion.

Atrophic acne scars have lost collagen from the healing response and are the most common type of acne scar (accounting for approximately 75% of all acne scars). Ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars are subtypes of atrophic acne scars. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1.5–4 mm across. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2 mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Rolling scars are broader than ice-pick and boxcar scars (4–5 mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.

Hypertrophic scars are uncommon and are characterized by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on the trunk of the body.

===Pigmentation===
After an inflamed nodular acne lesion resolves, it is common for the skin to darken in that area, which is known as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). The inflammation stimulates specialized pigment-producing skin cells (known as melanocytes) to produce more melanin pigment, which leads to the skin&#x27;s darkened appearance. PIH occurs more frequently in people with darker skin color. Pigmented scar is a common term used for PIH, but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent. Often, PIH can be prevented by avoiding any aggravation of the nodule and can fade with time. However, untreated PIH can last for months, years, or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected. Even minimal skin exposure to the sun&#x27;s ultraviolet rays can sustain hyperpigmentation. Daily use of SPF 15 or higher sunscreen can minimize such a risk. Whitening agents like azelaic acid, arbutin or else may be used to improve hyperpigmentation.

== Causes ==
Risk factors for the development of acne, other than genetics, have not been conclusively identified. Possible secondary contributors include hormones, infections, diet, and stress. Studies investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive. Cleanliness (hygiene) and sunlight are not associated with acne.

===Genes===
Acne appears to be highly heritable; genetics explain 81% of the variation in the population. Studies performed in affected twins and first-degree relatives further demonstrate the strongly inherited nature of acne. Acne susceptibility is likely due to the influence of multiple genes, as the disease does not follow a classic (Mendelian) inheritance pattern. These gene candidates include certain variations in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1 alpha, and CYP1A1 genes, among others. The 308 G/A single nucleotide polymorphism variation in the gene for TNF is associated with an increased risk for acne. Acne can be a feature of rare genetic disorders such as Apert&#x27;s syndrome. Severe acne may be associated with XYY syndrome.

===Hormones===
Hormonal activity, such as occurs during menstrual cycles and puberty, may contribute to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. The androgen hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) are all linked to acne. High levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are also associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).

Medical conditions that commonly cause a high-androgen state, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are insensitive to the effects of androgens rarely have acne. Pregnancy can increase androgen levels, and consequently, oily sebum synthesis. Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or anabolic steroid use. Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements often contain illegally added anabolic steroids.

=== Infections ===
The anaerobic bacterial species &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; (formerly &quot;Propionibacterium acnes&quot;) contributes to the development of acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of &quot;C. acnes&quot; associated with normal skin and others with moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite &quot;Demodex&quot; is associated with the development of acne. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.

=== Diet ===
High-glycemic-load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity. Multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lower-glycemic-load diet to be effective in reducing acne. There is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne. Milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine IGF-1 and precursors of dihydrotestosterone. Studies suggest these components promote the effects of insulin and IGF-1 and thereby increase the production of androgen hormones, sebum, and promote the formation of comedones. Available evidence does not support a link between eating chocolate or salt and acne severity. Few studies have examined the relationship between obesity and acne. Vitamin B12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne (acneiform eruptions), or worsen existing acne when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake.

=== Stress ===
There are few high-quality studies to demonstrate that stress causes or worsens acne. Despite being controversial, some research indicates that increased acne severity is associated with high stress levels in certain contexts, such as hormonal changes seen in premenstrual syndrome.

=== Other ===
Some individuals experience severe intensification of their acne when they are exposed to hot humid climates; this is due to bacteria and fungus thriving in warm, moist environments. This climate-induced acne exacerbation has been termed tropical acne.
Mechanical obstruction of skin follicles with helmets or chinstraps can worsen pre-existing acne. However, acne caused by mechanical obstruction is technically not acne vulgaris, but another acneiform eruption known as acne mechanica.

Several medications can also worsen pre-existing acne; this condition is the acne medicamentosa form of acne. Examples of such medications include lithium, hydantoin, isoniazid, glucocorticoids, iodides, bromides, and testosterone. When acne medicamentosa is specifically caused by anabolic–androgenic steroids it can simply be referred to as steroid acne.

Genetically susceptible individuals can get acne breakouts as a result of polymorphous light eruption; a condition triggered by sunlight and artificial UV light exposure. This form of acne is called Acne aestivalis and is specifically caused by intense UVA light exposure. Affected individuals usually experience seasonal acne breakouts on their upper arms, shoulder girdle, back, and chest. The breakouts typically occur one-to-three days after exposure to intese UVA radiation. Unlike other forms of acne, the condition spares the face; this could possibly be a result of the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption, in which areas of the skin that are &quot;newly&quot; exposed to intense ultraviolet radiation are affected. Since faces are typically left uncovered at all stages of life, there is little-to-no likelihood for an eruption to appear there. Studies show that both polymorphous light eruption outbreaks and the acne aestivalis breakout response can be prevented by topical antioxidants combined with the application of a broad spectrum sunscreen.

==Pathophysiology==


Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease of the pilosebaceous unit and develops due to blockages in the skin&#x27;s hair follicles.

Traditionally seen as a disease of adolescence, acne vulgaris is also observed in adults, including post-menopausal women. Acne vulgaris manifested in adult female is called &quot;adult female acne&quot; (AFA), defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit. Particularly in AFA, during the menopausal transition, a relative increase in androgen levels occurs as estrogen levels begin to decline, so that this hormonal shift can manifest as acne; while most women with AFA exhibit few acne lesions and have normal androgen levels, baseline investigations, including an androgen testing panel, can help rule out associated comorbidities such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or tumors.

The blockages in the skin&#x27;s hair follicles that cause acne vulgaris manifestations occur as a result of the following four abnormal processes: increased oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; (&quot;C. acnes&quot;) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.

The earliest pathologic change is the formation of a plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In healthy skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. In people with acne, the increased production of oily sebum causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. The &quot;C. acnes&quot; biofilm within the hair follicle worsens this process. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).

The main hormonal driver of oily sebum production in the skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. The adrenal glands secrete higher amounts of DHEA-S during adrenarche (a stage of puberty), and this leads to an increase in sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium &quot;C. acnes&quot; readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. &quot;C. acnes&quot; triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is essential to comedo formation.

&quot;C. acnes&quot;&#x27; ability to bind and activate a class of immune system receptors known as toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4, is a core mechanism of acne-related skin inflammation. Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by &quot;C. acnes&quot; leads to increased secretion of IL-1α, IL-8, and TNF-α. The release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle, including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. IL-1α stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction, which, in turn, fuels comedo development. Furthermore, sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides, such as HBD1 and HBD2, in response to the binding of TLR2 and TLR4.

&quot;C. acnes&quot; also provokes skin inflammation by altering the fatty composition of oily sebum. Oxidation of the lipid squalene by &quot;C. acnes&quot; is of particular importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. Additionally, squalene oxidation increases 5-lipoxygenase enzyme activity, which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. PPARα increases the activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells. &quot;C. acnes&quot;&#x27; ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase further explains its inflammatory properties. These free fatty acids spur increased production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation.

This inflammatory cascade typically leads to the formation of inflammatory acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules. The involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade activates matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation.

Along with the bacteria &quot;C. acnes&quot;, the bacterial species &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; (&quot;S. epidermidis&quot;) also takes a part in the physiopathology of acne vulgaris. The proliferation of &quot;S. epidermidis&quot; with &quot;C. acnes&quot; causes the formation of biofilms, which blocks the hair follicles and pores, creating an environment under the skin. This enables for increased growth of both &quot;C. acnes&quot; and &quot;S. epidermidis&quot; under the skin. The proliferation of &quot;C. acnes&quot; causes the formation of biofilms and a biofilm matrix, making it even harder to treat the acne.

== Diagnosis ==
Acne vulgaris is diagnosed based on a medical professional&#x27;s clinical judgment. The evaluation of a person with suspected acne should include taking a detailed medical history about a family history of acne, a review of medications taken, signs or symptoms of excessive production of androgen hormones, cortisol, and growth hormone. Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must be present to diagnose acne. In their absence, an appearance similar to that of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not visible to the naked eye when inspecting the skin and require a microscope to be seen. Many features may indicate that a person&#x27;s acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman&#x27;s period; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.

Several scales exist to grade the severity of acne vulgaris, but disagreement persists about the ideal one for diagnostic use. Cook&#x27;s acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8, with higher numbers representing more severe acne. This scale was the first to use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale classifies the severity of the acne from grade 1 (least severe) to grade 4 (most severe).

===Differential diagnosis===
Many skin conditions can mimic acne vulgaris, and these are collectively known as acneiform eruptions. Such conditions include angiofibromas, epidermal cysts, flat warts, folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, milia, perioral dermatitis, and rosacea, among others. Age is one factor that may help distinguish between these disorders. Skin disorders such as perioral dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood. Rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults. Facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is also more suggestive of rosacea. The presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance. Chloracne and occupational acne due to exposure to certain chemicals &amp; industrial compounds, may look very similar to acne vulgaris.

==Management==
Many different treatments exist for acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide (niacinamide), retinoids, and salicylic acid. Acne treatments work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing &quot;C. acnes&quot;, and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Typical treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies, including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.

Recommended therapies for first-line use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such as light therapy and laser therapy are not first-line treatments and typically have only an add on role due to their high cost and limited evidence. Blue light therapy is of unclear benefit. Medications for acne target the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; acne generally improves between eight and twelve weeks after starting therapy.

People often view acne as a short-term condition, some expecting it to disappear after puberty. This misconception can lead to depending on self-management or problems with long-term adherence to treatment. Communicating the long-term nature of the condition and better access to reliable information about acne can help people know what to expect from treatments.

===Skin care===
In general, it is recommended that people with acne do not wash affected skin more than twice daily. The application of a fragrance-free moisturizer to sensitive and acne-prone skin may reduce irritation. Skin irritation from acne medications typically peaks at two weeks after onset of use and tends to improve with continued use. Dermatologists recommend using cosmetic products that specifically say non-comedogenic, oil-free, and will not clog pores.

Acne vulgaris patients, even those with oily skin, should moisturize in order to support the skin&#x27;s moisture barrier since skin barrier dysfunction may contribute to acne. Moisturizers, especially ceramide-containing moisturizers, as an adjunct therapy are particularly helpful for the dry skin and irritation that commonly results from topical acne treatment. Studies show that ceramide-containing moisturizers are important for optimal skin care; they enhance acne therapy adherence and complement existing acne therapies. In a study where acne patients used 1.2% clindamycin phosphate / 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel in the morning and applied a micronized 0.05% tretinoin gel in the evening the overwhelming majority of patients experienced no cutaneous adverse events throughout the study. It was concluded that using ceramide cleanser and ceramide moisturizing cream caused the favorable tolerability, did not interfere with the treatment efficacy, and improved adherence to the regimen. The importance of preserving the acidic mantle and its barrier functions is widely accepted in the scientific community. Thus, maintaining a pH in the range 4.5 – 5.5 is essential in order to keep the skin surface in its optimal, healthy conditions.

===Diet===
Causal relationship is rarely observed with diet/nutrition and dermatologic conditions. Rather, associations – some of them compelling – have been found between diet and outcomes including disease severity and the number of conditions experienced by a patient. Evidence is emerging in support of medical nutrition therapy as a way of reducing the severity and incidence of dermatologic diseases, including acne. Researchers observed a link between high glycemic index diets and acne. Dermatologists also recommend a diet low in simple sugars as a method of improving acne. As of 2014, the available evidence is insufficient to use milk restriction for this purpose.

===Medications===

====Benzoyl peroxide====
Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is a first-line treatment for mild and moderate acne due to its effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills &quot;C. acnes&quot; by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals likely interfere with the bacterium&#x27;s metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Combination products use benzoyl peroxide with a topical antibiotic or retinoid, such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively. Topical benzoyl peroxide is effective at treating acne.

Side effects include increased skin photosensitivity, dryness, redness, and occasional peeling. Sunscreen use is often advised during treatment, to prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are just as effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial antibiotic resistance.

====Retinoids====
Retinoids are medications that reduce inflammation, normalize the follicle cell life cycle, and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A. Studies show dermatologists and primary care doctors underprescribe them for acne. The retinoids appear to influence the cell life cycle in the follicle lining. This helps prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the hair follicle that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, especially for people with dark-colored skin. Retinoids are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Topical retinoids include adapalene, retinol, retinaldehyde, isotretinoin, tazarotene, trifarotene, and tretinoin. They often cause an initial flare-up of acne and facial flushing and can cause significant skin irritation. Generally speaking, retinoids increase the skin&#x27;s sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night. Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin, whereas adapalene is the least irritating but costs significantly more. Most formulations of tretinoin are incompatible for use with benzoyl peroxide. Tazarotene is the most effective and expensive topical retinoid but is usually not as well tolerated. In 2019 a tazarotene lotion formulation, marketed to be a less irritating option, was approved by the FDA. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects and is present in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.

Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid that is very effective for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months of use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6 month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single round of treatment, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of people require a second course, but 80% of those report improvement, resulting in a cumulative 96% efficacy rate.

There are concerns that isotretinoin is linked to adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, and anemia. There is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin has been found in some studies to be superior to antibiotics or placebo in reducing acne lesions. However, a 2018 review comparing inflammatory lesions after treatment with antibiotics or isotretinoin found no difference. The frequency of adverse events was about twice as high with isotretinoin use, although these were mostly dryness-related events. No increased risk of suicide or depression was conclusively found.

Medical authorities strictly regulate isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPLEDGE requires the woman to have two negative pregnancy tests and to use two types of birth control for at least one month before isotretinoin therapy begins and one month afterward. The effectiveness of the iPLEDGE program is controversial due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.

====Antibiotics====
People may apply antibiotics to the skin or take them orally to treat acne. They work by killing &quot;C. acnes&quot; and reducing inflammation. Although multiple guidelines call for healthcare providers to reduce the rates of prescribed oral antibiotics, many providers do not follow this guidance. Oral antibiotics remain the most commonly prescribed systemic therapy for acne. Widespread broad-spectrum antibiotic overuse for acne has led to higher rates of antibiotic-resistant &quot;C. acnes&quot; strains worldwide, especially to the commonly used tetracycline (e.g., doxycycline) and macrolide antibiotics (e.g., topical erythromycin). Therefore, dermatologists prefer antibiotics as part of combination therapy and not for use alone.

Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline or minocycline). Doxycycline 40 milligrams daily (low-dose) appears to have similar efficacy to 100 milligrams daily and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects. However, low-dose doxycycline is not FDA-approved for the treatment of acne. Antibiotics applied to the skin are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Oral antibiotics are generally more effective than topical antibiotics and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. The &quot;Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne&quot; recommends that topical and oral antibiotics are not used together.

Oral antibiotics are recommended for no longer than three months as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration are associated with the development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter durations. If long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are used, then it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid be used at the same time to limit the risk of &quot;C. acnes&quot; developing antibiotic resistance.

The antibiotic dapsone is effective against inflammatory acne when applied to the skin. It is generally not a first-line choice due to its higher cost and a lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is sometimes a preferred therapy in women or for people with sensitive or darker-toned skin. It is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to the risk of causing yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination. Minocycline is an effective acne treatment, but it is not a first-line antibiotic due to a lack of evidence that it is better than other treatments, and concerns about its safety compared to other tetracyclines.

Sarecycline is the most recent oral antibiotic developed specifically for the treatment of acne, and is FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory acne in patients nine years of age and older. It is a narrow-spectrum tetracycline antibiotic that exhibits the necessary antibacterial activity against pathogens related to acne vulgaris and a low propensity for inducing antibiotic resistance. In clinical trials, sarecycline demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing inflammatory acne lesions as early as three weeks and reduced truncal (back and chest) acne.

====Hormonal agents====
In women, the use of combined birth control pills can improve acne. These medications contain an estrogen and a progestin. They work by decreasing the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries and by decreasing the free and hence biologically active fractions of androgens, resulting in lowered skin production of sebum and consequently reduce acne severity. First-generation progestins such as norethindrone and norgestrel have androgenic properties and may worsen acne. Although oral estrogens decrease IGF-1 levels in some situations, which could theoretically improve acne symptoms, combined birth control pills do not appear to affect IGF-1 levels in fertile women. Cyproterone acetate-containing birth control pills seem to decrease total and free IGF-1 levels. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins, including desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, or norgestimate, as well as birth control pills containing cyproterone acetate or chlormadinone acetate, are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. Studies have shown a 40 to 70% reduction in acne lesions with combined birth control pills. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at reducing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance. In contrast to combined birth control pills, progestogen-only birth control forms that contain androgenic progestins have been associated with worsened acne.

Antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and spironolactone can successfully treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production, such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or scalp hair loss. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women. Unlike combined birth control pills, it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and is a useful acne treatment due to its ability to additionally block the androgen receptor at higher doses. Alone or in combination with a birth control pill, spironolactone has shown a 33 to 85% reduction in acne lesions in women. The effectiveness of spironolactone for acne appears to be dose-dependent. High-dose cyproterone acetate alone reportedly decreases acne symptoms in women by 75 to 90% within three months. It is usually combined with an estrogen to avoid menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency. The medication appears to be effective in the treatment of acne in males, with one study finding that a high dosage reduced inflammatory acne lesions by 73%. However, spironolactone and cyproterone acetate&#x27;s side effects in males, such as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and decreased bone mineral density, generally make their use for male acne impractical.

Pregnant and lactating women should not receive antiandrogens for their acne due to a possibility of birth disorders such as hypospadias and feminization of male babies. Women who are sexually active and who can or may become pregnant should use an effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy while taking an antiandrogen. Antiandrogens are often combined with birth control pills for this reason, which can result in additive efficacy. The FDA added a black-box warning to spironolactone about possible tumor risks based on preclinical research with very high doses (&gt;100-fold clinical doses) and cautioned that unnecessary use of the medication should be avoided. However, several large epidemiological studies subsequently found no greater risk of tumors in association with spironolactone in humans. Conversely, strong associations of cyproterone acetate with certain brain tumors have been discovered and its use has been restricted. The brain tumor risk with cyproterone acetate is due to its strong progestogenic actions and is not related to antiandrogenic activity nor shared by other antiandrogens.

Flutamide, a pure antagonist of the androgen receptor, is effective in treating acne in women. It appears to reduce acne symptoms by 80 to 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance. In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within three months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same period. In a large long-term study, 97% of women reported satisfaction with the control of their acne with flutamide. Although effective, flutamide has a risk of serious liver toxicity, and cases of death in women taking even low doses of the medication to treat androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions have occurred. As such, the use of flutamide for acne has become increasingly limited, and it has been argued that continued use of flutamide for such purposes is unethical. Bicalutamide, a pure androgen receptor antagonist with the same mechanism as flutamide and with comparable or superior antiandrogenic efficacy but with a far lower risk of liver toxicity, is an alternative option to flutamide in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women.

Clascoterone is a topical antiandrogen that has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of acne in both males and females and was approved for clinical use for this indication in August 2020. It has shown no systemic absorption or associated antiandrogenic side effects. In a small direct head-to-head comparison, clascoterone showed greater effectiveness than topical isotretinoin. 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride may be useful for the treatment of acne in both males and females but have not been adequately evaluated for this purpose. Moreover, 5α-reductase inhibitors have a strong potential for producing birth defects in male babies and this limits their use in women. However, 5α-reductase inhibitors are frequently used to treat excessive facial/body hair in women and can be combined with birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. There is no evidence as of 2010 to support the use of cimetidine or ketoconazole in the treatment of acne.

Hormonal treatments for acne such as combined birth control pills and antiandrogens may be considered first-line therapy for acne under many circumstances, including desired contraception, known or suspected hyperandrogenism, acne during adulthood, acne that flares premenstrually, and when symptoms of significant sebum production (seborrhea) are co-present. Hormone therapy is effective for acne both in women with hyperandrogenism and in women with normal androgen levels.

====Azelaic acid====

Azelaic acid is effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 15–20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide 5%, isotretinoin 0.05%, and erythromycin 2%. Azelaic acid is an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis. Therefore, it is useful in treating individuals with acne who are also affected by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids. Azelaic acid also led to worse treatment response when compared to benzoyl peroxide. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid makes little or no treatment response.

====Salicylic acid====
Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid that stops bacteria from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. It is less effective than retinoid therapy. Salicylic acid opens obstructed skin pores and promotes the shedding of epithelial skin cells. Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin can occur in individuals with darker skin types.

====Other medications====
Topical and oral preparations of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) are alternative medical treatments. Nicotinamide reportedly improves acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties (influencing neutrophil chemotaxis, inhibiting the release of histamine, suppressing the lymphocyte transformation test, and reducing nitric oxide synthase production induced by cytokines), its ability to suppress sebum production, and its wound healing properties. Topical and oral preparations of zinc are suggested treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. Zinc&#x27;s capacities to reduce inflammation and sebum production as well as inhibit &quot;C. acnes&quot; growth are its proposed mechanisms for improving acne. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.

Hydroquinone lightens the skin when applied topically by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine to the skin pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with the production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher in the morning with reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with the use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite, which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, the frequent and improper application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with a systemic condition known as exogenous ochronosis (skin discoloration and connective tissue damage from the accumulation of homogentisic acid).

====Combination therapy====
Combination therapy—using medications of different classes together, each with a different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated to be a more effective approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together is more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. Dermatologists generally prefer combining benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid. Both regimens are effective, but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.

===Pregnancy===
Although sebaceous gland activity in the skin increases during the late stages of pregnancy, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (pregnancy category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies&#x27; ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive (sealed) dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. The data examining the association between maternal topical retinoid exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes is limited. A systematic review of observational studies concluded that such exposure does not appear to increase the risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, stillbirths, premature births, or low birth weight. Similarly, in studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen in the second and third trimesters. Nevertheless, since rare harms from topical retinoids are not ruled out, they are not recommended for use during pregnancy due to persistent safety concerns. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X). Spironolactone is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its antiandrogen effects. Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic.

Topical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with the development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.

===Procedures===
Limited evidence supports comedo extraction, but it is an option for comedones that do not improve with standard treatment. Another procedure for immediate relief is the injection of a corticosteroid into an inflamed acne comedo. Electrocautery and electrofulguration are effective alternative treatments for comedones.

Light therapy is a treatment method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths of light to an area of skin affected by acne. Both regular and laser light have been used. The evidence for light therapy as a treatment for acne is weak and inconclusive. Various light therapies appear to provide a short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; it may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications. A 2016 meta-analysis was unable to conclude whether light therapies were more beneficial than placebo or no treatment, nor the duration of benefit.

When regular light is used immediately following the application of a sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinate, the treatment is referred to as photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapy modalities. PDT treats acne by using various forms of light (e.g., blue light or red light) that preferentially target the pilosebaceous unit. Once the light activates the sensitizing substance, this generates free radicals and reactive oxygen species in the skin, which purposefully damage the sebaceous glands and kill &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteria. Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response in the skin from the light) have been used to treat acne, including those that use infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO2 and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment is often referred to as laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. Ablative lasers are associated with higher rates of adverse effects compared with non-ablative lasers, with examples being post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum. Disadvantages of light therapy can include its cost, the need for multiple visits, the time required to complete the procedure(s), and pain associated with some of the treatment modalities. Typical side effects include skin peeling, temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Dermabrasion is an effective therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to their depth. The procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor with the introduction of laser resurfacing. Unlike dermabrasion, there is no evidence that microdermabrasion is an effective treatment for acne.

Dermal or subcutaneous fillers are substances injected into the skin to improve the appearance of acne scars. Fillers are used to increase natural collagen production in the skin and to increase skin volume and decrease the depth of acne scars. Examples of fillers used for this purpose include hyaluronic acid; poly(methyl methacrylate) microspheres with collagen; human and bovine collagen derivatives, and fat harvested from the person&#x27;s own body (autologous fat transfer).

Microneedling is a procedure in which an instrument with multiple rows of tiny needles is rolled over the skin to elicit a wound healing response and stimulate collagen production to reduce the appearance of atrophic acne scars in people with darker skin color. Notable adverse effects of microneedling include post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and tram track scarring (described as discrete slightly raised scars in a linear distribution similar to a tram track). The latter is thought to be primarily attributable to improper technique by the practitioner, including the use of excessive pressure or inappropriately large needles.

Subcision is useful for the treatment of superficial atrophic acne scars and involves the use of a small needle to loosen the fibrotic adhesions that result in the depressed appearance of the scar.

Chemical peels can be used to reduce the appearance of acne scars. Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner&#x27;s solution, or a lower concentration (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30–40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect the skin as deep as the papillary dermis. Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50% or more are considered to be deep chemical peels. Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.

===Alternative medicine===
Researchers are investigating complementary therapies as treatment for people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce the total number of skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil appears to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid but is associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil&#x27;s anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against &quot;C. acnes&quot; and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have demonstrated positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil; oligosaccharides from seaweed; however, few well-done studies have examined their use for this purpose. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.

===Self-care===
Many over-the-counter treatments in many forms are available, which are often known as cosmeceuticals. Certain types of makeup may be useful to mask acne. In those with oily skin, a water-based product is often preferred.

==Prognosis==
Acne usually improves around the age of 20 but may persist into adulthood. Permanent physical scarring may occur. Rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas, osteoma cutis, and acne with facial edema. Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to reduce the chances of these poor outcomes.

=== Mental health impact ===
There is good evidence to support the idea that acne and associated scarring negatively affect a person&#x27;s psychological state, worsen mood, lower self-esteem, and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders, depression, and suicidal thoughts.

Misperceptions about acne&#x27;s causative and aggravating factors are common, and people with acne often blame themselves, and others often blame those with acne for their condition. Such blame can worsen the affected person&#x27;s sense of self-esteem. Until the 20th century, even among dermatologists, the list of causes was believed to include excessive sexual thoughts and masturbation. Dermatology&#x27;s association with sexually transmitted infections, especially syphilis, contributed to the stigma.

Another psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excoriée, which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples, irrespective of the severity of their acne. This can lead to significant scarring, changes in the affected person&#x27;s skin pigmentation, and a cyclic worsening of the affected person&#x27;s anxiety about their appearance.

==Epidemiology==
Globally, acne affects approximately 650 million people, or about 9.4% of the population, as of 2010. It affects nearly 90% of people in Western societies during their teenage years, but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood. While acne that first develops between the ages of 21 and 25 is uncommon, it affects 54% of women and 40% of men older than 25 years of age and has a lifetime prevalence of 85%. About 20% of those affected have moderate or severe cases. It is slightly more common in females than males (9.8% versus 9.0%). In those over 40 years old, 1% of males and 5% of females still have problems.

Rates appear to be lower in rural societies. While some research has found it affects people of all ethnic groups, acne may not occur in the non-Westernized peoples of Papua New Guinea and Paraguay.

Acne affects 40–50 million people in the United States (16%) and approximately 3–5 million in Australia (23%). Severe acne tends to be more common in people of Caucasian or Amerindian descent than in people of African descent.

==History==
Historical records indicate that pharaohs had acne, which may be the earliest known reference to the disease. Sulfur&#x27;s usefulness as a topical remedy for acne dates back to at least the reign of Cleopatra (69–30 BCE). The sixth-century Greek physician Aëtius of Amida reportedly coined the term &quot; (,) or &quot;, which seems to be a reference to facial skin lesions that occur during &quot;the &#x27;&#x27; of life&quot; (puberty).

In the 16th century, the French physician and botanist François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix provided one of the earlier descriptions of acne. He used the term &quot;psydracia achne&quot; to describe small, red, and hard tubercles that altered a person&#x27;s facial appearance during adolescence and were neither itchy nor painful.

The recognition and characterization of acne progressed in 1776 when Josef Plenck (an Austrian physician) published a book that proposed the novel concept of classifying skin diseases by their elementary (initial) lesions. In 1808 the English dermatologist Robert Willan refined Plenck&#x27;s work by providing the first detailed descriptions of several skin disorders using morphologic terminology that remains in use today. Thomas Bateman continued and expanded on Robert Willan&#x27;s work as his student and provided the first descriptions and illustrations of acne accepted as accurate by modern dermatologists. Erasmus Wilson, in 1842, was the first to make the distinction between acne vulgaris and rosacea. The first professional medical monograph dedicated entirely to acne was written by Lucius Duncan Bulkley and published in New York in 1885.

Scientists initially hypothesized that acne represented a disease of the skin&#x27;s hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, they observed bacteria by microscopy in skin samples from people with acne. Investigators believed the bacteria caused comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) fully accounted for the disease in its entirety. This led to the current understanding that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.

The approach to acne treatment underwent significant changes during the twentieth century. Retinoids became a medical treatment for acne in 1943. Benzoyl peroxide was first proposed as a treatment in 1958 and remains a staple of acne treatment. The introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics (such as minocycline) modified acne treatment in the 1950s. These reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin plays an important role in causing acne. Subsequently, in the 1970s, tretinoin (original trade name Retin A) was found to be an effective treatment. The development of oral isotretinoin (sold as Accutane and Roaccutane) followed. After its introduction in the United States in 1982, scientists identified isotretinoin as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. In the United States, more than 2,000 women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between 1982 and 2003, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. Approximately 160 babies were born with birth defects due to maternal use of isotretinoin during pregnancy.

Treatment of acne with topical crushed dry ice, known as cryoslush, was first described in 1907 but is no longer performed commonly. Before 1960, the use of X-rays was also a common treatment.

==Society and culture==
The costs and social impact of acne are substantial. In the United States, acne vulgaris is responsible for more than 5 million doctor visits and costs over  billion each year in direct costs. Similarly, acne vulgaris is responsible for 3.5 million doctor visits each year in the United Kingdom. Sales for the top ten leading acne treatment brands in the US in 2015 amounted to $352million.

Acne vulgaris and its resultant scars are associated with significant social and academic difficulties that can last into adulthood. During the Great Depression, dermatologists discovered that young men with acne had difficulty obtaining jobs. Until the 1930s, many people viewed acne as a trivial problem among middle-class girls because, unlike smallpox and tuberculosis, no one died from it, and a feminine problem, because boys were much less likely to seek medical assistance for it. During World War II, some soldiers in tropical climates developed such severe and widespread tropical acne on their bodies that they were declared medically unfit for duty.

==Research==
Efforts to better understand the mechanisms of sebum production are underway. This research aims to develop medications that target and interfere with the hormones that are known to increase sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). Other sebum-lowering medications such as topical antiandrogens, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators, and inhibitors of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 enzyme are also a focus of research efforts. Particles that release nitric oxide into the skin to decrease skin inflammation caused by &quot;C. acnes&quot; and the immune system have shown promise for improving acne in early clinical trials. Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin&#x27;s hair follicles to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance.

The use of antimicrobial peptides against &quot;C. acnes&quot; is under investigation as a treatment for acne to overcoming antibiotic resistance. In 2007, scientists reported the first genome sequencing of a &quot;C. acnes&quot; bacteriophage (PA6). The authors proposed applying this research toward the development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment to overcome the problems associated with long-term antibiotic use, such as bacterial resistance. Oral and topical probiotics are under evaluation as treatments for acne. Probiotics may have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin&#x27;s ceramide content. As of 2014, knowledge of the effects of probiotics on acne in humans was limited.

Decreased levels of retinoic acid in the skin may contribute to comedo formation. Researchers are investigating methods to increase the skin&#x27;s production of retinoic acid to address this deficiency. A vaccine against inflammatory acne has shown promising results in mice and humans. Some have voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.

==Other animals==
Acne can occur on cats, dogs, and horses.

<doc id="74567" wikidata="Q189396" url="?curid=74567" title="Dynamic random-access memory">
<text>Dynamic random-access memory (dynamic RAM or DRAM) is a type of random-access semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a memory cell, usually consisting of a tiny capacitor and a transistor, both typically based on metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology. While most DRAM memory cell designs use a capacitor and transistor, some only use two transistors. In the designs where a capacitor is used, the capacitor can either be charged or discharged; these two states are taken to represent the two values of a bit, conventionally called 0 and 1. The electric charge on the capacitors gradually leaks away; without intervention the data on the capacitor would soon be lost. To prevent this, DRAM requires an external memory refresh circuit which periodically rewrites the data in the capacitors, restoring them to their original charge. This refresh process is the defining characteristic of dynamic random-access memory, in contrast to static random-access memory (SRAM) which does not require data to be refreshed. Unlike flash memory, DRAM is volatile memory (vs. non-volatile memory), since it loses its data quickly when power is removed. However, DRAM does exhibit limited data remanence.

DRAM typically takes the form of an integrated circuit chip, which can consist of dozens to billions of DRAM memory cells. DRAM chips are widely used in digital electronics where low-cost and high-capacity computer memory is required. One of the largest applications for DRAM is the &quot;main memory&quot; (colloquially called the RAM) in modern computers and graphics cards (where the main memory is called the &quot;graphics memory&quot;). It is also used in many portable devices and video game consoles. In contrast, SRAM, which is faster and more expensive than DRAM, is typically used where speed is of greater concern than cost and size, such as the cache memories in processors.

The need to refresh DRAM demands more complicated circuitry and timing than SRAM. This complexity is offset by the structural simplicity of DRAM memory cells: only one transistor and a capacitor are required per bit, compared to four or six transistors in SRAM. This allows DRAM to reach very high densities with a simultaneous reduction in cost per bit. Refreshing the data consumes power, causing a variety of techniques to be used to manage the overall power consumption. For this reason, DRAM usually needs to operate with a memory controller; the memory controller needs to know DRAM parameters, especially memory timings, to initialize DRAMs, which may be different depending on different DRAM manufacturers and part numbers.

DRAM had a 47% increase in the price-per-bit in 2017, the largest jump in 30 years since the 45% jump in 1988, while in recent years the price has been going down. In 2018, a &quot;key characteristic of the DRAM market is that there are currently only three major suppliers — Micron Technology, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics&quot; that are &quot;keeping a pretty tight rein on their capacity&quot;. There is also Kioxia (previously Toshiba Memory Corporation after 2017 spin-off) which doesn&#x27;t manufacture DRAM. Other manufacturers make and sell DIMMs (but not the DRAM chips in them), such as Kingston Technology, and some manufacturers that sell stacked DRAM (used e.g. in the fastest supercomputers on the exascale), separately such as Viking Technology. Others sell such integrated into other products, such as Fujitsu into its CPUs, AMD in GPUs, and Nvidia, with HBM2 in some of their GPU chips.

==History==

=== Precursors ===
The cryptanalytic machine code-named &quot;Aquarius&quot; used at Bletchley Park during World War II incorporated a hard-wired dynamic memory. Paper tape was read and the characters on it &quot;were remembered in a dynamic store.&quot; The store used a large bank of capacitors, which were either charged or not, a charged capacitor representing cross (1) and an uncharged capacitor dot (0). Since the charge gradually leaked away, a periodic pulse was applied to top up those still charged (hence the term &#x27;dynamic&#x27;)&quot;.

In November 1965, Toshiba introduced a bipolar dynamic RAM for its electronic calculator Toscal BC-1411. In 1966, Tomohisa Yoshimaru and Hiroshi Komikawa from Toshiba applied for a Japanese patent of a memory circuit composed of several transistors and a capacitor, in 1967 they applied for a patent in the US.

The earliest forms of DRAM mentioned above used bipolar transistors. While it offered improved performance over magnetic-core memory, bipolar DRAM could not compete with the lower price of the then-dominant magnetic-core memory. Capacitors had also been used for earlier memory schemes, such as the drum of the Atanasoff–Berry Computer, the Williams tube and the Selectron tube.

=== Single MOS DRAM ===
In 1966, Dr. Robert Dennard invented modern DRAM architecture in which there&#x27;s a single MOS transistor per capacitor, at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, while he was working on MOS memory and was trying to create an alternative to SRAM which required six MOS transistors for each bit of data. While examining the characteristics of MOS technology, he found it was capable of building capacitors, and that storing a charge or no charge on the MOS capacitor could represent the 1 and 0 of a bit, while the MOS transistor could control writing the charge to the capacitor. This led to his development of the single-transistor MOS DRAM memory cell. He filed a patent in 1967, and was granted U.S. patent number 3,387,286 in 1968. MOS memory offered higher performance, was cheaper, and consumed less power, than magnetic-core memory. The patent describes the invention: &quot;Each cell is formed, in one embodiment, using a single field-effect transistor and a single capacitor.&quot; 

MOS DRAM chips were commercialized in 1969 by Advanced Memory Systems, Inc of Sunnyvale, CA. This 1024 bit chip was sold to Honeywell, Raytheon, Wang Laboratories, and others.
The same year, Honeywell asked Intel to make a DRAM using a three-transistor cell that they had developed. This became the Intel 1102 in early 1970. However, the 1102 had many problems, prompting Intel to begin work on their own improved design, in secrecy to avoid conflict with Honeywell. This became the first commercially available DRAM, the Intel 1103, in October 1970, despite initial problems with low yield until the fifth revision of the masks. The 1103 was designed by Joel Karp and laid out by Pat Earhart. The masks were cut by Barbara Maness and Judy Garcia. MOS memory overtook magnetic-core memory as the dominant memory technology in the early 1970s.

The first DRAM with multiplexed row and column address lines was the Mostek MK4096 4 Kbit DRAM designed by Robert Proebsting and introduced in 1973. This addressing scheme uses the same address pins to receive the low half and the high half of the address of the memory cell being referenced, switching between the two halves on alternating bus cycles. This was a radical advance, effectively halving the number of address lines required, which enabled it to fit into packages with fewer pins, a cost advantage that grew with every jump in memory size. The MK4096 proved to be a very robust design for customer applications. At the 16 Kbit density, the cost advantage increased; the 16 Kbit Mostek MK4116 DRAM, introduced in 1976, achieved greater than 75% worldwide DRAM market share. However, as density increased to 64 Kbit in the early 1980s, Mostek and other US manufacturers were overtaken by Japanese DRAM manufacturers, which dominated the US and worldwide markets during the 1980s and 1990s.

Early in 1985, Gordon Moore decided to withdraw Intel from producing DRAM.
By 1986, many, but not all, United States chip makers had stopped making DRAMs. Micron Technology and Texas Instruments continued to produce them commercially, and IBM produced them for internal use. 

In 1985, when 64K DRAM memory chips were the most common memory chips used in computers, and when more than 60 percent of those chips were produced by Japanese companies, semiconductor makers in the United States accused Japanese companies of export dumping for the purpose of driving makers in the United States out of the commodity memory chip business. Prices for the 64K product plummeted to as low as 35 cents apiece from $3.50 within 18 months, with disastrous financial consequences for some U.S. firms. On 4 December 1985 the US Commerce Department&#x27;s International Trade Administration ruled in favor of the complaint.

Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) was developed by Samsung. The first commercial SDRAM chip was the Samsung KM48SL2000, which had a capacity of 16Mb, and was introduced in 1992. The first commercial DDR SDRAM (double data rate SDRAM) memory chip was Samsung&#x27;s 64Mb DDR SDRAM chip, released in 1998.

Later, in 2001, Japanese DRAM makers accused Korean DRAM manufacturers of dumping.

In 2002, US computer makers made claims of DRAM price fixing.

==Principles of operation==
DRAM is usually arranged in a rectangular array of charge storage cells consisting of one capacitor and transistor per data bit. The figure to the right shows a simple example with a four-by-four cell matrix. Some DRAM matrices are many thousands of cells in height and width.

The long horizontal lines connecting each row are known as word-lines. Each column of cells is composed of two bit-lines, each connected to every other storage cell in the column (the illustration to the right does not include this important detail). They are generally known as the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;−&quot; bit lines.

A sense amplifier is essentially a pair of cross-connected inverters between the bit-lines. The first inverter is connected with input from the + bit-line and output to the − bit-line. The second inverter&#x27;s input is from the − bit-line with output to the + bit-line. This results in positive feedback which stabilizes after one bit-line is fully at its highest voltage and the other bit-line is at the lowest possible voltage.

===Operations to read a data bit from a DRAM storage cell===
# The sense amplifiers are disconnected.
# The bit-lines are precharged to exactly equal voltages that are in between high and low logic levels (e.g., 0.5 V if the two levels are 0 and 1 V). The bit-lines are physically symmetrical to keep the capacitance equal, and therefore at this time their voltages are equal.
# The precharge circuit is switched off. Because the bit-lines are relatively long, they have enough capacitance to maintain the precharged voltage for a brief time. This is an example of dynamic logic.
# The desired row&#x27;s word-line is then driven high to connect a cell&#x27;s storage capacitor to its bit-line. This causes the transistor to conduct, transferring charge from the storage cell to the connected bit-line (if the stored value is 1) or from the connected bit-line to the storage cell (if the stored value is 0). Since the capacitance of the bit-line is typically much higher than the capacitance of the storage cell, the voltage on the bit-line increases very slightly if the storage cell&#x27;s capacitor is discharged and decreases very slightly if the storage cell is charged (e.g., 0.54 and 0.45 V in the two cases). As the other bit-line holds 0.50 V there is a small voltage difference between the two twisted bit-lines.
# The sense amplifiers are now connected to the bit-lines pairs. Positive feedback then occurs from the cross-connected inverters, thereby amplifying the small voltage difference between the odd and even row bit-lines of a particular column until one bit line is fully at the lowest voltage and the other is at the maximum high voltage. Once this has happened, the row is &quot;open&quot; (the desired cell data is available).
# All storage cells in the open row are sensed simultaneously, and the sense amplifier outputs latched. A column address then selects which latch bit to connect to the external data bus. Reads of different columns in the same row can be performed without a row opening delay because, for the open row, all data has already been sensed and latched.
# While reading of columns in an open row is occurring, current is flowing back up the bit-lines from the output of the sense amplifiers and recharging the storage cells. This reinforces (i.e. refreshes) the charge in the storage cell by increasing the voltage in the storage capacitor if it was charged to begin with, or by keeping it discharged if it was empty. Note that due to the length of the bit-lines there is a fairly long propagation delay for the charge to be transferred back to the cell&#x27;s capacitor. This takes significant time past the end of sense amplification, and thus overlaps with one or more column reads.
# When done with reading all the columns in the current open row, the word-line is switched off to disconnect the storage cell capacitors (the row is closed) from the bit-lines. The sense amplifier is switched off, and the bit-lines are precharged again.

===To write to memory===
To store data, a row is opened and a given column&#x27;s sense amplifier is temporarily forced to the desired high or low-voltage state, thus causing the bit-line to charge or discharge the cell storage capacitor to the desired value. Due to the sense amplifier&#x27;s positive feedback configuration, it will hold a bit-line at stable voltage even after the forcing voltage is removed. During a write to a particular cell, all the columns in a row are sensed simultaneously just as during reading, so although only a single column&#x27;s storage-cell capacitor charge is changed, the entire row is refreshed (written back in), as illustrated in the figure to the right.

===Refresh rate===

Typically, manufacturers specify that each row must be refreshed every 64 ms or less, as defined by the JEDEC standard.

Some systems refresh every row in a burst of activity involving all rows every 64 ms. Other systems refresh one row at a time staggered throughout the 64 ms interval. For example, a system with 213 = 8,192 rows would require a staggered refresh rate of one row every 7.8 μs which is 64 ms divided by 8,192 rows. A few real-time systems refresh a portion of memory at a time determined by an external timer function that governs the operation of the rest of a system, such as the vertical blanking interval that occurs every 10–20 ms in video equipment.

The row address of the row that will be refreshed next is maintained by external logic or a counter within the DRAM. A system that provides the row address (and the refresh command) does so to have greater control over when to refresh and which row to refresh. This is done to minimize conflicts with memory accesses, since such a system has both knowledge of the memory access patterns and the refresh requirements of the DRAM. When the row address is supplied by a counter within the DRAM, the system relinquishes control over which row is refreshed and only provides the refresh command. Some modern DRAMs are capable of self-refresh; no external logic is required to instruct the DRAM to refresh or to provide a row address.

Under some conditions, most of the data in DRAM can be recovered even if the DRAM has not been refreshed for several minutes.

===Memory timing===

Many parameters are required to fully describe the timing of DRAM operation. Here are some examples for two timing grades of asynchronous DRAM, from a data sheet published in 1998:
Thus, the generally quoted number is the /RAS low to valid data out time. This is the time to open a row, settle the sense amplifiers, and deliver the selected column data to the output. This is also the minimum /RAS low time, which includes the time for the amplified data to be delivered back to recharge the cells. The time to read additional bits from an open page is much less, defined by the /CAS to /CAS cycle time. The quoted number is the clearest way to compare between the performance of different DRAM memories, as it sets the slower limit regardless of the row length or page size. Bigger arrays forcibly result in larger bit line capacitance and longer propagation delays, which cause this time to increase as the sense amplifier settling time is dependent on both the capacitance as well as the propagation latency. This is countered in modern DRAM chips by instead integrating many more complete DRAM arrays within a single chip, to accommodate more capacity without becoming too slow.

When such a RAM is accessed by clocked logic, the times are generally rounded up to the nearest clock cycle. For example, when accessed by a 100 MHz state machine (i.e. a 10 ns clock), the 50 ns DRAM can perform the first read in five clock cycles, and additional reads within the same page every two clock cycles. This was generally described as timing, as bursts of four reads within a page were common.

When describing synchronous memory, timing is described by clock cycle counts separated by hyphens. These numbers represent in multiples of the DRAM clock cycle time. Note that this is half of the data transfer rate when double data rate signaling is used. JEDEC standard PC3200 timing is with a 200 MHz clock, while premium-priced high performance PC3200 DDR DRAM DIMM might be operated at timing.

Minimum random access time has improved from &quot;t&quot;RAC = 50 ns to , and even the premium 20 ns variety is only 2.5 times faster than the asynchronous DRAM. CAS latency has improved even less, from to 10 ns. However, the DDR3 memory does achieve 32 times higher bandwidth; due to internal pipelining and wide data paths, it can output two words every 1.25 ns , while the EDO DRAM can output one word per &quot;t&quot;PC = 20 ns (50 Mword/s).

====Timing abbreviations====
==Memory cell design==

Each bit of data in a DRAM is stored as a positive or negative electrical charge in a capacitive structure. The structure providing the capacitance, as well as the transistors that control access to it, is collectively referred to as a &quot;DRAM cell&quot;. They are the fundamental building block in DRAM arrays. Multiple DRAM memory cell variants exist, but the most commonly used variant in modern DRAMs is the one-transistor, one-capacitor (1T1C) cell. The transistor is used to admit current into the capacitor during writes, and to discharge the capacitor during reads. The access transistor is designed to maximize drive strength and minimize transistor-transistor leakage (Kenner, p. 34). 

The capacitor has two terminals, one of which is connected to its access transistor, and the other to either ground or VCC/2. In modern DRAMs, the latter case is more common, since it allows faster operation. In modern DRAMs, a voltage of +VCC/2 across the capacitor is required to store a logic one; and a voltage of −VCC/2 across the capacitor is required to store a logic zero. The resultant charge is formula_1, where &quot;Q&quot; is the charge in coulombs and &quot;C&quot; is the capacitance in farads.

Reading or writing a logic one requires the wordline be driven to a voltage greater than the sum of VCC and the access transistor&#x27;s threshold voltage (VTH). This voltage is called &quot;VCC pumped&quot; (VCCP). The time required to discharge a capacitor thus depends on what logic value is stored in the capacitor. A capacitor containing logic one begins to discharge when the voltage at the access transistor&#x27;s gate terminal is above VCCP. If the capacitor contains a logic zero, it begins to discharge when the gate terminal voltage is above VTH.

===Capacitor design===
Up until the mid-1980s, the capacitors in DRAM cells were co-planar with the access transistor (they were constructed on the surface of the substrate), thus they were referred to as &quot;planar&quot; capacitors. The drive to increase both density and, to a lesser extent, performance, required denser designs. This was strongly motivated by economics, a major consideration for DRAM devices, especially commodity DRAMs. The minimization of DRAM cell area can produce a denser device and lower the cost per bit of storage. Starting in the mid-1980s, the capacitor was moved above or below the silicon substrate in order to meet these objectives. DRAM cells featuring capacitors above the substrate are referred to as &quot;stacked&quot; or &quot;folded plate&quot; capacitors. Those with capacitors buried beneath the substrate surface are referred to as &quot;trench&quot; capacitors. In the 2000s, manufacturers were sharply divided by the type of capacitor used in their DRAMs and the relative cost and long-term scalability of both designs have been the subject of extensive debate. The majority of DRAMs, from major manufactures such as Hynix, Micron Technology, Samsung Electronics use the stacked capacitor structure, whereas smaller manufacturers such Nanya Technology use the trench capacitor structure (Jacob, pp. 355–357).

The capacitor in the stacked capacitor scheme is constructed above the surface of the substrate. The capacitor is constructed from an oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) dielectric sandwiched in between two layers of polysilicon plates (the top plate is shared by all DRAM cells in an IC), and its shape can be a rectangle, a cylinder, or some other more complex shape. There are two basic variations of the stacked capacitor, based on its location relative to the bitline—capacitor-under-bitline (CUB) and capacitor-over-bitline (COB). In the former, the capacitor is underneath the bitline, which is usually made of metal, and the bitline has a polysilicon contact that extends downwards to connect it to the access transistor&#x27;s source terminal. In the latter, the capacitor is constructed above the bitline, which is almost always made of polysilicon, but is otherwise identical to the COB variation. The advantage the COB variant possesses is the ease of fabricating the contact between the bitline and the access transistor&#x27;s source as it is physically close to the substrate surface. However, this requires the active area to be laid out at a 45-degree angle when viewed from above, which makes it difficult to ensure that the capacitor contact does not touch the bitline. CUB cells avoid this, but suffer from difficulties in inserting contacts in between bitlines, since the size of features this close to the surface are at or near the minimum feature size of the process technology (Kenner, pp. 33–42).

The trench capacitor is constructed by etching a deep hole into the silicon substrate. The substrate volume surrounding the hole is then heavily doped to produce a buried n+ plate with low resistance. A layer of oxide-nitride-oxide dielectric is grown or deposited, and finally the hole is filled by depositing doped polysilicon, which forms the top plate of the capacitor. The top of the capacitor is connected to the access transistor&#x27;s drain terminal via a polysilicon strap (Kenner, pp. 42–44). A trench capacitor&#x27;s depth-to-width ratio in DRAMs of the mid-2000s can exceed 50:1 (Jacob, p. 357).

Trench capacitors have numerous advantages. Since the capacitor is buried in the bulk of the substrate instead of lying on its surface, the area it occupies can be minimized to what is required to connect it to the access transistor&#x27;s drain terminal without decreasing the capacitor&#x27;s size, and thus capacitance (Jacob, pp. 356–357). Alternatively, the capacitance can be increased by etching a deeper hole without any increase to surface area (Kenner, p. 44). Another advantage of the trench capacitor is that its structure is under the layers of metal interconnect, allowing them to be more easily made planar, which enables it to be integrated in a logic-optimized process technology, which have many levels of interconnect above the substrate. The fact that the capacitor is under the logic means that it is constructed before the transistors are. This allows high-temperature processes to fabricate the capacitors, which would otherwise degrade the logic transistors and their performance. This makes trench capacitors suitable for constructing embedded DRAM (eDRAM) (Jacob, p. 357). Disadvantages of trench capacitors are difficulties in reliably constructing the capacitor&#x27;s structures within deep holes and in connecting the capacitor to the access transistor&#x27;s drain terminal (Kenner, p. 44).

===Historical cell designs===
First-generation DRAM ICs (those with capacities of 1 Kbit), such as the archetypical Intel 1103, used a three-transistor, one-capacitor (3T1C) DRAM cell with separate read and write circuitry. The write wordline drove a write transistor which connected the capacitor to the write bitline just as in the 1T1C cell, but there was a separate read wordline and read transistor which connected an amplifier transistor to the read bitline. By the second generation, the drive to reduce cost by fitting the same amount of bits in a smaller area led to the almost universal adoption of the 1T1C DRAM cell, although a couple of devices with 4 and 16 Kbit capacities continued to use the 3T1C cell for performance reasons (Kenner, p. 6). These performance advantages included, most significantly, the ability to read the state stored by the capacitor without discharging it, avoiding the need to write back what was read out (non-destructive read). A second performance advantage relates to the 3T1C cell&#x27;s separate transistors for reading and writing; the memory controller can exploit this feature to perform atomic read-modify-writes, where a value is read, modified, and then written back as a single, indivisible operation (Jacob, p. 459).

===Proposed cell designs===
The one-transistor, zero-capacitor (1T, or 1T0C) DRAM cell has been a topic of research since the late-1990s. &quot;1T DRAM&quot; is a different way of constructing the basic DRAM memory cell, distinct from the classic one-transistor/one-capacitor (1T/1C) DRAM cell, which is also sometimes referred to as &quot;1T DRAM&quot;, particularly in comparison to the 3T and 4T DRAM which it replaced in the 1970s.

In 1T DRAM cells, the bit of data is still stored in a capacitive region controlled by a transistor, but this capacitance is no longer provided by a separate capacitor. 1T DRAM is a &quot;capacitorless&quot; bit cell design that stores data using the parasitic body capacitance that is inherent to silicon on insulator (SOI) transistors. Considered a nuisance in logic design, this floating body effect can be used for data storage. This gives 1T DRAM cells the greatest density as well as allowing easier integration with high-performance logic circuits since they are constructed with the same SOI process technologies.

Refreshing of cells remains necessary, but unlike with 1T1C DRAM, reads in 1T DRAM are non-destructive; the stored charge causes a detectable shift in the threshold voltage of the transistor. Performance-wise, access times are significantly better than capacitor-based DRAMs, but slightly worse than SRAM. There are several types of 1T DRAMs: the commercialized Z-RAM from Innovative Silicon, the TTRAM from Renesas and the A-RAM from the UGR/CNRS consortium.

==Array structures==
DRAM cells are laid out in a regular rectangular, grid-like pattern to facilitate their control and access via wordlines and bitlines. The physical layout of the DRAM cells in an array is typically designed so that two adjacent DRAM cells in a column share a single bitline contact to reduce their area. DRAM cell area is given as &quot;n&quot;F2, where &quot;n&quot; is a number derived from the DRAM cell design, and &quot;F&quot; is the smallest feature size of a given process technology. This scheme permits comparison of DRAM size over different process technology generations, as DRAM cell area scales at linear or near-linear rates with respect to feature size. The typical area for modern DRAM cells varies between 6–8 F2.

The horizontal wire, the wordline, is connected to the gate terminal of every access transistor in its row. The vertical bitline is connected to the source terminal of the transistors in its column. The lengths of the wordlines and bitlines are limited. The wordline length is limited by the desired performance of the array, since propagation time of the signal that must transverse the wordline is determined by the RC time constant. The bitline length is limited by its capacitance (which increases with length), which must be kept within a range for proper sensing (as DRAMs operate by sensing the charge of the capacitor released onto the bitline). Bitline length is also limited by the amount of operating current the DRAM can draw and by how power can be dissipated, since these two characteristics are largely determined by the charging and discharging of the bitline.

===Bitline architecture===
Sense amplifiers are required to read the state contained in the DRAM cells. When the access transistor is activated, the electrical charge in the capacitor is shared with the bitline. The bitline&#x27;s capacitance is much greater than that of the capacitor (approximately ten times). Thus, the change in bitline voltage is minute. Sense amplifiers are required to resolve the voltage differential into the levels specified by the logic signaling system. Modern DRAMs use differential sense amplifiers, and are accompanied by requirements as to how the DRAM arrays are constructed. Differential sense amplifiers work by driving their outputs to opposing extremes based on the relative voltages on pairs of bitlines. The sense amplifiers function effectively and efficient only if the capacitance and voltages of these bitline pairs are closely matched. Besides ensuring that the lengths of the bitlines and the number of attached DRAM cells attached to them are equal, two basic architectures to array design have emerged to provide for the requirements of the sense amplifiers: open and folded bitline arrays.

====Open bitline arrays====
The first generation (1 Kbit) DRAM ICs, up until the 64 Kbit generation (and some 256 Kbit generation devices) had open bitline array architectures. In these architectures, the bitlines are divided into multiple segments, and the differential sense amplifiers are placed in between bitline segments. Because the sense amplifiers are placed between bitline segments, to route their outputs outside the array, an additional layer of interconnect placed above those used to construct the wordlines and bitlines is required.

The DRAM cells that are on the edges of the array do not have adjacent segments. Since the differential sense amplifiers require identical capacitance and bitline lengths from both segments, dummy bitline segments are provided. The advantage of the open bitline array is a smaller array area, although this advantage is slightly diminished by the dummy bitline segments. The disadvantage that caused the near disappearance of this architecture is the inherent vulnerability to noise, which affects the effectiveness of the differential sense amplifiers. Since each bitline segment does not have any spatial relationship to the other, it is likely that noise would affect only one of the two bitline segments.

====Folded bitline arrays====
The folded bitline array architecture routes bitlines in pairs throughout the array. The close proximity of the paired bitlines provide superior common-mode noise rejection characteristics over open bitline arrays. The folded bitline array architecture began appearing in DRAM ICs during the mid-1980s, beginning with the 256 Kbit generation. This architecture is favored in modern DRAM ICs for its superior noise immunity.

This architecture is referred to as &quot;folded&quot; because it takes its basis from the open array architecture from the perspective of the circuit schematic. The folded array architecture appears to remove DRAM cells in alternate pairs (because two DRAM cells share a single bitline contact) from a column, then move the DRAM cells from an adjacent column into the voids.

The location where the bitline twists occupies additional area. To minimize area overhead, engineers select the simplest and most area-minimal twisting scheme that is able to reduce noise under the specified limit. As process technology improves to reduce minimum feature sizes, the signal to noise problem worsens, since coupling between adjacent metal wires is inversely proportional to their pitch. The array folding and bitline twisting schemes that are used must increase in complexity in order to maintain sufficient noise reduction. Schemes that have desirable noise immunity characteristics for a minimal impact in area is the topic of current research (Kenner, p. 37).

====Future array architectures====
Advances in process technology could result in open bitline array architectures being favored if it is able to offer better long-term area efficiencies; since folded array architectures require increasingly complex folding schemes to match any advance in process technology. The relationship between process technology, array architecture, and area efficiency is an active area of research.

===Row and column redundancy===
The first DRAM integrated circuits did not have any redundancy. An integrated circuit with a defective DRAM cell would be discarded. Beginning with the 64 Kbit generation, DRAM arrays have included spare rows and columns to improve yields. Spare rows and columns provide tolerance of minor fabrication defects which have caused a small number of rows or columns to be inoperable. The defective rows and columns are physically disconnected from the rest of the array by a triggering a programmable fuse or by cutting the wire by a laser. The spare rows or columns are substituted in by remapping logic in the row and column decoders (Jacob, pp. 358–361).

==Error detection and correction==
Electrical or magnetic interference inside a computer system can cause a single bit of DRAM to spontaneously flip to the opposite state. The majority of one-off (&quot;soft&quot;) errors in DRAM chips occur as a result of background radiation, chiefly neutrons from cosmic ray secondaries, which may change the contents of one or more memory cells or interfere with the circuitry used to read/write them.

The problem can be mitigated by using redundant memory bits and additional circuitry that use these bits to detect and correct soft errors. In most cases, the detection and correction are performed by the memory controller; sometimes, the required logic is transparently implemented within DRAM chips or modules, enabling the ECC memory functionality for otherwise ECC-incapable systems. The extra memory bits are used to record parity and to enable missing data to be reconstructed by error-correcting code (ECC). Parity allows the detection of all single-bit errors (actually, any odd number of wrong bits). The most common error-correcting code, a SECDED Hamming code, allows a single-bit error to be corrected and, in the usual configuration, with an extra parity bit, double-bit errors to be detected.

Recent studies give widely varying error rates with over seven orders of magnitude difference, ranging from , roughly one bit error, per hour, per gigabyte of memory to one bit error, per century, per gigabyte of memory. The Schroeder et al. 2009 study reported a 32% chance that a given computer in their study would suffer from at least one correctable error per year, and provided evidence that most such errors are intermittent hard rather than soft errors and that trace amounts of radioactive material that had gotten into the chip packaging were emitting alpha particles and corrupting the data. A 2010 study at the University of Rochester also gave evidence that a substantial fraction of memory errors are intermittent hard errors. Large scale studies on non-ECC main memory in PCs and laptops suggest that undetected memory errors account for a substantial number of system failures: the 2011 study reported a 1-in-1700 chance per 1.5% of memory tested (extrapolating to an approximately 26% chance for total memory) that a computer would have a memory error every eight months.

==Security==

===Data remanence===
Although dynamic memory is only specified and &quot;guaranteed&quot; to retain its contents when supplied with power and refreshed every short period of time (often ), the memory cell capacitors often retain their values for significantly longer time, particularly at low temperatures. Under some conditions most of the data in DRAM can be recovered even if it has not been refreshed for several minutes.

This property can be used to circumvent security and recover data stored in the main memory that is assumed to be destroyed at power-down. The computer could be quickly rebooted, and the contents of the main memory read out; or by removing a computer&#x27;s memory modules, cooling them to prolong data remanence, then transferring them to a different computer to be read out. Such an attack was demonstrated to circumvent popular disk encryption systems, such as the open source TrueCrypt, Microsoft&#x27;s BitLocker Drive Encryption, and Apple&#x27;s FileVault. This type of attack against a computer is often called a cold boot attack.

===Memory corruption===
Dynamic memory, by definition, requires periodic refresh. Furthermore, reading 1T dynamic memory is a destructive operation, requiring a recharge of the storage cells in the row that has been read. If these processes are imperfect, a read operation can cause soft errors. In particular, there is a risk that some charge can leak between nearby cells, causing the refresh or read of one row to cause a &quot;disturbance error&quot; in an adjacent or even nearby row. The awareness of disturbance errors dates back to the first commercially available DRAM in the early 1970s (the Intel 1103). Despite the mitigation techniques employed by manufacturers, commercial researchers proved in a 2014 analysis that commercially available DDR3 DRAM chips manufactured in 2012 and 2013 are susceptible to disturbance errors. The associated side effect that led to observed bit flips has been dubbed &quot;row hammer&quot;.

==Packaging==
===Memory module===
Dynamic RAM ICs can be packaged in molded epoxy cases, with an internal lead frame for interconnections between the silicon die and the package leads. The original IBM PC design used ICs, including those for DRAM, packaged in dual in-line packages (DIP), soldered directly to the main board or mounted in sockets. As memory density skyrocketed, the DIP package was no longer practical. For convenience in handling, several dynamic RAM integrated circuits may be mounted on a single memory module, allowing installation of 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit wide memory in a single unit, without the requirement for the installer to insert multiple individual integrated circuits. Memory modules may include additional devices for parity checking or error correction. Over the evolution of desktop computers, several standardized types of memory module have been developed. Laptop computers, game consoles, and specialized devices may have their own formats of memory modules not interchangeable with standard desktop parts for packaging or proprietary reasons.

===Embedded===

DRAM that is integrated into an integrated circuit designed in a logic-optimized process (such as an application-specific integrated circuit, microprocessor, or an entire system on a chip) is called &quot;embedded DRAM&quot; (eDRAM). Embedded DRAM requires DRAM cell designs that can be fabricated without preventing the fabrication of fast-switching transistors used in high-performance logic, and modification of the basic logic-optimized process technology to accommodate the process steps required to build DRAM cell structures.

==Versions==
Since the fundamental DRAM cell and array has maintained the same basic structure for many years, the types of DRAM are mainly distinguished by the many different interfaces for communicating with DRAM chips.

===Asynchronous DRAM===
The original DRAM, now known by the retronym &quot;asynchronous DRAM&quot; was the first type of DRAM in use. From its origins in the late 1960s, it was commonplace in computing up until around 1997, when it was mostly replaced by &quot;synchronous DRAM&quot;. In the present day, manufacture of asynchronous RAM is relatively rare.

====Principles of operation====
An asynchronous DRAM chip has power connections, some number of address inputs (typically 12), and a few (typically one or four) bidirectional data lines. There are three main active-low control signals:
* , the Row Address Strobe. The address inputs are captured on the falling edge of , and select a row to open. The row is held open as long as is low.
* , the Column Address Strobe. The address inputs are captured on the falling edge of , and select a column from the currently open row to read or write.
* , Write Enable. This signal determines whether a given falling edge of is a read (if high) or write (if low). If low, the data inputs are also captured on the falling edge of . If high, the data outputs are enabled by the falling edge of and produce valid output after the internal access time.

This interface provides direct control of internal timing: when is driven low, a cycle must not be attempted until the sense amplifiers have sensed the memory state, and must not be returned high until the storage cells have been refreshed. When is driven high, it must be held high long enough for precharging to complete.

Although the DRAM is asynchronous, the signals are typically generated by a clocked memory controller, which limits their timing to multiples of the controller&#x27;s clock cycle.

For completeness, we mention two other control signals which are not essential to DRAM operation, but are provided for the convenience of systems using DRAM:
* , Chip Select. When this is high, all other inputs are ignored. This makes it easy to build an array of DRAM chips which share the same control signals. Just as DRAM internally uses the word lines to select one row of storage cells connect to the shared bit lines and sense amplifiers, is used to select one row of DRAM chips to connect to the shared control, address, and data lines.
* , Output Enable. This is an additional signal that (if high) inhibits output on the data I/‍O pins, while allowing all other operations to proceed normally. In many applications, can be permanently connected low (output enabled whenever , and are low and is high), but in high-speed applications, judicious use of can prevent bus contention between two DRAM chips connected to the same data lines. For example, it is possible to have two interleaved memory banks sharing the address and data lines, but each having their own , , and connections. The memory controller can begin a read from the second bank while a read from the first bank is in progress, using the two signals to only permit one result to appear on the data bus at a time.

=====RAS-only refresh=====
Classic asynchronous DRAM is refreshed by opening each row in turn.

The refresh cycles are distributed across the entire refresh interval in such a way that all rows are refreshed within the required interval. To refresh one row of the memory array using only refresh (ROR), the following steps must occur:
# The row address of the row to be refreshed must be applied at the address input pins.
# must switch from high to low. must remain high.
# At the end of the required amount of time, must return high.

This can be done by supplying a row address and pulsing low; it is not necessary to perform any cycles. An external counter is needed to iterate over the row addresses in turn. In some designs, the CPU handled RAM refresh. The Zilog Z80 is perhaps the best known example, as it has an internal row counter R which supplies the address for a special refresh cycle generated after each instruction fetch. In other systems, especially home computers, refresh was handled by the video circuitry as a side effect of its periodic scan of the frame buffer.

=====CAS before RAS refresh=====
For convenience, the counter was quickly incorporated into the DRAM chips themselves. If the line is driven low before (normally an illegal operation), then the DRAM ignores the address inputs and uses an internal counter to select the row to open. This is known as -before- (CBR) refresh. This became the standard form of refresh for asynchronous DRAM, and is the only form generally used with SDRAM.

=====Hidden refresh=====
Given support of -before- refresh, it is possible to deassert while holding low to maintain data output. If is then asserted again, this performs a CBR refresh cycle while the DRAM outputs remain valid. Because data output is not interrupted, this is known as &quot;hidden refresh&quot;. Hidden refresh is no faster than a normal read followed by a normal refresh, but does maintain the data output valid during the refresh cycle.

====Page mode DRAM====




Page mode DRAM is a minor modification to the first-generation DRAM IC interface which improves the performance of reads and writes to a row by avoiding the inefficiency of precharging and opening the same row repeatedly to access a different column. In page mode DRAM, after a row is opened by holding low, the row can be kept open, and multiple reads or writes can be performed to any of the columns in the row. Each column access is initiated by presenting a column address and asserting . For reads, after a delay (&quot;t&quot;CAC), valid data appears on the data out pins, which are held at high-Z before the appearance of valid data. For writes, the write enable signal and write data is presented along with the column address.

Page mode DRAM was in turn later improved with a small modification which further reduced latency. DRAMs with this improvement are called fast page mode DRAMs (FPM DRAMs). In page mode DRAM, the chip does not capture the column address until is asserted, so column access time (until data out was valid) begins when is asserted. In FPM DRAM, the column address can be supplied while is still deasserted, and the main column access time (&quot;t&quot;AA) begins as soon as the address is stable. The signal is only needed to enable the output (the data out pins were held at high-Z while was deasserted), so time from assertion to data valid (&quot;t&quot;CAC) is greatly reduced. Fast page mode DRAM was introduced in 1986 and was used with the Intel 80486.

&quot;Static column&quot; is a variant of fast page mode in which the column address does not need to be latched, but rather the address inputs may be changed with held low, and the data output will be updated accordingly a few nanoseconds later.

&quot;Nibble mode&quot; is another variant in which four sequential locations within the row can be accessed with four consecutive pulses of . The difference from normal page mode is that the address inputs are not used for the second through fourth edges but are generated internally starting with the address supplied for the first edge. The predictable addresses let the chip prepare the data internally and respond very quickly to the subsequent pulses.

====Extended data out DRAM====


Extended data out DRAM (EDO DRAM) was invented and patented in the 1990s by Micron Technology who then licensed technology to many other memory manufacturers. EDO RAM, sometimes referred to as &quot;hyper page mode&quot; enabled DRAM, is similar to fast page mode DRAM with the additional feature that a new access cycle can be started while keeping the data output of the previous cycle active. This allows a certain amount of overlap in operation (pipelining), allowing somewhat improved performance. It is up to 30% faster than FPM DRAM, which it began to replace in 1995 when Intel introduced the 430FX chipset with EDO DRAM support. Irrespective of the performance gains, FPM and EDO SIMMs can be used interchangeably in many (but not all) applications.

To be precise, EDO DRAM begins data output on the falling edge of but does not disable the output when rises again. Instead, it holds the current output valid (thus extending the data output time) even as the DRAM begins decoding a new column address, until either a new column&#x27;s data is selected by another falling edge, or the output is switched off by the rising edge of . (Or, less commonly, a change in , , or .)

This ability to start a new access even before the system has received the preceding column&#x27;s data made it possible to design memory controllers which could carry out a access (in the currently open row) in one clock cycle, or at least within two clock cycles instead of the previously required three. EDO&#x27;s capabilities were able to partially compensate for the performance lost due to the lack of an L2 cache in low-cost, commodity PCs. More expensive notebooks also often lacked an L2 cache die to size and power limitations, and benefitted similarly. Even for systems &quot;with&quot; an L2 cache, the availability of EDO memory improved the average memory latency seen by applications over earlier FPM implementations.

Single-cycle EDO DRAM became very popular on video cards toward the end of the 1990s. It was very low cost, yet nearly as efficient for performance as the far more costly VRAM.

====Burst EDO DRAM====
An evolution of EDO DRAM, burst EDO DRAM (BEDO DRAM), could process four memory addresses in one burst, for a maximum of , saving an additional three clocks over optimally designed EDO memory. It was done by adding an address counter on the chip to keep track of the next address. BEDO also added a pipeline stage allowing page-access cycle to be divided into two parts. During a memory-read operation, the first part accessed the data from the memory array to the output stage (second latch). The second part drove the data bus from this latch at the appropriate logic level. Since the data is already in the output buffer, quicker access time is achieved (up to 50% for large blocks of data) than with traditional EDO.

Although BEDO DRAM showed additional optimization over EDO, by the time it was available the market had made a significant investment towards synchronous DRAM, or SDRAM. Even though BEDO RAM was superior to SDRAM in some ways, the latter technology quickly displaced BEDO.

===Synchronous dynamic RAM===

Synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) significantly revises the asynchronous memory interface, adding a clock (and a clock enable) line. All other signals are received on the rising edge of the clock.

The and inputs no longer act as strobes, but are instead, along with , part of a 3-bit command:
The line&#x27;s function is extended to a per-byte DQM signal, which controls data input (writes) in addition to data output (reads). This allows DRAM chips to be wider than 8 bits while still supporting byte-granularity writes.

Many timing parameters remain under the control of the DRAM controller. For example, a minimum time must elapse between a row being activated and a read or write command. One important parameter must be programmed into the SDRAM chip itself, namely the CAS latency. This is the number of clock cycles allowed for internal operations between a read command and the first data word appearing on the data bus. The &quot;Load mode register&quot; command is used to transfer this value to the SDRAM chip. Other configurable parameters include the length of read and write bursts, i.e. the number of words transferred per read or write command.

The most significant change, and the primary reason that SDRAM has supplanted asynchronous RAM, is the support for multiple internal banks inside the DRAM chip. Using a few bits of &quot;bank address&quot; that accompany each command, a second bank can be activated and begin reading data &quot;while a read from the first bank is in progress&quot;. By alternating banks, a single SDRAM device can keep the data bus continuously busy, in a way that asynchronous DRAM cannot.

====Single data rate synchronous DRAM====
Single data rate SDRAM (SDR SDRAM or SDR) is the original generation of SDRAM; it made a single transfer of data per clock cycle.

====Double data rate synchronous DRAM====
Double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM or DDR) was a later development of SDRAM, used in PC memory beginning in 2000. Subsequent versions are numbered sequentially (&quot;DDR2&quot;, &quot;DDR3&quot;, etc.). DDR SDRAM internally performs double-width accesses at the clock rate, and uses a double data rate interface to transfer one half on each clock edge. DDR2 and DDR3 increased this factor to 4× and 8×, respectively, delivering 4-word and 8-word bursts over 2 and 4 clock cycles, respectively. The internal access rate is mostly unchanged (200 million per second for DDR-400, DDR2-800 and DDR3-1600 memory), but each access transfers more data.

====Direct Rambus DRAM====
&quot;Direct RAMBUS DRAM&quot; (&quot;DRDRAM&quot;) was developed by Rambus. First supported on motherboards in 1999, it was intended to become an industry standard, but was outcompeted by DDR SDRAM, making it technically obsolete by 2003.

====Reduced Latency DRAM====
Reduced Latency DRAM (RLDRAM) is a high performance double data rate (DDR) SDRAM that combines fast, random access with high bandwidth, mainly intended for networking and caching applications.

===Graphics RAM===
Graphics RAMs are asynchronous and synchronous DRAMs designed for graphics-related tasks such as texture memory and framebuffers, found on video cards.

====Video DRAM====
Video DRAM (VRAM) is a dual-ported variant of DRAM that was once commonly used to store the frame-buffer in some graphics adaptors.

====Window DRAM====
Window DRAM (WRAM) is a variant of VRAM that was once used in graphics adaptors such as the Matrox Millennium and ATI 3D Rage Pro. WRAM was designed to perform better and cost less than VRAM. WRAM offered up to 25% greater bandwidth than VRAM and accelerated commonly used graphical operations such as text drawing and block fills.

====Multibank DRAM====

Multibank DRAM (MDRAM) is a type of specialized DRAM developed by MoSys. It is constructed from small memory banks of , which are operated in an interleaved fashion, providing bandwidths suitable for graphics cards at a lower cost to memories such as SRAM. MDRAM also allows operations to two banks in a single clock cycle, permitting multiple concurrent accesses to occur if the accesses were independent. MDRAM was primarily used in graphic cards, such as those featuring the Tseng Labs ET6x00 chipsets. Boards based upon this chipset often had the unusual capacity of because of MDRAM&#x27;s ability to be implemented more easily with such capacities. A graphics card with of MDRAM had enough memory to provide 24-bit color at a resolution of 1024×768—a very popular setting at the time.

====Synchronous graphics RAM====
Synchronous graphics RAM (SGRAM) is a specialized form of SDRAM for graphics adaptors. It adds functions such as bit masking (writing to a specified bit plane without affecting the others) and block write (filling a block of memory with a single colour). Unlike VRAM and WRAM, SGRAM is single-ported. However, it can open two memory pages at once, which simulates the dual-port nature of other video RAM technologies.

====Graphics double data rate SDRAM====

Graphics double data rate SDRAM is a type of specialized DDR SDRAM designed to be used as the main memory of graphics processing units (GPUs). GDDR SDRAM is distinct from commodity types of DDR SDRAM such as DDR3, although they share some core technologies. Their primary characteristics are higher clock frequencies for both the DRAM core and I/O interface, which provides greater memory bandwidth for GPUs. As of 2020, there are seven, successive generations of GDDR: GDDR2, GDDR3, GDDR4, GDDR5, GDDR5X, GDDR6 and GDDR6X.

===Pseudostatic RAM===

Pseudostatic RAM (PSRAM or PSDRAM) is dynamic RAM with built-in refresh and address-control circuitry to make it behave similarly to static RAM (SRAM). It combines the high density of DRAM with the ease of use of true SRAM. PSRAM is used in the Apple iPhone and other embedded systems such as XFlar Platform.

Some DRAM components have a &quot;self-refresh mode&quot;. While this involves much of the same logic that is needed for pseudo-static operation, this mode is often equivalent to a standby mode. It is provided primarily to allow a system to suspend operation of its DRAM controller to save power without losing data stored in DRAM, rather than to allow operation without a separate DRAM controller as is in the case of mentioned PSRAMs.

An embedded variant of PSRAM was sold by MoSys under the name 1T-SRAM. It is a set of small DRAM banks with an SRAM cache in front to make it behave much like a true SRAM. It is used in Nintendo GameCube and Wii video game consoles.

Cypress Semiconductor&#x27;s HyperRAM is a type of PSRAM supporting a JEDEC-compliant 8-pin HyperBus or Octal xSPI interface.

<text>Carl Gustaf Verner von Heidenstam (6 July 1859 – 20 May 1940) was a Swedish poet, novelist and laureate of the 1916 Nobel Prize in Literature. He was a member of the Swedish Academy from 1912. His poems and prose work are filled with a great joy of life, sometimes imbued with a love of Swedish history and scenery, particularly its physical aspects.

== Early life ==

Verner von Heidenstam was born in Olshammar, Örebro County, on 6 July 1859 to a noble family. Von Heidenstam was the son of Gustaf von Heidenstam, an engineer, and &quot;Magdalena&quot; Charlotta von Heidenstam (née Rütterskiöld). He was educated at &quot;Beskowska skolan&quot; in Stockholm.

He studied painting in the Academy of Stockholm but soon left because of ill health. He then traveled extensively in Europe, Africa and the Orient.

== Literary career ==
He was at once greeted as a poet of promise on the publication of his first collection of poems, &quot;Vallfart och vandringsår&quot; (&quot;Pilgrimage: the Wander Years&quot;, 1888). It is a collection of poems inspired by his experiences in the orient and marks an abandonment of naturalism that was dominant then in Swedish literature.

His love for beauty is also shown by the long narrative poem &quot;Hans Alienus &quot;(1892). &quot;Dikter&quot; (&quot;Poems&quot;, 1895) and &quot;Karolinerna&quot; (&quot;The Charles Men&quot;, 2 vols., 1897–1898), a series of historical portraits of King Charles XII of Sweden and his cavaliers, shows a strong nationalistic passion. English translations of short stories from &quot;Karolinerna&quot; can be found in the &quot;American-Scandinavian Review&quot; (New York), May 1914, November 1915, and July 1916. The two volumes of &quot;Folkunga Trädet&quot; (&quot;The Tree of the Folkungs&quot;, 1905–07) are the inspired, epic story of a clan of Swede chieftains in the Middle Ages.

In 1910, a controversy was waged in Swedish newspapers between a number of Swedish literary men on the topic of the proletarian “degradation” of literature, the protagonists of the two opposing camps being August Strindberg and von Heidenstam. Professors Lidforss and Böök also took part. von Heidenstam&#x27;s chief contribution was the pamphlet, directed chiefly against Strindberg, &quot;Proletärfilosofiens upplösning och fall&quot; (&quot;The Decline and Fall of the Proletarian Philosophy&quot;).

von Heidenstam&#x27;s poetical collection &quot;Nya Dikter&quot;, published in 1915, deals with philosophical themes, mainly concerning the elevation of man to a better humanity from solitude.

== Personal life ==

He died at his home Övralid on 20 May 1940.

<text>National Socialist black metal (also known as NSBM or [[Nazism|Nazi]] black metal,) is a political movement within the black metal music scene that promotes neo-Nazism, neo-fascism, and white supremacist ideologies. NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with ethnic European paganism, Satanism, or Nazi occultism, or a combination thereof, and vehemently oppose Christianity, Islam and Judaism from a racialist viewpoint. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a &quot;völkisch&quot; movement within black metal. According to Mattias Gardell, NSBM musicians see this ideology as &quot;a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal&quot;.

NSBM artists do not always explicitly express their political beliefs in their music, instead, they express their beliefs offstage. Artists who hold far-right or white nationalist beliefs but do not express them in their music are not considered NSBM artists by artists who participate in the greater black metal scene, but they may be considered NSBM artists by outside analysts. Some black metal bands have also made references to Nazi Germany purely for shock value, much like some punk rock and heavy metal bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or claim to appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.

The emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the early Norwegian black metal scene in the early 1990s, particularly through the band Burzum, whose sole member, Varg Vikernes, developed his anti-Christian beliefs into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of Heathenry. The German band Absurd further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes. The United States bands Judas Iscariot and Grand Belial&#x27;s Key also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement (the former has since distanced themselves from the movement). As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing white power musical forms such as Rock Against Communism, hatecore, and the far-right faction of Oi!. The neo-Nazi record label Resistance Records started releasing NSBM recordings and even purchased Vikernes&#x27; label Cymophane Records. The associated United States political organization National Alliance white supremacist William Luther Pierce also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik Möbus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In 2012, the NSBM Asgardsrei festival was established in Moscow, Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to Kyiv, Ukraine.

==Black metal==

Black metal originated in the 1980s from the work of thrash metal bands such as Venom (whose 1982 album &quot;Black Metal&quot; coined the term), Mercyful Fate, Bathory, Slayer, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost, and Sodom. These bands did not form a scene of their own, nor did they have a common musical style. A lyrical focus that is anti-Christian, Satanist, neopagan, or a combination thereof, is often considered a prerequisite for the genre, and originally the term &quot;black metal&quot; was synonymous with &quot;Satanic metal&quot;. A stricter definition still requires Satanism for a band to be classified as black metal. Non-Satanic bands from the same surroundings originally used other terms for their own music, such as pagan metal or Viking metal. In the late-1980s and early-1990s, the early Norwegian black metal scene, developed by bands such as Mayhem, Thorns, Immortal, Darkthrone, Burzum, Emperor, Satyricon, and Ulver, established a more specific sonic template that came to define Norwegian black metal and subsequently a great part of black metal in general, although other styles of black metal, like war metal, still exist. Common traits of Norwegian black metal include a fast tempo, blast beats and double-bass drumming, a thin, shrieking vocal style heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking and power chords, either lo-fi or well-produced recordings, an emphasis on atmosphere, and an &quot;unholy&quot; aesthetic. Keyboards are sometimes used, as are elements of neoclassical, folk, and ambient music. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. Many black metal artists prefer to be underground, inaccessible to the mainstream, and even intentionally push away audiences and demonstrate anti-social behavior.

== History ==
=== Origins in the Norwegian black metal scene ===

In the early 1990s, the early Norwegian black metal scene developed black metal into a distinct genre. The scene members were fiercely anti-Christian — most generally presented themselves as misanthropic devil-worshipers who wanted to spread hatred, sorrow and evil, though some wrote about pre-Christian Scandinavia and its mythology. Among some members of the scene, the antagonism toward Christianity turned violent, and arson and attempted arson was perpetrated against a number of churches from 1992 through 1995. Among the perpetrators were Varg Vikernes of Burzum and Mayhem, Euronymous of Mayhem, Samoth of Thou Shalt Suffer and Emperor, Faust of Thorns and Jørn Inge Tunsberg of Old Funeral, Immortal, and Hades Almighty, some of whom are among the most prominent musicians in the scene. In January 1993, Vikernes spoke with a journalist from &quot;Bergens Tidende&quot;. The loft where the interview was conducted was filled with Satanist and Nazi paraphernalia, along with weapons, and Vikernes declared he was at war with Christianity, had already burned eight churches, and would continue his terrorism.

The violence and misanthropy in the scene also included murder. In August 1992, Faust killed a gay man — Magne Andreassen — who had propositioned him in Lillehammer. Faust was not caught for a year, despite his actions being an open secret known to many in the scene. Many have attributed the murder to homophobia; however, Gaahl, a vocalist from the band Gorgoroth, is now an openly gay man who was voted Gay Person of the Year in 2010 in Bergen, and believes that the killing of Andreassen by Faust had nothing to do with Andreassen&#x27;s sexuality. Likewise, Faust himself, along with bandmate Ihsahn, have claimed that Andreassen&#x27;s sexuality was irrelevant, and Faust simply had a murderous impulse. In August 1993, Vikernes, with Snorre Ruch from Thorns and Mayhem as an accomplice, killed his bandmate Euronymous and was arrested shortly after. Vikernes was convicted in the spring of 1994 for arson, murder, and illegal possession of weapons. Vikernes insists that he killed Euronymous in self-defense, although while in prison claimed that it was also because Euronymous was gay and communist. Euronymous was interested in communism, even professing to be a Stalinist in 1992, and in the 1980s had participated in the Marxist–Leninist youth group Rød Ungdom, which he later disavowed, but there is no evidence that he was a gay man. Despite Vikernes&#x27; later claims, the killing is not believed to have been politically motivated, which even Vikernes claimed at first, and is generally thought to have been because of a personal dispute.

There is an undercurrent of ethnic nationalism in black metal, and racism is not uncommon in the scene even though most black metal and other extreme metal musicians disavow neo-Nazism and racist ideology. Within the Scandinavian scene, several musicians made racist statements and utilized Nazi language and paraphernalia — yet, black metal is also highly performative, intentionally contradictory, and artistically transgressive, and many of its musicians cultivate an evil, ultra-right-wing image as an aesthetic. Many of the artists who flirted with fascism, totalitarianism, and violence in their artistic themes did not find a political connection with that imagery. Still, a minority in the scene, in their opposition to Christianity and reverence for a pre-Christian past, stepped into fascist and racist ideas, particularly Nazi occultism. Euronymous in a personal letter in the early 1990s made the sweeping claim that &quot;Almost ALL Norwegian bands are more less nazis [sic]. Burzum, Mayhem, Emperor, Arcturus, Enslaved, you name them.&quot; Similarly, scholar Kirsten Dyck has described the Norwegian scene&#x27;s &quot;Black Circle&quot; as neo-Nazi. According to her, the Black Circle melded Nazi occultism, anti-Semitism and the conspiracy theory of a Jewish plot for world domination, homophobia, and xenophobia with Nietzschean philosophy, Satanism, and Scandinavian neopaganism, which then contributed to the violence perpetrated by some of the musicians.

In 1994, Hellhammer, the drummer for the Norwegian band Mayhem, said of the genre&#x27;s links with racism: &quot;I&#x27;ll put it this way, we don&#x27;t like black people here. Black Metal is for white people&quot;. When Mayhem re-formed after Euronymous&#x27;s death, they began releasing merchandise bearing World War II-era Nazi symbols. However, in a later interview, Hellhammer said &quot;I don&#x27;t give a crap if the fans are white, black, green, yellow, or blue. For me music and politics don&#x27;t go hand in hand&quot;. In 1995, Gaahl described &quot;niggers&quot; and &quot;mulattoes&quot; as &quot;subhuman&quot; and stated his admiration for Vikernes and Adolf Hitler. However, he too has since distanced himself from these statements. Vikernes also wrote some lyrics for the album &quot;Transilvanian Hunger&quot; by Darkthrone, another key band in the Norwegian scene. It was released in 1994 with &quot;Norsk Arisk Black Metal&quot; (&#x27;Norwegian Aryan Black Metal&#x27;) printed on the back cover, and issued a press release stating &quot;If any man should attempt to criticize this LP, he should be thoroughly patronized for his obviously Jewish behavior.&quot; After the ensuing controversy, Darkthrone claimed that &quot;Jew&quot; is simply a Norwegian word for &quot;stupid&quot; and that they were &quot;not a Nazi band nor a political band&quot;. In a 2007 documentary, bandmember Fenriz claimed he was once arrested while participating in an anti-apartheid demonstration and later had a &quot;phase of being really angry with ... other races&quot; before he became &quot;totally unengaged in [political] shit&quot;. Scholar Keith Kahn-Harris argues that it is almost impossible to believe that Darkthrone did not know that a pejorative use of the word &quot;Jew&quot; was offensive, and the denials from Darkthrone that the members had racist or fascist sympathies was disingenuous, given the statements made. But, Kahn-Harris also notes that Fenriz has made more jocular references to racism and fascism, and has interacted well with black metal enthusiasts from Israel, so Kahn-Harris believes that the actions by Darkthrone were intentionally contradictory as a form of transgressive artistic discourse and not expressions of a sincere ideology. Axl Rosenberg from the website MetalSucks notes that after these offensive actions from the band in the mid-1990s, Darkthrone has not repeatedly demonstrated racist behavior. He opines that the band members are far older now and that &quot;it’s feasible their worldviews have changed; it’s feasible they were being provocative for the sake of being provocative when they made &quot;Hunger&quot; and have since seen the error of such sophomoric behavior.&quot; After his release from prison, Faust stated regarding the arson and murder he committed that &quot;I was never a Satanist or fascist in any way, but I put behind me the hatred and negativity. Those feelings just eat you up from inside.&quot;

Similar statements were also uttered by scene members from other countries. Michael W. Ford of the American band Black Funeral mentioned that Nazi occultism was very important to him, called his former band Sorath his &quot;old SS Death squad&quot; and claimed &quot;you have to be white to play Black metal&quot;. We was the American leader of Cymophane, an organisation started by Vikernes. He would later disassociate himself from Nazism. According to the authors of &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;, in 1995, three Swedish black-metallers (including Mika &quot;Belfagor&quot; Hakola of the band Nefandus) went on a &quot;niggerhunt&quot; in Linköping. Wielding an axe and two machetes, they &quot;terrorized&quot; a black man. Nefandus were later &quot;considered to be Nazi sympathizers&quot;, though Belfagor explained: &quot;This could not be further from the truth, but I guess this has to do with some of the controversial comments I made in various magazines in my youth, when I still aspired to play in the most hated band in the world. I used a lot of provocative language back then. But to sort things out: I associate with people of all creeds and colours. ... So to be labeled a Nazi or a racist is very offensive to me&quot;.

Vikernes and his project Burzum are generally seen as the main catalyst in the development of the NSBM movement, although Burzum was never explicitly political. Although Vikernes has claimed to not be a neo-Nazi, he has participated in neo-Nazi activities and his statements have expressed neo-Nazi views and antagonism toward Muslims and Jews. According to an interview in &quot;Blood &amp; Honour&quot; magazine, Vikernes contacted neo-Nazi organization Zorn 88 in 1992 and joined White Aryan Resistance before he killed Euronymous. While in prison, &quot;Vikernes began to formulate his nationalist heathen ideology&quot; and wrote a manifesto called &quot;Vargsmål&quot;. It became available on the internet for a while in 1996, and in 1997 it was printed by a Norwegian publisher. Once imprisoned, Vikernes abandoned the black metal scene and started touting a neo-Nazi variety of Heathenry. According to Vikernes, he stopped playing metal music because of its origin as &quot;Negro music&quot;, and argued that &quot;the &#x27;metal heads&#x27; tend to behave like a bunch of &#x27;White Niggers&#x27;, so to speak, with their sex, drugs and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll culture.&quot; Vikernes also has claimed that the scene had begun &quot;as a nationalistic (Norwegian-centric), racist and anti-Christian revolt&quot; but was &quot;hijacked&quot; by the &quot;Jew-dominated music industry&quot;. He claims the industry made it into another tool with which to destroy Europe, by promoting bands who embraced &quot;everything sick and anti-European on this planet, from porn and promiscuity to drugs and homosexuality&quot;.

=== Development of National Socialist black metal ===
One of the first explicitly NSBM releases was the 1995 demo &quot;Thuringian Pagan Madness&quot; by German band Absurd. It was recorded while the members were imprisoned for murdering a boy from their school. On the demo cover is a photograph of his gravestone and the inlay contained pro-Nazi statements. Bandmember Hendrik Möbus stated that NSBM was the &quot;logical conclusion&quot; of the Norwegian black metal movement and interpreted the church burnings as a &quot;cultural atavism&quot;. Other bands deemed to be part of the early NSBM scene include Graveland and Infernum, from Poland. Rob Darken of Graveland in particular was a very central figure in the development of NSBM in Poland. The burgeoning black metal scene in Poland was far more pronouncedly racist, and The Temple of Fullmoon, of which several Polish bands were members, turned into a far-right organization. Similar to what happened in Norway, the scene became increasingly violent, and three of the four members of the NSBM band Thunderbolt were imprisoned for arson and murder. According to Gunnar Sauermann, in the 1990s, some of the earliest American black metal bands—like Grand Belial&#x27;s Key and Judas Iscariot—joined an international NSBM organization called the Pagan Front, although Judas Iscariot&#x27;s sole member Akhenaten left the organization. Thelemnar, the drummer of German band Secrets of the Moon, said he got to know him &quot;only as an intelligent person and never as a Nazi&quot;. The United States project I Shalt Become was another pioneer in the nascent NSBM scene. NSBM came to dominate the black metal scenes in Poland, Ukraine, and Russia.

In 2012, Alexey Levkin, frontman of the band , along with others, started the NSBM music festival Asgardsrei in Moscow. The event is named after the 1999 album of the same name by Absurd. The festival was relocated to Kyiv in 2014 when Levkin and the other organizers relocated to Ukraine to join the Azov Assault Brigade. Steelfest is a Finnish annual black metal festival that has been held since 2012. Steelfest is notorious for hosting a venue for National socialist black metal bands, and bands and audience have done mass nazi salutes.

== Ideology ==
NSBM typically melds Neo-Nazi beliefs (such as fascism, white supremacy, white separatism, white nationalism, right-wing extremism, antisemitism, xenophobia, and ethnic separatism, with some National-anarchist tendencies and admiration of Adolf Hitler) with hostility to &quot;foreign&quot; religions. Bands often promote ethnic European paganism, occultism, or Satanism. Hendrik Möbus of Absurd described Nazism as the &quot;most perfect (and only realistic!) synthesis of Satanic/Luciferian will to power, elitist Social Darwinism, connected to Aryan Germanic paganism&quot;. Members of the band Der Stürmer (named after the antisemitic newspaper edited by Julius Streicher) subscribe to Esoteric Nazism, leaning on the works of Savitri Devi and Julius Evola. Famine of Peste Noire stated in an interview that he prefers Italian Fascism instead of Nazism as an ideology.

=== Anti-Christianity and antisemitism ===
Typically NSBM musicians regard Christianity as a product of an alleged Jewish conspiracy to undermine the Aryan race by eliminating their &quot;Artglauben&quot; and their &quot;original&quot; culture. These musicians usually reject the legitimacy of Christian antisemitism as well as the German Christians movement, which celebrated and promoted Nazi ideology in the context of an unorthodox Christian theological framework. Hjarulv Henker of the band Der Stürmer said:
=== White supremacy ===
NSBM musicians such as Varg Vikernes of Burzum and Famine of Peste Noire have expressed a white supremacist concern about &quot;race mixing&quot; and preserving the purity of the white race and the traditional cultures of white European nations. Somewhat perplexingly, NSBM has been popular in Poland and other Slavic countries, despite the fact that, historically, German Nazis viewed Slavic people as subhuman racial inferiors and intended to eliminate them. This contradiction is either masked, relativized or excused as a historical mistake. A conspiracy theory says the Jews would have prevented an alliance between Nazi Germany and other Eastern European countries. Knjaz Varggoth, singer and guitarist of the Ukrainian band Nokturnal Mortum, gives the following explanation for the contradiction: &quot;Goruth of the Russian band Temnozor sees the Slavs and Germans as a part of a Hyperborean Aryan race and nowadays differing due to its degeneration.&quot;

The Vietnamese-American band Vothana is unusual in that its members are not ethnically European, however the band’s lyrics (which are performed in Vietnamese) still express racialist and fascist viewpoints and the band has performed at festivals alongside NSBM bands.

=== Paganism ===

As part of their anti-Christianity, anti-Semitism, and the idea that White Europeans should return to their &quot;native&quot; ways, most NSBM bands promote ethnic European paganism. Benjamin Hedge Olson argues that NSBM is &quot;indelibly linked with Asá Trŭ and opposed to Satanism, which gives it a &#x27;blood and soil&#x27; attraction to many young Neo-Nazis looking for identity in their distant, ancestral past.&quot; Hendrik Möbus interpreted the church burnings in Norway as:
 He argues that later on they would have realized the meaning of these emotions, begun to identify with paganism and taken &quot;an active interest in Nationalist politics designed to preserve and to cultivate this very heritage&quot;. The booklet of the Absurd EP &quot;Asgardsrei&quot; depicts the Knights Templar, the Teutonic Order and the Waffen-SS as warriors of the &quot;Asgardsrei&quot;, which the bands define as a term for an alleged godly and Germanic group of warriors.

=== Satanism ===
Besides pagan beliefs, part of the NSBM scene embraces an interpretation of Satanism. Satanism is a common theme even in apolitical black metal, but in NSBM Satan is depicted as an ancient Aryan counterpart to YHWH, the god of the Jews and Christians. This view is often called &quot;völkisch Satanism&quot; or &quot;Aryan Satanism&quot;. Chraesvelgoron of The True Frost sees Nazism as the political appearance of Satanism and the collective deification of man as a social animal, as godliness instead of humaneness. His bandmate Sadorass calls the same ideology a development of blood and soil ideology, diverse occult teachings, and the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche in connection to Darwinism. Greek black metal musician Magus Wampyr Daoloth (of Necromantia and Thou Art Lord) said in an interview for &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot;: &quot;If you consider that fascism and Satanism have a lot of similarities as they both advocate power, spiritual and physical excellence, responsibility, survival of the fittest, elitism, etc., it&#x27;s logical that some bands advocate both&quot;. However, many pagan and far-right bands see Satanism as a part of Christianity or Judaism.

== Connections with broader white nationalist movements ==
Many white nationalists have warmly received NSBM for its lyrical content and ideals. However, some have not, due to the music style as well as the genre&#x27;s perceived association with the rock &amp; roll lifestyle. However, &quot;Lords of Chaos&quot; notes that alcohol and illegal drugs never played a big part in the Norwegian black metal scene. Bård G. Eithun, on the other hand, stated that many in the early scene &quot;were almost alcoholics&quot;. Some also reject black metal musicians and fans since many of them have long hair, which they associate with hippies and left-wingers. Dayal Patterson writes that &quot;NSBM has become a movement in its own right,&quot; one which has reached Western Europe and the Americas and overlapped with fans of more traditional far-right music genres such as Oi! and Rock Against Communism.

The record label Resistance Records, a Canadian record label promoting white nationalism and white separatism, purchased Vikernes&#x27; Cymophane Records and began releasing black metal recordings, many through a sub-label, Unholy Records. William Luther Pierce, founder of the white nationalist National Alliance, sought to promote NSBM as well as other forms of white nationalist music through Resistance, believing that music would &quot;make the National Alliance rich and spread its message most effectively&quot;. To this end, he accommodated Absurd frontman Hendrik Möbus while the latter had fled to the United States to evade German authorities. Although Pierce appreciated the ideological mindset of NSBM and Resistance Records, as well as the financial gains, the music did not personally appeal to him, and he attacked the &quot;sex, drugs &amp; rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll&quot; and what he called &quot;negroid&quot; influences.

Asgardsrei festival, which has established itself as the major festival for NSBM, has been noted by analysts and journalists to function as a meetup point and pan-European and transnational networking hub for neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other far-right extremists. In addition to the concert organizers&#x27; connections to the Ukrainian nationalist Azov Assault Brigade, Ukrainian far-right political party National Corps, and Russian-Ukrainian neo-Nazi movement Wotanjugend, members of the German neo-Nazi party The III. Path, the United States-based neo-Nazi terrorist organization Atomwaffen Division, the Italian neo-fascist movement and former political party CasaPound, and the Greek neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn have all participated in the festival. Members of neo-Nazi forums and chats such as Iron March, Stormfront, and neo-Nazi chat servers on Discord have attended and praised Asgardsrei, and the American white nationalist Greg Johnson posted a review of the 2019 festival on his alt-right publication Counter Currents.

== Connections to black metal scene ==
NSBM artists are a minority within black metal, according to Mattias Gardell. They have also been rejected or strongly criticized by many prominent black metal musicians – including Jon Nödtveidt, Tormentor, King ov Hell, Infernus, Lord Ahriman, Emperor Magus Caligula, Protector, Erik Danielsson of Watain, and the members of Arkhon Infaustus. Some black-metallers liken Nazism to Christianity in that it is authoritarian, collectivist, and involves a &quot;herd mentality&quot;. It also conflicts with the misanthropic views of many artists; Benjamin Hedge Olson writes that the shunning of Nazism within the scene &quot;has nothing to do with notions of a &#x27;universal humanity&#x27; or a rejection of hate&quot; but that Nazism is shunned &quot;because its hatred is too specific and exclusive&quot;. Joakim of Craft said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think national socialism mix[es] with the ideology of real Black Metal in a way, but that doesn&#x27;t go further than labels. I only think NS Black Metal is an inappropriate label for the music&quot;. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM bands and labels, others draw a line between the music and the musicians, as they only care for the music. Some have criticized this as passive support for NSBM. The bigger print metal magazines tend to ignore records by NSBM bands. Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Unheilige Allianzen&quot; caused a short debate, leading &quot;Legacy&quot; magazine to stop printing ads for NSBM labels. Another debate happened in the &quot;letters&quot; section of &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine following the article &quot;Der rechte Rand im Black Metal&quot; (&quot;Black Metal&#x27;s Far-right Border&quot;). According to &quot;Unheilige Allianzen&quot;, völkisch pagan metal and neo-Nazism were the current trends in black metal and in turn, were affecting the broader metal scene. Stewart Voegtlin likewise wrote for &quot;Stylus&quot; in 2006 that &quot;with a &#x27;nationalistic&#x27; wave of violence and hatred spreading from Scandinavia and infiltrating France and Germany, the unfortunate exploits of a few will likely continue to supersede the music itself.&quot;

== Denial of identification ==
Some bands have denied being labeled NSBM, and assert that they are either pagan or instead prefer the label &quot;nationalist black metal.&quot; Official statements against this label have been made by bands such as Graveland. Akitsa, a group sometimes rumoured to be NSBM, made strong statements against the Nazi ideology and the whole NSBM genre. Ukrainian band Nokturnal Mortum has made efforts to distance themselves from the movement, but still continue to occasionally partake in some NSBM practices such as playing at festivals held for the genre. 

While some bands made statements which the scene and critics has taken as genuine statements condemning Nazism, other bands&#x27; statements has, by many critics, been viewed merely as a tactic to be able to play live gigs or not have their music banned, such is the case with Graveland, among others, who has continued to openly support white supremacist organizers after making statements about being &quot;unpolitical&quot;.

<doc id="74573" wikidata="Q400" url="?curid=74573" title="Jenna Jameson">
<text>Jenna Marie Massoli (born April 9, 1974), known professionally as Jenna Jameson (), is an American businesswoman, writer, television personality, and former pornographic film actress. She has been named the world&#x27;s most famous adult entertainment performer and &quot;The Queen of Porn&quot;.

Jameson started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a stripper and glamour model. By 1996, she had won the &quot;Top Newcomer&quot; award from each of the three major adult movie organizations. She has since won more than 35 adult-video awards, and has been inducted into the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) and Adult Video News (AVN) Halls of Fame.

Jameson founded the adult-entertainment company ClubJenna in 2000 with Jay Grdina, whom she later married and divorced. Initially, a single website, this business expanded into managing similar websites of other stars and began producing sexually explicit videos in 2001. The first such movie, &quot;Briana Loves Jenna&quot; (with Briana Banks), was named at the 2003 AVN Awards as the best-selling and best-renting pornographic title for 2002. By 2005, ClubJenna had revenues of US$30 million with profits estimated at half that.

Jameson has also crossed over into mainstream pop culture, starting with a minor role in Howard Stern&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Private Parts&quot;. Her mainstream appearances continued with several guest-hosting and guest-starring on various television programs. Playboy TV hosted her &quot;Jenna&#x27;s American Sex Star&quot; reality show, in which aspiring porn stars competed for a ClubJenna contract. Her 2004 autobiography, &quot;How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale&quot;, spent six weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Jameson announced her retirement from pornography at the 2008 AVN Awards, stating that she would never return to the industry. Although she no longer performs in pornographic films, she began working as a webcam model in 2013.
== Early life ==
Jenna Marie Massoli was born on April 9, 1974, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Her father, Laurence Henry Massoli, was a police officer at the Las Vegas Sheriff&#x27;s Department and program director for KSNV-DT. Her mother, Judith Brooke Hunt, was a Las Vegas showgirl who danced in the Folies Bergère show at the Tropicana Resort &amp; Casino. Her mother died of melanoma on February 20, 1976, two months before her daughter&#x27;s second birthday. The cancer treatments bankrupted the family and they relocated in Nevada, Arizona and Montana, usually living in a trailer home or with her paternal grandmother. She and her older brother Tony were raised Catholic, though they were essentially left to parent each other.

Jameson was a frequent entrant in beauty pageants as a child and enrolled in ballet classes throughout her childhood. In a featurette on the &quot;Zombie Strippers&quot; DVD, Jameson indicates she trained in dance for 15 years.

Jameson wrote in her autobiography that in October 1990, when she was 16 years old and while the family was living on a cattle ranch in Fromberg, Montana, she was beaten with rocks and gang raped by four boys after a football game at Fromberg High School. The incident began after she attempted to hitchhike home and she entered the car of the four boys while believing that she would be driven to her home. She reported being raped a second time while still 16 by &quot;Preacher&quot;, her boyfriend Jack&#x27;s biker uncle. Preacher has denied the rape ever occurred. Rather than tell her father, she left home and moved in with Jack in her first serious relationship.

Jack was a tattoo artist and gave her the first of a series of tattoos, one of which would become her trademark tattoo, two hearts on her right buttock. According to E!, her brother Tony, who later owned a tattoo parlor himself, added the inscription &quot;Heart Breaker&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Early ===
Jameson tried to follow in her mother&#x27;s career as a Las Vegas showgirl, but most shows rejected her for not having the then-typical height of . She was hired at Disneyland Resort, but she left after two months, stating concerns over the schedule and salary.

Her boyfriend Jack encouraged her to apply for jobs as a dancer, and in 1991, though underage, she began dancing in Las Vegas strip clubs using a fake identification. After she was rejected from the Crazy Horse Too strip club because of her braces, she removed them with pliers and was accepted. After six months, she was earning US$2,000 per night, before graduating from Bonanza High School.

Her first stage name as a dancer was &quot;Jennasis&quot;, which she later used as the name of a business that she incorporated (&quot;Jennasis Killing Co.&quot;). As for picking her permanent professional name, she said, &quot;I had to come up with a good name. I didn&#x27;t want a porno name. So I sat down, opened up the phone book and thumbed to the J&#x27;s, cause I wanted it to match my first name.&quot; She saw &#x27;James&#x27;, but rejected &quot;Jenna James&quot; because it &quot;sounds too porno&quot;. Right under that was &#x27;Jameson&#x27; which struck her as being the name of the whiskey she likes and thought &quot;Ok, that&#x27;s perfect.&quot; That night at work she saw her brother and asked him what he thought of the name &quot;Jenna Jameson&quot;. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m drinking Jameson right now.&quot; And the name stuck after that.

Besides dancing, starting later in 1991, she posed for nude photographs for photographer Suze Randall in Los Angeles, with the intention of getting into &quot;Penthouse&quot;. After her photos had appeared in several men&#x27;s magazines under various names, she then stopped working for Randall, feeling Randall was &quot;a shark&quot;.

While in high school, she began taking drugs – cocaine, LSD, and methamphetamine – accompanied by her brother (who was addicted to heroin) and at times her father. Her addiction worsened during her four years with her boyfriend. She eventually stopped eating properly and became too thin to model; Jack left her in 1994. She weighed when a friend put her in a wheelchair and sent her to her father, who was then living in Redding, California, in order to detox; her father did not recognize her when she got off the plane.
=== Pornographic film ===
Jameson says that she started acting in sex videos in retaliation for the infidelity of her boyfriend, Jack. She first appeared in an erotic film in 1993, a non-explicit softcore movie by Andrew Blake, with girlfriend Nikki Tyler. Her first pornographic movie scenes were filmed by Randy West and appeared in 1994&#x27;s &quot;Up and Cummers 10&quot; and &quot;Up and Cummers 11&quot;.

Of her first adult movie, Randy West said &quot;Jenna contacted me and said she wanted to get into the XXX business, but her agent didn&#x27;t want her to do porn. A month later I&#x27;m on a shoot in Woodland Hills (a San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles), and there&#x27;s Jenna. She said she wanted to get into the business, despite what her agent said. I told her if you want to just do a girl/girl scene, we can do that. She said she wanted to work with Kylie Ireland, so I set it up. When the sex started, she just fucking rocked! I knew Jenna was special right off the bat. I figured she&#x27;d be the next Ginger Lynn, but nobody had any idea she was going to be as big as she turned out to be. Jenna told me when we first met that she was going to be a star.&quot;

Jameson got her first breast implants on July 28, 1994, to enhance her stripping and movie careers.

Jameson&#x27;s first adult video appearances were lesbian scenes (a common way that female performers ease into the business). She says: &quot;Girl-on-girl was easy and natural. Then they offered me lots of money to do boy-girl.&quot; Her first heterosexual scene was in &quot;Up and Cummers 11&quot; (1994). At the beginning of her career, she promised herself that she would never do anal sex or double penetration scenes on film. Instead, her &quot;signature move&quot; was oral sex, lubricated with saliva. She has also never done any interracial sex scenes with men (despite that category&#x27;s runaway popularity during the 2000s).

In 1994, after overcoming her drug addiction by spending several weeks with her father and grandmother, Jameson relocated to Los Angeles to live with Nikki Tyler. Her first movie after that was &quot;Silk Stockings&quot;. Later in 1995, Wicked Pictures, a then small pornographic film production company, signed her to an exclusive contract. She remembers telling Wicked Pictures founder Steve Orenstein: &quot;The most important thing to me right now is to become the biggest star the industry has ever seen.&quot;

The contract earned Jameson US$6,000 for each of eight movies in her first year. Her first big-budget production was &quot;Blue Movie&quot; (1995), where she played a reporter investigating a porn set; it won multiple AVN Awards. In 1996, Jameson won top awards from three major industry organizations, the XRCO Best New Starlet award, the AVN Best New Starlet Award, and the Fans of X-Rated Entertainment (F.O.X.E.) Video Vixen award. She was the first entertainer to win all three awards.

By 2001, Jameson earned $60,000 for a day and a half of filming a single DVD, and $8,000 per night dancing at strip clubs. She tried to restrict herself to five films per year and two weeks of dancing per month. Her husband Jay Grdina has said that she earned as much as $25,000 per night dancing.

Between 2005 and 2006, she hosted Playboy TV&#x27;s &quot;Jenna&#x27;s American Sex Star&quot;, where prospective porn stars compete in sexual performances for a contract with her company, ClubJenna. Winners of the contracts for the first two years were Brea Bennett and Roxy Jezel.

In January 2008, Jameson confirmed she was retiring from pornographic performances and has since said that she &quot;won&#x27;t even do a &quot;Maxim&quot; cover&quot;.

Jameson&#x27;s first appearance at an adult-entertainment event since her retirement was at the 2013 Exxxotica New Jersey convention in October. On January 15, 2014, Fleshlight released Jameson&#x27;s signature artificial vagina. Jameson was also the master of ceremonies for the 2014 XBIZ Awards on January 24.

=== Business ventures ===
Jameson and Grdina formed ClubJenna as an Internet pornography company in 2000. ClubJenna.com was one of the first pornographic sites to provide more than pictures and videos; it provided explicit diaries, relationship advice, and even stock tips to paid members. The site reportedly was profitable in its third week. The business later diversified into multimedia pornographic entertainment, first by administering other porn stars&#x27; websites, then, in 2001, by the production of pornographic films.

Early ClubJenna films starred Jameson herself, limiting herself to on-screen sex with other women or with Grdina, who appeared as Justin Sterling. The first ClubJenna film, &quot;Briana Loves Jenna&quot; (2001), co-produced with Vivid, cost US$280,000 to make, and grossed over $1 million in its first year. It was the best selling and best-renting pornographic title of its year, winning twin AVN Awards. It was marketed as &quot;Jenna. Her first boy/girl scene in over 2 years.&quot; referring to Jameson&#x27;s abstention from heterosexual on-film intercourse. Grdina has said that Jameson&#x27;s films averaged sales of 100,000 copies, compared with run-of-the-mill pornographic films, which did well to sell 5,000. On the other hand, he also said that their films took up to twelve days to film, compared with one day for other pornographic films.

In a January 2009 interview with William Shatner on &quot;Shatner&#x27;s Raw Nerve&quot;, Jameson said she came close to buying &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazine when publisher Bob Guccione filed for Chapter 11 reorganization of his business (which occurred in August 2003), but was thwarted when someone else swooped in and bought up all the stock. &quot;New York Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Intelligencer&quot; quoted a source from Penthouse as saying &quot;I&#x27;m sure she is considering it&quot;, adding that Jameson was to be cover girl in January 2004 – and &quot;it&#x27;s a really wild-looking shoot, even for a porn star.&quot;

In 2004, the ClubJenna films expanded to starring other actresses without Jameson – Krystal Steal, Jesse Capelli, McKenzie Lee, Ashton Moore and Sophia Rossi – as Jameson stepped back from starring roles. In 2005 Jameson first directed a film, &quot;The Provocateur&quot;, released as &quot;Jenna&#x27;s Provocateur&quot; in September 2006. The ClubJenna films were distributed and marketed by Vivid Entertainment, which &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine once called &quot;the world&#x27;s largest adult film company&quot;. They made up a third of ClubJenna&#x27;s revenues, but over half of the profits.

ClubJenna was run as a family business, with Grdina&#x27;s sister, Kris, as vice president in charge of merchandising. In 2005, ClubJenna had estimated revenues of $30 million, with profits of about half that.

Jameson also capitalized on merchandising herself. Since May 2003, she has been appearing on a tall billboard in New York City&#x27;s Times Square promoting her web site and movies. The first advertisement displayed her wearing only a thong and read &quot;Who Says They Cleaned Up Times Square?&quot; There is a line of sex toys licensed to Doc Johnson, and an &quot;anatomically correct&quot; Jenna Jameson action figure. She stars in her own sex simulation video game, &quot;Virtually Jenna&quot;, in which the goal is to bring a 3D model of her to orgasm. Y-Tell, ClubJenna&#x27;s wireless company, sells Jenna Jameson &quot;moan tones&quot; (telephone ringtones), chat services, and games in partnerships with 20 carriers around the world, mostly in Europe and South America. In 2006, New York City-based Wicked Cow Entertainment started to expand her brand to barware, perfume, handbags, lingerie, and footwear, sold through high end retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Colette boutiques. Her film and merchandising success enabled her to attain her goal of becoming the top porn star in the world.

In August 2005, ClubJenna launched Club Thrust, an interactive website for Jameson&#x27;s gay male fans, which includes videos, galleries, sex advice, gossip, and downloads. The director of webmaster relations for ClubJenna said the straight site had always had a lot of gay traffic. By 2006, ClubJenna administered more than 150 official sites for other adult entertainment industry stars.

In August 2005, a group of business investors that included Jameson purchased Babes Cabaret, a strip club in Scottsdale, Arizona, intending to make it the first foray of ClubJenna into live entertainment. Soon after the purchase attracted attention, the Scottsdale City Council proposed a new ordinance banning nudity at adult-entertainment venues and requiring a four-foot divider restricting contact with dancers. Such a divider would have also effectively banned lap dances, the dancers&#x27; main source of revenue. Jameson argued strongly against the ordinance, and helped organize a petition against it. On September 12, 2006, in a referendum on the ordinance, voters struck down the stricter rules, allowing the club to continue to operate as before.

On February 3, 2006, Jameson hosted a &quot;Vivid ClubJenna Super Bowl Party&quot; with several other ClubJenna and Vivid Girls at the Zoo Club in Detroit, Michigan for a $500 to $1,000 ticket price. It featured a lingerie show, but no planned nudity or sex acts. When first announced, the party caused controversy with the National Football League, which did not sanction this as an official Super Bowl event. For 2007, Jameson signed up to play quarterback in the Lingerie Bowl, but retired due to her insurance company&#x27;s damage concerns. She instead acted as commentator.

On June 22, 2006, Playboy Enterprises announced that it had bought ClubJenna Inc., along with an agreement to have both Jameson and Grdina stay on as contracted executives. Playboy CEO Christie Hefner said that she expected to rapidly increase film production, producing about thirty features in the first year, and will expand the way they are sold, not only as DVDs but through TV channels, video-on-demand services, and mobile phones. On November 1, 2006, Playboy renamed one of the Spice Network&#x27;s pay-per-view channels from The Hot Network to ClubJenna.

=== Books ===

Jameson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale&quot; was published in 2004. It was co-written with Neil Strauss, a contributor to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and published by ReganBooks, a division of HarperCollins. It was an instant bestseller, spending six weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The autobiography also won the 2004 &quot;Mainstream&#x27;s Adult Media Favorite&quot; XRCO Award in a tie with Seymore Butts&#x27;s &quot;Family Business&quot; TV series. It was translated into German as &quot;Pornostar. Die Autobiographie&quot; in November 2005, and Spanish as &quot;Cómo Hacer El Amor Igual Que Una Estrella Porno&quot; in January 2006.

The book covers her early career from her beginning in show business living with her tattoo artist boyfriend, through receiving the Pornographic Hot d&#x27;Or award at Cannes, and wedding pictures from her second marriage. It does not omit sordid details, describing her two rapes, drug addictions, an unhappy first marriage, and numerous affairs with men and women. The first-person narrative is broken up by personal photos, childhood diary entries, family interviews, movie scripts, and comic panels.

The autobiography publisher, Judith Regan, also served as executive producer of a tie-in television news special, &quot;Jenna Jameson&#x27;s Confessions&quot;, airing on VH1 on August 16, 2004, one day before the book&#x27;s launch. In April 2005, ReganBooks and Jameson filed lawsuits against each other. The point of contention was a proposed reality show about Jameson&#x27;s everyday life, discussed between her then-husband, Jay Grdina, and the A&amp;E Network. ReganBooks maintained that any A&amp;E deal was a breach of Jameson&#x27;s contract, which indicated that ReganBooks had a stake in the profits generated by both the special based on her memoir and a reality-based series, as well as &quot;any similar projects&quot;. Jameson&#x27;s suit claimed that the A&amp;E deal preceded the ReganBooks contract. The reality series had still not materialized, and the lawsuit was still being discussed, when HarperCollins fired Judith Regan on December 15, 2006, over an unrelated issue.

In January 2007, Jameson was reported in talks with producers on turning the autobiography into a movie. In March 2007, Jameson was reportedly missing meetings with producers, thus endangering the movie, due to problems with a recent vaginoplasty.

In April 2013, Jameson announced she was working on a fictional erotic novel called &quot;Sugar&quot;. It was co-written with Hope Tarr and published by Skyhorse Publishing. It was released on October 21, 2013.

=== Mainstream appearances ===

Jameson is also known for achieving a high level of celebrity outside of pornography – even bringing pornography itself closer to mainstream society&#x27;s awareness and acceptance. She has said: &quot;I&#x27;ve always embraced my hard-core roots, but becoming a household name was an important thing to me.&quot;

In 1995, Jameson sent photos of herself to radio host Howard Stern. She became a regular guest on his show, appearing more than 30 times, and played the role of &quot;Mandy&quot;, the &quot;First Nude Woman on Radio&quot;, in Stern&#x27;s semi-autobiographical 1997 film &quot;Private Parts&quot;. This film appearance was the beginning of a series of non-porn film and television roles. In 1997, Jameson made an appearance for an Extreme Championship Wrestling pay-per-view, Hardcore Heaven &#x27;97 as the valet for The Dudley Boyz; another appearance at ECW Living Dangerously on March 1, 1998; and a few months where she was ECW&#x27;s on-screen interviewer. In 1998, she filmed a vignette with Val Venis, a character in the WWE, for airing on WWE programming. In the late 1990s, Jameson guest hosted several episodes of the E! cable network&#x27;s hit travel/adventure/party show &quot;Wild On!&quot;, appearing scantily clad in tropical locations. Jameson was featured and interviewed on the British television show &quot;European Blue Review&quot; on Channel 5.

Jameson appeared in a 2002 music video for the Eminem song &quot;Without Me&quot;. She can be seen in bed with Eminem as one of the &quot;two trailer park girls&quot; (the other one is fitness model Kiana Tom) that &quot;go round the outside&quot;. Jameson voiced an animated version of herself in a July 2001 episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot; entitled &quot;Brian Does Hollywood&quot;. Her character won an award for acting in a porn film directed by Brian Griffin, and at the close of the episode Peter Griffin kidnaps her. In 2002, Jameson and Ron Jeremy played themselves in Comedy Central&#x27;s first feature television movie &quot;Porn &#x27;n Chicken&quot;, in the roles of speakers for a pornography viewing club. Also in 2002, she appeared in two video games, most notably voicing Candy Suxxx in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. Her character begins as a prostitute, but goes on to become a successful pornographic actress and is displayed on several billboards within the game. Her performance won the 2003 G-Phoria &quot;Best Live Action/Voice Performance Award – Female&quot;. She also provided both the appearance and the voice for &quot;Daisy&quot;, a secret playable character for the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;, who performs provocative tricks with her clothing and skateboard. In 2003, Jameson appeared in two episodes of the NBC prime-time television show &quot;Mister Sterling&quot; as the girlfriend of a political financier.

In the months following the publication of her autobiography, she was interviewed on NBC, CNBC, Fox News, and CNN, and the book was reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Reuters, and other major media outlets.

Jameson was featured prominently in &quot;Samhain&quot;, a low budget horror film in which she starred with other pornographic actresses including Ginger Lynn Allen. It was filmed in 2002 but had sat unreleased until 2005, when it was re-cut and released as &quot;Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain&quot;. She had another minor horror film role in &quot;Sin-Jin Smyth&quot;, delayed from release until late 2006.

In February 2006, Comedy Central announced plans to feature Jameson as &quot;P-Whip&quot;, in a starring role in its first animated mobile phone series, &quot;Samurai Love God&quot;. &quot;Mediaweek&quot; called her the biggest name attached to the project. In April 2006, Jameson was the star of a video podcast ad for Adidas, advertising Adicolor shoes by playing a provocative game of whack a mole. Jameson made an appearance in the American reality TV show &quot;The Simple Life&quot; in the fifth-season episode &quot;Committed&quot;, broadcast on July 1, 2007; Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, while working in a &quot;love camp&quot;, brought her in to help throw a &quot;love ceremony&quot; vow for the five dysfunctional couples. In 2008, Jameson had another starring role in the comedy horror film &quot;Zombie Strippers&quot;, loosely based on Eugène Ionesco&#x27;s play &quot;Rhinoceros&quot;. Madame Tussauds has a wax model of Jameson.

On August 27, 2015, Jameson became a contestant on the sixteenth series of the British reality series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, representing the US.

==== Controversial mainstream appearances ====
Some of her mainstream appearances sparked controversy. An interview with Jameson contained in the 1999 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch &quot;A&amp;F Quarterly&quot; was part of the motivation for Michigan Attorney General Jennifer Granholm and Illinois Lieutenant Governor Corinne Wood to speak out against the hybrid magazine-catalog. The campaign was joined by parents and Christian conservative groups, and Abercrombie removed it from shelves in 2003.

In November 2001, the Oxford Union debating society invited Jameson to come to Oxford to argue against the proposition &quot;The House Believes that Porn is Harmful.&quot; She wrote in her diary at the time, &quot;I feel like I am going to be out of my element, but, I could never pass this chance up ... it&#x27;s a once in a lifetime thing.&quot; In the end, her side won the debate 204 to 27.

In February 2003, Pony International planned to feature her as one of several pornographic actors in advertisements for athletic shoes. This was attacked by Bill O&#x27;Reilly of Fox News in an editorial called &quot;Using Quasi-Prostitutes to Sell Sneakers&quot;, calling pornographic actors inappropriate role models for teens. In response, &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; proposed a boycott of O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News. Jameson herself sent a sarcastic email to the show, writing:

==Personal life==

In 2004 Jameson stated that she was bisexual, and that she had had sex with 100 women and 30 men off-screen in her life, but by 2008 she described herself as &quot;totally hetero&quot;. She has stated the best relationship she ever had was her lesbian relationship with porn actress Nikki Tyler, which she documents in her autobiography. They lived together at the start of her porn career and again before her second marriage. Famous boyfriends discussed in her autobiography include Marilyn Manson and Tommy Lee.

On December 20, 1996, Jameson married porn star/Wicked Pictures director Brad Armstrong. The marriage lasted just 10 weeks. Although they informally separated in March 1997, she remained contractually obligated to work on Wicked Pictures projects involving both of them. They legally separated and divorced in March 2001.

Jameson met former pornographic studio owner Jay Grdina, scion of a wealthy cattle-ranching family, who had entered pornographic film production after college. From 1998 until Jameson&#x27;s retirement, Grdina was Jameson&#x27;s only on-screen male sex partner, acting under the name Justin Sterling. They were engaged in December 2000, well before her divorce from Armstrong, and married June 22, 2003. They tried to have children from mid-2004 onwards, as Jameson had planned to retire from adult entertainment upon becoming a mother. The couple resided in Scottsdale, Arizona, in a Spanish-style mansion, bought for $2 million in 2002.

In October 2006, it was reported that Jameson began dating mixed martial artist and former UFC champion Tito Ortiz, whom she met on Myspace. On December 12, 2006, Jameson filed for divorce from Grdina.

Jameson announced in August 2008 that she and Ortiz were expecting twins in April 2009. On March 16, 2009, Jameson gave birth to twin boys. Jameson and Ortiz split up in March 2013. Ortiz was granted full custody of the twins.

Jameson&#x27;s father died on October 2, 2010, after suffering complications from triple bypass surgery.

On May 25, 2012, Jameson was arrested in Westminster, California and charged with three misdemeanor counts for driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, driving with a blood-alcohol level over the state legal limit, and driving on a suspended license after her Range Rover struck a light pole. She initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but later changed her plea to guilty. She was sentenced to three years of informal probation, ordered to pay $340 in fines, and participate in a Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact panel. The charge for driving without a valid license was dismissed.

As of 2014, Jameson had undergone extensive tattooing, almost completely covering both of her arms in sleeve tattoos.

In June 2015, Jameson announced that she was converting to Judaism, in order to marry her boyfriend, Lior Bitton. In October of that year, Israel&#x27;s Channel 2 announced a reality television series documenting Jameson&#x27;s conversion.

On August 5, 2016, Jameson announced that she and Bitton were expecting their first child together. On April 6, 2017, they welcomed a daughter, whom they named Batel.

On January 12, 2022, Jameson announced that she was suffering from Guillain–Barré syndrome, although this was later proven to be a misdiagnosis.

On February 1, 2023, Jameson confirmed in a TikTok video that she and Bitton had ended their relationship, and was in a relationship with barber and influencer Jessi Lawless. She married Lawless on May 23, 2023.

On April 17, 2024, Jameson&#x27;s wife Jessi Lawless filed for annulment of their marriage after less than a year. Lawless posted a video on her Instagram explaining that &quot;the 50-year-old former adult film star&#x27;s alleged drinking led to her decision to end the marriage.&quot;

<doc id="74575" wikidata="Q28330" url="?curid=74575" title="List of cities in Israel">
<text>This article lists the 73 localities in Israel that the Israeli Ministry of Interior has designated as a city council. It excludes the 4 Israeli settlements in the West Bank designated as cities, but occupied East Jerusalem is included within Jerusalem.

The list is based on the current index of the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Within Israel&#x27;s system of local government, an urban municipality can be granted a city council by the Interior Ministry when its population exceeds 20,000. The term &quot;city&quot; does not generally refer to local councils or urban agglomerations, even though a defined city often contains only a small portion of an urban area or metropolitan area&#x27;s population.

== List ==

Israel has 16 cities with populations over 100,000, including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv-Yafo. In all, there are 77 Israeli localities granted &quot;municipalities&quot; (or &quot;city&quot;) status by the Ministry of the Interior, including four Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Two more cities are planned: Kasif, a planned city to be built in the Negev, and Harish, originally a small town currently being built into a large city. The area and population of Jerusalem includes that of East Jerusalem which has been &quot;de facto&quot; annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem&#x27;s municipal borders under the Jerusalem Law. This, however, is not recognized by the international community who regard East Jerusalem to be Palestinian territory held under Israeli occupation. If East Jerusalem is considered part of Israel, Tel Aviv is the country&#x27;s second most populous city with 452,000 residents after Jerusalem with 919,000; if not, Tel Aviv is the most populous city before West Jerusalem with around 350,000.

<text>The Israeli system of government is based on parliamentary democracy. The Prime Minister of Israel is the head of government and leader of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government (also known as the cabinet). Legislative power is vested in the Knesset. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The political system of the State of Israel and its main principles are set out in 11 Basic Laws. Israel does not have a written constitution.

==Presidency==
The President of the State is the &quot;de jure&quot; head of state of Israel. The position is largely an apolitical and ceremonial role, and is not considered a part of any Government Branch. The President&#x27;s ceremonial roles include signing every law (except those pertaining to the President&#x27;s powers) and international or bilateral treaty, ceremonially appointing the Prime Minister, confirming and endorsing the credentials of ambassadors, and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats. The President also has several important functions in government. The President is the only government official with the power to pardon or commute prisoners. The President appoints the governor of the Bank of Israel, the president of the national emergency relief service Magen David Adom, and the members and leaders of several institutions. The President also ceremonially appoints judges to their posts after their selection.

==Executive branch==

The Prime Minister is the most powerful political figure in the country. Under sections 7 to 14 of Basic Law: The Government, the Prime Minister is nominated by the President after consulting party leaders in the Knesset; the appointment of the Prime Minister and cabinet is in turn confirmed by a majority vote of confidence from the assembled Knesset members. As head of government, the Prime Minister makes foreign and domestic policy decisions which are voted on by the cabinet. The cabinet is composed of ministers, most of whom are the heads of government departments, though some are deputy ministers and ministers without portfolio. Cabinet ministers are appointed by the Prime Minister. The cabinet&#x27;s composition must also be approved by the Knesset. The Prime Minister may dismiss cabinet members, but any replacements must be approved by the Knesset. Most ministers are members of the Knesset, though only the Prime Minister is required to be one. The cabinet meets weekly on Sundays, and there may be additional meetings if circumstances require it. Each cabinet meeting is chaired by the Prime Minister.

A select group of ministers led by the Prime Minister forms the security cabinet, responsible for outlining and implementing a foreign and defense policy. This forum is designed to coordinate diplomatic negotiations, and to make quick and effective decisions in times of crisis and war.

The Israeli government has 28 ministries, each of them responsible for a sector of public administration. Many ministries are located in the Kiryat Ben Gurion Government complex in the area of Givat Ram in Jerusalem. Each ministry is led by a minister, who is also a member of the cabinet and is usually a member of the Knesset. The Office of the Prime Minister coordinates the work of all government ministries, and assists the Prime Minister in their daily tasks.

The State Comptroller, who supervises and reviews the policies and operations of the government, is elected by the Knesset in secret ballot. They can only be removed from office by a two-thirds vote in the Knesset. In addition to their fiscal and operational oversight function, the State Comptroller also serves as a national ombudsman for the state, receiving complaints from the public about the actions of public officials and institutions.

==Legislative branch==

=== Knesset ===

The Knesset is Israel&#x27;s unicameral legislature and is seated in Jerusalem. Its 120 members are elected to 4-year terms through party-list proportional representation (&quot;see&quot; electoral system, below), as mandated by the 1958 Basic Law: The Knesset. Knesset seats are allocated among parties using the D&#x27;Hondt method of party list proportional representation. Parties select candidates using a closed list. Thus, voters select the party of their choice, rather than any specific candidate. Israel requires a party to meet an election threshold of 3.25% to be allocated a Knesset seat. All Israeli citizens 18 years of age and older may participate in legislative elections, which are conducted by secret ballot.

As the legislative branch of the Israeli government, the Knesset has the power to enact and repeal all laws. It enjoys &quot;de jure&quot; parliamentary supremacy, and can pass any law by a simple majority, even one that might arguably conflict with a Basic Law, unless it has specific conditions for its modification. The Knesset can adopt and amend Basic Laws acting through its capacity as a Constituent Assembly. The Knesset also supervises government activities through its committees, nominates the Prime Minister and approves the cabinet, and elects the President of the State and the State Comptroller. It also has the power to remove the President and State Comptroller from office, revoke the immunity of its members, and to dissolve itself and call new elections.

The February 2009 elections produced five prominent political parties; Kadima, Likud, Israel Beytenu, Labor and Shas, each with more than ten seats in the Knesset. Three of these parties were ruling parties in the past. However, only once has a single party held the 61 seats needed for a majority government (the Alignment from 1968 until the 1969 elections). Therefore, aside from that one exception, since 1948 Israeli governments have always comprised coalitions. As of 2009, there are 12 political parties represented in the Knesset, spanning both the political and religious spectra.

===Electoral system===

Israel&#x27;s electoral system operates within the parameters of a Basic Law (&quot;The Knesset&quot;) and of the 1969 &quot;Knesset Elections Law&quot;.

The Knesset&#x27;s 120 members are elected by secret ballot to 4-year terms, although the Knesset may decide to call for new elections before the end of the 4-year term, and a government can change without a general election; since the 1988 election, no Knesset has finished its 4-year term. In addition a motion of no confidence may be called. Voting in general elections takes place using the highest averages method of party-list proportional representation, using the d&#x27;Hondt formula.

General elections use closed lists: voters vote only for party lists and cannot affect the order of candidates within the lists. Since the 1992 &quot;Parties Law&quot;, only registered parties may stand. There are no separate electoral districts; all voters vote on the same party lists. Suffrage is universal among Israeli citizens aged 18 years or older. Voting is optional. Polling locations are open throughout Israel; absentee ballots are limited to diplomatic staff and the merchant marine. While each party attains one seat for 1 in 120 votes, there is a minimum threshold of 3.25% for parties to attain their first seat in an election. This requirement aimed to bar smaller parties from parliament but spurred some parties to join together simply to overcome the threshold. The low vote-threshold for entry into parliament, as well as the need for parties with small numbers of seats to form coalition governments, results in a highly fragmented political spectrum, with small parties exercising extensive power (relative to their electoral support) within coalitions.

The president selects the prime minister as the party leader most able to form a government, based on the number of parliament seats their coalition has won. After the president&#x27;s selection, the prime minister has forty-five days to form a government. The Knesset collectively must approve the members of the cabinet. This electoral system, inherited from the Yishuv (Jewish settlement organization during the British Mandate), makes it very difficult for any party to gain a working majority in the Knesset and thus governments generally form on the basis of coalitions. Due to the difficulties in holding coalitions together, elections often occur earlier than scheduled. The average life-span of an Israeli government is about two years. Over the years, the peace process, the role of religion in the state, and political scandals have caused coalitions to break apart or have produced early elections.

==Judicial system==

The judicial branch is an independent branch of the government, including secular and religious courts for the various religions present in Israel. The court system involves three stages of justice.

Judges for all courts are appointed by the Judicial Selection Committee. The committee is composed of nine members: two cabinet members (one being the Minister of Justice), two Knesset members, two members of the Israel Bar Association, and three Supreme Court justices (one being the President of the Supreme Court). The committee is chaired by the Minister of Justice.

In November 1985, the Israeli government informed the United Nations Secretariat that it would no longer accept compulsory International Court of Justice jurisdiction.

===Judicial courts===
Israeli judicial courts consist of a three-tier system:
*Magistrate Courts serve as the court of first instance
*District Courts serve as the appellate courts and the court of first instance for some cases;
*The Supreme Court acts as both a court of first instance in matters concerning the legality of decisions of state authorities, and as a supreme appellate court.

===Religious courts===
Some issues of family law (marriage and divorce in particular) fall either under the jurisdiction of religious courts or under parallel jurisdiction of those and the state&#x27;s family courts. The state maintains and finances Rabbinical, Sharia and various Canonical courts for the needs of the various religious communities. All judges are civil servants, and required to uphold general law in their tribunals as well. The Supreme Court serves as final appellate instance for all religious courts.

Jewish religious courts are under control of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and the Chief Rabbinate of Israel. These courts have jurisdiction in only five areas: Kashrut, Sabbath, Jewish burial, marital issues (especially divorce), and Jewish status of immigrants. However, except for determining a person&#x27;s marital status, all other marital issues may also be taken to secular Family Courts.

The other major religious communities in Israel, such as Muslims and Christians, have their own religious courts. These courts have similar jurisdiction over their followers as Jewish religious courts, although Muslim religious courts have more control over family affairs.

===Labor courts===

There are five regional labor courts in Israel as a tribunal of first instance, and a National Labor Court in Jerusalem to hear appeals and few cases of national importance. The labor courts have exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving employer-employee relationship, employment, strikes and labor union disputes, labor-related complaints against the National Insurance Institute, and Health Insurance claims.

===Military courts===

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) maintains a series of district military courts and special military tribunals. The Military Court of Appeals is the IDF&#x27;s supreme appellate court. It considers and judges over appeals submitted by the Military Advocate General, which challenges decisions rendered by the lower courts.

===Court of Admiralty===
In all matters having to do with admiralty, commercial shipping, accidents at sea, and other maritime matters, the Haifa District Court, sitting as the Court of Admiralty, has exclusive statewide jurisdiction.

==Separation of powers==
The Basic Law: The Government contains a number of checks and balances between the Knesset and the Government.

The fact that the Government holds office by virtue of the confidence of the Knesset creates a significant check on the Government&#x27;s power, but there are also restrictions on the Knesset&#x27;s ability to vote no confidence in the Government. The Government serves with the confidence of the Knesset, but the Knesset is limited to a constructive vote of no confidence under Basic Law: The Government (2001). Members of the Knesset are also disincentivized from supporting a vote of no confidence for the purpose of obtaining a ministerial portfolio in a subsequent government, as when members of Knesset (MKs) defect from their faction—which is defined as opposing one’s party’s position on a vote of confidence—they are ineligible to serve as ministers during that Knesset, and they cannot run on their party’s list in the subsequent election.

Additionally, the Knesset can exercise oversight over the Government. Knesset committees can compel testimony of government ministers, and the Government is required to comply with such oversight requests. The Basic Laws also reserve a role for the Knesset minority, with 40 MKs empowered to compel the Prime Minister’s attendance in the Knesset on a set topic. The Basic Laws contemplate a regularized system of oversight, with any reorganization of ministerial powers requiring Knesset approval and the creation of a committee in the Knesset to oversee the ministry. This requirement supports the Knesset’s oversight of ministerial regulations. When government ministers issue regulations that involve criminal sanctions for violations, the Knesset committee that oversees that committee has the ability to invalidate that regulation within 45 days. The Israeli Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of such oversight mechanisms, in some cases requiring the government avoid taking action, including during a state of emergency, unless and until the Knesset can properly exercise oversight of it through its committees.

==Local government==
For governmental purposes, Israel is divided into six districts: Central District; Haifa District; Jerusalem District; Northern District; Southern District; and Tel Aviv District. The districts further subdivide into fifteen sub-districts and into fifty natural regions. Administration of the districts is coordinated by the Ministry of Interior.

There are three forms of local government in Israel: city councils, local councils, and regional councils. City councils govern municipalities classified as cities, local councils govern small municipalities, and regional councils govern groups of communities. These bodies look after public services such as urban planning, zoning, the provision of water, emergency services, and education and culture, as per guidelines of the Ministry of Interior. Local governments consist of a governing council chaired by a mayor. The mayor and all council members are chosen in municipal elections.

The Ministry of Defense has responsibility for the administration of the occupied territories.

<text>Rear Window is a 1954 American mystery thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and written by John Michael Hayes, based on Cornell Woolrich&#x27;s 1942 short story &quot;It Had to Be Murder&quot;. Originally released by Paramount Pictures, the film stars James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Wendell Corey, Thelma Ritter, and Raymond Burr. It was screened at the 1954 Venice Film Festival in competition for the Golden Lion.

&quot;Rear Window&quot; is considered by many filmgoers, critics, and scholars to be one of Hitchcock&#x27;s best films, as well as one of the greatest films ever made. It received four Academy Award nominations, and was ranked number 42 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies list and number 48 on the 10th-anniversary edition, and in 1997 was added to the United States National Film Registry in the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

The film was made with a budget of $1 million , and grossed $27 million during its initial release .

== Plot ==
Professional photojournalist and fashion photographer L.B. &quot;Jeff&quot; Jefferies, recuperating from serious injuries from his waist to his foot, is restricted to a wheelchair in his Greenwich Village apartment. His mid-floor rear window looks out onto a courtyard with small garden plots and other apartments in the surrounding blocks. Jeff is regularly visited by Stella, a cynical, middle-aged nurse, and his idealistic young girlfriend Lisa Fremont, a model and socialite.

During an intense heat wave, Jeff watches his neighbors through their open windows, including a professional dancer coined &quot;Miss Torso&quot;, a songwriter with writer&#x27;s block, and traveling costume jewelry salesman Lars Thorwald, who is hen-pecked by his bedridden wife. One night, Jeff hears a woman scream followed by the sound of breaking glass. Later that night, Jeff wakes as a thunderstorm breaks. He observes Thorwald making repeated half-hour excursions outside carrying his aluminum sample case. Later still, Thorwald is seen leaving his apartment along with a woman obscured by a large black hat.

The next morning, Jeff notices Thorwald&#x27;s wife is gone, and sees him cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Thorwald also has movers haul away a large trunk. After digging out his binoculars and then a camera with a high-power telephoto lens, a suspicious Jeff starts closely observing Thorwald&#x27;s activities. He becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife, and tells first Stella, who becomes morbidly interested in the case, and then Lisa, who doubts him until they notice that Thorwald&#x27;s wife is no longer in bed and the mattress is rolled up.

Jeff calls detective Tom Doyle and requests that he investigate Thorwald. A very skeptical Doyle investigates extensively and finds nothing suspicious, offering that Thorwald had sent his wife on a vacation upstate. Jeff and Lisa are at first convinced by this story and question their &quot;rear window ethics&quot;. Later that night, however, the dog belonging to the neighbor one floor up from the Thorwalds is found dead in the courtyard. The dog&#x27;s alarmed owner yells, drawing the attention of everyone except Thorwald, who sits silently in his dark apartment. Now convinced his theory is true, Jeff has Lisa pull out some slides taken two weeks earlier and notices that Thorwald had dug up his garden in the interim, possibly to bury his wife&#x27;s body.

The following night, Jeff telephones and lures Thorwald away from his apartment to allow Lisa and Stella to investigate Thorwald&#x27;s flower bed where the dog had been digging. Nothing is found, but Lisa climbs into Thorwald&#x27;s apartment and searches it. Stella hurries back to Jeff. 

Below Thorwald&#x27;s apartment, Jeff and Stella are distracted watching a lower ground floor neighborcoined &quot;Miss Lonely-Hearts&quot;contemplating an overdose, and they call the police. The songwriter has finally finished his song &quot;Lisa&quot; and plays it loudly, causing Miss Lonely-Hearts to not go through with her suicide attempt. As they wait, Thorwald unexpectedly returns early and catches Lisa on his property. The police intervene as the pair scuffles. During their questioning, Lisa signals to Jeff that she is wearing Mrs. Thorwald&#x27;s wedding ring. Thorwald sees this and realizes Jeff is surveilling his apartment. 

Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message while Stella goes to bail Lisa out of jail. Thorwald locates and attacks Jeff in his darkened apartment, his only defense being camera flash bulbs. While grappling, Doyle and other officers storm the courtyardfollowed by Lisa and Stellaand arrest Thorwald just as he drops Jeff out of his window. Thorwald confesses to his wife&#x27;s murder to the police.

A few days later, the heat wave has broken and life in the apartment complex has returned to normal. Miss Lonely-Hearts is seen in a semi-romantic position with the songwriter in his studio apartment. Jeff, having broken his other leg in the fall, is still wheelchair-bound, now with casts on both legs. Lisa is seen stretched out next to him, wearing a much more casual outfit and reading a travel book. After noticing Jeff asleep, she puts down the book on exploration titled &quot;Beyond the High Himalayas&quot; and turns instead to read &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

== Themes ==
===Analysis===
&quot;Rear Window&quot; is filmed almost entirely within Jeff&#x27;s apartment and from his near-static point-of-view at his window. In Laura Mulvey&#x27;s essay &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,&quot; she identifies what she sees as voyeurism and scopophilia in Hitchcock&#x27;s movies, with &quot;Rear Window&quot; used as a prime example of how she sees cinema as incorporating the patriarchy into the way that pleasure is constructed and signaled to the audience. Additionally, she sees the &quot;male gaze&quot; as especially evident in &quot;Rear Window&quot; in the portrayal of characters such as the dancer &quot;Miss Torso&quot;, who is a spectacle for both Jeff and the audience (through his substitution) to enjoy.

In his 1954 review of the film, François Truffaut suggested &quot;this parable: The courtyard is the world, the reporter/photographer is the filmmaker, the binoculars stand for the camera and its lenses.&quot;

=== Voyeurism ===
John Fawell notes in Dennis Perry&#x27;s book &quot;Hitchcock and Poe: The Legacy of Delight and Terror&quot; that Hitchcock &quot;recognized that the darkest aspect of voyeurism ... is our desire for awful things to happen to people ... to make ourselves feel better, and to relieve ourselves of the burden of examining our own lives.&quot; Hitchcock challenges the audience, forcing them to peer through his rear window and become exposed to, as Donald Spoto calls it in his 1976 book &quot;The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures&quot;, the &quot;social contagion&quot; of acting as voyeur.

In his book &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot;, John Belton further addresses the underlying issues of voyeurism which he asserts are evident in the film. He says &quot;Rear Window&#x27;s&quot; story is &#x27;about&#x27; spectacle; it explores the fascination with looking and the attraction of that which is being looked at.&quot;

In an explicit example of a condemnation of voyeurism, Stella expresses her outrage at Jeffries&#x27; voyeuristic habits, saying, &quot;In the old days, they&#x27;d put your eyes out with a red hot poker&quot; and &quot;What people ought to do is get outside and look in for a change.&quot;

With further analysis, Jeff&#x27;s positive evolution understandably would be impossible without voyeurism—or as Robin Wood puts it in his 1989 book &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s Films Revisited&quot;, &quot;the indulging of morbid curiosity and the consequences of that indulgence.&quot;

== Production ==
===Writing===
The screenplay, which was written by John Michael Hayes, was based on Cornell Woolrich&#x27;s 1942 short story &quot;It Had to Be Murder&quot;. However, in 1990 the question as to who owned the film rights of Woolrich&#x27;s original story went before the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Stewart v. Abend&quot;. Although the film was copyrighted in 1954 by Patron Inc. by a production company set up by Hitchcock and Stewart, a subsequent rights holder refused to acknowledge previous rights agreements. As a result, Stewart and Hitchcock&#x27;s estate became involved in the Supreme Court case. Its outcome led to the litigant, Sheldon Abend, becoming credited as a producer of the 1998 remake of &quot;Rear Window&quot;.

===Filming===
The film was shot entirely at stage 17 at Paramount Studios which included an enormous indoor set to replicate a Greenwich Village courtyard, with the set stretching from the bottom of the basement storeroom to the top of the lighting grid in the ceiling. The lighting was rigged with four interchangeable scene lighting arrangements: morning, afternoon, evening, and night-time. Set designers Hal Pereira and Joseph MacMillan Johnson spent six weeks building the extremely detailed and complex set, which ended up being the largest of its kind at Paramount. One of the unique features of the set was its massive drainage system, constructed to accommodate the rain sequence in the film. They also built the set around a highly nuanced lighting system which was able to create natural-looking lighting effects for both the day and night scenes. Though the address given in the film is 125 W. Ninth Street in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, the set was actually based on a real courtyard located at 125 Christopher Street.

In addition to the meticulous care and detail put into the set, careful attention was also given to sound, including the use of natural sounds and music that would drift across the courtyard and into Jefferies&#x27; apartment. At one point, the voice of Bing Crosby can be heard singing &quot;To See You Is to Love You,&quot; originally from the 1952 Paramount film &quot;Road to Bali&quot;. Also heard on the soundtrack are versions of songs popularized earlier in the decade by Nat King Cole (&quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, 1950) and Dean Martin (&quot;That&#x27;s Amore&quot;, 1952), along with segments from Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s score for Jerome Robbins&#x27; ballet &quot;Fancy Free&quot; (1944), Richard Rodgers&#x27;s song &quot;Lover&quot; (1932), and &quot;M&#x27;appari tutt&#x27;amor&quot; from Friedrich von Flotow&#x27;s opera &quot;Martha&quot; (1844), most borrowed from Paramount&#x27;s music publisher, Famous Music.

Hitchcock used costume designer Edith Head on all of his Paramount films.

==Soundtrack==
Although veteran Hollywood composer Franz Waxman is credited with the score for the film, his contributions were limited to the opening and closing titles and the songwriter&#x27;s piano tune (&quot;Lisa&quot;). This was Waxman&#x27;s final score for Hitchcock. The director instead used primarily diegetic music and sounds throughout the film.

== Release ==

On August 4, 1954, a &quot;benefit world premiere&quot; was held for the film, with United Nations officials and &quot;prominent members of the social and entertainment worlds&quot; at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City, with proceeds going to the American–Korean Foundation (an aid organization founded soon after the end of the Korean War and headed by Milton S. Eisenhower, brother of President Eisenhower).

During its initial theatrical run, &quot;Rear Window&quot; earned $5.3 million in North American box office rentals.

==Reception==

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film a &quot;tense and exciting exercise&quot; and deemed Hitchcock as a director whose work has a &quot;maximum of build-up to the punch, a maximum of carefully tricked deception and incidents to divert and amuse.&quot; Crowther also noted that &quot;Mr. Hitchcock&#x27;s film is not &#x27;significant.&#x27; What it has to say about people and human nature is superficial and glib, but it does expose many facets of the loneliness of city life, and it tacitly demonstrates the impulse of morbid curiosity. The purpose of it is sensation, and that it generally provides in the colorfulness of its detail and in the flood of menace toward the end.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;one of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s better thrillers&quot; which &quot;combines technical and artistic skills in a manner that makes this an unusually good piece of murder mystery entertainment.&quot; The film ranked fifth on &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;&#x27;s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1955.

&quot;Time&quot; called it &quot;just possibly the second-most entertaining picture (after &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;) ever made by Alfred Hitchcock&quot; and a film in which there is &quot;never an instant ... when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material.&quot; The reviewer also noted the &quot;occasional studied lapses of taste and, more important, the eerie sense a Hitchcock audience has of reacting in a manner so carefully foreseen as to seem practically foreordained.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; named the film as a &quot;first-rate thriller&quot; that is &quot;strictly an adult entertainment, but it should prove to be a popular one.&quot; They further added, &quot;What helps to make the story highly entertaining is the fact that it is enhanced by clever dialogue and by delightful touches of comedy and romance that relieve the tension.&quot;

Nearly 30 years after the film&#x27;s initial release, Roger Ebert reviewed the re-release by Universal Pictures in October 1983, after Hitchcock&#x27;s estate was settled. He said the film &quot;develops such a clean, uncluttered line from beginning to end that we&#x27;re drawn through it (and into it) effortlessly. The experience is not so much like watching a movie, as like ... well, like spying on your neighbors. Hitchcock traps us right from the first ... And because Hitchcock makes us accomplices in Stewart&#x27;s voyeurism, we&#x27;re along for the ride. When an enraged man comes bursting through the door to kill Stewart, we can&#x27;t detach ourselves, because we looked too, and so we share the guilt and in a way we deserve what&#x27;s coming to him.&quot; In 1983, reviewing the film Vincent Canby wrote &quot;Its appeal, which goes beyond that of other, equally masterly Hitchcock works, remains undiminished.&quot;

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 98% based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 9.30/10. The critics&#x27; consensus states that &quot;Hitchcock exerted full potential of suspense in this masterpiece.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of a very rare perfect 100 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In his 2012 review of the film, Killian Fox of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;Hitchcock made a career out of indulging our voyeuristic tendencies, and he never excited them more skilfully, or with more gleeful self-awareness, than in &quot;Rear Window&quot;&quot;.

== Awards and nominations ==
== Legacy ==
In 1997, &quot;Rear Window&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. By this time, the film interested other directors with its theme of voyeurism, and other reworkings of the film soon followed, which included Brian De Palma&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Body Double&quot; and Phillip Noyce&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;Sliver&quot;. In 1998 &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine conducted a poll and &quot;Rear Window&quot; was voted the 21st greatest film of all time. In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, &quot;Rear Window&quot; was ranked 53rd among critics and 48th among directors. In the 2022 edition of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Greatest films of all time&quot; list the film ranked 38th in the critics poll. In 2017 &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s readers&#x27; poll ranked &quot;Rear Window&quot; at No. 72 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked the film at No. 26 on their list of &quot;The 100 best thriller films of all time&quot;.

&quot;Rear Window&quot; was restored by the team of Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz for its 1999 limited theatrical re-release (using Technicolor dye-transfer prints for the first time in this title&#x27;s history) and the Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD release in 2000.

American Film Institute included the film as number 42 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies, number 14 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills, number 48 in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) and number three in AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 (Mysteries).

&quot;Rear Window&quot; was remade as a TV movie of the same name in 1998, with an updated storyline in which the lead character is paralyzed and lives in a high-tech home filled with assistive technology. Actor Christopher Reeve, himself paralyzed as a result of a 1995 horse-riding accident, was cast in the lead role. The telefilm also starred Daryl Hannah, Robert Forster, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and Anne Twomey.

&quot;Rear Window&quot; has directly influenced plot elements and themes of numerous Brian De Palma films, particularly &quot;Hi, Mom!&quot; (1970), &quot;Sisters&quot; (1972), &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot; (1980), and &quot;Body Double&quot; (1984).

&quot;Disturbia&quot; (2007) is a modern-day retelling, with the protagonist (Shia LaBeouf) under house arrest instead of laid up with a broken leg, and who believes that his neighbor is a serial killer rather than having committed a single murder. On September 5, 2008, the Sheldon Abend Trust sued Steven Spielberg, DreamWorks, Viacom, and Universal Studios, alleging that the producers of &quot;Disturbia&quot; violated the copyright to the original Woolrich story owned by Abend. On September 21, 2010, the U.S. District Court in &quot;Abend v. Spielberg&quot;, 748 F.Supp.2d 200 (S.D.N.Y. 2010), ruled that &quot;Disturbia&quot; did not infringe the original Woolrich story.

The 2004 horror film &quot;Saw&quot; pays homage to &quot;Rear Window&quot;, in a particular scene involving the character Adam Stanheight (Leigh Whannell). In the film, Adam is kidnapped and uses a camera to take photos with his camera to illuminate the dark surroundings, mirroring the actions of Jeff in &quot;Rear Window&quot;, with both scenes sharing a similar tone.

&quot;Rear Window&quot; has been homaged and spoofed in numerous episodes of television, including the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart of Darkness&quot;, the &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; episode &quot;How the &#x27;A&#x27; Stole Christmas&quot;, season four episode seven of &quot;9-1-1&quot; and &quot;Night Terrors&quot;&quot;,&quot; the second episode &quot;of&quot; season 2 of the British crime drama &quot;Whitstable Pearl&quot;.

In February 2008, the film was referenced as a part of Variety&#x27;s &quot;The 2008 Hollywood Portfolio: Hitchcock Classics&quot; spread, with Scarlett Johansson and Javier Bardem as Lisa and Jeff, respectively.

&quot;Rear Window&quot; has been referenced multiple times by singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. In the music video for her single &quot;Me!&quot;, Swift wears a dress similar to one of Edith Head&#x27;s designs worn by Grace Kelly. Swift has also stated that the voyeuristic elements of the film inspired the storytelling of her album &quot;Folklore.&quot;

On September 25, 2012, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released &quot;Rear Window&quot; for the first time on Blu-ray as part of the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection&quot;. This edition included numerous supplemental features such as an audio commentary from John Fawell, excerpts from Hitchcock&#x27;s interview with François Truffaut, two theatrical trailers, and an interview with the film&#x27;s screenwriter John Michael Hayes.

On May 6, 2014, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment re-released &quot;Rear Window&quot; on Blu-ray with the same supplemental features.

<text>Telecommunications in Israel are the most developed in the Middle East. Israel&#x27;s system consists of coaxial cables, optical fibers, and microwave radio relay. Prior to the 1990s, Israel&#x27;s telecommunication market was dominated by Bezeq, a government-owned corporation. During the 1990s, the Israeli telecommunication industry transitioned from government owned monopolies to diversified private competition by a range of new companies. As of 2014, the telecommunications sector in Israel had revenues over ₪15 billion, representing about 2% of the GDP.

Technology and industry-wise, the Israeli telecom industry has been among global leaders in technology development pioneering developments of protocols such as WiMAX, VoIP and TDMoIP. During the 2000s Israel emerged as a leading supplier for the global telecommunications industry, and a global leader in technological research.

==1940s–1960s==

* 1939 – Yedioth Ahronoth is founded – the national newspaper of Israel.
* 1948 – The Israeli Postal Service (Ministry of Transport, Postal, Telegraph and Radio) replaced the mail service system provided during the British Mandate of Palestine.
* 1948 – Maariv is founded – Daily newspaper
* 1955 – Israel&#x27;s first mobile post office began in the Negev.
* 1966 – The Israeli Educational Television began broadcasting on 24 March.
* 1968 – The public broadcasting channel Channel 1 (then called &quot;The Israeli Television&quot;) started broadcasting with a live broadcast of an army parade on the Israeli Independence Day in Jerusalem.

==1970s–1980s==

* The Voice of Peace ( – Kol Hashalom) was a radio station that served Israel and the Middle East for 20 years. The station first went on the air in May 1973 from the ship &quot;MV Peace&quot; (formerly the Dutch cargo vessel &quot;MV Cito&quot;).

The 1980s brought a revolution to the communication market in Israel:
* In 1984, Bezeq was established to reduce bureaucracy and improve efficiency, significantly reducing the waiting period for the installation of new telephone lines.
* In 1986, the Israel Postal Authority was founded.
* In 1986, Pelephone (the first cellular company in Israel) was established by Motorola and Tadiran.
* In October 1986, the Israeli Channel 2 started experimental broadcasts which continued for a period of seven years.
* Arutz Sheva ( – Channel 7) was a radio station that served Israel for 15 years. The station first went on the air on 21 October 1988 from the ship &quot;MV Eretz HaTzvi&quot; (formerly the Maltese cargo vessel &quot;MV Mount Parnis&quot;).
* Pirate cable TV arrived towards the end of the eighties.

==1990s==
The 1990s was a decade of marked change in the Israeli telecommunications industry, and massive developments in cellular communications, Internet, commercial television, and multichannel television platform such as cable television and satellite television.
* The Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority was established and the first Israeli commercial channel – Channel 2 – began to broadcast on 4 November 1993, which began the era of television ratings in Israel. The original agreement was that the broadcasting days of the channel were distributed among three broadcasting companies in order not to have a direct competition between them.
* The multichannel television platform in Israel began when the cable TV companies were established. Every company had a monopoly in a certain area of the country (according to a franchise given by the Ministry of Communications). For the first time, the Israeli public became exposed to tens of foreign channels from other countries around the world (which overtook the place of the Jordanian and Lebanese channels which were the only foreign channels received in Israel until then), and to new local channels on the cables: The children channel, the sports channel, the family channel, and the films channel. The move brought to almost total elimination of the pirated cable broadcasting in the country.
* The Israeli pirate radios experienced prosperity which happened in tandem with the establishment of legal regional radio stations, and to the reorganization of the military radio stations in 1993 (the establishment of Galgalatz in tandem with the Israel Defense Forces Radio, instead of the former two stations &quot;Army 1&quot; and &quot;Army 2&quot;). In spite of all the changes in the field of radio broadcasting, this medium lost the majority of the listeners ratings during the nineties, and by the end of the decade, the radio was considered to be a communication medium which had few listeners in relatively to the television.
* Although the majority of homes in Israel still receive daily newspapers nowadays, in this decade many main newspapers were closed, including &quot;Hadashot&quot;, &quot;Al HaMishmar&quot;, and &quot;Davar&quot;.
* In the mid-nineties, Internet and emailing became prevalent in Israel. Back then, the connection to the Internet had to be done by means of dial-up Internet access to the local Internet service providers such as NetVision and Internet Gold.
* In 1994, Cellcom joined as the second cellular network in Israel after Pelephone. At the start, the company experienced different problems with the devices they provided, when their users experienced many disconnections and intermittence during conversations.
* In 1998, Bezeq&#x27;s monopoly on international calling services was ended with the addition of two other companies, Golden Lines, and Barak, who also began to offer international calling services . The activity of Bezeq in this field passed to its subsidiary Bezeq International.
* In 1999, Partner Communications Company joined the cellular communication market in Israel with the brand-name Orange Israel. Partner was the first company which built network foundations in Israel which worked under GSM technologies.

==2000s==
In the first decade of the 21st century there was a major emphasis on digitization and a shift to mobile technologies, following similar trends in Europe and North America.

===Television===
The Israeli satellite television provider Yes was established in 2000, introducing strong competition in the cable television market. Prior to the establishment of Yes there were only three other cable companies in Israel: Tevel, Matav and Arutzay Zahav. The competition with Yes caused a big loss of members amongst the cable TV companies which urged them to merge. In order to strengthen Yes, which was relatively new, the regulator postponed his approval to the merger of the cable companies. The merger was completed in 2003, and the cable companies were renamed under the singular company called Hot.

Throughout the decade, Hot and Yes inserted the use of the digital set-top boxes, and with them it became possible to receive digital broadcasts (improvement in the quality of reception of the television channels), and additionally also enabled games channels, video on demand (V.O.D) and nowadays they supply digital set-top boxes which contain advanced digital video recorder (DVR) technologies which are capable of pre-recording shows (Hot Magic, Yes Max). HOT has put a big emphasis on encouraging production of local Israeli movies, while YES, in contrast, puts more emphasis on purchasing foreign TV series and movies.

Under the inspection of the Second Israeli Broadcasting Authority, an additional Israeli terrestrial-commercial channel was established on 28 January 2002: Channel 10. This move started a competition among the commercial channels. Channel 10 purchased for itself hosts and actors from Channel 2 and Channel 1. In spite of these procurement actions, the channel is still considered to be inferior in the amount of its viewers relatively to the other channels.

In 2005, an additional bid took place in channel 2, in which &quot;Keshet&quot; and &quot;Reshet&quot; were chosen to be the channel&#x27;s broadcasts to the consequent decade. Israeli News Company won the bid to produce the terrestrial Knesset Channel. On 30 March 2010, all analogue terrestrial television towers were switched off and digital distribution (&quot;Idan Plus&quot;) is the only digital terrestrial system in effect. The first phase includes five SD channels (IBA-1, IBA-33, Channel 2, Israel 10 and The Knesset Channel). The system is DVB-T and MPEG-4 and in SFN configuration with two frequencies across the whole country (north and south are UHF 26 while central is UHF 29). A second phase with more channels was expected in 2012 (also IBA-1 HD) and a third phase maybe in 2013.

===Internet===

Broadband Internet became prevalent in the majority of homes in Israel. Bezeq ceased to be a monopoly in the field of the landline communications, when HOT started offering telephony services through the cables infrastructures.

In the middle of the decade, due to the popularity which the high-speed Internet and VoIP technologies gained amongst the Israelis, at first Israelis were able to conduct international conversations free of charge or at lower rates through the Internet due to the link between VoIP networks such as Skype and Vonage and the traditional telephony networks in Israel and abroad. In 2008, Partner Communications Company and XFONE joined the high-speed Internet providers market.

===Other communication Fields===
On 1 March 2006, The Israel Postal Authority became a government-owned corporation, the Israel Postal Company, as a preceding stage to the opening of the mail market to competition. The Israeli radio succeeded to recover from rating problems and opened more regional radio stations.

On 17 December 2007, the Israeli parliament approved a new law which enables the Israel police and other law enforcement bodies to access communication data without judicial inspection.

On 4 June 2008, the Ministry of Communications published a concession for operating a system which would enable broadcasting of digital radio transmissions in Israel. Over 50 stations nationwide are estimated to be broadcasting their transmissions on the Israeli digital radio broadcasts.

==Present==
===Press===

Israel has three main commercial daily newspapers: &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, &quot;Maariv&quot; and &quot;Haaretz&quot;. Additionally, there are also two large free daily newspapers: &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; and &quot;Israel Post&quot; (belongs to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;). Other major newspapers include the Russian-language &quot;Vesti&quot;, the English-language &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, etc.

===Mail===
The mail field in Israel treads towards competition. The Mail Authority became the Israel Postal Company. Gradually, the government-owned postal company enabled additional companies to enter the market of postal deliveries of mail with a weight up to half a kilogram; this was done so that they could compete with the governmental mail company, allowing the postage rates to drop.

===Radio===
In contrast with the state which exists in the television field, in the radio field, the Israel Broadcasting Authority is allowed to produce earnings from advertising. The radio section of the Israel Broadcasting Authority is called Kol Yisrael (&quot;Voice Of Israel&quot;).

Reshet Bet is the leading radio station in Israel. Two additional radio stations belong to the Israeli defense forces: Israel Defense Forces Radio and Galgalatz. In addition to the main radio stations which could be received throughout the country, there are also regional commercial radio stations broadcasting under the auspices of the Second Authority for Television and Radio. There is a severe problem in Israel with pirated radio stations.

===Landline telephony===

As of 2020, Bezeq, HOT, Partner and Cellcom offer landline telephony services. Bezeq offers traditional services, while the others offer Voice over IP, with Hot&#x27;s service being routed through an intranet.

In 2020, Bezeq had 9,500 payphones throughout the country. In December of the same year, they received permission from the government to dismantle the vast majority of these phones, leaving only those in active use and those within closed spaces, e.g. prisons, where other choices are not available.

===International calls===
As of October 2016, eight operators, 012 – 012 Smile, 013 – 013 NetVision, 014 – Bezeq International, 015 – Hallo 015, 016 – Golan Telecom, 017 – Hot Mobile, 018 – Exphone and 019 – 019 Telzar provide international telephony: All the companies offer membership services which usually offer their customers cheaper rates. Membership might include some benefits such as billing, and dialing the default 00 prefix instead of the need to dial the specific prefix of the company (as it was done in the past, when Bezeq had a monopoly in this field). Because these companies have an extensive infrastructure of links abroad, the majority of them also provide internet services. Incoming calls are distributed through the companies relative to market share.

===Cellular communication===
As of January 2020, There are six major network operators in Israel which offer cellular communication service: Pelephone, Cellcom, Partner, Hot Mobile, Golan Telecom and we4G.

In addition, there are several MVNOs: Rami Levy, Home Cellular, 019 Telzar and Cellact. The services which these companies provide long ago passed the boundaries of voice conversations and currently provide also SMS Text messaging, Videoconferencing and Broadband Internet access.

===Television===
Cable and Satellite Broadcasting Council is a governing-body whose purpose is to facilitate and regulate the commercially operated television broadcasts in Israel. There are two companies in the market of multichannel television: HOT (which provides television services through an underground infrastructure of cables) and yes (which provides television services through satellite transmissions). The cable company has an advantage over the satellite company due to a permit granted to it from the communication office, which enables it to provide full bidirectional communications (for example the ability to provide video on demand services).

There are two commercial channels on Israeli television: Channel 2 and Channel 10. There also exist several niche channels which make their earnings from TV advertisements, such as: Israel Plus, Music 24, Channel 20 and the Israeli shopping channel. Additionally, Channel 1, which belongs to the Israel Broadcasting Authority, finance itself partially with the help of limited sponsorship announcements, although most of its budget comes from the license fees which every household in Israel, with a television and a digital receiver set, pays annually.

===Internet===
The Internet companies market is divided into two categories: infrastructure providers and service providers. The infrastructure providers are Bezeq and Hot. A third company Unlimited is building an internet-over-powerline infrastructure. As of October 2016, the largest Internet service providers are Bezeq International and Hot, in addition to 50 smaller companies.

===International connections===
Three companies operate fiber optic submarine communications cables connecting Israel and Europe:

<doc id="74580" wikidata="Q2369657" url="?curid=74580" title="Transport in Israel">
<text>Transportation in Israel is based mainly on private motor vehicles and bus service and an expanding railway network. A lack of inland waterways and the small size of the country make air and water transport of only minor importance in domestic transportation, but they are vitally important for Israel&#x27;s international transport links. Demands of population growth, political factors, the Israel Defense Forces, tourism and increased traffic set the pace for all sectors, being a major driver in the mobility transition towards railways and public transit while moving away from motorized road transport.
All facets of transportation in Israel are under the supervision of the Ministry of Transport and Road Safety.

==Private transportation==
===Roads===
Israel&#x27;s road network spans of roads, of which are classified as freeways. The network spans the whole country.

Route 6, the Trans Israel Highway, starts just east of Haifa down to the outskirts of Beer Sheva, about . Route 1 between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and Route 2 between Tel Aviv and Haifa are well maintained highways. Route 90 is the longest road in Israel streaching from Metula to Eilat via the Jordan Valley and Arava.

===Cycling===

Tel Aviv has a growing network of bike paths, with more than over 360 kilometers (224 miles) existing or planned. In April 2011, Tel Aviv municipality launched Tel-O-Fun, a bicycle sharing system, in which 150 stations of bicycles for rent were installed within the city limits. Jerusalem has over 125 kilometers (78 miles) of cycleways, either existing or planned. Additionally, Jerusalem also has a bicycle sharing program called Jerufun.

====National Bike Trail====

The National Bike Trail, when completed will take riders from the southern city of Eilat to the border with Lebanon, passing though Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and several other cities.

====Ofnidan (Greater Tel Aviv Cycle Network)====
As of 2021, construction was underway on Ofnidan, a cycle network of seven inter-urban routes connecting the cities of the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area, with some segments already open.

== Public transportation ==
In March 2024, Israel launched a reform intended to encourage use of public transport by decreasing prices. The reform includes a 50% discount to those who live on the periphery and not in places with a high income, to disabled. 33% discount will be given to people in the age of 18-26 so that people get used to move on public transport. Discharged soldiers and those who have completed national service will ride for free during one year. The discount will be given only for a &quot;monthly free&quot; arrangement and not for a ticket for a single trip. As the price of public transport in Israel is relatively low, probably more lines, bus lanes and higher frequency can cause even bigger effect.

=== Bus service ===

Buses are the country&#x27;s main form of public transport. In 2017, bus passenger trips totaled approximately 740 million. In 2009, 16 companies operated buses for public transport, totaling 5,939 buses and 8,470 drivers. Egged is Israel&#x27;s largest bus company, and operates routes throughout the country. Bus routes in some areas are operated by smaller carriers, the largest being the Dan Bus Company, operating routes in Gush Dan. Kavim is the next largest.

Bus stations in Israel, other than standalone bus stops, come in two types: terminals (&quot;masof&quot;, pl. &quot;mesofim&quot;) and central stations (&quot;tahana merkazit&quot;). Each terminal serves a number of routes, usually over a dozen, while a central station may serve over a hundred bus routes. The largest central bus terminal in the country is the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station, which is also the second largest bus terminal in the world.

On August 5, 2010, the Ministry of Transport opened a website that contained information about public bus and train routes in the country. Previously, information was given only by the individual public transit operators.

==== Bus rapid transit ====
Israel has one bus rapid transit system in Haifa, called the Metronit, which consists of three lines connecting Haifa to its suburbs. In addition, there are BRT feeder lines to the Jerusalem Light Rail, running on dedicated bus lanes from Southern Jerusalem to the Northern Jerusalem neighborhood of Ramot crossing the light rail line at the intersection of Jaffa and King George Streets.

=== Share taxis ===
Israel also has a share taxi service (, &quot;sherut&quot;), run by several private companies, depending on location, in addition to regular taxicab services. The shared &quot;sherut&quot; service usually appears a yellow minivans and travel along the same path as the normal buses with identical route numbers. For a slightly higher price, the shared &quot;sherut&quot; service allows passengers to both hop on and hop off anywhere along the path of travel. During peak travel, often the time of travel can be shortened as the number of passengers is significantly small compared to normal bus services. Some routes continue to travel through the night and on Shabbat providing transport needs to the population when normal buses services cease. The beginning and end of the &quot;sherut&quot; vans may differ from the central bus station and on the weekends and evenings, the routes can also be altered for some services. In 2015, share taxis carried 34.7 million passengers, 15.2 million of which were transported on city routes, with the rest going to suburban and inter-city routes.

=== Private taxis ===

Taxis, often called &quot;special taxis&quot; () in Israel, to distinguish them from share taxis, are regulated by the Ministry of Transport. Aside from individual taxi companies, Gett is the primary digital taxi hailing service in the country. In 2017, approximately 90 million rides were made using taxis.

== Railways==
* Total: 1,511 km (standard gauge). In 2017 there were over 64 million passenger rides taken.
Many of Israel&#x27;s railway lines were constructed before the founding of the state during Ottoman and British rule. The first line was the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, followed by the Jezreel Valley railway, which formed part of the greater Hejaz railway. World War I brought the creation of multiple new lines out of military needs: Portions of what is now the Coastal railway were built simultaneously by the Turkish and British and later merged during the British Mandate. Southern lines were also built by the warring states—from the north by the Ottomans, and from Rafah in the west by the British.

Beginning in the mid-1960s, railway development stagnated, and a number of lines (notably, the Jezreel Valley railway and most of the Eastern railway) were abandoned altogether. Development restarted in the 1990s, the opening of Tel Aviv&#x27;s Ayalon railway in 1993 signaling a new era of rail development. Lines under construction in the 2000s include the high-speed railway to Jerusalem, an extension of the coastal railway directly from Tel Aviv to Ashdod through the northern Shephelah, and a line from Ashkelon to Beersheba via Sderot, Netivot and Ofakim, as well as a complete reconstruction of the line from Lod to Beersheba. These and other extensive infrastructure improvements led to a 20-fold increase in the number of passengers served by Israel Railways between 1990 and 2015.

After numerous delays due to the complexity of the project, a new line between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem opened in 2019. This line is the first electrified railway ever built in the country. Israel Railways has ordered Bombardier Traxx electric locomotives for use on this line and for other lines to be converted to electric operation. All existing and future electrified mainline railways in Israel use 25 kV 50 Hz overhead electrification.

The 2023 G20 New Delhi summit proposals included a transit corridor connecting India to the Middle East and Europe through Israel which had been part of earlier Israeli plans designed by Israel Katz, a government transit minister.

===Light rail/Metro===

The 13-kilometre-long Jerusalem Light Rail system began operation in August 2011 and is being extended. The Tel Aviv Light Rail, serving Tel Aviv and surrounding cities, has opened its first line, the Red Line, in August 2023. A significant portion of it is underground, and two other lines are underway, the Green Line and Purple Line. A small portion of the Green Line will be underground while the Purple Line will be entirely above-ground. In addition, the Tel Aviv Metro, a subway system which will serve Tel Aviv and neighboring cities in the Gush Dan area, is planned. It will consist of three lines labelled M1, M2, and M3. The first public opening is expected to occur in 2032.

Haifa&#x27;s Carmelit, an underground funicular railway, was Israel&#x27;s first subway line. It is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the shortest subway system in the world, being the second smallest track network (after the Tünel in Istanbul,) but being the smallest &quot;system&quot; by virtue of being the only urban rail network in the city. The Haifa–Nazareth railway, a planned light rail system from Haifa to Nazareth, which will serve numerous cities and towns along the route, is planned to open in 2025. In August 2023, the construction of the Beersheba Light Rail was approved. The system will serve the city of Beersheba, as well as several towns and a military base near the city. It is expected to be completed in 2033.

===Israel Public Transportation Statistics===
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Israel, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 70 min. 22% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 16 min, while 25% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 13.6 km, while 29.% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

== Air transport ==

Israel has 47 airports, the largest are Ben Gurion Airport (TLV) located near Tel Aviv, Ramon Airport serving Eilat and Uri Michaeli Haifa International Airport. In 2017, Ben Gurion Airport handled nearly 21 million passengers and was the busiest airport in the Eastern Mediterranean in terms of international passengers served. Non-stop flights from Israel travel to North America, Europe, Africa, the Far East, and neighboring countries in the Middle East. Scheduled domestic air service is available between Tel Aviv&#x27;s Ben Gurion Airport and Haifa, Rosh Pina, the Golan Heights, and the southern city of Eilat. Some international charter and low cost flights also land at Eilat Ramon Airport. Ramon Airport opened in 2019 20 km north of Eilat replacing the existing Uvda and Eilat airports. While Uvda reverted to its use as a military airbase upon the opening of Ramon Airport, the old Eilat &quot;city&quot; airport was shut down with the land to be redeveloped.

According to the Israel Civil Aviation Authority, as of 2012, Israel&#x27;s civil aircraft fleet consisted of 59 aircraft; 56 passenger planes, and 3 freighters. 48 of these were Boeing jets, 2 Airbus, 8 turbo-prop produced by ATR, and 1 Embraer jet. Israeli airlines ordered another 2 Embraer jets, 1 ATR airplane, 5 Airbus jets, and 10 Boeing jets, a total of 18 aircraft. It is estimated that Israeli airlines will have 65-70 craft in 2017–2018. Airlines include El Al, Sun D&#x27;Or, Arkia and Israir Airlines. Boeing estimates that 60-80 new aircraft will be purchased by Israeli airlines over the next 20 years.

Israel has 29 airports with paved runways, 18 unpaved landing strips, and 3 heliports.
== Ports and harbors ==

=== Mediterranean Sea ===

* Ashdod Port
* Haifa Port

=== Red Sea ===
On the Gulf of Eilat:
* Eilat Port

== Merchant marine ==
* Total: 18 ships (with a tonnage of or over) totaling /
* Ships by type: Cargo ship 1, Chemical tanker 1, Container ship 16 (2006)
Many ships owned and operated by Israeli companies operate under foreign registries. Israel&#x27;s Zim Integrated Shipping Services is one of the largest shipping companies in the world.

== Cable cars ==

There are six tourist and leisure oriented cable car systems in Israel. These include the cable car in Haifa connecting Bat Galim on the coast to the Stella Maris observation deck and monastery atop Mount Carmel., the cable car in Kiryat Shmona, linking it to Menara 400 meters above the town, the chairlifts and cable cars in the Mount Hermon ski resort in the Golan Heights, the cable car to Masada, near the Dead Sea, enabling tourists to quickly reach the mountain top site, and the cable car at the Rosh HaNikra grottoes site, going down to the chalk cliff and cavernous tunnels on the Mediterranean coast. In addition to that, the Superland amusement park near Rishon LeZion has its own cable car and a public transport-oriented cable car is being developed in Haifa—the Haifa Cable Car.

Additional future plans include a system in western Haifa, and systems in Tiberias, Ma&#x27;alot-Tarshiha, Jerusalem and Ma&#x27;ale Adumim.

== Segway ==
In 2006, the Segway scooter was approved for use on sidewalks and other pedestrian designated locations, as well as roads that have no sidewalks, obstructed sidewalks or sidewalks lacking curb cuts. The user must be over 16 years old. No license is required. The maximum allowed speed is , enforced by electronic restriction put in place by the importer. Companies offering tours of Jerusalem use the second generation i2 model, equipped with Lean Steer Technology that facilitates ski-like steering.

<text>Foreign relations of Israel refers to diplomatic and trade relations between Israel and other countries around the world. Israel has diplomatic ties . Israel is a member of the United Nations (UN) and a number of other international organisations. Israel maintains full diplomatic relations with two of its Arab neighbours, Egypt and Jordan, after signing peace treaties in 1979 and 1994 respectively. In 2020, Israel signed agreements establishing diplomatic relations with three Arab League countries, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco. As of 2021, Israel had formal diplomatic relations with 168 other countries, while twenty-eight UN member states have either never established, or have broken off diplomatic relations with Israel.

Israel&#x27;s foreign relations are influenced primarily by Israel&#x27;s strategic situation in the Middle East, the broader Arab–Israeli conflict and the conflict with Iran particularly over Iran&#x27;s nuclear program, along with the rejection by regional states. Israel&#x27;s foreign policy goals have therefore been to overcome diplomatic isolation and to achieve recognition and friendly relations with as many nations as possible, both in the Middle East region and further afield. Israel practices both open and secret diplomacy to further national goals, for example, commercial trade and science and technology cooperation, importing raw materials, engaging in military procurement as well as exporting arms and military assistance, intelligence cooperation with its allies, and prisoner-of-war exchanges and other arrangements for hostage releases. It has also sought to foster increased Jewish immigration to Israel and to protect vulnerable Jewish communities in the Diaspora, to offer aid to developing countries and humanitarian assistance to countries facing large-scale disasters.

Israel&#x27;s close friendship with the United States has been a linchpin of its foreign policy since the establishment of the state. Until the Iranian Revolution and the fall of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1979, Israel and Iran maintained close ties. Iran was the second Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel as a sovereign nation after Turkey. In the mid-20th century, Israel ran extensive foreign aid and educational programs in Africa, sending experts in agriculture, water management and health care. China is also one of the few countries in the world to concurrently maintain warm relations with both Israel and the Muslim world at large. China&#x27;s geopolitical credibility, reputation, and standing in world affairs has continued to play a significant role in shaping Israel&#x27;s approach to international affairs and foreign policy towards Beijing, owing to China&#x27;s global influence, which aligns harmoniously with the Jewish state&#x27;s sensible economic management, political stability, as well as its regional strategic importance in the Middle East.

During the 2000s, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs warned that the increasing influence of the European Union would further isolate Israel in global affairs. In the wake of a series of diplomatic rifts with Turkey and the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in 2011, Israel had increasingly unfriendly relations with those countries for a few years. During roughly the same period, Israeli relations with many countries in Europe including Greece and Cyprus in the context of the Energy Triangle and in Asia, including China and India, were enhanced, largely on account of the growth of Israel&#x27;s high-tech economy. Israeli ties with Egypt have improved since the Muslim Brotherhood was removed from power there, while ties to Turkey have been uneven since their 2010 nadir.
== Membership in international organizations ==

The first international organization which the Israeli government joined was the International Wheat Council, established as part of Point Four Program in early 1949. Israel has been a member of the United Nations since 11 May 1949.

Israel is a member of many UN agencies, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Israel also participates in other international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Israel left the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in a coordinated move with the US in 2019.

Within the UNESCO, Israel was a member in many international programs and organizations. In the area of science, Israel was an active member of the Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), the International Hydrological Programme (IHP), the International Centre for Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science Applications in the Middle East (SESAME), and the International Geoscience Programme (IGCP).

Other notable organizations Israel is an active member of include the Education For All movement, the European Centre for Higher Education (CEPES), the World Heritage Committee (WHC), the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM), and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). Relations were carried out through the Israeli National Commission for UNESCO.

Israel joined the European Union&#x27;s Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (FP) in 1994, and is a member of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). It is also a member of the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) since 2003.

On 10 May 2010, Israel was invited to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Israel is a member of NATO&#x27;s Mediterranean Dialogue forum. In 2014 Israel joined the Paris Club.

After over 50 years of not being part of a regional grouping in the UN (effectively shut out of many internationals organizations), Israel joined the Western European and Others group on a temporary basis in 2000. Israel joined on a permanent basis in 2014.

== Diplomatic relations ==
After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Israel was subjected to Arab League boycotts and attempts to diplomatically isolate the state. As of 2020, Israel has diplomatic ties , as well as with the Holy See, Kosovo, the Cook Islands and Niue. Some other countries recognize Israel as a state, but have no diplomatic relations. Several countries once had diplomatic relations with Israel, but have since broken or suspended them (Cuba and Venezuela in Latin America, Mauritania in the Arab League, Mali and Niger in non-Arab Africa, the Maldives in South Asia, and Iran until the Islamic revolution). In addition, a number of countries (all members of the Arab League) that at one time had formal economic ties (primarily trade offices) with Israel, which fell short of full diplomatic relations, subsequently severed such ties (Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Tunisia; however, Morocco renewed ties and established diplomatic relations in 2020).

=== List ===
List of countries which Israel maintains diplomatic relations with:
=== No diplomatic relations ===

==== Member states of the United Nations ====
As of 2024, 32 United Nations member states do not maintain diplomatic relations with Israel (period of former relations marked in parentheses):
*Africa: Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Libya, Mali (1960–1973), Mauritania (1999–2009), Niger (1960–1973, 1996–2002), Somalia, Tunisia (trade relations 1996–2000)
:&quot;(Algeria,&quot; &quot;Libya, and&quot; &quot;Somalia do not recognise Israel)&quot;
*Americas: Belize (1985–2023), Bolivia (1950–2009; 2019–2023), Colombia (1957–2024), Cuba (1950–1973), Nicaragua (1948–2024), Venezuela (1950–2009)

:&quot;(Iran,&quot; &quot;Iraq,&quot; &quot;Kuwait,&quot; &quot;Lebanon,&quot; &quot;Saudi Arabia,&quot; &quot;Syria&quot; &quot;and Yemen&quot; &quot;do not recognise Israel as a state)&quot;
*South and Central Asia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Maldives (1965–1974), Pakistan
:&quot;(Afghanistan,&quot;&quot; Bangladesh&quot; &quot;and Pakistan&quot; &quot;do not recognise Israel as a state)&quot;
*Southeast Asia: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia
:&quot;(none of these countries recognise Israel)&quot;

Despite the lack of diplomatic relations, some of these countries accept Israeli passports and acknowledge other indications of Israeli sovereignty.

==== Other states ====

Israel has no diplomatic relations with the following states or entities:
* Taiwan (Republic of China), which recognizes Israel, but does not officially conduct relations (though there are unofficial relations) because of Israel&#x27;s recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
* Other states with limited recognition: Abkhazia, Northern Cyprus, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Somaliland, South Ossetia, Transnistria (Israel has not recognised the independence of any of these entities.)
* Sovereign Military Order of Malta

=== Limited relations ===
Comoros has no official diplomatic ties with Israel but the countries engage in mutual trade.

Israeli citizens are admitted into North Korea with Israeli passports, but like other foreign visitors they are asked to deposit their passport with the local authorities and use specially issued local documents for tourists.

== North Africa and Middle East ==
On 1 October 1994, the Persian Gulf states announced their support for a review of the Arab boycott, abolishing the secondary and tertiary boycotts against Israel.

=== Algeria ===
In the mid-1990s, while Israel and North African states slowly started diplomatic relations, Algeria remained one of the last countries to consider such a move. It was only when Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak met Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika at the funeral of the Moroccan King Hasan II on 25 July 1999 that comments about rapprochement were made.

Algeria and Israel do not have diplomatic relations.

=== Bahrain ===
In 2011, amid Arab spring uprising, Wikileaks cables published on &quot;Haaretz&quot; revealed some of the hidden relations between Bahraini and Israeli officials. In a meeting with the U.S. ambassador in February 2005, Bahrain&#x27;s king, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa had bragged about having contact with Israel&#x27;s national intelligence agency, Mossad. He indicated that Bahrain is ready to develop relations in other fields as well. The king reportedly gave orders that official statements don&#x27;t use phrases such as &quot;enemy&quot; and &quot;Zionist entity&quot; when referring to Israel anymore. However, he refused the idea of having trade relations, saying it was &quot;too early&quot; and would be postponed until the establishment of an independent Palestine state.

Both countries agreed to fully normalize relations in September 2020.

=== Egypt ===
Israel has had full diplomatic relations with Egypt since the signing of the Egypt–Israel peace treaty in 1979. In Israel, the 1978 Camp David Accords were supported by 85% of Israelis, according to a 2001 poll taken by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, based in Israel.

However, Egyptian public opinion of Israel is highly negative. According to an Egyptian Government 2006 poll of 1,000 Egyptians (taken at the time of the 2006 Lebanon War), 92% of Egyptians view Israel as an enemy nation.

Egypt has mediated several unofficial ceasefire understandings between Israel and Palestinians, especially with the Hamas government in the Gaza strip.

=== Iran ===

Relations between Israel and Iran have alternated from close political alliances between the two states, during the era of the Pahlavi dynasty, to open hostility following the rise to power of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. While Iran was the second Muslim-majority country to recognize Israel, the two states do not currently have diplomatic relations with each other, due to Iran&#x27;s withdrawal of its recognition of Israel. The post-1979 Iranian authorities avoid referring to Israel by its name, and instead use the terms &quot;the Zionist regime&quot; or &quot;occupied Palestine&quot;. Iranian passports bear an inscription that says, &quot;The bearer of this passport is forbidden from traveling to occupied Palestine.&quot;

Due to recent rhetoric between Iran and Israel, development of nuclear technology, and Iranian funding of the groups Hamas and Hezbollah, tensions have risen dramatically between the State of Israel and the Islamic Republic of Iran, especially after the election of the hardline Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. Comments made by Ahmadinejad, who has called the Holocaust “a myth” and for Israel to be “wiped off the map”, were perceived by Israel as threats of destruction.

A large population of Iranian Jews lives in Israel, among them former president of Israel Moshe Katsav, former chief of staff / Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz, and former chief of staff Dan Halutz.

=== Iraq ===
No diplomatic relations between Israel and Iraq ever existed, but the issue of establishing such relations was given some consideration.
Following the American-British led invasion of Iraq in 2003, diplomats had been discussing the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and Iraq. However, then-Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said in 2004 that Iraq would not establish ties with Israel.

==== Kurdistan Region ====
In 2006, President of Kurdistan Region Massoud Barzani said: &quot;It is not a crime to have relations with Israel. If Baghdad established diplomatic relations with Israel, we could open a consulate in Hewlêr (Kurdistan).&quot; Israeli television broadcast photographs from the 1960s showing Mustafa Barzani embracing then Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan. In 2004, Israeli officials met with Kurdish political leaders. In 2006 the BBC reported that Israel was training Kurdish militias in Iraqi Kurdistan. In April 2012, it was alleged that high-ranking Kurdish officials had collected the revenues of Iraqi oil that had been smuggled to Israel via the Kurdistan Region.

=== Jordan ===

Israel has full diplomatic relations in peace with Jordan since the signing of the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace in 1994, but relations remain somewhat tense. Over half of the Jordanian populations descends from Palestinian refugees, who overwhelmingly have negative views of Israel.

=== Kuwait ===

Relations between Israel and Kuwait are generally hostile, mainly as part of the Arab–Israeli conflict. In 2019 Kuwait&#x27;s Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Al-Jarallah said &quot;Kuwait will be the last country to normalize relations with Israel&quot;.

=== Lebanon ===

Israel and Lebanon have been overshadowed by war, including the Syrian Occupation of Lebanon (1976–2005). In August 2006, after the clash between Hezbollah and Israel, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora said that Lebanon would be the &quot;last Arab country to make peace with Israel&quot; because of the large number of civilians that were killed in the 2006 Lebanon War.

Since the year 2000, and due to many wars with Hezbollah, Israel treats Lebanon as an &quot;enemy state&quot;, although it is considering the possibility of a non-aggression pact.

In 2008 a Pew Research Center survey found that negative views concerning Jews were most common in Lebanon, with 97% of Lebanese having unfavorable opinion of Jews. In a 2011 survey again by the Pew Research Center, all of the Muslim-majority Middle Eastern countries polled held strongly negative views of Jews. In the questionnaire, only 3% of Lebanese reported having a positive view of Jews.

=== Morocco ===

Moroccan expeditionary forces fought alongside a coalition of Arab countries in the Yom Kippur War against Israel. In 1986, King Hassan II invited then Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres for talks, becoming the second Arab leader to host an Israeli leader after Anwar Sadat. Following the September 1993 signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles, Morocco accelerated its economic ties and political contacts with Israel. In September 1994, Morocco and Israel announced the opening of bilateral liaison offices. When the king died in 1999, then-prime minister Ehud Barak and the Moroccan-born foreign minister David Levy flew to Rabat for his funeral. The foreign offices were closed in 2000 following sustained Israeli-Palestinian violence. In September 2016, Moroccan King Mohammed VI sent his personal adviser Andre Azulai, who is Jewish, to attend the state funeral of former Israeli Prime Minister and President Shimon Peres.

Prior to the establishment of formal relations, Israeli tourism to Morocco was encouraged by the World Federation of Moroccan Jewry, a non-governmental private Jewish organization.

On 10 December 2020, Morocco agreed to establish diplomatic relations with Israel in exchange for the United States supporting Morocco&#x27;s claim on Western Sahara. On the same day, the United States agreed to the sale of sophisticated drones to Morocco.

=== Oman ===

In 1996, Oman and Israel agreed to exchange trade representation offices.

=== Qatar ===
Qatar and Israel do not currently have diplomatic relations, although they maintained economic relations between 1996 and 2000. Qatar is a major financial supporter of the Palestinian Sunni-Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas.

=== Saudi Arabia ===
In 2005, Saudi Arabia announced the end of its ban on Israeli goods and services, mostly due to its application to the World Trade Organization, where one member country cannot have a total ban on another. However, , the Saudi boycott was not cancelled.

In recent years, Saudi Arabia has changed its viewpoint concerning the validity of negotiating with Israel. It calls for Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from territory occupied in June 1967 in order for peace with the Arab states; then-Crown Prince Abdullah extended a multilateral peace proposal based on withdrawal in 2002. At that time, Israel did not respond to the offer. In 2007 Saudi Arabia again officially supported a resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict which supported a full right of Palestinian refugees to move to Israel, which generated more official negative reactions from Israeli authorities.

=== Syria ===
Syria&#x27;s relations with Israel are very poor, due to the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights and Syria&#x27;s close ties with the anti-Israel militant group Hezbollah and with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Since 2004, Syria has accepted the import of apples from farmers in the Golan Heights, territory that it claims, through the Quneitra crossing. This was a result of the ongoing Israeli refusal to accept apples from Golan farmers (reportedly due to over-supply), which led to a plea by the farmers to the Syrian government to accept their produce before it became spoiled in order to prevent economic collapse. In 2010, some 10,000 tons of apples grown by Druze farmers in the Golan Heights were sent to Syria.

=== Tunisia ===
Tunisia participated in the Yom Kippur War, sending 1,000–2,000 troops to fight alongside a coalition of Arab countries against Israel. The relations worsened further in the early 2000s when the Second Intifada began, and on 22 October 2000, the state radio of Tunisia declared that President Ben Ali had decided to break all diplomatic ties with Israel following the &quot;violence in the Palestinian-controlled territories&quot;.

=== Turkey ===

Turkey was the first Muslim-majority nation to formally recognize the State of Israel.

In January 2009, the Turkish government&#x27;s condemnation of the 2008–09 Gaza War severely strained relations between the two countries. Erdoğan harshly criticized Israel&#x27;s conduct in Gaza at the World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland in early 2009.

Relations between the two countries were further strained after the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. On 2 September 2011, Turkey downgraded ties with Israel to second secretary level and suspended military co-operation between the countries.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Following the assassination of Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh in the UAE in 2010, allegedly by Israel, the UAE announced that travelers suspected of being Israeli would not be admitted even if using a foreign passport. Prior to August 13, 2020, UAE had not recognized Israel as a state, and the two countries lacked official diplomatic or economic relations. Prior to the announcement of the 2020 agreement, relations had improved to the extent that Israel opened an office in Abu Dhabi, albeit only as a mission to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

Israel and the United Arab Emirates announced a deal to establish diplomatic relations on August 13, 2020. In July 2021, The United Arab Emirates officially opened an embassy in Israel, becoming only the third majority Arab nation to have full diplomatic relations with Israel.

=== Yemen ===
Yemen and Israel do not have diplomatic relations, and contacts between the two countries are very tense. People with an Israeli passport or any passport with an Israeli stamp cannot enter Yemen, and Yemen is defined as an &quot;enemy state&quot; by Israeli law.

== Sub-Saharan Africa ==
Israel has diplomatic relations with 42 of the 44 Sub-Saharan African states that are not members of the Arab League, including a number of Muslim-majority states.

=== Angola ===
Relations between Israel and Angola are based on trade and foreign policy. In 2005, President José Eduardo dos Santos visited Israel. In March 2006, the trade volume between the two countries amounted to $400 million. The Israeli ambassador to Angola is Avraham Benjamin.

=== Botswana ===
The two countries established relations in 1993. Neither has a formal consulate or embassy in the other country, but the two governments have cooperated on several development initiatives. Six Israeli-centered diamond companies have operations in Botswana.

=== Cameroon ===
H.E. Mr. Henri Etoundi Essomba, Ambassador of Cameroon to Israel in 2012, serves as the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in Israel.

Relations were cut off in the wake of the Yom Kippur war, but restored in 1986, and Cameroon and Israel now have many military and political ties, with Israel training and arming Cameroon&#x27;s rapid reaction forces and Cameroon voting against many anti-Israel resolutions at the UN.

=== Chad ===
In November 2018, Chadian President Idriss Déby paid a visit to Israel. In January 2019, Prime Minister Netanyahu paid a visit to Chad and both nations re-established diplomatic relations. In February 2023, Chadian President Mahamat Deby visited Israel and opened a Chad embassy in the Ramat Gan town in Israel.

=== Djibouti ===

Although Israel does not have diplomatic or official trade relations with Djibouti (a member of the Arab League), following a meeting between officials of both countries in September 1995, plans were then announced to open liaison offices in the respective countries&#x27; capitals, prior to the possible establishment of diplomatic relations between the two states. However, such relations did not materialize.

=== Eritrea ===
Eritrea developed relations with Israel shortly after gaining its independence in 1993, despite protests among Arab countries. Israeli-Eritrean relations are close. The president of Eritrea has visited Israel for medical treatment. However, Eritrea condemned Israeli military action during the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict. Israeli-Eritrean ties are complicated by Israel&#x27;s close ties to Ethiopia.

=== Eswatini ===
Israel established diplomatic relations with Eswatini in September 1968, immediately following that country achieving independence from the United Kingdom. Eswatini was one of only three Sub-Saharan African states (the others being Lesotho and Malawi) that continued to maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and has never severed such ties.

=== Ethiopia ===
In Africa, Ethiopia is Israel&#x27;s main and closest ally in the continent, due to common political, religious and security interests. However, relations were severed between the years 1973 and 1989. Many towns in Ethiopia are named after biblical Israel settlements, including Ethiopia&#x27;s third largest city of Nazret (Adama). Israel also provides expertise to Ethiopia on irrigation projects. Thousands of Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) live in Israel. In 2012, Israel appointed a Beta Israeli of Ethiopian origin, Beylanesh Zevadia, as ambassador to Ethiopia.

=== Ghana ===
Diplomatic relations with Ghana were established immediately following Ghanaian independence in 1957. Agreement on technical cooperation was concluded on 25 May 1962. On 24 May 1968, a trade agreement was concluded. A cultural cooperation agreement was concluded on 1 March 1973.

Relations were broken at the initiative of the government of Ghana on 28 October 1973, following the Yom Kippur war. Improvement in relations followed Israeli attempts to prevent Ghanaian support for the Palestinian Authority, which led to a state visit to Ghana by Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Liberman in September 2009. During that visit, a bilateral agreement for agricultural cooperation was signed. Diplomatic relations were restored in September 2011.

=== Guinea ===
Diplomatic relations between Israel and the Republic of Guinea were established in 1958, but were strained due to the Cold War, as the Israeli government supported US policy while the government of Guinea took a pro-Soviet line. These relations were broken on 5 June 1967 when war broke out between Israel and Egypt in the Six-Day War. After Israel&#x27;s support to Guinea during its fight against the Ebola virus, relations between the two states were restored on 20 July 2016.

=== Kenya ===
Diplomatic relations were established in December 1963. Israel has an embassy in Nairobi and Kenya has an embassy in Tel Aviv. In 2003, Kenya requested Israel&#x27;s help in developing a national solar energy program. In 2006, Israel sent an 80-person search-and-rescue team to Kenya to save people trapped in rubble when a multistory building collapsed. Following the 2007 Kenyan presidential election Israel donated medicine to the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret.

=== Lesotho ===
Lesotho was one of only three Sub-Saharan African states (the others being Eswatini and Malawi) that maintained full diplomatic relations with Israel in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War in 1973.

=== Liberia ===

Liberia was one of the United Nations member states to vote in favor of establishing a Jewish state in Palestine in 1947. Israel and Liberia established relations in the late 1950s. The administration of William Tolbert severed ties with the Israeli government in 1973 in response to the Yom Kippur War, but they were re-established in 1983 by Samuel Doe, who succeeded Tolbert via coup.

=== Madagascar ===
Both countries have a number of bilateral agreements in force.

=== Malawi ===
Israel established diplomatic relations with Malawi in July 1964, immediately following that country achieving independence from the United Kingdom. Malawi was one of only three Sub-Saharan African states (the others being Eswatini and Lesotho) that continued to maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and has never severed such ties.

=== Mauritania ===
Mauritania declared war on Israel as a result of the 1967 Six-Day War, following the Arab League&#x27;s collective decision (although Mauritania was not formally admitted to the League until November 1973). Mautritania did not reverse that declaration until at least 1991.

Mauritania did not abide by moves to recognise Israel&#x27;s right to exist in the same way as most other Arab countries later did, staying true to the 1967 Khartoum Resolution which, in reference to Israel, stated “no peace, no recognition, no negotiable.”

Little public information exists, and an account of Israeli-Mauritanian relations must be inferred from a number of indirect known factors, such as: behind the scenes meetings between Mauritania and Israel in 1995 and 1996, said to be at the instigation of Mauritania&#x27;s President Ould Taya; the establishment of unofficial &quot;interest sections&quot; in the respective Spanish embassies in 1996 in the two capital cities, leading to the exchange of diplomatic representatives in each other&#x27;s countries from 27 October 1999. It is inferred from this evidence that Mauritania had reversed its declaration by then.

On 6 March 2009, the Israeli diplomatic delegation to Mauritania left after nine years of diplomatic ties, following a demand from the Mauritanian authorities to close the Israeli embassy in Nouakchott within 48 hours. The Mauritanian delegation to Israel left earlier without sending official notice to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

=== Mauritius ===
Both countries have signed many bilateral agreements.

=== Namibia ===
=== Niger ===
=== Nigeria ===
Israel and Nigeria established diplomatic relations in 1960. In 1973, Nigeria broke off contacts with Israel, but in May 1992, bilateral relations were restored. Since April 1993, Israel has maintained an embassy in Abuja, and Nigeria has maintained an embassy in Tel Aviv. Many Nigerians go on religious pilgrimage to Israel.

=== Rwanda ===
Relations with Rwanda were established soon following independence of the African state. They were broken by the government of Rwanda on 8 October 1973, during the Yom Kippur war.

In January 2019, transportation ministers of Israel and Rwanda announced plans to inaugurate regular Air Rwanda flights to Israel. Then, in April 2019, Israel opened an embassy in Kigali.

=== Senegal ===
Relations with Senegal were established soon following independence of the African state. They were broken by the government of Senegal on 28 October 1973, following the Yom Kippur war. Israel and Senegal on June 4, 2017, announced the resumption of full diplomatic relations, which had been frozen after Senegal cosponsored a UN Security Council against Israeli settlements. Israel returned its ambassador to Senegal, and Senegal backed Israel&#x27;s candidacy for observer status at the African Union. In a trilateral partnership between Israel, Italy and Senegal, Israeli drip irrigation systems are being installed to help farmers in 12 districts of rural Senegal.

=== South Africa ===

The Union of South Africa was one of only four Commonwealth nations to vote in favour of the 1947 UN partition resolution, which led to the establishment of the State of Israel. South Africa was one of the first states to recognize Israel; diplomatic relations between Israel and South Africa were established in 1948. After the Sharpeville massacre of 1960, Israel became a harsh critic of apartheid, leading to a break in its relations with Pretoria. After 1967, Israel and South Africa became strategic partners again, and this lasted until 1987 when Israel joined the West in forcefully opposing apartheid.

Since the end of apartheid, South Africa&#x27;s new government has been cold toward Israel and critical of Israel&#x27;s policies towards Palestinians but has nevertheless ignored calls from pro-Palestinian South African groups to sever relations between the two countries.

As a result of the Israel–Hamas war, the African National Congress passed a motion calling on the government to close its embassy in Tel Aviv in November 2023. The South African governmental cabinet also called on the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and recalled the country&#x27;s ambassador to Israel and withdrew all the country&#x27;s diplomatic staff from Israel.

=== South Sudan ===
Israel recognized the Republic of South Sudan on 10 July 2011, and offered the new state economic help, following its declaration of independence the previous day from the mainly Arab Muslim north Sudan. On 15 July 2011, South Sudan declared its intention to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel and, on 28 July 2011, it was announced that full diplomatic ties had been established between the two countries.

=== Sudan ===
On 23 October 2020, Sudan agreed to normalise relations with Israel in return for the Trump Administration removing Sudan from the United States&#x27; list of state sponsors of terrorism, unblocking economic aid and investment in Sudan.

=== Togo ===
In May 2009, Israel and Togo signed a &quot;pact for cooperation in the economic, agricultural and educational fields&quot; with each other.

=== Uganda ===

In a joint Israeli-Ugandan project, a professor from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem&#x27;s Faculty of Agriculture conducted a survey of Lake Victoria with a Ugandan colleague from Makerere University. They found that Nile perch, introduced by the British sixty years ago, have decimated native fish populations, leading to malnutrition in the lakeside communities. She helped to set up artificial fish ponds to raise carp, which had disappeared from the local diet. The United States Agency for International Development sponsored the digging of the ponds and sent villagers to Kibbutz HaMa&#x27;apil in Emek Hefer to learn spawning techniques. Graduates of the training program established carp farms.

=== Zambia ===
Both countries have a number of bilateral agreements in force.

=== Zimbabwe ===
Abel Muzorewa, the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, visited Israel on 21 October 1983. He urged Robert Mugabe to establish diplomatic relations, saying his political policies hurt Zimbabwe&#x27;s agriculture and technology industries. In March 2002 an Israeli company sold riot control vehicles to the Mugabe government, shortly before the nation&#x27;s 2002 elections.

== Asia ==
In addition to Turkey and Azerbaijan, Israel has diplomatic relations with 5 non-Arab Muslim states in Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).

=== Afghanistan ===

Afghanistan, currently, has no relations with Israel. The Monarchy of Afghanistan did have spiritual relations with Israel, whether in secret or Tribal rules in place. The Afghan Royal Family trace their origins to King Saul of Israel. Afghanistan was the only Muslim country that did not revoke citizenship when Jews, also known as descendants of Judah, migrated to Israel. Rabbi Eliyahu Avichail has published numerous books linking the Afghans to the Lost Tribes of Israel.

=== Bangladesh ===

Both the Israeli government and general public supported the Bangladesh Liberation War. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Israel offered to recognise the new born country in as early as 1972 but Bangladesh immediately rejected the offer.

Bangladesh does not recognize Israel as legitimate and officially forbids its citizens to travel to Israel by putting &#x27;Valid for travel to all countries except Israel&#x27; on Bangladeshi passports. Bangladesh supports a sovereign Palestinian state and an end to Israel&#x27;s &quot;illegal occupation of Palestine&quot;.

=== Cambodia ===
Israel established diplomatic ties with Cambodia in 1960. Ties were cut in 1975 due to the rise of the Khmer Rouge. The ties were restored in 1993. Israel has no embassy in Cambodia and Cambodia has no embassy in Israel. Instead, the Israeli embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, is accredited to Cambodia. Cambodian students study agriculture in Israel.

=== China ===

On 9 January 1950, the Israeli government extended recognition to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but diplomatic relations were not established until January 1992.

Since 1992, Israel and China have developed increasingly close strategic economic, military, cultural and technological links with each other. Israel maintains an embassy in Beijing and is planning to open a new consulate in Chengdu, its third in mainland China. China is Israel&#x27;s third largest trading partner globally and largest trading partner in East Asia. Trade volume increased from $50 million in 1992 to over $10 billion in 2013. Shared commonalities and similarities between the cultures and values of the two nations with ancient roots dating back thousands of years as well as convergence of interests have made the two countries natural partners. In addition, China is one of the few countries in the world to concurrently maintain warm relations with Israel, the Palestinians, and the Muslim world at large.

China&#x27;s status as a potential world power has prompted Israel to maintain closer ties with China by integrating China&#x27;s global influence with Israel&#x27;s pragmatic economic management, political stability and its regional strategic importance in the Middle East. Beijing has appreciated Israel&#x27;s political stability and diplomatic ingenuity and sees the Jewish state as one of the regional pillars for securing China&#x27;s influence in the Middle East and the entire world.

China and Israel have developed close strategic military links with each other. Bilateral military relations have evolved from an initial Chinese policy of secret non-official ties to a close strategic partnership with the modern and militarily powerful Israel. Israel and China began extensive military cooperation as early as the 1980s, even though no formal diplomatic relations existed. Israel has provided China with military assistance, expertise and technology. According to a report from the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, &quot;Israel ranks second only to Russia as a weapons system provider to China and as a conduit for sophisticated cutting-edge military technology, followed by France and Germany.&quot; Israel was ready to sell China the Phalcon, an Israeli airborne early-warning radar system (AWACS), until the United States forced it to cancel the deal. Some estimate that Israel sold arms worth US$4 billion to China in this period. China has looked to Israel for the arms and military technology it cannot acquire from the United States and Russia. Israel is now China&#x27;s second-largest foreign supplier of arms after Russia. China has purchased a wide array of military equipment and technology, including communications satellites. China is a vital market for Israel&#x27;s aerospace and defense industry. Due to Israel&#x27;s recognition of China, Israel has also limited its cooperation with Taiwan in order to foster closer ties with mainland China.

Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, cultural exchange has been a major component of bilateral relations, as both sides recognize the importance of creating a strong foundation based on their ancient and rich histories.
China&#x27;s receptive and friendly embrace of the Jewish people on its soil has been one of affectionate sympathy as the Chinese have developed a favorable view of Jews, admiring them for their contributions to humanity, their ability to survive, the sharing of Chinese values such as family, frugality, hard work and education, and being products of ancient civilizations have been an impetus towards the long and enduring friendship between the Chinese and Jewish peoples. Shared affinities and similar cultural commonalities has not only been an impetus for the close bonds between China and Israel but has also created a symbol of brotherhood between the two communities.

Though Israel established diplomatic relations with China in 1992, the ties between the Chinese and Jewish people remain centuries old in addition to Israel and China being products of ancient civilizations dating back thousands of years. The cultural similarities between the Chinese and Jewish civilizations with both nations originating thousands of years ago have drawn the two countries closer together making the two countries natural partners in the international community. Chinese Jews have been a major impetus in maintaining the strong nexus between the Chinese and Jewish civilizations. Jews remain a small minority in China, but unlike many parts of the world, Jews have historically lived in China without any instances of antisemitism from the Han majority populace contributing to mutual respect and admiration between the two peoples. With the intrinsic affinity that the Chinese people feel for the Jews, relations between the two communities have been mutually close, harmonious and friendly, due to shared common cultural similarities between the two peoples resulted Jews enjoying equal rights and coexisting peacefully alongside the mainstream Han Chinese populace with instances of Jews assimilating into the Han Chinese community through intermarriage. On a geopolitical scale, China has sought to maintain close relations with the Jewish state as Israel&#x27;s regional importance, stability and influence in an otherwise volatile region has been an important asset for the expansion of China&#x27;s influence in the Middle East and the entire world. Shared commonalities and similarities between the cultures and values of the two nations, ancient roots as well as convergence of interests have driven the two countries closer with respect to scientific, economic, diplomatic and cultural ties.

China is one of Israel&#x27;s closest economic allies in East Asia where both countries have placed considerable importance on maintaining a strategic and economic relationship. The economic synergy has served the two respective countries greatly where Israel&#x27;s global technological prowess combined with China&#x27;s global economic influence, industrial manufacturing capabilities, and marketing expertise made cooperation between the two nations inevitable. China including Hong Kong is Israel&#x27;s second top export destination after the United States and has been the top market for Israeli exports in East Asia. China is also Israel&#x27;s third largest trading partner and export market after the United States and the European Union with China being Israel&#x27;s largest export market in East Asia. Israel has sought China&#x27;s enormous global influence on world affairs, large consumer market, broad industrial manufacturing scale, and burgeoning economic dynamism while China has sought Israel as a powerhouse of advanced technological wizardry and a wellspring of entrepreneurial acumen leveraging each other&#x27;s complementary capabilities and resources. China has sought Israel&#x27;s technology to increase its international economic competitiveness and risk management. With the advice and experience of Jewish entrepreneurs, innovators, and inventors from the high-technology sectors, China has utilized Israel&#x27;s indispensable economic and technological contributions to foster its long-term economic development. China has also expressed desire for Israel&#x27;s advanced technologies, particularly in fields related to agriculture, telecommunications, and defense. The scientific and technological advancements made by Israel have led many Chinese politicians to respect the country&#x27;s ingenuity and creative inventiveness because they know of the contributions Israel has made to its economy. Israeli agricultural techniques, most notably drip irrigation, and solar energy technologies are seen as crucial to China&#x27;s economic development. Throughout Israel&#x27;s early economic history, many Israeli startup companies were acquired by major U.S. and Western European corporations. Since the 2010s, China and Israel enhanced bilateral economic ties with China connecting both Chinese and Israeli businessmen and investors to invest in each other&#x27;s economies respectively. Chinese economic cooperation with Israel has seen substantial Chinese investment of more than US$15 billion in the Israeli economy, spawning seed capital in Israeli startup companies, as well as the acquisition of Israeli companies by major Chinese corporations that incorporate Israel&#x27;s know how to help the invigorate the development of the modern Chinese economy more efficiently. China now ranks second after the United States in collaboration with Israeli high-tech firms that are backed by Israel&#x27;s Office of the Chief Scientist. Major Chinese firms such as Fosun, ChemChina, Brightfood, Horizons Ventures and China Everbright have invested significant amounts of financial capital and resources across numerous Israeli industries. Chinese businessmen and major Chinese corporations hold Israel&#x27;s business, economic and entrepreneurial acumen and technological expertise with high esteem and have sought to integrate Israel&#x27;s know-how with China&#x27;s marketing proficiency, industrial manufacturing capacity and aptitude for large consumer market scaling.

=== Hong Kong ===
Israel and Hong Kong have full diplomatic ties as part of Israel&#x27;s diplomatic ties with China. Israel has a consulate in the city, while Hong Kong is represented in Israel by the Chinese embassy in Tel Aviv.

=== India ===

India established diplomatic relations with the State of Israel in 1992 and has since become Israel&#x27;s strongest ally in Asia. The two countries cooperate in anti-terrorist activities in the Middle East and Southern Asia. Israel is India&#x27;s second largest arms provider and India is Israel&#x27;s principal arms market, and the trade volume between the two countries has increased significantly in the past few years. Co-operation has taken place in the space sector as well with India launching Israeli satellites. India became the top source market for Israel from Asia in 2010 with 41,000 tourist arrivals in that year.

Israel and India share intelligence on terrorist groups. They have developed close defense and security ties since establishing diplomatic relations in 1991. In 2009, Israel overtook Russia as India&#x27;s biggest arms supplier; the U.S. even gave Israel approval to sell the Phalcon to India after earlier forcing Jerusalem to cancel a similar deal with China. India has bought more than $5 billion worth of Israeli equipment since 2002. In addition, Israel is training Indian military units and discussing an arrangement to give Indian commandos instruction in counter-terrorist tactics and urban warfare. In December 2008, Israel and India signed a memorandum to set up an Indo-Israel Legal Colloquium to facilitate discussions and exchange programs between judges and jurists of the two countries. According to an international opinion survey conducted in 2009 on behalf of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, India is the most pro-Israel country in the world.

India-Israel relationship has been very close and warm under the premiership of Narendra Modi since 2014. In 2017, he was the first ever Prime Minister of India to visit Israel. India was the largest arms customer of Israel in 2017. Defence relations between the two countries are longstanding.

=== Indonesia ===


In 2012, Indonesia agreed to informally upgrade its relations with Israel and to open a consulate in Ramallah, headed by a diplomat with the rank of ambassador, who will also unofficially serve as his country&#x27;s ambassador for contacts with Israel. The move, which was agreed upon after five years of sensitive deliberations, represents a de facto upgrading of relations between Israel and the world&#x27;s most populous Muslim country. Indonesia has formally presented the move to open a West Bank consulate as a demonstration of its support for Palestinian independence. In fact, while the ambassador-ranked diplomat will be accredited to the Palestinian Authority/PLO, a significant portion of his work will be in dealings with Israel, and the office will fulfill substantial diplomatic duties as well as consular responsibilities. Israel and Indonesia quietly maintain trade, security and other relations. Israelis can get visas for Bali in Singapore, while many Indonesians come to Israel as pilgrims.

=== Japan ===

On 15 May 1952, diplomatic relations were established with Japan at a Legation level. However, the Japanese government refrained from appointing a Minister Plenipotentiary to Israel until 1955. Relations between the two states were distant at first, but after 1958, no break occurred, despite the Arab oil embargo on several countries, including Japan.

A report compiled by the European Commission indicated that in 2010 Malaysia ranked 15th among Israel&#x27;s major trade partners, accounting for 0.8% (€667.6 million) of Israel&#x27;s trade in that year.

=== Maldives ===
The Maldives established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1965 and severed them in 1974.

In 2009, under president Mohamed Nasheed, the Maldives signed cooperation agreements with Israel on tourism, health, and education and culture. In 2010, the Israeli government sent a team of eye doctors to treat patients and train local medical personnel in the Maldives. However, the renewed relationship did not develop into full diplomatic relations.

In July 2014, under president Abdulla Yameen, the Maldives terminated the cooperation agreements with Israel and announced a boycott of Israeli products, as Israel launched a military operation in Gaza. Foreign minister Dunya Maumoon also announced that the Maldives would fully support Palestinians at international forums such as the United Nations Human Rights Council and offer them humanitarian aid.

=== Mongolia ===
In October 1991 the official relationship of Mongolia and Israel began. Ariel Sharon visited in Mongolia in 2001, when he was minister in the Likud government. Israelis wishing to enter Mongolia are exempt from arming a visa in advance. The Mongolian immigration authorities tend to provide visitors to the country a 30 days visa on their arrival. One can extend the visa fee and the extension is at the discretion of the authorities.

An academic delegation from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem visited the Mongolian National University in August 2010. During the visit, an agreement was signed for cooperation between universities. In 2012, the Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon visited and signed an agreement with the Mongolian Minister of Education which included collaboration between universities and institutions of higher education, in which Mongolians will learn about Israel and the Holocaust and Israel will learn about the heritage and history of Mongolia. It was also agreed on expanding ties between the two countries and embassies.

=== Myanmar ===
Myanmar (also known as Burma) was one of the first countries to recognize Israel and establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Myanmar has also become one of Israel&#x27;s strongest allies in the region, in terms of both technical assistance and also the much debated and rumored military links. Premiers from both sides such as U Nu and David Ben-Gurion made state visits to each other&#x27;s countries in the 1950s. Myanmar sends agriculture researchers to Israel for training. This was further cemented in Israel&#x27;s aid assistance during the Cyclone Nargis disaster of May 2008.

=== Nepal ===

Israel–Nepal relations, first established in 1960, are based on mutual security concerns. Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, Prime Minister of Nepal from 1959 to 1960, had a strongly pro-Israel foreign policy. King Mahendra visited Israel in 1963 and maintained Koirala&#x27;s special relationship. Until the 1990s Nepal was the only South Asian country to have diplomatic ties with Israel.

Nepal is one of the few Asian countries to have consistently supported Israel at international forums and at the UN. Nepal has maintained diplomatic relations and continues to support the right of Israel to exist within secure and internationally recognized boundaries. Nepal voted in favour of Security Council Resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), which upheld the right of all the states in the region to live in peace. Nepal has also welcomed every initiative from whatever quarter that seeks to resolve the Middle East problems like the Camp David Accord signed between Egypt and Israel in 1978 and the renewed peace process sponsored time to time by countries like the USA.

After the 2015 Nepal earthquake, Israel was one of the first to send aid to Nepal. Israel sent a delegation of 264 people for Search &amp; Rescue missions, and over 95 tons of equipment, including a field hospital. It is estimated that about 12,000 Nepalese foreign workers are residing in Israel, most of whom are women working as caregivers.

=== North Korea ===

North Korea does not recognise the state of Israel, denouncing it as an &quot;imperialist satellite&quot;.

=== Pakistan ===


Israel and Pakistan do not have diplomatic relations with each other, and Pakistani passports say &#x27;This passport is valid for all countries of the World except Israel&#x27;. Israeli authorities told a traveller that Pakistanis could apply for a visa, and that they would issue a paper visa and put the entry and exit stamps on it. Some Israeli leaders have expressed the belief that should diplomatic relations with Pakistan be established, then Pakistan could serve as a bridge between Israel and the Muslim world. In 2008, the Israeli Foreign minister stated that &quot;Israel considers Pakistan as its biggest strategic threat&quot; in light of concern over the increasing Taliban threat in Pakistan.

In the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks in India, there was an attack on the Nariman House Jewish community centre. Six people (among them four Israeli citizens), including a Jewish rabbi and his pregnant wife, were killed with some of them being tortured before being killed.

=== Singapore ===
Singapore and Israel have maintained strong and mutually beneficial bilateral relations that are characterized by a close and amiable bond and amicable rapport, where the two nations have consistently cultivated a closely-knit and cordial relationship ever since their respective establishments. This is in part due to both countries&#x27; perception of themselves as diminutive yet affluent sovereign states and regional economic powerhouses surrounded by neighboring Islamic countries characterized by their comparatively underdeveloped societies, political instabilities, and economic struggles that have remained hostile to their continued existence in which oftentimes they have an uneasy relationship with. Following Singapore&#x27;s sudden and unexpected independence after being unilaterally ejected from Malaysia in 1963, Singapore appealed to the international community for technical assistance and military aid. Israel responded by assisting the Southeast Asian city-state with the establishment of Singapore&#x27;s armed forces. Both countries formally established diplomatic relations in May 1969, although unofficial and discrete relations were already established several years prior, particularly with regards to military activities. Singapore and Israel are also known to share a special relationship where they both enjoy an extensive bilateral security partnership, with Israeli and Singaporean arms contractors such as Israel Aerospace Industries and ST Engineering collaborating and engaging in joint venture developments and facilitating a large level of arms trade between the two countries. Over the years, Israel has continued to advise Singapore on an array of military affairs, ranging from night operations to aviation psychology. The defense and intelligence establishments of both countries conduct routine exchanges of information, and a small number of Israeli Defense Force officers serve in staff appointments within the Singapore Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).

Both nations celebrated its 20th anniversary in December 2012. Bilateral cooperation has since then encapsulated tourism, culture, trade, economy, science, education and other fields. In 2013, Belarusian Vice Premier Mikhail Rusyi met top Israeli officials from the Belarusian Agriculture and Food Ministry, the State Committee for Science and Technology, Belarusbank and the Vitebsk Oblast Executive Committee to further facilitate economic cooperation as well as development of innovative technologies into the Belarusian agricultural sector.

=== Belgium ===
=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===
Israel and Bosnia and Herzegovina established diplomatic relations in 1997.

=== Bulgaria ===
Israel and Bulgaria have strong ties. Bulgaria saved the majority of its Jews during World War II — 48,000 were rescued, 11,343 were deported. Israel and Bulgaria established diplomatic relations in 1948. After the Six-Day War Bulgaria cut diplomatic ties with Israel. In 1988, Bulgaria joined the wave of first nations to recognise the State of Palestine, something it has never withdrawn. In 1990 diplomatic relations were renewed. Bulgaria has an embassy in Tel Aviv and Israel has an embassy in Sofia and honorary consul in Varna.

In January 2012, Israel and Bulgaria signed two memorandum of understanding, one was for joint military training exercises and one for cooperation in the defence sector. The two agreements were signed by Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Bulgarian Defense Minister Anyu Angelov. Minister Angelov said the two agreements, in addition to their economic and defense benefits, also &quot;bring a political message – Bulgaria and Israel are a step closer towards stronger cooperation and a strategic dialogue.&quot; After the 2012 Burga bus bombing, Bulgaria and Israel pledged to increase security relations between the two countries discussing various aspects of bilateral cooperation at a meeting at the Ministry of Interior between Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Tsvetlin Iochev and Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Avigdor Leiberman in November 2013. An international investigation led by Bulgaria has established was the work of people linked with the bombing to the military wing of Hezbollah where five Israeli tourists and a Bulgarian citizen died.

The governments of both countries also intend to cooperate in the high-tech sector, the communications sector, health care and agriculture and to continue the positive development of tourism between the two countries and energy resource divestment. Israel also intends to join with Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece and Romania to launch a regional group for crisis response which will boost the partnership between these countries in cases of common security challenges as result of a March 2014 meeting between Avigdor Lieberman and Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetlin Yovchev.

=== Croatia ===
While Croatia was part of the Yugoslavia Federation (1943–1991) it established diplomatic relations with Israel in year 1948 through the Federation, but after Israel attacked Yugoslavia&#x27;s Non-Aligned Movement ally Egypt in the Six-Day War in 1967, Yugoslavia severed all diplomatic relations with Israel. After the breakup of Yugoslavia occurred as a result of a series of political upheavals and conflicts Croatia declared independence on 8 October 1991 and officially renewed its bilateral relations with Israel which recognized Croatia as an independent state on 16 April 1992, but due to some disagreements with the Croatian President Tuđman full diplomatic relations were established 5 years later, on 4 September 1997. Since then relations between Croatia and Israel have been excellent. Croatia has an embassy in Tel Aviv and 4 honorary consulates (in Ashdod, Caesarea, Jerusalem and Kfar Shmaryahu). Israel has an embassy in Zagreb. In addition, Croatia does not recognize the State of Palestine.

=== Cyprus ===

Israel has had diplomatic relations with Cyprus since Israel&#x27;s independence in 1948, when Cyprus was a British protectorate. Israel and Cyprus&#x27; associations have continued to expand since 1960, the year of Cyprus&#x27; independence. The neighboring countries trade regularly and there are high flows of tourism between them. However, Cypriot politicians have frequently spoken out against Israeli military raids in the Palestinian territories as well as the 2006 Lebanon War, during which Cyprus was forced to manage a heavy flow of refugees and aid out of and into Lebanon.

However, the discovery of natural gas in the Leviathan gas field led to a thawing of relations between the two governments. The two countries demarcated their Exclusive Economic Zones in 2010. Israel&#x27;s rising antagonism with Turkey further increased the level of cooperation between the two countries, as Israel compensated by improving its relations elsewhere. In February 2012, Netanyahu visited Cyprus, the first visit of an Israeli Prime Minister in history.

Relations between Israel and Cyprus are based on mutual respect for Western values, the support for free-market economy and the establishment of democracies in the Middle East that would co-exist peacefully.

=== Czech Republic ===
Israel and the Czech Republic share a special relationship. Czechoslovakia was the only country to send aid to Israel in its early years e.g. arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947–1949.

In December 2008, the Czech Air Force wanted to train in desert conditions for the upcoming mission in Afghanistan. No country agreed to help, except Israel. Israel saw it as an opportunity to thank the Czechs for training Israeli pilots when the country was first established.

=== Denmark ===
The relations between Denmark and Israel have been friendly and warm. Denmark voted for the partition of Palestine in 1947 and supports Israel in the United Nations. Denmark was one of few countries in Europe to save most of its Jewish population during the WWII. In Jerusalem, there is a monument to the rescue of Danish Jews, a school is named in Denmark&#x27;s honor, and the King Christian X hospital in Eitanim is named after Denmark&#x27;s king during World War II. Denmark has an embassy in Israel, and Israel has an embassy in Copenhagen.

The political lives of the two states have been somewhat intertwined: The former Israeli minister of social and diaspora affairs Michael Melchior was born in Denmark and is the son of former chief rabbi in Copenhagen, Bent Melchior, the nephew of former Danish minister of traffic and minister of tourism and communication Arne Melchior, and the grandson of the acting rabbi for the Jewish refugees from Denmark in Sweden 1943–45, Marcus Melchior; the executive director of the Peres Center for Peace 2001–2011, Ron Pundak who played an important role in starting the Oslo peace process and was part of the core group behind the Geneva Initiative, is the son of the influential Danish journalist Herbert Pundik; and the prominent Israeli politician Yohanan Plesner, former chairman of the Plesner Committee, is the son of Danish architect Ulrik Plesner.

=== Estonia ===
Estonia and Israel maintain excellent relations. Israel officially recognized the Republic of Estonia on 4 September 1991 and diplomatic relations were established on 9 January 1992. Foreign Minister Urmas Paet opened the Estonian Embassy in Tel Aviv in November 2009.

As of 2012, bilateral trade with Israel was 19.9 million euros.

=== Finland ===
In 2004, a joint Finland-Israel Technology (FIT) cooperation program was created for research and development projects in the field of ICT. The Office of the Chief Scientist in Israel and Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Research and Innovation, allocated five million euros each for the funding of projects. In 2005, Finnish exports to Israel totaled 155,24 million euros and imports from Israel to Finland totaled 95.96 million euros. Finland&#x27;s leading exports to Israel are telecommunications equipment and machinery, and Israeli fruits and vegetables.

=== France ===

In the early 1950s, France and Israel maintained close political and military ties as common enemies of Pan-Arab nationalism. France was Israel&#x27;s main weapons supplier until its withdrawal from Algeria in 1962 removed most common interest from the relationship, and France became increasingly critical of Israel. This new reality became clear when, in the crisis leading up to the Six-Day War in June 1967, Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s government imposed an arms embargo on the region, mostly affecting Israel, which had relied on France for weapons over the previous decade. Under François Mitterrand in the early 1980s, French–Israeli relations improved greatly. Mitterrand was the first French president to visit Israel while in office. In 1967, after the Six-Day War, 5,300 French Jews immigrated to Israel.

=== Georgia ===
Relations between Israel and Georgia remain excellent. Georgia&#x27;s former defense minister from 2006 to 2008, Davit Kezerashvili, had previously lived in Israel. Israel has been selling weapons to Georgia for seven years financed by grants from the USA Included in these weapons are Israeli-built spy drones provided through the former mayor of Tel Aviv, Roni Milo. Israeli advisors, estimated to number between 100 and 1,000, have trained the Georgian military for some time. The two nations also maintain a visa free policy where Georgian and Israeli officials signed an agreement to lift visa requirements for Georgian citizens traveling to Israel, reciprocating Georgia&#x27;s visa-free policy for Israelis in place since mid-2005.

Georgia has its embassy in Tel Aviv, and the State of Israel has its embassy in Tbilisi. In June 2013, Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili praised the Jewish people and Israel and has sought to increase relations between Israel and Georgia elucidating his special relationship between him, Georgia and the Jewish people. Ivanishvili also wanted to extend strategic partnerships and as well as furthering economic cooperation by making it easier for Israeli entrepreneurs and investors to not just do business in Israel, but also facilitate the right paths to do business for the Georgians. The Israel-Georgia Chamber of Business was established in 1996 in order to facilitate business transactions between the two friendly countries and acting as a guide for Israeli businesses through the Georgian economy. Major sectors include insurance, real estate and construction, medical and dental solutions, industrial and utility projects, and energy.

=== Germany ===

Due to its role in the Holocaust, Israel was at first extremely hostile towards Germany and initially refused to establish relations with them. However, relations gradually thawed as Germany offered to pay reparations in 1952, and diplomatic relations were officially established in 1965. Israel and Germany now maintain a &quot;special relationship&quot; based on shared beliefs, Western values and a combination of historical perspectives. Among the most important factors in their relations is Nazi Germany&#x27;s role in the genocide of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust.

Germany is a prime supplier of arms to Israel, including Dolphin submarines. The military co-operation has been discreet but mutually profitable: Israeli intelligence, for example, sent captured Warsaw Pact armor to West Germany to be analyzed. The results aided the German development of an anti-tank system.

=== Greece ===
Both Greece and Turkey recognized the State of Israel in the late 1940s, but were diplomatically represented in Tel Aviv on lower-than-embassy levels. Greek–Israeli relations improved in 1995. 

Greece–Israel relations improved as Turkey–Israel relations worsened in the aftermath of the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. In October 2010, the Israeli and Greek air-forces trained jointly in Greece. According to the BBC, this signified a boost in ties that was due in large part to Israel&#x27;s rift with Turkey. In November 2011, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece&#x27;s Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise at the Uvda base.

The joint Cyprus–Israel oil and gas explorations are also an important factor for Greece, given its strong links with Cyprus. Additionally Greek and Israeli state controlled energy companies are planning to lay the world&#x27;s longest subsea power cable, linking Israel, Cyprus and Greece by 2023. The link, called the EuroAsia Interconnector project, will be the longest in the world.

A new joint action committee for the Greek–Israeli alliance has been created in the U.S. Congress in early 2013. The creation and goals of the Greek-Israeli Caucus under the name Congressional Hellenic-Israel Alliance were announced at a special event held in the Congress. It is co-chaired by Congress members Gus Bilirakis the Republican representative from Florida and Ted Deutch the Democrat from Florida, and the Greek-Israeli Caucus consists of powerful members of both Republican and Democratic party. It is estimated that it may become the most important pressure group in Congress by 2014.

=== Holy See ===
Before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the Vatican opposed Zionist policies and objectives in Palestine. In 1947, during discussions at the United Nations about the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the Vatican supported the internationalization of Jerusalem, in order to keep the holy places away from either Israeli or Arab sovereignty. In October 1948, as the 1948 Arab–Israeli War was in progress, Pope Pius XII, deeply disturbed by that violent conflict, issued the encyclical &quot;In multiplicibus curis&quot;, in which he called on the peace-makers to give Jerusalem and its outskirts &quot;an international character&quot; and to assure – &quot;with international guarantees&quot; – freedom of access and worship at the holy places scattered throughout Palestine. In April 1949, he issued the encyclical &quot;Redemptoris nostri cruciatus&quot;, in which he appealed for justice for the Palestinian refugees and repeated his call for an &quot;international status&quot; as the best form of protection for the holy places.

In January 1964, Pope Paul VI visited Israel, the first such Papal visit.

Following the Six-Day War, the Vatican modified its position on the holy places. In an address to the College of Cardinals in December 1967, Pope Paul VI called for a &quot;&quot;special statute&quot;, internationally guaranteed&quot; for Jerusalem and the Holy Places, thus changing the previous demand for the internationalization of Jerusalem.

Diplomatic relations between the Israeli government and the Vatican were established in 1994, following the conclusion of the Fundamental Agreement between the Holy See and the State of Israel, signed on 30 December 1993. The Holy See (the Vatican), which has UN observer status, is the only non-UN member state with which Israel has diplomatic relations and the only non-UN member state recognised by Israel. An important organ in these relations is the Israel-Vatican Bilateral Commission, established under article 10 of the Agreement to resolve economic issues between the parties.

In 2000, Pope John Paul II visited Israel, followed by visits of Pope Benedict XVI (2009) and Pope Francis (2014). The bilateral commission convened on 30 April 2009 and 10 December 2009.

=== Hungary ===

Hungary and Israel established full diplomatic relations in 1948 and severed during the Six-Day War in 1967. Relations were restored in 1989 with improved relations as well as the opening of embassies and consulates with Hungary having an embassy in Tel Aviv and 4 honorary consulates (in Eilat, Haifa, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv) and Israel has an embassy in Budapest and an honorary consulate in Szeged. Both countries have stressed the increasing of trade and tourism between one another and an estimated 30,000 Hungarian Jews emigrated to Israel in 1948. Both nations are also members of the Union for the Mediterranean.

In January 2022, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett thanked his Hungarian counterpart, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, for the Hungarian government&#x27;s consistent support of Israel at international forums.

=== Ireland ===
Full diplomatic relations between Ireland and Israel were established in 1975. As of 2023, the Israeli ambassador to Ireland is Dana Erlich and the Irish ambassador to Israel is Sonya McGuinness.

The Irish government followed a similar line to other EU governments during the 2006 Lebanon War, with the Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, condemning the actions of Israel as &quot;reckless and disproportionate&quot; and calling for an immediate ceasefire on both sides, while also condemning the actions of Hezbollah. During the conflict, a shipment of bombs that attempted to land in Ireland from USA to Tel Aviv was denied use of Irish airspace and airfields by the Irish Government. The weapons were part of a series of agreed arms shipments between the United States Government and Israel. The shipments were diverted via Scotland, where they also caused controversy.

In 2010, the Israel Defense Forces forcibly boarded an Irish aid ship destined for the Gaza Strip which resulted in worsened relations, Israel&#x27;s Mossad was also involved in the counterfeiting of Irish passports, 2 members of the Israeli ambassador&#x27;s security staff in Dublin were subsequently deported. In 2010, there were numerous protests at the Israeli embassy in Ireland over the treatment of Palestinians.

In December 2024, Israel announced that it would close its embassy in Dublin due to what it described as &quot;the extreme anti-Israel policies of the Irish government&quot;.

=== Italy ===

Relations between Italy and Israel remain strong, with frequent diplomatic exchanges and a large volume of trade. The Israeli Government has followed with great attention the fight against international terrorism pursued by the Italian Government.

=== Kosovo ===
On 17 February 2008, Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia, a move Serbia rejects. Kosovo has been recognized by a substantial number of UN members, including the United States and most members of the European Union. At the time of the declaration, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official stated: &quot;We haven&#x27;t decided when we&#x27;re going to decide, and instead will monitor events and consider the issue.&quot; Israel was reluctant to recognize Kosovo&#x27;s independence, in part because of the possibility of Palestinians using recognition of Kosovo to justify their own unilateral declaration of independence. On 21 September 2018 the president of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci told that he would place the Kosovo embassy in Jerusalem if Israel recognized Kosovo as an independent state. Israel and Kosovo agreed to establish diplomatic relations on 4 September 2020. In March 2022, Kosovo officially opened its embassy in Jerusalem after becoming the first Muslim-majority territory to recognise Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital.

=== Latvia ===
Latvia and Israel established diplomatic relations 6 January 1992. In October 2012, Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs called on Israeli officials for the development of economic and trade contacts between both countries and support for Latvia&#x27;s accession to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Rinkevics also met with Israeli President Shimon Peres on behalf of President Berzins to visit Latvia. Rinkevics and Peres agreed on the key significance of education and knowledge-based economies for the development of small countries further paving opportunities for our future cooperation between the two nations.

Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman also corroborated claims that Israel is interested in forging closer relations with Latvia as Rinkevics emphasized the 20th anniversary of relations between Latvia and Israel in 2012 and both foreign ministers expressed their commitment to strengthening economic and trade cooperation, including contacts between Latvian and Israeli entrepreneurs and a more cooperative operation in the fields of education, culture and science.

=== Lithuania ===
Israel recognized Lithuania&#x27;s independence in 1991. Both countries established diplomatic relation in 1992. Israel has an embassy in Vilnius. Lithuania has an embassy in Tel Aviv and two honorary consulates (in Herzliya and Ramat Gan). Relations are warm and friendly between the two nations and both bi-national trade and tourism has doubled, and two new regularly scheduled flights have just been set between the two countries since 2010.

Lithuanian achievements, particularly Lithuania&#x27;s achievements in biochemistry and the biosciences have attracted Israeli entrepreneurs and investors to invest in Lithuania&#x27;s science and technology sector and Lithuania is enthusiastic in combining Israel&#x27;s knack for unlocked untapped entrepreneurial and intellectual potential combined with Lithuania&#x27;s strong science and technology research base and talented workforce. Both nations have concluded an agreement on cooperation in industrial research and experimental development as further cooperation within venture capital to fund joint research projects remains underway.

Bilateral meetings between both nations reached unexpected highs between 2009–2011 and cooperations between the two nations remain excellent with several forms of cooperation that include science, economics, education, and culture as emphasized by Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite has stated Israel as model of innovation in which is one of the reasons that Lithuania is interested in enhancing its bilateral relations.

In 2011 alone, Israeli tourism to Lithuania grew by 62 percent, and Lithuanian exports to Israel increased by 54 percent. Israel&#x27;s leading pharmaceutical company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, has a manufacturing plant in Lithuania and TEVA recently invested in &quot;Sicor Biotech&quot;, a Lithuanian biotechnological pharmaceutical company, further signifying economic cooperation and encourages the development of such sciences as biotechnology and genetic engineering in Lithuanian universities.

Israeli companies have taken a very active interest in possibilities for carrying out clinical research in Lithuania; many of them are already in cooperation with Lithuanian medical institutions and have invested in Lithuania&#x27;s burgeoning life sciences sector. In 2013, Lithuanian biotechnology company ProBioSanus signed a representation agreement with Bharat Israel where ProBioSanus&#x27; natural, probiotic-based cleaning and personal care products will be available for sale in Israel for the first time. The company already opened stores in Lithuania and Scandinavia. Mr Andrejauskas, head of ProBioSanus spoke of this agreement saying that &quot;We have a strong scientific base and intellectual potential in Lithuania, so we are allocating particular attention to the creation of new formulas and products.&quot; Besides Israeli investments in the Lithuanian life science&#x27;s sector, Lithuanian presence in Israel in the food industry remains strong as Israeli supermarkets sell Lithuanian cheese, curd desserts, Vilnius mayonnaise, Žemaitijos Pienas butter, Panevėžys ice cream, Švyturys-Utenos Alus beers and various styles of Lithuanian liquors. According to Vadimas Ivanovas, a business and financial analyst at Enterprise Lithuania, says that Israeli retail chains are very interested in Lithuanian sweets, pastries, canned vegetables, various sauces, alcoholic beverages, mineral water. &quot;Veal is particularly popular.&quot;

=== Luxembourg ===
In November 1947, Luxembourg voted in favor of the partition plan to create a Jewish state. Israel and Luxembourg established full diplomatic relations in 1949. Due to Luxembourg&#x27;s small size, the Israeli embassy is located in Brussels and Luxembourg is represented politically by the Dutch embassy and economically by the Belgian embassy.

Though the volume of trade between Israel and Moldova was low, Larisa Miculet, the third Ambassador of Moldova to Israel, has stated that there numerous untapped potential of increasing bilateral trade. For Israeli entrepreneurs and investors, Moldova is geopolitically convenient because of its location in the center of Europe, its high transparency between public authorities and foreign investors and due to its having eliminated most of the bureaucratic barriers that hinder business activities. Various business sectors of cooperation between Israel and Moldova range from pharmaceuticals, energy, information technology and software, electronics and electronic equipment, power engineering, metal and plastics processing and construction materials but Moldova has stressed foreign Israeli investments in all segments of the Moldovan economy.

Relations between the Israel and the UK began as hostile. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, Britain detained 8,000 Jewish men of military age attempting to make aliyah to Israel in Cyprus, so they could not participate in the fighting. Britain supplied weapons to the Arab states, and almost went to war with Israel. When Israel captured the Negev, the British Ministry of Defence began to draw up plans for a possible invasion of Israel. British planes spied on Israeli positions, and war between the two countries became even more possible when four British planes were shot down by Israel. However, the two countries began to soften later on, and trade began. In 1956 Israel invaded Sinai Peninsula in agreement with France and the UK that invaded Suez. Nevertheless, Anglo-Israeli relations became turbulent in the summer of 2006 when Prime Minister Tony Blair, along with many other European leaders criticized IDF airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, which had high civilian casualties.

=== Nicaragua ===
1974–1978: Israel sold arms to Somoza &quot;régime&quot;.

On 1 June 2010 Nicaragua suspended diplomatic ties with Israel in response to the Gaza flotilla raid. Relations were restored in March 2017.

== North America ==
=== Canada ===
Canada&#x27;s relationship with Israel began in 1947, when Canada was represented on the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP). Canada was one of the 33 countries (including only four Commonwealth members) that voted in favour of the 1947 UN partition Plan, thus beginning a longstanding relationship with the Jewish state based on a shared commitment to democratic values, understanding, and mutual respect.

=== Cuba ===
Cuba sent troops to fight against Israel during the War of Attrition. Cuba also joined the expeditionary forces during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and broke diplomatic relations with Israel the same year.

As Cuba&#x27;s enemy and a very close United States ally, Israel was the only country in the world that consistently sided with the U.S. blockade against Cuba.

In late 2010, Fidel Castro, who at this time no longer held office in Cuba&#x27;s government, stated that he believes Israel has a &#x27;right to exist&#x27;, which is a shift from his &quot;régime&quot;&#x27;s earlier policy.

=== Mexico ===
Mexico and Israel have had diplomatic relations since January 1950. Throughout the years, they have maintained close relations with each other. In 2000, a free trade agreement was signed between the two nations. Mexico has also purchased weapons from Israel and is one of Israel&#x27;s closest allies in the Americas.

=== United States ===

The relations between Israel and the United States have evolved from an initial United States policy of sympathy and support for the creation of a Jewish state in 1948 (It was the first country to recognize the establishment of the State) to an unusual partnership that links Israel with the United States trying to balance competing interests in the Middle East region. The United States has been considered Israel&#x27;s most powerful and supportive ally and hosts the annual Salute to Israel Parade in New York City. From 1948 to 2012, the United States has provided Israel with $233.7 billion in aid (after adjusting for inflation). In addition, the US has provided Israel with $19 billion in loan guarantees.

The United States is Israel&#x27;s largest trading partner, accounting for 22.4 percent of Israel&#x27;s $43.19 billion in imports, and 42.1 percent of Israel&#x27;s $40.14 billion in exports annually (2005). The U.S. also provides Israel with $2.4 billion in military assistance annually, which is equivalent to 24.5 percent of Israel&#x27;s military expenditures. (2005).

== Oceania ==

=== Australia ===

Australia was one of the four Commonwealth nations to vote in favour of the 1947 UN partition resolution. Australia and Israel established full diplomatic relations in January 1949. Australia has an embassy in Tel Aviv and Israel likewise in Canberra. In May 2010, the Australian government expelled an Israeli diplomat over the misuse of Australian passports in the assassination of Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh, which Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said was &quot;not the act of a friend.&quot;

=== Marshall Islands ===
The Marshall Islands is one of the most consistent supporters of Israel international affairs, along with the United States, Micronesia and Palau. The Marshall Islands is a country in free association with the United States, and thus consistently vote in favor of the United States.

=== Micronesia ===
The Federated States of Micronesia is one of the most consistent supporters of Israel in voting at the UN.

In January 2010, the President of the Federated States of Micronesia, Emanuel Mori, and the President of the Republic of Nauru, Marcus Stephen, with their foreign ministers, visited Israel to expand ties on issues such as healthcare, solar energy, water conservation, clean technologies and other areas in which Israel can provide expertise. They met with Israeli leaders including the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Shimon Peres and Minister of Foreign Affairs Avigdor Lieberman.

=== Nauru ===
Israel and the Republic of Nauru established official diplomatic relations in 2013 and collaborated on various subjects. Nauru, like other Pacific islands such as the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau, is a consistent supporter of Israel in international bodies, including the United Nations.

=== New Zealand ===
New Zealand was one of the four Commonwealth nations to vote in favour of the 1947 UN partition resolution. Since then, most New Zealand governments have been supportive of Israel. After 53 years of full diplomatic relations, the Israeli Embassy in Wellington closed in 2004 due to $5.4 million in cost-cuts by the Israeli Foreign Ministry. It was speculated that trade with Arab countries were a major factor. In June 2004, the New Zealand Government criticized Israel&#x27;s policy of bulldozing Palestinian homes and donated $534,000 to aid homeless Palestinians. At one time there were four missions in the South Pacific area in Canberra, Sydney, Wellington and Suva in Fiji. Following the closure, only Canberra remained open, which was responsible for New Zealand-Israeli Relations. In 2009, the Israel Foreign Ministry announced the reopening of the embassy in Wellington.

In mid-2004, two suspected Mossad agents were jailed for three months and paid a $35,000 fine for trying on false grounds to obtain a New Zealand passport. High-level visits between the two countries were cancelled, visa restrictions imposed for Israeli officials, and an expected visit to New Zealand by Israeli president Moshe Katsav was cancelled. More than a year later, Israel apologized and New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that it was time to resume friendly diplomatic relations with Israel.

=== Niue ===
Diplomatic relations between Israel and Niue were established on August 3, 2023.

=== Palau ===
Palau is one of the most consistent supporters of Israel in the United Nations and other international affairs along with the United States, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands. In 2006, Palau had the highest voting coincidence with Israel in the United Nations.

=== Papua New Guinea ===
=== Tuvalu ===
Israel maintains a non-resident embassy to Tuvalu in Jerusalem and Tuvalu has voted together with Israel against UN resolutions furthering Palestinian sovereignty on occasion.

== South America ==

=== Argentina ===

In 1992, three Israeli diplomats were killed in the bombing of the Israeli Embassy which left 29 people dead and 240 wounded. Two years later, another bombing took place at the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people and wounding 300. The investigation was never completed. Néstor Kirchner called this a national disgrace, and reopened the files.

=== Bolivia ===
In January 2009, Bolivia limited its foreign relationship with Israel in the wake of strikes in Gaza by Israel. Bolivian President Evo Morales has reportedly promised to take Israel to an international court for alleged war crimes committed in Gaza. Bolivia originally granted visa free access to Israeli citizens. However, as a result of Israel&#x27;s 2014 military operation in Gaza, which it opposed, President Evo Morales declared Israel a &quot;terrorist state&quot; and his government will now require Israeli citizens to obtain a visa to visit Bolivia. Morales has called Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians &quot;a genocide&quot;.

Following Morales&#x27;s resignation and fleeing to Mexico in November 2019, relations were restored to their previous status.

On 1 November 2023, following the escalation of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war, Deputy Foreign Minister of Bolivia Freddy Mamani announced that Bolivia would be cutting diplomatic ties with Israel. This made Bolivia the first country to cut relations with Israel in response to the conflict.

=== Brazil ===

Brazil played a large role in the establishment of the State of Israel. Brazil held the Presidency office of the UN General Assembly in 1947, which proclaimed the Partition Plan for Palestine. The Brazilian delegation to the U.N., supported and heavily lobbied for the partition of Palestine toward the creation of the State of Israel. Brazil was also one of the first countries to recognize the State of Israel, on 7 February 1949, less than one year after Israeli Declaration of Independence.

Nowadays, Brazil and Israel maintain close political, economic and military ties. Brazil is a full member state of Israel Allies Caucus, a political advocacy organization that mobilizes pro-Israel parliamentarians in governments worldwide. The two nations enjoy a degree of arms cooperation as Brazil is a key buyer of Israeli weapons and military technology. Also, Brazil is Israel&#x27;s largest trading partner in Latin America. Israel has an embassy in Brasília and a consulate-general in São Paulo and Brazil has an embassy in Tel Aviv and an honorary consulate in Haifa. A longstanding dispute between Israel and Brazil is ongoing over Brazil&#x27;s official rejection of a new Israeli ambassador because of his ties to the West Bank.

Brazil-Israel relations have improved significantly during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro since 2019. Brazilian president Bolsonaro has expressed his love for Israel several times. He has even said to have turned Brazil into Israel&#x27;s new best friend.
In December 2019, Brazil opened a trade office in Jerusalem. Brazil also considered to move its embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

Brazil has the ninth largest Jewish community in the world, about 107,329 by 2010, according to the IBGE census. The Jewish Confederation of Brazil (CONIB) estimates to more than 120,000.

=== Chile ===
Chile recognized Israel&#x27;s independence in February 1949. Israel sent its first ambassador to Chile in May 1950, and Chile sent its first ambassador to Israel in June 1952.

=== Guyana ===
Both countries have established diplomatic relations on 9 March 1992.

=== Paraguay ===
In September 2018, Paraguay announced that it was moving its embassy in Israel out of Jerusalem and back to Tel Aviv, just months after a previous Paraguayan administration had opened the new mission. The US, Guatemala and Paraguay, all moved their embassies to Jerusalem in May 2018. Paraguay said it had officially recognized the military wings of Palestinian group Hamas and Lebanon&#x27;s Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, drawing praise from Israel. President Mario Abdo Benitez made the declaration in an official document in August 2019.

=== Peru ===
Israel and Peru established diplomatic relations in 1957. In 1998 the two countries began talks on a free-trade agreement. Israel sent rescue teams and medical aid to Peru after earthquakes in 1970, 2005 and 2007. In 2001, Eliane Karp, a former Israeli, became the First Lady of Peru.

===Suriname===
Suriname and Israel established diplomatic relations on 24 February 1976. In February 2011, non-resident Israeli ambassador to Suriname, Amiram Magid, criticized the government of Suriname for recognizing the State of Palestine. On 30 May 2022, in a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, Surinamese Foreign Minister Albert Ramdin announced plans to open a Surinamese embassy in Jerusalem in the near future. On 23 June, Surinamese President Chan Santokhi announced the cancellation of the Jerusalem embassy plans, citing a lack of funds.

=== Uruguay ===
Israel has an embassy in Montevideo. Uruguay has an embassy in Tel Aviv and 2 honorary consulates in Ashdod and Haifa. Uruguay was one of the first nations to recognise Israel as independent.

=== Venezuela ===
Relations were once strong, but the bilateral ties soured under the Presidency of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. The Jewish population in Venezuela, which peaked at 45,000, is now below 15,000 &quot;as a result of severe instability in the country&quot;, according to the Israeli Stephen Roth Institute. &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, &quot;Jewish Times&quot;, and Jewish organizations have reported large-scale emigration of Jewish people from Venezuela during the Chávez administration. As a result of the June/July 2006 battles in the Gaza Strip, Venezuela withdrew its ambassador to Israel. Following the Israeli attack on Gaza in December 2008 and January 2009, Venezuela cut its diplomatic ties with Israel. Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez called the attack &quot;genocidal&quot;, and urged that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert be tried for war crimes.

<text>Freedb was a database of user-submitted compact disc track listings, where all the content was under the GNU General Public License. To look up CD information over the Internet, a client program calculated a hash function from the CD table of contents and used it as a disc ID to query the database. If the disc was in the database, the client was able to retrieve and display the artist, album title, track list and some additional information.

Freedb was launched in 2001 based on the CDDB (Compact Disc DataBase) after it had been changed to a proprietary license and renamed &quot;Gracenote&quot;. the Freedb database held just under 2,000,000 CDs. As of 2007, MusicBrainz – a project with similar goals – had a Freedb gateway that allowed access to their own database. The Freedb gateway was shut down on March 18, 2019.

In 2020, Freedb was shut down by Magix, a German company that had acquired it in 2006.

== History ==
The original software behind CDDB was released under the GNU General Public License, and many people submitted CD information thinking the service would also remain free. The license was later changed, however, and some programmers complained that the new license included certain terms that they couldn&#x27;t accept: if one wanted to access CDDB, one was not allowed to access any other CDDB-like database (such as Freedb), and any programs using a CDDB lookup had to display a CDDB logo while performing the lookup.

In March 2001, CDDB, now owned by Gracenote, banned all unlicensed applications from accessing their database. New licenses for CDDB1 (the original version of CDDB) were no longer available, since Gracenote wanted to force programmers to switch to CDDB2 (a new version incompatible with CDDB1 and hence with Freedb). The license change motivated the Freedb project, which is intended to remain free.

In a 2006 interview with Wired, CDDB co-creator Steve Scherf pushed back against criticism that with the license change, Gracenote had privatized a public good created by the work of unpaid volunteers, noting that the data submitted to CDDB before the license remained available for download on freedb, and arguing that the stagnation of freedb at that point showed that &quot;the focus and dedication required for CDDB to grow could not be found in a community effort&quot;.

Because it inherited CDDB&#x27;s limitations, there is no data field in the Freedb database for composer. This limits its usefulness for classical music CDs. Furthermore, CDs in a series are often introduced in the database by different people, resulting in inconsistent spelling and naming conventions across discs.

Freedb was used primarily by media players, cataloguers, audio taggers and CD ripper software. As of version 6 of the Freedb protocol, Freedb accepted and returned UTF-8 data.

Magix acquired Freedb in 2006. MusicBrainz – a project with similar goals – released a Freedb gateway in 2007, allowing users to harvest information from the MusicBrainz database rather than Freedb. This service was shuttered in 2019. A 2011 review observed that &quot;unlike the flat file database structure of freedb.org, MusicBrainz is structured as a relational database, which has allowed MusicBrainz to expand its scope.&quot;

In June 2020, Freedb.org went offline (after its impending shutdown had been announced in March 2020). Asked by Heise News about the reasons for the service&#x27;s demise, Magix stated that the updates required by a changing legal and technical environment had made it uneconomical to maintain. An expert quoted by Heise ruled out server costs as the reason, observing that a single request to the service amounted to just around five kilobytes of transferred data.

gnudb.org, short for &#x27;Global Network Universal Database&#x27;, has continued to provide the Freedb.org database after Freedb.org was shut down. gnudb.org is not affiliated with the GNU project.

<doc id="74584" wikidata="Q259856" url="?curid=74584" title="Crippleware">
<text>Crippleware is computer software or hardware that has been intentionally designed to have some of its features disabled or not working to its full capability.

In software, crippleware means that &quot;vital features of the program such as printing or the ability to save files are disabled until the user purchases a registration key&quot;. While crippleware allows consumers to see the software before they buy, they are unable to test its complete functionality because of the disabled functions.

Hardware crippleware is &quot;a hardware device that has not been designed to its full capability&quot;. The functionality of the hardware device is limited to encourage consumers to pay for a more expensive upgraded version. Usually the hardware device considered to be crippleware can be upgraded to better or its full potential by way of a trivial change, such as removing a jumper wire. The manufacturer would most likely release the crippleware as a low-end or economy version of their product.

==Computer software==
Deliberately limited programs are usually freeware versions of computer programs that lack the most advanced (or even crucial) features of the original program. Limited versions are made available in order to increase the popularity of the full program (by making it more desirable) without giving it away for free. Examples include a word processor that cannot save or print, and unwanted features, for example screencasting and video editing software programs applying a watermark (often a logo) onto the video screen. However, crippleware programs can also differentiate between tiers of paying software customers.

The term &quot;crippleware&quot; is sometimes used to describe software products whose functions have been limited (or &quot;d&quot;) with the sole purpose of encouraging or requiring the user to pay for those functions (either by paying a one-time fee or an ongoing subscription fee).

The less derogatory term, from a shareware software producer&#x27;s perspective, is &quot;feature-limited&quot;. Feature-limited is merely one mechanism for marketing shareware as a damaged good; others are time-limited, usage-limited, capacity-limited, nagware and output-limited. From the producer&#x27;s standpoint, feature-limited allows customers to try software with no commitment instead of relying on questionable or possibly staged reviews. Try-before-you-buy applications are very prevalent for mobile devices, with the additional damaged good of ad-displays as well as all of the other forms of damaged-good applications.

From an Open Source software providers perspective, there is the model of open core which includes a feature-limited version of the product and an open-core version. The feature-limited version can be used widely; this approach is used by products like MySQL and Eucalyptus.

==Computer hardware==
This product differentiation strategy has also been used in hardware products:
* The Intel 486SX which was a 486DX with the FPU removed or in early versions present but disabled.
* AMD disabled defective cores on their quad-core Phenom and Phenom II X4 processor dies to make cheaper triple-core Phenom and Phenom II X3 and dual-core X2 models without the expense of designing new chips. Quad-core dies with one or two faulty cores can be used as triple- or dual-core processors rather than being discarded, increasing yield. Some users have managed to &quot;unlock&quot; these crippled cores, when not faulty.
* Casio&#x27;s fx-82ES scientific calculator uses the same ROM as the fx-991ES (a model with enhanced functionality), and can be made to act as the latter by strategically cutting through the epoxy on the board, and tracing the exposed solder joints using a pencil. This is also the case with the fx-83ES and the fx-85ES. 
* Apple announcing it would charge $4.99 in order to enable Wi-Fi on some devices in 2007 (fee later reduced to $1.99) and blaming it on GAAP compliance, even though their interpretation of the accounting rules as mandating a fee was contradicted by a former chief accountant of the SEC and by a member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
* Intel Upgrade Service (2010-2011), which allowed select types of processors to be upgraded via a software activation code, has also been criticized in such terms.
* Apple secretly slowed down older iPhones, in a controversy dubbed &quot;batterygate&quot;. They settled a consumer fraud lawsuit in 2020 for 113 million dollars.

==Automobiles==
Tesla limits the range on lower-end versions of the Model S in software, as well as disabling Autopilot functions if those functions weren&#x27;t purchased.

Some high-end BMW cars in the United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa have the option to pay a subscription fee for features such as heated seats, advanced cruise control, and automatic beam switching. The components and functionality already exist within the vehicle, but BMW has a software block that prevents them from being used without paying.

==Digital rights management==
Digital rights management is another example of this product differentiation strategy. Digital files are inherently capable of being copied perfectly in unlimited quantities; digital rights management aims to deter copyright infringement by using hardware or cryptographic techniques to limit copying or playback.

<text>Caria (; from Greek: Καρία, &quot;Karia&quot;; ) was a region of western Anatolia extending along the coast from mid-Ionia (Mycale) south to Lycia and east to Phrygia. The Carians were described by Herodotus as being Anatolian mainlanders and they called themselves Caria because of the name of their king. He reports the Carians themselves maintained that they were Anatolian mainlanders intensely engaged in seafaring and were akin to the Mysians and the Lydians. The Carians spoke Carian, a native Anatolian language closely related to Luwian. Also closely associated with the Carians were the Leleges, which could be an earlier name for Carians.

== Municipalities of Caria ==


Cramer&#x27;s detailed catalog of Carian towns is based entirely on ancient sources. The multiple names of towns and geomorphic features, such as bays and headlands, reveal an ethnic layering consistent with the known colonization.

=== Coastal Caria ===
Coastal Caria begins with Didyma south of Miletus, but Miletus had been placed in the pre-Ion Caria. South of it is the Iassicus Sinus (Güllük Körfezi) and the towns of Iassus and Bargylia, giving an alternative name of Bargyleticus Sinus to Güllük Körfezi, and nearby Cindye, which the Carians called Andanus. After Bargylia is Caryanda or Caryinda, and then on the Bodrum Peninsula Myndus (Mentecha or Muntecha), from Miletus. In the vicinity is Naziandus, exact location unknown.

On the tip of the Bodrum Peninsula (Cape Termerium) is Termera (Telmera, Termerea), and on the other side Ceramicus Sinus (Gökova Körfezi). It &quot;was formerly crowded with numerous towns.&quot; Halicarnassus, a Dorian Greek city, was planted there among six Carian towns: Theangela, Sibde, Medmasa, Euranium, Pedasa or Pedasum, and Telmissus. These with Myndus and Syangela (or Syagela or Souagela) constitute the eight Lelege towns. Also on the north coast of the Ceramicus Sinus is Ceramus and Bargasus.

On the south of the Ceramicus Sinus is the Carian Chersonnese, or Triopium Promontory (Cape Krio), also called Doris after the Dorian colony of Cnidus. At the base of the peninsula (Datça Peninsula) is Bybassus or Bybastus from which an earlier names, the Bybassia Chersonnese, had been derived. It was now Acanthus and Doulopolis (&quot;slave city&quot;).

South of the Carian Chersonnese is Doridis Sinus, the &quot;Gulf of Doris&quot; (Gulf of Symi), the locale of the Dorian Confederacy. There are three bays in it: Bubassius, Thymnias and Schoenus, the last enclosing the town of Hyda. In the gulf somewhere are Euthene or Eutane, Pitaeum, and an island: Elaeus or Elaeussa near Loryma. On the south shore is the Cynossema, or Onugnathos Promontory, opposite Symi.

South of there is the Rhodian Peraea, a section of the coast under Rhodes. It includes Loryma or Larymna in Oedimus Bay, Gelos, Tisanusa, the headland of Paridion, Panydon or Pandion (Cape Marmorice) with Physicus, Amos, Physca or Physcus, also called Cressa (Marmaris). Beyond Cressa is the Calbis River (Dalyan River). On the other side is Caunus (near Dalyan), with Pisilis or Pilisis and Pyrnos between.

Then follow some cities that some assign to Lycia and some to Caria: Calynda on the Indus River, Crya and Alina in the Gulf of Glaucus (Katranci Bay or the Gulf of Makri), the Glaucus River being the border. Other Carian towns in the gulf are Clydae or Lydae and Aenus.

=== Inland Caria ===

At the base of the east end of Latmus near Euromus, and near Milas where the current village Selimiye is, was the district of Euromus or Eurome, possibly Europus, formerly Idrieus and Chrysaoris (Stratonicea). The name Chrysaoris once applied to all of Caria; moreover, Euromus was originally settled from Lycia. Its towns are Tauropolis, Plarasa and Chrysaoris. These were all incorporated later into Mylasa. Connected to the latter by a sacred way are Labraunda and Sinuri. Around Stratonicea is also Lagina as well as Panamara, Tendeba and Astragon.

Further inland towards Aydın is Alabanda, noted for its marble and its scorpions, Orthosia, Coscinia or Coscinus on the upper Maeander and Alinda. To the east is the religious centre Hyllarima. At the confluence of the Maeander and the Harpasus is Harpasa (Arpaz). At the confluence of the Maeander and the Orsinus, Corsymus or Corsynus is Antioch on the Maeander and on the Orsinus in the mountains a border town with Phrygia, Gordiutichos (&quot;Gordius&#x27; Fort&quot;) near Geyre. Founded by the Leleges and called Ninoe it became Megalopolis (&quot;Big City&quot;) and Aphrodisias, sometime capital of Caria.

Other towns on the Orsinus are Timeles and Plarasa. Tabae was at various times attributed to Phrygia, Lydia and Caria and seems to have been occupied by mixed nationals. Caria also comprises the headwaters of the Indus and Eriya or Eriyus and Thabusion on the border with the small state of Cibyra.

== History ==

=== Bronze Age ===
Caria is often identified with the Bronze Age region of &quot;Karkiya&quot; (or &quot;Karkisa&quot;) known from Hittite texts, though this identification is uncertain.

===Iron Age===
==== Greek settlement ====

Caria was settled by Greek immigrants in the Early Iron Age. Their presence is attested by protogeometric pottery which appears in the area around 1100 BC, along with other markers of Greek material culture.

The coast of Caria was part of the Doric hexapolis (&quot;six-cities&quot;).

An account also cited that Aristotle claimed Caria, as a naval empire, occupied Epidaurus and Hermione and that this was confirmed when the Athenians discovered the graves of the dead from Delos. Half of it were identified as Carians based on the characteristics of the weapons they were buried with.

==== Lydian province ====
The expansionism of Lydia under Croesus (560-546 BC) incorporated Caria briefly into Lydia before it fell before the Achaemenid advance.

==== Persian satrapy ====

Caria was then incorporated into the Persian Achaemenid Empire as a satrapy (province) in 545 BC. The most important town was Halicarnassus, from where its sovereigns, the tyrants of the Lygdamid dynasty (c.520-450 BC), reigned. Other major towns were Latmus, refounded as Heracleia under Latmus, Antiochia, Myndus, Laodicea, Alinda and Alabanda. Caria participated in the Ionian Revolt (499–493 BC) against the Persian rule.


During the Second Persian invasion of Greece (480-479 BC), the cities of Caria were allies of Xerxes I and they fought at the Battle of Artemisium and the Battle of Salamis, where the Queen of Halicarnassus Artemisia commanded the contingent of 70 Carian ships. Themistocles, before the battles of Artemisium and Salamis, tried to split the Ionians and Carians from the Persian coalition. He told them to come and be on his side or not to participate at the battles, but if they were bound down by too strong a compulsion to be able to make revolt, when the battles begin, to be purposely slack. Plutarch in his work, The Parallel Lives, at The Life of Themistocles wrote that: &quot;Phanias (), writes that the mother of Themistocles was not a Thracian, but a Carian woman and her name was Euterpe (), and Neanthes () adds that she was from Halicarnassus in Caria.&quot;.

After the unsuccessful Persian invasion of Greece in 479 BC, the cities of Caria became members of the Athenian-led Delian League, but then returned to Achaemenid rule for about one century, from around 428 BC. Under Achaemenid rule, the Carian dynast Mausolus took control of neighbouring Lycia, a territory which was still held by Pixodarus as shown by the Xanthos trilingual inscription.

====Hellenistic period====
The Carians were incorporated into the Macedonian Empire following the conquests of Alexander the Great and the Siege of Halicarnassus in 334 BC.

Halicarnassus was the location of the famed Mausoleum dedicated to Mausolus, a satrap of Caria between 377–353 BC, by his wife, Artemisia II of Caria. The monument became one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and from which the Romans named any grand tomb a &quot;mausoleum.&quot;

Caria was conquered by Alexander III of Macedon in 334 BC with the help of the former queen of the land Ada of Caria who had been dethroned by the Persian Empire and actively helped Alexander in his conquest of Caria on condition of being reinstated as queen. After their capture of Caria, she declared Alexander as her heir.

=== Roman-Byzantine province ===
As part of the Roman Empire the name of Caria was still used for the geographic region. The territory administratively belonged to the province of Asia. During the administrative reforms of the 4th century this province was abolished and divided into smaller units. Caria became a separate province as part of the Diocese of Asia.

Christianity was on the whole slow to take hold in Caria. The region was not visited by St. Paul, and the only early churches seem to be those of Laodicea and Colossae (Chonae) on the extreme inland fringe of the country, which itself pursued its pagan customs. It appears that it was not until Christianity was officially adopted in Constantinople that the new religion made any real headway in Caria.

=== Dissolution under the Byzantine Empire and passage to Turkish rule ===
In the 7th century, Byzantine provinces were abolished and the new military theme system was introduced. The region corresponding to ancient Caria was captured by the Turks under the Menteşe Dynasty in the early 13th century.

There are only indirect clues regarding the population structure under the Menteşe and the parts played in it by Turkish migration from inland regions and by local conversions. The first Ottoman Empire census records indicate, in a situation not atypical for the region as a whole, a large Muslim (practically exclusively Turkish) majority reaching as high as 99% and a non-Muslim minority (practically exclusively Carian supplemented with a small Jewish community in Milas) as low as one per cent. One of the first acts of the Ottomans after their takeover was to transfer the administrative center of the region from its millenary seat in Milas to the then much smaller Muğla, which was nevertheless better suited for controlling the southern fringes of the province. Still named Menteşe until the early decades of the 20th century, the kazas corresponding to ancient Caria are recorded by sources such as G. Sotiriadis (1918) and S. Anagiostopoulou (1997) as having a Greek population averaging at around ten per cent of the total, ranging somewhere between twelve and eighteen thousand, many of them reportedly recent immigrants from the islands. Most chose to leave in 1919, before the population exchange.

=== Archaeology ===
In July 2021, archaeologists led by Abuzer Kızıl have announced the discovery of two 2,500-year-old marble statues and an inscription during excavations at the Temple of Zeus Lepsynos in Euromus. According to Abuzer Kızıl, one of the statues was naked while other was wearing armor made of leather and a short skirt. Both of the statues were depicted with a lion in their hands.

<doc id="74590" wikidata="Q487096" url="?curid=74590" title="Reus">
<text>Reus () is the capital of Baix Camp, in Camp de Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain. The area has always been an important producer of wines and spirits, and gained continental importance at the time of the Phylloxera plague. Currently it is known for its commercial activity, for being a centre for rock-climbing and as the birthplace of architect Antoni Gaudí.

==Name==

The origin of the name is a source of discussion. One of the theories is that Reus comes from the Latin word used to describe convict prisoners (&quot;reus&quot;), and as such, it would be a Roman penitentiary. Currently, the most accepted theory is that the name has Celtic roots, from the root &quot;red&quot; that originated the name &quot;redis&quot; (or &quot;reddis&quot;), that would approximately mean &quot;place in the way&quot; / &quot;place in the roads&quot;, or said alternatively, an inhabited place in a cross-road.

==History==

=== Foundation and early history ===

Around 1150 Robert d&#x27;Aguiló repopulated the region of Reus, after receiving it on 3 June 1154. On 5 June 1154 the archbishop of Tarragona gave two-thirds of Reus to Bertran de Castellet, as a castellan, with the order to build a church. On 29 June 1159, the distribution of income from ecclesiastical goods, the third of its Reus parish of Santa Maria was awarded to the camerlengo, starting the duplicity of governing the town. The camerlengo has the third of Reus parish. At this time the city was known as Redis or Reddis. The castellan Bernat de Bell-lloc gave the title of town to Reus on 3 August 1183, giving the ownership of houses and gardens, establishing a census to pay for farmland and reserving justice, but recognizing its vassalage towards the archbishopric of Tarragona. On 2 June 1186 the camerlengo Joan de Santboi confirmed the rights given by the castellan Bernard de Bell-lloc.

===Camerlengo, Popes and Archbishops of Tarragona===
In 1305 Reus revolted against the Archbishop Rodrigo Tello, who wanted the citizens of Reus to pay for rebuilding the walls of Tarragona. In 1309 the king of Aragon gave Reus the right to hold a market on Mondays. The dynasty of Bell-lloc castellans became extinct in 1327 and then Bernard de Cabrera became the new castellan, but in 1335 the castellan was sold to Pere Mulet, who lost it on 1345. Pere Mulet heirs sold their rights to Bernat d&#x27;Olzinelles in 1349. The camerlengo Pere Roger de Belfort disputed domain to the Archbishop López de Ayerbe, who sent an army that decimated the town. A second attack was repulsed. A third attack was led by military occupation of the town and Reus was sacked. The camerlengo Pere Roger de Belfort, nephew of Pope Clement VI, who was living in Avignon with his uncle, persuaded the Pope to call the archbishop of Tarragona and the Pope received a commitment for peace.
Pere Roger de Belfort gave the roses off his coat to coat of arms of the town and he later became Pope Gregory XI, he retained the title as a camerlengo of Reus, so the coat of arms was crowned and adorned with, a papal tiara and the keys of St. Peter.
===Catalan Revolt war and the Archduke Charles===
At the beginning of the Catalan Revolt war the town had 1200 houses, but reduced to 800 by the end of the war. On 16 December 1640 was declared an enemy of the fatherland by the Parliament and confiscated the goods of the inhabitants, as a response to the inactive participation in the war. In 1641 it was occupied by the French general La Mothe.

Reus was loyal to Philip V until 1705, but this year, under the direction of Joan Nebot, revolted in favor of the Archduke Charles. On 3 July 1706 the Archduke Charles came to the town. In 1707 fell shortly to the Bourbons, but in 1709 Reus surrendered to the Spanish and French Bourbons. In 1710 Reus returned again to the field of Archduke Charles. On 5 June 1712 the wife of the Archduke, Elisabeth Christine, gave the title of imperial city to Reus. In 1713 Reus was occupied finally by the Bourbon.

===Growth in the eighteenth century===
In the eighteenth century Reus had phenomenal growth and became the second city of the principality of Catalonia. The walls were completely demolished in 1766. The town developed the textile trade and the liquor trade. In this last contribution was the first center, the others were London and Paris. From this time it&#x27;s the popular sentence &quot;Reus, Paris and London”, because Reus was one of the centers of the liquor marquet. The construction of a canal between Reus and Salou, proposed by Pere Sunyer was granted in 1805, but it was stopped because of the French War. At this time Reus had consulates in the United States, Liguria, England, Holland, Sweden, Ragusa, Denmark, Sicily, the Papal States, France, Portugal, Naples and Prussia.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

In 1854 the Reus Gas Company was founded. In 1856 the railway between Reus and Tarragona was built. In 1884 the Catalan Association of Reus was founded and in 1893 was celebrated the Assembly of the Unió Catalana. In 1886 Pau Font de Rubinat founded the Catalan newspaper &quot;Lo Somatent&quot;. In 1895 the phylloxera killed big areas of vineyards in the region of Reus and many of these areas switched to growing hazelnuts.

In 1931 Reus voted for the republic. In 1936 Francisco Franco bombed the city until his rebel army occupied the city on 15 January 1939, starting with the dictatorship of Franco until his death in 1975.

The first democratic mayor after Franco was Carles Martí Massagué, lawyer of Reus. In 1983 Anton Borrell Marcó was the new mayor of the city, but he died in a car accident on the road from Reus to Cambrils, then his successor was Juan Maria Roig. After him, Josep Abelló Padró was the mayor until 1999, replaced by Lluís Miquel Pérez Segura, who occupied the position until 2011, when the current mayor, Carles Pellicer i Punyed, started.

==Demography==
Reus was for long the second city of Catalonia with a population of 14,440 in 1787 and 27,257 in 1860. It was overtaken by Tarragona and Lleida between 1900 and 1930. The population barely grew between 1920 and 1930, with 30,266 and 35,950 inhabitants, respectively. From then, the population growth has been substantial, from 41,014 inhabitants in 1960 to 108,100 inhabitants that the city has as of the end of 2008. Immigration, mostly from Marrakesh, has been a portion of that increase. About 6% are Muslim and 8% from other religions.

According to the 2006 official Spanish census (source: Instituto Nacional de Estadística), Reus is the 9th most populous city in Catalonia and the 59th in Spain.

==Climate==
Reus has a hot-summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot; on the Köppen climate classification), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;). It has mild, moderately dry winters and hot, dry, moderately muggy summers. Autumn is the rainiest season of the year, especially due to the cold drop that occur in the months of September and October.

==Economy==

During the 19th and 20th centuries Reus became known as one of the world&#x27;s major centers of liquor production, and was home to over 30 producers of vermouth. Today Reus is home to major exporters of vermouth including Yzaguirre, Iris (Muller), Miró, and Fot-Li.

==Festivities==

The principal Reus festivity is &quot;Sant Pere&quot; on 29 June, declared of National Touristic Interest. One of the most characteristic and popular acts of these festivities is the so-called &quot;tronada&quot;, which is a series of 29 little mortars &quot;masclets&quot; with bangers interleaved, arranged linearly around the &quot;Mercadal&quot; square (where the city hall is located), united by a hand craft gunpowder line. This line ends in a square shape in front of the city hall, with more bangers and 9 more &quot;masclets&quot;. Also, on September 25, the &quot;Mare de Déu de la Misericòrdia&quot; is held.

Other noteworthy festivities are the Carnival and the &quot;Anada a l&#x27;Antiga&quot; towards Salou. Most of the neighborhoods have their own festivities.

Besides the major festivities, Reus holds many festivals, for example &quot;Cos&quot;, a festival dedicated to mime, or &quot;El Trapezi&quot;, a festival with circus spectacles. In every odd numbered year the Reus Institut Municipal d’Accio Cultural presents the &quot;Biennals Internacionals de Fotografia Medalla Gaudi&quot;. This bi-annual exhibition features fine art photographers from around the world working in Alternative Photographic Processes (such as Platinum Printing, Gum Dichromate, Etc.). At each Biennal they award the Medalla Gaudi award to a select few artists and purchase their work for the Institut Municipal d’Accio Cultural&#x27;s permanent collection.

The airport also receives major charter flights from the United Kingdom. Barcelona Airport is another airport which serves the area for those destinations not served by Reus Airport.

==Transport==
The city is served by Reus Airport.

==Flag of Reus==
The first flag of Reus was in use from 1774 to 1943. The flag was dark red with the city arms in the centre.

In 1943 the flag was changed because the color red seemed to be associated with the left, defeated in the civil war (1936–39). As the historic city arms were argent with a heraldic rose the new flag was white with a heraldic rose in the center. Minor changes to the rose in the flag were made after 1943.

Currently the rose has a new version, taken from the city emblem. The emblem itself has official status. This presumably also applies to the flag, but this has not been confirmed by the local government.
