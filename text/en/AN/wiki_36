<text>Sarnia is a city in Lambton County, Ontario, Canada. It had a 2021 population of 72,047, and is the largest city on Lake Huron. Sarnia is located on the eastern bank of the junction between the Upper and Lower Great Lakes, where Lake Huron flows into the St. Clair River in the Southwestern Ontario region, which forms the Canada–United States border, directly across from Port Huron, Michigan.

The site&#x27;s natural harbour first attracted the French explorer La Salle. He named the site &quot;The Rapids&quot; on 23 August 1679, when he had horses and men pull his 45-ton barque &quot;Le Griffon&quot; north against the nearly four-knot current of the St. Clair River. This was the first time that a vessel other than a canoe or other oar-powered vessel had sailed into Lake Huron, and La Salle&#x27;s voyage was germinal in the development of commercial shipping on the Great Lakes. Located in the natural harbour, the Sarnia port remains an important centre for lake freighters and oceangoing ships carrying cargoes of grain and petroleum products. The natural port and the salt caverns that exist in the surrounding areas, together with the oil discovered in nearby Oil Springs in 1858, led to the dramatic growth of the petroleum industry in this area. Because Oil Springs was the first place in Canada and North America to drill commercially for oil, the knowledge that was acquired there resulted in oil drillers from Sarnia travelling the world teaching other enterprises and nations how to drill for oil.

The complex of refining and chemical companies is called &quot;Chemical Valley&quot; and located south of downtown Sarnia. In 2011 the city had the highest level of particulates air pollution of any Canadian city, but it has since dropped to rank 30th in this hazard. About 60 percent of the particulate matter comes from industries and polluters in the neighbouring United States.

Lake Huron is cooler than the air in summer and warmer than the air in winter; therefore, it moderates Sarnia&#x27;s humid continental climate, making temperature extremes of hot and cold less evident. In the winter, Sarnia occasionally experiences lake-effect snow from Arctic air blowing across the warmer waters of Lake Huron and condensing to form snow squalls over land.

==History==
===Name===
The name &quot;Sarnia&quot; is Latin for Guernsey, a British Channel Island. In 1829 Sir John Colborne, a former governor of Guernsey, was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. In this capacity, he visited two small settlements in 1835 that had been laid out on the shores of Lake Huron. One of these, named &quot;The Rapids&quot;, consisted then of 44 taxpayers, nine frame houses, four log houses, two brick dwellings, two taverns and three stores. The villagers wanted to change its name but were unable to agree on an alternative. The English settlers favoured the name &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;, and the ethnic Scottish favoured &quot;New Glasgow&quot;.

Sir John Colborne suggested Port Sarnia. On 4 January 1836, the name was formally adopted by a vote of 26 to 16, and Colborne also named the nearby village Moore after British military hero Sir John Moore. Sarnia adopted the nickname &quot;The Imperial City&quot; on 7 May 1914 because of the visit of Canada&#x27;s Governor General, the Duke of Connaught, and his daughter Princess Patricia.

===Early history===
Ethnic French colonists, who came from Detroit, were the first European colonizers of what became Sarnia in about 1807–1810; their role is marked by a historic plaque installed by the Ontario Heritage Society. They were fur traders with the Huron and Three Fires Confederacy. At this time, the French Jesuits also established a mission near the Huron village on the river&#x27;s east bank. Later, the men established farms, attracted other settlers, and stimulated growth in the area.

The township was surveyed in 1829, and in the early 1830s, a wave of Scottish immigrants settled in the area. They became dominant as English speakers and, for decades, claimed to have founded the city.

Port Sarnia expanded throughout the 19th century; on 19 June 1856, Parliament passed &quot;An Act to Incorporate the Town of Sarnia,&quot; and the name Port Sarnia was officially changed to Sarnia, effective 1 January 1857. The Act mentioned 1,000 inhabitants in three wards. The important lumber industry was based on the wealth of virgin timber in the area, at a time of development around the Great Lakes. Lumber was especially in demand in the booming US cities of Chicago and Detroit.

The discovery of oil in nearby Oil Springs in 1858 by James Miller Williams, and the arrival of the Great Western Railway in 1858 and the Grand Trunk Railway in 1859, all stimulated Sarnia&#x27;s growth. The rail lines were later linked directly to the United States by the opening of the St. Clair Tunnel under the St. Clair River at Sarnia in 1890 by the Grand Trunk Railway. This was the first railroad tunnel ever constructed under a river. The tunnel was an engineering marvel in its day, achieved through the development of original techniques for excavating in a compressed air environment.

In 1860 the Prince of Wales met the Chief of the Ojibways of Garden River, with 75 indigenious leaders, at Sarnia and gave them 1860 Queen Victoria Peace medals with the Prince of Wales logo engraved on the obverse.

===20th century to present===
Canada Steamship Lines formed in 1913 from many previous companies that plied the waters of the St. Clair River. One of these companies was Northwest Transportation Company of Sarnia, founded in 1870. By 20 April 1914, when Parliament passed &quot;An Act to Incorporate the City of Sarnia&quot;, the population had grown to 10,985 in six wards. Sarnia officially became a city as of 7 May 1914.


Sarnia&#x27;s grain elevator, which in the early 21st century is the 15th-largest operating in Canada, was built in 1927 after the dredging of Sarnia Harbour to allow access to larger ships. Two years later, grain shipments had become an important part of Sarnia&#x27;s economy.

The grain elevator rises above the harbour, and next to it is the slip for the numerous bulk carriers and other ships that are part of the contemporary shipping industry. They include vessels from all over the world. The waterway between Detroit and Sarnia is one of the world&#x27;s busiest, as indicated by the average of of shipping that annually travelled the river going in both directions during the period 1993–2002. Lake freighters and oceangoing ships, which are known as &quot;salties&quot;, pass up and down the river at the rate of about one every seven minutes during the shipping season.

The Paul M. Tellier Tunnel, which was named after the retired president of CN in 2004, was bored and began operation in 1995. It accommodates double-stacked rail cars and is located next to the original tunnel, which has been sealed.

A petroleum industry was established in the Sarnia area in 1858, and in 1942, Polymer Corporation manufactured synthetic rubber there during World War II, enhancing Sarnia&#x27;s notability as a petrochemical centre. During the Cold War, the United States Government included Sarnia on its list of possible targets for a Soviet nuclear strike because of its petrochemical industry.

On 1 January 1991, Sarnia and the neighbouring town of Clearwater (formerly Sarnia Township) were amalgamated as the new city of Sarnia-Clearwater. The amalgamation was initially slated to include the village of Point Edward, although that village&#x27;s residents resisted. They were eventually permitted to remain independent of the city. On 1 January 1992, the city reverted to the name Sarnia.

Sarnia&#x27;s population continued to grow from 1961 to 1991, with a 1991 population of 74,376. In 2001, the population had declined by approximately 3,000. Since 2001, Sarnia&#x27;s population has been growing slowly, with a 2011 population count of 72,366. An April 2010 report &quot;Sarnia-Lambton&#x27;s Labour Market&quot; states: &quot;Large petrochemical companies are the community&#x27;s main economic drivers. Over the recent past, several plants have shut down,[sic] and of those still in operation, increased automation and outsourcing has led to significantly fewer workers.&quot;

These shutdowns and the resulting loss of jobs, and therefore of population as workers search for employment elsewhere, will contribute to a general decline as forecast by an August 2011 study. It projects a 17% decline in population over the next twenty-five years. The Monteith-Brown study cited outlines a plan for restructuring the city based on hybrid zoning areas, which will bring work opportunities closer to the neighbourhoods where people live. The City of Sarnia and Lambton County are also implementing an economic development plan with an emphasis on bio-industries and renewable energy.

In 2020, Sarnia began to experience a &quot;soaring murder rate&quot;. Sarnia had one homicide from 2016 to 2019 and eight homicides from 2020 to 2022. The &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; reported that the increased murder rate was drug-related, with local youth unable to find opportunities for themselves in the city.

==Geography==
Sarnia is located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron at its extreme southern point, where it flows into the St. Clair River. Most of the surrounding area is flat, and the elevation ranges from above sea level. The soil mainly comprises clay. Despite this high percentage of clay, the soil is remarkably rich for cultivation.

===Neighbourhoods===
Wiltshire Park, Woodland, Oak Acres, Wees Beach, Oakwood Corners, Woodrow Shores, and Blackwell are part of the North End of Sarnia, which begins immediately north of Ontario Highway 402 and terminates at the shore of Lake Huron. Blackwell, Bright&#x27;s Grove, and the western part of Huron Heights are in the northeast part along the shores of Lake Huron. Coronation Park, Fourth Line Heritage Park, College Park, Lucasville, Bunyan, Froomfield, The Tree Streets, Mitton Village, and Sherwood Village are some of the neighbourhoods south of the highway.

The village of Blue Water was built to house workers and their families in Chemical Valley during the construction of Polymer Corporation; at one point, it had nearly 3,000 residents. In 1961, all the residents were relocated, mostly to the North End, to make way for the expansion of the chemical industry. The village was demolished, and all that remains is a historical marker at the corner of Vidal Street and Huron Boulevard. This neighbourhood was largely forgotten until historian Lorraine Williams wrote two books about it. She was instrumental in gaining approval for the historical plaque.

===Climate===
Sarnia has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;), verging on the hot summer subtype &quot;Dfa&quot;. Winters are cold with a few short-lasting Arctic air masses that dip far enough south and bring with them daily high temperatures below . Sarnia, while not quite located in the southwestern Ontario snowbelt, sometimes receives large quantities of lake-effect snow. Sarnia averages of snow per year, while London, inland and to the east, averages .

The moderating effect of Lake Huron which Sarnia has a long shoreline on its north side, and to a lesser extent other nearby Great Lakes ensure seasonal lag similar to other lakeside locations over much of Southern Ontario. This gives Sarnia a noticeably milder period following Summer and delaying onset of the first frost in the Fall. Conversely, cooler average daytime temperatures tend to prevail for longer after winter breaks, through the late Spring and early Summer as compared to further inland. 
Daily lows of less than occur an average of 29 days a year, and less than , only average two days a year. 
Summers are warm with typically humid conditions. Humidex readings and Dew Points can be very high at times from late May to late September. Sarnia has the second greatest number of high humidex days at or above (with 23.16 days on average per year) and humidex days at or above (with 61.20 days on average per year) in Canada, ranking after Windsor, Ontario. Thunderstorms are frequent and can occasionally become severe from April to September. Destructive weather is very rare in the area but has occurred, such as the tornado event of 1953.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Sarnia had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As of the 2021 Census, Sarnia was 86.2% White, 8.3% visible minorities, and 5.5% Indigenous. The largest visible minority groups in the city are South Asians (2.7%), Black Canadians (1.6%), and Latin Americans (0.9%). In 2021, 87.5% of Sarnians called English their mother tongue, 2.2% listed French, and 3.4% said another language was their mother tongue. 1.1% listed both English and a non-official language as their mother tongue.

The median age in Sarnia is 46.0 as of 2021, which is older than the Canadian median of 41.6, indicative of Sarnia&#x27;s aging population.

In 2021, 56.8% of residents were Christian, down from 69.5% in 2011. 25.2% of the population was Catholic, 21.1% were Protestant, and 6.6% were Christians of unspecified denomination. All other Christian denominations/Christian-related traditions comprised 3.9% of the population. 39.5% of residents were nonreligious or secular, up from 27.9% in 2011. All other religions (or spiritual beliefs) comprised 3.6% of residents. The largest non-Christian religions were Islam (1.2%) and Hinduism (1.1%).

The median income for all persons 15 years old or older in Sarnia in 2015 was $33,833, while the median family income was $86,654, in line with the averages for Ontario as a whole, at $33,539 and $91,089, respectively. In 2021, the median price of a house in Sarnia was $430,000, compared to the $887,290 of Ontario as a whole.

==Economy==

In its March 2011 Labour Market Report, the Sarnia-Lambton Workforce Development Board states that: &quot;Even though employment in both the petrochemical and agricultural industries has declined significantly in recent years, these two industries remain central drivers of the Sarnia Lambton economy.&quot;

When World War II threatened tropical sources of natural latex for rubber, Sarnia was selected as the site to spearhead the development of synthetic petroleum-based rubbers for war materials. Polymer Corporation was built by Dow Chemical at the request of the Government of Canada. Large pipelines bring Alberta oil to Sarnia, where oil refining and petrochemical production have become mainstays of the city&#x27;s economy. Shell Canada, Imperial Oil, and Suncor Energy (Sunoco) operate refineries in Sarnia. Large salt beds found under the city became a source of chlorine and other significant ingredients which contributed to the success of Chemical Valley. Chemical companies operating in Sarnia include NOVA Chemicals, Bayer (Lanxess and H.C. Starck), Cabot Corporation, and Ethyl Corporation.

Dow Chemical ceased operations at its Sarnia site in 2009, with the plants after that decommissioned and the land sold to neighbouring TransAlta Energy Corporation. TransAlta produces power and steam for industry, and is the largest natural gas co-generation plant in Canada. It has created the Bluewater Energy Park on the former Dow site. Dow returned to Sarnia in 2019, when it took ownership of a former Dupont production site on Albert Street in Corunna that modifies polyethylene and polypropylene.

Lanxess produces more than of butyl rubber annually at its Sarnia location and is the sole producer of regulatory-approved, food-grade butyl rubber, used in the manufacture of chewing gum. Within the boundaries of its Sarnia plant Lanxess has also created the Bio-industrial Park Sarnia.

Chemical Valley and the surrounding area are home to 62 facilities and refineries. These industrial complexes are the heart of Sarnia&#x27;s infrastructure and economy. They directly employ nearly 8,000 and contribute to almost 45,000 additional jobs in the area. In 1971, the Canadian government deemed this area so important to the economic development of the country that it printed an image of a Sarnia Oil Refinery on the reverse of the Canadian $10 note. The huge industrial area is the cause of significant air and water pollution. The Canada Wide Daily Standard for airborne particulate matter and ozone pollution, regulation PM2.5, is 30 micrograms per cubic metre. Forty-five percent of this particulate air pollution in Sarnia comes from Chemical Valley, and the rest drifts over the St. Clair River from the neighbouring United States in the form of what is known as &quot;Transboundary Air Pollution&quot;.

Sarnia is the location of Enbridge&#x27;s Sarnia Photovoltaic Power Plant. The facility underwent a full commercial operation in December 2009, with 20 MW of power. , the plant was the largest photovoltaic (PV) solar power generation facility in the world, putting out 97 MW.

The Western University Research Park, Sarnia-Lambton Campus was established in 2003 by the University of Western Ontario as a joint initiative with the County of Lambton and the City of Sarnia. The park is also the location of the Bioindustrial Innovation Centre, Canada&#x27;s centre for the commercialization of industrial biotechnology.

In 2015, BioAmber opened a $141 million plant that manufactures of succinic acid per year, a chemical used to make plastics, lubricants, paint, cosmetics, food additives, and other products. BioAmber plans to construct a second site and may build it in Sarnia. Solutions4CO2 is developing a demonstration facility at Bluewater Energy Park. This company captures waste gas/water streams to process into value-added co-products, pharmaceutical drugs, and biofuels. PlantForm Corporation, a Canadian biotech startup company producing ultra-low-cost therapeutic antibody drugs, opened an office at the Western University Research Park in 2011. At the same Park, from the summer of 2012 to the summer of 2016, KmX Corporation operated a pilot plant to produce membranes that filter wastewater from industrial processes. KmX production in Sarnia has since moved to Ottawa and Edmonton.

===Retail and hospitality===
Sarnia has one large mall, Lambton Mall, with 72 stores. The mall, along with several smaller shopping centers, stores, and hotels, is the primary shopping area.

==Arts and culture==
===Music, theatre, and arts===
The International Symphony Orchestra plays at the Imperial Theatre for an annual season lasting from September to April. In addition to symphonic concerts, the Imperial Theatre offers year-round dramatic productions; Former Max Webster frontman Kim Mitchell has returned to his hometown on occasion to play a concert, including his visit in 2008 for Sarnia&#x27;s popular Ribfest. In this competition, local amateur chefs share their recipes for barbecued ribs and compete against each other. Canadian composer and music educator Raymond Murray Schafer was born in Sarnia and developed his radical schizophonia techniques there.

The Sarnia Bayfest (which was preceded by the &quot;Festival by the Bay&quot;) was an annual concert festival that featured big-name rock and country bands. Musicians and groups such as Aerosmith, KISS, Keith Urban, Jon Bon Jovi and Rascal Flatts have played at the event. Financial problems caused the event&#x27;s cancellation in 2013. In the summer of 2017, a new festival called Bluewater Borderfest enjoyed a successful inaugural event.

Besides the single museum in Sarnia proper, six other local museums document Sarnia&#x27;s history, including its legacy as the home of the North American oil industry. Gallery Lambton offers 12 annual art exhibitions. In 2012 the Judith and Norman Alex Art Gallery opened. It is an international Category A art gallery, featuring exhibitions of Canadian art history, including paintings from the Group of Seven.

In 2015, the South Western International Film Festival was launched at the city&#x27;s Imperial Theatre.

During the Christmas season, the city of Sarnia presents the annual &quot;Celebration of Lights&quot; in Centennial Park. The event was created in 1984 by Wills Rawana and a committee funded by the retail chain Hudson&#x27;s Bay, and the national telecommunications company Telus. From modest beginnings, the event has garnered numerous awards as it has grown, including second place in the 2002 Canadian Government&#x27;s Canada WinterLights competition. The celebration was incorporated in its national prizewinning year and is now run by a voluntary Board of Directors.

==Attractions==

There are more than 100 parks in Sarnia, the largest being Canatara Park, which covers more than along the shore of Lake Huron. Canatara is an Ojibwe word that means &quot;Blue Water&quot;. The park was opened in 1933. Within the park is Lake Chipican, a haven for many different species of birds on their migration routes. Most years, birdwatchers recognize around 150 species. The park also maintains a Children&#x27;s Animal Farm as part of Sarnia&#x27;s commitment to wildlife. The annual &quot;Christmas on the Farm&quot; weekend event held at the Farm in early December is a popular community event enjoyed by families. Canatara Park is one of the first parks in southern Ontario to feature an outdoor fitness equipment installation.

The largest recreational park in Sarnia is Germain Park, which incorporates five baseball diamonds, four soccer fields, an outdoor pool, and the Community Gardens. As a memorial to Canadian aviators who died in World War II, one of the remaining Canadair Sabres in Canada is on display in the park.

Centennial Park was opened on 1 July Dominion Day holiday in 1967 as part of Canada&#x27;s centenary celebrations. The City of Sarnia decided in 2013 to close much of Centennial Park, after the discovery of toxic levels of lead and asbestos in the soil. After years of remediation, the park was reopened in 2017.

Howard Watson Trail is a former railway line that passes through a combination of urban and rural areas. This linear park is managed by a volunteer committee and spans through wooded areas and alongside ponds. Benches are available along the path as well as washroom facilities. The path is open year-round: bicycling, running, and dog walking are popular activities in the summer. Snowshoeing and cross-country skiing can be enjoyed on snowy days. Access to Lake Huron is available at Blackwell Side Road.

Sarnia connects to the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail, which stretches over along the Canadian shores of Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, Lake Huron and the Niagara, Detroit, and St. Lawrence rivers. The Great Lakes Waterfront Trail connects 114 communities and hundreds of parks and natural areas, including wetlands, forests, and beaches.

Sarnia has one museum within its city limits, known as &quot;Stones &#x27;N Bones&quot;, which houses over 6,000 exhibits. The collection includes rocks, artifacts, fossils, and bones from around the world.

The former Discovery House Museum has been converted into a hospice. This historic house, built between 1869 and 1875, is recognized as a testament to Victorian Era construction.

The city&#x27;s sandy freshwater beaches are a popular tourist attraction, while the sheltered harbour houses marinas for recreational sailing. Since 1925, the Mackinac race from Sarnia/Port Huron to Mackinac Island at the north end of the lake has been the highlight of the sailing season, drawing more than 3,000 sailors each year.

Sarnia&#x27;s fresh-cut potato fries are another popular tourist attraction. Thousands of visitors visit the chip trucks parked under the Blue Water Bridge annually. In 2012, during construction along the waterfront, Sarnia officials created a special detour to enable visitors to reach the chip trucks. Realizing the popularity of Sarnia&#x27;s chip trucks, the Ontario Medical Association includes them in a campaign to have fries and other junk food labelled for being dangerous in the same manner as cigarettes.

==Sports==
Sarnia is home to the Sarnia Sting, a junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League. Dino Ciccarelli, a former NHL player, was a part owner of the team. Former Sting player Steven Stamkos was selected first overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning, and was followed by Nail Yakupov in 2012. Sarnia is also home to the Sarnia Legionnaires ice hockey team, which plays in the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League. The team is the successor to the Sarnia Legionnaires (1954–1970), who won five Western Jr. &#x27;B&#x27; championships and four Sutherland Cups during 16 seasons in the Ontario Hockey Association.

Sarnia has a successful tradition in Canadian football. As members of the Ontario Rugby Football Union, the local team Sarnia Imperials twice won the Grey Cup in 1934 and 1936. The modern Sarnia Imperials are a semi-professional team playing in the Northern Football Conference.

Mike Ceresia is a Sarnia native. He won four IRF World Racquetball Championships and multiple silver medals between 1988 and 2002.

At the federal level, Sarnia is located within the Sarnia—Lambton federal electoral district, which in 2019 is represented by Conservative Marilyn Gladu.

Over the past 50 years, Sarnia&#x27;s voters have been moderate. The party affiliation of its Members of Parliament, both provincial and federal, has swung back and forth largely between the Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties (a New Democrat was elected in their 1990 provincial wave).

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
The Blue Water Bridge links Sarnia and its neighbouring village of Point Edward to the city of Port Huron in the United States. It spans the St. Clair River, which connects Lake Huron to Lake St. Clair. The bridge&#x27;s original three-lane span opened in 1938, was twinned on 22 July 1997, making the bridge the fourth-busiest border crossing in Ontario.

The Blue Water Bridge border crossing makes use of both the NEXUS and the Free and Secure Trade (FAST) program. Linking Highway 402 with the American Interstate 94 (I-94) and I-69, the bridge forms part of the NAFTA Superhighway. It is one of the most important gateways on the north–south truck routes.

Public transportation within the City of Sarnia, including conventional bus transit, transportation of people with disabilities, transportation support for major events, and charter services, is provided by Sarnia Transit.

<text>Interstate 97 (I-97) is a north-south Interstate Highway in the eastern United States. It runs entirely within Anne Arundel County, Maryland, for from U.S. Route 50/U.S. Route 301 (US 50/US 301) in Parole near Annapolis north to I-695 and I-895B in Brooklyn Park near Baltimore. The interstate is the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis. I‑97 connects Annapolis with Baltimore/Washington International Airport and links the northern Anne Arundel County communities of Crownsville, Millersville, Severna Park, Glen Burnie, and Ferndale. It is currently the second shortest primary Interstate Highway in the country after the unfinished I-87 in North Carolina.

I-97 was constructed along the corridor of Maryland Route 3 (MD 3) between Millersville and Ferndale and MD 178 between Parole and Millersville. From Millersville to south of Glen Burnie, the interstate closely follows the former course of MD 3, which was built in the late 1910s and early 1920s and expanded to a divided highway in the late 1950s. North of there, the highway follows the Glen Burnie Bypass, a freeway built in the mid-1950s. The segment of I-97 from Millersville to Crownsville originated as a two-lane portion of MD 32 in the early 1970s. The interstate was introduced in 1979 after the state of Maryland successfully obtained interstate mileage for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway from the federal government. The state decided to build the highway along I-97&#x27;s current corridor rather than along the MD 2 corridor, which has partial freeway access via MD 10.

Construction on I-97 began in the late 1980s with new construction from US 50/US 301 to Crownsville. The Crownsville–Millersville segment of MD 32 was expanded and incorporated into the interstate and the MD 3–MD 32 junction was upgraded. The portion of the MD 3 corridor from Millersville to south of Glen Burnie was upgraded on the spot to interstate highway standards in the early 1990s, after which MD 3 was truncated at Millersville. I-97&#x27;s interchange with I-695 was rebuilt in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Glen Burnie Bypass was upgraded and expanded to six lanes in the mid-1990s. The complex process included reconstruction of several interchanges; the last interchange to be reconstructed was upgraded in the mid-2000s.

==Route description==

I-97 begins at US 50/US 301 (John Hanson Highway), which run concurrently with unsigned I-595, on the edge of the community of Parole west of Annapolis. The freeways meet at a semi-directional T interchange; the ramp from I-97 to eastbound US 50/northbound US 301 merges with a collector–distributor road that extends east to that freeway&#x27;s interchange with MD 665 (Aris T. Allen Boulevard). I-97 heads northwest as a four-lane freeway. The freeway crosses over MD 450 (Defense Highway) and passes along the south and west sides of Crownsville, where it crosses several tributaries of the Bacon Ridge Branch of the South River. North of Crownsville, I-97 has a partial interchange that comprises a pair of long ramps to MD 178 (Generals Highway); the interchange allows access from southbound I-97 to MD 178 and from the state highway to the northbound Interstate. I-97 gains an extra lane in each direction from the MD 178 ramps; those extra lanes split off at the freeway&#x27;s partial interchange with the eastern end of MD 32 just north of Millersville. The Interstate curves northeast and has a complementary partial interchange with the northern end of MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway). The two state highways meet each other at a six-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange immediately to the west of I-97&#x27;s sweeping curve, which facilitates all movements between the three highways.
I-97 continues north as a six-lane freeway and is closely paralleled on the east by Veterans Highway on the western edge of Severna Park. The highways cross the Severn River within Severn Run Natural Environment Area before they diverge slightly at the Interstate&#x27;s partial cloverleaf interchange with Benfield Boulevard; access from northbound I-97 to the crossroad is via Veterans Highway. I-97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each other to the latter highway&#x27;s northern end at I-97&#x27;s partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business (MD 3 Bus.; Robert Crain Highway) and New Cut Road. The interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to northbound Veterans Highway just south of its intersection with MD 3 Bus. The freeway continues north along the west side of Glen Burnie and meets MD 174 (Quarterfield Road) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and MD 100 at a combination interchange that has flyover exit ramps from both directions of I-97.

I-97 temporarily gains two extra lanes in each direction between MD 100 and its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 176 (Dorsey Road). Access from the southbound Interstate to MD 176 is via MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), which forms part of the Airport Loop surrounding Baltimore/Washington International Airport. I-97 continues through Ferndale, where it crosses over the Glen Burnie branch of the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)&#x27;s Baltimore Light RailLink immediately before the highway&#x27;s four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (Baltimore–Annapolis Boulevard), which provides access to the transit line&#x27;s terminal station, Glen Burnie station. I-97&#x27;s final interchange is with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The Interstate crosses the Cabin Branch of Curtis Creek within the interchange, which includes a flyover ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695; that ramp and the one from eastbound I-695 to I-97 merge on the inside of the two carriageways of the beltway. The Interstate drops to four lanes and reaches its northern terminus just north of the loop ramp from westbound I-695 to I-97 in Brooklyn Park. The highway continues north as I-895A, a pair of ramps that merge with I-895B, the spur from I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) to MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway). The continuation from I-97 includes a ramp to westbound I-695 that allows access to the beltway&#x27;s interchange with MD 648.

I-97 does not have an official name. However, the Interstate is dedicated to John A. Cade, who served the area around Severna Park in the Maryland Senate from 1974 to his 1996 death and who worked to secure funding for the highway. The Maryland General Assembly passed a dedication bill in 1998, and the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) installed a pair of signs noting the dedication in Millersville and near Parole. Like all Interstate Highways, I-97 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length. I-97 is the shortest completed two-digit mainline Interstate (I-87 in North Carolina is shorter, but is still under construction) and officially the only intracounty two-digit Interstate in the contiguous US (Interstate 11 is also currently intracounty, but intended to extend much further when finished.)

==History==
===Predecessor highways===
The first modern highway along the path of what is now I-97 followed the corridor from New Cut Road to south of the intersection of MD 178 and Veterans Highway at Dorrs Corner. This highway was intended as a second route from Glen Burnie to Annapolis to complement the highway along the east side of the Severn River; this western route later became known as General&#x27;s Highway, a name still applied to its MD 178 portion. Construction of this highway was underway by 1919. The new highway was completed as a gravel road from New Cut Road to north of Benfield and as a concrete road through Benfield and across Severn Run to near Dorrs Corner by 1921. In 1922, this highway was designated part of Robert Crain Highway, a new highway to connect the Baltimore area with Southern Maryland. The Glen Burnie–Dorrs Corner portion of the new highway was reconstructed and completed as a concrete road from Glen Burnie south through Millersville by 1923. Robert Crain Highway became part of MD 3 in 1927 and then US 301 in 1939 when the US Route was extended from Virginia to Baltimore. MD 3 was reconstructed in 1933 and 1934. The reconstruction eliminated several dangerous curves, particularly near the Severn River, and expanded the highway from a width of . Veterans Highway follows much of that early 1930s course.
The next portion of I-97 predecessor highway was built as the four-lane Glen Burnie Bypass from Robert Crain Highway and New Cut Road north to the Baltimore Beltway. Construction on the four-lane freeway began in August 1954 with construction of several bridges over or for the highway; these bridges were completed in 1955 and 1956. The dual roadways and interchange ramps from the southern end of the bypass to MD 648 were constructed starting in March 1955; the concrete-surfaced highway was completed in February 1957. The northernmost portion of the bypass, including the adjacent portion of the Baltimore Beltway, was constructed between December 1955 and September 1957. US 301 was moved onto the bypass and the adjacent portion of the Beltway when the projects were completed in 1957. The small portion of I-97 north of the Beltway was added to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel project as a direct connection between the Glen Burnie Bypass and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway&#x27;s southern approach from MD 2 in 1955. This segment was completed and opened with the tunnel and its approach highways in November 1957. The Glen Burnie Bypass was constructed with five interchanges: a partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 3 Bus. and New Cut Road; a tighter four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 174; a diamond interchange at MD 176; the current four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 648; and a half-cloverleaf interchange at I-695 allowing full access between the Glen Burnie Bypass and beltway but no access between the beltway and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway.

US 301 was expanded to a divided highway from the southern end of the Glen Burnie Bypass to Benfield in 1956 and 1957. The highway&#x27;s second set of lanes, including a new bridge across the Severn River, was constructed and the existing roadway was reconstructed from Benfield to Millersville between 1957 and 1960. The second set of lanes was built on the west side of what became a very wide median, which allowed businesses to site themselves in the median between the northbound and southbound lanes. During construction of the Benfield–Millersville stretch, US 301 was relocated to its present course from Bowie to the Eastern Shore and replaced with MD 3. A pair of ramps between the Glen Burnie Bypass and MD 177&#x27;s freeway southern bypass of Glen Burnie (now MD 100) were constructed between 1963 and 1965. The first section of highway south of Dorrs Corner was built between 1969 and 1972 as a two-lane segment of MD 32 from east of Odenton to MD 178 in Crownsville. The highway used what are now the ramps of I-97&#x27;s partial interchange with MD 178 and had a five-ramp interchange with MD 3 in Millersville that lacked access from northbound MD 3 to eastbound MD 32 and from westbound MD 32 to southbound MD 3.

===Interstate designation and construction===

Despite the existence or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis, a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed as early as 1956 in the form of the Arundel Expressway, which would relieve congestion on MD 2. The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978. MD 10 was proposed to continue south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50, but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991. The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. However, the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore–Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard–Cramer amendment, which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred. Much of the mileage of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the Washington, D.C. area.

With Interstate funding assured, MDSHA commissioned the Baltimore–Annapolis Transportation Corridor Study in 1973 to figure out, among other things, the best route for the Baltimore–Annapolis Interstate. The study discovered a western route following the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors would be less disruptive and require fewer acquisitions of homes and businesses compared to an extension of the Arundel Expressway south along the MD 2 corridor. In June 1979, MDSHA announced plans for I-97. The original route numbering plan, which was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) at its November 1975 meeting, was for I-97 to include its current route plus US 50 from Parole west to I-95 (Capital Beltway). That proposal included two auxiliary Interstate highways. I-197 would follow US 50/US 301 east from I-97 to just west of the Severn River. I-297 would follow MD 3 between a pair of intersections with I-97 in Millersville and Bowie. AASHTO rescinded its approval of the 1975 plan at its June 1981 meeting, then approved what was essentially the original 1975 plan at its June 1982 meeting. The east–west segment of I-97 and I-197 was replaced by I-68. I-297 was withdrawn by request of the state of Maryland in 1983. The 1982 concept of I-68 became unsigned I-595 and I-68 was applied to the National Freeway in Western Maryland in 1991 after AASHTO approved the new designations at its June 1989 meeting.

The first portion of I-97 proper to be constructed was the section south of Millersville, which was placed under construction in three sections in March 1985. The first section of the highway, from US 50/US 301 to Millersville Road west of the MD 178 interchange, opened in December 1987. Construction of I-97 from Millersville Road to the intersection of MD 3 and MD 178 at Dorrs Corner started in July 1987. The Interstate through Millersville opened in April 1989. The interchange at I-97&#x27;s southern terminus was originally constructed as a partial interchange, with I-97 tying into what are now the collector–distributor lanes of US 50 and US 301. The ramps from eastbound US 50/US 301 to I-97 and from I-97 to the westbound US Routes were added during the reconstruction of US 50/US 301 in 1992 and 1993.

===Reconstruction of existing highway===
Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex operation that involved many temporary openings, lane shifts, construction of new roadways, and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years. The first improvement was the reconstruction of the I-695 interchange between 1987 and 1991. The modern ramps from I-97 to westbound I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built, eastbound I-695&#x27;s ramp over these two ramps was constructed, and the loop ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695 was removed. I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new beltway ramps was reconstructed to Interstate Highway standards and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995. Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to westbound I-695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648.
Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway from Millersville to MD 3 Bus. began in 1987 over two sections. The first section, from north of MD 3 Bus. to north of Benfield Boulevard, began in 1987. The work included the construction of the flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to Veterans Highway just south of MD 3 Bus. The section from north of Benfield Boulevard to MD 178 at Dorrs Corner was reconstructed starting in 1989. The second section included construction of the Benfield Boulevard interchange. The southbound MD 3 roadway was rebuilt in place as the southbound lanes of I-97. New northbound lanes were built immediately to the east of the southbound lanes. In February 1991, the new northbound lanes opened and access from I-97 to Veterans Highway was removed at Dorrs Corner. The old northbound lanes were reconstructed and repurposed as a two-lane road, Veterans Highway, later that year. Anne Arundel County agreed to accept Veterans Highway for maintenance after the I-97–related construction concluded in a road transfer agreement on July 21, 1988. MD 3 was truncated at Millersville after I-97 opened in October 1991; signage for MD 3 on I-695 was removed by 1993.

Before reconstruction of the Glen Burnie Bypass from MD 3 Bus. to MD 648 began in November 1993, the Stewart Avenue bridge across the Interstate just south of the MD 100 interchange was replaced and ramps from northbound I-97 to eastbound MD 100 and from westbound MD 100 to southbound I-97 were added between 1990 and 1992. The freeway was reconstructed to Interstate standards in three sections. The middle section from MD 174 to MD 176 was reconstructed concurrently with the segment of MD 100 west from I-97 to MD 295 starting in 1993. That segment of MD 100, including the MD 100–I-97 interchange, opened in November 1996, and the reconstruction of the middle section of I-97 was finished in July 1997. The sections of I-97 from MD 3 Bus. to MD 174 and from MD 176 to MD 648 and were reconstructed starting in January 1994. The MD 176–MD 648 roadway sectional was completed in March 1996. The northern half of the MD 176 interchange was reconstructed as part of the latter project. The new loop ramp from northbound I-97 to westbound MD 176 and the new ramp from MD 176 to northbound I-97 were completed in 1995. The ramp from southbound I-97 to MD 176 was removed during the widening project. The pair of ramps between southbound I-97 and MD 162 to replace the removed ramp were constructed between 1996 and 1998. The final piece of construction on I-97 was the reconstruction of its interchange with MD 174, which began in 2002 and concluded in 2005.

== Future ==
MDOT plans to widen I-97 to a six-lane freeway between the US 50 and MD 32 interchanges, add an auxiliary lane on northbound and southbound I-97 between the MD 32 and MD 178 interchanges in Millersville, and widen northbound I-97 to four lanes from US 50 to some point north of MD 450. The collector-distributor on westbound US 50 between the I-97 and MD 665 interchanges is to be widened to four lanes. Such widening will include the reconstruction and widening of the bridges over MD 450 and Crownsville Road. The project is expected to start construction around 2027.

<text>The TX-0, for Transistorized Experimental computerzero, but affectionately referred to as tixo (pronounced &quot;tix oh&quot;), was an early fully transistorized computer and contained a then-huge 64K of 18-bit words of magnetic-core memory. Construction of the TX-0 began in 1955 and ended in 1956. It was used continually through the 1960s at MIT. The TX-0 incorporated around 3,600 Philco high-frequency surface-barrier transistors, the first transistor suitable for high-speed computers. The TX-0 and its direct descendant, the original PDP-1, were platforms for pioneering computer research and the development of what would later be called computer &quot;hacker&quot; culture. For MIT, this was the first computer to provide a system console which allowed for direct interaction, as opposed to previous computers, which required the use of punched card as a primary interface for programmers debugging their programs. 
Members of MIT&#x27;s Tech Model Railroad Club, &quot;the very first hackers at MIT&quot;, reveled in the interactivity afforded 
by the console, and were recruited by Marvin Minsky to work on this and other systems used by Minsky&#x27;s AI group.

==Background==
Designed at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory largely as an experiment in transistorized design and the construction of very SMALL core memory systems, the TX-0 was essentially a transistorized version of the equally famous Whirlwind, also built at Lincoln Lab. While the Whirlwind filled an entire floor (occupying over ), TX-0 fit in a single reasonably sized room and yet was somewhat faster. Like the Whirlwind, the TX-0 was equipped with a vector display system, consisting of a 12-inch oscilloscope with a working area of 7 by 7 inches connected to the 18-bit output register of the computer, allowing it to display points and vectors with a resolution up to 512×512 screen locations.

The TX-0 was an 18-bit computer with a 16-bit address range. The first two bits of the machine word designated the instruction, and the remaining 16 bits are used to specify the memory location or operand for the special &quot;operate&quot; instruction. These two bits created four possible instructions, which included store, add, and conditional branch instructions as a basic set. 

Wesley A. Clark designed the logic and Ken Olsen oversaw the engineering development.

==Development==
Initially a vacuum-tube computer named TX-1 was being designed to test the first large magnetic-core memory bank. However, the design was never approved and the TX-1 was never built. Instead, the TX-0 was designed for the same purpose, except using transistors. With the successful completion of the TX-0, work turned immediately to the much larger and far more complex TX-2, completed in 1958. Since core memory was very expensive at the time, several parts of the TX-0 memory were cannibalized for the TX-2 project.

After a time, the TX-0 was no longer considered worth keeping at Lincoln Lab, and was &quot;loaned&quot; (semi-permanently) to the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) in July 1958, where it became a centerpiece of research that would eventually evolve into the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and the original computer hacker culture. Delivered from Lincoln Laboratory with only 4K of core, the machine no longer needed 16 bits to represent a storage address. After about a year and a half, the number of instruction bits was doubled to four, allowing a total of 16 instructions, and an index register was added. This dramatically improved programmability of the machine, but still left room for a later memory expansion to 8K (the four instruction bits and one-bit indexing flag left 13 bits for addressing). This newly modified TX-0 was used to develop a huge number of advances in computing, including speech and handwriting recognition, as well as the tools needed to work on such projects, including text editors and debuggers.

Meanwhile the TX-2 project was running into difficulties of its own, and several team members decided to leave the project at Lincoln Lab and start their own company - Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).

==Legacy==
After a short time selling &quot;lab modules&quot; in the form of simple logic elements from the TX-2 design, the newly formed Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) decided to produce a &quot;cleaned up&quot; TX-0 design, and delivered it in 1961 as the PDP-1. A year later, DEC donated the engineering prototype PDP-1 machine to MIT. It was installed in the room next to TX-0, and the two machines would run side-by-side for almost a decade.

Significant pieces of the TX-0 are held by MIT Lincoln Laboratory. In 1983, the TX-0 was still running and is shown running a maze application in the first episode of &quot;Computer Chronicles&quot;.

As part of its use in artificial intelligence research, the computer was used to write simple western playlets and was featured in the 1961 CBS television documentary &quot;The Thinking Machine&quot;, and in the companion book by John Pfeiffer of the same title published by the JB Lippincott Company in 1962.

<text>A graphics tablet (also known as a digitizer, digital graphic tablet, pen tablet, drawing tablet, external drawing pad or digital art board) is a computer input device that enables a user to hand draw or paint images, animations and graphics, with a special pen-like stylus, similar to the way a person draws pictures with a pencil and paper by hand.

Graphics tablets may also be used to capture data or handwritten signatures. They can also be used to trace an image from a piece of paper that is taped or otherwise secured to the tablet surface. Capturing data in this way, by tracing or entering the corners of linear polylines or shapes, is called digitizing.

The device consists of a rough surface upon which the user may &quot;draw&quot; or trace an image using the attached stylus, a pen-like drawing apparatus. The image is shown on the computer monitor, though some graphic tablets now also incorporate an LCD screen for more realistic or natural experience and usability.

Some tablets are intended as a replacement for the computer mouse as the primary pointing and navigation device for desktop computers.

== History ==
The first electronic handwriting device was the Telautograph, patented by Elisha Gray in 1888. 

The first graphic tablet resembling contemporary tablets and used for handwriting recognition by a computer was the &quot;Stylator&quot; in 1957. Better known (and often misstated as the first digitizer tablet) is the RAND Tablet also known as the &quot;Grafacon&quot; (for Graphic Converter), introduced in 1964. The RAND Tablet employed a grid of wires under the surface of the pad that encoded horizontal and vertical coordinates in a small electrostatic signal. The stylus received the signal by capacitive coupling, which could then be decoded back as coordinate information.

The acoustic tablet, or &quot;spark tablet&quot;, used a stylus that generated clicks with a spark plug. The clicks were then triangulated by a series of microphones to locate the pen in space. The system was fairly complex and expensive, and the sensors were susceptible to interference by external noise.

Digitizers were popularized in the mid-1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. The Summagraphics digitizers were sold under the company&#x27;s name but were also private labeled for HP, Tektronix, Apple, Evans and Sutherland and several other graphic system manufacturers. The ID model was the first graphics tablet to make use of what was at the time, the new Intel microprocessor technology. This embedded processing power allowed the ID models to have twice the accuracy of previous models while still making use of the same foundation technology. Key to this accuracy improvement were two US Patents issued to Stephen Domyan, Robert Davis, and Edward Snyder. The Bit Pad model was the first attempt at a low cost graphics tablet with an initial selling price of $555 when other graphics tablets were selling in the $2,000 to $3,000 price range. This lower cost opened up the opportunities for would be entrepreneurs to be able to write graphics software for a multitude of new applications. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems as well as bundled with PCs and PC-based CAD software like AutoCAD. These tablets used a magnetostriction technology which used wires made of a special alloy stretched over a solid substrate to accurately locate the tip of a stylus or the center of a digitizer cursor on the surface of the tablet. This technology also allowed Proximity or &quot;Z&quot; axis measurement.

In 1981, musician Todd Rundgren created the first color graphic tablet software for personal computers, which was licensed to Apple as the Utopia Graphic Tablet System.

In 1981, the Quantel Paintbox color graphic workstation was released; This model was equipped with the first pressure sensitive tablet.

The first home computer graphic tablet was the KoalaPad, released in 1983. Though originally designed for the Apple II, the Koala eventually broadened its applicability to other home computers including the TRS-80 Color Computer, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit computers.

In the 1980s, several vendors of graphic tablets began to include additional functions, such as handwriting recognition and on-tablet menus.

== Characteristics ==
Typically tablets are characterized by size of the device, drawing area, its resolution size (&quot;active area&quot;, which is measured in lpi), pressure sensitivity (level of varying the size of strokes with pressure), number of buttons and types and number of interfaces: Bluetooth, USB; etc. The actual drawing accuracy is restricted to pen&#x27;s nib size.

== Types ==

There have been many attempts to categorize the technologies that have been used for graphic tablets:

; Passive tablets:Passive tablets make use of electromagnetic induction technology, where the horizontal and vertical wires of the tablet operate as both transmitting and receiving coils (as opposed to the wires of the RAND Tablet which only transmit). The tablet generates an electromagnetic signal, which is received by the LC circuit in the stylus. The wires in the tablet then change to a receiving mode and read the signal generated by the stylus. Modern arrangements also provide pressure sensitivity and one or more buttons, with the electronics for this information present in the stylus. On older tablets, changing the pressure on the stylus nib or pressing a button changed the properties of the LC circuit, affecting the signal generated by the pen, which modern ones often encode into the signal as a digital data stream. By using electromagnetic signals, the tablet is able to sense the stylus position without the stylus having to even touch the surface, and powering the pen with this signal means that devices used with the tablet never need batteries. Activslate 50, the model used with Promethean white boards, also uses a hybrid of this technology.
; Active tablets: Active tablets differ in that the stylus used contains self-powered electronics that generate and transmit a signal to the tablet. These styluses rely on an internal battery rather than the tablet for their power, resulting in a bulkier stylus. Eliminating the need to power the pen means that such tablets may listen for pen signals constantly, as they do not have to alternate between transmit and receive modes, which can result in less jitter.
; Optical tablets: Optical tablets operate by a very small digital camera in the stylus and then doing pattern matching on the image of the paper. The most successful example is the technology developed by Anoto.
; Acoustic tablets:Early models were described as spark tablets—a small sound generator was mounted in the stylus, and the acoustic signal picked up by two microphones placed near the writing surface. Some modern designs are able to read positions in three dimensions.
; Capacitive tablets:These tablets have also been designed to use an electrostatic or capacitive signal. Scriptel&#x27;s designs are one example of a high-performance tablet detecting an electrostatic signal. Unlike the type of capacitive design used for touchscreens, the Scriptel design is able to detect the position of the pen while it is in proximity to or hovering above the tablet. Many multi-touch tablets use capacitive sensing.

For all these technologies, the tablet can use the received signal to also determine the distance of the stylus from the surface of the tablet, the tilt (angle from vertical) of the stylus, and other information in addition to the horizontal and vertical positions, such as clicking buttons of the stylus or the rotation of the stylus.

Compared to touchscreens, a graphic tablet generally offers much higher precision, the ability to track an object which is not touching the tablet, and can gather much more information about the stylus, but is typically more expensive, and can only be used with the special stylus or other accessories.

Some tablets, especially inexpensive ones aimed at young children, come with a corded stylus, using technology similar to older RAND tablets.

== Pucks ==

After styluses, pucks are the most commonly used tablet accessory. A puck is a mouse-like device that can detect its absolute position and rotation. This is opposed to a mouse, which can only sense its relative velocity on a surface (most tablet drivers are capable of allowing a puck to emulate a mouse in operation, and many pucks are marketed as a &quot;mouse&quot;).

Pucks range in size and shape; some are externally indistinguishable from a mouse, while others are a fairly large device with dozens of buttons and controls. Professional pucks often have a reticle or loupe which allows the user to see the exact point on the tablet&#x27;s surface targeted by the puck, for detailed tracing and computer aided design (CAD) work.

Pucks are used on the Microsoft Surface range and were recently used on the Dell Canvas. However, they have been largely discontinued by most manufactures in favour of physical hotkeys and dials.

== Embedded LCD tablets ==

Some graphics tablets incorporate an LCD into the tablet itself, allowing the user to draw or paint directly on the screen.

Graphics tablet/screen hybrids offer advantages over both standard PC touchscreens and ordinary graphics tablets. Unlike touchscreens, they offer pressure sensitivity, and their input resolution is generally higher. While their pressure sensitivity and resolution are typically no better than those of ordinary tablets, they offer the additional advantage of directly seeing the location of the physical pen device relatively to the image on the screen. This often allows for increased accuracy and a more tactile, &quot;real&quot; feeling to the use of the device.

The graphics tablet manufacturer Wacom holds many patents on key technologies for graphics tablets, which forces competitors to use other technologies or license Wacom&#x27;s patents. The displays are often sold for thousands of dollars. For instance, the Wacom Cintiq series ranges from just below to over .
Some commercially available graphics tablet/screen hybrids include:

* Monoprice 19-Inch Interactive Display
* Cintiq from Wacom
* Kamvas (e.g. Kamvas Studio 22) from Huion
* XP-PEN
* GAOMON
* Parblo
* Ugee
* Xencelabs 
* VEIKK

There have also been do-it-yourself projects where conventional used LCD monitors and graphics tablets have been converted to a graphics tablet-screen hybrid.

== Uses ==

Graphic tablets, because of their stylus-based interface and ability to detect some or all of pressure, tilt, and other attributes of the stylus and its interaction with the tablet, are widely considered to offer a very natural way to create computer graphics, especially two-dimensional computer graphics. Indeed, many graphic packages can make use of the pressure (and, sometimes, stylus tilt or rotation) information generated by a tablet, by modifying the brush size, shape, opacity, color, or other attributes based on data received from the graphic tablet.

In East Asia, graphic tablets, known as &quot;pen tablets&quot;, are widely used in conjunction with input-method editor software (IMEs) to write Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters (CJK). The technology is popular and inexpensive and offers a method for interacting with the computer in a more natural way than typing on the keyboard, with the pen tablet supplanting the role of the computer mouse. Uptake of handwriting recognition among users who use alphabetic scripts has been slower.

Graphic tablets are commonly used in the artistic world. Using a pen-like stylus on a graphic tablet combined with a graphics-editing program, such as Illustrator, Photoshop by Adobe Systems, Corelpainter, or Krita gives artists a lot of precision when creating digital drawings or artwork. Photographers can also find working with a graphic tablet during their post processing can really speed up tasks like creating a detailed layer mask or dodging and burning.

Educators make use of tablets in classrooms to project handwritten notes or lessons and to allow students to do the same, as well as providing feedback on student work submitted electronically. Online teachers may also use a tablet for marking student work, or for live tutorials or lessons, especially where complex visual information or mathematical equations are required. Students are also increasingly using them as note-taking devices, especially during university lectures while following along with the lecturer. They facilitate smooth online teaching process and are popularly used along with face-cam to mimic classroom experience.

Tablets are also popular for technical drawings and CAD, as one can typically put a piece of paper on them without interfering with their function.

Finally, tablets are gaining popularity as a replacement for the computer mouse as a pointing device. They can feel more intuitive to some users than a mouse, as the position of a pen on a tablet typically corresponds to the location of the pointer on the GUI shown on the computer screen. Those artists using a pen for graphic work may, as a matter of convenience, use a tablet and pen for standard computer operations rather than put down the pen and find a mouse. Popular rhythm game osu! allows utilizing a tablet as a way of playing. 

Graphic tablets are available in various sizes and price ranges; A6-sized tablets being relatively inexpensive and A3-sized tablets far more expensive. Modern tablets usually connect to the computer via a USB or HDMI interface.

== Similar devices ==
Interactive whiteboards offer high-resolution wall size graphic tablets up to 95&quot; (241,3 cm) along with options for pressure and multiple input. These are becoming commonplace in schools and meeting rooms around the world.

Earlier resistive touch screen devices (like PDAs, early smartphones, tablet PCs, and the Nintendo DS) were typically equipped with styluses, but accuracy of stylus input was very limited. 

The more modern capacitive touch screens such as those found on some table computers, tablet computers and laptops operate in similar ways, but they usually use either optical grids or a pressure-sensitive film instead so do not need a special pointing device. Some of the latest models with capacitive input can be equipped with specialized styluses, and then these input devices can be used similar to full-function graphics tablet.

A graphic tablet is also used for Audio-Haptic products where blind or visually impaired people touch swelled graphics on a graphic tablet and get audio feedback from that. The product that is using this technology is called Tactile Talking Tablet or T3.

<text>Colonel Chris Austin Hadfield (born August 29, 1959) is a Canadian retired astronaut, engineer, fighter pilot, musician, and writer. As the first Canadian to perform extravehicular activity in outer space, he has flown two Space Shuttle missions and also served as commander of the International Space Station (ISS). Prior to his career as an astronaut, he served in the Canadian Armed Forces for 25 years as an Air Command fighter pilot.

Hadfield has cited part of his career inspiration to have come to him as a child, when he watched the first crewed Moon landing by American spaceflight Apollo 11 on television. He attended high school in Oakville and Milton in southern Ontario, and earned his glider pilot licence as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. After enlisting in the Canadian Armed Forces, he earned an engineering degree at the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario. Hadfield learned to fly various types of aircraft in the military and eventually became a test pilot, flying several experimental planes. As part of an exchange program with the United States Navy and United States Air Force, he obtained a master&#x27;s degree in aviation systems at the University of Tennessee Space Institute.

In 1992, Hadfield was accepted into the Canadian astronaut program by the Canadian Space Agency. He first flew in space in November 1995 as a mission specialist aboard , visiting the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot;. He flew again in April 2001 on , when he visited the ISS and walked in space to help install Canadarm2. In December 2012, he flew for a third time aboard Soyuz TMA-07M to join Expedition 34 on the ISS. When Expedition 34 ended in March 2013, Hadfield became the commander of the ISS as part of Expedition 35, responsible for a crew of five astronauts and helping to run dozens of scientific experiments dealing with the impact of low gravity on human biology. During this mission, he chronicled life onboard the space station by taking pictures of Earth and posting them on various social media platforms. He was a guest on television news and talk shows and gained popularity by playing the ISS&#x27;s guitar in space. Hadfield returned to Earth in May 2013, when the mission ended. He announced his retirement shortly after returning, capping a 35-year-long career as a military pilot and astronaut. He has five published books including his autobiography, the NYT-bestseller &quot;An Astronaut&#x27;s Guide to Life on Earth&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Hadfield was born in Sarnia, Ontario. His parents are Roger and Eleanor Hadfield, who live in Milton, Ontario. Hadfield was raised on a corn farm in southern Ontario. He was a member of a Wolf Cub Pack that met at the Milton Fairgrounds. He became interested in flying at a young age and in being an astronaut at age nine, when he saw the Apollo 11 Moon landing on television. On December 23, 1981, in Waterloo, Ontario, Hadfield married his high-school girlfriend Helene Hadfield (née Walter), with whom he has three children: Kyle, Evan, and Kristin Hadfield. Hadfield used to be a ski instructor at Glen Eden Ski Area before becoming a test pilot.

Hadfield is of northern English and southern Scottish descent. He is a devoted fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and wore a Leafs jersey under his spacesuit during his Soyuz TMA-07M re-entry in May 2013. After the 2012–13 NHL lockout ended, Hadfield tweeted a photo of himself holding a Maple Leafs logo, and stated he was &quot;ready to cheer [his team] on from orbit&quot;. He sang the Canadian National Anthem during the Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens game on January 18, 2014, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. In November 2022, he was invited by coach John Herdman to speak to the Canada soccer team ahead of their first match in the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

== Education and military career ==
Hadfield attended White Oaks Secondary School in Oakville, Ontario until his senior year and then graduated as an Ontario Scholar from Milton District High School in 1977. As a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets, he earned a glider pilot scholarship at age 15 and a powered pilot scholarship at age 16. After graduating from high school in 1978, he joined the Canadian Armed Forces and spent two years at Royal Roads Military College followed by two years at the Royal Military College of Canada, where he received a B.Eng. degree (with honours) in mechanical engineering in 1982. He also conducted his post-graduate research at the University of Waterloo in 1982. Before graduating, he also underwent basic flight training at CFB Portage la Prairie. In 1983, he took honours as the top graduate from Basic Jet Training at CFB Moose Jaw, and then went on to train as a tactical fighter pilot with 410 Tactical Fighter Operational Training Squadron at CFB Cold Lake, flying the Canadair CF-116 Freedom Fighter and the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet. After completing his fighter training, Hadfield flew CF-18 Hornets with 425 Tactical Fighter Squadron, flying intercept missions for NORAD. He was the first CF-18 pilot to intercept a Soviet Tupolev Tu 95 long-range bomber in the Canadian Arctic.

In the late 1980s, Hadfield attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base and served as an exchange officer with the U.S. Navy at Strike Test Directorate at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station. His accomplishments from 1989 to 1992 included testing the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet and LTV A-7 Corsair II aircraft; performing research work with NASA on pitch control margin simulation and flight; completing the first military flight of F/A-18 enhanced performance engines; piloting the first flight test of the National Aerospace Plane external burning hydrogen propulsion engine; developing a new handling qualities rating scale for high angle-of-attack test; and participating in the F/A-18 out-of-control recovery test program.

In May 1992, Hadfield graduated with an M.Sc. degree in aviation systems from the University of Tennessee Space Institute, where his thesis concerned high-angle attack aerodynamics of the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet. In total, Hadfield has flown over 70 different types of aircraft.

== Astronaut career ==

Hadfield was selected to become one of four new Canadian astronauts from a field of 5,330 applicants in June 1992. Three of those four (Dafydd Williams, Julie Payette and Hadfield) have flown in space. The fourth candidate, Michael McKay, resigned as an astronaut in 1995. Hadfield was assigned by the CSA to the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas in August, where he addressed technical and safety issues for Shuttle Operations Development, contributed to the development of the glass shuttle cockpit, and supported shuttle launches at the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida. In addition, Hadfield was NASA&#x27;s chief CAPCOM (capsule communicator&quot;)&quot;, the voice of mission control to astronauts in orbit, for 25 Space Shuttle missions. From 1996 to 2000, he represented CSA astronauts and coordinated their activities as the chief astronaut for the CSA.

He was the director of operations for NASA at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) in Star City, Russia from 2001 until 2003. Some of his duties included co-ordination and direction of all International Space Station crew activities in Russia, oversight of training and crew support staff, as well as policy negotiation with the Russian Space Program and other International Partners. He also trained and became fully qualified to be a flight engineer cosmonaut in the Soyuz TMA spacecraft, and to perform spacewalks in the Russian Orlan spacesuit.

Hadfield is a civilian CSA astronaut, having retired as a colonel from the Canadian Armed Forces in 2003 after 25 years of military service. He was chief of robotics for the NASA Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas from 2003 to 2006 and was chief of International Space Station Operations from 2006 to 2008. In 2008 and 2009, he trained as a back-up to Robert Thirsk on Expedition 21. In May 2010, Hadfield served as the commander of the NEEMO 14 mission aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory, living and working underwater for fourteen days. NASA announced in 2010 that Hadfield would become the first Canadian commander of the International Space Station, leading Expedition 35 after its launch on December 19, 2012. His craft docked with the station on December 21. He remained on the station for five months, transferring control to Pavel Vinogradov and departing on May 13, 2013.

In June 2013, one month after completing his third trip to space, Hadfield announced his retirement from the Canadian Space Agency, effective July 3, 2013. Hadfield stated that after living primarily in the United States since the 1980s for his career, he would be moving back to Canada, &quot;making good on a promise I made my wife nearly 30 years ago—that yes, eventually, we would be moving back to Canada.&quot; He noted that he plans to pursue private interests outside government there.

Hadfield is enthusiastic about the prospects for a crewed mission to Mars, and when asked in 2011 if he would consider being the first to visit even if the journey to Mars were one-way, he said &quot;I would be honoured to be given the opportunity.&quot;

=== STS-74 ===

Hadfield served as mission specialist 1 on STS-74 in November 1995. It was NASA&#x27;s second space shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station &quot;Mir&quot;. During the flight, the crew of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; attached a five-tonne docking module to &quot;Mir&quot; and transferred over 1,000 kg of food, water, and scientific supplies to the cosmonauts. Hadfield flew as the first Canadian to operate the Canadarm in orbit, and the only Canadian ever to board &quot;Mir&quot;.

=== STS-100 ===
In April 2001, Hadfield served as mission specialist 1 on STS-100, International Space Station (ISS) assembly Flight 6A. The crew of Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; delivered and installed Canadarm2, the new Canadian-built robotic arm, as well as the Italian-made resupply module &quot;Raffaello&quot;. During the 11-day flight, Hadfield performed two spacewalks, which made him the first Canadian to ever leave a spacecraft and float freely in space. During his first spacewalk Hadfield experienced severe eye irritation due to the anti-fog solution used to polish his spacesuit visor, temporarily blinding him and forcing him to vent oxygen into space. In total, Hadfield spent 14 hours, 50 minutes outside, travelling 10 times around the world during his spacewalk.

=== International Space Station ===
On December 19, 2012, Hadfield launched in the Soyuz TMA-07M flight for a long duration stay on board the ISS as part of Expedition 35. He arrived at the station two days later, as scheduled, and became the first Canadian to command the ISS when the crew of Expedition 34 departed in March 2013. On May 12, 2013, he turned over command of the ISS, and returned home aboard the Soyuz spacecraft on May 13. He received significant media exposure during his time on the ISS, and ended his time on the station by paying tribute to David Bowie with a rendition of &quot;Space Oddity&quot;.

== Social media ==
Hadfield has a social media presence, with over 2,400,000 Twitter followers . He created one of the top Reddit ask me anything (AMA) threads of all time on February 17, 2013. He also maintains accounts on Facebook, Tumblr, and YouTube. His exchanges with William Shatner and other &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors have received media coverage. Hadfield has been described by Forbes as &quot;perhaps the most social media savvy astronaut ever to leave Earth&quot;.

Hadfield enlisted the help of his son Evan to manage his social media presence. They work in tandem to share information over the internet about aspects of life as an astronaut, both the scientific and the mundane.

== Music ==
During his free time on Expedition 35, Hadfield recorded music for an album, using the Larrivée Parlor guitar previously brought to the ISS. The first song recorded in space, &quot;Jewel in the Night&quot;, was released via YouTube on Christmas Eve 2012.

His collaboration with Ed Robertson of Barenaked Ladies and the Wexford Gleeks, &quot;Is Somebody Singing?&quot;—sometimes shortened &quot;I.S.S.&quot;—was aired on the CBC Radio program Q and released by CBC Music online on February 8, 2013. Hadfield sang &quot;Is Somebody Singing&quot; along with singers across Canada for the national Music Monday program. Hadfield has been credited musically on his brother Dave Hadfield&#x27;s albums. He also the &quot;Canada Song&quot; with his brother, released on YouTube on Canada Day, 2014.

On May 12, 2013, after handing over command of the ISS, but before returning home, Hadfield released a music video recorded on the ISS of a modified rendition of &quot;Space Oddity&quot; by David Bowie. , the video has over 55 million views on YouTube. The performance was the subject of a piece by Glenn Fleishman in &quot;The Economist&quot; on May 22, 2013, analysing the legal implications of publicly performing a copyrighted work of music while in Earth orbit.

In October 2015, Hadfield released &quot;Space Sessions: Songs From a Tin Can&quot;, an album of songs that he had recorded on the International Space Station.

== Post-retirement ==
In October 2013 Hadfield was interviewed by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine and appeared on its cover wearing face make-up to &quot;replicate Bowie&#x27;s famed image from the cover of his &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; album.&quot; Hadfield wrote an article for the December 2013 edition of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine in which he reflects on his time spent on the International Space Station.
On October 8, 2013, the University of Waterloo announced that Hadfield will join the university as a professor for a three-year term beginning in the Fall of 2014. Hadfield&#x27;s work is expected to involve instructing and advising roles in aviation programs offered by the Faculty of Environment and Faculty of Science, as well as assisting in ongoing research regarding the health of astronauts with the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences.

In 2017, Hadfield hosted the BBC show &quot;Astronauts: Do You Have What It Takes?&quot; alongside Kevin Fong and Iya Whiteley, where 12 contestants compete to earn Hadfield&#x27;s approval and recommendation as a candidate for future applications to become an astronaut. The challenges involved replicated real tests carried out by the different Space Agencies at facilities in Europe and America, including hypoxia and centrifuge training, with contestants eliminated each week.

Hadfield hosted a web series about space exploration on the video platform MasterClass.

On February 9, 2021, Virgin Galactic announced that Hadfield would be joining their Space Advisory Board to help &quot;provide advice to senior management as the company moves forward to open space for the benefit of all.&quot; Hadfield will be joined by former astronaut Sandra Magnus and Chief Scientist of Cubic Corporation David A. Whelan.

=== Writing ===
Hadfield&#x27;s 2013 autobiography, &quot;An Astronaut&#x27;s Guide to Life on Earth: What Going to Space Taught Me About Ingenuity, Determination, and Being Prepared for Anything&quot; deals with his professional life and work, and with numerous examples from the lead-up to his command of Expedition 35. The book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and was also the bestselling book in Canada on a Canadian subject.

In 2021, Hadfield released his debut novel &quot;The Apollo Murders&quot;, a thriller set in the Cold War. A sequel entitled &quot;The Defector&quot;, was released in 2023.

In 2013, Hadfield was presented with an Honorary Diploma from Nova Scotia Community College.

Hadfield was commemorated on Royal Canadian Mint silver and gold coins for his spacewalk to install Canadarm2 on the International Space Station in 2001. In Sarnia, the city airport was renamed to Sarnia Chris Hadfield Airport in 1997 and there are two public schools named after him – one in Milton, Ontario and the other in Bradford, Ontario. The asteroid 14143 Hadfield is also named after him. In 2005, the Royal Canadian Air Cadets 820 Milton Blue Thunder Squadron was renamed as the 820 Chris Hadfield Squadron in honour of Hadfield, who was a cadet there from 1971 to 1978. The Town of Milton also named a municipal park and street after Hadfield. His name was in 2014 added to the Wall of Honour at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, and, in 2020, the newly discovered &quot;Andrena hadfieldi&quot;, a species of bee, was named in his honour.

His affiliations include membership in the Royal Military College Club, Society of Experimental Test Pilots, Canadian Aeronautics and Space Institute, and serving as honorary patron of Lambton College, former trustee of Lakefield College School, board member of the International Space School Foundation, and executive with the Association of Space Explorers.

Upon his taking command of the International Space Station, Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, sent Hadfield a personal message of congratulations, stating &quot;I am pleased to transmit my personal best wishes, and those of all Canadians, to Colonel Christopher Hadfield as he takes command of the International Space Station&quot;. Elizabeth&#x27;s successor, Charles III, held an audience with Hadfield at Buckingham Palace on February 9, 2023, to discuss sustainability in space.

<text>Ivan Edward Sutherland (born May 16, 1938) is an American computer scientist and Internet pioneer, widely regarded as a pioneer of computer graphics. His early work in computer graphics as well as his teaching with David C. Evans in that subject at the University of Utah in the 1970s was pioneering in the field. Sutherland, Evans, and their students from that era developed several foundations of modern computer graphics. He received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1988 for the invention of the Sketchpad, an early predecessor to the sort of graphical user interface that has become ubiquitous in personal computers. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, as well as the National Academy of Sciences among many other major awards. In 2012, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology for &quot;pioneering achievements in the development of computer graphics and interactive interfaces&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Sutherland&#x27;s father was from New Zealand; his mother, Anne Sutherland, was from Scotland. His family moved to Wilmette, Illinois, then Scarsdale, New York, for his father&#x27;s career. Bert Sutherland was his elder brother. Ivan Sutherland earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, his master&#x27;s degree from Caltech, and his Ph.D. from MIT in electrical engineering in 1963.

Sutherland invented Sketchpad in 1962 while at MIT. Claude Shannon signed on to supervise Sutherland&#x27;s computer drawing thesis. Among others on his thesis committee were Marvin Minsky and Steven Coons. Sketchpad was an innovative program that influenced alternative forms of interaction with computers. Sketchpad could accept constraints and specified relationships among segments and arcs, including the diameter of arcs. It could draw both horizontal and vertical lines and combine them into figures and shapes. Figures could be copied, moved, rotated, or resized, retaining their basic properties. Sketchpad also had the first window-drawing program and clipping algorithm, which allowed zooming. Sketchpad ran on the Lincoln TX-2 computer.

==Career and research==
From 1963 to 1965, after he received his PhD, he served in the U.S. Army, commissioning as an officer through the ROTC program at Carnegie Institute of Technology. As a first lieutenant, Sutherland replaced J. C. R. Licklider as the head of the US Defense Department Advanced Research Project Agency&#x27;s Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), when Licklider took a job at IBM in 1964.

From 1965 to 1968, Sutherland was an associate professor of electrical engineering at Harvard University. Work with student Danny Cohen in 1967 led to the development of the Cohen–Sutherland computer graphics line clipping algorithm. In 1968, with his students Bob Sproull, Quintin Foster, Danny Cohen, and others he created the first head-mounted display that rendered images for the viewer&#x27;s changing pose, as sensed by The Sword of Damocles, thus making the first virtual reality system. A prior system, Sensorama, used a head-mounted display to play back static video and other sensory stimuli. The optical see-through head-mounted display used in Sutherland&#x27;s VR system was a stock item used by U.S. military helicopter pilots to view video from cameras mounted on the helicopter&#x27;s belly.

From 1968 to 1974, Sutherland was a professor at the University of Utah. Among his students there were Alan Kay, inventor of the Smalltalk language, Gordon W. Romney (computer and cybersecurity scientist), who rendered the first 3D images at U of U, Henri Gouraud, who devised the Gouraud shading technique, Frank Crow, who went on to develop antialiasing methods, Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics, Henry Fuchs, and Edwin Catmull, co-founder of Pixar and now president of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios.

In 1968 he co-founded Evans &amp; Sutherland with his friend and colleague David C. Evans. The company did pioneering work in the field of real-time hardware, accelerated 3D computer graphics, and printer languages. Former employees of Evans &amp; Sutherland included the future founders of Adobe (John Warnock) and Silicon Graphics (Jim Clark).

From 1974 to 1978 he was the Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science at California Institute of Technology, where he was the founding head of that school&#x27;s computer science department. He then founded a consulting firm, Sutherland, Sproull and Associates, which was purchased in 1990 by Sun Microsystems to form the seed of its research division, Sun Labs.

Sutherland was a fellow and vice president at Sun Microsystems. Sutherland was a visiting scholar in the computer science division at University of California, Berkeley (fall 2005 – spring 2008). Since 2009, Sutherland and Roncken have led the research in Asynchronous Systems at Portland State University.

===Quotes===
* &quot;A display connected to a digital computer gives us a chance to gain familiarity with concepts not realizable in the physical world. It is a looking glass into a mathematical wonderland.&quot;
* &quot;The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal.&quot;
* When asked: &quot;How could you possibly have done the first interactive graphics program, the first non-procedural programming language, the first object oriented software system, all in one year?&quot;, Sutherland replied: &quot;Well, I didn&#x27;t know it was hard.&quot;

<doc id="78124" wikidata="Q5468319" url="?curid=78124" title="Foreign Sales Corporation">
<text>Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) was a type of tax device allowed under the United States Internal Revenue Code that allowed companies to receive a reduction in U.S. federal income tax for profits derived from exports.

The FSC was created in 1984 to replace the old export-promoting tax scheme, the Domestic International Sales Corporation, or DISC. An international dispute arose in 1971, when the United States introduced legislation providing for DISCs. These laws were challenged by the European Community under the GATT. The United States then counterclaimed that European tax regulations concerning extraterritorial income were also GATT-incompatible. In 1976, a GATT panel found that both DISCs and the European tax regulations were GATT-incompatible. These cases were settled, however, by the Tokyo Round Code on Subsidies and Countervailing Duties, predecessor to today&#x27;s Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM), and the GATT Council decided in 1981 to adopt the panel reports subject to the understanding that the terms of the settlement would apply. The WTO Panel in the 1999 case later ruled that the 1981 decision did not constitute a legal instrument within the meaning of GATT-1994, and hence was not binding on the panel.

The European Union (EU) launched legal proceedings against the U.S. law in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999, claiming the U.S. law allowed an export subsidy. In March 2000, the Appellate Body of the WTO found that the FSC provisions of U.S. law constituted a prohibited export subsidy under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Uruguay Round code on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. In 2000, the U.S. Congress enacted the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, (ETI) repealing sections 921 through 927 of the Internal Revenue Code dealing with FSCs. The Act included new laws, however, to exclude extraterritorial income from taxation (the Extraterritorial income exclusion).

The European Union (EU) challenged ETI in 2001, claiming the new law did not properly implement the earlier WTO decision. The EU argued that the ETI effectively retained the export subsidy, albeit under a different name. The WTO found the ETI to be a prohibited export subsidy. The United States did not meet the deadline to implement this decision and, on 30 August 30, 2002, the WTO approved the European Union request for over US$4 billion in retaliatory tariffs. Most observers viewed it as unlikely that the European Union would implement the sanctions, since the disruption that would be caused to transatlantic trade would rebound on European companies; it is likely rather than the EU will seek to use the threat of sanctions as a bargaining chip to obtain concessions from the US in other areas.

In &quot;Ford Motor Co. v. United States&quot;, 132 Fed.Cl. 104, 110 (2017), the U.S. Court of Federal Claims stated:In 1971, Congress “provided special tax treatment for export sales made by an American manufacturer through a subsidiary that qualified as a ‘domestic international sales corporation’ (DISC).” Boeing Co. v. United States, 537 U.S. 437, 440 (2003) (footnote omitted). That authority was largely replaced by provisions regarding foreign sales corporations (“FSC”), id. at 442, as set forth in the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-369, Title VIII, § 801(a), 98 Stat. 494, 985 (codified at I.R.C. §§ 921-27, repealed by the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-519, § 2, 114 Stat. 2423). A qualifying FSC presented tax advantages for its parent company within the United States because a portion of the FSC’s export income was exempt from taxation. See Staff of S. Comm. on Finance, Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, Explanation of Provisions Approved by the Committee on March 21, 1984, S. Print No. 98-169, Vol. I, at 636; see also I.R.C. §§ 921(a), 923 (specifying the particular portion of a FSC’s foreign trade income that would be excluded from gross income). The parent company of a FSC could use those tax benefits by selling its products to the FSC for resale in foreign markets, or by paying the FSC a commission for selling the parent’s products in foreign markets. See I.R.C. §§ 925(a), (b)(1); Abbott Labs. v. United States, 84 Fed. Cl. 96, 102 (2008) (detailing the FSC scheme), aff’d, 573 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The remaining foreign trade income that was not exempt from taxation, when distributed to a parent company as a dividend, would generally not be subject to an additional tax on that distribution. See I.R.C. § 245(c)(1)(A). “The net effect of this scheme was to shift a prescribed amount of profit on export sales from an entity with a 35 percent effective tax rate to an entity (the FSC) with an effective tax rate of approximately 12 percent.” Abbott Labs., 84 Fed. Cl. at 100 (citing Staff of Joint Comm. on Taxation, 98th Congress, General Explanation of the Revenue Provisions of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Comm. Print 1984), at 1045).

<text>Sketchpad (a.k.a. Robot Draftsman) is a computer program written by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the Turing Award in 1988, and the Kyoto Prize in 2012. It pioneered human–computer interaction (HCI), and is considered the ancestor of modern computer-aided design (CAD) programs and as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general. For example, Sketchpad inspired the graphical user interface (GUI) and object-oriented programming. Using the program, Sutherland showed that computer graphics could be used for both artistic and technical purposes and for demonstrating a novel method of human–computer interaction.

== History ==
See History of the graphical user interface for a more detailed discussion of GUI development.

== Software ==
Sketchpad was the earliest program ever to use a complete graphical user interface.

The clever way the program organizes its geometric data pioneered the use of &quot;master&quot; (objects) and &quot;occurrences&quot; (instances) in computing and pointed forward to object-oriented programming. The main idea was to have master drawings which can be instantiated into many duplicates. When a master drawing is changed, then all instances change also.

Geometric constraints was another major invention in Sketchpad, letting a user easily constrain geometric properties in the drawing: for instance, the length of a line or the angle between two lines could be fixed.

As a trade magazine said, clearly Sutherland &quot;broke new ground in 3D computer modeling and visual simulation, the basis for computer graphics and CAD/CAM&quot;. Very few programs can be called precedents for his achievements. Patrick J. Hanratty is sometimes called the &quot;father of CAD/CAM&quot; and wrote PRONTO, a numerical control language at General Electric in 1957, and wrote CAD software while working for General Motors beginning in 1961. Sutherland wrote in his thesis that Bolt, Beranek and Newman had a &quot;similar program&quot; and T-Square was developed by Peter Samson and one or more fellow MIT students in 1962, both for the PDP-1.

The Computer History Museum holds program listings for Sketchpad.

==Hardware==
Sketchpad ran on the MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 (1958) computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which had 64k of 36-bit words. The user drew on the computer monitor screen with the recently invented light pen, which relayed information on its position by computing at what time the light from the scanning cathode-ray tube screen is detected. 

To configure the initial position of the light pen, the word codice_1 was displayed on the screen, which, upon tapping, initialised the program with a white cross to continue keeping track of the pen&#x27;s movement relative to its prior position. Of the 36 bits available to store each display spot in the display file, 20 gave the coordinates of that spot for the display system and the remaining 16 gave the address of the n-component element responsible for adding that spot to display.

The TX-2 was an experimental machine and the hardware changed often (on Wednesdays, according to Sutherland). By 1975, the light pen and the cathode-ray tube with which it had been used had been removed.

== Publications ==
The Sketchpad program was part and parcel of Sutherland&#x27;s Ph.D. thesis at MIT and peripherally related to the Computer-Aided Design project at that time.
&quot;Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System&quot;.

<doc id="78127" wikidata="Q318412" url="?curid=78127" title="James Doohan">
<text>James Montgomery Doohan (; March 3, 1920 – July 20, 2005) was a Canadian actor, best known for his role as Montgomery &quot;Scotty&quot; Scott in the television and film series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Doohan&#x27;s characterization of the Scottish chief engineer of the Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; has become one of the most recognizable elements in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, and inspired many fans to pursue careers in engineering and other technical fields. He also made contributions behind the scenes, such as the initial development of the Klingon and Vulcan languages.

Prior to his acting career, Doohan served in the 14th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. He also served as an Artillery Forward Observation Officer (FOO) and pilot. He saw combat in Europe during World War II, including the D-Day invasion of Normandy, in which he was wounded, apparently by friendly fire. After the war, he had extensive experience performing in radio and television, which led to his role as Scotty. Following the cancellation of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, Doohan was typecast and had limited success in finding other roles; he returned to play the character in the animated and film continuations of the series, and made frequent appearances at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions.

==Early life==
Doohan was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, the youngest of four children of William Patrick Doohan and Sarah Frances (née Montgomery), who both emigrated from Bangor, Ireland. His father, William Doohan, was born in Belfast, and was a pharmacist, veterinarian and dentist, and a member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland. William Doohan owned a chemist shop in Main Street in Bangor beside Trinity Presbyterian Church and reportedly invented an early form of high-octane gasoline in 1923. Doohan&#x27;s 1996 autobiography recounted his father&#x27;s serious alcoholism.

The family moved from Vancouver to Sarnia, Ontario. Doohan attended high school at Sarnia Collegiate Institute and Technical School, where he excelled in mathematics and science. He enrolled in the 102nd Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps in 1938.

==Military service==
In 1939, Doohan enlisted in the Royal Canadian Artillery, 14th (Midland) Field Battery of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. From there, he was moved to the 13th Field Regiment of the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division in their 22nd Field Battery. By 1940 he was a Lieutenant and was sent to train in Britain prior to Operation Overlord. He first saw combat landing in the 2nd Wave in a Recce Party at Juno Beach on D-Day. The 13th Field Regiment was interspersed with the Regina Rifle Regiment landing at &quot;Nan&quot; Sector of Juno Beach. After shooting two snipers, Doohan led his men to higher ground through a field of anti-tank mines, where they took defensive positions for the night. Crossing between command posts at 23:30 that night, Doohan was hit by six rounds fired from a Bren gun by a nervous Canadian sentry: four in his leg, one in the chest, and one through his right middle finger. The bullet to his chest was stopped by a silver cigarette case given to him by his brother. His right middle finger had to be amputated, something he would conceal on-screen during most of his career as an actor, sometimes with a flesh-colored glove with a &quot;faux finger.&quot;

Doohan graduated from Air Observation Pilot Course 40 with eleven other Canadian artillery officers and flew Taylorcraft Auster Mark V aircraft for 666 (AOP) Squadron, RCAF as a Royal Canadian Artillery officer in support of 1st Army Group Royal Canadian Artillery. All three Canadian (AOP) RCAF squadrons were crewed by artillery officer-pilots and accompanied by non-commissioned RCA and RCAF personnel serving as observers. Although he was never actually a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Doohan was once labelled the &quot;craziest pilot in the Canadian Air Force&quot;. In the late spring of 1945, on Salisbury Plain north of RAF Andover, he slalomed a plane between telegraph poles &quot;to prove it could be done&quot;, earning himself a serious reprimand. (Various accounts cite the plane as a Hurricane or a jet trainer; however, it was an Auster Mark IV.)

==Early acting career==
After the war, Doohan moved to London, Ontario, for further technical education. After hearing a radio drama and believing he could do better, he recorded his voice at the local radio station, and learned about the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. There he won a two-year scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City, where his classmates included Leslie Nielsen, Tony Randall, and Richard Boone.

In 1946, he had several roles for CBC radio, starting January 12. For several years, he shuttled between Toronto and New York as work demanded. He made his TV debut as a detective on the show &quot;Martin Kane, Private Eye&quot;, and appeared in 54 episodes. He estimated he performed in over 4,000 radio programs and 450 television programs during this period, and earned a reputation for versatility.

In the mid-1950s, he appeared as forest ranger Timber Tom (the northern counterpart of Buffalo Bob) in the Canadian version of &quot;Howdy Doody&quot;. Coincidentally, fellow &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast member William Shatner appeared simultaneously as Ranger Bill in the American version. Doohan and Shatner both appeared in the 1950s Canadian science fiction series &quot;Space Command&quot;. Doohan also appeared in several episodes of &quot;Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans&quot; in 1957–58.

For &quot;GM Presents&quot;, he played the lead role in the CBC Television drama &quot;Flight into Danger&quot; (1956) by Arthur Hailey, then in &quot;The Night they Killed Joe Howe&quot; (1960). (Arthur Hailey rewrote the former into the novel &quot;Runway Zero-Eight&quot;, then adapted to &quot;Terror in the Sky&quot;. This story was later satirized in &quot;Airplane!&quot;.)

Doohan&#x27;s credits included &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (Season 4, Episode 3 &quot;Valley of the Shadow&quot; - 17 January 1961), &quot;GE True&quot;, &quot;Hazel&quot; (&quot;Hazel&#x27;s Highland Fling&quot; as Gordon &quot;Gordy&quot; MacHeath). &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (Season 1, Episode 4 &quot;The Shark Affair&quot; - 1964 - and Season 2, Episode 20 &quot;The Bridge of Lions Affair, Part 1&quot; - 1966), and &quot;Bonanza&quot;. In the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;Gift of Water&quot; (1962), he co-starred with actress Majel Barrett who would later play &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s Nurse Christine Chapel. He played an assistant to the United States president in two episodes of &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;. He had an uncredited role in &quot;The Satan Bug&quot; (1965), appeared in the &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; episode &quot;A Perilous Passage&quot; (1970), appeared as a state trooper in Roger Vadim&#x27;s film &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot; (1971, which was produced by &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry), and played opposite Richard Harris in the movie &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; (1971).

==&quot;Star Trek&quot;==

Doohan developed a talent for accents as a child. Auditioning for the role of chief engineer of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Doohan did several different accents. Producer Gene Roddenberry asked which he preferred, and Doohan replied, &quot;If you want an engineer, in my experience the best engineers are Scotsmen.&quot; He chose the name &quot;Montgomery Scott&quot; after his grandfather. In later years, Doohan reenacted the casting process at Star Trek conventions, demonstrating a variety of possible voices and characters.

Doohan was quoted as saying, &quot;Scotty is ninety-nine percent James Doohan and one percent accent.&quot; The character was originally conceived as semi-regular; but was elevated to be a regular supporting character. Doohan also provided voices for inanimate characters, including Sargon in &quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot;, the M-5 in &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;, the Mission Control Voice in &quot;&quot;, and the Oracle in &quot;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot;.

Doohan returned to the role of Scotty in the early 1970s for &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. Walter Koenig (navigator Pavel Chekov) was not hired for this series due to budget limitations, so Doohan voiced a replacement character: alien navigator Arex. He also voiced most guest male roles, including that of Robert April, the first captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and around 50 other roles, voicing as many as seven different characters in a single episode.

He rejoined the entire regular cast of &quot;Star Trek&quot; for the feature film &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), for which he also devised the Vulcan and Klingon language dialogue. He continued in the role of Scotty for sequels &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, &quot;The Search for Spock&quot;, &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;, &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; and &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;. In 1992, he guest-starred in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Relics&quot;, playing an elderly Scotty reminiscing about his time on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. He and Walter Koenig appeared briefly with William Shatner in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, in a scene which transitioned the film series to the newer cast of the first of the later television series in the franchise.

==After &quot;Star Trek&quot;==
Doohan hoped that &quot;Star Trek&quot; would benefit his acting career. After the series ended, however, he found himself typecast and had a hard time gaining other roles. After his dentist reminded him he would &quot;always be Scotty&quot;, he supported his family with income from personal appearances.

Most of the roles Doohan subsequently played made at least oblique references to his &quot;Star Trek&quot; connection and engineering reputation. He was Commander Canarvin in the short-lived Saturday morning live-action kids&#x27; show &quot;Jason of Star Command&quot;, and had a cameo in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot; as &quot;Jimmy Doohan, the guy who played Scotty on &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;. On the television series &quot;Homeboys in Outer Space&quot;, he was Pippen, a pun on Scotty and basketball star Scottie Pippen. He played himself in an episode of &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot;. He played Damon Warwick, father of James Warwick, on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. After learning about cold fusion from technical journals in 1989, he narrated the video &quot;Cold Fusion: Fire from Water&quot;, about the physics behind cold fusion.

When the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise was revived, Doohan reprised his role of Scotty in seven &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. Many of Doohan&#x27;s film appearances centred on the role of Scotty, such as a cameo in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Loaded Weapon 1&quot;, where he plays a policeman doing repair work who tells his superior officer &quot;I am giving it all she has got, Captain!&quot; in the same accent he used in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Although he continued to work with William Shatner in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, Doohan did not get along well with him and was once quoted in 1998 as saying, &quot;I like Captain Kirk, but I sure don&#x27;t like Bill.&quot; He was the only former &quot;Star Trek&quot; co-star to decline to be interviewed by Shatner for Shatner&#x27;s first &quot;Star Trek: Memories&quot; book about the show, nor did he consent to do so for Shatner&#x27;s follow-up book, &quot;Star Trek: Movie Memories&quot;, though Shatner claimed in the latter that the icy relationship between the two started to thaw when both men were working on &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; in 1993–94. By Doohan&#x27;s final August 2004 convention appearance, Doohan and Shatner reportedly had mended their relationship.

==Inspiration==
Many fans told Doohan over the years that it was he who inspired them to choose engineering as a profession. Astronaut Neil Armstrong, an engineer before he participated in NASA&#x27;s Apollo program, becoming the first man on the moon, personally told Doohan on stage at Doohan&#x27;s last public appearance in 2004, &quot;From one old engineer to another, thanks, mate.&quot;

In an interview for the first &quot;Trekkies&quot; film, Doohan related the story of a young fan who was contemplating suicide. Doohan says that he convinced her to attend his next convention appearance, and later learned that his encouragement and kind words had not only saved her life, but inspired her to go back to school and become an electronics engineer.

==Personal life==

Doohan was married three times and had seven children, four of themincluding Christopherwith his first wife Janet Young, whom he divorced in 1964. His marriage to Anita Yagel in 1967–72 produced no children. In early 1974, he was introduced to 17-year-old fan Wende Braunberger at a theatre performance. They were married that same year, when he was 54 and she was 18, on October 12, 1974. &quot;Star Trek&quot; guest actor William Campbell served as best man. Doohan and Braunberger had three children: Eric, Thomas, and Sarah in April 2000, around his 80th birthday. In his later years, Doohan had a multitude of health problems partially from his lifestyle, which included prodigious alcohol consumption, and partially from injuries sustained during World War II. These included diabetes, liver cirrhosis, osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, and hearing loss. In July 2004, his suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease caused him to withdraw from public life.

His sons Montgomery and Christopher appeared in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979). Christopher also appeared in the J. J. Abrams reboot &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009). Simon Pegg, who played Scotty in the film, invited Chris and his family to the premiere. For &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; in 2012, fans campaigned for Christopher Doohan gaining him a credited cameo in the transporter room. Chris Doohan played Scotty in the award-winning web series &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot;.

==Death==
On July 20, 2005, at 5:30 in the morning, Doohan died at his home in Redmond, Washington, due to complications of pulmonary fibrosis, which was believed to be from exposure to noxious substances during World War II. His body was subsequently cremated.
A portion of his ashes, ¼ ounce (7 grams), was scheduled the following fall for a memorial flight to space with 308 others, including Project Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper. Launch on the SpaceLoft XL rocket was delayed to April 28, 2007, when the rocket briefly entered outer space in a four-minute suborbital flight before parachuting to earth, as planned, with the ashes still inside. The ashes were subsequently launched on a Falcon 1 rocket, on August 3, 2008, into what was intended to be a low Earth orbit; however, the rocket failed two minutes after launch. Some of Doohan&#x27;s ashes are hidden under the floor cladding of the International Space Station&#x27;s Columbus module – after being smuggled aboard in 2008 by Richard Garriott. The rest of Doohan&#x27;s ashes were scattered over Puget Sound in Washington. On May 22, 2012, a small urn containing some of Doohan&#x27;s ashes was flown into space aboard the Falcon 9 rocket as part of COTS Demo Flight 2.

==Legacy==

Scotty&#x27;s exploits as the &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s redoubtable chief engineer inspired many students to pursue careers in engineering. Because of this, the Milwaukee School of Engineering presented Doohan with an honorary degree in engineering. Doohan received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 31, 2004. Despite his ill health, he was present at the ceremony, which was his final public appearance.

Montgomery Scott was claimed by Linlithgow, Scotland, in 2007 by a commemorative plaque from the West Lothian Council for Doohan&#x27;s importance. His birthplace is also attributed to Aberdeen, where Doohan learned the doric accent, or Elgin. In the actual show, Scotty refers to himself as a one-time &quot;Aberdeen pub-crawler&quot;, the only reference Doohan&#x27;s character ever makes to a specific place in Scotland where he lived. However, Scotty&#x27;s accent chosen by Doohan is not the relatively harsh Aberdonian accent; the specific accent Doohan used implies most of Scotty&#x27;s formative years were spent at or near Edinburgh, something that is supported by original script notes.

<text>The New Jersey Turnpike (NJTP) is a system of controlled-access toll roads in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The turnpike is maintained by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. The mainline&#x27;s southern terminus is at the Delaware Memorial Bridge on I-295 in Pennsville. Its northern terminus is at an interchange with US 46 in Ridgefield Park. Construction of the mainline, from concept to completion, took a total of 22 months between 1950 and 1951. It was opened to traffic on November 5, 1951, between its southern terminus and exit 10.

The turnpike is a major thoroughfare providing access to various localities in New Jersey, and the toll road provides a direct bypass southeast of Philadelphia for long-distance travelers between New York City and Washington, D.C. According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the turnpike is the nation&#x27;s sixth-busiest toll road, and one of the most heavily traveled highways in the nation.

The northern part of the mainline turnpike, along with the entirety of its extensions and spurs, is a part of the Interstate Highway System designated as I-95 between exit 6 in Mansfield Township, and its northern end near New York City. South of exit 6, it has the unsigned Route 700 designation. There are three extensions and two spurs, including the Newark Bay Extension at exit 14, which carries I-78; the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension, officially known as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension, at exit 6, which carries I-95 off the mainline turnpike; the Eastern Spur and the Western Spur, which split traffic between Newark and Ridgefield; and the I-95 Extension, which continues the mainline to the George Washington Bridge approach in Fort Lee. All segments (excluding the I-95 Extension) are toll roads.

The route is divided into four roadways between exit 6 and exit 14. The inner lanes are generally restricted to cars, while the outer lanes are open to cars, trucks, and buses. The turnpike has lanes, shoulders, and 13 of the highway&#x27;s service areas are named after notable New Jersey residents. The Interstate Highway System took some of its design guidelines from those of the turnpike. The turnpike has been referenced many times in music, film, and television.

== Route description ==
The mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike splits from I-295 in Pennsville Township and runs along a north-northeast route to I-80 and US 46 in Ridgefield Park, where it continues north as I-95. It is designated Route 700, an unsigned route, from exit 1 (Delaware Memorial Bridge) to exit 6, and as I-95 from exit 6 (Mansfield Township) to exit 18 (Secaucus–Carlstadt). The number of lanes ranges from four lanes south of exit 4 (Mount Laurel), six lanes between exit 4 and exit 6 (Mansfield Township), 12 lanes between exit 6 and exit 11 (Woodbridge Township), and 14 lanes between exit 11 and exit 14 (Newark). The default speed limit is between the southern terminus and milepost 97, and from there to the northern terminus. The Newark Bay Extension carries a limit. The turnpike has variable speed limit signs allowing for the limit to be lowered temporarily during unusual road conditions.

Before the advent of the Interstate Highway System, the entire Turnpike was designated by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) as Route 700. The Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension was Route 700P, and the Newark Bay Extension was Route 700N. None of these state highway designations have been signed. The entire length of the New Jersey Turnpike is part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

=== Pennsville Township to Springfield Township ===

The turnpike&#x27;s southern terminus lies at the Delaware Memorial Bridge in Pennsville Township, running concurrently with I-295 and US 40. Immediately after an interchange that provides access to Route 49 and US 130, US 40 and the turnpike split from I-295. A short distance later, in Carneys Point Township, the turnpike enters an interchange with Route 140 and County Route 540 (CR 540). Through this section, the turnpike has three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. The turnpike loses its third northbound lane, and continues on with two lanes in each direction and a speed limit. After crossing over Game Creek, the turnpike reaches the exit 1 toll plaza, where northbound drivers must obtain a ticket, and southbound drivers must surrender their ticket and pay the proper toll. Two Express E-ZPass lanes are provided in each direction. Paralleling I-295, the turnpike continues east-northeast through rural Salem County with two lanes in each direction. After passing under Route 48, the turnpike enters Oldmans Township, where it has the John Fenwick Service Area northbound and the Clara Barton Service Area southbound. The turnpike then briefly enters Pilesgrove Township before crossing the Oldmans Creek into Woolwich Township.
Continuing northeast, the turnpike crosses the SMS Rail Lines&#x27; Salem Branch before passing to the south of Swedesboro. After crossing the Raccoon Creek, the highway reaches an interchange for US 322. A maintenance yard is present on the northbound side of the turnpike immediately north of the interchange into Harrison Township. The route heads northeast into East Greenwich Township past farmland before crossing Edwards Creek. Here, the turnpike passes by residential developments and soon crosses the Mantua Creek into West Deptford Township, where it passes through parkland before development near the route increases substantially. After passing under Mantua Pike (Route 45), the turnpike enters Woodbury Heights, where it passes by homes before crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; (CSAO) Vineland Secondary and entering Deptford Township. Here, the turnpike passes under Route 47 before crossing the Big Timber Creek. Immediately northeast of this point, the turnpike passes under the Route 42 freeway and enters the Camden County borough of Bellmawr. After passing to the south of an industrial park, the turnpike enters Runnemede and comes to an exit for Black Horse Pike (Route 168), serving the city of Camden to the north and providing access to the Atlantic City Expressway to the south. Immediately after the interchange, the turnpike crosses back into Bellmawr before entering Barrington, where it passes under Route 41/CR 573. The turnpike then passes near packaging plants before entering Lawnside and crossing over White Horse Pike (US 30).

Still two lanes in each direction, the turnpike continues northeast past a warehouse and eventually comes within yards of I-295. Upon entering Cherry Hill, the turnpike passes over tracks carrying the PATCO Speedline and NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line before reaching the Walt Whitman Service Area along the southbound lanes. Continuing northeast, the turnpike passes under Route 70 before crossing the Pennsauken Creek into Mount Laurel, Burlington County, where it has an exit for Route 73. North of this point, the turnpike has three lanes in each direction. Still running within close proximity of I-295, the turnpike comes to a New Jersey State Police station and passes under Route 38 before crossing CSAO&#x27;s Pemberton Industrial Track. After the northbound James Fenimore Cooper Service Area, the road crosses over Rancocas Creek and passes to the northwest of Rancocas State Park. Now in Westampton Township, the distance between I-295 and the turnpike increases, and the turnpike reaches an exit for Burlington-Mount Holly Road (CR 541). Northeast of this point, the turnpike continues as a six-lane highway into Burlington Township, where it passes by houses and the Burlington Country Club before entering Springfield Township. Here, the turnpike passes by agricultural areas before crossing Assiscunk Creek.

===Mansfield Township to Newark===

Now in Mansfield Township, the turnpike splits into a &quot;dual-dual&quot; configuration similar to a local-express configuration. The outer lanes are open to all vehicles and the inner lanes are limited to cars only, unless signed otherwise because of unusual conditions. The turnpike now has a total of 12 lanes, six in each direction (3-3-3-3). Just north of the split is an interchange with the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension, where the turnpike mainline becomes concurrent with I-95. North of this point, the turnpike enters Bordentown Township and has an exit for US 206. Continuing northeast, the turnpike passes by a mix of residential neighborhoods and farmland and enters Chesterfield Township before passing over Crosswicks Creek and entering Hamilton Township in Mercer County. The highway then reaches the Woodrow Wilson and Richard Stockton service areas on the southbound and northbound sides, respectively. After the service areas, the turnpike enters Robbinsville Township and reaches an exit for I-195, an east–west freeway connecting the state capital of Trenton with the Jersey Shore. North of I-195, the turnpike passes to the west of several warehouses and traverses numerous parks and wooded areas. After crossing Assunpink Creek, the turnpike enters East Windsor Township, where the road changes its course to a slightly more northerly path. Near Hightstown is an exit for Route 133, which connects the turnpike with and provides a bypass for Route 33 in the area. North of here, the turnpike crosses the Millstone River into Cranbury Township, Middlesex County, and passes more warehouses on both sides of the road in addition to the southbound Molly Pitcher Service Area. After entering Monroe Township, the turnpike has a modified trumpet interchange with Route 32 serving Jamesburg. The interchange has a ramp for traffic seeking Route 32 eastbound forming an &quot;S&quot; shape, taking traffic to Cranbury South River Road. Upon crossing into South Brunswick, the turnpike crosses CSAO&#x27;s Amboy Secondary and passes by more industrial parks. The highway then enters East Brunswick, where suburban development along the corridor greatly increases, indicating the entrance to the built-up portion of the New York metropolitan area. Continuing north, the turnpike passes to the east of a golf course and has the northbound Joyce Kilmer Service Area. The route briefly enters Milltown before crossing back into East Brunswick, where it passes by many homes before reaching an exit for Route 18 serving the county seat of New Brunswick. After Route 18, the turnpike enters New Brunswick and crosses over the Raritan River on the Basilone Memorial Bridge into Edison. The structure honors John Basilone, a Raritan resident who is the only United States Marine to be honored with the Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross and the Purple Heart. He died in the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945.
After crossing the Raritan River, the turnpike passes by several warehouses and industrial parks before crossing CSAO&#x27;s Bonhamtown Industrial Track line and reaching an exit serving I-287 and Route 440. Soon afterwards, the turnpike passes over the Middlesex Greenway and enters Woodbridge Township, where it reaches an exit serving the Garden State Parkway and US 9. North of this interchange is the headquarters of the NJTA. From Woodbridge Township to Newark, high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) exist on the outer roadway (truck lanes), thereby making it seven lanes in each direction (4-3-3-4). The HOV restrictions are in effect on weekdays, from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. northbound, and 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. southbound (at times, the NJTA might suspend the HOV restrictions entirely during peak hours in case of unusual conditions). Continuing northeast, the turnpike passes under Amboy Avenue (Route 35) and crosses NJ Transit&#x27;s North Jersey Coast Line. Past this point, the turnpike crosses the Woodbridge River and reaches the Grover Cleveland Service Area northbound and the Thomas Edison Service Area southbound. After passing over CSAO&#x27;s Port Reading Secondary line, the turnpike enters Carteret and begins to run parallel to CSAO&#x27;s Chemical Coast Secondary line, which is located east of the turnpike. In Carteret, the highway comes to an interchange serving the borough in addition to Rahway. Immediately north of the interchange, the Wallberg-Lovely Memorial Bridge carries the turnpike over the Rahway River. The bridge is dedicated to Private Martin Wallberg from Westfield, and Private Luke Lovely from, South Amboy, the first soldiers from New Jersey to die in World War I. In Linden, the turnpike passes to the east of a large industrial park before reaching an exit for I-278, which traverses the nearby Goethals Bridge. North of this point, the speed limit drops to , and the turnpike crosses the Elizabeth River into the city of Elizabeth. After bisecting residential areas, the route comes to an exit for the Route 81 freeway, providing access to Newark Liberty International Airport. While passing to the east of the airport and Brewster Road, the turnpike also passes to the west of the Elizabeth Center big-box center and the Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal upon entering Newark. A section of the turnpike and the surrounding land in Elizabeth and Newark has been called &quot;the most dangerous two miles in America&quot; by New Jersey Homeland Security officials due to the high volume of traffic and the density of potential terrorist targets in the surrounding area.

=== Newark to Ridgefield Park ===
 After reaching the north end of the airport, the HOV lanes end, and the turnpike comes to an interchange with I-78, which is also the Newark Bay Extension of the turnpike east of the mainline. North of I-78, the turnpike passes over CSAO&#x27;s Chemical Coast Secondary, Greenville Running Track, and National Docks Branch at the Oak Island Yard. At this point, the car-truck lane configuration ends, and the turnpike splits into two spurs: the Eastern Spur (the original roadway) and the Western Spur (opened in 1970). Both are signed as I-95. The Western Spur is posted for through traffic on I-95 seeking I-280 and the George Washington Bridge, while traffic seeking US 46, I-80, and the Lincoln Tunnel is routed via the Eastern Spur. NJDOT, which calls every class of highway &quot;Route&quot;, calls the Western Spur &quot;Route 95W&quot;. The NJTA refers to the complex series of roadways and ramps linking the car–truck lanes, the two spurs, as well as traffic heading to and from I-78 as the &quot;Southern Mixing Bowl&quot;. Both spurs have an exit for US 1/9 Truck and pass under the Pulaski Skyway (US 1/9) at this point before crossing over CSAO&#x27;s Passaic and Harsimus Line, and will meet up at US 46 and I-80 to continue to the George Washington Bridge where the Turnpike will eventually end.

====Eastern Spur====

The Eastern Spur crosses the Passaic River on the Chaplain Washington Bridge, which honors Rev. John P. Washington who gave up his life jacket and died as the &quot;SS Dorchester&quot; sank on February 3, 1943. After crossing over tracks carrying PATH&#x27;s Newark–World Trade Center line, NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris &amp; Essex Lines, and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, the spur surfaces into Kearny, Hudson County, as a six-lane highway, and has a partial interchange with I-280, containing only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Past this point, the spur passes over Route 7 and crosses the Hackensack River on the Lewandowski Hackensack River Bridge. The bridge was named in honor of the three Lewandowski brothers, Army Private Alexander, Marine Sergeant Walter and Air Force Lieutenant William, who were killed in action during World War II within 18 months of each other. The turnpike then enters Secaucus and crosses the railroad right-of-way of the future Essex-Hudson Greenway and runs along the east side of Snake Hill. It then passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s Main Line at Secaucus Junction station, which serves NJ Transit trains running along the Northeast Corridor and the Main Line. After the southbound lanes have the Alexander Hamilton Service Area, the turnpike reaches the exit 18E toll plaza, serving as the northern end of the ticket system. Immediately afterwards is an interchange with Route 495 and Route 3, providing access to the Lincoln Tunnel. After passing through swampland in the Meadowlands, the spur crosses into Ridgefield, Bergen County. Here, the Eastern Spur comes to the northernmost service area on the turnpike, the Vince Lombardi Service Area. After passing over the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line and CSX&#x27;s River Subdivision line, the highway merges back together with the Western Spur as it passes east of PSE&amp;G&#x27;s Bergen Generating Station and crosses Overpeck Creek into Ridgefield Park, where the turnpike comes to its original northern terminus at US 46.

====Western Spur====
The Harry Laderman Bridge, named after the first turnpike employee killed on the job, carries the Western Spur over the Passaic River and then tracks carrying PATH&#x27;s Newark–World Trade Center line, NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris &amp; Essex Lines, and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. Running north with six lanes, the Western Spur has a full interchange with I-280 before crossing over Route 7 and the former Boonton Line. The spur then enters Lyndhurst and crosses NJ Transit&#x27;s Main Line and Berrys Creek before passing over NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line and entering East Rutherford. Here, the Western Spur has a junction with Route 3, where it loses a lane in each direction. The highway reaches the exit 18W toll plaza before passing by the Meadowlands Sports Complex and the American Dream shopping and entertainment complex, which are served by a southbound exit and northbound entrance with connections to Route 120 and CR 503 via Route 3. After crossing the Hackensack River, the Western Spur has access to the Vince Lombardi Service Area before crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway&#x27;s New Jersey Subdivision line and CSX&#x27;s River Subdivision line and merging with the Eastern Spur.

=== Extensions ===

The turnpike has three extensions; the first, the -long Newark Bay Extension, opened in 1956, and is part of Interstate 78. It connects Newark with Lower Manhattan via the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City and intersects the mainline near Newark Liberty International Airport. This extension has three exits (exits 14A, 14B, and 14C), and due to its design (four lanes with a shoulderless Jersey barrier divider), has a speed limit. The extension traverses the Newark Bay Bridge (officially the Vincent R. Casciano Memorial Bridge), which is a steel cantilever bridge spanning Newark Bay and connecting Newark and Bayonne. Dubbed the &quot;world&#x27;s most expensive road&quot; by &quot;The Jersey Journal&quot;, it was completed April 4, 1956. Casciano was a state assemblyman and a lifetime resident of Bayonne.

The second extension, known as the Pearl Harbor Memorial Turnpike Extension (or Pennsylvania Turnpike Connector), carries I-95 off the mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike at exit 6 and connects to the Pennsylvania Turnpike via the Delaware River–Turnpike Toll Bridge, a continuous truss bridge spanning the Delaware River. This extension, and the Delaware River Bridge, were opened to traffic on May 25, 1956. A , six-lane highway, it has an exit, designated as 6A, to US 130 near Florence. The extension was formerly designated as Route 700P, but was officially designated as I-95 after the Somerset Freeway was cancelled, and was signed as such when the first components of the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate 95 Interchange Project were completed on September 22, 2018.

The third extension, the stretch of I-95 north of US 46 came under NJTA jurisdiction in 1992, as NJDOT sold the road to balance the state budget, and it is not tolled. This section of the road – known as the I-95 Extension – extends the mainline to travel past the interchange for I-80 in Teaneck where the original terminus was, and through a cut in the Hudson Palisades to the George Washington Bridge Plaza in Fort Lee. The NJDOT originally built a &quot;missing link&quot; in between U.S. 46 and I-80, then a connector highway from I-80 to the George Washington Bridge, prior to being sold to the NJTA. Even though it was not constructed when the Turnpike first opened, the I-95 Extension is still considered to be a part of the mainline, not just a spur like the Newark Bay or Pennsylvania Turnpike extensions are, despite it not being tolled. It also passes under the Edgewood Road Bridge in Leonia, a high overpass known for its scenery for long-distance travelers entering New Jersey. The turnpike terminates at US 9W (exit 72), with the final approaches to the George Washington Bridge along I-95 maintained by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Signs saying &quot;Turnpike Entrance&quot; southbound past I-80 mean entering the tolled parts of the Turnpike. Exit numbers along this section follow the mile markers I-95 would have had if the Somerset Freeway was built.
== Services ==
===Service areas===


Along with the Garden State Parkway, the New Jersey Turnpike is noted for naming its service areas after notable New Jersey residents.

Turnpike service areas consist mostly of fast-food restaurants operated by Iris Buyer LLC (Applegreen). Each rest area also includes restrooms, water fountains, a Sunoco gas station with a small convenience store, with gas price signs posted about half a mile (0.8 km) before reaching the rest area, and a separate parking area for cars and trucks. Some have a dedicated bus parking area, Wi-Fi, and a gift shop as well.

Before 1982, there was a service area on the northbound side named for Admiral William Halsey. However, in 1982, exit 13A was created, which caused the obscuring of the rest area, as they both overlapped with each other. Anyone who wanted to get to the service area missed exiting at exit 13A, and (northbound) drivers who took that exit missed that service area. The service area closed permanently on June 4, 1994. Today, it can be seen by motorists when exiting 13A from the northbound car lanes, where a temporary concrete barrier obstructs an open asphalt lot.

Two service areas were located on the Newark Bay Extension (one eastbound and one westbound) located west of exit 14B. These were closed in the early 1970s. The eastbound service area was named for John Stevens, the westbound service area for Peter Stuyvesant.

In late March 2010, it was revealed that the state Transportation Commissioner was considering selling the naming rights of the rest areas to help address a budget shortfall.

The Grover Cleveland Service Area in Woodbridge was temporarily closed because of storm damage from Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, with only fuel available. It was rebuilt and fully reopened on November 23, 2015. In 2015, the NJTA installed Tesla Supercharger stations in the Molly Pitcher and Joyce Kilmer service areas to allow Tesla car owners to charge their vehicles. A proposal to offer charging stations for non-Tesla vehicles is also under consideration.

=== Emergency assistance ===
The NJTA offers shoulders wherever possible, and disabled vehicle service may be obtained by dialing #95 on a cellular phone. Towing and roadside assistance are provided from authorized garages. The New Jersey State Police is the primary police agency that handles calls for service on the turnpike. New Jersey State Police Troop D serves the New Jersey Turnpike, with stations in Cranbury, Moorestown, and Newark. Other emergency services such as fire and first aid are usually handled by the jurisdictions in which that section of the turnpike passes.

==History==
=== Precursors and planning ===
Route 100 and Route 300 were two state highways proposed in the 1930s by the New Jersey State Highway Department as precursors to the New Jersey Turnpike.

The road that is now the New Jersey Turnpike was first planned by the State Highway Department as two freeways in 1938. Route 100 was the route from New Brunswick to the George Washington Bridge, plus a spur to the Holland Tunnel, now the Newark Bay Extension of the Turnpike. Route 300 was the southern part of the turnpike from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to New Brunswick. However, the State Highway Department did not have the funds to complete the two freeways, and very little of the road was built under its auspices. Instead, in 1948, the NJTA was created to build the road, and the two freeways were built as a single toll road.

Route S100 was a proposed spur of Route 100 in Elizabeth. It was never built, although Route 81 follows a similar alignment.
According to a letter to the editor written by Kathleen Troast Pitney, the daughter of Paul L. Troast, the first chairman of the NJTA:
A brochure &quot;Interesting Facts about the New Jersey Turnpike&quot;, dating from soon after the road&#x27;s opening, says that when the turnpike&#x27;s bonds are paid off, &quot;the law provides that the turnpike be turned over to the state for inclusion in the public highway system&quot;. Due to new construction, and the expectation that the turnpike pays for policing and maintenance, this has never come to pass.

===Construction===

The project of building the turnpike had its challenges. One major problem was the construction in the city of Elizabeth, where either 450 homes or 32 businesses would be destroyed, depending on the chosen route. The engineers decided to go through the residential area, since they considered it the grittiest and the closest route to both Newark Airport and the Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal seaport.

When construction finally got to Newark, there was the new challenge of deciding to build either over or under the Pulaski Skyway. If construction went above the skyway, the costs would be much higher. If they went under, the costs would be lower, but the roadway would be very close to the Passaic River, making it harder for ships to pass through. The turnpike was ultimately built to pass under. As part of a 2005 seismic retrofit project, the NJTA lowered its roadway to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width shoulders, which had been constrained by the location of the skyway supports. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the bridge by , without shutting down traffic. The work was carried out by Koch Skanska in 2004, under a $35 million contract (equivalent to $ million in ). The project&#x27;s engineers were from a joint venture of Dewberry Goodkind Inc. and HNTB Corp. Temporary towers supported the bridge while bearings were removed from the 150 piers and the concrete replaced on the pier tops. The lowering process for an section of the bridge was done over 56 increments, during five weeks of work.
While continuing up to the Meadowlands, the crossings were harder because of the fertile marsh land of silt and mud. Near the shallow mud, the mud was filled with crushed stone, and the roadway was built above the water table. In the deeper mud, caissons were sunk down to a firm stratum and filled with sand, then both the caissons and the surrounding areas were covered with blankets of sand. Gradually, the water was brought up, and drained into adjacent meadows. Then, construction of the two major bridges over the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers was completed. The bridges were built to give motorists a clear view of the New York City skyline, but with high retaining walls to create the illusion of not being on a river crossing. The Passaic River (Chaplain Washington) Bridge cost $13.7 million to build; the Hackensack River Bridge cost $9.5 million.

The entire length of the New Jersey Turnpike took 25 months to construct, at a total cost of $255 million. The first stretch, from exit 1 in Carneys Point Township north to exit 5 in Westampton Township, opened on November 5, 1951. A second stretch from exit 5 north to exit 11 in Woodbridge opened on November 30, 1951, followed by a third stretch from exit 11 north to exit 15E in Newark on December 20, 1951. The fourth and final stretch, from exit 15E north to exit 18 in Ridgefield, opened on January 15, 1952, completing the turnpike. After the turnpike was completed in 1952, the NJTA and the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA) proposed a extension of the New Jersey Turnpike that would run from its end (at US 46 in Ridgefield Park at the time) up to West Nyack, New York, at I-87 (New York State Thruway). The section through New Jersey was to be constructed and maintained by the NJTA, while the section in New York was to be built and maintained by the NYSTA. The purpose of this extension was to give motorists a &quot;more direct bypass of the New York City area&quot; to New England, by using the Tappan Zee Bridge. The extension was to parallel New York State Route 303 (NY 303) and the present-day CSX River Subdivision, and have limited interchanges. It was to have an interchange with the Palisades Interstate Parkway and at I-87 (New York State Thruway) in West Nyack. This project did not survive; by 1970, it became too expensive to buy right-of-way access, and community opposition was fierce. Therefore, the NJTA and the NYSTA canceled the project. NJDOT did construct a small segment of this extension, the portion between US 46 and I-80, as part of the I-95 Extension. This segment was later transferred to the NJTA.

===1950s to 1980s===
With the turnpike completed, traffic increased beyond expectations, which prompted planning for two widenings in 1955. the first of these would widen the segment of roadway and from four lanes to an eight-lane, dual-dual setup (2-2-2-2, two express carriageways and two local carriageways in each direction) between exit 10 and exit 14. The second widening would add one lane in each direction from exit 4 and exit 10, making for a total of six lanes combined. On April 4, 1956, the widening between exit 10 and exit 14 was completed, also as part of this project, exit 14 was rebuilt from a standard exit that served US 1-9 into the Newark Bay Extension, though only the stretch between exit 14 on the mainline and exit 14A. On May 25 of that year, the widening between exit 4 and exit 10 was completed, along with this came the Pearl Harbor Memorial extension and its interchange with the mainline.

In 1958, a part of the turnpike was designated as I-95. In addition, a short part of the southern segment was signed as I-295, and the Newark Bay Extension was signed as I-78.

On May 15, 1962, the authority opened a new trumpet interchange at exit 12. The ramps, which replaced the nonstandard half diamond interchange at the location, cost $3,500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to construct, and unlike the old ramps, contained a southbound exit and northbound entrance.

On August 7, 1962, the NJTA announced a major project to replace exits 17 and 18, in addition to expanding exits 16&#x27;s toll plaza. This work was being done in preparation for the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair. It would involve moving the northern end of the ticket system from Ridgefield to Secaucus, as well as replacing the partially at-grade exits 17 with a new grade separated exits 17 in order to reduce congestion and upgrade said road to Interstate Highway standards It would also involve replacement of the exits 16 with a new 24 lane wide structure, and relocating exit 18 to be at the new northern end of the ticket system near exits 16. Construction on the new exit 17 began immediately. The original exit 17 had its northbound ramps permanently closed on June 16, 1963, to allow construction of the replacement exits 16 toll plaza to proceed. On September 19, at 3:30 Pm, the new exit 17 was completed, it contained a wider toll booth, was fully grade separated, was located slightly father to the north, and operated on a coin drop system rather tan the ticket system like the rest of the road, with trucks, buses, and trailers charged based on their weight. It was at this point that the original exit 18 toll plaza located in Ridgefield was demolished. The new exit 18, which had more collection lanes than the original and was located in Secaucus, began charging tolls on February 25, 1964, concurrent with opening of the new exit 16 toll plaza. Another improvement made was the introduction of automatic ticket dispensers with the new exit 18 and exit 16, these were also later installed at exit 14, 14A, and 14C, as well as the exit 6 toll barrier. On May 29, the entrance ramps from Route 3 were opened, completing the two-year long project.

In 1965, construction began on a entirely new interchange with the under-construction Route 32 between exits 8 and 7. On February 14, 1966, this interchange, numbered as exit 8A was opened to traffic, though only partially; the connection to Route 32 westbound opened on November 5 at noon.

In November 1966, NJTA announced plans to widen the turnpike between exits 10 and 14 from eight to twelve lanes. This abolished the express-local roadway system and established a new system, with the outer roadway for all vehicles and inner roadway for cars only. Other aspects of the plan included constructing a new exit 10 in Edison Township, closeting the old exits 10 and rebuilding exits 11 to provide access to the Garden State parkway in Woodbridge, reverseing the trumpet at exit 12 in Carteret, and relocating exit 13 in Elizebeth to provide direct access to the Goethals Bridge and I-278 instead of Trenton Road. On July 27, 1968, it was announced that the replacement exit 13 would open on July 31. The interchange was opened as planned, and the old exit, which was a split interchange with Trenton Avenue, was closed permanently and slated for reverse engineering, this was completed by October. The new exit 11 was completed on September 18, 1969, at which point the original exit 10 was closed. The new exit 10 was opened on January 13, 1970, with new dual-dual setup opened the next day on January 14. The Western spur, a new extension of the turnpike meant to let through traffic bypass Secaucus, was opened on September 3, 1970. With this, multiple changes were made to the existing roadway. It was officially named the Eastern Spur, new unnumbered interchanges connecting it with the Western Spur were built, as well as a major renumbering to make it consistent with the new spur scheme, exit 15 was renumber exit 15E, exit 16 as exit 16E, and exit 18 as exit 18E. They also built exit 15W&#x27;s connection with the original road, and rebuilt exit 15E to provide access to Western Spur traffic. With the Bergen-Passaic Expressway being built on the north side of Ridgefild park in 1964, this left a mile long gap between the turnpike and expressway approaches onto the George Washington Bridge. This gap was closed on October 20, 1971, when an expanded interchange with US 46 was opened, which connected to the Bergen-Passaic expressway and replaced the trumpet interchange that only served US 46.
The New Jersey Turnpike smog accident occurred in the town of Kearny, on October 23 and 24, 1973. The first collision occurred at 11:20 p.m. EDT on the 23rd. Further accidents continued to occur until 2:45 a.m. the next day as cars plowed into the unseen accident ahead of them. Sixty-six vehicles were involved, and nine people died as a result. Thirty-nine suffered non-fatal injuries. The primary cause of the accident was related to a fire consisting of burning garbage, aggravated by foggy conditions. This produced an area of extremely poor visibility.

In 1971, the authority announced plans to extend the dual-dual setup from exit 10 in Woodbridge to exit 9 in East Brunswick. This project was completed northbound on November 14, 1973, and southbound on January 13, 1974, and involved a major reconstruction of exit 9, replacing the underpass with a overpass and building a wider toll plaza to replace the existing one. 

On May 30, 1974, exit 7A was opened to traffic. The interchange, which had been planned for since 1973, connected to I-195, was in part constructed to serve the nearby Great Adventure, which opened later that year. Additionally, in June, a widening of exit 15E&#x27;s toll plaza was completed, with an expansion of exit 14A&#x27;s following in August.

With the completion of I-78 to the Newark Bay Extension on May 27, 1977, the interchanges toll plaza was replaced with a wider one and ramps replaced, with none of the original 1951 configuration remaining.

In 1971, the NJTA proposed building the Alfred E. Driscoll Expressway. It was to start at the Garden State Parkway south of exit 80 in Dover Township (now Toms River) and end at the turnpike approximately north of exit 8A in South Brunswick. As a proposed part of the turnpike system, its seven interchanges would have included toll plazas except at the northern end of the turnpike. By 1972, the proposed road met fierce opposition from Ocean, Monmouth, and Middlesex counties with quality of life being the main concern. The NJTA proceeded anyway and began selling bonds. But by December 1973, Governor-elect Brendan Byrne decided to stop the project altogether. Despite this, the authority continued with its plan. It was not until February 1977 that the authority abandoned its plan to build the road. The rights-of-way were sold in 1979, shelving the project indefinitely.

In 1973, the NJTA began planning for exit 13A. The interchange would be constructed in order to provide direct connections to the nearby Newark Liberty International Airport, which had previously having required taking convoluted routes via exit 13 or 14. On June 10, 1982,this exit was opened to traffic.

In the 1987, the authority announced a plan a to rebuild the Western Spur. If this were ever to be completed, it would have added truck lanes, In addition, a new exit 15 W-A would be constructed, which would have served a extension of New Jersey Route 17, and exit 16W would have its ramps connecting to the turnpike be entirely replaced by a new ramp containing a wider toll plaza. However, this project was never carried out, in part due to the cancelation of the New Jersey Route 17 Extension.

===1990s to present===
In July 1988, a project to reconstruct exit 7 in order to accommodate an increasing number of truck traffic was announced. As part of this, a new 12 lane toll plaza and trumpet interchange located away from the original ramps were to be constructed, and the existing toll plaza was demolished, though the old overpass would be left intact as a U-turn ramp. Construction began almost immediately, and was completed in 1990, costing $30 million.

In 1985, the authority announced plans to extend the dual dual roadway to exit 8A in Monroe Township. However, this created some problems in the East Brunswick area. Analysis of noise and air quality impacts were made in a lawsuit decided in New Jersey Superior Court. This case, in the early 1970s, was one of the early examples of environmental scientists playing a role in the design of a major highway in the US. The computer models allowed the court to understand the effects of roadway geometry, in this case width, vehicle speeds, proposed noise barriers, residential setback and pavement types. The outcome was a compromise that involved substantial mitigation of noise pollution and air pollution impacts. Groundbreaking for this project began on June 23, 1987. Construction of the dual-dual roadway setup was completed on October 22, 1990, the rebuling of Exit 8A from a trumpet into T-intersection to a dual trumpet interchange was completed in May 1991.

In January 1992, the turnpike was extended by from I-95 exits 68 to 72B, NJDOT had sold this segment of roadway to balance the state budget.

In 1996, an HOV lane was opened between exits 11 and exits 14 on the truck lanes. The cost of this project was $361 million. It is reserved for use only during peak hours. By 1997, various improvements had also been made to the stretch between exits 14 and exits 15E in Newark. This part of the project cost $148 million. On September 24 of that year, the Pennsylvania connector was officially renamed the Pearl Harbor Memorial extension, this was done in remembrance of the Americans who died during the Attack on Pearl Harbor.

In May 1998, the speed limit was increased from between exits 1 and exits 13. Despite this, no other segment north of it had its speed limit raised.

In the late 1990s, a project to improve exit 13A in Elizabeth was started. It was completed in 1999, at the cost of $140 million. It was funded by the developers of Jersey Gardens, its construction was why the upgrade was carried out. Later that year, a bill to rename the mainline road as the &quot;&#x27;New Jersey Veterans Turnpike&quot; was proposed by the New Jersey General Assembly. Proposed by Jack Collins, this memorial would have resulted in $500,000 worth of signage replacement. Despite passing the assembly, it was never signed into law.
In October 1997, groundbreaking was held on a project to reconstruct the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension. As part of this project, a new interchange with US 130 was built that was completed on December 17, 1999, replacing the old slip ramp in the area that fead onto local streets with many potholes. in addition, the toll plaza was replaced with a new wider one that contained EZ-Pass lanes, this part of the project was completed in February 2000. On September 30 of that year, NJTA began using E-ZPass for electronic toll collection on the mainline.

A replacement exit 1 toll barrier was completed in July 2004. Planned since the 1990s, the new plaza features 23 lanes, a walkway to allow for the toll collectors to avoid crossing traffic, and four high-speed E-ZPass lanes (two in each direction). Construction of the plaza had started in early 2001, and had cost $44 million to construct. The plaza was located approximately north of the original toll gate.

In 2003, the E-ZPass system was extensively overhauled when the turnpike&#x27;s E-ZPass transitioned to ACS State and local solutions. Also in 2002, the authority proposed adding express lanes to the eastern and western spurs. In January 2004, the authority opened the new 18W express gantries in Carlstadt; these allowed for two lanes in each direction, though were restricted to EZ-Pass users only.

On December 1, 2005, the authority opened exit 15X. They did this to allow turnpike traffic to easily access the Secaucus Junction.

In order to address chronic congestion, the authority opened a new two lane ramp at exit 8A to carry traffic onto the newly extended CR 535 in February 2006. The ramp that allowed traffic onto Route 32 westbound was then closed off permanently (though not demolished); despite redundancy, the eastbound ramp was left intact. In May 2006, hybrid vehicles were permitted to use the HOV lanes during peak periods. The authority planned to build Route 92, an east–west spur from US 1 and Ridge Road in the township of South Brunswick to the mainline of the turnpike at exit 8A in Monroe Township. This proposition was canceled on December 1, 2006. The year also saw the completion of a project to expand exits 16E and 18E. 
In 2005, The authority began to lower the Eastern Spur (between mileposts 107.3 and 107.5) in Newark. This project, completed in 2008, made it so that the spur consisted of a minimum vertical clearance and horizontal clearance on the shoulders underneath the Pulaski Skyway (US 1/9).

In March 2010, The authority completed a project that rebuilt exit 16W in East Rutherford. Several new ramps were built, and old ones were demolished. One major modification was demolishing the old ramp from the tollgate to Route 3 west and constructing a new elevated ramp that swings swing around in the opposite direction to merge with Route 3 west, thereby completing the double trumpet-like interchange and reducing weaving on Route 3. In April, the NJTA completed a project that rebuilt exit 12 in the Borough of Carteret. The project, carried out in order to reduce truck traffic, involved constructing new elevated ramps from Roosevelt Avenue east to the toll gate, replacing what was previously a fully an at-grade interchange with a unidirectional one. In addition, the seven-lane toll booth was demolished, and a new 17-lane one was constructed in its place. While it initially planned to be completed in November or December 2009, though was delayed five to six months behind schedule.

The NJTA began accepting E-ZPass on all toll lanes on March 5, 2011, previously only marked lanes allowed for such. In the middle of that year, the authority also reconstructed the Route 495 westbound overpass across the turnpike at exit 16E in Secaucus in order to add a third lane to said ramp.

In late 2012, the authority completed a project that made many Safety improvements to exit 2 in Woolwich Township. A traffic signal at the T-intersection with US 322, and turn lanes were added, in addition, a fourth access point was also constructed.

In November 2004, Governor Richard Codey advocated a plan to widen the turnpike by extending the dual-dual configuration south from exit 8A in Monroe Township to exit 6 in Mansfield Township. This was to be completed by 2014 when Pennsylvania was supposed to finish an interchange, that would connect its turnpike to the existing I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania. Finances were to be supplied by rerouting money from the planned Route 92 Turnpike extension. On January 1, 2007, the NJTA released its plan for exit 8 in East Windsor Township. The old interchange, located west of the turnpike, would be demolished and replaced with a new one located to the east of the turnpike. Other interchanges were also to be upgraded with this widening project. exit 6 in Mansfield Township would have its dual two laned ramps replaced by multiple pairs of single lane ramps, exit 7 in Bordentown Township would have new depressed ramps added, exit 7A in Robbinsville Township would have three extra collection lanes added to its gate, and exit 8A in Monroe Township would have a new ramp added. The NJTA would also add a third truck lane between exit 9 in East Brunswick Township and exit 8A in Monroe Township. No overpass replacement was needed since overpasses were already designed with future expansion in mind. Only final preparation and paving of an outer lane in the outer roadways were required to accommodate the extra lane. New signage and lighting was installed as part of the widening project. It was thought that some transmission towers that ran near the turnpike would have to be replaced to make room for the newly constructed roadways. However, this idea was dismissed because it would have been cost prohibitive, and the towers, in fact, did not need to be. The widened turnpike features six lanes in each direction (3-3-3-3), double the previous capacity. The new exit 8 opened in January 2013, featuring a new toll plaza consisting of 10 lanes, with direct access to Route 133 (Hightstown Bypass) without going through any traffic lights, as well as to Route 33 by using a grade-separated interchange.Construction of a realigned Milford Road, near the interchange, was open to traffic in October 2011. Milford Road was converted into an overpass crossing over the new interchange 8 ramp. The junction with the realigned Milford Road, Route 33 and Monmouth Street was also modified. On July 2, 2009, a ceremonial groundbreaking took place near exit 8 to initiate the widening of the turnpike. On January 28, 2014, the last two of the project&#x27;s 31 construction contracts was awarded. On May 17–18, 2014, the NJTA switched traffic from the inner roadway for the new outer roadway to do repairs and resurfacing of the inner roadway. The rehabilitated northbound lanes opened on October 26, 2014, while the southbound lanes opened a week later on November 3, 2014. The final cost reported to be $2.3 billion. The project employed 1,000 workers a day, and at one point was the largest active road construction project in the Western Hemisphere.

All of the turnpike&#x27;s original variable-message signs (VMS) were replaced from 2010 to 2015, and many new signs were also added. The replacement signs, which feature full graphic color matrix technology, are more up-to-date and feature travel times to major routes when not otherwise in use.

In late October 2015, the southbound inner roadway exit ramp at exit 7A was closed to make repairs to the overpass crossing over the truck lanes. Steel plates beneath the deck of the exit ramp overpass &quot;were not built to specification&quot; when it was originally constructed, and to avoid premature replacement in the future, the ramps were repaired. These repairs were completed in late November 2015.

To reduce congestion, the NJTA has widened Route 18 and reconstructed all the associated ramps at exit 9 (except the ramp to Route 18 north) in East Brunswick Township. Construction began in late 2012 and was completed in mid-2016.

The authority planned to reconstruct exit 14A in Jersey City and its connectors in Bayonne because the interchange was in &quot;poor condition&quot; and suffered from chronic congestion. This was part of a bigger project to address future traffic volume along Route 440. Official groundbreaking occurred on March 11, 2015, with an expanded toll plaza and connector bridge targeted for completion in late 2018 with a $310 million budget. The newly expanded exit 14A reopened in May 2018 ahead of its anticipated opening later in the year.

Signage for I-95 was extended from I-195 in Robbinsville Township to exit 6 in September 2018, the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension was also signed.

In conjunction with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey&#x27;s replacement of the Goethals Bridge, improvements were being studied at exit 13 in Elizabeth and Linden. However, the interchange was ultimately left as is, with no improvements being made.

On March 24, 2020, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority temporarily suspended cash toll collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Drivers without E-ZPass transponders had their license plates photographed at the toll plazas and were sent bills in the mail. Cash collection resumed on May 19 of that year.

In January 2020, the NJTA announced plans to construct E-ZPass express lanes at exit 18E. This project was completed in November 2021. Additionally, they also widened the express lanes at exit 6 in order to add a single collection lane in each direction, as the original configuration had become obsolete.

From late April to May 2022, the ramps onto US 206 at exit 7 to the turnpike were temporarily closed so the overpass could be demolished. 

On June 9, 2023, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved redesignating the Eastern Spur as I-695 and officially designating the Western Spur as I-95.

==Future projects==
===Tremley Point Road Connector===
The authority is planning a roadway called the &quot;Tremley Point Road Connector&quot; from Industrial Highway in the Borough of Carteret to Tremley Point Road in the City of Linden. The purpose of this extension is to increase truck access to the Tremley Point industrial area in Linden while moving trucks off local streets in residential neighborhoods. The authority chose this access road rather than a full interchange with Tremley Point Road from the turnpike mainline because of its proximity to both exits 12 and 13. The estimated completion date of the connector has yet to be determined, but as of October 2019, a construction contract has been awarded.

===Exits 1 to 4 widening===
The NJTA plans to widen the segment of roadway between exits 1 through 4 to six lanes, thus eliminating the final four lane stretch of mainline roadway. Construction is planned to begin in 2025 and be completed in 2032. The widening, which has been in the planning stage since 1992, will also involve the replacement or rehabilitation of 55 overpasses, as well as improvements to exits 1 through 4. In addition to this, residents, and congressmen, are lobbying for the authority and NJDOT to construct a long-anticipated interchange between the turnpike with Route 42. This interchange would relieve tractor trailer traffic on exit 3 (Route 168), which creates massive backups as it is the only exit to Camden, Philadelphia, and southward. This proposed interchange will finally have a direct connection to the Atlantic City Expressway, I-76, and I-676. It would remove the requirement to travel through long suburban avenues with many traffic signals.

===Other plans===
The NJTA plans to widen the Newark Bay Extension from four to six lanes. This would involve replacing 29 bridge structures, including the Newark Bay Bridge, as they are in poor condition, functionally obsolete, and not designed to be widened. Construction on the first phase of the project is expected to begin in 2026 and to be completed sometime between 2032 and 2034, with the other 3 phases currently undetermined. There are also plans to widen the Western Spur from four lanes to six lanes, which would involve replacing many bridges, including the Harry Laderman Bridge. Long term plans call to convert the road to an all electronic tolling system, where E-ZPass is supported and those who do not have it get a picture of their license plate taken and charged a bill later. This would require demolishing conventional toll plazas in the process. There are also plans to extend the HOV lane past exit 13, as well as to replace a overpass carrying traffic at exit 17, as it has deteriorated significantly. Additionally, there are plans to replace the four lane wide Delaware River Bridge on the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension with new twin three lane twined cable-stayed bridges, with construction on this expected to begin sometime after 2030.

==Tolls==
The New Jersey Turnpike is a closed-system toll road, using a system of long-distance tickets, obtained once by the motorist upon entering and surrendered upon exiting at toll gates. The toll fee depends on the distance traveled—longer distances result in higher tolls. , the automobile toll from exit 1 to exit 18 is $20.05 using cash and $20.01 using E-ZPass electronic toll collection. If the ticket is lost, the driver must pay the highest toll fee upon exiting. In September 2000, the turnpike introduced E-ZPass electronic toll collection. Discounts were available to all users of the E-ZPass system until 2002. The cost to implement the E-ZPass system forced the NJTA to eliminate the discounts during peak hours and instead impose a $1 per month E-ZPass fee to account holders. E-ZPass customers with NJ accounts still receive a discount during off-peak hours, when the automobile toll from exit 1 to exit 18 is $14.15. Cash customers do not receive this discount. Four toll plazas on the turnpike have Express E-ZPass lanes, allowing E-ZPass customers to travel through toll areas at highway speeds, thanks to the addition of E-ZPass sensors on an overhead gantry. These high-speed toll gates are located at the northern terminus of the road on both the Western Spur and the Eastern Spur, the southern terminus in Carneys Point Township, and on the Pennsylvania Turnpike Extension. At each location, traditional E-ZPass and cash lanes are also available. Every toll lane on the turnpike accepts E-ZPass.

The non-tolled I-295, which parallels the turnpike for much of its southern length, is often used as an alternate route for shunpiking by locals and through travelers alike; before the replacement of the exit 1 toll plaza, this route was promoted through signage and radio announcements from the New Jersey State Police as a bypass of summer congestion at the plaza.

On March 24, 2020, the NJTA temporarily suspended cash toll collection because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drivers without E-ZPass transponders had their license plates photographed at the toll plazas and were sent bills in the mail. Cash collection resumed on May 19 of that year.

The turnpike and the Garden State Parkway raised tolls in 2020 and 2021 and, in its 2023 budget, called for another toll increase of 7.4% in 2023. The NJTA said the increase was due to &quot;pressures on discretionary travel and costs due to an inflation rate of 8.3%&quot;.

<text>The MIT Lincoln Laboratory TX-2 computer was the successor to the Lincoln TX-0 and was known for its role in advancing both artificial intelligence and human–computer interaction. Wesley A. Clark was the chief architect of the TX-2.

== Specifications ==
The TX-2 was a transistor-based computer using the then-huge amount of 64K 36-bit words of magnetic-core memory. The TX-2 became operational in 1958. Because of its powerful capabilities, Ivan Sutherland&#x27;s revolutionary Sketchpad program was developed for and ran on the TX-2. One of its key features was the ability to directly interact with the computer through a graphical display.

The compiler was developed by Lawrence Roberts while he was studying at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

== Relationship with DEC ==
Digital Equipment Corporation was a spin-off of the TX-0 and TX-2 projects. The TX-2 Tape System was a block addressable 1/2&quot; tape developed for the TX-2 by Tom Stockebrand which evolved into LINCtape and DECtape.

== Role in creating the Internet ==
Dr. Leonard Kleinrock developed the mathematical theory of packet networks which he successfully simulated on the TX-2 computer at Lincoln Lab.

<doc id="78130" wikidata="Q608294" url="?curid=78130" title="Max-flow min-cut theorem">
<text>In computer science and optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount of flow passing from the &quot;source&quot; to the &quot;sink&quot; is equal to the total weight of the edges in a minimum cut, i.e., the smallest total weight of the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink.

For example, imagine a network of pipes carrying water from a reservoir (the source) to a city (the sink). Each pipe has a capacity representing the maximum amount of water that can flow through it per unit of time. The max-flow min-cut theorem tells us that the maximum amount of water that can reach the city is limited by the smallest total capacity of any set of pipes that, if cut, would completely isolate the reservoir from the city. This smallest total capacity is the min-cut. So, if there&#x27;s a bottleneck in the pipe network, represented by a small min-cut, that bottleneck will determine the overall maximum flow of water to the city.

This is a special case of the duality theorem for linear programs and can be used to derive Menger&#x27;s theorem and the Kőnig–Egerváry theorem.

==Definitions and statement==

The theorem equates two quantities: the maximum flow through a network, and the minimum capacity of a cut of the network. To state the theorem, each of these notions must first be defined. 

===Network===

A network consists of 
* a finite directed graph , where &quot;V&quot; denotes the finite set of vertices and is the set of directed edges;
* a source and a sink ;
* a capacity function, which is a mapping formula_1 denoted by or for . It represents the maximum amount of flow that can pass through an edge.

=== Flows ===
A flow through a network is a mapping formula_2 denoted by formula_3 or formula_4, subject to the following two constraints:
# Capacity Constraint: For every edge formula_5, formula_6
# Conservation of Flows: For each vertex formula_7 apart from formula_8 and formula_9 (i.e. the source and sink, respectively), the following equality holds:formula_10

A flow can be visualized as a physical flow of a fluid through the network, following the direction of each edge. The capacity constraint then says that the volume flowing through each edge per unit time is less than or equal to the maximum capacity of the edge, and the conservation constraint says that the amount that flows into each vertex equals the amount flowing out of each vertex, apart from the source and sink vertices. 

The value of a flow is defined by 

:formula_11 

where as above formula_8 is the source and formula_9 is the sink of the network. In the fluid analogy, it represents the amount of fluid entering the network at the source. Because of the conservation axiom for flows, this is the same as the amount of flow leaving the network at the sink. 

The maximum flow problem asks for the largest flow on a given network. 

Maximum Flow Problem. Maximize formula_14, that is, to route as much flow as possible from formula_8 to formula_9.
=== Cuts ===
The other half of the max-flow min-cut theorem refers to a different aspect of a network: the collection of cuts. An s-t cut is a partition of such that and . That is, an &quot;s&quot;-&quot;t&quot; cut is a division of the vertices of the network into two parts, with the source in one part and the sink in the other. The cut-set formula_17 of a cut is the set of edges that connect the source part of the cut to the sink part:

:formula_18

Thus, if all the edges in the cut-set of are removed, then no positive flow is possible, because there is no path in the resulting graph from the source to the sink. 

The capacity of an &quot;s-t cut&quot; is the sum of the capacities of the edges in its cut-set,
:formula_19

where formula_20 if formula_21 and formula_22, formula_23 otherwise.

There are typically many cuts in a graph, but cuts with smaller weights are often more difficult to find. 

:Minimum s-t Cut Problem. Minimize , that is, determine and such that the capacity of the s-t cut is minimal.

=== Main theorem ===
In the above situation, one can prove that the value of any flow through a network is less than or equal to the capacity of any &quot;s-t&quot; cut, and that furthermore a flow with maximal value and a cut with minimal capacity exist. The main theorem links the maximum flow value with the minimum cut capacity of the network.

: Max-flow min-cut theorem. The maximum value of an s-t flow is equal to the minimum capacity over all s-t cuts.

==Example==

The figure on the right shows a flow in a network. The numerical annotation on each arrow, in the form &quot;f&quot;/&quot;c&quot;, indicates the flow (&quot;f&quot;) and the capacity (&quot;c&quot;) of the arrow. The flows emanating from the source total five (2+3=5), as do the flows into the sink (2+3=5), establishing that the flow&#x27;s value is 5. 

One &quot;s&quot;-&quot;t&quot; cut with value 5 is given by &quot;S&quot;={&quot;s&quot;,&quot;p&quot;} and &quot;T&quot;={&quot;o&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;}. The capacities of the edges that cross this cut are 3 and 2, giving a cut capacity of 3+2=5. (The arrow from &quot;o&quot; to &quot;p&quot; is not considered, as it points from &quot;T&quot; back to &quot;S&quot;.) 

The value of the flow is equal to the capacity of the cut, showing that the flow is a maximal flow and the cut is a minimal cut.

Note that the flow through each of the two arrows that connect &quot;S&quot; to &quot;T&quot; is at full capacity; this is always the case: a minimal cut represents a &#x27;bottleneck&#x27; of the system.

==Linear program formulation==
The max-flow problem and min-cut problem can be formulated as two primal-dual linear programs.

The max-flow LP is straightforward. The dual LP is obtained using the algorithm described in dual linear program: the variables and sign constraints of the dual correspond to the constraints of the primal, and the constraints of the dual correspond to the variables and sign constraints of the primal. The resulting LP requires some explanation. The interpretation of the variables in the min-cut LP is:

:formula_24 

:formula_25

The minimization objective sums the capacity over all the edges that are contained in the cut.

The constraints guarantee that the variables indeed represent a legal cut:

* The constraints formula_26 (equivalent to formula_27) guarantee that, for non-terminal nodes &quot;u,v&quot;, if &quot;u&quot; is in &quot;S&quot; and &quot;v&quot; is in &quot;T&quot;, then the edge (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) is counted in the cut (formula_28).
* The constraints formula_29 (equivalent to formula_30) guarantee that, if &quot;v&quot; is in &quot;T&quot;, then the edge &quot;(s,v)&quot; is counted in the cut (since &quot;s&quot; is by definition in &quot;S&quot;).
* The constraints formula_31 (equivalent to formula_32) guarantee that, if &quot;u&quot; is in &quot;S&quot;, then the edge &quot;(u,t)&quot; is counted in the cut (since &quot;t&quot; is by definition in &quot;T&quot;).

Note that, since this is a minimization problem, we do not have to guarantee that an edge is &quot;not&quot; in the cut - we only have to guarantee that each edge that should be in the cut, is summed in the objective function.

The equality in the max-flow min-cut theorem follows from the strong duality theorem in linear programming, which states that if the primal program has an optimal solution, &quot;x&quot;*, then the dual program also has an optimal solution, &quot;y&quot;*, such that the optimal values formed by the two solutions are equal.

==Application==

===Cederbaum&#x27;s maximum flow theorem===

The maximum flow problem can be formulated as the maximization of the electrical current through a network composed of nonlinear resistive elements. In this formulation, the limit of the current between the input terminals of the electrical network as the input voltage approaches formula_33, is equal to the weight of the minimum-weight cut set. 

:formula_34

===Generalized max-flow min-cut theorem===
In addition to edge capacity, consider there is capacity at each vertex, that is, a mapping formula_35 denoted by , such that the flow has to satisfy not only the capacity constraint and the conservation of flows, but also the vertex capacity constraint

:formula_36

In other words, the amount of &quot;flow&quot; passing through a vertex cannot exceed its capacity. Define an &quot;s-t cut&quot; to be the set of vertices and edges such that for any path from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;t&quot;, the path contains a member of the cut. In this case, the &quot;capacity of the cut&quot; is the sum of the capacity of each edge and vertex in it.

In this new definition, the generalized max-flow min-cut theorem states that the maximum value of an s-t flow is equal to the minimum capacity of an s-t cut in the new sense.

===Menger&#x27;s theorem===

In the undirected edge-disjoint paths problem, we are given an undirected graph and two vertices and , and we have to find the maximum number of edge-disjoint s-t paths in .

Menger&#x27;s theorem states that the maximum number of edge-disjoint s-t paths in an undirected graph is equal to the minimum number of edges in an s-t cut-set.

===Project selection problem===

In the project selection problem, there are projects and machines. Each project yields revenue and each machine costs to purchase. We want to select a subset of the project, and purchase a subset of the machines, to maximize the total profit (revenue of the selected projects minus cost of the purchased machines). We must obey the following constraint: each project specifies a set of machines which must be purchased if the project is selected. (Each machine, once purchased, can be used by any selected project.)

To solve the problem, let be the set of projects &quot;not&quot; selected and be the set of machines purchased, then the problem can be formulated as,

:formula_37

Since the first term does not depend on the choice of and , this maximization problem can be formulated as a minimization problem instead, that is,

:formula_38

The above minimization problem can then be formulated as a minimum-cut problem by constructing a network, where the source is connected to the projects with capacity , and the sink is connected by the machines with capacity . An edge with &quot;infinite&quot; capacity is added if project requires machine . The s-t cut-set represents the projects and machines in and respectively. By the max-flow min-cut theorem, one can solve the problem as a maximum flow problem.

The figure on the right gives a network formulation of the following project selection problem:

The minimum capacity of an s-t cut is 250 and the sum of the revenue of each project is 450; therefore the maximum profit &quot;g&quot; is 450 − 250 = 200, by selecting projects and .

The idea here is to &#x27;flow&#x27; each project&#x27;s profits through the &#x27;pipes&#x27; of its machines. If we cannot fill the pipe from a machine, the machine&#x27;s return is less than its cost, and the min cut algorithm will find it cheaper to cut the project&#x27;s profit edge instead of the machine&#x27;s cost edge.

===Image segmentation problem===
In the image segmentation problem, there are pixels. Each pixel can be assigned a foreground value or a background value . There is a penalty of if pixels are adjacent and have different assignments. The problem is to assign pixels to foreground or background such that the sum of their values minus the penalties is maximum.

Let be the set of pixels assigned to foreground and be the set of points assigned to background, then the problem can be formulated as,

: formula_39

This maximization problem can be formulated as a minimization problem instead, that is,

: formula_40

The above minimization problem can be formulated as a minimum-cut problem by constructing a network where the source (orange node) is connected to all the pixels with capacity , and the sink (purple node) is connected by all the pixels with capacity . Two edges () and () with capacity are added between two adjacent pixels. The s-t cut-set then represents the pixels assigned to the foreground in and pixels assigned to background in .

==History==
An account of the discovery of the theorem was given by Ford and Fulkerson in 1962:

&quot;Determining a maximal steady state flow from one point to another in a network subject to capacity limitations on arcs ... was posed to the authors in the spring of 1955 by T.E. Harris, who, in conjunction with General F. S. Ross (Ret.) had formulated a simplified model of railway traffic flow, and pinpointed this particular problem as the central one suggested by the model. It was not long after this until the main result, Theorem 5.1, which we call the max-flow min-cut theorem, was conjectured and established. A number of proofs have since appeared.&quot;

==Proof==
Let be a network (directed graph) with and being the source and the sink of respectively.

Consider the flow computed for by Ford–Fulkerson algorithm. In the residual graph obtained for (after the final flow assignment by Ford–Fulkerson algorithm), define two subsets of vertices as follows:
# : the set of vertices reachable from in 
# : the set of remaining vertices i.e. 

Claim. , where the capacity of an &quot;s-t cut&quot; is defined by 
:formula_41.

Now, we know, formula_42 for any subset of vertices, . Therefore, for we need:
* All &quot;outgoing edges&quot; from the cut must be fully saturated.
* All &quot;incoming edges&quot; to the cut must have zero flow.

To prove the above claim we consider two cases:

*In , there exists an &quot;outgoing edge&quot; formula_43 such that it is not saturated, i.e., . This implies, that there exists a forward edge from to in , therefore there exists a path from to in , which is a contradiction. Hence, any outgoing edge is fully saturated.

*In , there exists an &quot;incoming edge&quot; formula_44 such that it carries some non-zero flow, i.e., . This implies, that there exists a backward edge from to in , therefore there exists a path from to in , which is again a contradiction. Hence, any incoming edge must have zero flow.

Both of the above statements prove that the capacity of cut obtained in the above described manner is equal to the flow obtained in the network. Also, the flow was obtained by Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, so it is the max-flow of the network as well.

Also, since any flow in the network is always less than or equal to capacity of every cut possible in a network, the above described cut is also the min-cut which obtains the max-flow.

A corollary from this proof is that the maximum flow through any set of edges in a cut of a graph is equal to the minimum capacity of all previous cuts.

<doc id="78135" wikidata="Q215548" url="?curid=78135" title="Jester">
<text>A jester, also known as joker, court jester, or fool, was a member of the household of a nobleman or a monarch kept to entertain guests at the royal court. Jesters were also travelling performers who entertained common folk at fairs and town markets, and the discipline continues into the modern day, where jesters perform at historical-themed events. Jester-like figures were common throughout the world, including Ancient Rome, China, Persia, and the Aztec empire.

During the post-classical and Renaissance eras, jesters are often thought to have worn brightly coloured clothes and eccentric hats in a motley pattern. Their modern counterparts usually mimic this costume.

Jesters entertained with a wide variety of skills: principal among them were song, music, and storytelling, but many also employed acrobatics, juggling, telling jokes (such as puns and imitation), and performing magic tricks. Much of the entertainment was performed in a comic style. Many jesters made contemporary jokes in word or song about people or events well known to their audiences.

==Etymology==
The modern use of the English word &quot;jester&quot; did not come into use until the mid-16th century, during Tudor times. This modern term derives from the older form &quot;gestour&quot;, or &quot;jestour&quot;, originally from French meaning &#x27;storyteller&#x27; or &#x27;minstrel&#x27;. Other earlier terms included &quot;fol&quot;, &quot;disour&quot;, &quot;buffoon&quot;, and &quot;bourder&quot;. These terms described entertainers who differed in their skills and performances but who all shared many similarities in their role as comedic performers for their audiences.

==History==

=== &quot;Balatrones&quot; ===
In ancient Rome, a ( ) was a professional jester or buffoon. were paid for their jests, and the tables of the wealthy were generally open to them for the sake of the amusement they afforded.

There are various theories about the origin of the term. In Horace, Balatro is used as a proper name: . An old scholiast derives the common word from the proper name, suggesting that buffoons were called because was a buffoon, though others have since objected to this account. Festus derives the word from , and supposes buffoons to have been called because they were dirty fellows, covered with spots of mud () from walking. Another writer suggests a derivation from , because they, so to speak, carried their jesting to market, even into the very depth () of the shambles () may be connected with , &quot;to bleat like a sheep&quot;, and hence, to speak sillily. Others have suggested a connection with , a busy-body.

Jester-like figures have been common throughout the world. They were known in China, Persia, and the Aztec empire.

===English royal court jesters===
Many royal courts throughout English royal history employed entertainers and most had professional fools, sometimes called &quot;licensed fools&quot;. Fool Societies, or groups of nomadic entertainers, were often hired to perform acrobatics and juggling.

Jesters were also occasionally used as psychological warfare. Jesters would ride in front of their troops, provoke or mock the enemy, and even serve as messengers. They played an important part in raising their own army&#x27;s spirits by singing songs and reciting stories.

Henry VIII of England employed a jester named Will Sommers. His daughter Mary was entertained by Jane Foole.

During the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I of England, William Shakespeare wrote his plays and performed with his theatre company the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men (later called the King&#x27;s Men). Clowns and jesters were featured in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and the company&#x27;s expert on jesting was Robert Armin, author of the book &quot;Foole upon Foole&quot;. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Feste the jester is described as &quot;wise enough to play the fool&quot;.

In Scotland, Mary, Queen of Scots, had a jester called Nichola. Her son, King James VI of Scotland, employed a jester called Archibald Armstrong. During his lifetime Armstrong was given great honours at court. He was eventually thrown out of the King&#x27;s employment when he over-reached and insulted too many influential people. Even after his disgrace, books telling of his jests were sold in London streets. He held some influence at court still in the reign of Charles I and estates of land in Ireland. Anne of Denmark had a Scottish jester called Tom Durie. Charles I later employed a jester called Jeffrey Hudson who was very popular and loyal. Jeffrey Hudson had the title of &quot;Royal Dwarf&quot; because he was short of stature. One of his jests was to be presented hidden in a giant pie from which he would leap out. Hudson fought on the Royalist side in the English Civil War. A third jester associated with Charles I was called Muckle John.

===Jester&#x27;s privilege===
Jester&#x27;s privilege is the ability and right of a jester to talk and mock freely without being punished. As an acknowledgement of this right, the court jester had symbols denoting their status and protection under the law. The crown (cap and bells) and sceptre (marotte) mirrored the royal crown and sceptre wielded by a monarch.

Martin Luther used jest in many of his criticisms against the Catholic Church. In the introduction to his &quot;To the Christian Nobility of the German Nation&quot;, he calls himself a court jester, and, later in the text, he explicitly invokes the jester&#x27;s privilege when saying that monks should break their chastity vows.

==Political significance==
Jesters could give bad news to the King that no one else would dare deliver. In 1340, when the French fleet was destroyed at the Battle of Sluys by the English, Phillippe VI&#x27;s jester told him the English sailors &quot;don&#x27;t even have the guts to jump into the water like our brave French&quot;.

===End of tradition===
After the Restoration, Charles II did not reinstate the tradition of the court jester, but he did greatly patronise the theatre and proto-music hall entertainments, especially favouring the work of Thomas Killigrew. Though Killigrew was not officially a jester, Samuel Pepys in his famous diary does call Killigrew &quot;The King&#x27;s fool and jester, with the power to mock and revile even the most prominent without penalty&quot; (12 February 1668).

In the 18th century, jesters had died out except in Russia, Spain, and Germany. In France and Italy, travelling groups of jesters performed plays featuring stylised characters in a form of theatre called the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;. A version of this passed into British folk tradition in the form of a puppet show, &quot;Punch and Judy&quot;. In France the tradition of the court jester ended with the abolition of the monarchy in the French Revolution.

In 2015, the town of Conwy in North Wales appointed Russel Erwood (aka Erwyd le Fol) as the official resident jester of the town and its people, a post that had been vacant since 1295.

===Other countries===

Poland&#x27;s most famous court jester was Stańczyk (&quot;c&quot;. 1480–1560), whose jokes were usually related to political matters, and who later became a historical symbol for Poles.

In 2004 English Heritage appointed Nigel Roder (&quot;Kester the Jester&quot;) as the State Jester for England, the first since Muckle John 355 years previously. However, following an objection by the National Guild of Jesters, English Heritage accepted they were not authorised to grant such a title. Roder was succeeded as &quot;Heritage Jester&quot; by Pete Cooper (&quot;Peterkin the Fool&quot;).

In Germany, Till Eulenspiegel is a folkloric hero dating back to medieval times and ruling each year over Fasching or Carnival time, mocking politicians and public figures of power and authority with political satire like a modern-day court jester. He holds a mirror to make us aware of our times (Zeitgeist), and his sceptre, his &quot;bauble&quot;, or marotte, is the symbol of his power.

In 17th century Spain, dwarves, often with deformities, were employed as buffoons to entertain the king and his family, especially the children. In Velázquez&#x27;s painting Las Meninas two dwarfs are included: Maria Bárbola, a female dwarf from Germany with hydrocephalus, and Nicolasito Portusato from Italy. Mari Bárbola can also be seen in a later portrait of princess Margarita Teresa in mourning by Juan Bautista Martinez del Mazo. There are other paintings by Velázquez that include court dwarves such as Prince Balthasar Charles With a Dwarf.

During the Renaissance Papacy, the Papal court in Rome had a court jester, similar to the secular courts of the time. Pope Pius V dismissed the court Jester, and no later Pope employed one.

In Japan from the 13th to 18th centuries, the &quot;taikomochi&quot;, a kind of male geisha, attended the feudal lords (&quot;daimyōs&quot;). They entertained mostly through dancing and storytelling, and were at times counted on for strategic advice. By the 16th century they fought alongside their lord in battle in addition to their other duties.

Tonga was the first royal court to appoint a court jester in the 20th century; Taufa&#x27;ahau Tupou IV, the King of Tonga, appointed JD Bogdanoff to that role in 1999. Bogdanoff was later embroiled in a financial scandal.

==As a symbol==
The root of the word &quot;fool&quot; is from the Latin &quot;follis&quot;, which means &quot;bag of wind&quot; or bellows or that which contains air or breath.

===In fiction===

The jester can be symbolic of common sense and of honesty, notably in &quot;King Lear&quot;, where the court jester is a character used for insight and advice on the part of the monarch, taking advantage of his licence to mock and speak freely to dispense frank observations and highlight the folly of his monarch. This presents a clashing irony as a greater man could dispense the same advice and find himself being detained in the dungeons or even executed. Only as the lowliest member of the court can the jester be the monarch&#x27;s most useful adviser.

The Shakespearean fool is a recurring character type in the works of William Shakespeare. Shakespearean fools are usually clever peasants or commoners that use their wits to outdo people of higher social standing. In this sense, they are very similar to the real fools, and jesters of the time, but their characteristics are greatly heightened for theatrical effect. The &quot;groundlings&quot; (theatre-goers who were too poor to pay for seats and thus stood on the &#x27;ground&#x27; in the front by the stage) that frequented the Globe Theatre were more likely to be drawn to these Shakespearean fools. However they were also favoured by the nobility. Most notably, Queen Elizabeth I was a great admirer of the popular actor who portrayed fools, Richard Tarlton. For Shakespeare himself, however, actor Robert Armin may have proved vital to the cultivation of the fool character in his many plays.

===In tarot===

In tarot, &quot;The Fool&quot; is a card of the Major Arcana. The tarot depiction of the Fool often shows a man (or less often, a woman) dressed in bright clothes and holding a white rose in one hand and a small bundle of possessions in the other, with a dog or cat at their heels. The fool is in the act of unknowingly walking off the edge of a cliff, precipice, or other high place.

==Modern usage==
===Buffoon===
In a similar vein, a buffoon is someone who provides amusement through inappropriate appearance or behaviour. Originally the term was used to describe a ridiculous but amusing person. The term is now frequently used in a derogatory sense to describe someone considered foolish, or someone displaying inappropriately vulgar, bumbling or ridiculous behaviour which is a source of general amusement. The term originates from the old Italian &quot;buffare&quot;, meaning to puff out one&#x27;s cheeks that also applies to bouffon. Having swelled their cheeks they would slap them to expel the air and produce a noise which amused the spectators.

===Carnival and medieval reenactment===
During the Burgundian and the Rhenish carnival, cabaret performances in local dialect are held. In Brabant this person is called a &quot;tonpraoter&quot; or &quot;sauwelaar&quot;, and is actually in or on a barrel. In Limburg they are named &quot;buuttereedner&quot; or &quot;buutteredner&quot; and in Zeeland they are called an &quot;ouwoer&quot;. They all perform a cabaret speech in dialect, during which many current issues are reviewed. Often there are local situations and celebrities from local and regional politics who are mocked, ridiculed and insulted. The &quot;Tonpraoter&quot; or &quot;Buuttereedner&quot; may be considered successors of the jesters.

<text>HyperTalk is a discontinued high-level, procedural programming language created in 1987 by Dan Winkler and used in conjunction with Apple Computer&#x27;s HyperCard hypermedia program by Bill Atkinson. Because the main target audience of HyperTalk was beginning programmers, HyperTalk programmers were usually called &quot;authors&quot; and the process of writing programs was known as &quot;scripting&quot;. HyperTalk scripts resembled written English and used a logical structure similar to that of the Pascal programming language.

HyperTalk supported the basic control structures of procedural languages: repeat for/while/until, if/then/else, as well as function and message &quot;handler&quot; calls (a function handler was a subroutine and a message handler a procedure). Data types usually did not need to be specified by the programmer; conversion happened transparently in the background between strings and numbers. There were no classes or data structures in the traditional sense; in their place were special string literals, or &quot;lists&quot; of &quot;items&quot; delimited by commas (in later versions the &quot;itemDelimiter&quot; property allowed choosing an arbitrary character). Code execution typically began as a response to an event such as a mouse click on a UI widget.

In the late 1980s, Apple considered using HyperCard&#x27;s HyperTalk scripting language as the standard language across the company and within its classic Mac OS operating system, as well as for interprocess communication between Apple and non-Apple products. The company did not oppose the development of imitations like SuperCard, but it created the HyperTalk Standards Committee to avoid incompatibility between language variants. The case-insensitive language was initially interpreted, but gained just-in-time compilation with HyperCard 2.0.

==Description==

===Fundamental operations===
For most basic operations including mathematical computations, HyperTalk favored natural-language ordering of predicates over the ordering used in mathematical notation. For example, in HyperTalk&#x27;s codice_1 assignment command, the variable was placed at the end of the statement:

 put 5 * 4 into theResult

whereas in the more traditional BASIC programming language (and most others), the same would be accomplished by writing:

 theResult = 5 * 4
The HyperTalk code has the side-effect of creating the variable &quot;theResult&quot; on the fly. Scripts could assign any type or value to a variable using the codice_1 command, making HyperTalk &quot;very&quot; weakly typed. Conversions between variable types were invisible and automatic: the string &quot;3&quot; could be multiplied by the number 5 to produce the number 15, or the number 5 concatenated onto the string &quot;3&quot; to produce the string &quot;35&quot;. HyperTalk would not complain unless the types could not be automatically converted.

The language&#x27;s flow control and logic were generally similar to other common languages, using an codice_3 structure for conditionals and supporting loops based on a flexible codice_4 syntax. Comments were prefaced with two minus signs: codice_5.

===Objects, containers and scripts===
HyperCard&#x27;s primary user interface concept was the &quot;card&quot;, a display system that emulated an index card. Cards were normally used to store information, similar to a record in a conventional flat-file database. The graphical layout of the card was created using the mouse by placing various elements on the card, such as text fields and buttons. A master layout &quot;card&quot; known as the &quot;background&quot; was shown behind the transparent areas of each card. Objects placed on the background, such as fields and buttons, would be shared as a common layout among several cards, but with card-specific content. The collection of cards, backgrounds and the associated data stored in them were stored in a single file known as the &quot;stack&quot; (of cards). Collectively, all of these data-containing objects are referred to as &quot;containers&quot;.

HyperTalk functions, or &quot;scripts&quot;, were normally stored within the codice_6 property available in many of the stack&#x27;s containers. Scripts could access the properties of a container, corresponding to instance variables, using the codice_7 and codice_8 instructions. The script property held plain text and had no special properties; scripts could be placed in, and run from, any text container, including string variables, or imported from other stacks using the codice_9 command. A script could even be user-provided text typed into an on-screen text field. Arbitrary text could be executed using the codice_10 command, in a manner similar to Dynamic SQL.

===Referring to containers===
A key concept in HyperTalk was the way it referred to containers through a navigational system based on the visual hierarchy of the stack. Every container in the stack was given a unique ID number when created and could also be given an optional name. Scripts could refer to objects by using either of these identifiers, along with an object &quot;type&quot; specified using the codice_11 operator. This operator used a natural language syntax making for easily readable, self-documenting code. For instance, a script stored in a button on a card might wish to take user-supplied text gathered using a text field and store the text in a variable called &quot;theValue&quot;:

 put the value of card field &quot;typehere&quot; into theValue

Various contextual aspects of statements could be inferred by the interpreter. In the statement above, for example, because the script would be running in the context of a button on a specific card, the identifier &quot;card&quot; was understood to refer to the card the user was interacting with, even though the button itself would normally be on the background. In addition, &quot;&quot;the value&quot; (the text submitted by the user) was assumed to be the main property and to be the target of operations if not otherwise specified. Likewise, &quot;card field&quot;&quot; was assumed to be the target of the command, as opposed to the background field, so that information could also be omitted. Even container types had short forms that programmers could use to save typing. Thus the code above is equivalent to the shorter form:

 put fld &quot;typehere&quot; into theValue
Objects within a given context—the card or background, for instance—were also given a runtime number based on their z-order on the screen. To assist in using their position for navigation, HyperTalk also included a variety of ordinal and cardinal referencing systems to simplify the syntax further. Assuming the field &quot;typehere&quot; is the only field on the card, the code above could also be written:

 put the first card field into theValue

or:

 put card field 1 into theValue

The choice of addressing style was left to the programmer; often different styles were used in different statements depending on the style of the surrounding code in order to make the code more readable.

HyperTalk included the codice_12 container which acted in the same fashion as the codice_13 qualifier found in most object-oriented languages, allowing simple access to the current container object. Less common was the codice_14 variable, which held the value of the last operation for certain built-in operators. For example:

 ask &quot;What is the value?&quot;
 put it into card field &quot;display&quot;

This example uses the codice_15 command to display a dialog box and capture the text typed into an accompanying text field; when the dialog is completed by hitting or clicking , the value is assigned to the codice_14 pseudo-variable. The second line then copies that value into a card field using the codice_1 assignment operator.

===Collections===
Containers of a given type were also available as collections with a pluralized version of that container type as its name—the collection of the fields on a card was codice_18. These collections were themselves containers with their own properties. Key among these was the codice_19 property which was widely used during iterations and similar tasks. For instance, if one wanted to hide all the fields on a card, this could be accomplished with this code:
 repeat with i = 1 to the number of card fields
 hide field i
 end repeat
This code exposes another common feature of HyperTalk: that a property might have several names and operators. In this case the codice_20 command, and the associated codice_21, act by setting the value of the container&#x27;s codice_22 property. Thus codice_23 is exactly equivalent to . A similar example was the codice_24 command that stopped visual updating, which was a short form for , where codice_25 is a property of HyperCard itself—also a container. Many examples of this sort of syntactic sugar were found in HyperTalk, in order to simplify the syntax and improve readability of common code.

In HyperCard 2.2 and later, the collection of collections was also available as a container&#x27;s codice_26. This allowed a script to address all of the objects in a container with a single iterator.

===Handling text===
A notable feature of the HyperTalk container model was its handling of text. Every collection of text, whether a literal string in a program or text typed into a text field, was itself considered a container with multiple collections of containers within it. This allowed scripts to parse text using the same navigational commands as any other container. For instance, while parsing a space-delimited data file, one might want to extract the third column, like this:

 put the third word of theFilesText into colThree

This syntax allowed the script to &quot;walk&quot; down the text to find particular data, as in this example:

 put the first character of the third word of line 5 of card field &quot;sometext&quot; into theChar

This process of treating text as a container was known as &quot;chunking&quot;, and the functions as &quot;chunk expressions&quot;. These same sorts of expressions were used to handle file manipulation, along with a set of file management functions. The following code opens a known file, reads from it, extracts data, and then closes the file:

 on mouseDown
 answer file &quot;Please select a text file to open.&quot;
 if it is empty then exit mouseDown
 put it into filePath
 if there is a file filePath then
 open file filePath
 read from file filePath until return
 put it into cd fld &quot;some field&quot;
 close file filePath
 set the textStyle of character 1 to 10 of card field &quot;some field&quot; to bold
 end if
 end mouseDown

HyperTalk also included functions for chunking strings using a substring-find operation using the codice_27 operator. The following code finds all examples of a given pattern using the codice_27 as part of the codice_29 loop, while codice_30 finds the location of that pattern within the string:

 function replaceStr pattern,newStr,inStr
 repeat while pattern is in inStr
 put offset(pattern,inStr) into pos
 put newStr into character pos to (pos +the length of pattern)-1 of inStr
 end repeat
 return inStr
 end replaceStr
===Lists and other collections===
HyperTalk used the same chunking system to produce structures like arrays or lists. Such a structure would be created by placing multiple data items in a variable, separated by commas. Various types of data could be imported into a HyperTalk script using strings that would get parsed as required. For instance, the position of objects on the screen was defined by a pair of numbers representing the X and Y coordinates relative to the upper left corner. The following code creates a variable called &quot;pos&quot; that holds a coordinate pair, and then manipulates this to re-position all of the buttons on a card in a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right:

 on mouseUp
 put &quot;100,100&quot; into pos
 repeat with x = 1 to the number of card buttons
 set the location of card button x to pos
 add 15 to item 1 of pos
 end repeat
 end mouseUp

The codice_31 chunking expression was originally based on a comma delimiter, but later versions of HyperCard changed this to the value of codice_32, offering the ability to parse arbitrary lists and structures.

===Messages and events===
HyperTalk used an object-oriented concept for calling scripts, with objects in the stack sending &quot;events&quot; as &quot;messages&quot; that would be processed by &quot;handlers&quot; that declared their interest in receiving the events using the codice_33 syntax. For instance, most GUI containers would send the codice_34 message when the mouse button was clicked down, and then a codice_35 message when it was released while still on top of that container, and a script could capture these events like this:

 on mouseUp
 -- place additional code here
 end mouseUp

Messages for events were first sent to the script in the object that created the event, for instance, if the user clicked on a button the codice_35 message was first sent to that button. If the button&#x27;s script object did not have a codice_35 handler (or no script at all), it was then passed to the card, the background, the stack, any stacks whose scripts had been explicitly imported using the codice_9 command, the &quot;home stack&quot; (a user-selected always-open HyperCard stack), and finally to the HyperCard application itself.

For many simple events like mouse clicks on buttons the script would be placed directly within the object in question, the button itself. For instance, one might use the example code above within a button handler in this fashion:

 on mouseUp
 repeat with i = 1 to the number of card fields
 hide field i
 end repeat
 end mouseUp

In the case where code was being called from multiple locations, or it was being used as a global handler for an event, the script could determine the original sender of the event using the codice_39 function. Likewise, scripts could send events to other containers using the codice_40 command and then using the navigational code to refer to the container holding that handler&#x27;s code:
 send &quot;mouseUp&quot; to card button &quot;OK&quot; of card &quot;Veracity&quot;

Combining HyperTalk&#x27;s string processing with the codice_10 command allowed for the construction of interactive interpreters by placing a text field on a card and then placing this code in the field&#x27;s script:

 on mouseUp 
 select the clickLine
 put word 2 of the clickLine into linenum
 do line linenum of cd fld 1
 end mouseUp

codice_42 is a global property that returns the name and line number of the last field clicked, in a form like . This code first selects all of the text on the clicked line, then extracts the line number into a local variable, then uses codice_10 to run the text as a HyperCard script.

The codice_34 message was sent to a button when the user clicked it, and codice_35 was sent when the user released the mouse inside it to trigger its action. Similarly, HyperCard sent periodic codice_46 message, codice_47, codice_48, ... and various other messages related to navigation between different cards in a HyperCard stack, as well as user input (codice_49, codice_50, ...), and system events. As far as the scripters were concerned, there were no main event loops like in other procedural programming languages.

===Controlling HyperCard===
Unlike general rapid application development platforms, HyperCard stacks always looked like stacks - the menu bar was HyperCard&#x27;s and not the programmer&#x27;s (by default—scripting could add, delete and modify menus), the single window was a fixed size (in early versions), and in certain cases, commands that were central to the operation were part of the application itself, and not directly available in HyperTalk itself.

A good example of this was the creation of new cards, which was part of the application, not directly accessible from the HyperTalk language itself. A new card could only be created using the New Card menu item, which could be simulated in code usingcodice_51. While HyperTalk called into menu commands, menu commands also invoked handlers in HyperTalk. To run custom code when the Copy menu item was selected, one would place a script in the stack using the codice_52 handler, and then examine codice_53 to see if it was &quot;Copy&quot;.

HyperTalk also provided script control over the built-in drawing tools, simply by scripting the needed changes in paint tools and simulating mouse movements using the codice_54 and the codice_55 commands.

===Forgiving semantics===
One unique distinction between HyperCard&#x27;s programming language HyperTalk and seemingly similar languages like AppleScript was that HyperTalk scripts were more lenient in what input they accepted.

Apart from the above implicit declaration of variables when a value was assigned to them, and the way values were implicitly converted between types (allowing you to e.g. ask for codice_56), HyperCard would also recognize certain expressions and extract sub-values from them.

For example:
put the selectedLine of card field &quot;Listbox&quot; into theSelection -- gives &#x27;line 2 to 3 of card field &quot;Listbox&quot;&#x27;
select line 1 of card field &quot;Listbox&quot;
select line (word 2 of theSelection) of card field &quot;Listbox&quot;
select (the selectedLine of card field &quot;Listbox&quot;) -- parentheses added for illustrative purposes only
or
play harpsichord c e g
play harpsichord &quot;c e g&quot;
put &quot;c e g&quot; into theMelody
play harpsichord theMelody
While the end result felt similar to scripters as a Bash script&#x27;s expansion of variables before parsing, this was special-case syntax and did not have the pitfalls where data would be evaluated as code. So for example, all of the following are syntax errors in the melody, not function calls:
play harpsichord &quot;c e g()&quot;
put &quot;c e() g&quot; into theMelody
play harpsichord theMelody
==Extending HyperTalk==
Although the HyperTalk language languished just like HyperCard itself, it interest was revived through its plugin protocol, so-called External Commands (XCMDs) and External Functions (XFCNs), which were native code containers attached to stacks (as Macintosh-specific resources) with a single entry point and return value. XCMDs and XFCNs could be called just like regular message and function handlers from HyperTalk scripts, and were also able to send messages back to the HyperCard application. Some XCMD authors added advanced features like full color support (ColorizeHC, HyperTint, AddColor), multiple special-purpose windows (Prompt, Tabloid, Textoid, Listoid, ShowDialog, MegaWindows), drag and drop support and various hardware interfaces to the language.

==Descendants of HyperTalk==
Various scripting languages have implemented a superset of HyperTalk (collectively known as xTalk):
* CompileIt!-Talk – A HyperCard stack and XCMD by Tom Pittman that allowed compiling native 68000 machine code (e.g. for XCMDs and XFCNs) from HyperTalk code, and calling the native Macintosh toolbox routines. CompileIt was bootstrapped, that is, later versions were compiled using earlier versions of itself.
* Double-XX-Talk – Double-XX was a lightweight HyperCard clone that shipped as an addition to CompileIt! and allowed running XCMDs and XFCNs without HyperCard, and even included a small HyperTalk interpreter.
* MediaTalk – The language of Oracle Media Objects, a descendant of Plus, and the first cross-platform HyperCard clone. Furthermore, the only one that was truly modular.
* PlusTalk – The language of Plus, from Spinnaker Software (originally developed by Format Verlag), which was used as the basis for Oracle Media Objects.
* SenseTalk – The language of the NeXT-originated HyperSense and the VNC-based testing tool Eggplant.
* SuperTalk – The language of SuperCard, the first HyperCard clone, by Bill Appleton. Appleton also wrote the popular World Builder adventure construction kit, and HyperDA.
* Transcript (formerly revTalk and MetaTalk) – The language implemented in the LiveCode (formerly Revolution and MetaCard) software platform and development environment. MetaCard was an early Unix-originated HyperCard clone that ran on Classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and Solaris.
* XION - Originally the language of an open-source HyperCard clone that never materialized. Now implemented as OpenXION.
* xTalk - After development of the community version of Livecode was ceased by Livecode, the open source version was forked into what is now OpenXTalk. This fork is under development at the openxtalk.org website.

These clones and dialects (commonly referred to under the moniker of xTalk-languages) added various features to the language that are expected from a modern programming language, like exception handling, user-defined object properties, timers, multi-threading and even user-defined objects.

There are also languages whose syntax and structure show influences from HyperTalk, such as:
* ActionScript – The scripting language for Adobe Flash.
* AppleScript – The main scripting language of Apple&#x27;s Classic Mac OS, and still supported in macOS.
* Lingo – The programming language of Macromedia Director started out with an xTalk-like syntax, although later versions went in a direction resembling JavaScript.
* JavaScript – A scripting language created by Brendan Eich which is commonly implemented as part of a web browser in order to create enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. It was later generalized and standardized as ECMAScript.
* Hyperscript – A scripting language that is designed to used for readable inline scripting and locality of behaviour in HTML, interpreted by a Javascript extension.

Many method names first popularized by HyperTalk have been incorporated into later languages, such as the codice_57 event handler in JavaScript. Although Asymetrix ToolBook is often also considered a HyperCard clone, its scripting language apparently bears little resemblance to HyperTalk.

<text>South Dakota State University (SDSU or SD State) is a public land-grant research university in Brookings, South Dakota, United States. Founded in 1881, it is the state&#x27;s largest university and is the second oldest continually operating university in the state, trailing the University of South Dakota which was founded in 1862. The university is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents, which governs the state&#x27;s six public universities and two special schools.

South Dakota State University is a land-grant university founded under the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Act. This land-grant heritage and mission has led the university to place a special focus on academic programs in agriculture, engineering, nursing, and pharmacy, as well as liberal arts. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The graduate program is classified as Doctoral, Science, Technology, Engineering, Math dominant.

==History==

The university was founded in the Dakota Territory on February 21, 1881, as Dakota Agriculture College. The first building, with funding from the territorial legislature, was built in 1883, six years before the State of South Dakota was formed. Numerous expansions were funded in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name was changed in 1904 to South Dakota State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. In 1964, the name was changed to South Dakota State University. The name change was largely promoted by the Alumni Association. Initiated in 1962, this name change reflected the more comprehensive education offered at the university.

In 1923, SDSU&#x27;s instructional program was organized under five divisions: Agriculture, Engineering, General Science, Home Economics, and Pharmacy. In 1956, a Nursing program was established, and in 1957 a formal graduate school was formed. When the university changed its name in 1964, the colleges were renamed Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Home Economics, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School. In 1974, the College of General Registration (now the College of General Studies) was formed. In 1975, the Division of Education was created. An Honors College was formed in 1999. Two colleges and seven departments combined in 2009 to create the College of Education and Human Sciences.

In 2017, the colleges which make up the university were revised and in some cases renamed to the following: College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences; College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; College of Education and Human Sciences; College of Nursing; College of Pharmacy &amp; Allied Health Professions; 
Graduate School; Jerome J. Lohr College of Engineering; University College; and Van D. and Barbara B. Fishback Honors College.

===Presidents===
On May 23, 2016 (formal inauguration held September 29, 2016), Barry H. Dunn became the 20th President of South Dakota State University. Dunn and his wife are alumni of SDSU, and prior to becoming president, Dunn was the Dean of SDSU&#x27;s College of Agriculture and Biological Sciences.

==Campus==
===Main campus===

The Hilton M. Briggs Library consists of more than 635,000 bound volumes, 315,000 government documents, 79,000 maps, and 1,800 journal titles (with 28,000 additional titles available online). Within the Briggs Library is the Daschle Research Library dedicated to former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (SDSU BA 1969), which houses his Congressional papers.

The University Student Union is at the center of campus and houses many amenities for both students and the public. The Union is the home to numerous meeting rooms, a ballroom, The Hobo Day Committee (homecoming committee), the University Program Council, Greek life the Students&#x27; Association, &quot;The Collegian&quot; student newspaper, Student Legal Services, KSDJ 90.7 FM, Dining Services, four eating facilities, the University Bookstore, Card Services, and International Student Affairs.

==Academics==
SDSU awards associate degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctoral degrees. The university provides 175 fields of study. The university&#x27;s colleges and schools include College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences; College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences; College of Education and Human Sciences; College of Nursing; College of Pharmacy &amp; Allied Health Professions; Graduate School; Jerome J.

===Political Science Department===

SDSU&#x27;s Department of Political Science has been successful in forming many of the state&#x27;s current and past congressional delegations. Currently, two of South Dakota&#x27;s three congressional members are alumni in U.S. Senator Mike Rounds and Governor of South Dakota Kristi Noem. Noem completed her political science degree while she was in Congress. Perhaps the most notable of the program is former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. Former U.S. Representative Stephanie Herseth has served as a professor of the program. The department helped train two Truman Scholars in 2004 and 2006 respectively, including Tony Venhuizen.

===Department of Military Science===
The Department of Military Science commissions officers into the United States Army and United States Air Force through the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program. The department&#x27;s cadets complete the requirements for a bachelor&#x27;s or graduate degree and are then commissioned as second lieutenants.

Some graduates have become general officers, including William E. DePuy, Jake Krull, Raymond W. Carpenter, Franklin J. Blaisdell, Mark A. Clark. Medal of Honor recipients Leo K. Thorsness and Willibald C. Bianchi attended the university.

===Research achievements===
South Dakota State University currently ranks among the Midwest&#x27;s top research universities, notably in the fields of agricultural science, biological science, and engineering. It is consistently listed in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s &quot;Top 200 National Universities&quot; in its college and university rankings.
The campus is also home to the Geospatial Sciences Center of Excellence, a research and educational collaboration with United States Geological Survey Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science. The GSCE focuses on basic and applied research in terrestrial remote sensing. SDSU was recognized in 2017 by ShanghaiRanking Consultancy as the seventh most productive university in the US (and 27th globally) for remote sensing research for the period 2011–2015.

The university operates the South Dakota state agricultural research stations around the state, such as the Antelope Range and Livestock Research Station near Buffalo.
The Great Plains Writers Conference is a venue for significant regional authors or writers interested in the Great Plains. It was instituted at SDSU in 1976 for writing scholarship.

The SDSU Marching Band, &quot;The Pride of the Dakotas,&quot; given the special name the Millennium Band in 2000 by the South Dakota State Legislature, has marched in the 1981 and 1997 Presidential Inaugural Parades in Washington, D.C.; A Capital Fourth in 2000 in Washington, D.C.; the 2003 and 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California; and the Korean War Monument Dedication at the state&#x27;s capital Pierre in 2004. In 2022, the marching band performed in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade the same season they would perform at the FCS title game, seeing the football team win their first FCS National Championship.

=== Homecoming ===
The homecoming celebration, Hobo Day, has been dubbed &quot;The Biggest One-Day Event in the Dakotas.&quot; The celebration is typically held in October, tracing its origins back to 1907.

==Athletics==

SDSU participates in athletics as a member of NCAA Division I. SDSU&#x27;s athletic conference affiliations include the Summit League for most sports, the Missouri Valley Football Conference (Division I FCS), the Big 12 Conference (wrestling) and Varsity Equestrian. The Jackrabbits have 19 varsity sports and numerous intramural and club teams. South Dakota State&#x27;s athletic mascot for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams is the Jackrabbit, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports teams are officially referred to as the Jackrabbits.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The Jackrabbits were NCAA Division II national champions in 1963; they have sinced joined the ranks of Division I.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===

Head coach Aaron Johnston took over the program in 2000. After becoming the first school transitioning to Division I to earn a postseason bid, playing in the WNIT in both 2007 and 2008, SDSU turned its focus to dominating the Summit League. The Jacks have won nine of the 13 conference tournaments they have played in. The program has played in ten NCAA Division I Tournaments, winning four games, highlighted by a trip to the Sweet Sixteen in 2018. The program also won first-round games in 2009 and 2015.

===Men&#x27;s football===

As of January 7, 2024, the Jackrabbits have appeared in the NCAA Division I FCS playoffs 14 times with an overall record of 22–11. They were in the Championship game May 20, 2021, losing 23–21 to Sam Houston State. The Jackrabbits were semifinalists in 2017, 2018, and 2021. SDSU has an active streak of 12 consecutive postseason appearances at the FCS level, including the appearance in 2024. Through 2022, this was accomplished by John Stiegelmeier, the school&#x27;s winningest head coach, after the program managed only one Division II playoff appearance (1979). Beginning in 2023, Jimmy Rogers became the head coach. Zach Zenner became the first Division I football player to record three consecutive seasons of 2,000 rushing yards (2012–14). The program&#x27;s national standing persuaded ESPN&#x27;s College Gameday television show to come to the Brookings campus for a live broadcast of its show on October 26, 2019. The Jackrabbits won their first FCS National Championship following the 2022 season and won their second following the 2023 season on January 7, 2024. 

====Dana Dykhouse buildings and facilities====

<text>USS &quot;R-14&quot; (SS-91) was an &quot;R&quot;-class coastal and harbor defense submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;R-14&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company, in Quincy, Massachusetts, on 6 November 1918. She was launched on 10 October 1919, sponsored by Ms. Florence L. Gardner, and commissioned on 24 December 1919.

==Service history==

===1919–1929===
After a shakedown cruise off the New England coast, &quot;R-14&quot; moved to New London, Connecticut, where she prepared for transfer to the United States Pacific Fleet. In May 1920, she headed south. Given hull classification symbol &quot;SS-91&quot; on 17 July 1920, she transited the Panama Canal in the same month and arrived at Pearl Harbor in the Territory of Hawaii on 6 September 1920. There, for the next nine years, she assisted in the development of submarine warfare and anti-submarine warfare tactics, and participated in search and rescue operations.

&quot;R-14&quot; – under acting command of Lieutenant Alexander Dean Douglas – ran out of usable fuel due to seawater contamination, and lost radio communications in May 1921 while on a surface search mission for the seagoing tug about southeast of the island of Hawaii. Since the submarine&#x27;s electric motors did not have enough battery power to propel her to Hawaii, the ship&#x27;s officers and chief petty officers came up with a novel solution to the problem. It was decided they should try to sail the submarine to the port of Hilo, Hawaii. A foresail was made of eight hammocks hung from a top boom made of pipe bunk frames lashed firmly together, all tied to the vertical kingpost of the torpedo loading crane forward of the submarine&#x27;s superstructure. Seeing that this gave &quot;R-14&quot; a speed of about , as well as rudder control, a mainsail was made of six blankets, hung from the sturdy radio mast (the top sail in the photograph). This added to the speed. A mizzen was then made of eight blankets hung from another top boom made of bunk frames, all tied to the vertically placed boom of the torpedo loading crane. This sail added another . Around 12:30 on 12 May 1921, The crew was able to begin charging the submarine&#x27;s batteries by dragging the propellers through the water while under sail. The windmill effect of these slowly turning propellers turned the generators providing a small amount of voltage that was directed to the batteries. The crew worked together to solve their various problems, and the boat sailed slowly for Hilo. After 64 hours under sail at slightly varying speeds, &quot;R-14&quot; entered Hilo Harbor under battery propulsion on the morning of 15 May 1921. Douglas received a letter of commendation for the crew&#x27;s innovative actions from his submarine division commander, Commander Chester W. Nimitz, USN.

===1930–1946===
On 12 December 1930, &quot;R-14&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for the last time and headed back to the Atlantic. Proceeding via San Diego, California, and the Panama Canal, she returned to New London on 9 February 1931, and through the end of the 1930s conducted training exercises for the Submarine School. In the spring of 1941, she moved down the East Coast of the United States to Key West, Florida, her home port as of 1 June 1941. In the fall of 1941, she returned to New London for overhaul and on 22 November 1941 resumed operations from Key West. Into April 1945, she conducted training exercises for the Sound School and patrolled the Yucatán Channel and the Florida Straits. On 29 June 1943, United States Army Coast Artillery Corps guns at Fort Zachary Taylor mistook &quot;R-14&quot; for a German U-boat and opened fire on her while she was off Key West, but she suffered no damage.

On 25 April 1945, &quot;R-14&quot; departed Key West and headed north, and in early May 1945 she arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was decommissioned on 7 May 1945, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 May 1945, and sold on 28 September 1945 to Rossoff Brothers of New York City. She was later resold to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia and was scrapped in 1946.

<text>USS &quot;R-19&quot; (SS-96) was an R-class coastal and harbor defense submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;R-19&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Union Iron Works of San Francisco on 23 June 1917. She was launched on 28 January 1918 sponsored by Mrs. Robert L. Irvine, and commissioned on 7 October 1918.

==United States Navy service==
After commissioning, which was one month before the Armistice with Germany ending World War I took effect, &quot;R-19&quot; remained on the West Coast of the United States for nine months at San Pedro Submarine Base, San Pedro, Los Angeles until March 1919, and then at San Francisco, undergoing overhaul, until June 1919. On 17 June 1919 &quot;R-19&quot; left the United States for the Territory of Hawaii. Eight days later she reached Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and began almost 12 years of training submarine crews and testing equipment.

During July 1920 the hull classification symbol of &quot;R-19&quot; was changed from &quot;Submarine Number 96&quot; to &quot;SS-96.&quot;

On 12 December 1930, &quot;R-19&quot; left Pearl Harbor for the Philadelphia Navy Yard. &quot;En route&quot; she called at San Diego; voyaged south to the Panama Canal Zone; negotiated the Panama Canal; then voyaged north through the Caribbean Sea and the coastal waters of the US East Coast; and, finally, up Delaware Bay and the Delaware River to Philadelphia.

On 15 May 1931, &quot;R-19&quot; was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and placed in the reserve fleet at that shipyard, where she remained berthed at League Island for the next nine years.

&quot;R-19&quot; was recommissioned on 6 January 1941, then went to the Naval Submarine Base New London at Groton, Connecticut, where she was reconditioned. During May 1941, &quot;R-19&quot; headed south. For the remainder of the spring, summer, and into the fall of 1941, she patrolled and conducted training exercises in the Virgin Islands and off the Panama Canal Zone. In October 1941, &quot;R-19&quot; returned to Groton and continued her role as a training submarine.

On 9 March 1942, &quot;R-19&quot; was decommissioned again.

For her service in the United States Navy, the &quot;R-19&quot; was eligible for the World War I Victory Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.

==Royal Navy service as HMS &quot;P.514&quot;==

&quot;R-19&quot; was transferred to the United Kingdom under the terms of Lend-Lease on 9 March 1942. Commissioned into the Royal Navy, she was renamed HMS &quot;P.514&quot;.

In June 1942 she sailed for St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, under the command of Lieutenant Walter Phillimore, RN. At 0300 on 21 June 1942, while on surface, &quot;P.514&quot; encountered a Royal Canadian Navy minesweeper, , off Newfoundland. Unaware of any friendly submarines in the area and receiving no reply to her challenge, &quot;Georgian&quot; rammed &quot;P.514&quot;, which sank with the loss of all hands.

A Board of Inquiry ruled that &quot;Georgian&quot;″s commanding officer had acted correctly.

Lt. Phillimore&#x27;s parents lived at Swinbrook, Oxfordshire, England. There is a memorial to &quot;P.514&quot;″s officers and men in the Church of England parish church of St. Mary the Virgin in Swinbrook.

<text>Central Washington University (CWU) is a public university in Ellensburg, Washington, United States. 

Founded in 1891, the university consists of four divisions: the President&#x27;s Division, Business and Financial Affairs, Operations, and Academic and Student Life (ASL). Within ASL are four colleges: the College of Arts and Humanities, the College of Business (Ellensburg campus and University Centers in the Puget Sound and central regions), the College of Education and Professional Studies, and College of the Sciences. CWU is considered an emerging Hispanic-Serving Institution and 15 percent of its students are Hispanic.
==History==
In 1890, the state Legislature established the Washington State Normal School (WSNS) in Ellensburg for &quot;the training and education of teachers in the art of instructing and governing in the public schools of this state.&quot; WSNS opened on September 6, 1891, with its first classes held at the Washington Public School in Ellensburg. In 1893, the school&#x27;s first building was constructed and named Barge Hall, in honor of the first WSNS principal, Benjamin Franklin Barge. Barge Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

In subsequent years, the university constructed additional campus buildings to accommodate a growing student body including: Kamola Hall (1911); Smyser Hall (1925); Munson Hall (1926); Sue Lombard Hall (1926); and McConnell Auditorium (1935). While Barge Hall&#x27;s architecture reflected a Richardsonian Romanesque style, the designs of later buildings incorporated elements of proto-Modernism, along with Spanish Colonial Revival, Neo-Classical and Classical Revival styles. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as academic programs expanded, construction of new buildings took place: the Science Building I (1997); Black Hall (1998); the Student Union and Recreation Center (2006); Jerilyn McIntyre Music Education Facility (2007); Wendell Hill Hall and Mechanical Building (2008), Barto Hall (2012), Science Building II (2016), and the Samuelson STEM Center (2018).

In 1937, the Washington Legislature authorized a name change to Central Washington College of Education. In 1961, reflecting that the curriculum had expanded into new areas of study in addition to teacher education, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Central Washington State College. With addition of graduate programs and curricula, it became Central Washington University in 1977.

In 1998, the United Faculty of Central was founded as a trade union to represent the university&#x27;s faculty members.

== Residential campus ==

The residential campus location has multiple residence halls, surrounding the Student Union and Recreation Center, and clustered in four different areas. The STEM and teaching facilities are located near the administrative buildings, which include Black Hall, Bouillon Hall, and the Science Building near Dean Hall (see map on right).



=== Administrative buildings ===
Barge Hall and Mitchell Hall are where the primary administrative staff are located. Admissions, Running Start, a Cashiers Office, the Registrar, and financial aid are all located in this area. This region is bounded by Samuelson Hall and the residential Kamola Hall and Sue Lombard Hall.

=== Student Union and Recreation Center ===
On April 26, 2006, the school opened the $58 million Student Union and Recreation Center. The Student Union and Recreation Center, or SURC as it is abbreviated by students, is home to a full-sized rock-climbing wall, fully equipped gymnasium, and an outdoor recreation office that rents sports equipment.

=== Wildcat Farm ===
The Wildcat Farm at the eastern side of campus grows fresh produce for CWU Dining Services and provides space for students and faculty to run experiments or projects centered around food and farming. Examples have included studying soil carbon respiration, offering K-12 education programs, and piloting dryland winter wheat production.

== CWU University Centers ==
In addition to the residential campus in Ellensburg, Central Washington University has multiple locations around the state of Washington.

* CWU-Des Moines, located at Highline Community College
* CWU-Everett, located at Everett Community College
* CWU-Lynnwood, located at Edmonds College
* CWU-Pierce County, located at Pierce College
* CWU-Moses Lake, located at Big Bend Community College
* CWU-Sammamish, located at the city-owned facility at 120 228th Ave. N.E.
* CWU-Wenatchee, located at Wenatchee Valley College
* CWU-Yakima, located at Yakima Valley College

==Research==

===Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA)===
The Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array (PANGA) uses real-time GPS measurements to research and measure crustal deformation and mitigate natural hazards throughout the Pacific Northwest. These hazards arise from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and coastal sea-level encroachment. In addition, PANGA GPS measurements are used to monitor man-made structures such as Seattle&#x27;s sagging Alaskan Way Viaduct (demolished in 2019), the 520 and I-90 floating bridges, and power-generation / drinking-supply dams throughout the Cascadia subduction zone, including the mega-dams along the Columbia River. GPS data are telemetered in real-time back to CWU, where they are processed in real-time using both JPL&#x27;s RTG software as well as Trimble&#x27;s RTKNet Integrity Manager software to provide relative positioning of several mm resolution.

===Primate Behavior and Ecology program===
The Primate Behavior and Ecology program at Central Washington University offers the only baccalaureate degree in primatology in the world and the sole master&#x27;s degree in primatology in the United States. The program focuses on non-invasive, observational research with nonhuman primates in field and captive settings. The program also offers the only Captive Primate Care Certificate in the United States and is affiliated with Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest. Faculty and students study across the entire primate order, collaborating with scientists and conducting research at sites around the world. Recent published work includes the impact of COVID-19 on mammals at tourism sites, the behavior of Tibetan macaques at the Valley of the Wild Monkeys in China, and the social networks of chimpanzees. The Primate Behavior graduate program is part of the Western Regional Graduate Program, through which student residents of 15 western states pay in-state tuition.

===Wine Quality Research Initiative===
Wine Quality Research Initiative has identified the nature of wine faults in some wines and how to prevent them. Currently the initiative is directed at detecting and preventing wine fraud, a lucrative and growing crime in the wine import/export business.

==Athletics==

CWU students, alumni, and varsity athletes are known as the &quot;Wildcats&quot; and their colors are crimson and black. CWU is part of NCAA Division II and is part of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. However, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby teams are NCAA Division I and are usually nationally ranked.

<doc id="78145" wikidata="Q2070380" url="?curid=78145" title="The Tombs of Atuan">
<text>The Tombs of Atuan is a fantasy novel by the American author Ursula K. Le Guin, first published in the Winter 1970 issue of &quot;Worlds of Fantasy&quot;, and published as a book by Atheneum Books in 1971. It is the second book in the Earthsea series after &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; (1969). &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; was a Newbery Honor Book in 1972.

Set in the fictional world of Earthsea, &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; follows the story of Tenar, a young girl born in the Kargish empire, who is taken while still a child to be the high priestess to the &quot;Nameless Ones&quot; at the Tombs of Atuan. Her existence at the Tombs is a lonely one, deepened by the isolation of being the highest ranking priestess. Her world is disrupted by the arrival of Ged, the protagonist of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, who seeks to steal the half of a talisman buried in the treasury of the Tombs. Tenar traps him in the labyrinth under the Tombs, but then rebels against her teaching and keeps him alive. Through him she learns more of the outside world, and begins to question her faith in the Nameless Ones and her place at the Tombs.

Like &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; is a bildungsroman that explores Tenar&#x27;s growth and identity. Tenar&#x27;s coming-of-age is closely tied to her exploration of faith and her belief in the Nameless Ones. &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; explores themes of gender and power in the setting of a cult of female priests in service to a patriarchal society, while providing an anthropological view of Kargish culture. Tenar, who became the subject of Le Guin&#x27;s fourth Earthsea novel, &quot;Tehanu&quot;, has been described as a more revolutionary protagonist than Ged, or Arren, the protagonist of &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; (1972), the third Earthsea volume. Whereas the two men grow into socially approved roles, Tenar rebels and struggles against the confines of her social role. &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; shares elements of the story of a heroic quest with other Earthsea novels, but subverts some of the tropes common to the genre of fantasy at the time, such as by choosing a female protagonist, and a dark-skinned leading character.

&quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; was well received when it was published, with critics commenting favorably on the character of Tenar, Le Guin&#x27;s writing, and her &quot;sensitive&quot; portrayal of cultural differences between the Kargish people and the people of the rest of Earthsea. The story received praise for its exploration of religious themes and ethical questions. Le Guin&#x27;s treatment of gender was criticized by several scholars, who stated that she had created a female protagonist, but within a male-dominated framework. Nonetheless, the novel has been described by scholars and commentators as &quot;beautifully written&quot;, and a &quot;significant exploration of womanhood&quot;.

== Background ==
Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s universe of Earthsea first appeared in two short stories, &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot; (1964), both published in &quot;Fantastic&quot;. These stories developed early concepts for the fictional world. They were both later anthologized in Le Guin&#x27;s collection &quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot;, published in 1975. Earthsea was the setting for a story Le Guin wrote in 1965 or 1966, which was never published. In 1967, Herman Schein (the publisher of Parnassus Press and the husband of Ruth Robbins, the illustrator of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;) asked Le Guin to try writing a book &quot;for older kids&quot;, giving her complete freedom over the subject and the approach. Drawing from her short stories, Le Guin began work on &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;. Le Guin has said that the book was in part a response to the image of wizards as ancient and wise, and to her wondering where they come from. Le Guin later said that her choice of fantasy as a medium, and of the theme of coming of age, was a product of her writing for adolescents.

The short stories published in 1964 introduced the world of Earthsea and important concepts in it, such as Le Guin&#x27;s treatment of magic. Le Guin&#x27;s depiction of Earthsea was influenced by her familiarity with Native American legends as well as Norse mythology. The influence of Norse lore can be seen in the characters of the Kargs, who are blonde and blue-eyed, and worship two gods who are brothers. Influential in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; is Le Guin&#x27;s familiarity with anthropology, visible in her description of Kargish culture and cultural differences with the rest of Earthsea. Le Guin&#x27;s belief in Taoism is visible in the idea of a cosmic &quot;balance&quot; in the universe of Earthsea. Le Guin originally intended for &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; to be a standalone novel, but she wrote &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; as a sequel after considering the loose ends in the first book, and wrote a third book, &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;, a year later after further consideration. Scholars have stated that the civil rights movement, and opposition to the Vietnam War that was gaining prominence during the period &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; was written, subtly affected the structure of the book. Although not a &quot;primarily feminist&quot; novel, Le Guin&#x27;s decision to choose a female protagonist has been described as a nod to the women&#x27;s rights movement, while Tenar&#x27;s growing disquiet with her beliefs has been compared to the unease of individuals who began to protest discrimination and the Vietnam War.

==Setting==

Earthsea is an archipelago, or group of islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. Influenced strongly by Le Guin&#x27;s interest in Taoism, the world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody in each of the original trilogy of novels. Magic in the societies of Earthsea is depicted as a force for both good and evil. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. The internal universe of Earthsea has not remained constant across Le Guin&#x27;s various works set in it, but has been continually adjusted and revised.

Some of the North-eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The Kargish peoples have a distinct culture and geography: for example, they do not use written language, as they consider it an evil practice. The Kargish people have been described by scholars as being the analog of people in the United States; similarities include an organized religion, and a class system. This society does not believe in the equilibrium that the rest of the archipelago believes in, and does not believe in magic either. The Kargad empire is a theocracy; its monarch, the God-king, claims to represent the power of the Nameless Ones, described as the &quot;powers of the dark, of ruin, of madness&quot;. The society is depicted as militant, and patriarchal. Le Guin suggests that though the God-king relies upon the Nameless Ones and their high priestess to maintain his authority, he no longer believes in them.

==Plot summary==

The story follows a girl named Tenar, born on the Kargish island of Atuan. Born on the day that the high priestess of the Tombs of Atuan died, she is believed to be her reincarnation. Tenar is taken from her family when five years old and goes to the Tombs. Her name is taken from her in a ceremony, and she is referred to as &quot;Arha&quot;, or the &quot;eaten one&quot;, after being consecrated to the service of the &quot;Nameless Ones&quot; at the age of six with a ceremony involving a symbolic sacrifice. She moves into her own tiny house, and is given a eunuch servant, Manan, with whom she develops a bond of affection.

Arha&#x27;s childhood and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She is trained in her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and the labyrinth beneath the Tombs, teaching her how to find her way around them. She tells of the treasure hidden within the labyrinth, which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in the Tombs. She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to the Tombs by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she has them killed by starvation, an act which haunts her for a long time. After Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha and sees the Nameless Ones as a threat to her power.

Arha&#x27;s routine is disrupted by her discovery of the wizard Ged (the protagonist of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt to open the door with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth, Ged eventually collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him, she learns that he has come to the Tombs for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by pure chance, and a dragon later told him what it was. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged&#x27;s existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with it. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.

Arha and Kossil have a public falling out, in which Kossil says that nobody believes in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response, Arha curses her in the name of the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads to the labyrinth and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe&#x27;s ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service, but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed when he attempts to attack Ged. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide, she feels an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar sail to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.

==Major characters==
===Tenar===
Tenar, from whose perspective &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; is told, is born on the Kargish island of Atuan before being taken away to serve the Nameless Ones as their high priestess. She is told that she is the reincarnation of the high priestess, and has lived at the tombs since time immemorial; though she believes this early in her life, she begins to question the idea later in the novel. For much of the book she is known only as Arha, or the &quot;Eaten one&quot;; her identity as an individual is gradually erased. Though she is depicted as a person of strength and imagination, her development is stunted by the priestesses; her feelings are repressed, and her mind has no place to wander except the labyrinth. After trapping Ged, she talks to him about the rest of Earthsea, and begins to desire a life outside the barrenness of the Tombs. It is only after her escape that she seems to regain her name, crying &quot;I have my name back. I am Tenar!&quot; &quot;Tehanu&quot;, the fourth Earthsea novel, is narrated from Tenar&#x27;s point of view; it depicts her life on Gont and her reunion and relationship with Ged. She reappears in &quot;The Other Wind&quot;, the sixth Earthsea book. Tenar is paired with Ged in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, the two sharing power to create a more powerful combination. Tenar is part of multiple pairs of characters that develop together; both Ged, in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, and later Tehanu in her eponymous novel, are shown as being dependent on her.

===Ged===
Ged, who in the story goes by his common name of &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;, only enters the novel midway through when he comes to the tombs to steal the ring of Erreth-Akbe. Where he was an adolescent in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, he is depicted as a mature individual in the second Earthsea volume, one who gradually transforms Tenar&#x27;s view of the world. In &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, he plays the role of the wise helper to the protagonist, a type of companionship common to Le Guin&#x27;s novels. After Tenar chooses to talk to him rather than have him killed, he tells her about the rest of Earthsea that she is ignorant of, and so helps her see a path out of her difficulties that she could not. The scars that Ged bears from his encounter with the shadow in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot; make Tenar realize that he has confronted death in a way that she has never done. Literature scholar Elizabeth Cummins argues that while Ged does not actually save Tenar, he &quot;functions as the midwife in her rebirth&quot;. Ged is the figure of the &quot;other&quot; in this novel; in contrast to the other inhabitants of the Tombs, he is male, dark-skinned, and a wizard. Ged&#x27;s difference in the story is symbolized by light on many occasions, such as when his staff allows Tenar to see the undertomb for the first time: she is shocked then to find it to be beautiful, rather than just dark. Ged is responsible for giving Tenar a wider perspective and showing her a more compassionate and joyful world than her previous experience allowed her to imagine.

==Themes==
===Coming of age===
As with &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; is a &quot;bildungsroman&quot; or coming-of-age story, this time from the perspective of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar&#x27;s choices have direct social consequences. While Ged&#x27;s growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar&#x27;s development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. The labyrinth, in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar&#x27;s exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, the labyrinth symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her for execution.

After this incident, she falls ill and experiences nightmares, suggesting that when she underwent the rituals that made her the &quot;eaten one&quot;, some of her personality and her regard for life remained. She questions her faith (another theme that runs through the novel), and begins to develop a sense of self apart from it, helped in this process by Ged. She wrestles with her contradictory thoughts for a long time; keeping Ged alive would be contrary to all her teachings and the powers she serves, but sacrificing him would be contrary to her developing respect for life. An important moment in this process is when Ged calls her by her true name, and clarifies for her the choice between remaining in the Tombs as Arha and embracing Tenar and stepping into the larger world of Earthsea. Afterwards, she has a nightmare about suffocating, a motif Cummins describes as being common to female coming-of-age stories.

The hold that the darkness has over her does not disappear when she escapes and the Tombs are brought down in an earthquake by the nameless ones. She contemplates killing Ged, blaming him for her pain. Eventually, she learns to accept her guilt over her actions, realizing that though she had no choice in her actions as a priestess, she now has a choice to move away from them; however, this &quot;freedom is a heavy load&quot;. Le Guin ends the novel with the reassuring sentence &quot;Gravely she walked beside [Ged] up the white streets of Havnor, holding his hand, like a child coming home&quot;, suggesting that she has been successful in finding new connections in her life. The conclusion of the novel represents the successful end of a quest that Ged undertook as a mature wizard, part of the story arc that traces his character development across the first three Earthsea books; thus &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; has been described as part of Ged&#x27;s coming-of-age as well.

===Faith and belief===
The notion of faith and deep belief is a large part of the novel, and is related to the book&#x27;s other theme of identity. Throughout the story there is a tension between faith in the Nameless Ones and their power, and human curiosity and the tendency to question. The importance of tradition and belief in Kargish culture is emphasized when Tenar is taken from her family, and chosen to be the high priestess of the Tombs. However, Tenar&#x27;s mother unsuccessfully tries to dupe the priestesses into believing the child has a skin disease. Commentators state that this episode suggests certain universal impulses can lead to resistance against &quot;cultural imperatives&quot;; Tenar&#x27;s mother is willing to bend the rules to keep her child. Unlike the rest of Earthsea, which relies on the &quot;Old Speech&quot; for its magic and rituals, the Kargish lands use their own tongue, and rituals are conducted with meaningless babble; thus from the moment the chanting of the priestesses is described, Le Guin suggests that the Kargish faith is one of meaningless words and ritual. The Kargish deities are revered as the &quot;Nameless Ones&quot;; thus Ged&#x27;s statement to Arha that all things have names also works to undermine her faith.

Tenar begins to question her beliefs when she hears Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees that they do not punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an &quot;unfaith&quot; in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, &quot;she felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter.&quot; Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar&#x27;s own. After speaking to him, she begins to wonder whether the Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.

===Gender and power===
Gender and power feature as themes through &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;. The labyrinth has been described as a tomb for the lives that Kargish women could have led. Le Guin herself stated that the theme of &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; was sex, a statement which reviewers have suggested meant not physical intimacy, but yearning and the recognition of potential for intimacy. The role of the women priestesses at the Tombs is analogous to that of Kargish women in their society; though the priestesses have eunuch servants and male guards ostensibly to protect them, the Tombs are a prison, and act to isolate the women from the rest of society. The priestesses have internalized this situation, and act to enforce it: Kossil&#x27;s cruelty is described as epitomizing this. Brought into this environment, Tenar&#x27;s development as a person is not the result of choices she made, as is the case with Ged in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;; instead, her coming of age is forced upon her.

Despite the fact that Tenar does not become a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary character of &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot;), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male &quot;bildungsroman&quot; in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar&#x27;s coming of age is a female &quot;bildungsroman&quot;, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply for her role as a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.

== Style and structure ==
The novels of the Earthsea cycle differ notably from Le Guin&#x27;s early Hainish cycle works, written during the same period. Fantasy scholar George Slusser described them as providing a counterweight to the &quot;excessive pessimism&quot; of the Hainish novels. He saw the former as depicting individual action in a favorable light, in contrast to works such as &quot;Vaster than Empires and More Slow&quot;. The trilogy shares a thematic similarity in that each volume is a &quot;bildungsroman&quot; for a different character; the first for Ged, the second for Tenar, and the third for Arren.

Though the structure of the Earthsea novels is in many ways typical of fantasy, it has been described as subverting the tropes of this genre. The protagonists of her stories, with the exception of Tenar, were all dark-skinned, in comparison to the white-skinned heroes more traditionally used. The &quot;Tombs of Atuan&quot; examines the development of a young girl in great detail, a choice unusual for a fantasy writer of the period in which the book was written.

The early part of the story provides an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. Scholars have described Le Guin&#x27;s depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the early part of the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged&#x27;s arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.

The form of narrative employed by Le Guin in the Earthsea trilogy has been described by literature scholar Mike Cadden as &quot;free indirect discourse&quot;; a technique in which the feelings of the protagonist are not directly separated from the narration, making the narrator seem sympathetic to the characters, and removing the skepticism towards a character&#x27;s thoughts and emotions that are a feature of more direct narration. Cadden suggests that this method leads to younger readers sympathizing directly with the characters, thereby making it an effective technique for young-adult literature, whereas adults are likely to read the situations differently. In &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, much of the story is told from Tenar&#x27;s perspective; for instance, the reader sees Tenar&#x27;s fear of the undertomb through her own eyes, creating an empathy for her.

Scholars have compared &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; to &quot;The Beginning Place&quot;, another of Le Guin&#x27;s fantasy works; both stories have a female protagonist guiding a blundering male through a labyrinth of sorts. Comparisons have been made to a number of Le Guin&#x27;s works which have a notion of a dream world in which the protagonists undergo a transformation; in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, this is the labyrinth. Ged&#x27;s journey through the series has been compared to the traditional heroic quest, including a &quot;descent into the underworld&quot; represented by the labyrinth in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;. It has drawn comparisons to the character of Alvin in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novella &quot;The City and the Stars&quot;.

==Publication and reception==
A shorter version of &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; was published in the magazine &quot;Worlds of Fantasy&quot; in the Winter 1970 issue. The complete version was published by Atheneum Books in 1971. It was the second book of the original Earthsea &quot;trilogy&quot;, being preceded by &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;, and followed by &quot;The Farthest Shore&quot; in 1972. &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; has since been translated into more than 20 languages, and has been reprinted many times. The first three Earthsea novels received critical acclaim as works for children when they were published. The classification of the original trilogy as children&#x27;s literature was decried by many critics, such as Barbara Bucknall, who stated that the stories were &quot;ageless because they deal with problems that confront us at any age&quot;, and could be read by both children and adults. It took several decades and the publication of a fourth novel, &quot;Tehanu&quot; for the series to be recognized as adult literature. Two more books were published in subsequent years; &quot;Tales from Earthsea&quot; and &quot;The Other Wind&quot;, both in 2001. These books, along with &quot;Tehanu&quot;, have sometimes been referred to as a second trilogy. &quot;Tehanu&quot; has been described as a rewriting or reimagining of &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, because Tenar&#x27;s power and status are the inverse of what they were in the earlier book. In 2005 an original mini-series titled &quot;Legend of Earthsea&quot;, based loosely on the first two Earthsea books was broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel. Le Guin expressed strong displeasure with the result, which she said had &quot;whitewashed Earthsea&quot;.

&quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; was a Newbery Honor Book in 1972, but did not win any other major awards before being a runner-up for the International Children&#x27;s Literature Association&#x27;s Phoenix Award twenty years after its first publication. Upon its publication British critic Naomi Lewis called it an &quot;extraordinary book&quot;, while scholar Andrew Wolk called the series a masterpiece of fantasy. The prose in the novel received praise; a 1996 reference book on science fiction described them as among the best regarded fantasies, and went on to call the series a &quot;fast-paced narrative&quot; that explored serious questions of morality, power, and identity, Science fiction writer Jo Walton said that it was a &quot;beautifully written&quot; book. She went on to write that a &quot;lesser writer&quot; would have ended the novel after the earthquake and the collapse of the Tombs, but that the last section of the story, about Ged and Tenar&#x27;s travel, &quot;do a lot to ground it&quot;, making it &quot;solid and well rooted as ever&quot;. Speculative fiction scholar Mike Cadden praised the characterization in the novel, calling Tenar the &quot;finest and most complicated multiple character in the Earthsea series, and maybe in all of her fiction&quot;. However, scholar Sandra Lindow referred to the conclusion of the novel, and particularly the conclusion of Ged and Tenar&#x27;s relationship, as unsatisfying. A 2016 review in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; praised the religious theme in the novel, saying Le Guin &quot;skillfully illustrates the way religious conviction can permeate and give meaning to a life&quot;, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; referred to it as &quot;a classic of stealth-missile literature, a fantasy adventure that&#x27;s actually a feminist horror thriller&quot;.

Le Guin&#x27;s portrayal of the cultural differences between the Kargish lands and the rest of Earthsea has been praised as &quot;sensitive&quot;, while her use of the theme of gender has been referred to as a &quot;significant exploration of womanhood&quot;. Nonetheless, Le Guin&#x27;s treatment of gender in &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, and in the first three Earthsea volumes in general, has been questioned by critics, who suggest that it perpetuates a male-dominated model of the world of Earthsea. The unhealthy cult depicted at the Tombs serves only to reinforce the moral superiority of the school of Roke depicted in &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea&quot;; the school is run entirely by men. Some feminist scholars have criticized &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; for depicting the &quot;suppression&quot; of a female cult. Other scholars dispute this description, arguing that the &quot;cult&quot; in question is in fact shown as evil, and is moreover not acting of its free will; it is already subordinate to the will of a male king. Speaking decades after the publication of &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;, Le Guin stated that she considered &quot;The Eye of the Heron&quot; (published in 1978, seven years after &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot;) to be her first novel not centered on a man; critics have interpreted this to mean that Le Guin considered &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; to be a male-centered book. However in the afterword to the 2018 illustrated edition Le Guin writes &quot;It was the first book I wrote with a woman as the true central character.&quot;

<text>Yakima ( or ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Yakima County, Washington, United States, and the state&#x27;s 11th most populous city. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 96,968 and a metropolitan population of 256,728. The unincorporated suburban areas of West Valley and Terrace Heights are considered a part of greater Yakima.

Yakima is about southeast of Mount Rainier in Washington. It is situated in the Yakima Valley, a productive agricultural region noted for apple, wine, and hop production. As of 2011, the Yakima Valley produces 77% of all hops grown in the United States. The name Yakima originates from the Yakama Nation Native American tribe, whose reservation is located south of the city.

==History==
The Yakama people were the first known inhabitants of the Yakima Valley. In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition came to the area and encountered abundant wildlife and rich soil, prompting the settlement of homesteaders. A Catholic Mission was established in Ahtanum, southwest of present-day Yakima, in 1847. The arrival of settlers and their conflicts with the natives resulted in the Yakima War. The U.S. Army established Fort Simcoe in 1856 near present-day White Swan as a response to the uprising. The Yakamas were defeated and forced to relocate to the Yakama Indian Reservation.

Yakima County was created in 1865. When bypassed by the Northern Pacific Railroad in December 1884, over 100 buildings were moved with rollers and horse teams to the nearby site of the depot. The new city was dubbed North Yakima and was officially incorporated and named the county seat on January 27, 1886. The name was changed to Yakima in 1918. Union Gap was the new name given to the original site of Yakima.

On May 18, 1980, the eruption of Mount St. Helens caused a large amount of volcanic ash to fall on the Yakima area. Visibility was reduced to near-zero conditions that afternoon, and the ash overloaded the city&#x27;s wastewater treatment plant.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.84% is water. Yakima is 1,095 feet above mean sea level.

The city of Yakima is located in the Upper Valley of Yakima County. The county is geographically divided by Ahtanum Ridge and Rattlesnake Ridge into two regions: the Upper (northern) and Lower (southern) valleys. Yakima is located in the more urbanized Upper Valley, and is the central city of the Yakima Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The unincorporated suburban areas of West Valley and Terrace Heights are considered a part of greater Yakima. Other nearby cities include Moxee, Tieton, Cowiche, Wiley City, Tampico, Gleed, and Naches in the Upper Valley, as well as Wapato, Toppenish, Zillah, Harrah, White Swan, Parker, Buena, Outlook, Granger, Mabton, Sunnyside, and Grandview in the Lower Valley.

===Bodies of water===
The Yakima River runs through the city from its source at Lake Keechelus in the Cascade Range to the Columbia River at Richland. It is the primary irrigation source for the Yakima Valley and also used for both fishing and recreation. The Naches River, a tributary of the Yakima River, forms the northern border of the city. 

The Yakima Greenway is a system of parks, paved pathways, and nature reserves along the Yakima and Naches rivers. The community project was formed in 1983 with work to reclaim a former city landfill into a park, which opened in 1990 as Sarg Hubbard Park.

Several small lakes flank the northern edge of the city, including Myron Lake, Lake Aspen, Bergland Lake (private) and Rotary Lake (also known as Freeway Lake). These lakes are popular with fishermen and swimmers during the summer.

===Climate===

Autumn cooling is very rapid, with the average first freeze of the season occurring on September 30. Due to the city&#x27;s location in a rain shadow, precipitation, at an average of annually, is low year-round, but especially during summer. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on February 1, 1950, to on June 29, 2021.

==Economy==
Yakima&#x27;s growth in the 20th century was fueled primarily by agriculture. The Yakima Valley produces many fruit crops, including apples, peaches, pears, cherries, and melons. Many vegetables are also produced, including peppers, corn and beans. Most of the nation&#x27;s hops, a key ingredient in the production of beer, are also grown in the Yakima Valley. Many of the city&#x27;s residents have come to the valley out of economic necessity and to participate in the picking, processing, marketing and support services for the agricultural economy.

===Top employers===
According to the City&#x27;s 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

Downtown Yakima, long the retail hub of the region, has undergone many changes since the late 1990s. Three major department stores, and an entire shopping mall that is now closed, have been replaced by a Whirlpool Corporation facility (shut down in 2011), an Adaptis call center, and several hotels. The region&#x27;s retail core has shifted to the town of Union Gap to a renovated shopping mall and other new retail businesses. The Downtown Futures Initiative promotes the downtown area as a center for events, services, entertainment, and small, personal shopping experiences. The DFI has provided for street-to-storefront remodeling along Yakima Avenue throughout the entire downtown core, and includes new pedestrian-friendly lighting, water fountains, planters, banner poles, new trees and hanging baskets, and paver-inlaid sidewalks.

Events held downtown include Yakima Downtown New Year&#x27;s Eve, a Cinco de Mayo celebration, Yakima Live music festival, Yakima Summer Kickoff Party, Fresh Hop Ale Fest, a weekly Farmers&#x27; Market, and the Hot Shots 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament.

Over ninety wineries are in the Yakima Valley.

The Yakima Training Center, between Yakima and Ellensburg, is a United States Army training center. It is used primarily for maneuver training and land warrior system testing, and has a live-fire area. Artillery units from the Canadian Armed Forces based in British Columbia, as well as the Japan Ground Self Defense Force, conduct annual training in Yakima. Japanese soldiers train there because it allows for large-scale live-fire maneuvers not available in Japan. Similarly, it is the closest impact area for the Canadian Gunners, the next closest being in Wainwright, Alberta.

==Tourism==

In the early 2000s, the city of Yakima, in conjunction with multiple city organizations, began revitalization and preservation efforts in its historic downtown area. The Downtown Yakima Futures Initiative was created to make strategic public investments in sidewalks, lighting and landscaping to encourage further development. As a result, local businesses featuring regional produce, wines, and beers, among other products, have returned to the downtown area. Many of these businesses are located on Front Street, Yakima Avenue and 1st Street.

During the summer, a pair of historic trolleys operate along five miles (8 km) of track of the former Yakima Valley Transportation Company through the Yakima Gap connecting Yakima and Selah. The Yakima Valley Trolleys organization, incorporated in 2001, operates the trolleys and a museum for the City of Yakima.

The City of Yakima expanded the Convention Center in 2020.

==Arts and culture==

Cultural activities and events take place throughout the year. The Yakima Valley Museum houses exhibits related to the region&#x27;s natural and cultural history, a restored soda fountain, and periodic special exhibitions. Downtown Yakima&#x27;s historic Capitol Theatre and Seasons Performance Hall, as well as the West-side&#x27;s Allied Arts Center, present numerous musical and stage productions. Larson Gallery housed at Yakima Valley College present six diverse art exhibitions each year. The city is home to the Yakima Symphony Orchestra. The Yakima Area Arboretum is a botanical garden featuring species of both native and adapted non-native plants. Popular music tours, trade shows, and other large events are hosted at the Yakima SunDome in State Fair Park.

==Government==
Yakima is one of the ten first class cities, those with a population over 10,000 at the time of reorganization and operating under a home rule charter.

The Yakima City Council operates under the council–manager form of government. The city council has seven members, elected by district and the mayor is elected by the council members. Yakima&#x27;s city manager serves under the direction of the City Council, and administers and coordinates the delivery of municipal services. The city of Yakima is a full-service city, providing police, fire, water and wastewater treatment, parks, public works, planning, street maintenance, code enforcement, airport and transit to residents.

In 1994 and 2015, the City of Yakima received the All-America City Award, given by the National Civic League. Ten U.S. cities receive this award per year.

The city council was elected at-large until a 2012 lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union was ruled in the favor of Latino constituents on the grounds of racial discrimination. The council&#x27;s four district-based and three at-large seat arrangement was also removed in favor of seven districts—of which two have a Latino majority. The city manager position has been vacant since January 2024, when the new city council removed incumbent Bob Harrison. Several attempts were made in the early 2020s to move Yakima to a mayor–council form of government.

The citizens of Yakima are represented in the Washington Senate by Republicans Curtis King in District 14, and Nikki Torres in District 15, and in the Washington House of Representatives by Republicans Chris Corry and Gina Mosbrucker in District 14, and Republicans Bruce Chandler and Bryan Sandlin in District 15.

<doc id="78147" wikidata="Q12603" url="?curid=78147" title="Pacific Northwest">
<text>The Pacific Northwest (PNW; ), sometimes referred to as Cascadia, is a geographic region in Western North America bounded by its coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean to the west and, loosely, by the Rocky Mountains to the east. Though no official boundary exists, the most common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and the Canadian province of British Columbia. Some broader conceptions reach north into Alaska and Yukon, south into Northern California, and east into western Montana. Other conceptions may be limited to the coastal areas west of the Cascade and Coast mountains.

The Northwest Coast is the coastal region of the Pacific Northwest, and the Northwest Plateau (also commonly known as &quot;the Interior&quot; in British Columbia), is the inland region. The term &quot;Pacific Northwest&quot; should not be confused with the Northwest Territory (also known as the Great Northwest, a historical term in the United States) or the Northwest Territories of Canada. The region is sometimes referred to as Cascadia, which, depending on the borders, may or may not be the same thing as the Pacific Northwest.

The region&#x27;s largest metropolitan areas are Greater Seattle, Washington, with 4 million people; Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, with 2.84 million people; and Greater Portland, Oregon, with 2.5 million people.

The culture of the Pacific Northwest is influenced by the Canada–United States border, which the United States and the United Kingdom established at a time when the region&#x27;s inhabitants were composed mostly of indigenous peoples. Two sections of the border—one along the 49th parallel south of British Columbia and one between the Alaska Panhandle and northern British Columbia—have left a great impact on the region. According to Canadian historian Ken Coates, the border has not merely influenced the Pacific Northwest—rather, &quot;the region&#x27;s history and character have been determined by the boundary&quot;.

==Definition ==
Definitions of the &quot;Pacific Northwest&quot; region vary, and even Pacific Northwesterners do not agree on the exact boundary. The most common conception includes the U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and the Canadian province of British Columbia.

Broader definitions of the region have included the U.S. states of Alaska and parts of the states of California, Montana, and Wyoming, and the Canadian territory of Yukon.

Definitions based on the historic Oregon Country reach east to the Continental Divide, thus including all of western Montana and western Wyoming. Sometimes, the Pacific Northwest is defined as being the Northwestern United States specifically, excluding Canada.

==History==

===Indigenous peoples===
The Pacific Northwest has been occupied by a diverse array of indigenous peoples for millennia. The Pacific Coast is seen by some scholars as a major coastal migration route in the settlement of the Americas by late Pleistocene peoples moving from northeast Asia into the Americas.

The coastal migration hypothesis has been bolstered by findings such as the report that the sediments in the Port Eliza Cave on Vancouver Island indicate the possibility of survivable climate as far back as 16 kya (16,000 years ago) in the area, while the continental ice sheets were nearing their maximum extent. Other evidence for human occupation dating back as much as 14.5 kya (14,500 years ago) is emerging from Paisley Caves in south-central Oregon. However, despite such research, the coastal migration hypothesis is still subject to considerable debate.

Due in part to the richness of Pacific Northwest Coast and river fisheries, some of the indigenous peoples developed complex sedentary societies, while remaining hunter-gatherers. The Pacific Northwest Coast is one of the few places where politically complex hunter-gatherers evolved and survived to historic contacts, and therefore has been vital for anthropologists and archaeologists seeking to understand how complex hunter and gatherer societies function. When Europeans first arrived on the Northwest Coast, they found one of the world&#x27;s most complex hunting and fishing societies, with large sedentary villages, large houses, systems of social rank and prestige, extensive trade networks, and many other factors more commonly associated with societies based on domesticated agriculture. In the interior of the Pacific Northwest, the indigenous peoples, at the time of European contact, had a diversity of cultures and societies. Some areas were home to mobile and egalitarian societies. Others, especially along major rivers such as the Columbia and Fraser, had very complex, affluent, sedentary societies rivaling those of the coast.

In British Columbia and Southeast Alaska, the Haida and Tlingit erected large and elaborately carved totem poles that have become iconic of Pacific Northwest artistic traditions. Throughout the Pacific Northwest, thousands of indigenous people live, and some continue to practice their rich cultural traditions, &quot;organizing their societies around cedar and salmon&quot;.

===Initial European exploration===
Sailing for the Spanish Crown, 
Portuguese navigator Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo became in 1542 the first European to explore the west coast of today&#x27;s United States and reached as far as Punta del Año Nuevo, north of Monterrey. Bartolomé Ferrer continued on and may have reached as far north as the Rogue River on the Oregon coast.

By 1579, English captain and erstwhile privateer Francis Drake sailed up the west coast of North America during the course of his circumnavigation undertaking. Drake may have reached as far North as 48N and may have conducted some preliminary assessments of the western entry channels to the Northwest Passage under royal secrecy order. He then headed back south to land, to careen the ship, to rest and to continue on the undertaking. Drake and his crew eventually found a protected cove where they landed, in either the Pacific Northwest or Northern California. Contacts with a local indigenous population were established over the course of several weeks. While ashore, Drake claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as Nova Albion or New Albion. Various theories regarding the landing location of New Albion in the northern Pacific have been proposed, including those recognized by the United States National Historic Landmark and California Historical Landmarks at Point Reyes National Seashore.

By 1589, Ortelius was publishing the Maris Pacifici first ever Pacific map featuring on the west coast of North-America a first ever representation of two major coastline features: the mouth of the Columbia River identified as &quot;Rio Grande&quot; and the delta of the Fraser River labeled &quot;Baia de las isleas&quot;.

Juan de Fuca, a Greek captain sailing for the Crown of Spain, supposedly found the Strait of Juan de Fuca around 1592. The strait was named for him, but whether he discovered it or not has long been questioned. 

During the early 1740s, Imperial Russia sent the Danish-born Russian Vitus Bering to the region. By the late 18th century and into the mid-19th century, Russian settlers had established several posts and communities on the northwest Pacific coast, eventually reaching as far south as Fort Ross, California. The Russian River was named after this local presence and three ranch outposts located alongside.

In 1774, the viceroy of New Spain sent Spanish navigator Juan Pérez in the ship &quot;Santiago&quot; to the Pacific Northwest. Peréz made landfall on Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) on July 18, 1774. The northernmost latitude he reached was 54°40′ N. This was followed, in 1775, by another Spanish expedition, under the command of Bruno de Heceta and including Juan Peréz and Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra as officers. On July 14, 1775, they landed on the Olympic Peninsula near the mouth of the Quinault River. On August 17, 1775, Heceta, returning south, sighted the mouth of the Columbia River and named it &quot;Bahia de la Asunción&quot;. While Heceta sailed south, Quadra continued north in the expedition&#x27;s second ship, &quot;Sonora&quot;, reaching Alaska, at 59° N. In 1778 English mariner Captain James Cook visited Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island and also voyaged as far as Prince William Sound.

In 1779, a third Spanish expedition, under the command of Ignacio de Artega in the ship &quot;Princesa&quot;, and with Quadra as captain of the ship &quot;Favorite&quot;, sailed from Mexico to the coast of Alaska, reaching 61° N. Two further Spanish expeditions, in 1788 and 1789, both under Esteban Jose Martínez and Gonzalo López de Haro, sailed to the Pacific Northwest. During the second expedition, they met the American captain Robert Gray near Nootka Sound. Upon entering Nootka Sound, they found William Douglas and his ship &quot;Iphigenia&quot;. Conflict led to the Nootka Crisis, which was resolved by agreements known as the Nootka Convention. In 1790, the Spanish sent three ships to Nootka Sound, under the command of Francisco de Eliza. After establishing a base at Nootka, Eliza sent out several exploration parties. Salvador Fidalgo was sent north to the Alaska coast. Manuel Quimper, with Gonzalo López de Haro as pilot, explored the Strait of Juan de Fuca, discovering the San Juan Islands and Admiralty Inlet in the process. Francisco de Eliza himself took the ship &quot;San Carlos&quot; into the Strait of Juan de Fuca. From a base at Port Discovery, his &quot;pilotos&quot; (masters) José María Narváez and Juan Carrasco explored the San Juan Islands, Haro Strait, Rosario Strait, and Bellingham Bay. In the process, they discovered the Strait of Georgia and explored it as far north as Texada Island. The expedition returned to Nootka Sound by August 1791. Alessandro Malaspina, sailing for Spain, explored and mapped the coast from Yakutat Bay to Prince William Sound in 1791, then sailed to Nootka Sound. Performing a scientific expedition in the manner of James Cook, Malaspina&#x27;s scientists studied the Tlingit and Nuu-chah-nulth peoples before returning to Mexico. Another Spanish explorer, Jacinto Caamaño, sailed the ship &quot;Aranzazu&quot; to Nootka Sound in May 1792. There he met Quadra, who was in command of the Spanish settlement and Fort San Miguel. Quadra sent Caamaño north, to carefully explore the coast between Vancouver Island and Bucareli Bay, Alaska. Various Spanish maps, including Caamaño&#x27;s, were given to George Vancouver in 1792, as the Spanish and British worked together to chart the complex coastline.

From 1792 to 1794, George Vancouver charted the Pacific Northwest on behalf of Great Britain, including the Strait of Georgia, the bays and inlets of Puget Sound, and the Johnstone Strait–Queen Charlotte Strait and much of the rest of the British Columbia Coast and southeast Alaska shorelines. For him the city of Vancouver and Vancouver Island are named, as well as Vancouver, Washington. From Mexico, Malaspina dispatched the last Spanish exploration expedition in the Pacific Northwest, under Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayentano Valdes aboard the schooners &quot;Sutil&quot; and &quot;Mexicana&quot;. They met Vancouver in the Strait of Georgia on June 21, 1792. Vancouver had explored Puget Sound just previously. The Spanish explorers knew of Admiralty Inlet and the unexplored region to the south, but they decided to sail north. They discovered and entered the Fraser River shortly before meeting Vancouver. After sharing maps and agreeing to cooperate, Galiano, Valdés, and Vancouver sailed north to Desolation Sound and the Discovery Islands, charting the coastline together. They passed through Johnstone Strait and Cordero Channel and returned to Nootka Sound. As a result, the Spanish explorers, who had set out from Nootka, became the first Europeans to circumnavigate Vancouver Island. Vancouver himself had entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca directly without going to Nootka first, so had not sailed completely around the island.

In 1786, Jean-François de La Pérouse, representing France, sailed to Haida Gwaii after visiting Nootka Sound, but any possible French claims to this region were lost when La Pérouse and his men and journals were lost in a shipwreck near Australia. Upon encountering the Salish coastal tribes, either Pérouse or someone in his crew remarked, &quot;What must astonish most is to see painting everywhere, everywhere sculpture, among a nation of hunters&quot;. Maritime fur trader Charles William Barkley also visited the area in &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot;, a British ship falsely flying the flag of the Austrian Empire. American merchant sea-captain Robert Gray traded along the coast, and discovered the mouth of the Columbia River.

===Continental crossover exploration===
Explorer Alexander Mackenzie completed in 1793 the first continental crossing in what is called today central British Columbia and reached the Pacific Ocean. Simon Fraser explored and mapped the Fraser River from Central British Columbia down to its mouth in 1808. And mapmaker David Thompson explored in 1811 the entire route of the Columbia River from its northern headwaters all the way to its mouth. These explorations were commissioned by the North West Company and were all undertaken with small teams of Voyageurs.

United States President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark Expedition to travel through the Midwest starting from St. Louis, cross the Continental Divide and reach the Columbia River up to its mouth. Americans reached the Pacific Ocean &quot;overland&quot; in 1805. The Pacific Fur Company sent in 1811 an &quot;over-lander&quot; crew including a large contingent of Voyageurs to retrace most of the path of the earlier expedition up to the mouth of the Columbia and join the company ship. The &quot;Tonquin&quot; came oversea via Cape Horn to build and operate Fort Astoria.

These early land expeditions mapped the way for subsequent land explorations and building early settlements.

===Subsequent land explorations===

The Willamette River was the first PNW inland waterway to be explored north–south during trapping expeditions carried out throughout the 1810s by the Pacific Fur Company soon acquired by the North West Company (NWC). During the 1820s, the upper Willamette, the Umpqua, the Rogue, the Klamath were all reached still heading southward up toward the Sacramento River and California under the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) having now itself acquired the NWC. The Siskiyou Trail was gradually being established by Alexander Roderick McLeod and Peter Skene Ogden leading related expeditions for the HBC.
Also during the 1820s, HBC explorations were carried out northward originating from the Columbia River Fort Astoria long renamed to Fort George. Simon Plamondon first ventured during the early 20s into the Cowlitz River up to Cowlitz Prairie. By 1824, an expedition led by James McMillan was reaching Puget Sound via the Chehalis River (Washington) and a portage. The same expedition went on all the way to Boundary Bay and reached the Fraser River via the Nicomekl and the Salmon linked via a portage. The lower Fraser was revisited 16 years after explorer Simon Fraser (NWC) had first reached its mouth, although originating from northern present-day British Columbia. Puget Sound soon after would get reached via the Cowlitz and the Cowlitz Landing portage, but originating from new HBC headquarter Fort Vancouver located closer by, north of the Columbia.

===Early settlements===

Noteworthy Russian settlements still in place include: Unalaska (1774), Kodiak (1791), and Sitka (1804) making them the oldest permanent non-Indigenous settlements in the Pacific Northwest. Temporary Spanish settlement Santa Cruz de Nuca (1789–1795) held on a few years at Nootka Sound.

Other early occupation non-Indigenous settlements of interest, either long lasting or still in place, built and operated by either the North West Company, the Pacific Fur Company or the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company include: Fort Saint-James (1806; oldest in British Columbia west of the Rockies), Fort Astoria (1811; oldest in Oregon), Fort Nez Percés (1818), Fort Alexandria (1821), Fort Vancouver (1824), Fort Langley (1827; oldest in southern British Columbia), Fort Nisqually (1833), and Fort Victoria (1843).

Also of interest are the first mixed ancestry settlements sometimes referred as Métis settlements or French Canadian settlements. Native and newly arrived &quot;half-breeds&quot; (born out of &quot;Europeans&quot; and Indigenous alliances), local and newly arrived Indigenous people as well as &quot;French Canadians&quot; all issued of the fur trade were all able to peacefully coexist. Small scale farming occurred. Catholic missions and churches thrived for many years. These first settlements were: French Prairie, Frenchtown near Walla Walla, Cowlitz Prairie (Washington), French Settlement (Oregon) and Frenchtown near Missoula. Most mixed ancestry people ended up resettled in or around Indigenous reserves during the subsequent period, or otherwise assimilating in the mainstream.

===Boundary disputes===
Initial formal claims to the region were asserted by Spain in 1513 with explorer Nuñez de Balboa, the first European to sight the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. Russian maritime fur trade activity, through the Russian-American Company, extended from the farther side of the Pacific to &quot;Russian America&quot;. This prompted Spain to send expeditions north to assert Spanish ownership, while Captain James Cook and subsequent expeditions by George Vancouver advanced British claims. As of the Nootka Sound Conventions, the last in 1794, Spain gave up its exclusive a priori claims and agreed to share the region with the other powers, giving up its garrison at Nootka Sound in the process.

The United States established a claim based on the discoveries of Robert Gray, the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the construction of Fort Astoria, and the acquisition of Spanish claims given to the United States in the Adams–Onís Treaty. From the 1810s until the 1840s, modern-day Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and western Montana, along with most of British Columbia, were part of what the United States called the Oregon Country and Britain called the Columbia District. This region was jointly claimed by the United States and Great Britain after the Treaty of 1818, which established a co-dominion of interests in the region in lieu of a settlement. In 1840, American Charles Wilkes explored in the area. John McLoughlin, Chief Factor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, headquartered at Fort Vancouver, was the &quot;de facto&quot; local political authority for most of this time.

This arrangement ended as U.S. settlement grew and President James K. Polk was elected on a platform of calling for annexation of the entire Oregon Country and of Texas. After his election, supporters coined the famous slogan &quot;Fifty-four Forty or Fight&quot;, referring to 54°40′ north latitude—the northward limit of the United States&#x27; claim. After a war scare with the United Kingdom, the Oregon boundary dispute was settled in the 1846 Oregon Treaty, partitioning the region along the 49th parallel and resolving most, but not all, of the border disputes (see Pig War).

The mainland territory north of the 49th parallel remained unincorporated until 1858, when a mass influx of Americans and others during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush forced the hand of Colony of Vancouver Island&#x27;s Governor James Douglas, who declared the mainland a Crown colony. The two colonies were amalgamated in 1866 to cut costs, and joined the Dominion of Canada in 1871. The U.S. portion became the Oregon Territory in 1848. It was later subdivided into Oregon Territory and Washington Territory. These territories became the states of Oregon, Idaho, Washington and parts of other Western states.

During the American Civil War, British Columbia officials pushed for London to invade and conquer the Washington Territory in effort to take advantage of Americans being distracted in the war on the Eastern region. This was rejected, as the UK did not wish to risk war with the United States, whose forces were better prepared and trained much more than the British troops.

American expansionist pressure on British Columbia persisted after the colony became a province of Canada, even though Americans living in the province did not harbor annexationist inclinations. The Fenian Brotherhood openly organized and drilled in Washington, particularly in the 1870s and the 1880s, though no cross-border attacks were experienced. During the Alaska Boundary Dispute, U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt threatened to invade and annex British Columbia if Britain would not yield on the question of the Yukon ports. In more recent times, during the so-called &quot;Salmon War&quot; of the 1990s, Washington Senator Slade Gorton called for the U.S. Navy to &quot;force&quot; the Inside Passage, even though it is not an official international waterway. Disputes between British Columbia and Alaska over the Dixon Entrance of the Hecate Strait between Prince Rupert and Haida Gwaii have not been resolved.

==Geology==
The Northwest is still highly geologically active, with both active volcanoes and geologic faults.

The last known great earthquake in the northwest was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. The geological record reveals that &quot;great earthquakes&quot; (those with moment magnitude 8 or higher) occur in the Cascadia subduction zone about every 500 years on average, often accompanied by tsunamis. There is evidence of at least 13 events at intervals from about 300 to 900 years.

Active volcanoes in the region include Mount Garibaldi, Mount Baker, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Meager, Mount Jefferson, Mount Shasta, Lassen Peak and Glacier Peak.

==Geography==

The Pacific Northwest is a diverse geographic region, dominated by several mountain ranges, including the Coast Mountains, the Cascade Range, the Olympic Mountains, the Columbia Mountains, and the Rocky Mountains. The highest peak in the Pacific Northwest is Mount Rainier, in the Washington Cascades, at . Immediately inland from the Cascade Range are broad, generally dry plateaus. In the US, this region is known as the Columbia Plateau, while in British Columbia, it is the Interior Plateau, also called the Fraser Plateau. The Columbia Plateau was the scene of massive ice-age floods, and as a consequence, there are many coulees, canyons, and the Channeled Scablands. Much of the plateau, especially in eastern Washington, is irrigated farmland. The Columbia River cuts a deep and wide gorge around the rim of the Columbia Plateau and through the Cascade Range on its way to the Pacific Ocean.

Because many areas have plentiful rainfall and mild summers, the Pacific Northwest has some of North America&#x27;s most lush and extensive forests, which are extensively populated with Coast Douglas fir trees, the second tallest growing evergreen conifer on earth. The region also contains specimens of the tallest trees on earth, the coast redwoods, in southwestern Oregon, but the largest of these trees are located just south of the California border in northwestern California. Coastal forests in some areas are classified as temperate rainforest.

Coastal features are defined by the interaction with the Pacific and the North American continent. The coastline of the Pacific Northwest is dotted by numerous fjords, bays, islands, and mountains. Some of these features include the Oregon Coast, Burrard Inlet, Puget Sound, and the highly complex fjords of the British Columbia Coast and Southeast Alaska. The region has one of the world&#x27;s longest fjord coastlines.

The Pacific Northwest contains an uncountable number of islands, many of the smaller ones being unnamed. The vast majority of such islands are in British Columbia and Alaska. Vancouver Island is by far the largest island in the area, but other significant land masses include the Haida Gwaii, vast and remote Princess Royal Island, Prince of Wales Island and Chichagof Island. The Salish Sea located close to major populated areas contains smaller but more frequently visited and well known islands. These include Whidbey Island, Salt Spring Island, and Texada Island, along with dozens of smaller islands in the San Juan and Gulf Island chains.

The major cities of Vancouver, Portland, Seattle, and Tacoma all began as seaports supporting the logging, mining, and farming industries of the region, but have developed into major technological and industrial centers (such as the Silicon Forest), which benefit from their location on the Pacific Rim.

If defined as British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, the Pacific Northwest has four US National Parks: Crater Lake in Oregon, and Olympic, Mount Rainier, and North Cascades in Washington. If a larger regional definition is used, then other US National Parks might be included, such as Redwood National and State Parks, Glacier Bay National Park, Wrangell–St. Elias National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and parts of Glacier National Park and Yellowstone National Park. There are several Canadian National Parks in the Pacific Northwest, including Pacific Rim National Park on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Mount Revelstoke National Park and Glacier National Park in the Selkirk Range alongside Rogers Pass, Kootenay National Park and Yoho National Park on the British Columbia flank of the Rockies, Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve in Haida Gwaii, and the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve in the Strait of Georgia. There are numerous protected areas in British Columbia and in the United States.

Other outstanding natural features include the Columbia River Gorge, Fraser Canyon, Mount St. Helens, Malaspina Glacier, and Hells Canyon. The south-central Coast Mountains in British Columbia contain the five largest mid-latitude icefields in the world.

===Climate===
The main general climatic types of the Pacific Northwest are temperate; cool temperatures and frequent cloudy skies are typical. Under the Köppen climate classification, a warm-summer Mediterranean (&quot;Csb&quot;) designation is assigned to many areas of the Pacific Northwest as far north as central Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, including cities such as Victoria, Vancouver (coast area), Seattle, and Portland. Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha, place these areas in the oceanic zone (&quot;Do&quot;). An Alpine climate dominates in the high mountains. Semi-arid and arid climates are found east of the higher mountains, especially in rainshadow areas. The Harney Basin of Oregon is an example of arid climate in the Pacific Northwest. Humid continental climates occur inland on windward sides, in places such as Revelstoke, British Columbia. A subarctic climate can be found farther north, especially in Yukon and Alaska.

The lack of rain in the hot season is associated with high atmospheric pressure. The shadows of the mountains also greatly decrease the amount of precipitation. West of the Cascades, the marine climates have a much greater precipitation than the west coast of Europe due to orographic lift, with some regions seeing as much as 3,500 mm (138 in) of precipitation per year. Winters are very mild for the region&#x27;s latitude. The growth of &quot;Arbutus&quot;, an evergreen broad-leafed tree, is possible on Vancouver Island due to the mild winters.

====The Big Dark====

The Big Dark is a term for winter in the Pacific Northwest. At a latitude of almost 48 degrees north, Seattle has sunsets before 6 PM between October and March, and fewer than nine hours of daylight for many weeks around the winter solstice. The darkness contributes to seasonal affective disorder among people living in northern cities, including those in the Puget Sound region. The darkness is enhanced by a return from dry summers to extremely cloudy and wet weather characterized by recurring atmospheric rivers and Pacific Northwest windstorms.

===Ecoregions===

Much of the Pacific Northwest is forested. The Georgia Strait–Puget Sound basin is shared between western British Columbia and Washington, and the Pacific temperate rain forests ecoregion, which is the largest of the world&#x27;s temperate rain forest ecoregions in the system created by the World Wildlife Fund, stretches along the coast from Alaska to California. The dry desert inland from the Cascade Range and Coast Mountains is very different from the terrain and climate of the coastal area due to the rain shadow effect of the mountains, and comprises the Columbia, Fraser and Thompson Plateaus and mountain ranges contained within them. The interior regions&#x27; climates largely within Eastern Washington, south central British Columbia, Eastern Oregon, and southern Idaho are a part of the Great Basin Desert, although by their northern and eastern reaches, dry land and desert areas verge at the end of the Cascades&#x27; and Coast Mountains&#x27; rain shadows with the boreal forest and various alpine flora regimes characteristic of eastern British Columbia, the Idaho Panhandle and western Montana roughly along a longitudinal line defined by the Idaho border with Washington and Oregon. The North American inland temperate rainforest is in the so-called interior wet-belt, approximately 500–700 km inland from the Pacific coast on western, windward mountain slopes and valley bottoms of the Columbia Mountains and the Rocky Mountains. The interior wet-belt refers to a discontinuous band of humid forest patches, that are scattered over 1000 km between Purden Lake in Canada&#x27;s British Columbia (54° North) and Montana and Idaho&#x27;s Bitterroot Mountains and Idaho&#x27;s Salmon River Mountains (45° North). It is closely associated with the North Central Rockies forests ecoregion designated by the WWF, which extends over a similar range but incorporates various non-temperate rainforest ecosystems.

==Demographics==
===Population===
The overwhelming majority of the population of the Pacific Northwest is concentrated in the Portland–Seattle–Vancouver corridor. As of 2016, the combined populations of the Lower Mainland region (which includes the Metro Vancouver Regional District), the Seattle metropolitan area, and the Portland metropolitan area totaled more than nine million people. However, beyond these three cities, the PNW region is characterized by a very low density population distribution. Some other regions of greater population density outside this corridor include the Greater Victoria area and Greater Nanaimo area on Southern Vancouver Island (with a population of approximately 530,000), the Okanagan Valley in the British Columbia interior (about 350,000 people centered around the city of Kelowna, which has close to 200,000 people). Large geographical areas may only have one mid-sized to small-sized city as a regional center (often a county seat), with smaller cities and towns scattered around. Vast areas of the region may have little or no population at all, largely due to the presence of extensive mountains and forests, and plateaus containing both extensive farm and range lands, much of which is protected from development in large parks and preserves, or by zoning use regulation related to traditional land use. For example, all cities within the portion of California which are sometimes included some definitions of the &quot;Pacific Northwest&quot; have populations less than 100,000, with that portion of the state containing millions of acres of national forests and parks.

===Ethnicity===

In British Columbia, Europeans form 64% of the population with Asians comprising a further 29% of the provincial population. Both the Asian and European populations of the province are diverse; of the Asian population, 15% of the population is of East Asian descent, 8% of the population is of South Asian descent, with smaller numbers of Southeast Asians (4%) and West Asians (2%); the European population contains large communities of English Canadians, Scottish Canadians, Irish Canadians, French Canadians, German Canadians, and many others. Europeans form between 80 and 90 per cent of the population in U.S. section of the Pacific Northwest, thus the Asian presence is comparably smaller, with all Asian groups together comprising about 8% of Washington state&#x27;s population, and less than 4% in Oregon and Idaho. This is due to immigration quotas at the federal level, as while Canada has one-tenth the population of the United States, it takes in one-quarter as many immigrants, many of whom are from Asia. Vancouver settled about a quarter of all emigrants from Hong Kong to Canada in the late 1980s.

In the U.S. side of the region, Latinos make up a large portion of the agricultural labor force east of the Cascade Range, and are an increasing presence in the general labor force west of the Cascades. Despite the Second Great Migration from the 1940s to 1960s due to the booming Boeing war industry and post-war growing economy, African Americans are less numerous in the Pacific Northwest; however, the overall African American population has been growing in other smaller urban areas throughout the region such as Eugene. African Americans tend to concentrate in western urban areas such as Tacoma, south Seattle, and Portland. Nonetheless, Black people have a very large presence in Tacoma&#x27;s Hilltop and South Tacoma neighborhoods, Seattle&#x27;s Central District and Rainier Valley neighborhoods, and in Portland&#x27;s Northeast Quadrant. There are growing numbers in Vancouver as well, particularly Africans, Jamaicans and Black people from the United States.

Beginning in the late 20th century, a general suburbanization of East and South Asian communities occurred in Vancouver, prompting concerns regarding the preservation of historical inner-city communities particularly in Chinatown and Punjabi Market.

African Americans have held the positions of Mayor in Seattle; King County executive, while the state of Washington elected a Chinese American governor during the 1990s, Gary Locke.

British Columbians of many ethnicities are prominent in all levels of politics and government, and the province has a number of &quot;firsts&quot; in Canadian political history, including the first non-white and Asian Premier, Ujjal Dosanjh (who is Indo-Canadian) and the first Asian Lieutenant-Governor, the Hon. David Lam. The Lieutenant-Governor from 2007 to 2012, Steven Point, was of aboriginal origin, being Stó:lō (the dominant type of Coast Salish in BC&#x27;s Lower Mainland) from the Chilliwack area. The leader of the opposition party from 2005 to 2011, the NDP, was Carole James, of partial Métis origin. Colonial governor James Douglas was himself mulatto of Guyanese extraction and his wife was of Cree origin.

Oregon has been a national leader concerning LGBT representation in government. At the time of his election to the office of Portland mayor in 2008, Sam Adams was the first openly gay individual to represent a city of Portland&#x27;s size in the United States. In Silverton, Oregon, the same year, Stu Rasmussen was elected the first transgender mayor in U.S. history. The first two LGBT state supreme court justices in the country both sit on the Oregon Supreme Court. At the time of her election, the previous Governor of Oregon Kate Brown was the highest-ranking openly bisexual politician in the United States. The current governor is Tina Kotek, who became one of the first two openly lesbian women elected governor of a U.S. state after her election in 2022. In 2017, Jenny Durkan was elected as the first openly lesbian mayor of Seattle.

===Language===
Most Americans and Canadians consider the Pacific Northwest English accent &quot;neutral&quot;, though distinct from the Midwestern dialects that some believe typify American speech. It possess the low back vowel merger, or the cot–caught merger. Canadian raising occurs in British Columbia and some speakers in Washington to a similar degree as it does in southern Ontario, but weaker than other parts of Canada. The California Vowel Shift also affects speech in the region.

Chinook Jargon was a pidgin or trade language established among indigenous inhabitants of the region. After contact with Europeans, French, English, and Cree words entered the language, and &quot;eventually, Chinook became the lingua franca for as many as 250,000 people along the Pacific Slope from Alaska to Oregon&quot;. Chinook Jargon reached its height of usage in the 19th century, though remained common in resource and wilderness areas, particularly, but not exclusively, by Native Americans and Canadian First Nations people, well into the 20th century. Today, its influence is felt mostly in place names and a handful of localized slang terms, particularly the word &quot;skookum&quot;, which remains hallmark of people raised in the region.

French was the voyageurs&#x27; working language of the early continental crossover exploration crews. The ensuing fur trade was dominated by French Canadian (and Métis) workers. The language held on South of the border in a few early settlements such as French Prairie, Frenchtown (Washington), Frenchtown (Montana), Cowlitz Prairie, and French Settlement. These early settlements got resupplied through waves of new arrivals from the Oregon Trail attracted by the language and Catholics communities. Much of it ended up assimilating to the melting pot or sometimes folding into reservations. New waves of French speaking workers came in later on to work in forestry and wood mills such as Maillardville in the greater Vancouver area. French remains much used in place names, in the documentation of products intended for North America (along with Spanish and English), as well as an official language in Canada. French schooling is also popular in Western Canada, including British Columbia.

Besides English and indigenous languages, Chinese has been common since the gold rushes of the mid-19th century, most particularly in British Columbia. Since the 1980s the Toishan, a Yue dialect predominant in the area, has been replaced by mainstream Cantonese and by Mandarin because of large-scale immigration from Asia. Punjabi is also common in British Columbia, specifically in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley owing to the large Punjabi Sikh population in the region, first arriving in the late 19th century. Spanish is also spoken in parts of Oregon and Washington as well as British Columbia by Mexicans and other Hispanics, both recent immigrants and long-standing communities.

===Spirituality and religion===

The Pacific Northwest has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism; this is most pronounced on the part of the region west of the Cascades. A recent study indicates that one quarter of those in Washington and Oregon have no religion. Similarly, according to the 2011 National Household Survey, 44% of British Columbia residents reported no religion.

Religion plays a smaller part in Pacific Northwest politics than in the rest of the United States. The religious right has considerably less political influence than in other regions. Political conservatives in the Pacific Northwest tend to identify more strongly with free-market libertarian values than they do with more religious social conservatives.

That said, three of the four major international charities in the region are religious in nature: World Concern, World Vision International, and Mercy Corps. This is part of a long tradition of activist religion. The Skid Road Group, a shelter offering soup and sermons to the unemployed and recovering alcoholics, was launched in Vancouver, with the Salvation Army having deep roots in the Gastown district, dating back to the era of the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1880s) and attained prominence in the same centers during the Klondike Gold Rush.

The region is also known as a magnet for a wide range of philosophical and spiritual belief systems. Eastern spiritual beliefs have been adopted by an unusually large number of people (by North American standards), and Tibetan Buddhism in particular has a strong local following. The Northwest Tibetan Cultural Association, claimed to be the largest organization of its kind in the world, was founded in Portland in 1993.

The region is home to many unique Christian communities, ranging from the Doukhobors to the Mennonites. The Mennonite Central Committee Supportive Care Services is based in the British Columbia city of Abbotsford. The Mennonite Central Committee and the Mennonite Disaster Service enjoy a heavy rate of enlistment and donations from the strong Mennonite community in British Columbia&#x27;s Fraser Valley. The Doukhobors, whose church is the Union of Spiritual Communities of Christ, are a Russian Anabaptist sect whose migration to Canada was aided by Count Leo Tolstoy, and who are today focused in the West Kootenay and Boundary regions of Southeastern British Columbia. Their history in Canada includes resistance to state education and industrial development (see Sons of Freedom). Also, within the region, there is a fairly strong representation of Orthodox churches (Greek, Russian, Serbian, and others), as well as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley has a large population of Russian Old Believers. Religious sees that are based in the Pacific Northwest include the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical provinces of Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver, Province 8 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Anglican Ecclesiastical Province of British Columbia and Yukon, and the suffragan dioceses that make up those provinces.

Yogic teachings, Sufism, tribal and ancient beliefs and other philosophies are widely studied and appreciated in the region. The Lower Mainland of British Columbia has a very large Sikh community. Oregon has a considerable Quaker (Society of Friends) population. There has been major growth in Chinese Buddhist temples since the increase in immigration from East Asia in the 1980s, especially in Vancouver.

Also in Vancouver, there is a small Hindu population, a number of Parsee (Zoroastrians), and an emerging Muslim, especially the 11,000-strong Ismaili, population from South Asia, the Middle East, Africa, the Balkans, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere.

Two of the five Shingon Buddhist temples in America are in Seattle.

Some people in the area also embrace alternative religion, such as New Age spirituality and Neo-Paganism. A New Thought church called Living Enrichment Center with 4,000 members was in Wilsonville, Oregon, from 1992 to 2004.
* Brother Twelve ran a controversial commune in the Gulf Islands of British Columbia early in the 20th century.
* The Emissaries of Divine Light are a notable presence in the region of 100 Mile House, British Columbia and also have a large ashram on Kootenay Lake, northeast of Nelson, British Columbia.
* The followers of the Guru Rajneesh, the &quot;sannyasins&quot;, established a center for their beliefs and lifestyle near Antelope, Oregon, which included an ashram complex as well as, for a while, an attempted takeover of the local economy.
* The training school of the immortal (according to the organization) being Ramtha is headquartered in Yelm, Washington.
* Eckhart Tolle, author of &quot;The Power of Now&quot;, lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.
* Neale Donald Walsch, author of &quot;Conversations with God&quot;, lives in Ashland, Oregon, where he runs a retreat center.

==Politics==
A major divide in political opinion separates the region&#x27;s greatly more populated urban core and rural areas west of the mountains from its less populated rural areas to their east and (in British Columbia and Alaska) north. The coastal areas—especially in the cities of Vancouver, Victoria, Bellingham, Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Portland, and Eugene—are some of the most politically liberal parts of North America, regularly supporting left-wing political candidates and causes by significant majorities. The religious right has much less influence throughout the region than elsewhere in the U.S. or in Western Canada. Certain areas of the British Columbia Interior, particularly the West Kootenay, and some areas of Vancouver Island and the B.C. Coast, have long histories of labour, environmental, and social activism.

The jurisdictions have relatively liberal abortion laws, gender equality laws, legal cannabis, and strong LGBT rights, especially British Columbia where these issues are of federal jurisdiction, and where same-sex marriage has been legal since 2003, Washington, where it has been legal since 2012, and Oregon, where same-sex marriage was made legal in May 2014. Oregon was the first U.S. state to legalize physician-assisted suicide, with the Death with Dignity Act of 1994. Washington State was the second when I-1000 passed in 2008. Colegio Cesar Chavez, the first fully accredited Hispanic college in the U.S., was founded in Mount Angel, Oregon, in 1973. In 1986, King County, Washington, which contains Seattle, voted to change its namesake from William R. King to Martin Luther King Jr.

These areas, especially around Puget Sound, have a long history of political radicalism. The radical labor organizers called Wobblies were particularly strong there in the mines, lumber camps and shipyards. A number of anarchist communes sprang up there in the early 20th century (see Charles Pierce LeWarne&#x27;s &quot;Utopias on Puget Sound, 1885–1915&quot; for an overview of this movement). There are also pro gun socialist organizations such as Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club. Seattle is one of a handful of major cities in North America in which the populace engaged in a general strike (in 1919), and was the first major American city to elect a woman mayor, Bertha Knight Landes (in 1926). Socialist beliefs were once widespread (thanks in large part to the area&#x27;s large numbers of Scandinavian immigrants), and the region has had a number of Socialist elected officials. So great was its influence that the U.S. Postmaster General, James Farley, jokingly toasted the &quot;forty-seven states of the Union, and the Soviet of Washington&quot;, at a gala dinner in 1936 (although Farley denied ever saying it).

Due to the Pacific Northwest being a generally liberal region, it also has a long history of feminism and people with feminist ideologies. The journey on the Oregon Trail may have been the part of the cause of feminism in the region, many women on the trail had to break gender-normative roles. Women occasionally were allowed the chance to try new things like cracking the whip for the wagon, given these opportunities women began to question their roles in society. Early days in the west, no forms of government had been established and this may have been part of the cause of feminist ideologies, new laws were formed to fit the regions needs and women were granted rights to land ownership in the West much earlier than in the East because of high death rates of men in the region. While this may be coincidental, this granted women power. Women&#x27;s suffrage movements were prominent in the Pacific Northwest; Susan B. Anthony did a tour through the region attempting to spread her ideas and made stops in Portland, the Willamette Valley, Columbia River, and Victoria. Not only were women&#x27;s suffrage movements prominent in the Pacific Northwest, but there was also a fight for women to keep their jobs after men returned from war in World War I. A group titled the Washington State Women&#x27;s Council (founded in 1963) fought for women&#x27;s policies, this group worked towards the states&#x27; equal rights amendment, and fought for women&#x27;s property rights in marriage during the 1972 legislative session.

The region also has a long history of starting cooperative and communal businesses and organizations, including Group Health, REI, MEC, Puget Consumers Co-op, and numerous granges and mutual aid societies. It also has a long history of publicly owned power and utilities, with many of the region&#x27;s cities owning their own public utilities. In British Columbia, credit unions are common and popular cooperatively owned financial institutions.

East of the Cascades, in Eastern Washington and Eastern Oregon, the population is much more conservative. The eastern portions of Washington and especially Oregon, due to their low populations, do not generally have enough voting power to be competitive at the state level, and thus the governorships and U.S. Senate seats of both Oregon and Washington are usually held by the Democrats. Conservatism in the eastern part of the Pacific Northwest tends to be distrustful of federal government interference in the market.

Aluminum smelting was once an important part of the region&#x27;s economy due to the abundance of cheap hydroelectric power. Hydroelectric power generated by the hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River powered at least ten aluminum smelters during the mid-20th century. By the end of World War II these smelters were producing over a third of the United States&#x27; aluminum. Production rose during the 1950s and 1960s, then declined. By the first decade of the 21st century the aluminum industry in the Pacific Northwest was essentially defunct. The Alcan smelter at Kitimat continues in operation and is fed by the diversion of the Nechako River (a tributary of the Fraser) to a powerhouse on the coast at Kemano, near Kitimat.

The region as a whole, but especially several specific areas, are concentrated high-tech areas: Seattle eastern suburbs, the Portland Silicon Forest area, and Vancouver, British Columbia. These areas are also leading &quot;creative class&quot; economic drivers, feeding thriving cultural sectors, and include many knowledge workers and numerous international advertising, media, and design firms.

==Culture==

Although the dominant culture in the Pacific Northwest today is Anglo-American, Anglo-Canadian, and Scandinavian American, there is significant Mexican and Chinese influence. 23% of Vancouver, British Columbia, is Chinese, and 50% of residents of the City of Vancouver do not speak English as their first language. Parts of Oregon and Washington are bilingual in both English and Spanish, and Native American culture is strong throughout the Pacific Northwest. The hippie movement also began in California and the Pacific Northwest. There have been proposals for certain parts of the Pacific Northwest becoming its own country because of the shared ecoregion and culture, the most well-known being Cascadia. However, the region is strongly divided by the international border, and this division grew more rather than less powerful over the 20th century. Carl Abbott argues that, given the twin factors of limited economic integration vis-a-vis NAFTA, and cultural similarities, he views the major cities as &quot;going their separate ways&quot; as east–west gateways of commerce, competing with each other, rather than forming north–south connectors of a tentative &quot;mega-region&quot;.

Cannabis use is relatively popular, especially around Vancouver, Victoria, Bellingham, Seattle, Olympia, Portland, and Eugene. Several of these jurisdictions have made arrests for cannabis a low enforcement priority. Medical marijuana is legal in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon, as well as in Alaska, which has legalised cannabis and has many licensed dispensaries, and in Yukon, although less than 50 of the territory&#x27;s residents are licensed to use medical marijuana, and no legal dispensaries operate within its borders. As of December 6, 2012, possession of less than an ounce of marijuana for recreational use by persons over 21 years of age became legal in Washington state as a result of state ballot measure Initiative 502, which was approved by the state&#x27;s voters on November 6, 2012, by a ten-point margin. As of July 1, 2015, recreational marijuana use was legalized in Oregon as well.

===Environmentalism===
Environmentalism is prominent throughout the region, especially west of the Cascades. Environmentally conscious services such as recycling and public transportation are widespread, most notably in the more populous areas. Politically, the Pacific Northwest is actively involved in environmental efforts. The international organization Greenpeace was born in Vancouver in 1970 as part of a large public opposition movement in British Columbia to US nuclear weapons testing on Amchitka Island in the Aleutian Islands. Liberal and conservative Northwesterners, such as former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) and moderate Democrats like former Speaker of the House Tom Foley (D-WA), have been prominent in the development of conservative approaches to environmental protection. Seattle in particular is also home to a large number of publications and institutions concerned with the environment and sustainability, including both &quot;Worldchanging&quot; and &quot;Grist.org&quot;, the U.S.&#x27;s two largest online green magazines. The Pacific Northwest is also noted for a large number of gardening clubs, with Victoria having an annual flower count in February.

The direct-intervention oceanic protection group known as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has its headquarters in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island.

In British Columbia, environmentalists fought to protect Clayoquot Sound in the 1980s and 1990s. More recently the province has agreed to environmental protections in the Great Bear Rainforest.

===Music===

The modern-era Pacific Northwest is known for indie music, especially grunge, alternative rock, and metal; the region also has folk music and world music traditions and has lately gained notice for its hip hop scene. Many acts are associated with the independent label Sub Pop. KEXP.org is a popular Seattle-based public indie music radio station known across the country. Among the Northwest&#x27;s largest music festivals are the Merritt Mountain Music Festival, the Vancouver Folk Music Festival, the Sasquatch! Music Festival in George, Washington, Seattle&#x27;s Bumbershoot, Boise&#x27;s Treefort Music Fest, and Portland&#x27;s MusicfestNW. Portland&#x27;s Waterfront Blues Festival is the largest blues-based festival west of the Mississippi River.

Among the most notable rock artists originating from the region are Jimi Hendrix, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Foo Fighters, the Decemberists, and Sleater-Kinney. The history of Northwest rock, however, finds its roots in the mid-1950s and 1960s with such bands as the Sonics, the Ventures, the Kingsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders.

===Cuisine===

Foods typical of the Pacific Northwest include wild salmon, halibut, shellfish, huckleberries, marionberries, a wide variety of Asian cuisines, and locally produced fruits, vegetables, and cheeses.

Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, Italian, Mexican, and Greek cuisines are prevalent throughout the Northwest, and reflect the historically strong presence of those communities in the restaurant industry there. Teriyaki restaurants are particularly common in the Seattle area. Eateries featuring West Asian (predominantly Persian), East Asian fusion, and South Asian (predominantly Punjabi) cuisines are common throughout in Greater Vancouver, as are ethnic specialty restaurants of all kinds. Ethnic staples ranging from frozen pierogi or samosas to frozen spring rolls or dim sum are common in most supermarkets in these communities.

Locally-made craft beers, ciders, and premium wines from various wine-growing areas within the region are popular with drinkers and diners. Northern latitude and coastal breezes create a climate that attracts international recognition for its mostly family-owned and operated vineyards and wineries.

The region&#x27;s three USSF Division 1 Major League Soccer teams the Whitecaps FC, Sounders FC, and Timbers play to sold-out crowds and compete annually for the Cascadia Cup. The USSF Division 4 USL Premier Development League also has seven teams in the Northwest Division. In addition to all this, the region has its own representative non-FIFA team which joined the N.F.-Board officially in 2013 to participate in friendlies and the VIVA World Cup.

In 2018, the Cascadia Association Football Federation competed in the 2018 ConIFA World Football Cup representing the Pacific Northwest.

Vancouver is home to a 4-team league for Australian football, the British Columbia Australian Football League, one of several Canadian Australian football leagues.

Hockey is the most popular spectator sport in British Columbia, with the Vancouver Canucks of the NHL being the most popular professional team, although the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League also have a very strong following. The Canadian Football League&#x27;s BC Lions are considered Vancouver&#x27;s second most popular team, although major league soccer&#x27;s Vancouver Whitecaps FC have been rising in popularity in recent years. Hockey is slowly gaining popularity south of the border too, with the Everett Silvertips, Portland Winterhawks, and Seattle Thunderbirds of the Western Hockey League and the Seattle Kraken of the NHL.

Followers of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team refer to themselves as the &quot;Sixth Man&quot; and &quot;Blazermania&quot; refers to the extraordinary dedication fans have shown the team. In Seattle, many fans are still upset over the move of the Seattle SuperSonics while supporters of the Seattle Seahawks football team are known officially as the 12th Man. And the supporter groups, (namely the Emerald City Supporters, Timbers Army, and Vancouver Southsiders) of the three MLS teams of the region are renowned for their passion and dedication to their teams.

The only major track for motorsports in the Pacific Northwest region is Portland International Raceway. PIR currently hosts the NTT IndyCar Series and its Road to Indy ladder series&#x27;, as well as the NASCAR Xfinity Series; the number two stock car series in the country. Evergreen Speedway, north and east of Seattle, is the largest short track west of the Mississippi River and has hosted many of the marquee drivers of NASCAR. With three oval tracks, a figure eight track and various road course variants, Evergreen Speedway operates year-round events. Evergreen Speedway hosts the NASCAR Whelen All American Series, the ARCA Menards Series West, National Figure Eight Events, USAC, SCCA, plus Touring Groups and Formula Drift. The Northwest&#x27;s most successful racers on a national platform include 1983 Indianapolis 500 winner Tom Sneva (Spokane), Greg Moore (Maple Ridge, BC), Greg Biffle, (Vancouver, WA), Kasey Kahne (Enumclaw, WA), and 1990 Daytona 500 winner Derrike Cope (Spanaway, WA). Also, Mike Bliss (Milwaukee, OR), Chuck Bown (Portland), and Chad Little (Spokane) have won NASCAR-sanctioned championships, and had lengthy careers in NASCAR&#x27;s 3 national series.

In Idaho, Washington and Oregon, many residents passionately follow college athletics. In Washington, the major NCAA Division I college athletic programs are the University of Washington Huskies. In Oregon, the major programs are the University of Oregon Ducks and the Oregon State Beavers. All four of these programs are members of the Pac-12 Conference and compete with each other in a variety of sports. These universities are all considered rivals of one another, particularly in college football. The most significant of these rivalries are the Oregon–Washington football rivalry game, the Washington-Washington State game known as the Apple Cup due to Washington&#x27;s notoriety for apple production and the Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry. As in professional sports, college fans in the Pacific Northwest are known for being particularly passionate about their teams. Both Husky Stadium (where the Washington Huskies play football) and Autzen Stadium (where the Oregon Ducks play football) have gained reputations for deafening noise, despite not being the largest of college football venues. Husky Stadium currently holds the record for the loudest crowd noise in NCAA history at 130 decibels, while Autzen Stadium currently holds the record for the 4th at 127 decibels. In Idaho, the major NCAA Division I college athletic programs are the Boise State Broncos, the Idaho Vandals and the Idaho State Bengals, the latter two being members of the Football Championship Subdivision in the Big Sky Conference while Boise State competes in the Mountain West Conference of the Football Bowl Subdivision. Boise State and Idaho enjoyed a healthy rivalry from the 1970s through the late 2000s with each team having significant win streaks in the series over the other, Boise State had the most recent streak with 12 consecutive wins starting in 1999 which was preceded by Idaho&#x27;s most recent win streak of 12 consecutive wins from 1982 to 1993. In 2018, Idaho rekindled an old rivalry with Idaho State that had been dormant since 1996 when Idaho moved up to FBS. Idaho currently has the lead in the Battle of the Domes series 29–13.

===Video games===
Seattle is considered by &quot;Digital Trends&quot; magazine to be the top gaming city in America, a possible indicator of markedly higher rates of video game usage throughout the Pacific Northwest in general. A number of major companies are headquartered in the Seattle metropolitan area, including Microsoft, Valve, Bungie, Nintendo of America (a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo), and Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s subsidiary Sucker Punch Productions. Microsoft and Nintendo of America also have Canadian branches headquartered in Vancouver—Microsoft Canada and Nintendo of Canada—respectively, while EA Vancouver (a subsidiary division of Electronic Arts) is in the same city.

===Self-determination movements===
Among the fiercely independent and frontier nature of the former Oregon Country and now western part of the United States, is the desire of some Pacific Northwesterners to improve upon their form of democracy by further subdividing the region into socio-political or bioregion defined nation states. Some desires are transnational and autonomous of the United States while others are in the hope of gaining additional representational control in particular regions of the Northwest. Among these fluidly changing geographical boundaries and areas sought by a segment of the population of the Northwest are the following Pacific Northwest proposed states and separatist movements:

*Cascadia
*Jefferson
*Lincoln
*Northwest Territory

==Transportation==
A 2007 statistical analysis ranked the 50 Greenest Cities in the United States, placing Portland, Oregon first, Eugene, Oregon, fifth, and Seattle, Washington, eighth. The region as a whole is also known for its bicycle culture as an alternative form of transportation; Portland is considered by Forbes Traveler to be the second most bicycle-friendly city in the world. Portland is also the hub of American bicycle manufacturing; as a whole it generated over $68 million in revenue in 2007.

===Transit===
Seattle, Washington has also garnered a reputation for its contributions to public transportation with the Puget Sound Transit system, including an underground light rail system and a 38.9% worker commute rate as of 2011. Mass transit in Portland Metropolitan area is provided by TriMet and in Vancouver by TransLink (British Columbia).

Some tribal governments offer free bus service on their respective reservations, including on the Muckleshoot, Spokane, Umatilla and Yakama Indian Reservations.

<doc id="78151" wikidata="Q207703" url="?curid=78151" title="Rodeo">
<text>Rodeo () is a competitive equestrian sport that arose out of the working practices of cattle herding in Spain and Mexico, expanding throughout the Americas and to other nations. It was originally based on the skills required of the working vaqueros and later, cowboys, in what today is the western United States, western Canada, and northern Mexico. Today, it is a sporting event that involves horses and other livestock, designed to test the skill and speed of the cowboys and cowgirls.
Professional rodeos generally comprise the following events: tie-down roping, team roping, steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, bull riding, breakaway roping, and barrel racing. The events are divided into two basic categories: the timed events and rough stock events. Depending on sanctioning organization and region, other events such as goat tying and pole bending may also be a part of some rodeos. The &quot;world&#x27;s first public cowboy contest&quot; was held on July 4, 1883, in Pecos, Texas, between cattle driver Trav Windham and roper Morg Livingston.

Rodeo, particularly popular today throughout the western United States and in the Canadian province of Alberta, is the official state sport of Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas. The iconic silhouette image of a &quot;Bucking Horse and Rider&quot; is a federal and state-registered trademark of Wyoming. The Legislative Assembly of Alberta has considered making rodeo the official sport of that province. However, enabling legislation has yet to be passed.

In the United States, professional rodeos are governed and sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) and Women&#x27;s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA), while other associations govern assorted children&#x27;s, high school, collegiate, and other amateur or semi-professional rodeos. Associations also exist for Native Americans and other minority groups. The traditional season for competitive rodeo runs from spring through fall, while the modern professional rodeo circuit runs longer, and concludes with the PRCA National Finals Rodeo (NFR) in Las Vegas, held every December.

Rodeo has provoked opposition from animal rights and some animal welfare advocates, who argue that various competitions constitute animal cruelty. The rodeo industry has made progress in improving the welfare of rodeo animals, with specific requirements for veterinary care and other regulations that protect rodeo animals. However, some local and state governments in North America have banned or restricted rodeos, certain rodeo events, or types of equipment. Internationally, rodeo is banned in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, with other European nations placing restrictions on certain practices.

==Etymology==
The American English word &quot;rodeo&quot; is taken directly from Spanish (), which roughly translates into English as &#x27;round up&#x27;. The Spanish word is derived from the verb &quot;,&quot; meaning &#x27;to surround&#x27; or &#x27;go around&#x27;, used to refer to &quot;a pen for cattle at a fair or market,&quot; derived from the Latin or &quot;,&quot; meaning &#x27;to rotate or go around&#x27;.

In Spanish America, the &quot;rodeo&quot; was the process that was used by vaqueros to gather cattle for various purposes, such as moving them to new pastures, separating the cattle owned by different ranchers, or gathering in preparation for slaughter (). The yearly rodeos for separating the cattle were overseen by the &quot;Juez del Campo&quot;, who decided all questions of ownership. The term was also used to refer to exhibitions of skills used in the working &quot;rodeo&quot; and it evolved from these yearly gatherings where festivities were held, and horsemen could demonstrate their equestrian skills. This latter usage was adopted into the cowboy tradition of the United States and Canada.

The term &quot;rodeo&quot; was first used in English in approximately 1834 to refer to a cattle round-up. Today, the word is used primarily to refer to a public exhibition of cowboy skills, usually in the form of a competitive event.

==History==

Many rodeo events were based on the tasks required by cattle ranching. The working cowboy developed skills to fit the needs of the terrain and climate of the American west, and there were many regional variations. The skills required to manage cattle and horses date back to the Spanish traditions of the &quot;vaquero.&quot;

Early rodeo-like affairs of the 1820s and 1830s were informal events in the western United States and northern Mexico with cowboys and vaqueros testing their work skills against one another. After the American Civil War, rodeo competitions emerged, with the first held in Deer Trail, Colorado, in 1869. Prescott, Arizona north of Phoenix claimed the distinction of holding the first professional rodeo, as it charged admission and awarded trophies in 1888. Between 1890 and 1910, rodeos became public entertainment; sometimes combined Wild West shows featuring individuals such as Buffalo Bill Cody, Annie Oakley, and other charismatic stars. By 1910, several major rodeos were established in western North America including the Calgary Stampede in Calgary, Alberta; the Pendleton Round-Up in northeastern Oregon, and the Cheyenne Frontier Days in Cheyenne, Wyoming. 

On July 4, 1883, in the frontier town of Pecos an argument between Trav Windham, a cattle driver, and Morg Livingston, an accomplished cattle roper, led to what the &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot; refers to as the &quot;world&#x27;s first public cowboy contest&quot; and is often referred to as the first official rodeo. The two men chose to have the competition on the flatland on west side of the Pecos River. The July 4th public holiday allowed ranchers, cowboys and townsfolk to attend. Many other ranchers and cowboys chose to take part in the event including Jim Mannin, John Chalk, and Brawley Oates, many whom traveled from distant ranches. Windham would end up winning the roping contest. Other winners include Pete Beard of Hashknife Ranch and Jeff Chism. Prize money was $40 and blue ribbons donated by a young resident.

Rodeo-type events also became popular for a time in the big cities of the Eastern United States, with large venues like Madison Square Garden playing a part in popularizing them for new crowds. There was no standardization of events for a rodeo competition until 1929, when associations began forming.

In the 1970s, rodeo saw unprecedented growth. Contestants referred to as &quot;the new breed&quot; brought rodeo increasing media attention. These contestants were young, often from an urban background, and chose rodeo for its athletic rewards. By 1985, one third of PRCA members had a college education and as many as one half of the competitors had never worked on a cattle ranch. Today, some professional rodeos are staged indoors in large, climate-controlled arenas and many are telecast. Other professional rodeos are held outdoors.

===Women===

Historically, women have long participated in competitive rodeo. Prairie Rose Henderson debuted at the Cheyenne rodeo in 1901, and, by 1920, women were competing in rough stock events, relay races and trick riding. But after Bonnie McCarroll died in the Pendleton Round-Up in 1929 and Marie Gibson died in a horse wreck in 1933, women&#x27;s competitive participation was curbed. Rodeo women organized into various associations and staged their own rodeos. Today, women&#x27;s barrel racing is included as a competitive event in professional rodeo, with breakaway roping and goat tying added at collegiate and lower levels. They compete equally with men in team roping, sometimes in mixed-sex teams. Women also compete in traditional roping and rough stock events at women-only rodeos.

==Competitive events==
Professional rodeos in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand usually incorporate both timed events and rough stock events, most commonly tie-down roping, team roping, steer wrestling, saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding, bull riding, breakaway roping, and barrel racing. Additional events may be included at the collegiate and high school level, such as goat tying. Some events are based on traditional ranch practices; others are modern developments and have no counterpart in ranch practice.

Rodeos may also offer western-themed entertainment at intermission, including music and novelty acts, such as trick riding.

===Timed events===
====Roping====
Roping competitions are based on the tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult cattle for branding, medical treatment and other purposes. The cowboy must throw a type of rope with a loop, known as a lariat, &quot;riata&quot; or &quot;reata&quot;, or lasso, over the head of a calf or onto the horns and around the hind legs of adult cattle, and secure the animal in a fashion dictated by its size and age.
* Calf roping, also called tie-down roping in the United States and Canada and rope and tie in Australia and New Zealand, is based on ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo&#x27;s timed events. The cowboy ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the calf falls when roped, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. A well-trained calf-roping horse will slowly back up while the cowboy ties the calf, to help keep the lariat snug.
* Breakaway roping is a form of calf roping where a very short lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn with string and a flag. When the calf is roped about the neck, the horse stops, the flagged rope breaks free of the saddle, and the calf runs on without being thrown or tied. In most of the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12. In places where traditional &quot;tie-down&quot; calf roping is not allowed, riders of both genders compete.
* Team roping, also called heading and heeling, is the only rodeo event where men and women riders compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the &quot;header,&quot; lassos a running steer&#x27;s horns, while the other horse and rider, the &quot;heeler,&quot; lassos the steer&#x27;s two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that both ropes are taut. This technique originated from methods of capture and restraint for treatment used on a ranch.

====Other timed events====
* Barrel racing is a timed speed and agility event. In barrel racing, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In professional, collegiate and high school rodeo, barrel racing is an exclusively women&#x27;s sport, though men and boys occasionally compete at local O-Mok-See competition.

* Steer wrestling, also known as bulldogging, is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a Corriente steer and wrestles it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. It is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer, or of having the thrown steer land on top of them, sometimes horns first.
* Goat tying is usually an event for women or pre-teen girls and boys; a goat is staked out while a mounted rider runs to the goat, dismounts, grabs the goat, throws it to the ground and ties it in the same manner as a calf. The horse must not come into contact with the goat or its tether. The event was designed to teach smaller or younger riders the basics of calf roping without requiring the more complex skill of roping the animal. This event is not part of professional rodeo competition.

===&quot;Rough stock&quot; competition===

In spite of popular myth, most modern &quot;broncs&quot; are not in fact wild horses, but are more commonly spoiled riding horses or horses bred specifically as bucking stock. Rough stock events also use at least two well-trained riding horses ridden by pickup riders (either men or women), tasked with assisting fallen riders and helping successful riders get safely off the bucking animal.
* Bronc riding – there are two divisions in rodeo; bareback bronc riding, where the rider is only allowed to hang onto a bucking horse with a type of surcingle called a rigging; and saddle bronc riding, where the rider uses a specialized western saddle without a horn (for safety) and hangs onto a heavy lead rope, called a bronc rein, which is attached to a halter on the horse.
* Bull riding is an event where the cowboys ride full-grown bucking bulls instead of horses. Although skills and equipment similar to those needed for bareback bronc riding are required, the event differs considerably from horse riding competition due to the danger involved. Because bulls are unpredictable and may attack a fallen rider, rodeo clowns, now known as &quot;bullfighters&quot;, work during bull-riding competition to distract the bulls and help prevent injury to competitors.

* Steer riding is a rough stock event for boys and girls where children ride steers, usually in a manner similar to bulls. Ages vary by region, as there is no national rule set for this event, but generally participants are at least eight years old and compete through about age 14. It is a training event for bronc riding and bull riding.

====Less common events====
Several other events may be scheduled on a rodeo program depending upon the rodeo&#x27;s governing association.
* Steer roping is not listed as an official PRCA event, and banned in several states, but quietly recognized by the PRCA in some areas. It is rarely seen in the United States today because of the tremendous risk of injury to all involved, as well as animal cruelty concerns. A single roper ropes the steer around the horns, throws the rope around the steer&#x27;s back hip, dallies, and rides in a ninety-degree angle to the roped steer (opposite side from the aforementioned hip). The action brings the steer&#x27;s head around toward the legs in such a manner as to redirect the steer&#x27;s head towards its back legs. This causes the steer to trip. Steers are too big to tie in the manner used for calves. Absent a &quot;heeler,&quot; it is very difficult for one person to restrain a grown steer once down. However, the steer&#x27;s trip causes it to be temporarily incapacitated allowing its legs to be tied in a manner akin to calf roping. The event has roots in ranch practices north of the Rio Grande, but is no longer seen at the majority of American rodeos. However, it is practiced at some rodeos in Mexico, and may also be referred to as &quot;steer tripping.&quot;
* Steer daubing is usually seen at lower levels of competition and is an event to help young competitors learn skills later needed for steer wrestling. A rider carrying a long stick with a paint-filled dauber at the end attempts to run up alongside a steer and place a mark of paint inside a circle that has been drawn on the side of the animal.
* Pole bending is a speed and agility competition sometimes seen at local and high school rodeos. It is more commonly viewed as a gymkhana or O-Mok-See competition. In pole bending, the horse and rider run the length of a line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, then return to the start.
* Chute dogging is an event to teach pre-teen boys how to steer wrestle. The competitor enters a bucking chute with a small steer. The boy will then place his right arm around the steer&#x27;s neck and left hand on top of its neck. When ready, the gate is opened and steer and contestant exit the chute. Once they cross over a designated line, the competitor will grab onto the horns of the steer (colloquially, to &quot;hook-up&quot; to the steer) and wrestle it to the ground.
===Other activities===

Outside of competitive events, other activities are often associated with rodeos, particularly at local levels. A typical rodeo begins with a &quot;Grand Entry&quot;, in which mounted riders, many carrying flags, including the American flag, state flags, banners representing sponsors, and others enter the arena at a gallop, circle once, come to the center of the arena and stop while the remaining participants enter. The grand entry is used to introduce some of the competitors, officials, and sponsors. It is capped by the presentation of the American flag, usually with a rendition of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner,&quot; and, depending on region, other ceremonies. If a rodeo queen is crowned, the contestants or winner and runners-up may also be presented.

Variety acts, which may include musicians, trick riders or other entertainment may occur halfway through the rodeo at intermission. Some rodeos may also include novelty events, such as steer riding for preteens or mutton busting for small children. In some places, various types of novelty races or events such as wild cow milking are offered for adults. Such contests often are unregulated, with a higher risk of injury to human participants and poor treatment of animals than in traditionally-sanctioned events, particularly if consumption of alcoholic beverages by participants is permitted.

==Governing associations in the United States==
Formal associations and detailed rules came late to rodeo. Until the mid-1930s, every rodeo was independent and selected its own events from among nearly one hundred different contests. Until World War I, there was little difference between rodeo and &quot;charreada&quot;. Athletes from the US, Mexico and Canada competed freely in all three countries. Later &quot;charreada&quot; was formalized as an amateur team sport and the international competitions ceased. It remains popular in Mexico and Hispanic communities of the U.S. today.

Numerous associations govern rodeo in the United States, each with slightly different rules and different events. The oldest and largest sanctioning body of professional rodeo is the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA) which governs about a third of all rodeos staged in the US annually. It was originally named the Cowboys Turtle Association, later became the Rodeo Cowboys Association, and finally the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association in 1975. The PRCA crowns the World Champions at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), in Las Vegas on the UNLV campus, featuring the top fifteen money-winners in seven events.

The Professional Bull Riders (PBR) is a more recent organization dedicated solely to bull riding. Rodeo gender bias was a problem for cowgirls, and in response women formed the Girls Rodeo Association in 1948 (now the Women&#x27;s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) and held their own rodeos. The Women&#x27;s Professional Rodeo Association (WPRA) is open exclusively to women. Women&#x27;s barrel racing is governed by the WPRA, which holds finals for barrel racing along with the PRCA with the cowboys at the NFR. There are associations governing children&#x27;s, teen, and college level rodeos as well as associations governing rodeo for gays, seniors, Native Americans and others.

There are also high-school rodeos, sponsored by the National High School Rodeo Association (NHSRA). Many colleges, particularly land grant colleges in the west, have rodeo teams. The National Intercollegiate Rodeo Association (NIRA) is responsible for the College National Finals Rodeo (CNFR) held each June in Casper, Wyoming northwest of Laramie. Other rodeo governing bodies in the United States include American Junior Rodeo Association (AJRA) for contestants under twenty years of age; National Little Britches Rodeo Association (NLBRA), for youths ages five to eighteen; Senior Pro Rodeo (SPR), for people forty years old or over; and the International Gay Rodeo Association. Each association has its own regulations and its own method of determining champions. Athletes participate in rodeos sanctioned by their own governing body or one that has a mutual agreement with theirs and their points count for qualification to their Association Finals. Rodeo committees must pay sanctioning fees to the appropriate governing bodies, and employ the needed stock contractors, judges, announcers, bull fighters, and barrel men from their approved lists. Other nations have similar sanctioning associations.

Until recently, the most important was PRCA, which crowns the World Champions at the National Finals Rodeo (NFR), held since 1985 in Las Vegas, Nevada, featuring the top fifteen money winners in seven events. The athletes who have won the most money, including NFR earnings, in each event are the World&#x27;s Champions. However, since 1992, Professional Bull Riders (PBR) has drawn many top bull riders, and holds its own multimillion-dollar individual-season World Finals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex every spring and Team Series Championship in Las Vegas every autumn since 2022. Women&#x27;s barrel racing is governed by the WPRA, and holds its finals along with the PRCA with the cowboys at the NFR.

Contemporary rodeo is a lucrative business. More than 7,500 cowboys compete for over thirty million dollars at 650 rodeos annually. Women&#x27;s barrel racing, sanctioned by the WPRA, has taken place at most of these rodeos. Over 2,000 barrel racers compete for nearly four million dollars annually. Professional cowgirls also compete in bronc and bull riding, team roping and calf roping under the auspices of the PWRA, a WPRA subsidiary. However, numbers are small, about 120 members, and these competitors go largely unnoticed, with only twenty rodeos and seventy individual contests available annually. The total purse at the PWRA National Finals is $50,000. Meanwhile, the PBR has 800 members from three continents and ten million dollars in prize money.

==Canada==

The first rodeo in Canada was held in 1902 in Raymond, Alberta, when Raymond Knight funded and promoted a rodeo contest for bronc riders and steer ropers called the Raymond Stampede. Knight also coined the rodeo term &quot;stampede&quot; and built rodeo&#x27;s first known shotgun-style bucking chute. In 1903, Knight built Canada&#x27;s first rodeo arena and grandstand and became the first rodeo producer and rodeo stock contractor.

In 1912, Guy Weadick and several investors put up $100,000 to create what today is the Calgary Stampede. The Stampede also incorporated mythical and historical elements, including Native Indians in full regalia, chuckwagon races, the Mounted Police, and marching bands. From its beginning, the event has been held the second week in July, and since 1938, attendees were urged to dress for the occasion in western hats to add to the event&#x27;s flavour.

By 2003, it was estimated that 65 professional rodeos involving 700 members of the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA) took place in Western Canada, along with professionals from the United States. Many Canadian contestants were part-timers who did not earn a significant living from rodeo.

Canadians made several significant contributions to the sport of rodeo. In 1916, at the Bascom Ranch in Welling, Alberta, southwest of 
Medicine Hat. John W. Bascom and his sons Raymond, Mel, and Earl designed and built rodeo&#x27;s first side-delivery bucking chute for the ranch rodeos they were producing. In 1919, Earl and John made rodeo&#x27;s first reverse-opening side-delivery bucking chute at the Bascom Ranch in Lethbridge in southern Alberta. The Bascom-style bucking chute is now rodeo&#x27;s standard design. Earl Bascom also continued his innovative contributions to the sport of rodeo by designing and making rodeo&#x27;s first hornless bronc saddle in 1922, rodeo&#x27;s first one-hand bareback rigging in 1924, and the first high-cut rodeo chaps in 1928. Earl and his brother Weldon also produced rodeo&#x27;s first night rodeo held outdoors under electric lights in 1935.

The Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame is located in Ponoka, Alberta.

==Minority participation in the United States and Canada==
Native American and Hispanic cowboys compete in modern rodeos in small numbers. African Americans constitute a smaller minority of rodeo contestants, though many early rodeo champions, such as Nat Love, were African American. Bill Pickett and bronc rider Bill Stahl were both elected to the Cowboy Hall of Fame. During the 1940s and 1950s, African Americans created the Southwestern Colored Cowboys Association. Although the PRCA never formally excluded people of color, pre-1960s racism effectively kept many minority participants, particularly African Americans, out of white competitions. In the 1960s, bull rider Myrtis Dightman vied for national honors and qualified for the National Finals Rodeo. In the 1990s, the Black World Championship Rodeo was held in New York City and other locations across the United States. Mexican Americans have had a long history with both rodeo and &quot;charreada&quot;. In spite of its long association with southwestern culture, there has been significant assimilation and cross-acculturation  Mexican Americans are so integrated into the southwestern cowboy culture that they are not visibly distinct. Brazilians also have a long and successful history of bull riding in the United States. In 2017, 37% of the top 35 riders in the Professional Bull Riding circuit were Brazilian.

In 1976, the first gay rodeo was held in Reno, Nevada, as a charity fundraiser. Several regional gay rodeo organizations were formed in the following years, and, in 1985, the existing organizations formed the International Gay Rodeo Association as a national sanctioning body. The melding of homosexuality and straight cowboy culture in gay rodeo simultaneously embraces and contemporary gay identity. Openly gay competitors stage their own rodeos because they are not welcomed in the straight circuit. &quot;We can ride with the best of them,&quot; one person stated, &quot;But they don&#x27;t want us around.&quot;

==Latin America==

===Mexico===

The is the national sport of Mexico. It is a display and contest of roping and riding with origins tracing to the cattle ranching life and culture of colonial Mexico. Over time, it became an event that included games, parades, foods, and contests involving humans, cattle, and horses. Following the Mexican Revolution of 1910, many rural Mexicans were displaced and took up residence in cities, where urban-based charros and others formed associations to establish and refine the .

During the Chicano Movement of the 1970s, Mexican Americans revitalized their heritage by establishing the event in the United States. The event historically enjoys greater prestige in Mexico, however, and due to animal cruelty concerns, some events have been banned in the US. Unlike rodeos, most do not award money to the winners as is considered an amateur sport, but trophies may be distributed. Until recently, the was confined to men, but a women&#x27;s precision equestrian event called the &quot;escaramuza&quot; is the fourth in a total of ten events in a . Unlike American rodeo, events are not timed, but judged and scored based on finesse and grace.

American rodeo in Mexico had its origins in the state of Chihuahua in the 1930s. By the mid-to-late 20th century, the sport gained ground in other parts of the country; mainly in the northern and central regions. The Federación Mexicana de Rodeo (Mexican Rodeo Federation) was formed in 1992 as the leading organization of the sport in the country. The &quot;Campeonato Nacional de Rodeo&quot; (National Rodeo Championship), sanctioned by said organization and held consistently since 2000, has been held to determine the national champions in American rodeo. The annual event is held in the city of Chihuahua.

===Colombia and Venezuela===
&quot;Coleo&quot; is a traditional Venezuelan and Colombian sport, similar to American rodeo, where a small group of (cowboys) on horseback pursue cattle at high speeds through a narrow pathway (called a ) in order to drop or tumble them.
 are usually presented as a side attraction to a larger event, such as a religious festival. They are very popular in Venezuela and in parts of Colombia, mostly in the plains ().
A starts with the participants and a calf or bull (this depends on the age and stature of the competitors) locked behind a trap door. The trap door leads to a narrow earthen pathway about 100 metres long with high guard rails, open at the other end. When a judge gives a signal, the calf is set loose and starts running. A couple of seconds later, the riders are released and they race to grab the calf by its tail. The rider who accomplishes this first will increase speed, dragging the calf until it finally stumbles. The object is to accomplish that in the shortest time.

===Brazil===
Brazilian can be traced to the town of Barretos, where the primary economic activities involved livestock and its transport to other locations; one of the ways the cowboys entertained themselves was by riding the animals. In 1956, the first ever Festa do Peão de Boiadeiro was created and as the years went by, this rodeo became the biggest in Brazil and in Latin America. Barretos is the most famous rodeo in Brazil. However, rodeos are very common in inner state towns in Brazil, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso do Sul and São Paulo state. Bull riding is a significant sport in the country; Since 2006, PBR runs a national circuit in Brazil, and Brazilian riders are a major presence on the main PBR circuit in the United States. PBR also hosts a Brazilian Finals. Apart from PBR Brazil, there are also a number of other bull riding and rodeo organizations in the country. Brazil also has its own unique style of bronc riding, called &quot;cutiano&quot;.

===Argentina===
In the twentieth century, rodeo&#x27;s popularity increased in Argentina. Buenos Aires, Rosario, and other major cities hosted rodeos. In 1909, the Sociedad Sportiva Argentina (Argentina Sports Society) announced a rodeo competition in which the winners would eventually compete in the United States against rodeo performers from other countries.

===Chile===
Second to association football (soccer), rodeo is the most popular sport in Chile, and became the national sport of Chile on January 10, 1962, by decree number 269 of the National Council of Sports and the Chilean Olympic Committee.

Chilean rodeo traces to the 16th century, beginning with gathering together lost or stray cattle in the Plaza de Armas de Santiago for branding and selection. Rodeos began to be regulated in the 17th century and talented riders received honors and awards.

In Chilean rodeo, a team of two mounted men (called a ) attempt to pin a calf against large cushions lining the arena (&quot;medialuna&quot;). Points are earned for proper technique. Chilean Horses are employed to the exclusion of others and riders wear traditional &quot;huaso&quot; garb as a requirement. The sport has become so popular that in 2004, more spectators attended rodeo events than professional football matches.

Chilean rodeo has experienced financial woes, lack of political support and poor promotion. Unlike other Chilean sports, rodeo does not receive any of the revenue from &quot;Chiledeportes&quot; because only sports that represent Chile overseas receive funds. The Chilean Rodeo Federation has criticized the lack of governmental funding and has pointed out that rodeo reaches a part of the population that does not have access to other Chilean sports.

===El Salvador===
In El Salvador, rodeo is very popular. They are also called and are celebrated mainly during each municipality&#x27;s festivities. Traditionally, people dress up as cowboys or wear clothing related to raising cattle.

The history of rodeos/ originates in Metapán (considered the rodeo/ capital of El Salvador). Stories from neighbors indicate that the first Metapán was held in 1937 on a property located on Las Parejas street, with a wild colt. Then came bull riding, sparking competition between the ranches of that time. After its popularity began to spread, in 1965 a group of ranchers built a coliseum. In later years, rodeo and have spread throughout El Salvador, becoming a livestock tradition.

==Australia and the Pacific==
===Australia===
Rodeos have long been a popular competitor and spectator sport in Australia, but were not run on an organized basis until the 1880s. The National Agricultural Society of Victoria ran one of the earliest recorded events in 1888, when a roughriding competition was held at their annual show. Travelling tent rodeo shows increased the popularity of roughriding throughout much of Australia. However, by 1930, the Great Depression left only a few of these traveling shows on the road.

Bushmen&#x27;s Carnivals, the Australian equivalent of American rodeos, originated in Northern New South Wales in the 1920s and were well established by the 1930s. Australian rodeo continued to grow following WWII, and by September 1978 riders from the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia competed in the World Rodeo Titles there for prize money totaling $60,000. In 1982, an Australian Bushmen&#x27;s Carnival Association team competed in the North American Rodeo Commission&#x27;s championships in Denver finishing sixth overall.

In August 1944 the Australian Bushmen&#x27;s Carnival Association (ABCA) was formed by the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales, as a result of the increase in the number of bushmen&#x27;s carnivals. The purpose of this formation was to standardize regulations and rules, but insufficient support was given and the association was terminated in 1947. The Australian Professional Rodeo Association (APRA) was also formed in 1944 and is the national governing body for professional rodeo competition. Also formed in 1944 was the Australian Rough-Riders Association (ARRA) in South Australia. On 28 March 1946 the Northern (N.S.W.) Bushmen&#x27;s Carnival Association was founded in Maitland, New South Wales north of Newcastle. The two associations are now the Australian Bushmen&#x27;s Campdraft &amp; Rodeo Association (ABCRA). The ABCRA is the largest rodeo and campdraft organization in Australia. In May 1992 the National Rodeo Council of Australia (NRCA) was formed to further the sport of rodeo and has represented ABCRA and several other associations.

Original events included buckjumping (saddle broncs), bullock riding, campdrafting, bulldogging, wild-cow milking, wild bullock races, wild horse races and releasing the surcingle. Other common sporting events such as flag and bending races (similar to pole bending) were held for the competitors&#x27; horses.

Later the term &quot;rodeo&quot; became more commonly used, with American saddles used; the events also took on American naming patterns. The ABCRA now affiliates the sports of campdrafting, roughriding (saddle bronc and bareback riding, steer and bull riding) and timed rodeo events: barrel races (ladies&#x27; and junior), rope and tie, steer undecorating (ladies&#x27;), steer wrestling, junior calf riding, team roping and breakaway roping (ladies&#x27;). There are strict standards for the selection, care and treatment of rodeo livestock, arenas, plus equipment requirements and specifications. In 1992 the National Rodeo Queen Quest was founded by the National Rodeo Council of Australia to promote and encourage young women into the sport of rodeo.

The carnivals and rodeos typically take place during the spring and summer, and are usually arranged to avoid date clashes, so that competitors may take part in as many events as possible. The prize money is obtained from donations and entry fees, with the main prize money being for the open campdraft event.

The biggest rodeos are in Queensland. Some large events are also held in New South Wales, where Sydney has a rodeo during the Royal Agricultural Society show and Walcha holds a four-day campdrafting and rodeo competition annually. There also is a National Finals Rodeo.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, rodeo was introduced in the island during the American colonial era in the Philippines by the then-Acting Governor of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu Teofisto Guingona Sr. setting up ranches in Impasugong, Bukidnon and Wao, Lanao del Sur. Rodeo is recognized today as the provincial sport of Bukidnon. Rodeo events have also been held in the province of Masbate, known for its cattle industry; it was declared the &quot;Rodeo Capital of the Philippines&quot; in 2002 by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The province-wide festival Rodeo Masbateño was first organized in 1993, to promote Masbate&#x27;s cattle industry and boost its tourism.

==Animal treatment controversies==

Protests were first raised regarding rodeo animal cruelty in the 1870s, and, beginning in the 1930s, some states enacted laws curtailing rodeo activities and other events involving animals. In the 1950s, the then Rodeo Cowboys Association (RCA, later the PRCA) worked with the American Humane Association (AHA) to establish regulations protecting the welfare of rodeo animals that were acceptable to both organizations. The PRCA realized that public education regarding rodeo and the welfare of animals was needed to keep the sport alive.

Over the years, conditions for animals in rodeo and many other sporting events improved. Today, the PRCA and other rodeo sanctioning organizations have stringent regulations to ensure rodeo animals&#x27; welfare. For example, these rules require, among other things, provisions for injured animals, a veterinarian&#x27;s presence at all rodeos (a similar requirement exists for other equine events), padded flank straps, horn protection for steers, and spurs with dulled, free-spinning rowels. Rodeo competitors in general value and provide excellent care to the animals with which they work. Animals must also be protected with fleece-lined flank straps for bucking stock and horn wraps for roping steers.

Laws governing rodeo vary widely. In the American west, some states incorporate the regulations of the PRCA into their statutes as a standard by which to evaluate if animal cruelty has occurred. On the other hand, some events and practices are restricted or banned in other states, including California, Rhode Island, and Ohio. St. Petersburg, Florida is the only locality in the United States with a complete ban on rodeo. Canadian Humane Societies are careful in criticizing Canadian rodeo as the event has become so indigenous to Western Canada that criticism may jeopardize support for the organization&#x27;s other humane goals. The Calgary Humane Society itself is wary of criticizing the famous Calgary Stampede. Internationally rodeo itself is banned in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and other European nations have placed restrictions on certain practices.

However, a number of humane and animal rights organizations have policy statements that oppose many rodeo practices and often the events themselves. Some also claim that regulations vary from vague to ineffective and are frequently violated. Other groups assert that any regulation still allows rodeo animals to be subjected to gratuitous harm for the sake of entertainment, and therefore rodeos should be banned altogether.

In response to these concerns, a number of cities and states, mostly in the eastern half of the United States, have passed ordinances and laws governing rodeo. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for example, specifically prohibits electric prods or shocking devices, wire tie-downs, and sharpened or fixed spurs or rowels. It also previously prohibited flank straps. Pittsburgh also requires humane officers be provided access to any and all areas where animals may go—specifically pens, chutes, and injury pens. However, the ban on rodeo events has been at least partially lifted, since the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) held an event in Pittsburgh in January 2025. A flank strap is used on every bucking bull that performs in the PBR. It is a soft cotton rope tied relatively loosely around the haunches of the bull, used to encourage a genetically pre-disposed bucking bull to kick. A licensed veterinarian is present at all PBR events. The state of Rhode Island has banned tie-down roping and certain other practices. Other locales have similar ordinances and laws.
===Positions taken by animal welfare organizations===
There are three basic areas of concern to various groups. The first set of concerns surround relatively common rodeo practices, such as the use of bucking straps, also known as flank straps, the use of metal or electric cattle prods, and tail-twisting. The second set of concerns surround non-traditional rodeo events that operate outside the rules of sanctioning organizations. These are usually amateur events such as mutton busting, calf dressing, wild cow milking, calf riding, chuck wagon races, and other events designed primarily for publicity, half-time entertainment or crowd participation. Finally, some groups consider some or all rodeo events themselves to be cruel.

Groups such as PETA, and SHARK, and the Humane Society of the United States generally take a position of opposition to all rodeos and rodeo events. A more general position is taken by the ASPCA, only opposing rodeo events that &quot;involve cruel, painful, stressful and potentially harmful treatment of livestock, not only in performance but also in handling, transport and prodding to perform.&quot; The group singles out children&#x27;s rodeo events such as goat tying, calf riding and sheep riding (“mutton busting”), &quot;which do not promote humane care and respect for animals.&quot;

The American Humane Association (AHA) does not appear to oppose rodeos per se, though they have a general position on events and contests involving animals, stating that &quot;when animals are involved in entertainment, they must be treated humanely at all times.&quot; The AHA also has strict requirements for the treatment of animals used for rodeo scenes in movies, starting with the rules of the PRCA and adding additional requirements consistent with the association&#x27;s other policies. Unique among animal protection groups, the ASPCA specifically notes that practice sessions are often the location of more severe abuses than competitions. However, many state animal cruelty laws provide specific exemptions for &quot;training practices.&quot; The American Humane Association is the only organization addressing the legislative issue, advocating the strengthening of animal cruelty laws in general, with no exceptions for &quot;training practices.&quot;

===Modern practice===
It is a myth that a modern bucking horse is a wild animal. The modern bronc is not a truly feral horse. Some bucking horses are riding horses that learned to buck off their riders. Other bucking horses are specifically bred for use in rodeos.

A proven bucking horse can be sold for $8000 to $10,000 or more, making rough stock a valuable investment worth caring for and keeping in good health for many years. Likewise, bucking bulls are also selectively bred. Most are allowed to grow up in a natural, semi-wild condition on the open range, but also have to be trained in order to be managed from the ground, safely loaded into trailers, vaccinated and wormed, and be loaded in and out of bucking chutes.

Young bucking horses are initially introduced to work with cloth dummies attached to the saddle. Others are already well-trained on the ground. Some champion bucking horses got their start as riding horses that learned how to quickly and effectively unseat riders. Due to the rigors of travel and the short bursts of high intensity work required, most horses in a bucking string are at least six or seven years old before they are used extensively, and are expected to be sound performers for many years. Awards are given to the owners of the best bucking horses, who are respected as equine athletes and perform for many years. Many are retired to pasture at the end of their careers. Many bucking horses understand their job well and reduce or stop their bucking, even while still wearing a flank strap, as soon as they either unseat the rider or hear the buzzer.

===Industry position===
Modern rodeos in the United States are closely regulated and have responded to accusations of animal cruelty by instituting a number of rules to guide how rodeo animals are to be managed. In 1994, a survey of 28 sanctioned rodeos was conducted by on-site independent veterinarians. Reviewing 33,991 animal runs, the injury rate was documented at 16 animals or 0.047 percent, less than five-hundredths of one percent or one in 2000 animals. A study of rodeo animals in Australia found a similar injury rate. Basic injuries occurred at a rate of 0.072 percent, or one in 1405, with injuries requiring veterinary attention at 0.036 percent, or one injury in every 2810 times the animal was used, and transport, yarding and competition were all included in the study. A later PRCA survey of 60,971 animal performances at 198 rodeo performances and 73 sections of &quot;slack&quot; indicated 27 animals were injured, again approximately five-hundredths of 1
percent—0.0004.

Nonetheless, accusation of cruelty in the USA persist. The PRCA acknowledges that they only sanction about 30 percent of all rodeos, while another 50 percent are sanctioned by other organizations and 20 percent are completely unsanctioned. The PRCA opposes the general concept of animal rights, but supports animal welfare. The PRCA takes the position that the organization does this and even goes beyond expectation. Not all rodeos are governed by the PRCA however, though organizations governing collegiate and high school rodeos base their rules on those of the PRCA. Nonetheless, certain amateur and &quot;backyard&quot; rodeos are unregulated, and do not follow PRCA rules.

Advocates for rodeo say that sick, injured, hungry, or severely abused animals cannot perform well in a given event. Rough stock must be healthy and well fed to give the cowboy a powerful and challenging ride sufficient to obtain a high score. The bucking strap has to be an incentive to an animal that already wants to buck off a rider, not a prod, or the animal will either flee the pain, not buck, quickly sour and refuse to work, regardless of any pain that might be inflicted. Steers and roping calves will not break from the chute fast enough for ropers to achieve a fast time if they are lame or weak, and because of size and weight restrictions for each event, they are not generally used for more than a single season.

Health regulations mandate vaccinations and blood testing of animals crossing state lines, so rodeo stock receives routine care. An injured animal will not buck well and hence a cowboy cannot obtain a high score for his ride, so sick or injured animals are not run through the chutes, but instead are given appropriate veterinary care so they can be returned to their usual level of strength and power. PRCA regulations require veterinarians to be available at all rodeos to treat both bucking stock and other animals as needed.

The PRCA emphasizes that they first promulgated rules for proper and humane treatment of livestock in 1947, a full seven years before the founding of the Humane Society of the United States. Participants are fined for animal abuse, and a study of 21 PRCA rodeos found only 15 animals injured in 26,584 performances, a 0.06 percent rate.

There are occasions of rule violations and animal mistreatment at sanctioned rodeos. The major national rodeos are also under the most intense scrutiny and are the most likely to rigorously follow the rules. Rodeos not subject to the rules of the PRCA or other organizations, and rodeos outside of the United States and Canada, where animal cruelty laws are weaker, are more likely to be the sites of abusive practices.

==In popular culture==
The largest state-of-the-art rodeos are professional, commercial athletic contests held in climate-controlled stadiums, with broadcasting by various television networks. Outside of the rodeo world itself, there is disagreement about exactly what rodeo is. Professional competitors, for example, view rodeo as a sport and call themselves professional athletes while also using the title of cowboy. Fans view rodeo as a spectator sport with animals, having aspects of pageantry and theater unlike other professional sport. Non-westerners view the spectacle as a quaint but exciting remnant of the Wild West while animal rights activists view rodeo as a cruel Roman circus spectacle, or an Americanized bullfight.

Anthropologists studying the sport of rodeo and the culture surrounding it have commented that it is &quot;a blend of both performance and contest&quot;, and that rodeo is far more expressive in blending both these aspects than attempting to stand alone on one or the other. Rodeo&#x27;s performance level permits pageantry and ritual which serve to &quot;revitalize the spirit of the Old West&quot; while its contest level poses a man-animal opposition that articulates the transformation of nature and &quot;dramatizes and perpetuates the conflict between the wild and the tame.&quot; &quot;On its deepest level, rodeo is essentially a ritual addressing itself to the dilemma of man&#x27;s place in nature.&quot;

Rodeo is a popular topic in country-western music such as the 1991 Garth Brooks hit single &quot;Rodeo&quot;, and has also been featured in numerous movies, television programs and in literature. &quot;Rodeo&quot; is a ballet score written by Aaron Copland in 1942, and choreographer Agnes de Mille&#x27;s ballet, &quot;Rodeo&quot; was commissioned by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1942 with the Copland score. Country singer Chris Ledoux from Mississippi and Wyoming competed in bareback riding and wrote many songs based on his experiences. Rodeo has also been featured in a significant number of films, and some focus specifically on the sport, such as &quot;My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys&quot;, &quot;8 Seconds&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Up&quot;, &quot;The Longest Ride&quot;, and &quot;The Rider&quot;.

<text>In Greek and Roman mythology, a harpy (plural harpies, , ; ) is a half-human and half-bird mythical creature, often believed to be a personification of storm winds. They feature in Homeric poems.

==Descriptions==
Harpies were generally depicted as birds with the heads of maidens, faces pale with hunger and long claws on their hands. Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness. Pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings. Ovid described them as human-vultures.

===Hesiod===
To Hesiod, they were imagined as fair-locked and winged maidens, who flew as fast as the wind:
===Aeschylus===
Even as early as the time of Aeschylus, harpies were thought to be ugly creatures with wings, and later writers carried their notions of the harpies so far as to represent them as most disgusting monsters. The Pythian priestess of Apollo compares the appearance of the Erinyes, cthonic goddesses of vengeance, with those of harpies in the following lines of The Eumenides:

===Virgil===
===Hyginus===
==Functions and abodes==

The harpies seem originally to have been wind spirits (personifications of the destructive nature of wind). Their name means &#x27;snatchers&#x27; or &#x27;swift robbers&#x27;, and they were said to steal food from their victims while they were eating and carry evildoers (especially those who have killed their families) to the Erinyes. When a person suddenly disappeared from the Earth, it was said that he had been carried off by the harpies. Thus, they carried off the daughters of King Pandareus and gave them as servants to the Erinyes. In this form they were agents of punishment who abducted people and tortured them on their way to Tartarus. They were depicted as vicious, cruel, and violent.

The harpies were called &quot;the hounds of mighty Zeus&quot; thus &quot;ministers of the Thunderer (Zeus)&quot;. Later writers listed the harpies among the guardians of the underworld among other monstrosities including the Centaurs, Scylla, Briareus, Lernaean Hydra, Chimera, Gorgons and Geryon.

Their abode was described as either the islands called Strofades, a place at the entrance of Orcus, or a cave in Crete.

==Names and family==
Hesiod calls them two &quot;lovely-haired&quot; creatures, the daughters of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra and sisters of Iris. Hyginus, however, cited a certain Ozomene as the mother of the harpies but he also recounted that Electra was also the mother of these beings in the same source. This can be explained by the fact that Ozomene was another name for Electra. The harpies possibly were siblings of the river-god Hydaspes and Arke, as they were called sisters of Iris and children of Thaumas. According to Valerius, Typhoeus (Typhon) was said to be the father of these monsters while a different version by Servius told that the harpies were daughters of Pontus and Gaea or of Poseidon.

They were named Aello (&quot;storm swift&quot;) and Ocypete (&quot;the swift wing&quot;), and Virgil added Celaeno (&quot;the dark&quot;) as a third. Homer knew of a harpy named Podarge (&quot;fleet-foot&quot;). Aello is sometimes also spelled Aellopus or Nicothoe; Ocypete is sometimes also spelled Ocythoe or Ocypode.

Homer called the harpy Podarge as the mother of the two horses (Balius and Xanthus) of Achilles sired by the West Wind Zephyrus while according to Nonnus, Xanthus and Podarkes, horses of the Athenian king Erechtheus, were born to Aello and the North Wind Boreas. Other progeny of Podarge were Phlogeus and Harpagos, horses given by Hermes to the Dioscuri, who competed for the chariot-race in celebration of the funeral games of Pelias. The swift horse Arion was also said to begotten by loud-piping Zephyrus on a harpy (probably Podarge), as attested by Quintus Smyrnaeus.
==Mythology==
The most celebrated story in which the harpies play a part is that of King Phineus of Thrace, who was given the gift of prophecy by Zeus. Angry that Phineus gave away the god&#x27;s secret plan, Zeus punished him by blinding him and putting him on an island with a buffet of food which he could never eat because the harpies always arrived to steal the food out of his hands before he could satisfy his hunger. Later writers add that they either devoured the food themselves, or that they dirtied it by dropping upon it some stinking substance, so as to render it unfit to be eaten.

This continued until the arrival of Jason and the Argonauts. Phineus promised to instruct them respecting the course they had to take, if they would deliver him from the harpies. The Boreads, sons of Boreas, the North Wind, who also could fly, succeeded in driving off the harpies. According to an ancient oracle, the harpies were to perish by the hands of the Boreades, but the Boreades were to die if they could not overtake the harpies. The harpies fled, but one fell into the river Tigris, which was hence called Harpys, and the other reached the Echinades, and as she never returned, the islands were called Strophades. But being worn out with fatigue, she fell down simultaneously with her pursuer; and, as they promised no further to molest Phineus, the two harpies were not deprived of their lives. According to others, the Boreades were on the point of killing the harpies, when Iris or Hermes appeared and commanded the conquerors to set them free, promising that Phineus would not be bothered by the harpies again. &quot;The dogs of great Zeus&quot; then returned to their &quot;cave in Minoan Crete&quot;. Other accounts said that both the harpies as well as the Boreades died. Thankful for their help, Phineus told the Argonauts how to pass the Symplegades.

Tzetzes explained the origin of the myth pertaining to Phineus, the harpies, and the Boreades in his account. In this late version of the myth it was said that Phineus, due to his old age, became blind, and he has two daughters named Eraseia and Harpyreia. These maidens lived a very libertine and lazy life, abandoning themselves to poverty and fatal famine. Then Zetes and Calais snatched them away somehow, and they disappeared from those places ever since. From this account all myths about them [i.e., the harpies] started, as was also retold by Apollonius in his own story of the Argonauts.

===Aeneid===
Aeneas encountered harpies on the Strophades as they repeatedly made off with the feast the Trojans were setting. Celaeno utters a prophecy: the Trojans will be so hungry they will eat their tables before they reach the end of their journey. The Trojans fled in fear.

==Later usage==
===Literature===
Harpies remained vivid in the Middle Ages. In Canto XIII of his &quot;Inferno&quot;, Dante Alighieri envisages the tortured wood infested with harpies, where the suicides have their punishment in the seventh ring of Hell:

In Canto XXXIII of Orlando Furioso, author Ludovico Ariosto has the Christian Ethiopian Emperor Senapo (Prester John) afflicted with harpies under circumstances nearly identical to those in the myth of Phineus. He has been blinded by God himself, and the harpies contaminate his every meal. Senapo is delivered from this torment by Astolfo, a paladin from the court of Charlemagne.

William Blake was inspired by Dante&#x27;s description in his pencil, ink, and watercolour &quot;The Wood of the Self-Murderers: The Harpies and the Suicides&quot; (Tate Gallery, London).

Harpies also found a role in Shakespeare&#x27;s Tempest, where the spirit Ariel tortured the antagonists Antonio, Sebastian, and Alonso for their crimes by staging a banquet scene similar to that in the Aeneid.

===Linguistic use and application===
The harpy eagle is a real bird named after the mythological animal.

The term is often used metaphorically to refer to a nasty or annoying woman. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, Benedick spots the sharp-tongued Beatrice approaching and exclaims to the prince, Don Pedro, that he would do an assortment of arduous tasks for him &quot;rather than hold three words conference with this harpy!&quot;

===Heraldry===
In the Middle Ages, the harpy, referred to in German as the or &quot;maiden eagle&quot; (although it may not have been modeled after the original harpy of Greek mythology), became a popular charge in heraldry, particularly in East Frisia, seen on, among others, the coats-of-arms of Rietberg, Liechtenstein, and the Cirksena. Among the earliest examples is the city of Nuremberg&#x27;s device, which used the harpy as early as 1243.

The harpy also appears in British heraldry, although it remains a peculiarly German device.

<text>In Greek mythology, Phineus (; ), was a king of Salmydessus in Thrace and seer, who appears in accounts of the Argonauts&#x27; voyage. Some accounts make him a king in Paphlagonia or in Arcadia.

== Family ==
Several different versions of Phineus&#x27;s parentage were presented in ancient texts. According to Apollonius of Rhodes, he was a son of Agenor, but the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; says that other authors named his father as Poseidon (who is the father of Agenor). The Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, on the other hand, reported that Phineus was the son of Phoenix and Cassiopeia.

His first wife was Cleopatra, daughter of Boreas and Oreithyia, by whom he had a pair of sons, named Plexippus and Pandion, or Gerymbas and Aspondus, or Polydector (Polydectus) and Polydorus, or Parthenius and Crambis, or Oryithus (Oarthus) and Crambis. His second wife, Idaea, daughter of the Scythian king Dardanus (less commonly Dia, Eidothea, sister of Cadmus, or Eurytia), deceived him into blinding these sons, a fate Phineus himself would suffer.

By his second wife, or by a Scythian concubine, Phineus had two more sons, Mariandynus and Thynus. According to some sources, he also had two daughters, Eraseia and Harpyreia while another daughter Olizone was called the wife of Dardanus, who was the son of Zeus and Electra, and became the mother of Erichthonius.

==Mythology==
Apollo was said to have given the gift of prophecy to Phineus, but the latter&#x27;s own blinding was variously attributed to the outrage against his sons, his giving Phrixus directions on his journey, or because he preferred long life to sight, or, as reported in the &quot;Argonautica&quot; (thus the best-known version), for revealing the future to mankind. For this reason he was also tormented by the Harpies, who stole or defiled whatever food he had at hand or, according to the &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, drove Phineus himself to the corners of the world. According to scholia on the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, when asked by Zeus if he preferred to die or lose sight as punishment for having his sons killed by their stepmother, Phineus chose the latter saying he would rather never see the sun, and consequently it was the scorned Helios who sent the Harpies against him. In yet another version, he blinded Phineus at the request of his son Aeëtes, who asked him to do so because Phineus offered his assistance to Aeëtes&#x27; enemies. Alternatively the agent of punishment was Poseidon. However the Harpies plagued him, deliverance from this curse motivated Phineus&#x27;s involvement in the voyage of the &quot;Argo&quot;. Those accounts in which Phineus is stated to have blinded his sons, add that they had their sight restored to them by the sons of Boreas, or by Asclepius.

When the ship landed by his Thracian home, Phineus described his torment to the crew and told them that his brothers-in-law, the wing-footed Boreads, both Argonauts, were fated to deliver him from the Harpies. Zetes demurred, fearing the wrath of the gods should they deliver Phineus from divine punishment, but the old seer assured him that he and his brother Calais would face no retribution. A trap was set: Phineus sat down to a meal with the Boreads standing guard, and as soon as he touched his food the Harpies swept down, devoured the food and flew off. The Boreads gave chase, pursuing the Harpies as far as the &quot;Floating Islands&quot; before Iris stopped them lest they kill the Harpies against the will of the gods. She swore an oath by the Styx that the Harpies would no longer harass Phineus, and the Boreads then turned back to return to the Argonauts. It is for this reason, according to Apollonius, that the &quot;Floating Islands&quot; are now called the Strophades, the &quot;Turning Islands&quot;. Phineus then revealed to the Argonauts the path their journey would take and informed them how to pass the Symplegades safely, thus partially filling the same role for Jason that Circe did for Odysseus in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

A now-lost play about Phineus, &quot;Phineus&quot;, was written by Aeschylus and was the first play in the trilogy that included &quot;The Persians&quot;, produced in 472 B.C. Eventually, Helios transformed Phineus into a mole, a blind creature, over some unspecific insult.

The story of Phineus and Cleopatra is briefly mentioned in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Aello (; , &quot;Aellō&quot; means &quot;storm&quot; or &quot;storm-swift&quot; in ancient Greek) was one of the Harpy sisters who would abduct people and torture them on their way to Tartarus.

== Other names ==
Aello was also referred to as:

*Aellopus (; Ἀελλόπους, &quot;Aellopous&quot;, &quot;whirlwind-footed&quot;)
*Aellope (; Αελλώπη, &quot;Aellōpē&quot;)
*Podarge (; Ποδάργη, &quot;Podargē&quot;, &quot;she who is foot-speedy&quot;)
*Podarce (; Ποδάρκη, &quot;Podarkē&quot;, &quot;she who is foot-safe&quot;?)
*Nicothoë (; Νικοθόη, &quot;Nikothoē&quot;, &quot;she who is victory-speedy&quot;)

== Family ==
As one of the Harpies, Aello was the daughter of the sea god Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra (also called Ozomene). Her harpy-sisters were Ocypete and Celaeno, whereas other mentioned siblings were Iris, and possibly Arke and Hydaspes. In other accounts, Harpies were called the progeny of Typhoeus, father of these monsters, or of Pontus (Sea) and Gaea (Earth) or of Poseidon, god of the sea.

Aello was claimed to be the mother of Achilles&#x27;s immortal steeds Balius and Xanthus by Zephyrus but some sources claimed it was really her sister Celaeno.
== Mythology ==
According to Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Aello was the harpy who was encountered by Aeneas&#x27; company in their wanderings after the fall of Troy:&quot;Wintry seas then tossed the heroic band, and in a treacherous harbor of those isles, called Strophades, Aello frightened them.&quot;

== Namesake ==
Aello was also the name of one of Actaeon&#x27;s dogs who destroyed their master when he was changed into a stag by the goddess of hunt, Artemis.

<text>In Greek mythology, Podarge () is a harpy, a personification of a swift wind and mate of Zephyrus, the West Wind. She is the mother of Balius and Xanthus — two divine horses renowned for their swiftness and who were gifted to Achilles, running as fast as the wind. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, she is described by Homer as having taken horse form, and &#x27;grazing in a meadow by the stream of Ocean&#x27;.

Some classical authors also regard her as Zephyrus&#x27; wife. However as the rainbow goddess Iris is his other wife and sister of Podarge, there is confusion between the two.

Stesichorus says the divine horses Phlogeus and Harpagos are the offspring of Podarge.

Her other names are &quot;Podarkes&quot;, &quot;Podarke-Aellopos&quot; and &quot;Podarces&quot;.

<text>Ocypete (Ancient Greek: Ὠκυπέτη means &#x27;swift wing&#x27;) was one of the three Harpies in Greek mythology. She was also known as Ocypode (Ὠκυπόδη means &quot;swift foot&quot;) or Ocythoe (Ὠκυθόη means &quot;swift runner&quot;). The Harpies were the daughters of the sea god Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra. Her harpy-sisters were Aello (Podarge) and Celaeno, whereas other mentioned siblings were Iris, and possibly Arke and Hydaspes. In other accounts, Harpies were called the progeny of Typhoeus, father of these monsters, or of Pontus (Sea) and Gaea (Earth) or of Poseidon, god of the sea.

== Mythology ==
According to one story, the Harpies were chased by the Boreads. Though the swiftest of the trio, Ocypete became exhausted, landed on an island in the middle of the ocean and begged for mercy from the gods. In Greek and Roman mythology, the Harpies were creatures employed by the higher gods to carry out punishments for crimes.

<text>The cougar (Puma concolor) (, &quot;&quot;), sometimes called the mountain lion, catamount, puma, or panther is a large small cat native to the Americas. It inhabits North, Central and South America, making it the most widely distributed wild, terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere, and one of the most widespread in the world. Its range spans the Yukon, British Columbia and Alberta provinces of Canada, the Rocky Mountains and areas in the western United States. Further south, its range extends through Mexico to the Amazon Rainforest and the southern Andes Mountains in Patagonia. It is an adaptable generalist species, occurring in most American habitat types. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking but also lives in open areas. 

The cougar is largely solitary. Its activity pattern varies from diurnality and cathemerality to crepuscularity and nocturnality between protected and non-protected areas, and is apparently correlated with the presence of other predators, prey species, livestock and humans. It is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey. Ungulates, particularly deer, are its primary prey, but it also hunts rodents. It is territorial and lives at low population densities. Individual home ranges depend on terrain, vegetation and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the dominant apex predator in its range, yielding prey to other predators. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare but increased in North America as more people entered cougar habitat and built farms.

The cougar is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Intensive hunting following European colonization of the Americas and ongoing human development into cougar habitat has caused populations to decline in most parts of its historical range. In particular, the eastern cougar population is considered to be mostly locally extinct in eastern North America since the early 20th century, with the exception of the isolated Florida panther subpopulation.

==Naming and etymology==
The cougar holds the Guinness record for the animal with the greatest number of names, with over 40 in English alone. The word &quot;cougar&quot; is borrowed from the Portuguese &quot;çuçuarana&quot;, via French; it was originally derived from the Tupi language. A current form in Brazil is &quot;suçuarana&quot;. In the 17th century, Georg Marcgrave named it &quot;cuguacu ara&quot;. Marcgrave&#x27;s rendering was reproduced in 1648 by his associate Willem Piso. &quot;Cuguacu ara&quot; was then adopted by John Ray in 1693. In 1774, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon converted &quot;cuguacu ara&quot; to &quot;cuguar&quot;, which was later modified to &quot;cougar&quot; in English.

The name &quot;puma&quot; is the common name used in Latin America and most parts of Europe and is occasionally used in the United States. The first use of &quot;puma&quot; in English dates to 1777, introduced from Spanish from the Quechua language. 

In the western United States and Canada, the name &quot;mountain lion&quot; is commonly used, first seen in writing in 1858.
The name &quot;catamount,&quot; a shortening of name &quot;cat of the mountain&quot;, has also been in English use for the cougar and other wild cats since at least 1664.
&quot;Panther&quot; is often used synonymously with &quot;cougar&quot;, &quot;puma&quot; or &quot;mountain lion&quot;.
The name &quot;painter&quot; is also sometimes used instead of &quot;panther&quot;, mostly in the southern United States.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
&quot;Felis concolor&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1771 for a cat with a long tail from Brazil. The specific epithet of the name, &quot;concolor&quot;, is Latin for &quot;of uniform color&quot;. It was placed in the genus &quot;Puma&quot; by William Jardine in 1834. This genus is part of the Felinae. The cougar is most closely related to the jaguarundi and the cheetah.

===Subspecies===
Following Linnaeus&#x27;s first scientific description of the cougar, 32 cougar zoological specimens were described and proposed as subspecies until the late 1980s. Genetic analysis of cougar mitochondrial DNA indicates that many of these are too similar to be recognized as distinct at a molecular level but that only six phylogeographic groups exist. The Florida panther samples showed a low microsatellite variation, possibly due to inbreeding. Following this research, the authors of &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; recognized the following six subspecies in 2005:

* &quot;P. c. concolor&quot; includes the synonyms &quot;bangsi&quot;, &quot;incarum&quot;, &quot;osgoodi&quot;, &quot;soasoaranna&quot;, &quot;sussuarana&quot;, &quot;soderstromii&quot;, &quot;suçuaçuara&quot;, and &quot;wavula&quot;
* &quot;P. c. puma&quot; includes the synonyms &quot;araucanus&quot;, &quot;concolor&quot;, &quot;patagonica&quot;, &quot;pearsoni&quot;, and &quot;puma&quot; 
* &quot;P. c. couguar&quot; includes &quot;arundivaga&quot;, &quot;aztecus&quot;, &quot;browni&quot;, &quot;californica&quot;, &quot;floridana&quot;, &quot;hippolestes&quot;, &quot;improcera&quot;, &quot;kaibabensis&quot;, &quot;mayensis&quot;, &quot;missoulensis&quot;, &quot;olympus&quot;, &quot;oregonensis&quot;, &quot;schorgeri&quot;, &quot;stanleyana&quot;, &quot;vancouverensis&quot;, and &quot;youngi&quot;
* &quot;P. c. costaricensis&quot; 
* &quot;P. c. anthonyi&quot; includes &quot;acrocodia&quot;, &quot;borbensis&quot;, &quot;capricornensis&quot;, &quot;concolor&quot;, &quot;greeni&quot;, and &quot;nigra&quot;
* &quot;P. c. cabrerae&quot; includes &quot;hudsonii&quot; and &quot;puma&quot; proposed by Marcelli in 1922
In 2006, the Florida panther was still referred to as a distinct subspecies &quot;P. c. coryi&quot; in research works.

, the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognizes only two subspecies as valid:
*&quot;P. c. concolor&quot; in South America, possibly excluding the region northwest of the Andes 
*&quot;P. c. couguar&quot; in North and Central America and possibly northwestern South America

===Evolution===
The family Felidae is believed to have originated in Asia about 11 million years ago (Mya). Taxonomic research on felids remains partial, and much of what is known about their evolutionary history is based on mitochondrial DNA analysis. Significant confidence intervals exist with suggested dates. In the latest genomic study of the Felidae, the common ancestor of today&#x27;s &quot;Leopardus&quot;, &quot;Lynx&quot;, &quot;Puma&quot;, &quot;Prionailurus&quot;, and &quot;Felis&quot; lineages migrated across the Bering land bridge into the Americas 8.0 to 8.5 million years ago. The lineages subsequently diverged in that order. North American felids then invaded South America 2–4Mya as part of the Great American Interchange, following the formation of the Isthmus of Panama.

The cheetah lineage is suggested by some studies to have diverged from the &quot;Puma&quot; lineage in the Americas and migrated back to Asia and Africa, while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the Old World itself. A high level of genetic similarity has been found among North American cougar populations, suggesting they are all fairly recent descendants of a small ancestral group. Culver et al. propose the original North American cougar population was extirpated during the Pleistocene extinctions some 10,000 years ago, when other large mammals, such as &quot;Smilodon&quot;, also disappeared. North America was then repopulated by South American cougars.

A coprolite identified as from a cougar was excavated in Argentina&#x27;s Catamarca Province and dated to 17,002–16,573 years old. It contained &quot;Toxascaris leonina&quot; eggs. This finding indicates that the cougar and the parasite have existed in South America since at least the Late Pleistocene. The oldest fossil record of a cougar (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) in South America (Argentina) is a partial skull from the late Calabrian (Ensenadan) age.

==Characteristics==
The head of the cougar is round, and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has four retractile claws on its hind paws and five on its forepaws, of which one is a dewclaw. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations for clutching prey.

Cougars are slender and agile members of the Felidae. They are the fourth largest cat species worldwide; adults stand about tall at the shoulders. Adult males are around long from nose to tail tip, and females average , with overall ranges between nose to tail suggested for the species in general. Of this length, the tail typically accounts for . Males generally weigh . Females typically weigh between . Cougar size is smallest close to the equator and larger towards the poles. The largest recorded cougar, shot in 1901, weighed ; claims of and have been reported, though they were probably exaggerated. Male cougars in North America average , while the average female in the same region averages about . On average, adult male cougars in British Columbia weigh and adult females , though several male cougars in British Columbia weighed between .

Depending on the locality, cougars can be smaller or bigger than jaguars but are less muscular and not as powerfully built, so on average, their weight is less. Whereas the size of cougars tends to increase as much as distance from the equator increases, which crosses the northern portion of South America, jaguars are generally smaller north of the Amazon River in South America and larger south of it. For example, while South American jaguars are comparatively large, and may exceed , North American jaguars in Mexico&#x27;s Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve weigh approximately , about the same as female cougars.

Cougar coloring is plain (hence the Latin &quot;concolor&quot; [&quot;one color&quot;] in the scientific name) but can vary greatly across individuals and even siblings. The coat is typically tawny, but it ranges from silvery-grey to reddish with lighter patches on the underbody, including the jaws, chin, and throat. Infants are spotted and born with blue eyes and rings on their tails; juveniles are pale, and dark spots remain on their flanks. A leucistic individual was seen in Serra dos Órgãos National Park in Rio de Janeiro in 2013 when it was recorded by a camera trap, indicating that pure white individuals do exist within the species, though they are extremely rare. 

The cougar has large paws and proportionally the largest hind legs in the Felidae, allowing for great leaping and powerful short sprints. It can leap from the ground up to high into a tree.

==Distribution and habitat==
The cougar has the most extensive range of any wild land animal in the Americas, spanning 110 degrees of latitude from the Yukon in Canada to the southern Andes in Chile. The species was extirpated from eastern North America, aside from Florida, but they may be recolonizing their former range and isolated populations have been documented east of their contemporary ranges in both the Midwestern US and Canada.

The cougar lives in all forest types, lowland and mountainous deserts, and in open areas with little vegetation up to an elevation of . In the Santa Ana Mountains, it prefers steep canyons, escarpments, rim rocks and dense brush. In Mexico, it was recorded in the Sierra de San Carlos. In the Yucatán Peninsula, it inhabits secondary and semi-deciduous forests in El Eden Ecological Reserve. In El Salvador, it was recorded in the lower montane forest in Montecristo National Park and in a river basin in the Morazán Department above in 2019.
In Colombia, it was recorded in a palm oil plantation close to a riparian forest in the Llanos Basin, and close to water bodies in the Magdalena River Valley.
In the human-modified landscape of central Argentina, it inhabits bushland with abundant vegetation cover and prey species.

==Behavior and ecology==
Cougars are an important keystone species in Western Hemisphere ecosystems, linking numerous species at many trophic levels. In a comprehensive literature review of more than 160 studies on cougar ecology, ecological interactions with 485 other species in cougar-inhabited ecosystems have been shown to involve different areas of interaction, ranging from the use of other species as food sources and prey, fear effects on potential prey, effects from carcass remains left behind, to competitive effects on other predator species in shared habitat. The most common research topic in the literature used here was the cougar&#x27;s diet and its prey&#x27;s regulation.

===Hunting and diet===

The cougar is a generalist hypercarnivore. It prefers large mammals such as mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, moose, mountain goat and bighorn sheep. It opportunistically takes smaller prey such as rodents, lagomorphs, smaller carnivores, birds, and even domestic animals, including pets. The mean weight of cougar vertebrate prey increases with its body weight and is lower in areas closer to the equator. A survey of North America research found 68% of prey items were ungulates, especially deer. Only the Florida panther showed variation, often preferring feral hogs and armadillos. Cougars have been known to prey on introduced gemsbok populations in New Mexico. One individual cougar was recorded as hunting 29 gemsbok, which made up 58% of its recorded kills. Most gemsbok kills were neonates, but some adults were also known to have been taken. Elsewhere in the southwestern United States, they have been recorded to also prey on feral horses in the Great Basin, as well as feral donkeys in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts.

Investigations at Yellowstone National Park showed that elk and mule deer were the cougar&#x27;s primary prey; the prey base is shared with the park&#x27;s wolves, with which the cougar competes for resources. A study on winter kills from November to April in Alberta showed that ungulates accounted for greater than 99% of the cougar diet. Learned, individual prey recognition was observed, as some cougars rarely killed bighorn sheep, while others relied heavily on the species.

In the Central and South American cougar range area, the ratio of deer in the diet declines. Small to mid-sized mammals, including large rodents such as the capybara, are preferred. Ungulates accounted for only 35% of prey items in one survey, about half that of North America. Competition with the larger jaguar in South America has been suggested for the decline in the size of prey items. In Central or North America, the cougar and jaguar share the same prey, depending on its abundance. Other listed prey species of the cougar include mice, porcupines, American beavers, raccoons, hares, guanacoes, peccaries, vicuñas, rheas and wild turkeys. Birds and small reptiles are sometimes preyed upon in the south, but this is rarely recorded in North America. Magellanic penguins (&quot;Spheniscus magellanicus&quot;) constitute the majority of prey items in cougar diet in Patagonia&#x27;s Bosques Petrificados de Jaramillo National Park and Monte León National Park.

Although capable of sprinting, the cougar is typically an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap onto the back of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar can break the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. Kills are generally estimated around one large ungulate every two weeks. The period shrinks for females raising young, and may be as short as one kill every three days when cubs are nearly mature around 15 months. The cat drags a kill to a preferred spot, covers it with brush, and returns to feed over a period of days. The cougar is generally reported to not be a scavenger, but deer carcasses left exposed for study were scavenged by cougars in California, suggesting more opportunistic behavior.

===Interactions with other predators===
Aside from humans, no species preys upon mature cougars in the wild, although conflicts with other predators or scavengers occur. Of the large predators in Yellowstone National Park – the grizzly and black bears, gray wolf and cougar – the massive grizzly bear appears dominant, often (though not always) able to drive a gray wolf pack, black bear or cougar off their kills. One study found that grizzlies and American black bears visited 24% of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of carcasses. Bears gained up to 113%, and cougars lost up to 26% of their daily energy requirements from these encounters. In Colorado and California, black bears were found to visit 48% and 77% of kills, respectively. In general, cougars are subordinate to black bears when it comes to killing, and when bears are most active, the cats take prey more frequently and spend less time feeding on each kill. Unlike several subordinate predators from other ecosystems, cougars do not appear to exploit spatial or temporal refuges to avoid competitors.

The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey, mostly in winter. Packs of wolves can steal cougars&#x27; kills, and there are some documented cases of cougars being killed by them. One report describes a large pack of seven to 11 wolves killing a female cougar and her kittens, while in nearby Sun Valley, Idaho, a 2-year-old male cougar was found dead, apparently killed by a wolf pack. Conversely, one-to-one confrontations tend to be dominated by the cat, and there are various documented accounts where wolves have been ambushed and killed, including adult male specimens. Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities, and disrupting the feline&#x27;s behavior. Preliminary research in Yellowstone, for instance, has shown displacement of the cougar by wolves. One researcher in Oregon noted: &quot;When there is a pack around, cougars are not comfortable around their kills or raising kittens [...] A lot of times a big cougar will kill a wolf, but the pack phenomenon changes the table.&quot; Both species are capable of killing mid-sized predators, such as bobcats, Canada lynxes, wolverines and coyotes, and tend to suppress their numbers. Although cougars can kill coyotes, the latter have been documented attempting to prey on cougar cubs.

The cougar and jaguar share overlapping territory in the southern portion of its range. The jaguar tends to take the larger prey where ranges overlap, reducing both the cougar&#x27;s potential size and the likelihood of direct competition between the two cats. Cougars appear better than jaguars at exploiting a broader prey niche and smaller prey.

===Social spacing and interactions===
The cougar is a mostly solitary animal. Only mothers and kittens live in groups, with adults meeting rarely. While generally loners, cougars will reciprocally share kills and seem to organize themselves into small communities defined by the territories of dominant males. Cats within these areas socialize more frequently with each other than with outsiders.

In the vicinity of a cattle ranch in northern Mexico, cougars exhibited nocturnal activity that overlapped foremost with the activity of calves. In a nature reserve in central Mexico, the activity of cougars was crepuscular and nocturnal, overlapping largely with the activity of the nine-banded armadillo (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;). Cougars in the montane Abra-Tanchipa Biosphere Reserve in southeastern Mexico displayed a cathemeral activity pattern. Data from 12 years of camera trapping in the Pacific slope and Talamanca Cordillera of Costa Rica showed cougars as cathemeral. Both cougars and jaguars in the Cockscomb Basin of Belize were nocturnal but avoided each other. In a protected cloud forest in the central Andes of Colombia, cougars were active from late afternoon to shortly before sunrise and sometimes during noon and early afternoon. In protected areas of the Madidi-Tambopata Landscape in Bolivia and Peru, cougars were active throughout the day but with a tendency to nocturnal activity that overlapped with the activity of main prey species. During an 8-year-long study in a modified landscape in southeastern Brazil, male cougars were primarily nocturnal, but females were active at night and day. Cougars were diurnal in the Brazilian Pantanal, but crepuscular and nocturnal in protected areas in the Cerrado, Caatinga and ecotone biomes. Cougars in the Atlantic Forest were active throughout the day but displayed peak activity during early mornings in protected areas and crepuscular and nocturnal activity in less protected areas. In central Argentina, cougars were active day and night in protected areas but were active immediately after sunset and before sunrise outside protected areas. Cougars displayed a foremost crepuscular and nocturnal activity pattern in a ranching area in southern Argentina.

Home range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain, vegetation, and prey abundance. Research suggests a lower limit of and upper limit of of home range for males. Large male home ranges of with female ranges half that size. One female adjacent to the San Andres Mountains was found with a big range of , necessitated by poor prey abundance. Research has shown cougar abundances from 0.5 animals to as many as seven per .

Male home ranges include or overlap with females but, at least where studied, not with those of other males. The home ranges of females overlap slightly. Males create scrapes composed of leaves and duff with their hind feet, and mark them with urine and sometimes feces. When males encounter each other, they vocalize and may engage in violent conflict if neither backs down.

Cougars communicate with various vocalizations. Aggressive sounds include growls, spits, snarls, and hisses. During the mating season, estrus females produce caterwauls or yowls to attract mates, and males respond with similar vocals. Mothers and offspring keep in contact with whistles, chirps, and mews.

===Reproduction and life cycle===
Females reach sexual maturity at the age of 18 months to three years and are in estrus for about eight days of a 23-day cycle; the gestation period is approximately 91 days. Both adult males and females may mate with multiple partners, and a female&#x27;s litter can have multiple paternities. Copulation is brief but frequent. Chronic stress can result in low reproductive rates in captivity as well as in the field.

Gestation is 82–103 days long. Only females are involved in parenting. Litter size is between one and six cubs, typically two. Caves and other alcoves that offer protection are used as litter dens. Born blind, cubs are completely dependent on their mother at first and begin to be weaned at around three months of age. As they grow, they go out on forays with their mother, first visiting kill sites and, after six months, beginning to hunt small prey on their own. Kitten survival rates are just over one per litter.

Juveniles remain with their mothers for one to two years. When a female reaches estrous again, her offspring must disperse or the male will kill them. Males tend to disperse further than females. One study has shown a high mortality rate among cougars that travel farthest from their maternal range, often due to conflicts with other cougars. In a study area in New Mexico, males dispersed farther than females, traversed large expanses of non-cougar habitat and were probably most responsible for nuclear gene flow between habitat patches.

Life expectancy in the wild is reported at 8 to 13 years and probably averages 8 to 10; a female of at least 18 years was reported killed by hunters on Vancouver Island. Cougars may live as long as 20 years in captivity. Causes of death in the wild include disability and disease, competition with other cougars, starvation, accidents, and, where allowed, hunting. The feline immunodeficiency virus is well-adapted to the cougar.

==Conservation==
The cougar has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2008. However, it is also listed on CITES Appendix II. Hunting it is prohibited in California, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and most of Argentina. Hunting is regulated in Canada, Mexico, Peru, and the United States. Establishing wildlife corridors and protecting sufficient range areas are critical for the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations showed that it faces a low extinction risk in areas larger than . Between one and four new individuals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, thus highlighting the importance of habitat corridors.

The Florida panther population is afforded protection under the Endangered Species Act. The Texas Mountain Lion Conservation Project was launched in 2009 and aimed at raising local people&#x27;s awareness of the status and ecological role of the cougar and mitigating conflict between landowners and cougars.

The cougar is threatened by habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and depletion of its prey base due to poaching. Hunting is legal in the western United States. In Florida, heavy traffic causes frequent accidents involving cougars. Highways are a major barrier to the dispersal of cougars. The cougar populations in California are becoming fragmented with the increase in human population and infrastructure growth in the state.

Human–wildlife conflict in proximity of of cougar habitat is pronounced in areas with a median human density of and a median livestock population density of . Conflict is generally lower in areas more than away from roads and away from settlements.

==Relationships with humans==
===Attacks on humans===
====In North America====

Due to the expanding human population, cougar ranges increasingly overlap with areas inhabited by humans. Attacks on humans are very rare, as cougar prey recognition is a learned behavior and they do not generally recognize humans as prey. In a 10-year study in New Mexico of wild cougars who were not habituated to humans, the animals did not exhibit threatening behavior to researchers who approached closely (median distance=18.5 m; 61 feet) except in 6% of cases; of those were females with cubs. Attacks on people, livestock, and pets may occur when a puma habituates to humans or is in a condition of severe starvation. Attacks are most frequent during late spring and summer when juvenile cougars leave their mothers and search for new territory.

Between 1890 and 1990 in North America, there were 53 reported, confirmed attacks on humans, resulting in 48 nonfatal injuries and 10 deaths of humans (the total is greater than 53 because some attacks had more than one victim). By 2004, the count had climbed to 88 attacks and 20 deaths.

Within North America, the distribution of attacks is not uniform. The heavily populated state of California saw a dozen attacks from 1986 to 2004 (after just three from 1890 to 1985), including three fatalities. In March 2024, two brothers in California were attacked by a male cougar, with one being fatally wounded; it was the state&#x27;s first fatal attack in 20 years. Washington state was the site of a fatal attack in 2018, its first since 1924. Lightly populated New Mexico reported an attack in 2008, the first there since 1974.

As with many predators, a cougar may attack if cornered, if a fleeing human stimulates their instinct to chase, or if a person &quot;&quot;. Standing still may cause the cougar to consider a person easy prey. Exaggerating the threat to the animal through intense eye contact, loud shouting, and any other action to appear larger and more menacing, may make the animal retreat. Fighting back with sticks and rocks, or even bare hands, is often effective in persuading an attacking cougar to disengage.

When cougars do attack, they usually employ their characteristic neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae and into the spinal cord. Neck, head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal. Children are at greatest risk of attack and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks before 1991 showed that 64% of all victims – and almost all fatalities – were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in British Columbia, particularly on Vancouver Island, where cougar populations are especially dense. Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, such as activity during daylight hours, a lack of fear of humans, and stalking humans. There have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people.

Research on new wildlife collars may reduce human-animal conflicts by predicting when and where predatory animals hunt. This may save the lives of humans, pets, and livestock, as well as the lives of these large predatory mammals that are important to the balance of ecosystems.

====In South America====
Cougars in the southern cone of South America are reputed to be extremely reluctant to attack people; in legend, they defended people against jaguars. The nineteenth-century naturalists Félix de Azara and William Henry Hudson thought that attacks on people, even children or sleeping adults, did not happen. Hudson, citing anecdotal evidence from hunters, claimed that pumas were positively inhibited from attacking people, even in self-defense. Attacks on humans, although exceedingly rare, have occurred.

An early, authenticated, non-fatal case occurred near Lake Viedma, Patagonia, in 1877 when a female mauled the Argentine scientist Francisco P. Moreno; Moreno afterward showed the scars to Theodore Roosevelt. In this instance, however, Moreno had been wearing a guanaco-hide poncho round his neck and head as protection against the cold; in Patagonia the guanaco is the puma&#x27;s chief prey animal. Another authenticated case occurred in 1997 in Iguazú National Park in northeastern Argentina, when the 20-month-old son of a ranger was killed by a female puma. Forensic analysis found specimens of the child&#x27;s hair and clothing fibers in the animal&#x27;s stomach. The coatí is the puma&#x27;s chief prey in this area. Despite prohibitory signs, coatis are hand-fed by tourists in the park, causing unnatural approximation between cougars and humans. This particular puma had been raised in captivity and released into the wild. On March 13, 2012, Erica Cruz, a 23-year-old shepherdess was found dead in a mountainous area near Rosario de Lerma, Salta Province, in northwestern Argentina. Claw incisions, which severed a jugular vein, indicated that the attacker was a felid; differential diagnosis ruled out other possible perpetrators. There were no bite marks on the victim, who had been herding goats. In 2019 in Córdoba Province, Argentina an elderly man was badly injured by a cougar after he attempted to defend his dog from it, while in neighboring Chile a 28-year-old woman was attacked and killed in Corral, in Los Ríos Region, on October 20, 2020.

Fatal attacks by other carnivores, such as feral dogs, can be misattributed to cougars without appropriate forensic knowledge.

===Predation on domestic animals===
During the early years of ranching, cougars were considered on par with wolves in destructiveness. According to figures in Texas in 1990, 86 calves (0.0006% of Texas&#x27;s 13.4 million cattle and calves), 253 mohair goats, 302 mohair kids, 445 sheep (0.02% of Texas&#x27;s 2 million sheep and lambs) and 562 lambs (0.04% of Texas&#x27;s 1.2 million lambs) were confirmed to have been killed by cougars that year. In Nevada in 1992, cougars were confirmed to have killed nine calves, one horse, four foals, five goats, 318 sheep, and 400 lambs. In both reports, sheep were the most frequently attacked. Some instances of surplus killing have resulted in the deaths of 20 sheep in one attack. A cougar&#x27;s killing bite is applied to the back of the neck, head, or throat and the cat inflicts puncture marks with its claws usually seen on the sides and underside of the prey, sometimes also shredding the prey as it holds on. Coyotes also typically bite the throat, but the work of a cougar is generally clean, while bites inflicted by coyotes and dogs leave ragged edges. The size of the tooth puncture marks also helps distinguish kills made by cougars from those made by smaller predators.

Remedial hunting appears to have the paradoxical effect of increased livestock predation and complaints of human-cougar conflicts. In a 2013 study, the most important predictor of cougar problems was the remedial hunting of cougars the previous year. Each additional cougar on the landscape increased predation and human-cougar complaints by 5%, but each animal killed during the previous year increased complaints by 50%. The effect had a dose-response relationship with very heavy (100% removal of adult cougars) remedial hunting, leading to a 150–340% increase in livestock and human conflicts. This effect is attributed to the removal of older cougars that have learned to avoid people and their replacement by younger males that react differently to humans. Remedial hunting enables younger males to enter the former territories of the older animals. Predation by cougars on dogs &quot;is widespread, but occurs at low frequencies&quot;.

===In mythology===
The grace and power of the cougar have been widely admired in the cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. The Inca city of Cusco is reported to have been designed in the shape of a cougar, and the animal also gave its name to both Inca regions and people. The Moche people often represented the cougar in their ceramics. The sky and thunder god of the Inca, Viracocha, has been associated with the animal.

In North America, mythological descriptions of the cougar have appeared in the stories of the Hocąk language (&quot;Ho-Chunk&quot; or &quot;Winnebago&quot;) of Wisconsin and Illinois and the Cheyenne, among others. To the Apache and Walapai of the Southwestern United States, the wail of the cougar was a harbinger of death. The Algonquins and Ojibwe believe that the cougar lived in the underworld and was wicked, whereas it was a sacred animal among the Cherokee.

<text>In Greek mythology and religion, Zephyrus (), also spelled in English as Zephyr, is the god and personification of the West wind, one of the several wind gods, the Anemoi. The son of Eos (the goddess of the dawn) and Astraeus, Zephyrus is the most gentle and favourable of the winds, associated with flowers, springtime and even procreation. In myths, he is presented as the tender breeze, known for his unrequited love for the Spartan prince Hyacinthus. Alongside Boreas, the two are the most prominent wind gods with relatively limited roles in recorded mythology.

Zephyrus, similarly to his brothers, received a cult during ancient times although his worship was minor compared to the Twelve Olympians. Still, traces of it are found in Classical Athens and surrounding regions and city-states, where it was usually joint with the cults of the other wind gods.

His equivalent in Roman mythology is the god Favonius.

== Etymology ==
The ancient Greek noun is the word for the wind that blows from the west. His name is attested in Mycenaean Greek as ze-pu2-ro (Linear B: ), which points to a possible Proto-Hellenic form &quot;*Dzépʰuros&quot;. Further attestation of the god and his worship as part of the Anemoi is found in the word-forms , , , . That is, &quot;priestess of the winds&quot;, found on the KN Fp 1 and KN Fp 13 tablets.

Traditionally, &#x27;Zephyros&#x27; has been linked to the word (zóphos) meaning &quot;darkness&quot; or &quot;west&quot;. Both in turn have been connected to the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*(h₃)yebʰ-&quot;, meaning &quot;to enter, to penetrate&quot; (from which (oíphō), meaning &#x27;to have sex&#x27;, also derives). It has been noted however that a development &quot;*Hi̯-&quot; → &quot;ζ-&quot; is unlikely, and most evidence in fact points to the contrary.

It could also be of pre-Greek origin, though Beekes is not sure either way. Due to his role as the west wind, his name and various derivatives of it were used to mean &#x27;western&#x27;, for example the Greek colony of Locri Epizephyrii in southern Italy, west of Greece.

== Family ==
=== Parents ===
Zephyrus, like the rest of the wind gods Anemoi (Boreas, Eurus and Notus) was said to be the son of Eos, goddess of the dawn, by her husband and first cousin Astraeus, a minor god related to the stars. The poet Ovid dubs the four of them &#x27;the Astraean brothers&#x27; in reference to their paternity.

He is thus brother to the rest of Eos and Astraeus&#x27;s children, namely the five star-gods and the justice goddess Astraea. His mortal half-brothers include Memnon and Emathion, sons of his mother Eos by the Trojan prince Tithonus. The Athenian playwright Aeschylus in his fifth-century BC play &quot;Agamemnon&quot; writes that Zephyrus is the son of the goddess Gaia (the mother earth). The father, if one exists at all, is not named.

=== Consorts and offspring ===
In Greek tradition, Zephyrus became the consort of Iris, the goddess of the rainbow and messenger of the gods. According to Nonnus, a late-antiquity poet, together they became the parents of Pothos, the god of desire, and according to Alcaeus of Mytilene (a six-century BC poet from the island of Lesbos), of Eros as well, though he is more commonly a son of Ares and Aphrodite. In the same passage, Zephyrus is described as having golden hair.

By the Harpy Podarge (who is Iris&#x27;s sister) he became the father of Balius and Xanthus, the two fast, talking horses that were given to Achilles, when he mated with her while she was grazing on a meadow near the banks of the Ocean, implied in the form of a mare. Quintus Smyrnaeus also says that by a Harpy he had Arion, the talking horse. Like with the case of Eros, Arion&#x27;s more common parentage is different, in this case the Olympians Demeter and Poseidon.

In some sources Zephyrus has a son named Carpus (&quot;fruit&quot;) by a nymph Hora, who drowned in the Maeander river when the wind drove a wave right into his face, driving his lover Calamus into despair, who went on to take his life. According to Pseudo-Oppian, he also became the genitor of tigers by an unnamed consort.

== Mythology ==
=== West Wind ===
Zephyrus, along with his brother Boreas, is one of the most prominent of the Anemoi; they are frequently mentioned together by poets, and along with a third brother, Notus (the south wind) they were seen as the three useful and favourable winds (the east wind, Eurus, seen as bad omen). They are the three wind gods mentioned by Hesiod, as ancient Greeks avoided talking about Eurus. Zephyrus and Boreas were thought to dwell together in a palace in Thrace.

In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; however, they all seem to dwell on the island of Aeolia, as Zeus has tasked Aeolus with the job of the keeper of the winds. Aeolus receives Odysseus and his wretched crew, and hosts them for a month gracefully. As they part, Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag containing all the winds, except for Zephyrus himself, who is let free to blow Odysseus&#x27;s ship gently back to Ithaca; Odysseus&#x27;s crewmates foolishly open the bag, thinking it to contain treasure, and set free all the other winds, blowing the ships back to Aeolia. Many years later, right after Odysseus left Calypso, the sea-god Poseidon in rage unleashed all four of them to cause a storm and raise great waves in order to drown Odysseus in the sea.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Zephyrus is visited by his wife Iris in his home as he dines with his wind brothers. He wishes to summon him and Boreas to blow on Patroclus&#x27;s funeral pyre following his death, as Achilles prayed for their help when the pyre failed to kindle. In the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, all four live together with their father Astraeus; Zephyrus plays sweet notes with an aulos for Demeter when she pays them a visit. 

In the myth of Eros and Psyche, Zephyrus serves Eros, the god of love, by transporting his bride-to-be, the mortal princess Psyche with his soft breeze from the cliff (where she had been left in an oracle&#x27;s suggestion) to Eros&#x27;s palace. Later, he also helps rather reluctantly Psyche&#x27;s two sisters transport the same way to the palace as well, when Psyche wishes to see them again. After Eros abandons Psyche over her betrayal, both sisters take advantage of the situation and each independently goes to the cliff (having both been lied to by Psyche that Eros wished to maker her his new wife), calling for Eros to make them his bride, and Zephyrus to take them to the palace. But this time Zephyrus does not act when they jump, and thus they both fall to their deaths, torn limb to limb and made food for the birds of prey and wild beasts below.

Zephyrus seems to have had a connection to swans; in Philostratus the Elder&#x27;s works, he joins them twice in their song, once while they are carrying the Erotes and another when the young Phaethon is killed driving his father Helios&#x27;s fiery chariot. This apparently symbolizes the belief that swans took to singing when the mild west wind blew.

=== Other myths ===
In his most notable myth, Zephyrus fell in love with a beautiful Spartan prince named Hyacinthus, who nevertheless rejected him and became the lover of another god, Apollo. One day when the prince and Apollo were playing at discus-throwing, Zephyrus deflected the course of Apollo&#x27;s discus, redirecting it right onto Hyacinthus&#x27;s head and fatally wounding him. Hyacinthus&#x27;s is blood then became a new flower, the hyacinth. In some versions, Zephyrus is supplanted by his brother Boreas as the wind-god who bore a one-sided love for the beautiful prince. Zephyrus&#x27;s role in this myth reflects his connection to flowers and springtime as the gentle west wind, who, in spite of his traditional gentleness, is nonetheless a harsh lover, like all the winds. Not every version of this tale features Zephyrus, however, and his participation is a secondary narrative; in many of them he is absent, and Hyacinthus&#x27;s death stems from a genuine accident on Apollo&#x27;s part.

On another occasion, another beautiful youth named Cyparissus (&quot;cypress&quot;) and Zephyrus became lovers. The youth, wanting to preserve his beauty, fled to Mount Cassium in Syria, where he became transformed into a cypress tree. This myth, which might be of Hellenistic origin, seems to have been modeled after that of Apollo and Daphne. It also, along with Zephyrus&#x27;s role in Hyacinthus&#x27;s story, fits the pattern–also fit by his brother Boreas–of a wind god appearing in the story of the origin of a plant. In all other narratives, however, Zephyrus is absent, and the role of Cyparissus&#x27;s divine partner is filled by Apollo; furthermore, Cyparissus is transformed into a cypress by Apollo at his own request after accidentally killing his own pet deer, which caused him much sorrow.

Zephyrus also features in some of the dialogues by the satirical author Lucian of Samosata; in the &quot;Dialogues of the Sea Gods&quot;, he appears in two dialogues with his brother Notus, the god of the south wind. In the first, they discuss the Argive princess Io and how she was loved and got turned into a heifer by Zeus in order to hide from his jealous wife Hera, while in the second, Zephyrus enthusiastically recounts the scene he has just witnessed of how Zeus transformed into a bull, tricked another princess, the Phoenician Europa, into riding him, transported her to Crete and then mated with her while Notus expresses his jealousy and complains of seeing nothing noteworthy.

== In ancient culture ==
=== Iconography ===
Like all the other wind gods, Zephyrus is represented in ancient Greek art with wings, due to which he is sometimes hard to distinguish from Eros, another winged youthful god, though tellingly unlike Zephyrus Eros is not depicted pursuing males. In ancient vases, he is most commonly pursuing the young Hyacinthus or already holding him in his arms in an erotic and sexual manner; on a red-figure vase in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Zephyrus&#x27;s erect penis thrusts into the folds of the young man&#x27;s clothes as they fly together, while vase 95.31 from the same museum depicts intercrural sex between the two. Various other vases also show scenes of Zephyrus grabbing and seizing Hyacinthus.

On the Tower of the Winds, a clocktower/horologion in the Roman agora of Athens, the frieze depicts Zephyrus alongside seven more of the wind gods above the sundials. Zephyrus is presented as a beardless youth carrying a cloak full of flowers.

On the Pergamon Altar, which depicts the battle of the gods against the Giants (known as the Gigantomachy), Zephyrus and the other three wind gods are shown in the shape of horses who pull the chariot of the goddess Hera in the eastern frieze of the monument; the equine forms of the Anemoi are also found in Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27;s works, where the four brothers pull Zeus&#x27;s chariot instead.

=== Cult ===
Ancient cult of the wind gods is attested in several ancient Greek states. According to the geographer Pausanias, the Winds were jointly worshipped in the town of Titane, in Sicyon, where the local priest offered sacrifice to them, and in Coronea, a town in Boeotia. It is also known that the citizens of Laciadae in Attica had erected an altar for Zephyrus. According to a fragment doubtfully attributed to the fifth-century BC poet Bacchylides, a Rhodian farmer named Eudemus built a temple in honour of the west wind god, in gratitude for his help.

== Favonius ==
Zephyrus&#x27;s Roman equivalent was called Favonius (the &quot;favouring&quot;) who held dominion over plants and flowers, however &#x27;Zephyrus&#x27; was also commonly used by Romans. Some later authors would also describe him as having wings in his head. The Roman poet Horace writes:

Unlike Greek authors, Roman writers held that Zephyrus/Favonius married not Iris but rather a local vegetation and fertility goddess named Flora (identified and linked by Ovid with a minor Greek nymph named Chloris and her legend) after abducting her while she tried to run away and escape him; he gave her dominion over flowers, thus making amends for his violence and abduction of her.

Some analysts have suggested that Carpus, the son Zephyrus had by Hora/a Hora (season goddess), is supposed to have been actually mothered by Flora/Chloris instead, although this is not confirmed in any ancient text.

<text>In Greek mythology, Astraeus () or Astraios () is an astrological god. Some also associate him with the winds, as he is the father of the four Anemoi (wind deities), by his wife, the dawn-goddess Eos.

== Etymology ==
His name &quot;Astraeus&quot; (Ancient Greek , translit. &quot;Astraîos&quot;) is derived from the Greek word (&quot;astḗr&quot;) &quot;star&quot;. itself is inherited from the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;*h₂ster-&quot; &quot;star&quot;, from &quot;*h₂eh₁s-&quot; &quot;to burn&quot;. &quot;Astraea&quot;, the name of his daughter, shares this same etymology.

==Mythology==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; and &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Astraeus is a second-generation Titan descended from Crius and Eurybia. However, Hyginus wrote that he was descended directly from Tartarus and Gaia and referred to him as one of the Gigantes. Servius, perhaps conflating him with the Giant like Hyginus did, wrote that he took arms and fought against the gods.

Astraeus married Eos, the goddess of the dawn. Together as nightfall and daybreak, they produced many children associated with what occurs in the sky during twilight.

In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Astraeus and Eos produce the winds—namely Zephyrus, Boreas, and Notus—as well as Eosphorus and the stars. A few sources mention another daughter, Astraea, the goddess of innocence and, occasionally, justice.

He is also sometimes associated with Aeolus, the Keeper of the Winds, since winds often increase around dusk.

In Nonnus&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, Astraeus is presented as an oracular god whom the goddess Demeter visits, concerned about her daughter Persephone&#x27;s future as she had started to attract a significant number of admirers on Olympus and worried that she might end up marrying Hephaestus. Astraeus then warned her that soon enough, Persephone would be ravished by a serpent and bear fruit from that union, which greatly upset Demeter.

<doc id="78168" wikidata="Q836518" url="?curid=78168" title="Eurus">
<text>In Greek mythology and religion, Eurus () is the god and personification of the east wind, although sometimes he is also said to be southeast specifically. He is one of the four principal wind gods, the Anemoi, alongside Boreas (north wind), Zephyrus (west wind) and Notus (south wind). Eurus is featured rarely in ancient literature and art, appearing together with his three brothers as part of a whole if at all, and virtually has no individual mythology of his own. Often he is excluded from the group entirely, leaving Boreas, Zephyrus and Notus to represent the Anemoi. His Roman equivalent is the god Vulturnus.

== Etymology ==
The ancient Greek noun (&quot;eûros&quot;) refers to the wind that blows from the east. Its ultimate etymology is not clear, although it has been variously connected to the Greek words for the dawn (, &quot;ēṓs&quot;) and aura (, &quot;aúra&quot;).

== Attributes and family ==
Eurus is traditionally the god of the east or south-east wind. He has been both described as rain-bringing and a dry type of wind.

Eurus, unlike the three other principal wind gods, is often skipped by ancient authors. He is the only one not to be mentioned by Hesiod at all, who makes the three beneficial winds the children of Eos (the dawn goddess) and her husband Astraeus, and says that all the other, non-beneficial for humanity winds are the sons of Typhon. Instead of Eurus, Hesiod only speaks of &quot;Argestes&quot; for the fourth, which could also refer to Apeliotes occasionally (the god of the southeast wind). Similarly, he is the only one among the four who does not have an &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; sang in his honour.

It is thus Nonnus, a fifth-century AD author from Panopolis who made Eurus one of the children of Eos and Astraeus in his &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;.

== Mythology ==
In his few appearances in mythology, Eurus is usually paired with Notus, the south wind, like Zephyrus is paired with Boreas. Like Notus and unlike Zephyrus/Boreas, Eurus has little to no mythology of his own, and only appears as part of a whole when the Anemoi feature in some tale. Eurus has no known wife, lovers or children.

=== &quot;Odyssey&quot; ===
According to the &quot;Odyssey&quot; the winds seem to dwell on the island of Aeolia, as Zeus has made Aeolus the keeper of the winds. Aeolus receives Odysseus and his crew warmly, and keeps them as guests for a month. As they part, Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag containing all the winds, except for the gentle Zephyrus who blows them back home. Although warned not to open the bag under any circumstances, Odysseus&#x27;s crewmates however foolishly open the bag, thinking it to contain some treasure, and set free Eurus along with all the other winds as well, who then blow the ships back to Aeolia, whereupon Aeolus refused to help them a second time.

Some time later, he and Notus strand Odysseus on Thrinacia, the island of the sun-god Helios, for an entire month, following their departure from the island of Circe. After Odysseus left Calypso, the sea-god Poseidon in anger let loose all four of them, Eurus included, to cause a storm and raise great waves in order to drown him.

=== Other appearances ===
In the &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, he and his confirmed brothers live with their father Astraeus; Eurus serves nectar in cups when Demeter pays the family a visit. 

In the Pergamon Altar, which depicts the battle of the gods against the Giants, Eurus and the other three wind gods are shown in the shape of horses who pull Hera&#x27;s chariot; traces of their equine form are also found in Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27;s works, where they pull Zeus&#x27;s chariot instead.

== Cult ==
Early attestation of Eurus and wind-related worship is found in the Mycenaean Greek words (Linear B: ) and (Linear B: ), that is, &quot;priestess of the winds&quot;, found on the KN Fp 1 and KN Fp 13 tablets. In post-Greek Dark Ages times, traces of Eurus&#x27;s worship as part of the Four Winds is found in Titane in Corinthia where a sanctuary to the Winds stood, Sparta where Eurus was described as the &#x27;saviour of Sparta,&#x27; Coronea where they had an altar, and Attica.

== Vulturnus ==
For the Romans, Notus was identified with the god Vulturnus (&quot;he from Vultur&quot;, a mountain in Apulia, perhaps related to the world &quot;vulture&quot;), closely associated with dry and warm weather. He was also called Africanus (meaning &quot;he from Africa&quot;) occasionally, due to the dry type of east wind the ancients knew.

<text>In Greek mythology, Aesacus or Aisakos (; ) was a son of King Priam of Troy. Aesacus sorrowed for the death of his wife or would-be lover, a daughter of the river Cebren, and was transformed into a seabird.

== Mythology ==
=== Apollodorus&#x27; account ===
The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; makes Aesacus son of Priam&#x27;s first wife Arisbe, daughter of Merops. Apollodorus and Tzetzes also make Aesacus a seer who has learned the interpretation of dreams from his grandfather Merops. For them Aesacus is the interpreter of Hecabe&#x27;s dream when Hecabe gives birth to Paris. In Apollodorus the deceased daughter of Cebren for whom Aesacus mourns is his wife named Asterope.
=== Ovid&#x27;s account ===
In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Aesacus is an illegitimate son of King Priam secretly born to the nymph Alexirhoe, daughter of the river Granicus. Aesacus avoids Ilium, preferring the countryside. One day he catches sight of the nymph Hesperia, daughter of the river Cebren, falls in love, and pursues her. However, as Hesperia flees, a venomous snake strikes her and she dies. Aesacus, unable to bear living any longer, leaps from a tall cliff into the sea but as he plunges he is changed into a bird by Tethys. Aesacus still attempts to dive into the depth yet continues still to live in the form of a diving bird. The exact identity of the bird, referred to as &quot;mergus&quot; (later taken as the genus name for merganser ducks) is now unknown, though it has been interpreted as either referring to a cormorant or to Scopoli’s shearwater.
