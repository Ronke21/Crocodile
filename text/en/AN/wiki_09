<text>The Norfolk Tides are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. They are located in Norfolk, Virginia, and are named in nautical reference to the city&#x27;s location on the Chesapeake Bay. The team plays their home games at Harbor Park, which opened in 1993. The Tides previously played at High Rock Park in 1961 and 1962, Frank D. Lawrence Stadium from 1961 to 1969, and at Met Park from its opening in 1970 until the end of the 1992 season.

Originally known as the Portsmouth-Norfolk Tides, the team began play in 1961 as members of the Class A South Atlantic League. In 1963, they joined the Carolina League and became known as the Tidewater Tides, taking their geographic identifier from the Tidewater region. The Tides were replaced by a Triple-A International League team in 1969. The Triple-A Tides carried on the history of the Class A team that preceded them. The club rebranded as the Norfolk Tides in 1993. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Tides were placed in the Triple-A East, which was renamed the International League in 2022.

The team has won seven league championships in its history. They won the Carolina League championship in 1965 as the Class A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. During their 38-year Triple-A affiliation with the New York Mets from 1969 to 2006, they won the Governors&#x27; Cup, the championship of the International League, on five occasions (1972, 1975, 1982, 1983, and 1985) and won the Triple-A World Series in 1983. As an affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles, they won another International League championship and the Triple-A championship in 2023.

==History==

===Before the Tides===
Both Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia, first hosted professional baseball teams in the late 19th century. Among the clubs to hail from these neighboring cities were the Norfolk Tars, which played on and off from 1906 to 1955 primarily in the Virginia League and Piedmont League; the Portsmouth Truckers, which played at intervals from 1895 to 1935 mostly in the Virginia League; the Portsmouth Cubs of the Piedmont League from 1936 to 1952; and the Portsmouth Merrimacs also of the Piedmont League from 1953 to 1955. The Tars folded in July 1955 due to low attendance and steep financial losses. Fiscal problems also caused the Merrimacs to cease operations after the 1955 campaign.

===South Atlantic League (1961–1962)===
Six years after the loss of the Tars and Merrimacs, the Portsmouth-Norfolk Tides were established as members of the Class A South Atlantic League. They played some home games at Frank D. Lawrence Stadium in Portsmouth and some at High Rock Park in Norfolk. The Tides had a limited affiliation with Major League Baseball&#x27;s Kansas City Athletics. Their inaugural season opener was a 7–4 victory in Portsmouth over the Charlotte Hornets with 3,158 people in attendance on April 17, 1961. In 1962, they became an affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. The Tides dropped out of the Sally League after losing their working agreement with St. Louis and following what Tides general manager Marshall Fox called &quot;unfair treatment&quot; by the league.

===Carolina League (1963–1968)===

The Carolina League, a Class A circuit, accepted the Tides as members for 1963. At this point, the team became known as the Tidewater Tides, taking their geographic identifier from the Tidewater region, and began playing their home games exclusively at Lawrence Stadium in Portsmouth. They were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team in their first Carolina League season.

The Tides became the Class A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox in 1964. Under manager Allen Jones, they qualified for the playoffs that year for the first time in team history and defeated the Kinston Eagles in the semifinals to advance to the championship round where they lost to the Winston-Salem Red Sox. Outfielder Ed Stroud won the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. Jones led the team back to the postseason in 1965. After defeating the Peninsula Grays in the semifinals, the Tides won the Carolina League championship by sweeping the Durham Bulls, 2–0.

Tidewater became an affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies in 1966. They made the postseason in 1967 and 1968, but they were defeated in the finals by Durham in 1967 and eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Raleigh-Durham Mets in 1968.

===International League===

====New York Mets (1969–2006)====

In 1969, the New York Mets moved their Triple-A International League (IL) affiliate, the Jacksonville Suns, from Jacksonville, Florida, to Portsmouth as the Tidewater Tides. The team was operated by Tidewater Professional Sports and owned by the Mets. The Triple-A Tides carried on the history of the Class A team that preceded them.

International League Manager of the Year Clyde McCullough led the team to a league-best 76–59 record in their first Triple-A season, but they were eliminated in the semifinals of the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs to determine the IL championship. The 1969 season was the team&#x27;s last at Lawrence Stadium. They moved into the new Met Park, located in Norfolk, in 1970. After another semifinal exit that year, the Tides reached the finals in 1971 but lost the championship to the Rochester Red Wings in the full five-game series. Hank Bauer, manager of the 1972 club, led the Tides to win their first Governors&#x27; Cup with a 3–2 series defeat of the Louisville Colonels in the finals. Following this win, Tidewater competed in the Kodak World Baseball Classic, a five-team round-robin tournament that included the champions of the American Association (the Evansville Triplets) and Pacific Coast League (the Albuquerque Dukes), the Caribbean All-Stars, and the hosting Hawaii Islanders. The Tides went 3–2 but were eliminated. Bauer was selected as the 1972 IL Manager of the Year. The club returned to the playoffs in 1973 but could not advance past the semifinals.

Tidewater finished atop the league standings in 1974 with an 86–55 record under manager Joe Frazier. After sweeping the Charleston Charlies, 3–0, in the semis, they won the IL championship over the Syracuse Chiefs, 3–1. Afterwards, they met the Evansville Triplets, champions of the American Association, in the Junior World Series, which the Tides lost, 4–1. The Tides swept the 1975 International League year-end awards with outfielder Mike Vail as the IL MVP and Rookie of the Year, Craig Swan as the Most Valuable Pitcher, and Frazier as Manager of the Year.

They next appeared in the postseason in 1977, 1979, and 1981, but they were unable to move on past the semifinals. During this stretch, Juan Berenguer won the 1978 Most Valuable Pitcher Award, and outfielder Mookie Wilson won the 1979 Rookie of the Year Award. Tidewater won back-to-back Governors&#x27; Cups in 1982 and 1983. Jack Aker&#x27;s 1982 club swept the Columbus Clippers, 3–0, in the semifinals and did the same against Rochester in the finals. Under Davey Johnson in 1983, the Tides dispatched Columbus in the semis, and then won a second consecutive IL title over the Richmond Braves. That postseason, the Tides, the American Association champion Denver Bears, and Pacific Coast League champion Portland Beavers contested the Triple-A World Series, a round-robin tournament to crown an overall champion of the classification. Tidewater won the series, 3–1. Walt Terrell was the IL&#x27;s Most Valuable Pitcher for 1973.

In 1985, Bob Schaefer led the team to its sixth and final Governors&#x27; Cup championship with a semifinal victory over the Maine Guides and a finals win over Columbus. Though the Tides would remain members of the International League for the next 35 years, they were unable to win another league crown. They lost in the semifinals in 1986 and suffered defeats in the finals of both 1987 and 1988. John Mitchell was selected as the IL Most Valuable Pitcher for 1986. First baseman Randy Milligan won both the 1987 MVP and Rookie of the Year Awards. Third basemen Tom O&#x27;Malley (1989) and Jeff Manto (1994) later won IL MVP Awards.

The club went through a season of change from 1992 to 1993. First, in December 1992, the Mets sold the franchise to a group led by Tampa businessman Ken Young. The Triple-A affiliation between the teams remained intact. In 1993, the Tides left Met Park and moved into the new US$16-million Harbor Park. As they moved into the new facility, the team also replaced the &quot;Tidewater&quot; in its name with that of Norfolk. Also in 1993, the Tides introduced their mascot, Rip Tide. The franchise was awarded the 1993 John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award, recognizing them as the &quot;complete baseball franchise—based on franchise stability, contributions to league stability, contributions to baseball in the community, and promotion of the baseball industry.&quot;

The 1995 Tides led the league with their 86–56 record but were eliminated in the Governors&#x27; Cup finals by the Ottawa Lynx. They did, however, win all four IL year-end awards: MVP (third baseman/outfielder Butch Huskey, Most Valuable Pitcher and Rookie of the Year (Jason Isringhausen, and Manager of the Year (Toby Harrah). Norfolk made three more playoff appearances as a Mets affiliate, exiting in the semifinal rounds of 1996, 2001, and 2005. Mike Fyhrie won the 1996 Most Valuable Pitcher Award, and first baseman Roberto Petagine was the 1997 IL MVP. The 38-year Triple-A affiliation with New York ended after the 2006 season when the Mets elected to affiliate with the New Orleans Zephyrs for 2007.

====Baltimore Orioles (2007–2020)====

Norfolk became the Triple-A affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles in 2007. The Orioles preferred the quality of the facilities at Harbor Park as well as the more favorable weather and proximity of Norfolk compared to their previous location in Ottawa. Maryland Baseball Holding, the Tides&#x27; ownership group led by Ken Young, also owned two other Orioles-affiliated teams at the time: the Bowie Baysox and Frederick Keys.

From 2007 to 2014, the Tides regularly finished with losing records and only finished at or above .500 in 2009, 2012, and 2013. The 2015 team, led by IL Manager of the Year Ron Johnson qualified for the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs as winners of the Southern Division title but lost in the semifinals to Columbus in five games. The Tides added a second mascot, a green sea creature named Triton, in 2016. Norfolk continued to post losing seasons from 2016 to 2019. In 2019, first baseman Ryan Mountcastle was selected as the IL MVP. The start of the 2020 season was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled altogether.

===Triple-A East / International League===
====Baltimore Orioles (2021–present)====

Following the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. The Tides were organized into the Triple-A East and maintained their affiliation with the Baltimore Orioles. Norfolk ended the season in sixth place in the Southeastern Division with a 48–72 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Norfolk finished the tournament tied for 20th place with a 4–6 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Shortstop Gunnar Henderson won the 2022 International League Top MLB Prospect Award.

On April 8, 2023, the Tides set the franchise record as an Orioles affiliate for the most runs scored in a game in a 21–2 victory over the Gwinnett Stripers. In addition, Norfolk tied the franchise record for runs scored in an inning after 11 crossed the plate in the 6th inning. The Tides won the first-half of the 2023 season, clinching a berth in the championship playoffs at the conclusion of the season. In the best-of-three series, the Tides defeated the Durham Bulls to win the International League championship. They won the Triple-A National Championship Game versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers, champions of the Pacific Coast League, 7–6. Buck Britton won the 2023 IL Manager of the Year Award.

The franchise was purchased by Diamond Baseball Holdings on October 17, 2023. In 2024, third baseman Coby Mayo won the IL Top MLB Prospect Award.

<text>Madison Square Garden, colloquially known as the Garden or by its initials MSG, is a multi-purpose indoor arena in New York City. It is located in Midtown Manhattan between Seventh and Eighth avenues from 31st to 33rd streets above Pennsylvania Station. It is the fourth venue to bear the name &quot;Madison Square Garden&quot;; the first two, opened in 1879 and 1890 respectively, were located on Madison Square, on East 26th Street and Madison Avenue, with the third Madison Square Garden (1925) farther uptown at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street.

The Garden hosts professional ice hockey, professional basketball, boxing, mixed martial arts, concerts, ice shows, circuses, professional wrestling, and other forms of sports and entertainment. It is close to other midtown Manhattan landmarks, including the Empire State Building, Koreatown, and Macy&#x27;s at Herald Square. It is home to the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL), the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association (NBA), and was home to the New York Liberty of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 1997 to 2017.

Originally called Madison Square Garden Center, the Garden opened on February 11, 1968, and is the oldest major sporting facility in the New York metropolitan area. It is the oldest arena in the NBA and the second-oldest in the NHL, after Seattle&#x27;s Climate Pledge Arena. As of 2016, MSG is also the second-busiest music arena in the world in terms of ticket sales. Including its two major renovations in 1991 and 2013, the Garden&#x27;s total construction cost was approximately , and it has been ranked as one of the ten most expensive arena venues ever built. It is part of the Pennsylvania Plaza office and retail complex, named for the railway station. Several other operating entities related to the Garden share its name.

==History==

===Previous Gardens===
Madison Square is formed by the intersection of 5th Avenue and Broadway at 23rd Street in Manhattan. It was named after James Madison, fourth President of the United States.

Two venues called Madison Square Garden were located just northeast of the square, the original Garden from 1879 to 1890, and the second Garden from 1890 to 1925. The first, leased to P. T. Barnum, was demolished in 1890 because of a leaky roof and dangerous balconies that had collapsed, resulting in deaths. The second was designed by noted architect Stanford White. The new building was built by a syndicate that included J. P. Morgan, Andrew Carnegie, P. T. Barnum, Darius Mills, James Stillman and W. W. Astor. White gave them a Beaux-Arts structure with a Moorish feel, including a minaret-like tower modeled after Giralda, the bell tower of the Cathedral of Seville, soaring 32 stories, the city&#x27;s second-tallest building at the time and dominating Madison Square Park. It was by , and the main hall, which was the largest in the world, measured by with permanent seating for 8,000 people and floor space for thousands more. It had a 1,200-seat theater, a concert hall with a capacity of 1,500, the largest restaurant in the city, and a roof garden cabaret. The building cost $3 million. Madison Square Garden II was unsuccessful like the first Garden, and the New York Life Insurance Company, which held the mortgage on it, decided to tear it down in 1925 to make way for a new headquarters building, which would become the landmark Cass Gilbert-designed New York Life Building.

A third Madison Square Garden opened in a new location, on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, from 1925 to 1968. Groundbreaking on the third Madison Square Garden took place on January 9, 1925. Designed by the noted theater architect Thomas W. Lamb, it was built at the cost of $4.75 million in 249 days by boxing promoter Tex Rickard; the arena was dubbed &quot;The House That Tex Built&quot;. The arena was by , with seating on three levels, and a maximum capacity of 18,496 spectators for boxing.

Demolition commenced in 1968 after the opening of the current Garden, and was completed in early 1969. The site is now the location of One Worldwide Plaza.

===Current Garden===
In February 1959, former automobile manufacturer Graham-Paige purchased a 40% interest in the Madison Square Garden for $4 million and later gained control. In November 1960, Graham-Paige president Irving Mitchell Felt purchased from the Pennsylvania Railroad the rights to build at Penn Station. To build the new facility, the above-ground portions of the original Pennsylvania Station were torn down.
The new structure was one of the first of its kind to be built above the platforms of an active railroad station. It was an engineering feat constructed by Robert E. McKee of El Paso, Texas. Public outcry over the demolition of the Pennsylvania Station structure—an outstanding example of Beaux-Arts architecture—led to the creation of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The venue opened on February 11, 1968. Comparing the new and the old Penn Station, Yale architectural historian Vincent Scully wrote, &quot;One entered the city like a god; one scuttles in now like a rat.&quot;

In 1972, Felt proposed moving the Knicks and Rangers to a then incomplete venue in the New Jersey Meadowlands, the Meadowlands Sports Complex. The Garden was also the home arena for the NY Raiders/NY Golden Blades of the World Hockey Association. The Meadowlands would eventually host its own NBA and NHL teams, the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils, respectively. The New York Giants and Jets of the National Football League (NFL) also relocated there. In 1977, the arena was sold to Gulf and Western Industries. Felt&#x27;s efforts fueled controversy between the Garden and New York City over real estate taxes. The disagreement again flared in 1980 when the Garden again challenged its tax bill. The arena has enjoyed tax-free status since the 1980s, under the condition that all Knicks and Rangers home games must be hosted at MSG, lest it lose this exemption. As such, when the Rangers have played neutral-site games—even those in New York City, such as the 2018 NHL Winter Classic, they have always been designated as the visiting team. The tax agreement includes an act of God clause, which allowed Knicks and Rangers home games to be played elsewhere during the 2020 NBA Bubble and 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, respectively, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 1984, the four streets immediately surrounding the Garden were designated as Joe Louis Plaza, in honor of boxer Joe Louis, who had made eight successful title defenses in the previous Madison Square Garden.

=== 1991 renovation ===
In April 1986, Gulf and Western announced that they would build a new Madison Square Garden a few blocks away on the site of present-day Hudson Yards. The plan would cost an estimated $150 million and included the demolition of the 1964 building to replace it with a new office tower development. After years of planning, Gulf and Western decided against building a new arena in favor of a renovation after estimated costs doubled during the process.
Garden owners spent $200 million in 1991 to renovate facilities and add 89 suites in place of hundreds of upper-tier seats. The project was designed by Ellerbe Becket. The renovation was criticized for perceived corporatization. Additionally, the renovation made bathrooms larger, expanded menus, added a new ventilation system, replaced all of the seats with new cushioned teal and violet seats, and refurbished both home teams&#x27; locker rooms.

In 2000, current MSG owner James Dolan was quoted as saying that a new arena was being considered as the current building was starting to show its age.

In 2004–2005, Cablevision battled with the City of New York over the proposed West Side arena, which was canceled. Cablevision then announced plans to raze the Garden, replace it with high-rise commercial buildings, and build a new Garden one block away at the site of the James Farley Post Office. Meanwhile, a new project to renovate and modernize the Garden completed phase one in time for the Rangers and Knicks&#x27; 2011–12 seasons, though the vice president of the Garden says he remains committed to the installation of an extension of Penn Station at the Farley Post Office site. While the Knicks and Rangers were not displaced, the New York Liberty played at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, during the renovation.

Madison Square Garden is the last of the NBA and NHL arenas not to be named after a corporate sponsor.

===2011–2013 renovation===
Madison Square Garden&#x27;s $1 billion second renovation took place mainly over three off-seasons. It was set to begin after the 2009–10 hockey/basketball seasons, but was delayed until after the 2010–11 seasons. Renovation was done in phases, with the majority of the work done in the summer months to minimize disruptions to the NHL and NBA seasons. While the Rangers and Knicks were not displaced, the Liberty played their home games through the 2013 season at Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, during the renovation.

New features include a larger entrance with interactive kiosks, retail, climate-controlled space, and broadcast studio; larger concourses; new lighting and LED video systems with HDTV; new seating; two new pedestrian walkways suspended from the ceiling to allow fans to look directly down onto the games being played below; more dining options; and improved dressing rooms, locker rooms, green rooms, upgraded roof, and production offices. The lower bowl concourse, called the Madison Concourse, remains on the sixth floor. The upper bowl concourse was relocated to the eighth floor and it is known as the Garden Concourse. The seventh floor houses the new Madison Suites and the Madison Club. The upper bowl was built on top of these suites. The rebuilt concourses are wider than their predecessors, and include large windows that offer views of the city streets around the Garden.

Construction of the lower bowl (Phase 1) was completed in 2011. An extended off-season for the Garden permitted some advance work to begin on the new upper bowl, which was completed in 2012. This advance work included the West Balcony on the tenth floor, taking the place of sky-boxes, and new end-ice 300 level seating. The construction of the upper bowl along with the Madison Suites and the Madison Club (Phase 2) were completed for the 2012–13 NHL and NBA seasons. Phase 3, which involved the construction of the new lobby known as Chase Square, the Chase Bridges on the 10th floor, and the new scoreboard, was completed for the 2013–14 NHL and NBA seasons.

===Penn Station renovation controversy===
Madison Square Garden is seen as an obstacle in the renovation and future expansion of Penn Station, which expanded in 2021 with the opening of Moynihan Train Hall at the James Farley Post Office, and some have proposed moving MSG to other sites in western Manhattan. On February 15, 2013, Manhattan Community Board 5 voted 36–0 against granting a renewal to MSG&#x27;s operating permit in perpetuity and proposed a 10-year limit instead in order to build a new Penn Station where the arena is currently standing. Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer said, &quot;Moving the arena is an important first step to improving Penn Station.&quot; The Madison Square Garden Company responded by saying that &quot;[i]t is incongruous to think that M.S.G. would be considering moving.&quot;

In May 2013, four architecture firms – SHoP Architects, SOM, H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture, and Diller Scofidio + Renfro – submitted proposals for a new Penn Station. SHoP Architects recommended moving Madison Square Garden to the Morgan Postal Facility a few blocks southwest, as well as removing 2 Penn Plaza and redeveloping other towers, and an extension of the High Line to Penn Station. Meanwhile, SOM proposed moving Madison Square Garden to the area just south of the James Farley Post Office, and redeveloping the area above Penn Station as a mixed-use development with commercial, residential, and recreational space. H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture wanted to move the arena to a new pier west of Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, four blocks west of the current station and arena. Then, according to H3&#x27;s plan, four skyscrapers would be built, one at each of the four corners of the new Penn Station superblock, with a roof garden on top of the station; the Farley Post Office would become an education center. Finally, Diller Scofidio + Renfro proposed a mixed-use development on the site, with spas, theaters, a cascading park, a pool, and restaurants; Madison Square Garden would be moved two blocks west, next to the post office. DS+F also proposed high-tech features in the station, such as train arrival and departure boards on the floor, and apps that would inform waiting passengers of ways to occupy their time until they board their trains. Madison Square Garden rejected the notion that it would be relocated, and called the plans &quot;pie-in-the-sky&quot;.
In June 2013, the New York City Council Committee on Land Use voted unanimously to give the Garden a ten-year permit, at the end of which period the owners would either have to relocate or go back through the permission process. On July 24, the City Council voted to give the Garden a 10-year operating permit by a vote of 47–1. &quot;This is the first step in finding a new home for Madison Square Garden and building a new Penn Station that is as great as New York and suitable for the 21st century,&quot; said City Council speaker Christine Quinn. &quot;This is an opportunity to reimagine and redevelop Penn Station as a world-class transportation destination.&quot;

In October 2014, the Morgan facility was selected as the ideal area for Madison Square Garden to be moved, following the 2014 MAS Summit in New York City. More plans for the station were discussed. Then, in January 2016, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a redevelopment plan for Penn Station that would involve the removal of The Theater at Madison Square Garden, but would otherwise leave the arena intact.

In June 2023, nearing the end of the Garden&#x27;s ten-year permit granted by the city, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, along with Amtrak and NJ Transit, filed a report stating that MSG is no longer compatible with Penn Station, with the report saying, &quot;MSG&#x27;s existing configuration and property boundaries impose severe constraints on the station that impede the safe and efficient movement of passengers and restrict efforts to implement improvements, particularly at the street and platform levels.&quot; On September 14, 2023, the New York City Council voted 48–0 to renew the operating permit for Madison Square Garden for five years, the shortest ever granted by the city to the Garden.

==Events==

===Regular events===

====Sports====
Madison Square Garden hosts approximately 320 events a year. It is the home to the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League, and the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association. Before 2020, the New York Rangers, New York Knicks, and the Madison Square Garden arena itself were all owned by the Madison Square Garden Company. The MSG Company split into two entities in 2020, with the Garden arena and other non-sports assets spun off into Madison Square Garden Entertainment and the Rangers and Knicks remaining with the original company, renamed Madison Square Garden Sports. Both entities remain under the voting control of James Dolan and his family. The arena is also host to the Big East men&#x27;s basketball tournament and was home to the finals of the National Invitation Tournament from the beginning of its existence up until 2022. It also hosts select home games for the St. John&#x27;s Red Storm, representing St. John&#x27;s University in men&#x27;s college basketball, and almost any other kind of indoor activity that draws large audiences, such as the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and the 2004 Republican National Convention.

The Garden was home of the NBA draft and NIT Season Tip-Off, as well as the former New York City home of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus and Disney on Ice; all four events are now held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. It served the New York Cosmos for half of their home games during the 1983–84 NASL Indoor season.

Many of boxing&#x27;s biggest fights were held at Madison Square Garden, including the Roberto Durán–Ken Buchanan affair, the first Muhammad Ali – Joe Frazier bout and the US debut of Anthony Joshua that ended in a huge upset when he was beaten by Andy Ruiz. Before promoters such as Don King and Bob Arum moved boxing to Las Vegas, Nevada, Madison Square Garden was a popular location for boxing. The original ring, which was brought from the second and third generation of the Garden, was officially retired on September 19, 2007, and donated to the International Boxing Hall of Fame after 82 years of service. A ring replaced it beginning on October 6 of that same year. The UFC has hosted many events at Madison Square Garden in recent years and has put on some of the highest grossing PPV events in history.

====Pro wrestling====
Madison Square Garden has hosted many notable WWE (formerly WWF and WWWF) events, and it&#x27;s affectionally known as WWE&#x27;s &quot;home office&quot;. The Garden has hosted three WrestleMania events, including the first edition of the annual marquee event for WWE, as well as the 10th and 20th editions. Madison Square Garden is also one of two venues (the other being Allstate Arena) to host WrestleMania three times.

It also hosted the Royal Rumble in 2000 and 2008; SummerSlam in 1988, 1991 and 1998; as well as Survivor Series in 1996, 2002 and 2011. Multiple episodes of WWE&#x27;s weekly shows, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; have been broadcast from the Arena as well.

New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Ring of Honor (ROH) hosted their G1 Supercard supershow at the venue on April 6, 2019. A year later it was announced that New Japan Pro-Wrestling would return to Madison Square Garden alone on August 22, 2020, for NJPW Wrestle Dynasty. In May 2020, NJPW announced that the Wrestle Dynasty show would be postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

====Concerts====
Madison Square Garden hosts more high-profile concert events than any other venue in New York City. It has been the venue for Michael Jackson&#x27;s Bad World Tour in 1988, George Harrison&#x27;s The Concert for Bangladesh, The Concert for New York City following the September 11 attacks, John Lennon&#x27;s final concert appearance during an Elton John concert on Thanksgiving Night in 1974 before his murder in 1980, and Elvis Presley, who gave four sold-out performances in 1972, his first and last ever in New York City. Parliament-Funkadelic headlined numerous sold-out shows in 1977 and 1978. Kiss, who were formed in the arena&#x27;s city and three of whose members were city-born, did six shows during their second half of the 1970s main attraction peak or &quot;heyday&quot;: four sold out winter shows at the arena in 1977 (February 18 and December 14–16), and another two shows only this time in summer for a decade-ender in 1979 (July 24–25). They played their final two shows at the venue on the December 1 and 2, 2023, the 50th anniversary year of their formation. Billy Joel, another city-born and fellow 1970&#x27;s pop star, played his first Garden show on December 14, 1978, with that month&#x27;s follow ups on the 15th, 16th and 18th. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s three-night stand in July 1973 was recorded and released as both a film and album titled &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot;. The Police played their final show of their reunion tour at the Garden in 2008.

In the summer of 2017, Phish held a 13 night series of concerts called &quot;The Bakers&#x27; Dozen&quot;. During which the band played 237 unique songs, repeating none during the entire run. The Garden commemorated &quot;The Bakers&#x27; Dozen&quot; by adding a Phish themed banner to the rafters. With their first MSG show taking place on December 30, 1994, Phish has regularly played annual multi night runs, typically around New Year&#x27;s Eve. As of January 2025, Phish has performed 87 times at MSG.
Elton John once held the all-time record for the greatest number of appearances at the Garden with 64 shows. In a 2009 press release, John was quoted as saying &quot;Madison Square Garden is my favorite venue in the whole world. I chose to have my 60th birthday concert there, because of all the incredible memories I&#x27;ve had playing the venue.&quot; A DVD recording was released as &quot;Elton 60—Live at Madison Square Garden&quot;.

The current record-holder for most appearances is Billy Joel, who as of July 2024 had played the Garden 150 times. That figure includes a &quot;residency&quot; of monthly concerts that he started in 2014 and played nearly continuously for a decade. Joel has stated that the site &quot;has the best acoustics, the best audiences, the best reputation, and the best history of great artists who have played there. It is the iconic, holy temple of rock and roll for most touring acts.&quot;
The Grateful Dead performed in the venue 53 times from 1979 to 1994, with the first show being held on January 7, 1979, and the last being on October 19, 1994. Their longest run being done in September 1991.

The Who have headlined at the venue 32 times, including a four-night stand in 1974, a five-night stand in 1979, a six-night stand in 1996, and four-night stands in 2000 and 2002. They also performed at The Concert for New York City in 2001.

On March 10, 2020, a 50th-anniversary celebration of The Allman Brothers Band titled &#x27;The Brothers&#x27; took place, featuring the five surviving members of the final Allman Brothers lineup and Chuck Leavell. Dickey Betts was invited to participate but his health precluded him from traveling. This was the final concert at the venue before the COVID-19 pandemic forced its closure. Live shows returned to The Garden when the Foo Fighters headlined a show there on June 20, 2021. The show was for a vaccinated audience only and was the first 100 percent capacity concert in a New York arena since the start of the pandemic.

====Other events====

It hosted the 1976 Democratic National Convention and 1980 Democratic National Convention with Carter, the 1992 Democratic National Convention with Clinton, and the 2004 Republican National Convention with Bush, and hosted the NFL draft for many years (later held at Garden-leased Radio City Music Hall, now shared between cities of NFL franchises). The &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; Teen Tournament and several installments of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; were filmed at MSG in 1999, as well as several episodes of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in 1999 and 2013.

The New York City Police Academy, Baruch College/CUNY, and Yeshiva University also hold their annual graduation ceremonies at Madison Square Garden. It hosted the Grammy Awards in 1972, 1997, 2003, and 2018 (which are normally held in Los Angeles) as well as the Latin Grammy Awards of 2006.

The group and Best in Show competitions of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show have been held at MSG every February since 1877. Its original run at MSG through 2020 was the arena&#x27;s longest continuous tenancy. In 2021, the event moved to Tarrytown, and later the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show returned to MSG in 2025 for the first time since 2020.

===Notable firsts and significant events===

Madison Square Garden was the location of a 1939 Nazi rally sponsored by the German American Bund. According to the World War Two Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, the rally falsely presented itself as a &quot;Pro-American Rally&quot;. According to NPR, the rally had more than 20,000 people in attendance. The rally featured a 30-foot banner of former American president George Washington, featured next to two American flag banners and two banners featuring the Nazi Swastika.

The Garden hosted the Stanley Cup Finals and NBA Finals simultaneously on two occasions: in 1972 and 1994. MSG has hosted the following All-Star Games:
* NHL All-Star Game: 1973, 1994
* NBA All-Star Game: 1998, 2015
* WNBA All-Star Game: 1999, 2003, 2006

==Recognition given by Madison Square Garden==

===Madison Square Garden Gold Ticket Award===

In 1977, Madison Square Garden announced Gold Ticket Awards would be given to performers who had brought in more than 100,000 unit ticket sales to the venue. Since the arena&#x27;s seating capacity is about 20,000, this would require a minimum of five sold-out shows. Performers who were eligible for the award at the time of its inauguration included Chicago, John Denver, Peter Frampton, the Rolling Stones, the Jackson 5, Elton John, Led Zeppelin, Sly Stone, Jethro Tull, The Who, and Yes. Graeme Edge, who received his award in 1981 as a member of The Moody Blues, said he found his gold ticket to be an interesting piece of memorabilia because he could use it to attend any event at the Garden. Many other performers received Gold Ticket Awards between 1977 and 1994.

===Madison Square Garden Platinum Ticket Award===
Madison Square Garden also gave Platinum Ticket Awards to performers who sold over 250,000 tickets to their shows throughout the years. Winners of the Platinum Ticket Awards include: the Rolling Stones (1981), Elton John (1982), Yes (1984), Billy Joel (1984), the Grateful Dead (1987), and Madonna (2004).

Elton John was the first entertainer to be inducted into the MSG Walk of Fame in 1992. 
Billy Joel was inducted at a date after Elton John, 
and the Rolling Stones were inducted in 1998. In 2015, the Grateful Dead were inducted into the MSG Walk of Fame along with at least three sports-related figures.

It also hosted the NBA draft from 2001 to 2010. The theater also occasionally hosts boxing matches.

<doc id="75143" wikidata="Q158825" url="?curid=75143" title="Jeremiah">
<text>Jeremiah (, ; – ), also called Jeremias or the &quot;weeping prophet&quot;, was one of the major prophets of the Hebrew Bible. According to Jewish tradition, Jeremiah authored the book that bears his name, the Books of Kings, and the Book of Lamentations, with the assistance and under the editorship of Baruch ben Neriah, his scribe and disciple.

According to the narrative of the Book of Jeremiah, the prophet emerged as a significant figure in the Kingdom of Judah in the late 7th and early 6th centuries BC. Born into a priestly lineage, Jeremiah reluctantly accepted his call to prophethood, embarking on a tumultuous ministry more than five decades long. His life was marked by opposition, imprisonment, and personal struggles, according to Jeremiah 32 and 37. Central to Jeremiah&#x27;s message were prophecies of impending divine judgment, forewarning of the nation&#x27;s idolatry, social injustices, and moral decay. According to the Bible, he prophesied the siege of Jerusalem and Babylonian captivity as consequences for disobedience. Jeremiah&#x27;s teachings encompassed lamentations, oracles, and symbolic acts, emphasising the urgency of repentance and the restoration of a covenant relationship with God.

Jeremiah is an essential figure in both Judaism and Christianity. His words are read in synagogues as part of the haftara and he is quoted in the New Testament. Islam also regards Jeremiah as a prophet and his narrative is recounted in Islamic tradition.

== Biblical narratives ==
=== Lineage and early life ===

Jeremiah was known as a prophet from the thirteenth year of Josiah, king of Judah (626 BC), until after the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple in 587 BC. This period spanned the reigns of five kings of Judah: Josiah, Jehoahaz, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah. The prophetess Huldah was a relative and contemporary of Jeremiah, while the prophet Zephaniah was his mentor.

Jeremiah was the son of Hilkiah, a priest from the land of Benjamin in the village of Anathoth. The difficulties he encountered, as described in the books of Jeremiah and Lamentations, have prompted scholars to refer to him as &quot;the weeping prophet&quot;.

Jeremiah was called to prophecy  BC by God to proclaim Jerusalem&#x27;s coming destruction by invaders from the north. This was because Israel had forsaken God by worshiping the idols of Baal and burning their children as offerings to Baal. The nation had deviated so far from God&#x27;s laws that they had broken the covenant, causing God to withdraw his blessings. Jeremiah was guided by God to proclaim that the nation of Judah would suffer famine, foreign conquest, plunder, and captivity in a land of strangers.
According to , Yahweh called Jeremiah to prophesy in about 626 BC, about five years before Josiah&#x27;s famous reforms. However, they were insufficient to save Judah and Jerusalem from destruction, because of the sins of Manasseh, Josiah&#x27;s grandfather, and Judah&#x27;s return to the idolatry of foreign gods after Josiah&#x27;s death. Jeremiah was said to have been appointed to reveal the sins of the people and the punishment to come.

Jeremiah resisted the call by complaining that he was only a child and did not know how to speak, but the Lord placed the word in Jeremiah&#x27;s mouth, commanding &quot;Get yourself ready!&quot; The qualities of a prophet listed in Jeremiah 1 include not being afraid, standing up to speak, speaking as told, and going where sent. Since Jeremiah is described as emerging well trained and fully literate from his earliest preaching, his relationship with the Shaphan family has been used to suggest that he may have trained at the scribal school in Jerusalem over which Shaphan presided.

In his early years of being a prophet, Jeremiah was primarily a preaching prophet, preaching throughout Israel. He condemned idolatry, the greed of priests, and false prophets. Many years later, God instructed Jeremiah to write down these early oracles and his other messages. Charles Cutler Torrey argues that the prophet accuses priests and scribes of altering the actual Scriptures with &quot;scribal additions&quot; to accommodate the worship of other deities.

=== Persecution ===
Jeremiah&#x27;s prophecies prompted plots against him. Unhappy with Jeremiah&#x27;s message, possibly from concern that it would shut down the Anathoth sanctuary, his priestly kin and the men of Anathoth plotted to kill him. However, the Lord revealed the conspiracy to Jeremiah, protected his life, and declared disaster for the people of Anathoth. When Jeremiah complains to the Lord about this persecution, he is told that the attacks on him will become worse.

A priest, Pashur the son of Immer, a temple official in Jerusalem, had Jeremiah beaten and put in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin for a day. After this, Jeremiah laments the travails and mockery that speaking God&#x27;s word have caused him. He recounts how, if he tries to shut God&#x27;s word inside, it burns in his heart and he is unable to hold it in.

=== Conflict with false prophets ===
While Jeremiah was prophesying the coming destruction, he denounced a number of other prophets who were prophesying peace.

According to the book of Jeremiah, during the reign of King Zedekiah, the Lord instructed Jeremiah to make a yoke with the message that the nation would be subject to the king of Babylon. The false prophet Hananiah took the yoke off Jeremiah&#x27;s neck and broke it, prophesying that within two years the Lord would break the yoke of the king of Babylon, but Jeremiah prophesied in return: &quot;You have broken the yoke of wood, but you have made instead a yoke of iron.&quot;

=== Relationship with the Northern Kingdom (Samaria) ===
Jeremiah was sympathetic to, as well as descended from, the northern Kingdom of Israel. Many of his first reported oracles are about, and addressed to, the Israelites at Samaria. He resembles the northern prophet Hosea in his use of language and examples of God&#x27;s relationship to Israel. Hosea seems to have been the first prophet to describe the desired relationship as an example of ancient Israelite marriage, where a man might be polygamous, while a woman was only permitted one husband. Jeremiah often repeats Hosea&#x27;s marital imagery.

=== Babylon ===
The biblical narrative portrays Jeremiah as being subject to additional persecutions. After Jeremiah prophesied that Jerusalem would be handed over to the Babylonian army, the king&#x27;s officials, including Pashur the priest, tried to convince King Zedekiah that Jeremiah should be put to death for disheartening the soldiers and the people. Zedekiah allowed them, and they cast Jeremiah into a cistern, where he sank down into the mud. The intent seemed to be to kill Jeremiah by starvation, while allowing the officials to claim to be innocent of his blood. Ebed-Melech, an Ethiopian, rescued Jeremiah by pulling him out of the cistern, but Jeremiah remained imprisoned until Jerusalem fell to the Babylonian army in 587 BC.

The Babylonians released Jeremiah, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence, according to a Babylonian edict. Jeremiah accordingly went to Mizpah in Benjamin with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea.

=== Egypt ===
Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, who had been assassinated by an Israelite prince in the pay of Ammon &quot;for working with the Babylonians.&quot; Refusing to listen to Jeremiah&#x27;s counsel, Johanan fled to Egypt, taking with him Jeremiah and Baruch, Jeremiah&#x27;s faithful scribe and servant, and the king&#x27;s daughters. There, the prophet probably spent the remainder of his life, still seeking to turn the people back to God. There is no authentic record of his death.

== Historicity ==
The consensus is that there was a historical prophet named Jeremiah and that portions of the book probably were written by Jeremiah and/or his scribe Baruch. Views range from the belief that the narratives and poetic sections in Jeremiah are contemporary with his life (W. L. Holladay), to the view that the work of the original prophet is beyond identification or recovery (R. P. Carroll).

According to Rainer Albertz, first there were early collections of oracles, including material in ch. 2–6, 8–10, 13, 21–23, etc. Then there was an early Deuteronomistic redaction which Albertz dates to around 550 BC, with the original ending to the book at 25:13. There was a second redaction around 545–540 BC which added much more material, up to about ch. 45. Then there was a third redaction around 525–520 BC, expanding the book up to the ending at 51:64. Then there were further post-exilic redactions adding ch. 52 and editing content throughout the book.

Although Jeremiah was often thought of traditionally as the author of the Book of Lamentations, this is probably a collection of individual and communal laments by others composed at various times throughout the Babylonian captivity.

=== Archaeology ===
==== Nebo-Sarsekim tablet ====
In July 2007, Assyrologist Michael Jursa translated a cuneiform tablet dated to 595 BC, as describing a Nabusharrussu-ukin as &quot;the chief eunuch&quot; of Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. Jursa hypothesized that this reference might be to the same individual as the Nebo-Sarsekim mentioned in .

==== Seals ====
A 7th-century BC seal of Jehucal, son of Shelemiah and another of Gedaliah, son of Pashhur (mentioned together in Jeremiah 38:1; Jehucal also mentioned in Jeremiah 37:3) were found during excavation by Eilat Mazar in the city of David, Jerusalem, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

==== Tel Arad ostraca ====
Pottery shards at Tel Arad were unearthed in the 1970s that mention Pashhur, and this reference may be to the same individual mentioned in Jeremiah 20:1.

== Religious views ==
He was first added to Bede&#x27;s Martyrology.

=== Judaism ===

In Jewish rabbinic literature, especially the aggadah, Jeremiah and Moses are always mentioned together, An ancient midrash, in connection with presented their life and works in parallel, in which &quot;a prophet like Moses&quot; is promised, states Jeremiah&#x27;s time as prophet was similar with Moses, which is 40 years. Moses also prophesied that his own tribe, Tribe of Levi, will rebel against Judah, while Jeremiah&#x27;s tribe would in turn rebel against Jeremiah himself. In the year of the prophesied event, Moses also said that he himself will be exiled into watery areas, while Jeremiah will be jailed in a pit. Then Moses will be saved by a slave of Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, while subsequently Jeremiah will be rescued by a slave named Ebed-melech; After such, the Deuteronomy closed the chapter with Moses reprimanded the people in discourses; so did Jeremiah. The prophet Ezekiel was a son of Jeremiah according to rabbinic literature. In 2 Maccabees 2:4ff, Jeremiah is credited with hiding the Ark, incense altar, and tabernacle on the mountain of Moses.

=== Christianity ===
Christian worship services regularly include readings from the Book of Jeremiah. The author of the Gospel of Matthew is especially mindful of how the events in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus fulfill Jeremianic prophecies. There are about forty direct quotations of the book in the New Testament, most appearing in Revelation 18 in connection with the destruction of Babylon. The Epistle to the Hebrews also picks up the fulfilment of the prophetic expectation of the new covenant.

In Christianity, there are several feast days which commemorate Jeremiah:
* 16 January – commemoration of overthrowing the Idols by prophet Jeremiah (OO)
* 7 April – Saint Michael delivers Jeremiah from prison (OO)
* 30 April – Martyrdom of Jeremiah the Prophet (OO)
* 1 May – commemoration in Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church
* 26 June – commemoration in LCMS (R)

=== Islam ===
Jeremiah is regarded as a prophet in Islam. In Arabic, Jeremiah&#x27;s name is usually vocalised &quot;Irmiyā&quot;, &quot;Armiyā&quot; or &quot;Ūrmiyā&quot;. However, since the name of Jeremiah is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran and Hadith, belief in Jeremiah was considered not part of the Five Pillars of Islam by the academic community of Islam, regarding Jeremiah instead historical supplementary material, since his name was only found in the tafsir and other non-canonical Islamic literature. Nevertheless, since his status as prophet was generally undisputed in Islam, Muslims apply &quot;PBUH&quot; or &quot;Peace Belong Upon Him&quot; as an honorific for Jeremiah.

The narratives of Jeremiah in Islamic belief closely correspond with the account given in the Hebrew Bible, and are found in the Ibn Kathir work of al-Bidaya wa l-Nihaya &amp; &quot;Qisas Al-Anbiya&quot; (History of prophets), Al-Tabari work of &quot;History of the Prophets and Kings&quot;, and Ibn Asakir work of &quot;History of Damascus&quot;.

Islamic literature narrated a detailed account of the Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC), which parallels the account given in the Book of Jeremiah.

==== Interpretation of Quran and Hadith ====
The oldest Islamic narration about Jeremiah was found in the tradition from Ibn Abbas, which identified Jeremiah as Khidr. However, This Hadith tradition was considered inauthentic and not generally accepted by Ibn Kathir in his work, al-Bidaya wa l-Nihaya.

According to al-Qurtubi, the interpretation of the 11th verse Quran chapter Al-Anbiya has mentioned the unnamed figure in the verse as Jeremiah, which musing in the similar narrative with the biblical version of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s invasion of Jerusalem. However, al-Qurtubi also further added in his interpretation that during the meeting of Jeremiah with Nebuchadnezzar, Jeremiah revealed to him about the prophesied advent of Muhammad in the land of Hejaz.

Ibn Kathir tafsir narrate that the Parable of the Hamlet in Ruins, which from the 259th verse of Al-Baqara chapter focused about Jeremiah, when he was commanded by God to reconstruct the devastated Jerusalem after Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s invasion.

In Quran Sura (chapter) 17 (Al-Isra), Ayah (verse) 4–7, that is about the two corruptions of children of Israel on the earth, some hadith and tafsir cite that one of these corruptions is the imprisonment and persecution of Jeremiah. Separately, Ibn Kathir interpretation of the 11th verse of al-Isra also discussed about Jeremiah.

==== Other traditions ====
Ibn Asakir has mentioned in his work titled &quot;Tarikh Dimashq&quot; (History of Damascus), that Jeremiah was a son of Hilkiah, who hailed from the tribe of Levy which descended from Jacob. According to one tradition which recorded by Ibn Kathir, Wahb has narrated that the timeline of Jeremiah as prophet was between the era of David and the era of Zechariah.

Wahb ibn Munabbih, who gave Israʼiliyyat account about Jeremiah which turned &quot;upon the main points of the Old Testament story of Jeremiah: his call to be a prophet, his mission to the king of Judah, his mission to the people and his reluctance, the announcement of a foreign tyrant who is to rule over Judah.&quot;

According to some Jewish narratives and Ibn Kathir, Zoroaster was once a disciple of Jeremiah. However, the two of them came into conflict which ended with Jeremiah disowning Zoroaster. Jeremiah then cast a curse upon Zoroaster, causing him to suffer leprosy. Zoroaster later moved to a place in modern-day Azerbaijan, ruled by Bashtaasib, governor of Nebuchadnezzar, and spread his teaching of Zoroastrianism there. Bashtaasib then followed his teaching, forced the inhabitants of Persia to convert to Zoroastrianism and killed those who refused. Ibn Kathir quoted the original narrative which was borrowed from Tabari&#x27;s record of the &quot;History of Jerusalem&quot;. He also mentioned that Zoroastrian was synonymous with Majus.

==== Religious ritual ====
Jeremiah is listed amongst the prophets in the work of salawat Dalail al-Khayrat, an Islamic prayer collection made by Muhammad al-Jazuli from Shadhili order of Sufi.

== Cultural influence ==
Jeremiah inspired the French noun &quot;jérémiade&quot;, and subsequently the English &quot;jeremiad&quot;, meaning &quot;a lamentation; mournful complaint,&quot; or further, &quot;a cautionary or angry harangue.&quot;

Jeremiah has periodically been a popular first name in the United States, beginning with the early Puritan settlers, who often took the names of biblical prophets and apostles. Jeremiah was substituted for the Irish &quot;Diarmuid/Diarmaid&quot; (also anglicised as Dermot), with which it has no etymological connection, when Gaelic names were frowned upon in official records. The name Jeremy also derives from Jeremiah.

Sohrab Sepehri, an Iranian poet and painter, has mentioned Jeremiah in his work as &quot;The weeping prophet&quot;.

<text>Gaius Messius Quintus Trajanus Decius ( 201June 251), known as Trajan Decius or simply Decius (), was Roman emperor from 249 to 251.

A distinguished politician during the reign of Philip the Arab, Decius was proclaimed emperor by his troops after putting down a rebellion in Moesia. In 249, he defeated and killed Philip near Verona and was recognized as emperor by the Senate afterwards. During his reign, he attempted to strengthen the Roman state and its religion, leading to the Decian persecution, where a number of prominent Christians (including Pope Fabian) were put to death. In the last year of his reign, Decius co-ruled with his son Herennius Etruscus, until they were both killed by the Goths in the Battle of Abritus.

== Early life and rise to power ==

Trajanus Decius was born Gaius Messius Quintus Decius Valerinus at Budalia, Illyricum, near Sirmium in Pannonia Inferior. Decius was one of the first among a long succession of Roman emperors (Illyrian emperors) to originate from the Danube provinces, often referred to as Illyricum. Unlike some of his immediate imperial predecessors such as Philip the Arab or Maximinus Thrax who did not have extensive administrative experience before assuming the throne, Decius was a distinguished senator who had served as suffect consul in 232, had been governor of Moesia and Germania Inferior soon afterwards, served as governor of Hispania Tarraconensis between 235 and 238, and was urban prefect of Rome during the early reign of Emperor Philip the Arab.

Around 245, Philip entrusted Decius with an important command on the Danube. By the end of 248 or 249, Decius was sent to quell the revolt of Pacatian and his troops in Moesia and Pannonia; some modern historians see this rebellion as a reflection of emerging Balkan separatism. After the collapse of the revolt, Decius let the troops proclaim him emperor. Philip advanced against him and was killed at Verona, Italy, in September 249. The Senate then recognized Decius as emperor, giving him the attribute &quot;Traianus&quot; in reference to Emperor Trajan. According to the Byzantine historian Zosimus, Decius was clothed in purple and forced to undertake the [burdens of] government, despite his reluctance and unwillingness.

==Political and monumental initiatives==
Decius&#x27; political program was focused on the restoration of the strength of the State, both militarily opposing the external threats, and restoring the public piety with a program of renovation of the state religion.

===Reviving the censorship===
Either as a concession to the Senate, or perhaps with the idea of improving public morality, Decius endeavoured to revive the separate office and authority of the censor. The choice was left to the Senate, who unanimously selected Valerian (the future emperor). But Valerian, well aware of the dangers and difficulties attached to the office at such a time, declined the responsibility. The invasion of the Goths and Decius&#x27; death put an end to the abortive attempt.

===Baths of Decius===

During his reign, he proceeded with several building projects in Rome, including the Thermae Decianae (Baths of Decius in the Aventine), which were completed in 252 and survived through to the 16th century; Decius also repaired the Colosseum, which had been damaged by lightning strikes.

==Persecution of Christians==


In late 249, Decius had issued one of the most remarkable Roman imperial edicts. From the numerous surviving texts from Egypt, recording the act of sacrifice, it appears that the edict itself was fairly clear:

According to D. S. Potter, Decius did not try to impose the superiority of the Roman pantheon over any other gods. It is very probable that the edict was an attempt to legitimize his position and to respond to a general unease provoked by the passing of the Roman millennium. While Decius himself may have intended the edict as a way to reaffirm his conservative vision of the Pax Romana and to reassure Rome&#x27;s citizens that the empire was still secure, it nevertheless sparked a &quot;terrible crisis of authority as various Christian bishops and their flocks reacted to it in different ways.&quot; Measures were first taken demanding that the bishops and officers of the church make a sacrifice for the emperor. The sacrifice was &quot;on behalf of&quot; (Latin &quot;pro&quot;) the emperor, not &quot;to&quot; the emperor, since a living emperor was not considered divine. Certificates were issued to those who satisfied the commissioners during the persecution of Christians under Decius. Forty-six such certificates have been published, all dating from 250, four of them from Oxyrhynchus. Anyone, including Christian followers, who refused to offer a sacrifice for the emperor and the Empire&#x27;s well-being by a specified date risked torture and execution. A number of prominent Christians did, in fact, refuse to make a sacrifice and were killed in the process, including Pope Fabian himself in 250, and &quot;anti-Christian feeling[s] led to killings at Carthage and Alexandria.&quot; However, towards the end of the second year of Decius&#x27; reign, &quot;the ferocity of the [anti-Christian] persecution had eased off, and the earlier tradition of tolerance had begun to reassert itself.&quot; Christians bore the brunt of the persecution and never forgot the reign of Decius, whom they remembered as &quot;that fierce tyrant&quot;. In June 251 Decius died alongside his co-emperor Herennius Etruscus in the Battle Abrittus against the Goths; their successors Trebonianus Gallus and Hostilian rescinded Decius&#x27;s decree, ending the persecution after approximately eighteen months.

At this time, there was a second outbreak of the Antonine Plague, which at its height from 251 to 266, took the lives of 5,000 daily in Rome. This outbreak is referred to as the &quot;Plague of Cyprian&quot; (Cyprian was the bishop of Carthage, where both the plague and the persecution of Christians were especially severe). Cyprian&#x27;s biographer Pontius gave a vivid picture of the demoralizing effects of the plague and Cyprian moralized the event in his essay &quot;De mortalitate&quot;. In Carthage, the &quot;Decian persecution&quot;, unleashed at the onset of the plague, sought out Christian scapegoats. Decius&#x27; edicts were renewed under Valerian in 253 and repealed under his son, Gallienus, in 260–261.

==Fighting the Goths and death==
===The Goths enter the Balkans===
The barbarian incursions into the Empire were becoming more daring and frequent whereas the Empire was facing a serious economic crisis in Decius&#x27; time. During his brief reign, Decius engaged in important operations against the Goths, who crossed the Danube to raid districts of Moesia and Thrace. This is the first considerable occasion that the Goths who would later come to play such an important role appear in the historical record. The Goths under King Cniva were surprised by the emperor while besieging Nicopolis on the Danube; the Goths fled through the difficult terrain of the Balkans, but then doubled back and surprised the Romans near Beroë (modern Stara Zagora), sacking their camp and dispersing the Roman troops (Battle of Beroe). The Goths then moved to attack Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv), which fell into their hands. The governor of Thrace, Titus Julius Priscus, declared himself emperor under Gothic protection in opposition to Decius but Priscus&#x27;s challenge was rendered moot when he was killed soon afterwards. Then the invaders began returning to their homeland, laden with booty and captives, among them many of senatorial rank.

===Battle of Abritus===
In the meantime, Decius had returned with his re-organized army, accompanied by his son Herennius Etruscus and the general Trebonianus Gallus, intending to defeat the invaders and recover the booty. The final engagement, the battle of Abritus, in which the Goths fought with the courage of despair, under the command of Cniva, took place during the second week of June 251 on swampy ground in the Ludogorie (region in northeastern Bulgaria which merges with Dobruja plateau and the Danube Plain to the north) near the small settlement of Abritus or &quot;Forum Terebronii&quot; (modern Razgrad). Jordanes records that Decius&#x27; son Herennius Etruscus was killed by an arrow early in the battle, and to cheer his men Decius exclaimed, &quot;Let no one mourn; the death of one soldier is not a great loss to the republic.&quot; Nevertheless, Decius&#x27; army was entangled in the swamp and annihilated in this battle, while he himself was killed on the field of battle. As the historian Aurelius Victor relates:

One literary tradition claims that Decius was betrayed by his successor, Trebonianus Gallus, who was involved in a secret alliance with the Goths, but this cannot be substantiated and was most likely a later invention since Gallus felt compelled to adopt Decius&#x27; younger son, Gaius Valens Hostilianus, as joint emperor even though the latter was too young to rule in his own right. It is also unlikely that the shattered Roman legions would proclaim as emperor a traitor who was responsible for the loss of so many soldiers from their ranks. Decius was the first Roman emperor to die in battle against a foreign enemy.

== Legacy ==
The Decian persecution was the first organized persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire and served as the basis for the Diocletianic Persecution, the last major persecution of Christians in the Empire.

The later telling of the Seven Sleepers, about seven Christian youths from Ephesus who fled the Decian persecution by hiding in a cave (walled up by Decius) and sleeping for almost 300 years, emerged. The Quranic account, captured in Al-Kahf (&quot;The Cave&quot;) surah (chapter), has led to the Persian saying of &quot;ahd-e daqyānus&quot; (&quot;age of Decius&quot;) or &quot;daqyānus&quot; referring to ancient times or a person with outdated views. When something is old and outdated, people say, &quot;this belongs to the age of Decius.&quot;

<text>Lubusz Voivodeship ( ) is a voivodeship (province) in western Poland.

It was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Gorzów Voivodeship and Zielona Góra Voivodeship, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. The province&#x27;s name recalls the historic Lubusz Land (&quot;Lebus&quot; or &quot;Lubus&quot;), although parts of the voivodeship belong to the historic regions of Lower Silesia, Greater Poland, and Lusatia.

The functions of regional capital are shared between two cities: Gorzów Wielkopolski and Zielona Góra. Gorzów serves as the seat of the centrally-appointed voivode, or governor, and Zielona Góra is the seat of the elected regional assembly (sejmik) and the executive elected by that assembly, headed by a marshal (&quot;marszałek&quot;). In addition, the voivodeship includes a third city (Nowa Sól) and a number of towns. 

The region is mainly flat, with many lakes and woodlands. In the south, around Zielona Góra, grapes are cultivated.

Lubusz Voivodeship borders West Pomeranian Voivodeship to the north, Greater Poland Voivodeship to the east, Lower Silesian Voivodeship to the south, and Germany (Brandenburg and Saxony) to the west.

==History==

The first leaders of the Polans, Mieszko I and especially Bolesław I the Brave added a number of surrounding territories to the newly established core Polish state, and Lubusz Land came under Polish rule. Part of the historic province was located on the western bank of the Oder River, where the main settlement Lubusz, later known as the German town of Lebus, was located. The entire territory of the present Lubusz Voivodeship was part of Poland by 1002. The oldest towns in the region, dating back over 1,000 years, include Trzciel, Skwierzyna, Iłowa, Szprotawa, Jasień, Krosno Odrzańskie, Międzyrzecz and Żary, with most other towns also founded in the Middle Ages, including the current regional capitals of Zielona Góra and Gorzów Wielkopolski. The youngest towns are Łęknica, Czerwieńsk, Nowa Sól, Szlichtyngowa and Zbąszynek, all either first mentioned or established in the later periods.
Following the fragmentation of Poland into smaller provincial duchies, various portions of the present Lubusz Voivodeship were part of various duchies, initially the duchies of Greater Poland and Silesia, and later also Legnica, Głogów, Lubusz and Żagań, ruled by various lines of the Piast dynasty. Overtime, portions of the present Lubusz Voivodeship were lost by Poland. In 1250 the Lubusz Land was acquired by the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. In 1319–1326 it was contested by various Polish and German rulers, before falling back to Brandenburg. After Brandenburg passed to the Bohemian Crown in 1373, Poland made a peaceful attempt to regain the northern portion of the area. In 1402, the Bohemian rulers reached an agreement with Poland in Kraków. Poland was to buy and re-incorporate the northern outskirts of the present Lubusz Voivodeship, but eventually the Bohemian rulers sold the area to the Teutonic Order, who in turn sold it back to Brandenburg in 1454 to raise funds for war against Poland. The southern part of the current voivodeship remained part of the duchies of Żagań and Głogów, ruled by the houses of Piast and Jagiellon, with the Żagań duchy eventually passing to houses of foreign background, including Czech, Saxon and French, whereas other areas were gradually incorporated directly into the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1635, most of the south-western part of the present Lubusz Voivodeship passed from Bohemia to Saxony, and from 1697 formed part of Poland-Saxony. In the 18th century, Wschowa was an important royal city of Poland, as it often hosted Polish kings and several sessions of the Polish Senate, hence being dubbed the &quot;unofficial capital of Poland&quot;. King Augustus III of Poland also often stopped in Brody.
In 1701, the Kingdom of Prussia was established, which included Brandenburg-held Lubusz Land, and various areas were eventually gradually annexed by Prussia in the following centuries, starting with the south-eastern part of the current voivodeship in 1742, followed by eastern portions (western outskirts of Greater Poland) in 1793 (briefly regained by Poles in 1807–1815 as part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw), and the south-western part in 1815. Within Prussia and Germany the territory was divided between the provinces of Neumark/Brandenburg, South Prussia/Posen, and Silesia/Lower Silesia.

During World War II, the Oflag II-C, Stalag III-C, Stalag VIII-C and Stalag Luft III major German prisoner-of-war camps for Polish, French, British, Belgian, Canadian, Serbian, Italian, American, Australian, New Zealander, Soviet, Norwegian, Czech, Slovak, South African, Dutch, Greek, Yugoslav, Senegalese, Algerian and Moroccan POWs were operated in the territory. The latter was the site of the &quot;Great Escape&quot; in 1944. There are museums at the site of the camps in Dobiegniew and Żagań, and there is a memorial to the victims of the Stalag Luft III murders in Żagań. Particularly infamous camps in the region were the Oderblick labor education camp in Świecko and the Sonnenburg concentration camp in Słońsk, in which Polish, Belgian, French, Bulgarian, Dutch, Yugoslav, Russian, Italian, Ukrainian, Luxembourgish, Danish, Norwegian, Czech, Slovak and other prisoners were held, and many died. There were also eleven subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp and a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, in which mostly Jewish and Polish, but also French, Russian, Czech, Italian, Greek, Yugoslav, Dutch, Romanian, Hungarian, Lithuanian and German prisoners were held. Obrzyce was the place of &quot;Aktion T4&quot; murders of mentally ill and disabled people. The region was the site of fierce fighting during the war in 1945. During the liberation of the Stalag III-C camp, Soviet troops killed some American POWs mistaking them for enemy troops. On 18 March 1945, the Germans shot down an American bomber near Bucze.
Under the terms laid down by Joseph Stalin in the Potsdam Agreement, the borders of Poland and Germany were redrawn and the area of the Lubusz Voivodeship fell within the new borders of Poland.

In 1998, the government of Jerzy Buzek decided to introduce an administrative reform, with its principles including the restoration of counties and a steep reduction in the number of voivodeships. A general consensus existed among scholars that the local administration exercised through the 49 existing voivodeships established in 1975 was inefficient, anachronistic, impractical, detrimental to maintaining regional identity, and untenable. However, the reform draft accepted by the government surprised the public and caused widespread outcry, as its authors foresaw creation of only 12 large voivodships, thus going much further than the widely expected reconstitution of the 17 voivodeships existing prior to the 1975 reform. As a consequence, the original draft made no provision for a separate Lubusz voivodeship – Gorzów was to become along with Kostrzyn, Strzelce Krajeńskie and Drezdenko a part of West Pomeranian Voivodeship, Zielona Góra was to be included along with Krosno, Nowa Sól, Żagań, Gubin and Żary in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, while a narrow horizontal strip encompassing Międzyrzecz, Sulęcin, Świebodzin, Słubice and Sulechów was to be assigned to the Greater Poland Voivodeship as a bizarre sort-of corridor to the German border. However, mass protests broke out as a result in the cities such as Bydgoszcz, Koszalin, Opole or Kielce. Many of the people opposing the draft reform initially demanded retaining as many as 25 voivodeships (including the 2 ones seated in Gorzów and Zielona Góra), a number nevertheless widely regarded as a demand intentionally excessive to serve as an initial negotiating bargain, actually aiming to restore the 17 voivodeships existing prior to 1975 as an ultimate compromise. As Poland was at the time governed under political cohabitation, the opposition party constituting the political background of the President decided to capitalize on the popular discontent which erupted against the government on an unanticipated scale; the most obvious mean readily available for the opposition was a presidential veto, which in fact ensued. In order to salvage the reform from being killed altogether, the government was, in the face of lacking the supermajority required to overturn the veto at the time, forced to reconsider the original shape of the reform and to reconcile it with the reservations of the President and his political background, with the result of a compromise adjustment increasing the number of voivodeships to 16, with Lubusz Voivodeship included among the four additional ones created according to the agreement.
The path leading to such and outcome was far from smooth. The government made an effort to highlight and exploit the decades-long animosity between the approximately same-size two principal cities, spreading scare against its inevitable re-ignition and explosion in any of these two cities after designating the other one as the voivodeship capital, and hoping to use the engineered scare as the main argument in the ongoing discussions against creating the Lubusz voivodeship, The animosity, existing indeed between the cities, has been historically rooted in a widespread perception among Gorzów inhabitants that the 1950 decision to designate Zielona Góra as the voivodeship capital instead of their larger and more populous city, was taken by the anticlerical communist government due to a hidden motivation of punishing Gorzów for becoming the see of the newly established Roman Catholic apostolic administration governing the majority of the Recovered Territories, with the ensuing discrimination of the city by the voivodeship authorities in the years 1950–1975 in terms of establishing any new public cultural and educational institutions, other public investments or public funds allocations, in vivid contrast to the unjust favoring of their own seat, the city of Zielona Góra; a sentiment reinforced further by the surprise relocation of the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gorzów to Zielona Góra in 1992, renamed as a result the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów, and finally and perhaps most importantly, by the historical, perpetual and almost sacred rivalry between the motorcycle speedway clubs located in both cities. The objective of the local elites in Zielona Góra was in turn to become a single capital centre, reverting to the situation before 1975, while any prospect of sharing the governing institutions was for a long time treated with their hostility. In spite of that, the looming threat of a &quot;everybody lose&quot; scenario set to materialize in case of a possible implementation of the original reform draft, paved the way for neutralizing this argument through forcing both rival sides into the breakthrough reconciliation accord known as the Paradyż Agreement, brokered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Zielona Góra-Gorzów and formalized in a document signed during a highly publicized local summit in the Gościkowo-Paradyż Abbey on 13 March 1998. This compromise agreement, was negotiated and concluded between the delegations of both rival cities, composed of the respectively aligned most powerful local and national scene politicians and business people, with its most important provision being the unusual arrangement to divide and distribute the governing institutions of the voivodeship more or less equally between the two cities. On the basis of this broadly supported agreement, an effective public pressure endorsed jointly by the two centers was successfully exerted on the central government which ultimately acquiesced to the demand of establishing Lubusz Voivodeship. 
Nevertheless, creating any new type of public institution at voivodeship level in Poland continues to ignite almost automatically a fierce battle in the Lubusz Voivodeship regarding the seat of the institution. There have also been numerous attempts to relocate some of the existing public institutions under various pretexts from one city to another, in some cases successful, as well as of merging a pair of equal institutions of a type existing in both cities, in order to make one of them a branch of the other, with obscure or no justification in most cases for such merger. Nevertheless, a general local majority consensus prevails that the compromise, although unsatisfactory for any of the two cities, spared both of them the fate of a number of cities which lost in 1999 entirely the status of a voivodeship capital and all voivodeship-level institutions, along with the associated attractiveness and prestige of the city as a place to live, crucial for its growth, with the ensuing profoundly detrimental phenomena.

==Geography==
The Lubusz Voivodeship is a land of forests and lakes; forests cover 48% of the area. The river Oder, flowing through the voivodeship, is one of the few large European rivers retaining broadleaved and riparian forests. Areas with the highest natural values are protected as national parks (Drawa National Park and Warta Mouth National Park), landscape parks and wildlife reserves. The 19th century Muskau Park, located on both sides of the Polish–German border, has entered the UNESCO World Heritage List. The voivodeship abounds in lakes, especially in its central and northern parts; around those lakes numerous bathing resorts, holiday centres and farms offering tourist services have been established.

==Cuisine==
The voivodeship, especially its northern part, is a notable for production of honey, with several varieties listed as traditional foods by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, and the Saint Michael&#x27;s Honey Fair held annually in Gorzów Wielkopolski.

The southern part of the voivodeship with Zielona Góra is one of the leading winemaking regions of Poland, and other traditional beverages from the voivodeship are beer, mead, nalewki and vodka.

Various types of traditional Polish kiełbasa, also designated as traditional foods by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, are produced in the Nowa Sól, Wschowa, Zielona Góra, Żagań and Żary counties in the southern part of the Lubusz Voivodeship, whereas Siedlisko, Nowa Sól County produces a variety of traditional cheeses and quarks.

==Cities and towns==


The voivodeship contains 3 cities and 40 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (as of 2021):
==Administrative division==
Lubusz Voivodeship is divided into 14 counties (powiats): 2 city counties and 12 land counties. These are further divided into 82 gminas.

The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).
==Economy==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 10.8 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 2.2% of Polish economic output. The GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 17,600 euros or 58% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 67% of the EU average.
==Transport==
The sole airport in the voivodeship is the Zielona Góra Airport. The A2, A18 and S3 highways pass through the province.

==Protected areas==
Protected areas in Lubusz Voivodeship include two national parks and eight landscape parks. These are listed below.
*Drawa National Park (partly in Greater Poland and West Pomeranian Voivodeships)

Furthermore, there are several preserved old towns with historic town halls and market squares (i.e. Zielona Góra, Wschowa, Świebodzin and Bytom Odrzański). Of the historic town halls, the one in Kargowa was the site of an armed defense against the annexation by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Several towns contain entirely or partly preserved medieval town walls with towers and gates, i.e. Kożuchów, Strzelce Krajeńskie, Gorzów Wielkopolski, Wschowa. There are multiple castles, including Piast Royal and Ducal castles in Krosno Odrzańskie, Kożuchów, Międzyrzecz and Żagań. There are also numerous palaces, including at Brody, Dąbrówka Wielkopolska, Glisno, Jędrzychowice, Kalsk, Mierzęcin, Trzebiechów, Żary. The village of Łagów, which hosted the Knights Templar and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in the past, contains the Castle of the Order of St. John, and several other medieval structures. Kostrzyn nad Odrą and its surroundings contain fortifications of the Kostrzyn Fortress with Fort Sarbinowo, which housed a German strict regime prisoner-of-war camp for Allied officers during World War I, considered the only German WWI POW camp from which no one managed to escape.

Major museums dedicated to the history of the region are located in Gorzów Wielkopolski and Zielona Góra. There are museums dedicated to Allied prisoners of war at the former German POW camps in Dobiegniew and Żagań. In Żagań, there is a memorial to the victims of the Stalag Luft III murders of Allied POWs, perpetrated by Nazi Germany in World War II. There are multiple other memorials to victims of Nazi Germany in the region. In Bucze there is a memorial to American airmen shot down by the Germans in 1945. The garrison town of Żagań hosts Poland&#x27;s oldest monument of Wojtek, the soldier bear of the Polish II Corps.

&quot;Kuna&quot;, the world&#x27;s oldest in service river icebreaker, is docked in the river port of Gorzów Wielkopolski and is open to the public as a museum ship.

One of the world&#x27;s tallest Christ statues, the Christ the King Statue is located in Świebodzin, whereas Słubice hosts the Wikipedia Monument.

==Sports==

Motorcycle speedway enjoys a large following in the province with the Stal Gorzów Wielkopolski and Falubaz Zielona Góra clubs being among the most accomplished in the sport in the country. The teams contest the Lubusz Voivodeship Derby, one of the fiercest speedway rivalries.

<text>Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger ( ; AD 65), usually known mononymously as Seneca, was a Stoic philosopher of Ancient Rome, a statesman, dramatist, and in one work, satirist, from the post-Augustan age of Latin literature.

Seneca was born in Colonia Patricia Corduba in Hispania, and was trained in rhetoric and philosophy in Rome. His father was Seneca the Elder, his elder brother was Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus, and his nephew was the poet Lucan. In AD 41, Seneca was exiled to the island of Corsica under emperor Claudius, but was allowed to return in 49 to become a tutor to Nero. When Nero became emperor in 54, Seneca became his advisor and, together with the praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, provided competent government for the first five years of Nero&#x27;s reign. Seneca&#x27;s influence over Nero declined with time, and in 65 Seneca was executed by forced suicide for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero, of which he was probably innocent. His stoic and calm suicide has become the subject of numerous paintings.

As a writer, Seneca is known for his philosophical works, and for his plays, which are all tragedies. His prose works include 12 essays and 124 letters dealing with moral issues. These writings constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for ancient Stoicism. As a tragedian, he is best known for plays such as his &quot;Medea&quot;, &quot;Thyestes&quot;, and &quot;Phaedra&quot;. Seneca had an immense influence on later generations—during the Renaissance he was &quot;a sage admired and venerated as an oracle of moral, even of Christian edification; a master of literary style and a model [for] dramatic art.&quot;

==Life==
===Early life, family and adulthood===
Seneca was born in Córdoba in the Roman province of Baetica in Hispania. His branch of the Annaea gens consisted of Italic colonists, of Umbrian or Paelignian origins. His father was Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Elder, a Spanish-born Roman knight who had gained fame as a writer and teacher of rhetoric in Rome. Seneca&#x27;s mother, Helvia, was from a prominent Baetician family. Seneca was the second of three brothers; the others were Lucius Annaeus Novatus (later known as Junius Gallio), and Annaeus Mela, the father of the poet Lucan. Miriam Griffin says in her biography of Seneca that &quot;the evidence for Seneca&#x27;s life before his exile in 41 is so slight, and the potential interest of these years, for social history, as well as for biography, is so great that few writers on Seneca have resisted the temptation to eke out knowledge with imagination.&quot; Griffin also infers from the ancient sources that Seneca was born in either 8, 4, or 1 BC. She thinks he was born between 4 and 1 BC and was resident in Rome by AD 5.
Seneca is said to have been taken to Rome in the &quot;arms&quot; of his aunt (his mother&#x27;s stepsister) at a young age, probably when he was about five years old. His father resided for much of his life in the city. Seneca was taught the usual subjects of literature, grammar, and rhetoric, as part of the standard education of high-born Romans. While still young he received philosophical training from Attalus the Stoic, and from Sotion and Papirius Fabianus, both of whom belonged to the short-lived School of the Sextii, which combined Stoicism with Pythagoreanism. Sotion persuaded Seneca when he was a young man (in his early twenties) to become a vegetarian, which he practiced for around a year before his father urged him to desist because the practice was associated with &quot;some foreign rites&quot;. Seneca often had breathing difficulties throughout his life, probably asthma, and at some point in his mid-twenties () he appears to have been struck down with tuberculosis. He was sent to Egypt to live with his aunt (the same aunt who had brought him to Rome), whose husband Gaius Galerius had become Prefect of Egypt. She nursed him through a period of ill health that lasted up to ten years. In 31 AD he returned to Rome with his aunt, his uncle dying en route in a shipwreck. His aunt&#x27;s influence helped Seneca be elected quaestor (probably after AD 37), which also earned him the right to sit in the Roman Senate.

===Politics and exile===
Seneca&#x27;s early career as a senator seems to have been successful and he was praised for his oratory. In his writings Seneca has nothing good to say about Caligula and frequently depicts him as a monster. Cassius Dio relates a story that Caligula was so offended by Seneca&#x27;s oratorical success in the Senate that he ordered him to commit suicide. Seneca survived only because he was seriously ill and Caligula was told that he would soon die anyway. Seneca explains his own survival as due to his patience and his devotion to his friends: &quot;I wanted to avoid the impression that all I could do for loyalty was die.&quot;

In AD 41, Claudius became emperor, and Seneca was accused by the new empress Messalina of adultery with Julia Livilla, sister to Caligula and Agrippina. The affair has been doubted by some historians, since Messalina had clear political motives for getting rid of Julia Livilla and her supporters. The Senate pronounced a death sentence on Seneca, which Claudius commuted to exile, and Seneca spent the next eight years on the island of Corsica. Two of Seneca&#x27;s earliest surviving works date from the period of his exile—both consolations. In his &quot;Consolation to Helvia&quot;, his mother, Seneca comforts her as a bereaved mother for losing her son to exile. Seneca incidentally mentions the death of his only son, a few weeks before his exile. Later in life Seneca was married to a woman younger than himself, Pompeia Paulina. It has been thought that the infant son may have been from an earlier marriage, but the evidence is &quot;tenuous&quot;. Seneca&#x27;s other work of this period, his &quot;Consolation to Polybius&quot;, one of Claudius&#x27; freedmen, focused on consoling Polybius on the death of his brother. It is noted for its flattery of Claudius, and Seneca expresses his hope that the emperor will recall him from exile. In 49 AD Agrippina married her uncle Claudius, and through her influence Seneca was recalled to Rome. Agrippina gained the praetorship for Seneca and appointed him tutor to her son, the future emperor Nero.

===Imperial advisor===

From AD 54 to 62, Seneca acted as Nero&#x27;s advisor, together with the praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus. Early in Nero&#x27;s reign, his mother Agrippina exercised his authority to make decisions. Seneca and Burrus opposed this authoritarian matriarchy which had become the cause of irresponsibility of the emperor. One by-product of his new position was that Seneca was appointed suffect consul in 56. Seneca&#x27;s influence was said to have been especially strong in the first year. Seneca composed Nero&#x27;s accession speeches in which he promised to restore proper legal procedure and authority to the Senate. He also composed the eulogy for Claudius that Nero delivered at the funeral. Seneca&#x27;s satirical skit &quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;, which lampoons the deification of Claudius and praises Nero, dates from the earliest period of Nero&#x27;s reign. In AD 55, Seneca wrote &quot;On Clemency&quot; following Nero&#x27;s murder of Britannicus, perhaps to assure the citizenry that the murder was the end, not the beginning of bloodshed. &quot;On Clemency&quot; is a work which, although it flatters Nero, was intended to show the correct (Stoic) path of virtue for a ruler. Tacitus and Dio suggest that Nero&#x27;s early rule, during which he listened to Seneca and Burrus, was quite competent. However, the ancient sources suggest that, over time, Seneca and Burrus lost their influence over the emperor. In 59 they had reluctantly agreed to Agrippina&#x27;s murder, and afterward Tacitus reports that Seneca had to write a letter justifying the murder to the Senate.

In AD 58 the senator Publius Suillius Rufus made a series of public attacks on Seneca. These attacks, reported by Tacitus and Cassius Dio, included charges that, in a mere four years of service to Nero, Seneca had acquired a vast personal fortune of three hundred million sestertii by charging high interest on loans throughout Italy and the provinces. Suillius&#x27; attacks included claims of sexual corruption, with a suggestion that Seneca had slept with Agrippina. Tacitus, though, reports that Suillius was highly prejudiced: he had been a favorite of Claudius, and had been an embezzler and informant. In response, Seneca brought a series of prosecutions for corruption against Suillius: half of his estate was confiscated and he was sent into exile. However, the attacks reflect a criticism of Seneca that was made at the time and continued through later ages. Seneca was undoubtedly extremely rich: he had properties at Baiae and Nomentum, an Alban villa, and Egyptian estates. Cassius Dio even reports that the Boudica uprising in Britannia was caused by Seneca forcing large loans on the indigenous British aristocracy in the aftermath of Claudius&#x27;s conquest of Britain, and then calling them in suddenly and aggressively. Seneca was sensitive to such accusations: his &quot;De Vita Beata&quot; (&quot;On the Happy Life&quot;) dates from around this time and includes a defense of wealth along Stoic lines, arguing that properly gaining and spending wealth is appropriate behavior for a philosopher.

===Retirement===
After Burrus&#x27;s death in 62, Seneca&#x27;s influence declined rapidly; as Tacitus puts it (Ann. 14.52.1), &quot;mors Burri infregit Senecae potentiam&quot; (&quot;the death of Burrus broke Seneca&#x27;s power&quot;). Tacitus reports that Seneca tried to retire twice, in 62 and AD 64, but Nero refused him on both occasions. Nevertheless, Seneca was increasingly absent from the court. He adopted a quiet lifestyle on his country estates, concentrating on his studies and seldom visiting Rome. It was during these final few years that he composed two of his greatest works: &quot;Naturales quaestiones&quot;—an encyclopedia of the natural world; and his &quot;Letters to Lucilius&quot;—which document his philosophical thoughts.
===Death===

In AD 65, Seneca was caught up in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy, a plot to kill Nero. Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy, Nero ordered him to kill himself. Seneca followed tradition by severing several veins in order to bleed to death, and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to share his fate. Cassius Dio, who wished to emphasize the relentlessness of Nero, focused on how Seneca had attended to his last-minute letters, and how his death was hastened by soldiers. A generation after the Julio-Claudian emperors, Tacitus wrote an account of the suicide, which, in view of his republican sympathies, is perhaps somewhat romanticized. According to this account, Nero ordered Seneca&#x27;s wife saved. Her wounds were bound up and she made no further attempt to kill herself. As for Seneca himself, his age and diet were blamed for slow loss of blood and extended pain rather than a quick death. He also took poison, which was not fatal. 
After dictating his last words to a scribe, and with a circle of friends attending him in his home, he immersed himself in a warm bath, which he expected would speed blood flow and ease his pain. Tacitus wrote, &quot;He was then carried into a bath, with the steam of which he was suffocated, and he was burnt without any of the usual funeral rites. So he had directed in a codicil of his will, even when in the height of his wealth and power he was thinking of life&#x27;s close.&quot; This may give the impression of a favorable portrait of Seneca, but Tacitus&#x27;s treatment of him is at best ambivalent. Alongside Seneca&#x27;s apparent fortitude in the face of death, for example, one can also view his actions as rather histrionic and performative; and when Tacitus tells us that he left his family an &quot;imago suae vitae&quot; (&quot;Annales&quot; 15.62), &quot;an image of his life&quot;, he is possibly being ambiguous: in Roman culture, the &quot;imago&quot; was a kind of mask that commemorated the great ancestors of noble families, but at the same time, it may also suggest duplicity, superficiality, and pretense.

==Philosophy==
As &quot;a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period&quot;, Seneca&#x27;s lasting contribution to philosophy has been to the school of Stoicism. His writing is highly accessible and was the subject of attention from the Renaissance onwards by writers such as Michel de Montaigne. 

Seneca wrote a number of books on Stoicism, mostly on ethics, with one work (&quot;Naturales Quaestiones&quot;) on the physical world. Seneca built on the writings of many of the earlier Stoics: he often mentions Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus; and frequently cites Posidonius, with whom Seneca shared an interest in natural phenomena. He frequently quotes Epicurus, especially in his &quot;Letters&quot;. His interest in Epicurus is mainly limited to using him as a source of ethical maxims. Likewise Seneca shows some interest in Platonist metaphysics, but never with any clear commitment. His moral essays are based on Stoic doctrines. Stoicism was a popular philosophy in this period, and many upper-class Romans found in it a guiding ethical framework for political involvement. It was once popular to regard Seneca as being very eclectic in his Stoicism, but modern scholarship views him as a fairly orthodox Stoic, albeit a free-minded one.

His works discuss both ethical theory and practical advice, and Seneca stresses that both parts are distinct but interdependent. His &quot;Letters to Lucilius&quot; showcase Seneca&#x27;s search for ethical perfection. Seneca regards philosophy as a balm for the wounds of life. The destructive passions, especially anger and grief, must be uprooted, or moderated according to reason. He discusses the relative merits of the contemplative life and the active life, and he considers it important to confront one&#x27;s own mortality and be able to face death. One must be willing to practice poverty and use wealth properly, and he writes about favours, clemency, the importance of friendship, and the need to benefit others. The universe is governed for the best by a rational providence, and this must be reconciled with acceptance of adversity.

==Drama==


Ten plays are attributed to Seneca, of which most likely eight were written by him. The plays stand in stark contrast to his philosophical works. With their intense emotions, and grim overall tone, the plays seem to represent the antithesis of Seneca&#x27;s Stoic beliefs. Up to the 16th century it was normal to distinguish between Seneca the moral philosopher and Seneca the dramatist as two separate people. Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes: it is the uncontrolled passions that generate madness, ruination, and self-destruction. This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect, and fate is a powerful, albeit rather oppressive, force.

Many scholars have thought, following the ideas of the 19th-century German scholar Friedrich Leo, that Seneca&#x27;s tragedies were written for recitation only. Other scholars think that they were written for performance and that it is possible that actual performance took place in Seneca&#x27;s lifetime. Ultimately, this issue cannot be resolved on the basis of our existing knowledge. The tragedies of Seneca have been successfully staged in modern times.

The dating of the tragedies is highly problematic in the absence of any ancient references. A parody of a lament from &quot;Hercules Furens&quot; appears in the &quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;, which implies a date before AD 54 for that play. A relative chronology has been proposed on metrical grounds. The plays are not all based on the Greek pattern; they have a five-act form and differ in many respects from extant Attic drama, and while the influence of Euripides on some of these works is considerable, so is the influence of Virgil and Ovid.

Seneca&#x27;s plays were widely read in medieval and Renaissance European universities and strongly influenced tragic drama in that time, such as Elizabethan England (William Shakespeare and other playwrights), France (Corneille and Racine), and the Netherlands (Joost van den Vondel). English translations of Seneca&#x27;s tragedies appeared in print in the mid-16th century, with all ten published collectively in 1581. He is regarded as the source and inspiration for what is known as &quot;Revenge Tragedy&quot;, starting with Thomas Kyd&#x27;s &quot;The Spanish Tragedy&quot; and continuing well into the Jacobean era. &quot;Thyestes&quot; is considered Seneca&#x27;s masterpiece, and has been described by scholar Dana Gioia as &quot;one of the most influential plays ever written&quot;. &quot;Medea&quot; is also highly regarded, and was praised along with &quot;Phaedra&quot; by T. S. Eliot.

==Works==
Works attributed to Seneca include 12 philosophical essays, 124 letters dealing with moral issues, nine tragedies, and a satire, the attribution of which is disputed. His authorship of &quot;Hercules on Oeta&quot; has also been questioned.

===Seneca&#x27;s tragedies===
&quot;Fabulae crepidatae&quot; (tragedies with Greek subjects):
* &quot;Hercules&quot; or &quot;Hercules furens&quot; (&quot;The Madness of Hercules&quot;)
* &quot;Troades&quot; (&quot;The Trojan Women&quot;)
* &quot;Phoenissae&quot; (&quot;The Phoenician Women&quot;)
* &quot;Medea&quot;
* &quot;Phaedra&quot;
* &quot;Oedipus&quot;
* &quot;Agamemnon&quot;
* &quot;Thyestes&quot;
* &quot;Hercules Oetaeus&quot; (&quot;Hercules on Oeta&quot;): generally considered not written by Seneca. First rejected by Daniël Heinsius.

&quot;Fabula praetexta&quot; (tragedy in Roman setting):
* &quot;Octavia&quot;: almost certainly not written by Seneca (at least in its final form) since it contains accurate prophecies of both his and Nero&#x27;s deaths. This play closely resembles Seneca&#x27;s plays in style, but was probably written some time after Seneca&#x27;s death (perhaps under Vespasian) by someone influenced by Seneca and aware of the events of his lifetime. Though attributed textually to Seneca, the attribution was early questioned by Petrarch, and rejected by Justus Lipsius.

===Editions===

==Legacy==
===As a proto-Christian saint===
Seneca&#x27;s writings were well known in the later Roman period, and Quintilian, writing thirty years after Seneca&#x27;s death, remarked on the popularity of his works amongst the youth. While he found much to admire, Quintillian criticized Seneca for what he regarded as a degenerate literary style—a criticism echoed by Aulus Gellius in the middle of the 2nd century.

The early Christian Church was very favourably disposed towards Seneca and his writings, and the church leader Tertullian possessively referred to him as &quot;our Seneca&quot;. By the 4th century an apocryphal correspondence with Paul the Apostle had been created linking Seneca into the Christian tradition. The letters are mentioned by Jerome who also included Seneca among a list of Christian writers, and Seneca is similarly mentioned by Augustine. In the 6th century Martin of Braga synthesized Seneca&#x27;s thought into a couple of treatises that became popular in their own right. Otherwise, Seneca was mainly known through a large number of quotes and extracts in the &quot;florilegia&quot;, which were popular throughout the medieval period. When his writings were read in the later Middle Ages, it was mostly his &quot;Letters to Lucilius&quot;—the longer essays and plays being relatively unknown.

Medieval writers and works continued to link him to Christianity because of his alleged association with Paul. The &quot;Golden Legend&quot;, a 13th-century hagiographical account of famous saints that was widely read, included an account of Seneca&#x27;s death scene, and erroneously presented Nero as a witness to Seneca&#x27;s suicide. Dante placed Seneca (alongside Cicero) among the &quot;great spirits&quot; in the First Circle of Hell, or Limbo. Boccaccio, who in 1370 came across the works of Tacitus whilst browsing the library at Montecassino, wrote an account of Seneca&#x27;s suicide hinting that it was a kind of disguised baptism, or a &quot;de facto&quot; baptism in spirit. Some, such as Albertino Mussato and Giovanni Colonna, went even further and concluded that Seneca must have been a Christian convert.

===Disputed quotations===
Various other antique and medieval texts purport to be by Seneca, &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;De remediis fortuitorum&quot;, but with unconfirmed authorship, they have sometimes been referred-to as &quot;Pseudo-Seneca&quot;. At least some of these seem to preserve and adapt genuine Senecan content, for example, Saint Martin of Braga&#x27;s (d. c. 580) &quot;Formula vitae honestae&quot;, or &quot;De differentiis quatuor virtutum vitae honestae&quot; (&quot;Rules for an Honest Life&quot;, or &quot;On the Four Cardinal Virtues&quot;). Early manuscripts preserve Martin&#x27;s preface, where he makes it clear that this was his adaptation, but in later copies this was omitted, and the work was later thought fully Seneca&#x27;s work.

===An improving reputation===
Seneca remains one of the few popular Roman philosophers from the period. He appears not only in Dante, but also in Chaucer and to a large degree in Petrarch, who adopted his style in his own essays and who quotes him more than any other authority except Virgil. In the Renaissance, printed editions and translations of his works became common, including an edition by Erasmus and a commentary by John Calvin. John of Salisbury, Erasmus and others celebrated his works. French essayist Montaigne, who gave a spirited defense of Seneca and Plutarch in his &quot;Essays&quot;, was himself considered by Pasquier a &quot;French Seneca&quot;. Similarly, Thomas Fuller praised Joseph Hall as &quot;our English Seneca&quot;. Many who considered his ideas not particularly original still argued that he was important in making the Greek philosophers presentable and intelligible. His suicide has also been a popular subject in art, from Jacques-Louis David&#x27;s 1773 painting &quot;The Death of Seneca&quot; to the 1951 film &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;.

Even with the admiration of an earlier group of intellectual stalwarts, Seneca has never been without his detractors. In his own time, he was accused of hypocrisy or, at least, a less than &quot;Stoic&quot; lifestyle. While banished to Corsica, he wrote a plea for restoration rather incompatible with his advocacy of a simple life and the acceptance of fate. In his &quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot; he ridiculed the behaviors and policies of Claudius, and flattered Nero—such as proclaiming that Nero would live longer and be wiser than the legendary Nestor. The claims of Publius Suillius Rufus that Seneca acquired some &quot;three hundred million &quot;sesterces&quot;&quot; through Nero&#x27;s favor are highly partisan, but they reflect the reality that Seneca was both powerful and wealthy. Robin Campbell, a translator of Seneca&#x27;s letters, writes that the &quot;stock criticism of Seneca right down the centuries [has been]...the apparent contrast between his philosophical teachings and his practice.&quot;

In 1562 Gerolamo Cardano wrote an &quot;apology&quot; praising Nero in his &quot;Encomium Neronis&quot;, printed in Basel. This was likely intended as a mock &quot;encomium&quot;, inverting the portrayal of Nero and Seneca that appears in Tacitus. In this work Cardano portrayed Seneca as a crook of the worst kind, an empty rhetorician who was only thinking to grab money and power, after having poisoned the mind of the young emperor. Cardano stated that Seneca well deserved death.

Among the historians who have sought to reappraise Seneca is the scholar Anna Lydia Motto, who in 1966 argued that the negative image has been based almost entirely on Suillius&#x27;s account, while many others who might have lauded him have been lost.
&quot;We are therefore left with no contemporary record of Seneca&#x27;s life, save for the desperate opinion of Publius Suillius. Think of the barren image we should have of Socrates, had the works of Plato and Xenophon not come down to us and were we wholly dependent upon Aristophanes&#x27; description of this Athenian philosopher. To be sure, we should have a highly distorted, misconstrued view. Such is the view left to us of Seneca, if we were to rely upon Suillius alone.&quot; 

More recent work is changing the dominant perception of Seneca as a mere conduit for pre-existing ideas, showing originality in Seneca&#x27;s contribution to the history of ideas. Examination of Seneca&#x27;s life and thought in relation to contemporary education and to the psychology of emotions is revealing the relevance of his thought. For example, Martha Nussbaum in her discussion of desire and emotion includes Seneca among the Stoics who offered important insights and perspectives on emotions and their role in our lives. Specifically devoting a chapter to his treatment of anger and its management, she shows Seneca&#x27;s appreciation of the damaging role of uncontrolled anger, and its pathological connections. Nussbaum later extended her examination to Seneca&#x27;s contribution to political philosophy showing considerable subtlety and richness in his thoughts about politics, education, and notions of global citizenship—and finding a basis for reform-minded education in Seneca&#x27;s ideas she used to propose a mode of modern education that avoids both narrow traditionalism and total rejection of tradition. Elsewhere Seneca has been noted as the first great Western thinker on the complex nature and role of gratitude in human relationships.

==In popular culture==

* The movie &quot;Seneca&quot; was released in 2023, narrating his life

===Notable fictional portrayals===
Seneca is a character in Monteverdi&#x27;s 1642 opera &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; (&quot;The Coronation of Poppea&quot;), which is based on the pseudo-Senecan play, &quot;Octavia&quot;. 

* In Nathaniel Lee&#x27;s 1675 play &quot;Nero, Emperor of Rome&quot;, Seneca attempts to dissuade Nero from his egomaniacal plans, but is dragged off to prison, dying off-stage. 
* Seneca appears in Robert Bridges&#x27; verse drama &quot;Nero&quot;, the second part of which (published 1894) culminates in Seneca&#x27;s death. 
* Seneca also appears in a fairly minor role in Henryk Sienkiewicz&#x27;s 1896 novel &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; and was played by Nicholas Hannen in the 1951 film. 
* In Robert Graves&#x27;s 1934 book &quot;Claudius the God&quot;, the sequel novel to &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, Seneca is portrayed as an unbearable sycophant. He is shown as a flatterer who converts to Stoicism solely to appease Claudius&#x27;s own ideology. The &quot;Pumpkinification&quot; (&quot;Apocolocyntosis&quot;) to Graves thus becomes an unbearable work of flattery to the loathsome Nero, mocking a man that Seneca groveled to for years. 
* The historical novel &quot;Chariot of the Soul&quot; by Linda Proud features Seneca as tutor of the young Togidubnus, son of King Verica of the Atrebates, during his ten-year stay in Rome.
* The 2023 film &quot;Seneca – On the Creation of Earthquakes&quot; focuses on the final days of Seneca, portrayed by John Malkovich.
* In Simon Scarrow&#x27;s 2020 novel &#x27;The Emperor&#x27;s Exile&#x27;, the 19th book in the Eagles of Rome series, Seneca sends the hero of the books, Prefect Cato, to Sardinia to escort Nero&#x27;s mistress into exile and to defeat the brigands who terrorise the island. Throughout the series of books we learn that the man who whispers in the Emperor&#x27;s ear is the real power behind the throne but that power often proves fatal to the bearer.

<text>Jeremiah (also known as &quot;The Survivors&quot; in some English translations) is a Belgian science fiction comic book series by Hermann Huppen. &quot;Jeremiah&quot; was created in 1979 for the German magazine &quot;Zack&quot;, and had a premiere in Sarajevo based &quot;Strip art&quot; magazine, since the editor of this magazine, Ervin Rustemagic, was also Hermann&#x27;s manager. It has also been serialized in the French-language &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; and &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, as well as the Serbian magazines &quot;Stripoteka&quot; and &quot;Politikin Zabavnik&quot;. Currently, there are 40 volumes and one &quot;Special Edition&quot; in French and Dutch.

==Plot==
Racial wars have torn the U.S. apart, resulting in a post-apocalyptic world. Many small pockets of civilization still exist; from isolated super high-tech fortresses, hidden research labs, or racial groups in walled-in cities — all fighting each other among the more regular population which in many ways resembles the &quot;old west&quot;.

Jeremiah and his friend Kurdy travel the country, taking odd jobs and getting mixed up in various affairs. Jeremiah, being the more noble of the two, often sticks his neck out to help others, while Kurdy is a more wily, opportunistic scoundrel.

Despite its setting, &quot;Jeremiah&quot;&#x27;s underlying motif is of hope and the survival of mankind. The storylines carry little from album to album, meaning they can be read individually.

==Reception==
&quot;Jeremiah&quot; has been translated into 26 languages, and has a large fan base in Europe. Tome #25, &quot;Et si un jour la Terre&quot;, was nominated for the 2005 Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize Awarded by the Audience.

Various attempts to introduce the series to the American market have had middling results, mostly due to the different tastes of the American and European comic book public. The current holder of the English language copyrights is Strip Art Features (SAF). After failing to reach American audiences in the 1980s and 1990s with such publishers as Fantagraphics, Catalan Communications, and Malibu Comics; &quot;Jeremiah&quot; (and SAF) found success with Dark Horse beginning in the 2000s. In March 2012, Dark Horse Comics began another English language reprint series in collaboration with SAF; three volumes of the &quot;Jeremiah Omnibus&quot;, collecting tomes 1 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9 respectively, have been released as of October 2017. In May 2019, SAF released digital editions of volumes 1 to 6, and later of volumes 7 to 9 in July 2020.

== List of titles ==
Following are the &quot;Jeremiah&quot; comic albums as named in French, with publication dates.
=== English language &quot;Jeremiah&quot; comics ===
==Television series==

An American television series, &quot;Jeremiah&quot;, was produced from 2002–2004. Developed by &quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator J. Michael Straczynski and executive produced by Straczynski and Sam Egan, the series is loosely based on the &quot;Jeremiah&quot; comics series. Aside from the names of the two main characters, the general personality of the protagonist, and the post-apocalyptic setting, there are no similarities between the comics and the series.

<text>Jeremiah is a post-apocalyptic action drama television series starring Luke Perry and Malcolm-Jamal Warner that ran on the Showtime network from 2002 to 2004. The series takes place in a future wherein the adult population has been wiped out by a deadly virus.

The series ended production in 2003, after the management of Showtime decided they were no longer interested in producing science fiction programming. Had the series continued, it would have run under a different showrunner than J. Michael Straczynski, who decided to leave following the completion of the production of the second season due to creative differences between him and MGM Television.

Episodes for the final half of the second season did not begin airing in the United States until September 3, 2004.

==Plot==
In an alternate 2021, the eponymous Jeremiah is a loner who has spent 15 years searching the United States for a place called &quot;Valhalla Sector&quot;. His father, a viral researcher, named Valhalla Sector as a possible refuge shortly before disappearing into the chaos of &quot;The Big Death&quot;, a 2006 plague that killed nearly everyone over the age of thirteen. A stop in the Colorado trading town of Clarefield results in Jeremiah teaming up with another lone traveller named Kurdy, before being imprisoned by the town&#x27;s warlord with a man named Simon. Simon wants to recruit Jeremiah for a vague and mysterious organization. With Kurdy&#x27;s help, Jeremiah and Simon escape, but Simon is fatally wounded in the process.

Following the instructions given to them by the dying Simon, Jeremiah and Kurdy take Simon&#x27;s truck back to &quot;Thunder Mountain&quot;, the remains of the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, where they discover a well-organized and well-equipped group led by the former child prodigy Markus Alexander. Markus chooses to employ Jeremiah and Kurdy as a recon team to replace Simon and his partner, sending the two men back outside to gather information in preparation for the time when the organization will need to start rebuilding the world.

Over the course of the first season, the group encounters threats originating from Valhalla Sector, which they discover to be a sealed and heavily armed bunker complex in Pennsylvania (the ruins of Raven Rock Mountain Complex), used to house the remainder of the US government and military leadership during The Big Death. The survivors there plan to rebuild the world in an authoritarian mold using military might and weaponizing The Big Death virus itself to wipe out non-compliant populations. The second half of Season 1 primarily deals with the efforts of Jeremiah and Thunder Mountain to stop Valhalla Sector.

After the final defeat of Valhalla Sector in the opening episodes of Season 2, a new threat emerges in the form of a crusading army from the East, led by a mysterious prophetic figure known as Daniel. Season 2 deals with the impending conflict between the unifying survivor communities under Thunder Mountain, and the advancing Army of Daniel.

Although a third season was considered, series creator J. Michael Straczynski made it clear that if the show ran a further season he would have nothing to do with it. The show concluded with the end of the second season resolving most plot threads.

==Cast==
Most of the characters are survivors of the virus who are now in their late twenties or younger.
==Production==
===Development===
Developed by &quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator J. Michael Straczynski and executive produced by Straczynski and Sam Egan in the first season, and Straczynski and Grant Rosenberg in the second, the series is loosely based on Belgian writer Hermann Huppen&#x27;s comic book series, &quot;Jeremiah&quot;, which began in 1979. Aside from the names of the two main characters, the general personality of the protagonist, and the post-apocalyptic setting, there are no similarities between the comics and the series. Having previously published black and white English translations of the first three volumes under the Adventure Comics imprint of Malibu in 1991, Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, the CEO of Platinum Studios (a company that specializes in comics-to-film properties translations), acquired the media rights to the books and developed a television series. Executive Producer J. Michael Straczynski stated it was a &quot;road show&quot; with Jeremiah and Kurdy traveling around the country in a military Jeep.

Shooting began in Vancouver, British Columbia in the fall of 2001. Actors Luke Perry, from &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, and Malcolm Jamal-Warner, from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, were cast in the leads.

===Filming===
The series was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

===Locations===
===Cancellation===
Straczynski had prepared a five-year series. But a change in personnel in Showtime&#x27;s administration caused the network to decide to stop producing science fiction programming and unofficially cancel Jeremiah before the second season had its debut in November 2003. Fans realized the possibility of cancellation when Showtime announced the airing of only the first seven out of fifteen episodes of the second season, and organized a campaign to write and phone executives at Showtime, MGM and Platinum Studios to convince them to show the remaining eight and continue with a third season. Ultimately, the network began airing the remaining of the second season starting on September 3, 2004 - after a ten-month break since the last aired episode - but despite continuously rising ratings did not proceed with the renewal of the show.

Before season 2 premiered, Straczynski vowed to never work with the then-current administration of MGM Television after experiencing major creative differences with them, and had there been a third season it would have to run under some new showrunner. Everyone on cast and crew, including Grant Rosenberg, the second season&#x27;s co-executive producer, were willing to have continued.

==Episodes==

==Home media==
In January 2004, MGM Home Entertainment released season 1 of &quot;Jeremiah&quot; on DVD. Season 2 was released on DVD as a &quot;burn on demand&quot; from Amazon (available to US and Canadian addresses only) in March 2010. The series episodes are also available as digital purchases on Amazon, Hulu and iTunes (season 2 only).

==In other media==
===RPGs===
After having been designed by Morrigan Press, Mongoose Publishing published &quot;&quot; in 2005.

<text>Anne Lamott (born April 10, 1954) is an American novelist and nonfiction writer.

She is also a progressive political activist, public speaker, and writing teacher. Lamott is based in Marin County, California. Her nonfiction works are largely autobiographical. Lamott&#x27;s writings, marked by their self-deprecating humor and openness, cover such subjects as alcoholism, single-motherhood, depression, and Christianity.

==Early life and education==
Lamott was born in San Francisco, and is a graduate of Drew School. She was a student at Goucher College for two years where she wrote for the newspaper. Her father, Kenneth Lamott, was also a writer. Her first published novel &quot;Hard Laughter&quot; was written for him after his diagnosis of brain cancer. She has one son, Sam, who was born in August 1989 and a grandson, Jax, born in July 2009.

==Career==
Lamott&#x27;s life was documented in Freida Lee Mock&#x27;s 1999 documentary &quot;Bird by Bird with Annie: A Film Portrait of Writer Anne Lamott&quot;. Because of the documentary and her following on Facebook and other online networks, she is often called the &quot;People&#x27;s Author&quot;.

Lamott has described why she writes: I try to write the books I would love to come upon, that are honest, concerned with real lives, human hearts, spiritual transformation, families, secrets, wonder, craziness—and that can make me laugh. When I am reading a book like this, I feel rich and profoundly relieved to be in the presence of someone who will share the truth with me, and throw the lights on a little, and I try to write these kinds of books. Books, for me, are medicine. 

Lamott was featured on the second episode of the first season of the show &quot;The Midnight Gospel&quot;.

===Awards and honors===
Lamott was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1985. She was inducted into the California Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Personal life==
On April 13, 2019, Lamott married Neal Allen, 63, a former vice president for marketing at the McKesson Corporation in San Francisco. The couple met in August 2016. He is a twice-divorced father of four, who left his job at McKesson to devote himself to writing.

<text>Majorian (; 7 August 461) was Western Roman emperor from 457 to 461. A prominent commander in the Western military, Majorian deposed Avitus in 457 with the aid of his ally Ricimer at the Battle of Placentia. Possessing little more than Italy and Dalmatia, as well as some territory in Hispania and northern Gaul, Majorian campaigned rigorously for three years against the Empire&#x27;s enemies. In 461, he was murdered at Dertona in a conspiracy, and his successors until the fall of the Empire in 476 were puppets either of barbarian generals or the Eastern Roman court.

After defeating a Vandal attack on Italy in 457, Majorian intercepted the Visigoths in the Battle of Arelate, defeating them and saving the city. Securing Septimania, he reduced the Goths to federate status, returning Hispania to the empire. Meanwhile, Marcellinus was convinced to recognise Majorian, reconquering Sicily in the emperor&#x27;s name. Majorian then attacked the Burgundians, reconquering Lugdunum and expelling them from the Rhône valley. Marching into Gaul, he reintegrated the Gallo-Romans and appointed Aegidius commander of the region, whilst Nepotianus invaded the Kingdom of the Suebi and reconquered Scalabis. In 460, Majorian entered Hispania and readied a fleet for an invasion of Africa. However, the Vandals bribed traitors into defection and destroyed the fleet in the Battle of Cartagena, forcing Majorian to return to Italy.

During his reign, Majorian instituted reforms to reduce corruption, rebuild the state&#x27;s institutions and preserve ancient monuments. This led to an antagonistic relationship with the Roman Senate, which was exploited by Ricimer to behead Majorian upon his arrival in Italy in 461. The 6th-century writer Procopius asserted that Majorian &quot;surpassed in every virtue all who have ever been emperors of the Romans&quot;, whilst Sidonius Apollinaris, a contemporary of the emperor, stated, &quot;That he was gentle to his subjects; that he was terrible to his enemies; and that he excelled in every virtue, all his predecessors who had reigned over the Romans.&quot;

==Early life==
The life of Majorian and his reign are better known than those of the other Western Emperors of the same period. The most important sources are the chronicles that cover the second half of the 5th century—those of Hydatius and Marcellinus Comes, as well as the fragments of Priscus and John of Antioch.

Besides these sources, which are useful also for the biographies of the other emperors, some peculiar sources are available that make Majorian&#x27;s life known in some detail, both before and after his rise to the throne. The Gallo-Roman aristocrat and poet Sidonius Apollinaris was an acquaintance of the Emperor and composed a panegyric that is the major source for Majorian&#x27;s life up to 459. As regards his policy, twelve of his laws have been preserved: the so-called &quot;&quot; were included in the Breviary of Alaric, compiled for Alaric II in 506, which helps to understand the problems that pressed Majorian&#x27;s government.

Majorian was probably born after 420, as in 458 he was described as a (&#x27;young man&#x27;). He belonged to the military aristocracy of the Roman Empire. His grandfather of the same name reached the rank of under Emperor Theodosius I and, as commander-in-chief of the Illyrian army, was present at his coronation at Sirmium in 379. The &#x27;s daughter then married an officer, probably called Domninus, who administered the finances of Aetius, the most powerful general of the West. The couple gave the name &quot;Maiorianus&quot; to their child in honour of his influential grandfather, as was the custom for the firstborn son.

It was under the same Aetius that Majorian started his military career. He followed Aetius to Gallia, where he met two officers also under Aetius&#x27;s command who were to play an important role in Majorian&#x27;s life: the Suebic-Visigoth Ricimer and the Gallo-Roman Aegidius. Majorian distinguished himself in the defence of the city of Turonensis (modern Tours) and in a battle near &quot;Vicus Helena&quot; (447 or 448) against the Franks under Chlodio. In the latter, Majorian fought at the head of his cavalry on a bridge, while Aetius controlled the roads leading to the battlefield:


Around 450, the Western Roman Emperor Valentinian III considered the possibility of marrying his daughter Placidia to Majorian. Valentinian had two daughters but no sons, and therefore no heir to the throne. Having Majorian as son-in-law would have strengthened Valentinian in the face of other powerful generals and would have solved the problem of the succession. Furthermore, as Emperor, Majorian could have led the army himself, freed from the dangerous bond with a powerful general, such as Valentinian had been obliged to contract with Aetius.

The intention of this plan was to avoid the possibility that barbarian generals like Huneric or Attila should succeed to Aetius, but clashed with the plans of Aetius himself. The Roman general, in fact, planned to marry his own son Gaudentius to Placidia. He therefore opposed Valentinian&#x27;s plan, and put an end to Majorian&#x27;s military career, expelling him from his staff and sending him to his country estate. According to the poet Sidonius Apollinaris, the cause of the fall of Majorian was the jealousy of Aetius&#x27;s wife, who feared that Majorian could overshadow Aetius&#x27;s prestige.

It was only in 454 that Majorian was able to return to public life. In that year, Valentinian III killed Aetius with his own hands. Fearing that Aetius&#x27;s troops might revolt, he called Majorian back to office to quell any dissent. In the following year, Valentinian III was killed by two former officers of Aetius&#x27;s staff. There was then a fight for the succession, as no heir existed. Majorian played the role of the candidate for the throne of Licinia Eudoxia, Valentinian&#x27;s widow, and of Ricimer, who reserved for himself a role similar to Aetius&#x27;s.

In the end, the new emperor was Petronius Maximus, a senator involved in Valentinian&#x27;s murder, who outmanoeuvred the other candidates. To strengthen his position, he obliged Licinia to marry him and promoted Majorian to the rank of (commander-in-chief of the imperial guard).

==Rise to the throne==
===The revolt against Avitus===
Petronius ruled only for a few weeks, as he was killed during the Vandal sack of Rome (May 455). He was succeeded, not by Majorian, but by the Gallic-Roman noble Avitus, who had the support of the Visigoths. Both Majorian, &quot;comes domesticorum&quot;, and Ricimer, &quot;comes rei militaris&quot; of Italy, initially supported Avitus, but when the Emperor lost the loyalty of the Italian aristocracy, the two generals revolted against him. First Majorian and Ricimer killed Remistus, the &quot;magister militum&quot; entrusted by Avitus with the defence of the capital, Ravenna. Then Ricimer defeated Avitus&#x27; troops near Placentia, taking the Emperor himself prisoner, and obliging him to abdicate. Finally, Majorian caused Avitus&#x27; death, possibly starving him, in early 457.

===Emperor of the West===
Avitus was dead and the Western throne without an emperor. It was thus for the Eastern Roman Emperor to choose the successor, but Marcian could do nothing, as he died on 27 January 457. His successor on the Eastern throne was the general Leo I, who instead decided to rule alone. On 28 February, Majorian became &quot;magister militum&quot;, while Ricimer became &quot;patricius&quot; and &quot;magister militum&quot;. This was more likely an act of usurpation rather than an appointment made by Leo.

While the situation was in a precarious equilibrium, a troop of 900 Alemanni invaded Italy. They entered from Raetia and penetrated Italian territory down to Lake Maggiore. There they were intercepted and defeated in the Battle of Campi Cannini by the troops of &quot;comes&quot; Burco, sent by Majorian to stop them:

This victory was celebrated as Majorian&#x27;s own, and the &quot;magister militum&quot; was acclaimed Emperor by the army (perhaps on 1 April), six miles outside Ravenna, at a place called &quot;ad Columellas&quot;, &quot;at the Little Columns&quot;.

In his panegyric to Majorian, the poet Sidonius Apollinaris tells that Majorian initially refused the election:
Majorian was formally declared emperor on 28 December. Majorian assumed the consulate for the year 458; it was customary that a new Emperor took this magistracy on the first year started as Emperor. He apparently never obtained recognition from the eastern court, as almost all contemporary eastern sources refer to Leo I as sole consul.

==Foreign affairs==
===Defence of Italy===
In summer 457, a group of Vandals, led by the brother-in-law of Genseric, landed in Campania, at the mouth of the Liri river, and started devastating and sacking the region. Majorian personally led the Roman army to a victory over the invaders near Sinuessa and followed the defeated Vandals, loaded with their booty, as far as their own ships, killing many of them including their commander.

After this event, Majorian understood that he had to take the initiative if he wanted to defend the heart of his Empire, the only territory he actually controlled. So he decided to strengthen its defences. First, he issued a law, the &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 8 known as &quot;De reddito iure armorum&quot; (&quot;On the Return of the Right to Bear Arms&quot;), concerning the personal right to bear arms; in 440, Valentinian III had already promulgated a law with the same name, &quot;Novella Valentiniani&quot; 9, after another attack of the Vandals. It is probably to this time that another law is to be dated, the &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 12 known as &quot;De aurigis et seditiosis&quot; (&quot;Concerning Charioteers and Seditious Persons&quot;), to quell the disorders that sprang up during the chariot races. Both these laws are now lost.

He then strengthened the army, recruiting a large number of barbarian mercenaries, including Gepids, Ostrogoths, Rugii, Burgundians, Huns, Bastarnae, Suebi, Scythians and Alans. Finally, he rebuilt two fleets, probably those of Miseno and Ravenna, since the Vandals had a strong navy:
===Reconquest of Gaul===
After consolidating his position in Italy, Majorian concentrated on the recovery of Gaul. When news of the deposition of the Gallo-Roman emperor Avitus arrived in Gaul, the province refused to recognize Majorian as his successor. An important clue to this is an inscription found in Lugdunum (modern Lyons) and dating to 458; according to Roman custom, the inscriptions were dated by writing the names of the consuls in office, who that year were supposed to be Leo I and Majorian. This inscription, instead, records only the name of Eastern Emperor Leo I, showing that Majorian was not recognized at the time as the lawful Western Emperor.

Another clue is the fact that, at the death of Avitus, the citizens of Lugdunum sent an envoy to Leo, and not to Majorian, to ask for a reduction of taxation. Finally, there is a record of a failed usurpation in Gaul, around this time.

In late 458, Majorian entered Gaul, with an army strengthened by barbarian units. The Emperor personally led the army, leaving Ricimer in Italy and choosing Aegidius and the &quot;magister militum Nepotianus&quot; as collaborators. The imperial army defeated the Visigoths under king Theodoric II at the Battle of Arelate, forcing the Visigoths to abandon Septimania and withdraw west to Aquitania. The Roman victory was decisive: under the new treaty the Visigoths had to relinquish their vast conquests in Hispania and return to federate status. Majorian chose his trusted general Aegidius as the new &quot;magister militum per Gallias&quot; (military commander of Gaul) and sent an envoy to Hispania, to report the victory over the Visigoths and the new treaty with Theodoric II.

With the help of his new &quot;foederati&quot;, Majorian entered the Rhone Valley, conquering its populations &quot;some by arms and some by diplomacy&quot;. He defeated the Burgundians and besieged and conquered the city of Lugdunum: the rebel city was heavily fined, while the Bagaudae were forced to join the Empire. Despite the fact that the Gallo-Roman aristocracy had sided with Avitus, Majorian wanted a reconciliation, not a punishment. With the intercession of Majorian&#x27;s &quot;magister epistolarum&quot; Petrus, Sidonius Apollinaris, the son-in-law of Avitus, was allowed to deliver a panegyric in honour of the Emperor (early January 459), receiving in reward the appointment to the rank of &quot;comes spectabilis&quot;. Much more effective was, however, the granting of the tax remission that the citizens of Lugdunum had requested from Leo I.

===Campaign in Hispania===

In the wake of the Vandal sack of Rome (455), the Visigoths had conquered Hispania, formally in the name of the new Western Emperor Avitus, actually controlling the territory themselves. Majorian planned to reconquer Hispania and use it as the base for the conquest of Africa. This rich province of the Western Empire, which provided for the very important grain supply to the city of Rome, was in fact under Vandal control.

According to the historian Procopius, Majorian, &quot;who surpassed in every virtue all who ever were emperors of the Romans&quot;, wanted to know personally the military readiness of the Vandals and how the local populations would react to the Roman invasion. He dyed black his fair hair, for which he was famous, and went to Genseric claiming to be an envoy of the Western Emperor. Genseric tried to impress the enemy ambassador by showing him the arms collected in the warehouses and sent him back. This story is probably only a legend of Italian folklore, but it is a clue to the care with which the expedition was prepared. Majorian collected information on the enemy and gathered a fleet of three hundred ships to support the army in the reconquest of Hispania and in the invasion of Africa.

It was probably during the preparation of this operation that Majorian sent the &quot;comes&quot; and &quot;patricius Occidentis&quot; Marcellinus to Sicily with an army of Huns, to take the island back from the Vandals. Marcellinus was the &quot;comes rei militaris&quot; (governor) of Illyricum, but he had become practically independent since the death of Aetius, not recognizing the imperial authority. Majorian convinced him to accept him as Emperor and even to collaborate with his troops in the military recovery of the Empire.

The campaign started with an operation against the Suebi in North-Western Hispania, lasting the whole of 459, led by the &quot;magister militiae&quot; Nepotianus and the Gothic &quot;comes&quot; Sunieric. Majorian gathered the main part of the army in Liguria, then entered Aquitaine and &quot;Novempopulania&quot; coming from Theodoric&#x27;s court in Toulouse (May 460). Genseric, fearing the Roman invasion, tried to negotiate a peace with Majorian, who rejected the proposal, since the economic investment he had done to prepare the campaign had been enormous. The Vandal king then decided to devastate Mauretania and Numidia, his own territory, by poisoning the water sources and burning the fields, because he thought that the Roman army would land there, and also ordered his navy to prepare incursions in the waters near the probable invasion area.

In the meantime, Majorian was conquering Hispania. While Nepotianus and Sunieric defeated the Suebi at &quot;Lucus Augusti&quot; (modern Lugo) and conquered &quot;Scallabis&quot; in Lusitania (modern Santarém, Portugal), the Emperor passed through &quot;Caesaraugusta&quot; (Saragossa), where he performed a formal imperial &quot;adventus&quot;. Finally he reached Carthaginiensis, where his fleet, docked at &quot;Portus Illicitanus&quot; (near Elche), was destroyed by traitors paid by the Vandals:
In autumn 460 Majorian, deprived of the fleet that was necessary for the invasion, cancelled the attack on the Vandals and received the ambassadors of Gaiseric, with whom he agreed to conclude peace, which probably included the recognition of the &quot;de facto&quot; occupation of Mauretania by the Vandals. He disbanded his costly troops, and moved to Arelate to spend the winter, while he expected to be welcome with dissent in Italy.

==Domestic policy==
Majorian&#x27;s domestic policy is known thanks to some of the laws he issued, the so-called &quot;Novellae Maioriani&quot;, that were included in a collection of Roman law called the Breviary of Alaric, requested from some Gallo-Roman jurists in 506 by the Visigothic king Alaric II .

The preserved laws are:
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 1, &quot;De ortu imperii domini Majoriani Augusti&quot;, &quot;The Beginning of the Reign of Our Lord Majorian Augustus&quot;, opening speech of his reign, addressed to the Roman Senate (given in Ravenna, on 11 January 458);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 2, &quot;De indulgentiis reliquorum&quot;, &quot;On the Remission of Past-Due Accounts&quot; (given in Ravenna, on 11 March 458, to Basilius, Praetorian prefect of Italy);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 3, &quot;De defensoribus civitatum&quot;, &quot;The Defenders of the Municipalities&quot;, on the office of &quot;defensor civitatum&quot; (given in Ravenna, on 8 May 458, also in the name of Leo I);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 4, &quot;De aedificiis pubblicis&quot;, &quot;Public Buildings&quot;, on the preservation of the monuments of Rome (given in Ravenna, on 11 July 458, to Aemilianus, &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; of Rome, also in the name of Leo I);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 5, &quot;De bonis caducis sive proscriptorum&quot;, &quot;On Abandoned Property and That of Proscribed Persons&quot; (given in Ravenna, on 4 September 458, to Ennodius, &quot;comes privatae largitionis&quot;, also in the name of Leo I);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 6, &quot;De sanctimonialibus vel viduis et de successionibus earum&quot;, &quot;Holy Maidens, Widows, and Their Succession&quot; (given in Ravenna, on 26 October 458, to Basilius, Praetorian prefect of Italy, also in the name of Leo I);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 7, &quot;De curialibus et de agnatione vel distractione praediorum et de ceteris negotiis&quot;, &quot;Curiales, Their Children and The Sale of Their Landed Estates&quot; (given in Ravenna, on 6 November 458, to Basilius, Praetorian prefect of Italy, also in the name of Leo I);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 8, &quot;De reddito iure armorum&quot;, &quot;On the Return of the Right to Bear Arms&quot;, whose text is lost;
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 9, &quot;De adulteriis&quot;, &quot;Adultery&quot;, confirming that the adulterers are to be put to death (given in Arelate, on 17 April 459, to Rogatianus, governor of Suburbicarian Tuscany, also in the name of Leo I);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 10, about the right of the Roman senators and of the Church to keep the goods received in a will, whose text is lost;
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 11, &quot;De episcopali iudicio et ne quis invitus clericus ordinetur vel de ceteris negotiis&quot;, &quot;Episcopal Courts; No Person Shall Be Ordained A Cleric Against His Will; Various Matters&quot;, (given in Arelate, on 28 March 460, to Ricimer, also in the name of Leo I);
* &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 12, &quot;De aurigis et seditiosis&quot;, &quot;Charioteers and Seditious Persons&quot;, whose text is lost.

===Fiscal policy and coinage===
Majorian understood that he could reign effectively only with the support of the senatorial aristocracy, whom he wanted to return to its pristine political prominence. At the same time, he planned to reduce the abuses perpetrated by the senators, many of whom cultivated their local interests disregarding the imperial policies, even refusing to pay taxes and keeping for themselves the taxes they had exacted. This fiscal evasion had a cascade effect that affected the small landowners, the citizens and the local civil magistrates.

For example, the decurions had to personally compensate the imperial treasury for all taxes not exacted. Sometimes, oppressed by the debts accumulated in this way, the decurions abandoned their status, a problem which was previously addressed by Emperor Julian (361–363). Majorian also cancelled tax arrears, knowing that fiscal policy could not be effective if taxpayers had to pay large accumulated arrears.

On 11 March 458, Majorian issued a law entitled &quot;De indulgentiis reliquorum&quot;, &quot;On the Remission of Past-Due Accounts&quot; (&quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 2). This law remitted all the tax arrears of the landowners. This same law explicitly prohibited public administrators, who had a record of keeping the collected money for themselves, from collecting taxes. This task was to be reserved to the governors alone. Another law issued to reorganise the tax system was issued on 4 September of the same year, and was entitled &quot;De bonis caducis sive proscriptorum&quot;, &quot;On Abandoned Property and That of Proscribed Persons&quot; (&quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 5): the &quot;comes privatae largitionis&quot; Ennodius was to admonish the provincial judges against defrauding the imperial treasure by keeping for themselves a part of the money collected.
The Emperor was also interested in repairing the backbone of the imperial administration. On 8 May 458, Majorian issued a law entitled &quot;De defensoribus civitatum&quot;, &quot;The Defenders of the Municipalities&quot; (&quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 3), to re-establish the office of the &quot;defensor civitatis&quot;. This city magistrate represented the interests of the citizens in trials against the public administration, particularly in fiscal matters; this magistracy was still in existence, but actually ineffective, since it was often held by the same officials who cheated the population.

Another law was issued on 6 November to strengthen the magistracy of the decurions. &quot;De curialibus et de agnatione vel distractione praediorum et de ceteris negotiis&quot;, &quot;Decurions, Their Children and The Sale of Their Landed Estates&quot; (&quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 7), was issued to forgive past abuses perpetrated by the decurions. This forbade them from leaving their status (going into hiding or marrying slave or tenant farmers) or alienating their own properties.

Majorian minted coins in gold, silver and bronze. Gold coinage was minted in great quantities. On these coins the Emperor is depicted, with few exceptions, with a combat helmet, a spear, a shield, and a chi-rho, looking towards the right; this typology was derived from a rare type minted in Ravenna for Honorius and used in great quantities only by Majorian, it was dropped by his successors. The first series of solidi were probably minted in Ravenna, and bear on the obverse the joint portrait of Majorian and Leo I, thus celebrating the mutual recognition of the two Roman emperors. The mints of Ravenna and Milan issued both solidi and tremisses from the beginning of Majorian&#x27;s reign.

No series of semisses are attested for these two mints, probably because the semisses were typically minted by the mint of Rome and this mint was not active under Majorian, who never visited the ancient capital of his Empire during his four years of rule. The minting of solidi is attested for the mint of Arelate in 458, a fact compatible with the presence of Majorian in Gaul in that year. This mint was again active in 460, when the Emperor returned from his campaign in Hispania. The Visigoths minted some reproductions of his solidi, modelled after the issues of the Arelate mint: as Arelate issued only solidi, the Visigoths used those designs also for the tremissis.

Silver coinage was issued almost exclusively by the Gallic mints; it has been suggested that these series were not issued by Majorian, but by Aegidius after the Emperor&#x27;s death, to mark the fact that he did not recognize his successor, Libius Severus. Majorian also produced great quantities of nummi of great weight, mostly minted at Ravenna and Milan, and some contorniates, mostly in Rome, but probably also in Ravenna.

===Natalist policies===
The diffusion of Christianity in the Empire caused some social changes within the aristocratic families. In several wealthy families, daughters were obliged to take religious vows and never marry, so that the family wealth would not be dispersed in dowries. Majorian thought that this behaviour was harmful to the State, because it reduced the number of Roman children, and because it caused the girls to start illicit affairs. On 26 October 458, the Emperor addressed a law, the &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 6, to the Praetorian prefect of Italy, Caecina Decius Basilius.

This law, titled &quot;De sanctimonialibus vel viduis et de successionibus earum&quot; (&quot;Holy Maidens, Widows, and Their Succession&quot;), imposed a minimum age of 40 for taking religious vows, considering that at this age the sexual drives of the initiated would be dormant. The law also granted women who had been forced to take religious vows, and were subsequently disinherited, the same rights on the legacy of parents as their brothers and sisters.

In order to solve this same problem of the decline of the Roman population, in particular compared with the growth of the barbarians allocated within the imperial boundaries, Majorian addressed the problem of young women widowed and without children who never remarried because of the influence of the clergy, to whom they destined their goods in their will. The young widows were prohibited from taking religious vows.

By the same measure, departing in this from the policy of the Eastern Empire, Majorian insisted that a marriage without dowry and pre-wedding exchange of gifts (first from the bride&#x27;s family to the groom, then in the opposite direction) was invalid; he simultaneously ended the practice of requesting pre-wedding gifts of a value considerably higher than the dowry.

===Relationship with the senatorial aristocracy===
When Majorian took power by deposing Avitus, the province of Gaul, where Avitus&#x27; power was based, did not recognize the new Emperor. When Majorian re-conquered the province, he chose to forgive this rebellion. The reason was that Majorian understood that one of the mistakes of his predecessor was to promote and trust only the senatorial aristocracy of Gaul, the region he came from, favouring it over the senatorial aristocracy of Italy.

Majorian, instead, decided to gain the favour of the wealthy and noble families of the recovered province by involving them in the imperial administration, together with the Italian aristocracy that had supported him since the beginning. For evidence of this policy, one can point to the origins of the high civil servants of his administration, in particular of the consuls, whom the Emperor appointed jointly with his Eastern colleague.

In the first year (458) Majorian reserved the honour for himself, as was usual for the &quot;augusti&quot;, while in the second year he appointed his former colleague and powerful &quot;magister militum&quot;, Ricimer. Then, for the year 460, he choose the Gallic senator Magnus, and for the next year the Italian senator Severinus. Magnus had been appointed Praetorian prefect of Gaul in 458, while the Praetorian prefect of Italy was Caecina Decius Basilius, who was the patron of the Gallic senator (and poet) Sidonius Apollinaris, while the &quot;comes privatae largitionis&quot;, Ennodius, was related to a family with interests in Arelate.

Majorian also showed great respect towards the Roman senate, as suggested by the message he addressed to it on the eve of his coronation: he promised the senators he would not take into account the accusations of informers, which were much feared as they might be used by the Emperor to cause the fall of influential figures. He followed through on his promises, as told by Sidonius Apollinaris, who had been anonymously accused of the authorship of a pamphlet against some influential figures: during a dinner together, Majorian defused the risky situation with a witticism.

===Conservation of the monuments of Rome===

From the beginning of the 4th century, the monuments of Rome, and more generally all buildings of some value that were in a state of neglect for various reasons, were increasingly used as quarries for valuable building materials. This practice, in fact, was cheaper and more convenient than import from remote locations, which was sometimes rendered difficult or impossible by the control of the sea by the Vandals. Roman officials conceded upon petition the use for construction of marble, stone and brick recovered from demolition of ancient monuments:

To cope with this phenomenon, Majorian promulgated a law, &quot;Novella Maioriani&quot; 4, &quot;De aedificiis pubblicis&quot; (&quot;Public Buildings&quot;), in Ravenna on 11 July 459, addressed to Aemilianus, &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; of Rome. The punishment for judges who had allowed the destruction of ancient public buildings was 50 pounds of gold, while their subordinates were whipped and had both hands amputated. Those who had removed materials from public buildings were to return them. The Senate had the power to decide whether there were extreme conditions that justified the demolition of an old building and, if it decided for the demolition, the Emperor still had the right to order that the resulting materials should be used to decorate other public buildings.

==Fall and death==

Just as Avitus&#x27;s fate had been decided by the betrayal by Ricimer and Majorian and by the dismissal of his German guard, so the fate of Majorian himself was decided by the disbandment of his army and a plot organized by Ricimer. In fact, while the Emperor was busy away from Italy, the barbarian &quot;patricius et magister militum&quot; had gathered around himself the aristocratic opposition to his former comrade with whom, just a few years earlier, he had cultivated dreams of power. Majorian&#x27;s legislation had shown that he intended to intervene decisively on issues that plagued the empire, even if they countered the interests of influential aristocrats.

After spending the winter and the spring after the defeat in the Vandal campaign at Arelate, Majorian left during summer with a small guard (probably &quot;domestici&quot;), probably with the intention to reach Rome. He did not try to cross the Alps, as he had done in 458, but moved from Arelate along the via Aurelia, in Southern Gallia and Liguria, only to change direction and move towards the north: he had probably received news that Ricimer was coming to meet him, and wanted to reach Dertona and from there take the via Aemilia towards Ravenna. However Ricimer intercepted him in Dertona (not far from Piacenza, where Avitus had been killed) on 2 August, and had him arrested and deposed.

The Emperor was deprived of his dress and diadem, beaten and tortured. After five days, on 7 August, Majorian was beheaded near the river Iria. The city of Tortona now hosts, in the church of St. Matthew, a building traditionally identified as the &quot;mausoleum of Majorian&quot;; however, Ennodius complains that Majorian did not receive an appropriate burial.

Ricimer spread the news that Majorian had died of natural causes, then waited for three months before placing on the imperial throne a person he believed he could manipulate. He finally chose Libius Severus, a senator of no political distinction, probably selected to please the Italian senatorial aristocracy. The new emperor was not recognized by the Eastern Emperor Leo I, nor by any of the generals who had served under Majorian: not by Aegidius in Gaul, not by Marcellinus in Sicily and Illyria, and not by Nepotianus in Hispania.

==Legacy==
According to historian Edward Gibbon, Majorian &quot;presents the welcome discovery of a great and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate age, to vindicate the honour of the human species&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; likewise calls him &quot;the only man to hold that office [i.e. the imperial throne] in the 5th century who had some claim to greatness.&quot;

<doc id="75159" wikidata="Q12125318" url="?curid=75159" title="K Foundation Burn a Million Quid">
<text>K Foundation Burn a Million Quid was a work of performance art executed and filmed on 23 August 1994 in which the K Foundation, an art duo consisting of Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty, burned £1 million (equivalent to £ million in ) in the back of a disused boathouse on the Ardfin Estate on the Scottish island of Jura. The money represented the bulk of the K Foundation&#x27;s funds that had been previously earned by Drummond and Cauty as the KLF.

The event was recorded on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. On the one year anniversary of the burning, 23 August 1995, the film was released as &quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot; and was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging audiences in debates about the burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning for a period of 23 years. 

Drummond discreetly spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted that he regretted burning the money. The self-imposed moratorium officially ended on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning, when Cauty and Drummond hosted a debate asking &quot;Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?&quot; during their &quot;Welcome to the Dark Ages&quot; event.

Collaborator Chris Brook edited and compiled a book, &quot;K Foundation Burn A Million Quid&quot;, which was published by Ellipsis Books in 1997. It compiles stills from the film, accounts of events and viewer reactions, and an image of the brick that was manufactured from the fire&#x27;s ashes. A film consisting of a static three-minute shot of the brick, &quot;This Brick&quot;, was shown at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty&#x27;s performance as 2K in the same year.

==Background==
As the KLF, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were the biggest-selling singles act in the world for 1991. They had also enjoyed considerable success with their album &quot;The White Room&quot; and a number one hit single – &quot;Doctorin&#x27; the Tardis&quot; – as The Timelords. In February 1992, The KLF staged an incendiary performance at the BRIT Awards, and retired from the music industry shortly thereafter in typically enigmatic fashion.

By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian &quot;Big Issue&quot; writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the royalties they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds: 

Initially The KLF&#x27;s earnings were to be distributed by way of a fund for struggling artists managed by the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty&#x27;s new post-KLF art project, but, said Drummond, &quot;We realised that struggling artists are meant to struggle, that&#x27;s the whole point.&quot; Instead the duo decided to create art &quot;with&quot; the money. &quot;Nailed to the Wall&quot; was the first piece of art produced by the Foundation, and the major piece in their planned art exhibition, &quot;Money: A Major Body of Cash&quot;. Consisting of one million pounds in cash nailed to a pine frame, the piece was presented to the press on 23 November 1993 during the buildup to the Foundation&#x27;s announcement of the &quot;winner&quot; of their &quot;worst artist of the year award&quot;, the K Foundation art award.

==Decision and burning==
During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging &quot;Money: A Major Body of Cash&quot;, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. The Tate, in Liverpool, wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I&#x27;m involved with,&#x27; says Casey. &#x27;I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.&#x27; A curt fax from [...] the gallery curator informed Casey that the K Foundation&#x27;s exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly&quot;, leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. &quot;Jimmy said: &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we just burn it?&#x27; remembers Drummond. &#x27;He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I&#x27;d say: &#x27;No, we can&#x27;t do that, let&#x27;s do this...&#x27; But it seemed the most powerful thing to do.&quot; Cauty: &quot;We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare.&quot;

The journey from deciding to burn the money to deciding &quot;how&quot; to burn the money to actually &quot;burning&quot; the money was a long one. Jim Reid, a freelance journalist and the only independent witness to the burning, reported the various schemes the K Foundation considered. The first was offering &quot;Nailed to the Wall&quot; to the Tate Gallery as the &quot;1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation.&quot; The condition was that the gallery must agree to display the piece for at least 10 years. If they refused, the money would be burnt. A second idea was to hire Bankside Power Station, &quot;the future site of the Tate Gallery extension and an imposing building downstream from the South Bank&quot;, as a bonfire venue. In typical KLF &#x27;guerrilla communication&#x27; style, &quot;posters were to appear on 15 August bearing the legend &#x27;The 1995 K Foundation Bequest to the Nation&#x27;, under which would have been an image of Nailed to the Wall on an easel and two flame-throwers lying on the floor. On 24 August a new poster would go up, exactly the same as the first except that this time the work would be burnt.&quot;
The K Foundation&#x27;s ultimate resolution for their one-million-pound &quot;problem&quot; was rather less showbiz, but dramatic nonetheless, the Foundation having decided that making a public spectacle of the event would lessen its impact. On 22 August, Reid, Drummond, Cauty and Gimpo touched down at Islay Airport in the Inner Hebrides and took a ferry to the island of Jura, previously the scene of a wicker man burning ceremony by The KLF. Early in the morning of 23 August 1994, in an abandoned boathouse on Jura, Drummond and Cauty incinerated the money. The burning was witnessed by Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the act for &quot;The Observer&quot;, and it was filmed on a Hi-8 video camera by collaborator Gimpo. As the burning began Reid said he felt guilt and shock. These feelings, he reported, quickly turned to boredom.

The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. According to Drummond, only about £900,000 of the money was actually burnt, with the remainder flying straight up the chimney. Two days later, according to Reid, Jimmy Cauty destroyed all film and photographic evidence of the burning. Ten months later, Gimpo revealed to them that he had secretly kept a copy.

==Film==
&quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot; starts with a short description of the event, and then consists of Drummond and Cauty throwing £50 notes onto the fire. Burning the entire amount takes around 67 minutes. &quot;NME&quot; wrote: 

In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the &quot;Omnibus&quot; documentary series about The K Foundation entitled &quot;A Foundation Course in Art&quot; (usually mislabelled as &quot;The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot; online). Amongst the footage broadcast were scenes from &quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot;. Thomas Sutcliffe, reviewing the programme in &quot;The Independent&quot;, wrote:

===Screening tour===
The first public screening of &quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot; was on Jura on 23 August 1995 – exactly one year after the burning. &quot;We feel we should face them and answer their questions&quot; said one of the duo. Two weeks later an advert appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, announcing a world tour of the film over the next 12 months at &quot;relevant locations&quot;. The second screening was at In the City music industry convention on 5 September in Manchester. After the film was shown, Drummond and Cauty held a question-and-answer session with the theme &quot;Is It Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll?&quot;. A week later, the pair travelled as guests of alternative radio station B92 to Belgrade, where the post-screening discussion was titled &quot;Is it a crime against humanity?&quot; An unauthorised screening at the BBC Television Centre was curtailed and Drummond and Cauty were escorted from the building.

On the weekend of 3 November 1995, the film was screened at several locations in Glasgow, including at football matches involving Celtic and Rangers; a planned screening at Barlinnie prison was cancelled after the Scottish Prison Service withdrew permission. Glasgow&#x27;s artistic community broadly seemed to welcome the screenings. A further public screening on Glasgow Green on 5 November was announced by various newspapers, but there is no record of the showing having ever occurred. The K Foundation disappeared from Glasgow; they later issued a statement that on 5 November 1995 they had signed a &quot;contract&quot; on the side of a Nissan Bluebird - which had then been pushed over the cliffs at Cape Wrath in northern Scotland - agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years.

Despite the K Foundation&#x27;s reported moratorium, further national screenings of the film organised by Chris Brook took place as planned. At each screening, Drummond and Cauty announced they would not answer questions after the film; instead, they would ask questions of the audience. These screenings were held in Bradford, Hull, Liverpool, Jamaica Street Studios, Cheltenham Ladies College, Eton College, Aberystwyth, Glastonbury Tor, Alan Moore&#x27;s front room and Brick Lane, London.

The Brick Lane screening – on 8 December 1995 – had been previewed in &quot;NME&quot;, and was chaotically busy. It was originally planned for a car park, but freezing conditions and snow forced a rethink and the screening was moved indoors, to the basement of the nearby Seven Stars pub. Hundreds of people crammed in to watch the screening, which was eventually abandoned partway through due to the cramped conditions. The &quot;NME&quot; preview had claimed that after the screening the film would be cut up and individual frames sold off to the public. Gimpo, the owner of the film, had no intention of doing so, but after the screening was nearly overwhelmed by a mob of people wanting to take home a piece of the film.

==End of the moratorium==
Drummond and Cauty ended their self-imposed moratorium on 23 August 2017, 23 years after the burning. &quot;Why Did the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?&quot; was debated during &quot;Welcome to the Dark Ages&quot;, a three-day festival celebrating the launch of their novel &quot;2023: A Trilogy&quot;.

==Burning as a theme==
Ritualistic burnings had already been a recurring aspect of Drummond and Cauty&#x27;s work. In 1987, the duo disposed of copies of their copyright-breaching debut album—The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu&#x27;s &quot;1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)&quot;—by burning them in a Swedish field. This event was pictured on the back sleeve of their second album, &quot;Who Killed The JAMs?&quot;, and celebrated in the song &quot;Burn the Bastards&quot;. During the 1991 summer solstice, they burnt a wicker man on Jura, as chronicled in the KLF movie &quot;The Rites of Mu&quot;.

As the K Foundation, Drummond and Cauty threatened to burn the K Foundation art award prize money (Gimpo was fumbling with matches and lighter fluid when, at the last moment, Rachel Whiteread accepted the prize). In the seventh K Foundation press advert they asked &quot;What would you do with a million pounds? Burn it?&quot;

==Reaction and analysis==
Jim Reid&#x27;s piece appeared in &quot;The Observer&quot; on 25 September 1994. This is &quot;one of the most peculiar stories of the year&quot;, he cautioned readers. &quot;Peculiar because pretty much everyone who comes across this magazine is going to have trouble believing a word of it. Peculiar because every last dot and comma of what is to come is the truth.&quot; &quot;It took about two hours for that cash to go up in flames&quot;, he added. &quot;I looked at it closely, it was real. It came from a bona fide security firm and was not swapped at any time on our journey. More importantly, perhaps, after working with the K Foundation I know they are capable of this.&quot;

The &quot;Daily Express&quot; ran the story on 1 October 1994. They reported that charred £50 notes were being found by islanders, who did not doubt the burning had really taken place. Drummond and Cauty had been seen eating in a hotel bar on Jura before leaving with two suitcases, the newspaper reported.

&quot;The Times&quot; followed with essentially the same story on 4 October 1994, adding that the burning &quot;[had] left many on the island bewildered, incredulous and angry&quot;. £1,500 had been handed in by a local fisherman to Islay police: &quot;Sergeant Lachlan Maclean checked the money with both banks on Islay and with Customs and Excise, who pronounced it genuine. &#x27;I telephoned Mr Drummond in London and told him the money had been found. I asked him if it was his. He said he would get in touch with his partner, Mr Cauty. So far he has not telephoned back.

The media returned to the story in earnest in October and November 1995, previewing and then reviewing &quot;Foundation Course in Art&quot;, and reporting on the K Foundation&#x27;s tour screening &quot;Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid&quot;.

An October 1995 feature quoted Kevin Hull, the BBC documentary maker responsible for the &quot;Omnibus&quot; item, saying he had found &quot;the boys rather depressed, and almost in a state of shock&quot;. &quot;Every day I wake up and I think &#x27;Oh God, I&#x27;ve burnt a million quid and everyone thinks it&#x27;s wrong, Cauty told him.

A piece in &quot;The Times&quot; on 5 November 1995, coinciding with the Glasgow screenings, reported that the K Foundation had no solid reason for burning the money or view of what, if anything, the act represented, but concluded &quot;The K Foundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly provoked thousands to question and analyse the power of money and the responsibilities of those who possess it. And what could be more artistic than that?&quot; In the same issue, the newspaper&#x27;s K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation&#x27;s award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all &quot;entertaining, and satirically quite sharp&quot;, but &quot;the art world has chosen not to think [of it as art]... The general view remains that the K Foundation&#x27;s preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn&#x27;t very original. Although they didn&#x27;t blow their entire life&#x27;s savings along the way, other artists, notably Yves Klein and Chris Burden, have been here before.&quot;

&quot;The Guardian&quot; TV reviewer was sceptical. &quot;Snag is, the K men have always dealt in myth and sown a trail of confusion, so nobody quite believes they really burned the money. And if they did, they must be nuts.&quot;

===Later reaction===
In the following years, the burning was mentioned regularly in the press, with Drummond and Cauty often relegated to a cultural status of &quot;the men who burnt a million quid&quot;.

A February 2000 article in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper again insisted that the duo really had burnt one million pounds. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a stunt. They really did it. If you want to rile Bill Drummond, you call him a hoaxer. &#x27;I knew it was real,&#x27; a long-time friend and associate of his group The KLF tells me, &#x27;because afterwards, Jimmy and Bill looked so harrowed and haunted. And to be honest, they&#x27;ve never really been the same since.

A 2004 listener poll by BBC Radio 6 Music saw The KLF/K Foundation placed second after The Who in a list of &quot;rock excesses&quot;.

Drummond&#x27;s former protégé Julian Cope was unimpressed, claiming that Drummond still owed him money. &quot;He burned a million pounds which was not all his, and some of it was mine. People should pay off their creditors before they pull intellectual dry-wank stunts like that.&quot;

==Legacy==
On 17 September 1997, a new film, &quot;This Brick&quot;, was premiered. The film consisted of one three-minute shot of a brick made from the ashes of the money burnt at Jura. It was shown at the Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty&#x27;s performance as 2K.

On 27 September 1997, &quot;K Foundation Burn A Million Quid&quot; (, paperback) was published. The book, by Chris Brook and Gimpo, contains stills from the film and transcriptions of various Q&amp;A sessions from the tour. It also includes a timeline of K Foundation activity and sundry essays including one from Alan Moore. Publisher Ellipsis promoted the book with an advert modelled on those of the K Foundation – &quot;Why did Ellipsis publish K Foundation Burn A Million Quid?&quot; they asked.

Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2000 that he couldn&#x27;t imagine ever feeling regret unless his child was ill and only &quot;an expensive clinic&quot; could cure him. By 2004, however, he had admitted to the BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. &quot;It&#x27;s a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn&#x27;t get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand.&quot;

<text>Lubin (; ) is a city in Lower Silesian Voivodeship in south-western Poland. It is the administrative seat of Lubin County, and also of the rural district called Gmina Lubin, although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town forms a separate urban gmina. As of 2021, the city had a total population of 70,815.

==Geography==
Lubin is situated on the Zimnica river in the Lower Silesian historical region, about northwest of Wrocław and north of Legnica.

The city is one of the major industrial locations in Lower Silesia, with the headquarters of the third-largest Polish corporation, the KGHM Polska Miedź mining company.

== History ==
===Piast dynasty rule===

The area of Lubin lies midway between the main settlements of two West Slavic Ślężanie tribes, the Dziadoszanie and the Trzebowianie, whose lands were both subdued by Mieszko I of Poland about 990. It is unclear which of the two tribes, if either, founded the town. One legend states that the town derives its name from &quot;Luba&quot;, a young man credited with slaying a giant bear that had been terrifying the inhabitants. A papal bull dated to circa 1155 mentions Lubin as one of 13 Silesian castellanies.

According to legend the Polish voivode Piotr Włostowic of Dunin (1080–1153) had a fieldstone church built on the hill in the west of Lubin, where about 1230 a castellany and a village arose that until today is called the &quot;Old City&quot; (). The settlement in the Duchy of Głogów was first mentioned under the Old Polish name of &quot;Lubin&quot; in a 1267 deed by Pope Clement IV as a fiefdom of Trzebnica Abbey.

The New City of what is today Lubin was probably founded in the 1280s under the rule of Duke Przemko of Ścinawa by German settlers, maybe descending from Lower Lorraine or Franconia, in the course of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;. It obtained its city rights about 1295. In 1329 Duke John of Ścinawa paid homage to King John of Bohemia, who upon the death of John&#x27;s brother Duke Przemko II of Głogów in 1331 invaded the lands, which were incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia and shared the political fortunes of the Silesian crown land.

From 1348 Lubin Castle served as the residence of the Piast duke Louis I the Fair and his descendants. In the quarrel with his elder brother Duke Wenceslaus I of Legnica a 1359 judgement by Emperor Charles IV allotted Lubin along with Krzeczyn Wielki, Krzeczyn Mały, Osiek and Pieszków to Louis. About 1353 he had a manuscript on the life of Saint Hedwig of Andechs drawn up, later called &quot;Schlackenwerth&quot; (Ostrov) Codex, which today is kept at the J. Paul Getty Museum. The Castle Chapel in Lubin dates to the 14th century.

In the late 15th century the Lubin parish church was rebuilt in its present-day Gothic style, its high altar was moved to Wrocław Cathedral in 1951. Under the rule of Duke George I of Brieg (died 1521) and his widow Anna of Pomerania, the reformer Caspar Schwenckfeld, born in nearby Osiek, made the town a centre of the Protestant Reformation in Lower Silesia. With Lower Silesia, Lubin in 1526 fell under suzerainty of the Habsburg monarchy. It was devastated several times during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Lubin remained part of the Piast-ruled Duchy of Legnica until 1675, when it was incorporated to the Habsburg-ruled Bohemia.

===Late modern period and World War II===
Conquered in the Silesian Wars by King Frederick II of Prussia in the mid-18th century, the town became a part of Prussia and later, in 1871, Germany. In 1871, after creation of the German Empire, it was connected by rail to Legnica (Liegnitz) and Głogów (Glogau). In reports on their parishes at the end of the 18th century, local pastors wrote about native Poles, who spoke a local dialect of the Polish language. The native Polish population was subjected to planned Germanisation, which lasted until the 1930s. A labour camp of the Reich Labour Service was operated in the town under Nazi Germany.

During World War II about 70% of the town&#x27;s buildings were destroyed. In 1945 between the days of 8–10 February Red Army soldiers mass-murdered 150 German pensioners in an old-people&#x27;s home and 500 psychiatric hospital patients in Lubin. The city eventually became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the 1980s. The remaining German population of the city was either expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, or prohibited from returning home by the communist authorities.

===Discovery of copper deposits===

In 1957 Jan Wyżykowski discovered and in 1959 documented in Lubin the largest copper ore deposits in Europe and one of the largest in the world. Soon copper mines were built and the KGHM company was established.

From 1975 to 1998 it belonged to the former Legnica Voivodeship. In 1982 the city saw significant demonstrations against the martial law declared by the Communist regime, which were put down by its death squads, resulting in the murder of three people.

<doc id="75161" wikidata="Q27613" url="?curid=75161" title="Cadmus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Cadmus (; ) was the legendary Phoenician founder of Boeotian Thebes. He was, alongside Perseus and Bellerophon, the greatest hero and slayer of monsters before the days of Heracles. Commonly stated to be a prince of Phoenicia, the son of king Agenor and queen Telephassa of Tyre, the brother of Phoenix, Cilix and Europa, Cadmus traced his origins back to Poseidon and Libya.

Originally, he was sent by his royal parents to seek out and escort his sister Europa back to Tyre after she was abducted from the shores of Phoenicia by Zeus. In early accounts, Cadmus and Europa were instead the children of Phoenix. Cadmus founded or refounded the Greek city of Thebes, the acropolis of which was originally named &quot;Cadmeia&quot; in his honour.

He is also credited with the foundation of several cities in Illyria, like Bouthoe and Lychnidus. In ancient Greek literature, the end of the mythical narrative of Cadmus and Harmonia is associated with Enchelei and Illyrians, a tradition deeply rooted among the Illyrian peoples.

His parentage was sometimes modified to suit, e.g. claims of Theban origin name his mother as one of the daughters of Nilus, one of the river gods and deity of the Nile river.

==Overview==

Cadmus was credited by the Greek historian Herodotus with introducing the original Phoenician alphabet to the Greeks, who adapted it to form their Greek alphabet. Modern scholarship has almost unanimously agreed with Herodotus concerning the Phoenician source of the alphabet.

Herodotus estimates that Cadmus lived sixteen hundred years before his time, which would be around 2000 BC. Herodotus had seen and described the Cadmean writing in the temple of Apollo at Thebes engraved on certain tripods. He estimated those tripods to date back to the time of Laius the great-grandson of Cadmus. On one of the tripods there was this inscription in Cadmean writing, which, as he attested, resembled Ionian letters: (&quot;Amphitryon dedicated me from the spoils of [the battle of] Teleboae.&quot;).

Although Greeks like Herodotus dated Cadmus&#x27;s role in the founding myth of Thebes to well before the Trojan War (or, in modern terms, during the Aegean Bronze Age), this chronology conflicts with most of what is now known or thought to be known about the origins and spread of both the Phoenician and Greek alphabets. The earliest Greek inscriptions match Phoenician letter forms from the late 9th or 8th centuries BC—in any case, the Phoenician alphabet properly speaking was not developed until around 1050 BC (or after the Bronze Age collapse). The Homeric picture of the Mycenaean age betrays extremely little awareness of writing, possibly reflecting the loss during the Dark Age of the earlier Linear B script. Indeed, the only Homeric reference to writing was in the phrase &quot;σήματα λυγρά&quot;, &quot;sēmata lugra&quot;, literally &quot;baneful signs&quot;, when referring to the Bellerophontic letter. Linear B tablets have been found in abundance at Thebes, which might lead one to speculate that the legend of Cadmus as bringer of the alphabet could reflect earlier traditions about the origins of Linear B writing in Greece (as Frederick Ahl speculated in 1967).

According to Greek myth, Cadmus&#x27;s descendants ruled at Thebes on and off for several generations, including the time of the Trojan War.

==Etymology==
The etymology of Cadmus&#x27;s name remains uncertain. According to one view, the name originates from Phoenician, from the Semitic root &quot;qdm&quot;, which signifies &quot;the east&quot;, the equation of &quot;Kadmos&quot; with the Semitic &quot;qdm&quot; was traced to a publication of 1646 by R. B. Edwards. According to another view, the name is of Greek origin, ultimately from the word &quot;kekasmenos&quot;. (, ).

Possible connected words include the Semitic triliteral root &quot;qdm&quot; () which signifies &quot;east&quot; in Ugaritic, in Arabic, words derived from the root &quot;qdm&quot; include the verb &quot;qdm&quot; meaning &quot;to come&quot; as well as words meaning &quot;primeval&quot; and &quot;forth&quot; as well as &quot;foot&quot;, names derived from it are &quot;Qadim&quot;, which means &quot;the elder one&quot;,─in Hebrew, &quot;qedem&quot; means &quot;front&quot;, &quot;east&quot; and &quot;ancient times&quot;; the verb &quot;qadam&quot; () means &quot;to be in front&quot;, and the Greek &quot;kekasmai&quot; (&lt;*&quot;kekadmai&quot;) &quot;to shine&quot;. Therefore, the complete meaning of the name might be: &quot;He who excels&quot; or &quot;from the east&quot;.

==Wanderings==
===Travel to Samothrace===

After his sister Europa had been carried off by Zeus from the shores of Phoenicia, Cadmus was sent out by his father to find her, and enjoined not to return without her. Unsuccessful in his search—or unwilling to go against Zeus—he came to Samothrace, the island sacred to the &quot;Great Gods&quot; or the Kabeiroi, whose mysteries would be celebrated also at Thebes.

Cadmus did not journey alone to Samothrace; he appeared with his mother Telephassa in the company of his nephew (or brother) Thasus, son of Cilix, who gave his name to the island of Thasos nearby. An identically composed trio had other names at Samothrace, according to Diodorus Siculus: the Pleiad Electra and her two sons, Dardanos and Eetion or Iasion. There was a fourth figure, Electra&#x27;s daughter, Harmonia, whom Cadmus took away as a bride, as Zeus had abducted Europa.

The wedding was the first celebrated on Earth to which the gods brought gifts, according to Diodorus and dined with Cadmus and his bride.

===Founder of Thebes===

Cadmus came in the course of his wanderings to Delphi, where he consulted the oracle. He was ordered to give up his quest and follow a special cow, with a half moon on her flank, which would meet him, and to build a town on the spot where she should lie down exhausted.

The cow was given to Cadmus by Pelagon, King of Phocis, and it guided him to Boeotia, where he founded the city of Thebes.

Intending to sacrifice the cow to Athena, Cadmus sent some of his companions, Deioleon and Seriphus, to the nearby Ismenian spring for water. They were slain by the spring&#x27;s guardian water-dragon (compare the Lernaean Hydra), which was in turn destroyed by Cadmus, the duty of a culture hero of the new order.

He was then instructed by Athena to sow the dragon&#x27;s teeth in the ground, from which there sprang a race of fierce armed men, called the &quot;Spartoi&quot; (&quot;sown&quot;). By throwing a stone among them, Cadmus caused them to fall upon one another until only five survived, who assisted him to build the Cadmeia or citadel of Thebes, and became the founders of the noblest families of that city.

The dragon had been sacred to Ares, so the god made Cadmus do penance for eight years by serving him. According to Theban tellings, it was at the expiration of this period that the gods gave him Harmonia (&quot;harmony&quot;, literally &quot;putting or assembling together&quot;, &quot;good assembly&quot;, or &quot;good composition&quot;) as wife. At Thebes, Cadmus and Harmonia began a dynasty with a son Polydorus, and four daughters, Agave, Autonoë, Ino and Semele. In rare account, the couple instead had six daughters which are called the Cadmiades: Ino, Agaue, Semele, Eurynome, Kleantho and Eurydike.

At the wedding, whether celebrated at Samothrace or at Thebes, all the gods were present; Harmonia received as bridal gifts a &quot;peplos&quot; worked by Athena and a necklace made by Hephaestus. This necklace, commonly referred to as the Necklace of Harmonia, brought misfortune to all who possessed it. Notwithstanding the divinely ordained nature of his marriage and his kingdom, Cadmus lived to regret both: his family was overtaken by grievous misfortunes, and his city by civil unrest. Cadmus finally abdicated in favor of his grandson Pentheus, and went with Harmonia to Illyria, to fight on the side of the Enchelii. Later, as king, he founded the city of Lychnidos and Bouthoe.

Nevertheless, Cadmus was deeply troubled by the ill-fortune which clung to him as a result of his having killed the sacred dragon, and one day he remarked that if the gods were so enamoured of the life of a serpent, he might as well wish that life for himself. Immediately he began to grow scales and change in form. Harmonia, seeing the transformation, thereupon begged the gods to share her husband&#x27;s fate, which they granted (Hyginus).

In another telling of the story, the bodies of Cadmus and his wife were changed after their deaths; the serpents watched their tomb while their souls were translated to the fields. In Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, Cadmus is given a prophecy by Dionysus whereby both he and his wife will be turned into snakes for a period before eventually being brought to live among the blest.

== Genealogy ==
Cadmus was of ultimately divine ancestry, the grandson of the sea god Poseidon and Libya on his father&#x27;s side, and of Nilus (the River Nile) on his mother&#x27;s side; overall he was considered a member of the fifth generation of beings following the (mythological) creation of the world:


==Offspring==
With Harmonia, he was the father of Semele, Polydorus, Autonoe, Agave and Ino. Their youngest son was Illyrius. According to Greek mythology, Cadmus is the ancestor of Illyrians and Theban royalty.

== Samothracian connection ==
The fact that Hermes was worshipped in Samothrace under the name of Cadmus or Cadmilus seems to show that the Theban Cadmus was interpreted as an ancestral Theban hero corresponding to the Samothracians. Another Samothracian connection for Cadmus is offered via his wife Harmonia, who is said by Diodorus Siculus to be daughter of Zeus and the Samothracian Electra, who was one of the seven Pleides.

== Modern scholarship ==
=== Origins of Cadmus and his myth ===
The question of Cadmus&#x27;s eastern origin have been debated for a long time in modern scholarship.

Homer mentions Cadmus only once, but he had already referred to the inhabitants of Thebes with the name &quot;Cadmeans&quot;. Aeschylus and Sophocles, in particular, repeatedly mention the &quot;city of Cadmus&quot; and &quot;Cadmeans&quot;, relating Thebes with Cadmus. Also Euripides linked Thebes with Cadmus, but he was one of the earliest authors and the only tragedian to mention &quot;Cadmus the Tyrian&quot;. Herodotus refers to Cadmus the Tyrian, and he was the first to mention Cadmus&#x27;s &#x27;Phoenician&#x27; origins, but he certainly was not the initiator of this transformation, as his &quot;Histories&quot; provides evidence that the myth was already widespread. Since Herodotus Cadmus has been commonly described as a prince of Phoenicia. According to Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), Cadmus had Theban origins.

Modern historian Albert Schachter has suggested that Cadmus was a fictitious hero named after the Thebean acropolis and was made &#x27;Phoenician&#x27; due to the influence of immigrants from the East to Boeotia. According to M. L. West the myth of Cadmus and Harmonia at Thebes originated from 9th or 8th century BC Phoenician residents in the city. According to Jason Colavito, although modern scholars have debated on whether the myth came from Phoenicia, there is evidence that the core of Cadmus&#x27;s myth originated in Near Eastern stories of the battle between a hero and a dragon. The myth of Cadmus the Phoenician was not a literal reinterpretation of an original Phoenician myth, although being probably inspired by one, rather it was the Greeks&#x27; interpretation of the Phoenician civilization and the benefits they acquired from it, specifically the alphabet. According to archaeologist John Boardman, the &quot;Phoenicians&quot; who came with Cadmus, were not &quot;Phoenicians&quot;, but rather Greeks who had lived in the Near East for a while and had returned to teach what they had learned there, including the alphabet.

Given the absence of a Phoenician colony in Thebes, several hypotheses arguing against Cadmus&#x27;s eastern origin have been proposed by modern scholars:

;Mycenaean hypothesis
According to historian Frederick M. Ahl, scholarly suggestions that Cadmus was a Mycenaean must be taken into account against Cadmus&#x27; Phoenician origin, as for him it is becoming harder and harder to reconcile literary and archaeological evidence, not to mention epigraphical difficulties. Ahl rather suggest that &quot;Cadmus was a Mycenaean, and the writing he brought to Thebes was Linear B, which may have been known to Greek-speaking peoples then or later as &quot;φοινικήια γράμματα&quot;.&quot;

;Cretan hypothesis
Henry Hall set forth an hypothesis, arguing that Cadmus and the Cadmeians came from Crete. There are a number of difficulties involved in this hypothesis, however, notably the assertion that Mycenaean society resulted from the triumph of the Minoan civilization over the mainland one.

;Argive hypothesis
Cadmus was used as an identification figure by the Argives, representing an intriguing example of mythical requisition in relation to the wars between Argos and Thebes. According to the Argive legend, Cadmus&#x27;s father Agenor was descended from the Argive princess Io. In this light, Cadmus becomes an Argive and Thebes his &quot;home away from home&quot;, which is connected with the emergence of hybrid identities during the period of the Great Colonization.

=== Hittite records controversy ===
It has been argued by various scholars that in a letter from the King of Ahhiyawa to the Hittite King, written in the Hittite language in c. 1250 BC, a specific Cadmus was mentioned as a forefather of the Ahhijawa people. The latter term most probably referred to the Mycenaean world (Achaeans), or at least to a part of it. Nevertheless, this reading about a supposed Cadmus as historical person is rejected by most scholars.

==Legacy==
The Syrian city of Al-Qadmus is named after Cadmus.
* E. Nesbit&#x27;s 1901 novel &quot;The Wouldbegoods&quot; includes an episode in which the children protagonists sow what they believe are dragon&#x27;s teeth, and the next day, &quot;just like Cadmus,&quot; they find an encampment of soldiers there.

<text>In Greek mythology, Rhadamanthus () or Rhadamanthys () was a wise king of Crete. As the son of Zeus and Europa he was considered a demigod. He later became one of the judges of the dead and an important figure in Greek mythology.

His name, whose etymology is obscure, was later used to allude to persons showing stern and inflexible judgement.

== Family ==
Rhadamanthus was, according to mythology, the son of Zeus and Europa and brother to Sarpedon and Minos (also a king and later a judge of the dead). Together with his brother, Rhadamanthus was raised by Asterion, their stepfather. He had two sons, Gortys (associated with Gortyn, Crete) and Erythrus (founder of Erythrae).

A different tradition represents Rhadamanthys as the son of Hephaestus, Hephaestus as a son of Talos, and Talos as a son of Cres, the personification of Crete. This tradition is reported by Pausanias, who cites the poet Cinaethon of Sparta as his source. According to Athenaeus, the lyric poet Ibycus wrote of Rhadamanthys as the lover of Talos, rather than grandson. The Suda, a Byzantine encyclopedia from the tenth-century CE, adds to this that Talos and Rhadamanthus introduced homosexuality to Crete.

Other sources (e.g. Plutarch, &quot;Theseus&quot; 20) credit Rhadamanthys rather than Dionysus as the husband of Ariadne, and the father of Oenopion, Staphylus and Thoas. In this account, Ariadne was the daughter of Minos, Rhadamanthys&#x27;s brother; another Ariadne was the daughter of Minos&#x27;s grandson and namesake, who features in Theseus&#x27;s legend and was rescued by Dionysus.

== Mythology ==

===Legislation===

Although he was frequently considered one of the judges of the dead in the underworld, he was also known for a few legislative activities. There is a reference to a law of Rhadamanthus ordering the Cretans to swear oaths by animals and to another law of Rhadamanthus saying if people defend themselves against others who initiated violence then they should suffer no penalty. His legislation, and its subsequent analogue in Lacadaemonian Sparta, is briefly described in Book I of Plato&#x27;s Laws, after he is introduced as the brother of Minos, and credited with being the justest of men and an administrator of justice.

===Exile from Crete===
King Asterius died childless and Minos inherited the throne. When Minos became the king of Crete, he drove Rhadamanthus out of Crete, because he had been jealous of his popularity. Rhadamanthus fled to Boeotia, where he married Alcmene, widow of Amphitryon and mother of Heracles. According to some traditions, he became a tutor to Heracles. This is also mentioned by John Tzetzes, a medieval historian.

In general, the particular sphere of activity of Rhadamanthus tends to be the Aegean islands, apart from Crete itself, where Minos was active. He is also often connected by ancient authors with central Greece.

=== Afterlife ===
According to later legends (c. 400 BC), on account of his inflexible integrity he was made one of the judges of the dead in the lower world, together with his half-brother Aeacus and his full-brother Minos. He was supposed to judge the souls of easterners, Aeacus those of westerners, while Minos had the casting vote (Plato, &quot;Gorgias&quot; 524A). He is portrayed in Books 4 and 7 of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Virgil (69–18 BC) makes Rhadamanthus one of the judges and punishers of the unworthy in the Underworld (Tartarus) section of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;.

Homer represents him as dwelling in the Elysian Fields (&quot;Odyssey&quot; iv. 564), the paradise for the immortal sons of Zeus. Pindar says that he is the right-hand man of Cronus (now ruling Elysium) and was the sole judge of the dead. Lucian depicts Rhadamanthus as presiding over the company of heroes on the Isles of the Blest in &quot;True History&quot;.

<text>Chenonceaux () is a commune in the French department of Indre-et-Loire, and the region of Centre-Val de Loire, France.

It is situated in the valley of the river Cher, a tributary of the Loire, about 26 km (16 mi) east of Tours and on the right bank of the Cher.

The population of permanent residents hovers about 350, but there is a large influx of tourists during the summer months because the village adjoins the former royal Château de Chenonceau, one of the most popular tourist destinations in France. The château is distinctive in being built across the river. The village is also situated in Touraine-Chenonceaux wine-growing area, and bordered on its northern edge by the Forest of Amboise.

==Name==
The difference in spelling between the Château&#x27;s name (Chenonceau) and the village (Chenonceaux) is attributed to Louise Dupin de Francueil, owner of the château during the French Revolution, who is said to have dropped the &quot;x&quot; at the end of its name to differentiate what was a symbol of royalty from the Republic. As a result of her good relations with the village, the Château was spared the iconoclastic damage suffered by many other monuments during the Revolution. Although no official sources have been found to support this claim, the Château has ever since been referred to and spelled as Chenonceau.

Mme Dupin hosted the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in Chenonceau as tutor to her children, and among her descendants was the writer George Sand, born Aurore Dupin.

<doc id="75178" wikidata="Q922713" url="?curid=75178" title="Whose Line Is It Anyway? (British TV series)">
<text>Whose Line is it Anyway? (shortened to Whose Line? or WLIIA) is a short-form improvisational comedy television panel show created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, presented by Clive Anderson, and produced for Channel 4 between 23 September 1988 and 4 February 1999. The programme features a panel of four performers, (six in the Christmas special), conducting a series of short-form improvisation games, creating comedic scenes per predetermined situations made by the host or from suggestions by the audience. Such games include creating sound effects, performing a scene to different television and film styles, using props, and making up a song on the spot. The programme originally began as a short-lived BBC radio programme, before the concept was adapted for television.

During its history, the programme featured a variety of noted comedians from Britain, America and Canada. Frequent performers during the show&#x27;s run included John Sessions, Stephen Fry, Archie Hahn, Josie Lawrence, Paul Merton, Rory Bremner, Tony Slattery, Mike McShane, Greg Proops, Ryan Stiles, Sandi Toksvig, Jim Sweeney, Colin Mochrie, Steve Steen, Stephen Frost, Chip Esten, Brad Sherwood, Caroline Quentin and Wayne Brady. The programme was mainly recorded in Britain, though several episodes of series 3 and 4 were made in New York, while the tenth and final series was shot entirely in California.

The success of &quot;Whose Line?&quot; spawned several domestic and international adaptations. An American version aired on ABC between 1998 and 2007 and was revived on The CW in 2013, and is broadcast in multiple countries. &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway? Australia&quot; debuted on The Comedy Channel in 2016. Two similarly themed British comedy programmes, &quot;Mock the Week&quot; (2005–2022) and &quot;Fast and Loose&quot; (2011), were created by Patterson.

== History ==

In 1988, Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson approached the BBC with a concept for a new comedy programme, involving a group of performers conducting games that encompassed improvisational comedy. The title of their concept was a comedic riposte to the radio programme &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, which had recently moved to a television format, merged to the title of a 1972 play, &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot;. Their pitch was well liked by the broadcaster, who green-lighted a radio programme for broadcast on BBC Radio 4, commissioning six episodes. Both Patterson and Leveson opted for it to be presented by Clive Anderson, with John Sessions and Stephen Fry as the regular performers accompanied by two guest stars each episode, while music was provided by Colin Sell.

After the radio series came to an end, Patterson and Leveson began discussions with the BBC on creating a televised adaption of their concept. However, the broadcaster was hesitant on making the move, leading to the pair being approached by Channel 4, who eagerly liked the idea, and securing a deal from the producers to bring the programme to their channel. The move to television was initially hit with a problem, as while it was desired for the regular cast to appear on the first televised series, Fry had begun to dislike conducting improvisational comedy. The matter was resolved by allowing him to pull out, with Sessions convinced by Fry to remain as a permanent performer for the first series (Fry did agree to appear in two episodes of the first series, and would make a surprise return to the show in 1997 for one episode in series 9). In addition, Sell was unable to perform on the programme, resulting in Richard Vranch - a member of improvisational group, The Comedy Store Players, based at London&#x27;s Comedy Store - becoming the resident musician for much of the programme&#x27;s broadcast.

&quot;Whose Line&quot; proved a success when aired on Channel 4, effectively helping to boost the careers of some of its regular performers that appeared during early episodes, including several members from The Comedy Store Players - these included Paul Merton, Josie Lawrence and Sandi Toksvig - and comedy actor Tony Slattery. At times, the programme also featured a number of celebrities who made occasional appearances during the earlier series, such as Peter Cook, Jonathan Pryce and Griff Rhys Jones. After appearing in every episode of the first series, Sessions reduced his involvement with the show, making his last appearance in series 3. While the programme drew from the talent of British comedians, it also expanded to recruiting those from America, including Greg Proops and Mike McShane, both formerly of San Francisco improv group Faultline. During 1991 and 1992, several episodes of series 3 and 4 were filmed in New York. By series 5, other projects led to several regular performers, including Lawrence and McShane, to appear on the show less frequently, while others, including Merton, made their last appearances in this series. Slattery and Proops continued to appear regularly, as did American comedian Ryan Stiles and Canadian comedian Colin Mochrie. Stiles and Mochrie proved to be very popular with viewers, and the show&#x27;s ratings continued to improve. Stiles eventually became a permanent performer on the show, appearing in every episode from series 7 onwards, as did Mochrie from series 8 onwards.

As the series progressed, the viewing figures of &quot;Whose Line&quot; began to drop after reaching the peak of its popularity in series 6. Part of the problem was due to the constant use of regular performers, leaving little room for new talent to be showcased, one of the main appeals of the programme&#x27;s early years. The departure of Slattery, one of the show&#x27;s most popular performers, after series 7 also affected ratings. During this period, the show still occasionally saw one-off celebrity guest performers, including George Wendt and Eddie Izzard. By series 10, filming of the programme moved to Hollywood, California. With the exception of Anderson still as presenter, the show&#x27;s cast was now entirely North American, with fresh talent found in comedians such as Wayne Brady, while Vranch was replaced by Laura Hall as the in-house musician. However, after the broadcast of its final episode in February 1999, Channel 4 decided to axe the programme following the eventual slump in the show&#x27;s viewing figures. Repeats of &quot;Whose Line&quot; continued following its cancellation, though with episodes edited and reformatted as a result.

== Format ==
Most television episodes of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; featured four performers (with the exception of six in the 1989 Christmas special) who sit in a line of chairs at the back of the stage. The host, Clive Anderson, sat at a desk facing the large performance area in front of the performers. Anderson introduced each performer with a joke or pun, usually all related on a common theme or topic.

The show is made up of games that are scored by Anderson, who declared arbitrary point values after the game, often citing a humorous reason for his decision. The points are purely decorative, served no practical purpose, and were often awarded to the audience or other arbitrary third persons. The styles of the games are varied (see Games, below). Some feature all four performers, while others feature fewer. The performers who are not involved in a game remain in their seats at the back of the stage. Humorous banter between Anderson and the performers between games is also sometimes included, with Anderson and Greg Proops play-arguing with each other becoming a regular feature over time.

At the conclusion of each episode, a winner or several winners are chosen arbitrarily by Anderson. The &quot;prize&quot; for winning the show is to read out the closing credits in a certain style, chosen by Anderson, as they scrolled on screen.

Episodes were culled down from longer recording sessions with the best game performances chosen to compile into one or more episodes. Each series includes one or two compilation episodes of unaired games from different taping sessions in that series.

=== Games ===
The number and type of games played vary from episode to episode, and whilst some games such as &quot;Questions Only&quot; and &quot;Hoedown&quot; became more common over time, others such as &quot;Authors&quot; and &quot;Remote Control&quot; faded from use. New games were created throughout the show&#x27;s run. Some games, such as &quot;Tag,&quot; are based on traditional improv games, while others are uniquely created for the series. Most games consist of a single long skit performed by the chosen performers, but some, such as &quot;World&#x27;s Worst&quot; and &quot;Scenes from a Hat,&quot; are played as a rapid-fire series of short skits.

While all games are designed to test the performer&#x27;s improvisational skill, some also test other skills, such as singing or doing impressions. &quot;Whose Line?&quot; features a number of musical games, which features the show&#x27;s resident musicians (Richard Vranch or Laura Hall) playing live backing music. Occasionally, pre-recorded music is also used. Some performers, such as Josie Lawrence, Mike McShane, Chip Esten and Wayne Brady, particularly excelled in the musical games, while others, although they were good sports about it, openly despised performing in them, particularly Paul Merton, Stephen Fry and Ryan Stiles. During games like &quot;Rap&quot; and &quot;Hoedown&quot;, Fry would almost never even attempt to sing or rap, and instead would just talk about the subject of the song. In one game of Rap, Fry actually did attempt some rapping, albeit half-heartedly, but gave up out of embarrassment after a few words. Stiles would frequently inject insults into the Hoedown whenever he is forced to sing it, usually pointed at Anderson or just the fact he was having to perform a Hoedown yet again. Colin Mochrie would generally speak his lines instead of singing them for musical games.

Some games require suggestions or topics. Depending on the game, these may be solicited directly from the studio audience during the taping, or written down by the audience and/or production staff in advance and then randomly drawn for the performers&#x27; use. Anderson used a buzzer to signal the end of a game, or of individual sections in the rapid-fire games.

==Cast==

The show was presented for its entire run by Clive Anderson, who is the only person to appear in all 136 episodes. Richard Vranch was the in-house musician for the first nine series (1988–1998). Vranch was replaced by Laura Hall for the tenth and last series (1998–1999).

The following are all the performers who appeared on the show. They are listed in order of most number of episodes, with those who appeared in the same number of episodes listed alphabetically.
==Episodes==

== DVD release ==
The first DVD of the UK show, featuring every episode of the first two series, was released in America on 27 March 2007 by A&amp;E Home Entertainment, and in the UK on 25 January 2008 by Channel 4. The UK edition is edited to remove references to the ad breaks. There were also two VHS releases (in the UK only) during the 1990s.

== Legacy ==
In 1998, shortly before the programme&#x27;s cancellation by Channel 4, Ryan Stiles introduced the programme&#x27;s format to fellow comedian Drew Carey, who took great interest and subsequently pitched an American version of the same name to the ABC TV network with great success. Their pitch was to conduct the same variety of improvisational comedy-styled games as the British original, with Carey hosting the programme, and both Stiles and Colin Mochrie being permanent performers. The American version largely maintained the same style as the UK version, with only a few minor variations. As well as Stiles and Mochrie, a few other veterans of the UK original - Wayne Brady, Greg Proops, Brad Sherwood and Chip Esten - also appeared regularly on the show, with Brady very quickly (after the first few episodes as a semi-regular) joining Stiles and Mochrie as a permanent performer. The American version of &quot;Whose Line&quot; ran on ABC from 1998 to 2007, and returned in 2013 on The CW with new host Aisha Tyler.

On 6 March 2011, over twelve years after the series finale, a special edition of the show, with Clive Anderson returning as host, was recorded for &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;, a marathon of UK panel shows, in aid of Comic Relief. The recording was broadcast live on the Comic Relief website at about 9:30am, while the edited compilation shows for the event were shown between 13 and 17 March on BBC Three. The format was adjusted to feature five performers, with veterans Josie Lawrence, Tony Slattery and Neil Mullarkey appearing alongside Humphrey Ker and David Walliams.

In 2017, a stage-version of the show appeared at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe hosted by Anderson, with original cast members Josie Lawrence, Mike McShane, Greg Proops and Colin Mochrie among the performers. The initial shows were a sell-out and extra dates and shows were put on. Sell-out runs followed at the London Palladium and The Royal Albert Hall, with Chip Esten and Brad Sherwood also returning. In April 2019, it was announced that the stage-version of the show would be returning to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, with two more original cast members, Tony Slattery and Stephen Frost.

<text>Esko Tapani Aho (born 20 May 1954) is a Finnish politician who was prime minister of Finland from 1991 to 1995.

== Early life and career ==
Aho was born in Veteli, Finland. Prior to attending university, he began a career in politics. From 1974 to 1979, he was chairman of the Finnish Centre Youth, many of whose previous chairmen had risen to high political positions. In 1978, he became a presidential elector, a position he also held in 1982 and 1998. From 1979 to 1980, Aho was political secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1980 to 1983, he was a trade promoter for the municipality of Kannus.

Aho studied at the University of Helsinki, graduating with a Master of Social Science degree in 1981.

Since 2010 he has been a member of the board of the Skolkovo Innovation Center. Currently, he is a visiting professor at Sciences Po, Paris.

== Parliamentary career ==
Aho was first elected to the Finnish Parliament (eduskunta) in 1983. He became chairman of the Centre Party in 1990, a position that he held until 2002. The party was at the time one of three major political parties in Finland.

At 36 years of age, he was the youngest prime minister in Finnish history.

Aho was the prime minister of a centre-right coalition government (Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Christian Democrats and Swedish People&#x27;s Party) from 1991 to 1995. He is best known for leading Finland into the European Union. Aho&#x27;s own party, most of whose voters lived and live in rural areas, was the most opposed to EU membership among major parties. The greatest concern of these voters was the EU&#x27;s effect on Finnish agriculture, but they were persuaded to support membership due to the prime minister&#x27;s diplomacy. Finland applied for EU membership on 16 March 1992, and a referendum was held two and a half years later. Aho&#x27;s government also faced the deep economic depression of the early 1990s. Despite a steep rise in the national debt, the Aho government applied a stringent policy of austerity that made it unpopular. This partly caused its fall in the 1995 election and the Centre Party&#x27;s eight-year period in the opposition.

Aho had the nickname &quot;Kennedy of Kannus&quot; Kannus being his hometown) due to his streamlined and well coiffed habitus reminiscent of John F. Kennedy.

Esko Aho lost the bid for President of Finland to Tarja Halonen in 2000. He subsequently retired from active politics, initially in the form of a &quot;sabbatical leave&quot; of one year, during which he led a study group on the EU in the 2000 fall semester at Harvard University (where he was a resident fellow at the Institute of Politics). In the 2003 election he left parliament and retired from daily politics. He then served as the president of the Finnish national innovation fund SITRA (the Finnish National Fund for Research and Development).

In 2008, Aho&#x27;s name was included in an opinion poll on possible presidential candidates, in which he ranked last.

On 1 November 2008, Aho became Nokia&#x27;s executive vice president of corporate relations and responsibility and became a member of its executive board.

At the time of his rise to prime minister, he was the youngest head of government in Europe.

== Banks ==
Aho became a member of the board of directors of the Russian Sberbank in 2016. He resigned from the position in February 2022 following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

== Honors ==

* Order of the White Rose of Finland (Finland, 1992)

<text>Bos (from Latin &quot;bōs&quot;: cow, ox, bull) is a genus of bovines, which includes, among others, wild and domestic cattle. 

&quot;Bos&quot; is often divided into four subgenera: &quot;Bos&quot;, &quot;Bibos&quot;, &quot;Novibos&quot;, and &quot;Poephagus&quot;, but including these last three divisions within the genus &quot;Bos&quot; without including &quot;Bison&quot; is believed to be paraphyletic by many workers on the classification of the genus since the 1980s. The genus as traditionally defined has five extant species, but this rises to eight when the domesticated varieties are counted as separate species, and ten when the closely related &quot;Bison&quot; is also included. Most but not all modern breeds of domesticated cattle (including taurine cattle and zebu) are believed to have originated from the extinct aurochs. Others like Bali cattle and gayal are thought to have originated from South and Southeast Asian &quot;Bos&quot; species.

==Description==

The species are grazers, with large teeth to break up the plant material they ingest. They are ruminants, having a four-chambered stomach that allows them to break down plant material.

==Distribution==
There are about 1.3 billion domestic cattle alive today, making them one of the world&#x27;s most numerous mammals. Members of this genus are currently found in Africa, Asia, Europe, parts of North America, South America and also in Oceania. Their habitats vary greatly depending on the particular species; they can be found in prairies, rain forests, wetlands, savannah and temperate forests.

==Ecology==
Most &quot;Bos&quot; species have a lifespan of 18–25 years in the wild, with up to 36 being recorded in captivity. They have a 9–11 month gestation, depending on the species and birth one or, rarely, two young in the spring.

Most species travel in small herds ranging in size from ten to thirty members. Within most herds, there is one bull (male) for all the cows (female). Dominance is important in the herds; calves will usually inherit their mother&#x27;s position in the hierarchy.

They are generally diurnal, resting in the hot part of the day and being active morning and afternoon. In areas where humans have encroached on the territory of a herd, they may turn nocturnal. Some species are also migratory, moving with food and water availability.

==Taxonomy==
In 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature resolved a long-standing dispute about the naming of those species (or pairs of species) of &quot;Bos&quot; that contain both wild and domesticated forms. The commission &quot;conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms&quot;, confirming &quot;Bos primigenius&quot; for the aurochs and &quot;Bos gaurus&quot; for the gaur. If domesticated cattle and gayal are considered separate species, they are to be named &quot;Bos taurus&quot; and &quot;Bos frontalis&quot;; however, if they are considered part of the same species as their wild relatives, the common species are to be named &quot;Bos primigenius&quot; and &quot;Bos gaurus&quot;.

During the 2010s, analysis of the complex genetics of the bovine lineages determined that the genus &quot;Bison&quot; needed to be relegated to a subgenus of &quot;Bos&quot; in order to retain monophyly within &quot;Bos&quot; since both extant species of &quot;Bison&quot; are phylogenetically embedded within &quot;Bos&quot;. The specific relationships in these analyses determined that the two living bison species were each other&#x27;s closest living relatives, with their closest relatives amongst &quot;Bos&quot; being the yaks based on nuclear DNA. The mitochondrial DNA for the wisent was found to contradict the nuclear DNA result, and was more closely related to those of cattle, while the mitochondrial DNA of the American bison supported the nuclear DNA result of a close relationship with yaks. The discrepancy between the mitochondrial DNA of the American bison and wisent is suggested to be likely due to incomplete lineage sorting or genetic introgression into &quot;B. bonasus&quot; from other &quot;Bos&quot; species.

Relationships of members of the genus &quot;Bos&quot; based on nuclear genomes after Sinding, et al. 2021.

<doc id="75182" wikidata="Q738237" url="?curid=75182" title="Walcheren">
<text>Walcheren () is a region and former island in the Dutch province of Zeeland at the mouth of the Scheldt estuary. It lies between the Eastern Scheldt in the north and the Western Scheldt in the south and is roughly the shape of a rhombus. The two sides facing the North Sea consist of dunes and the rest of its coastline is made up of dykes. Middelburg, the provincial capital, lies at Walcheren&#x27;s centre. Vlissingen, to the south, is the main harbour and the third municipality is Veere.

Originally, Walcheren was an island, but the Sloedam, constructed in 1871 for a railway, and poldering after World War II have connected it to the (former) island of Zuid-Beveland, which in turn was connected to the North Brabant mainland by the Kreekrakdam (Completed in 1867). The Veerse Gatdam, completed in 1961, has connected Walcheren to Noord-Beveland.

==Etymology==
Walcheren is first attested in Latinized spelling, such as &quot;villam Walichrum&quot; ca. 790 and &quot;Vualacra&quot; ca. 837. Germanic spellings start appearing around the High Middle Ages, like Old Dutch &quot;Walacheri&quot; ca. 1150. The name is most likely a compound of &quot;*wal(a)c&quot;, meaning &quot;moist&quot;, and &quot;*heri/*hara&quot;, indicating a sandy ridge. Another, less likely theory suggests that the name derives from &quot;Walhaz&quot;, the name Germans used for Romans.

==History==

===Early history===
The Romans called the island &quot;Wallacra&quot;. As early as Roman times, the island functioned as a point of departure for ships going to Britain; it had a temple of the goddess Nehalennia who was popular with those who braved the waters of the North Sea. 

Walcheren became the seat of the Danish Viking Harald (fl. 841–842), who conquered what would become the Netherlands together with his brother Rorik (fl. 842–873) (or Rurik) in the ninth century. One fringe theory has it that Ahmad ibn Rustah (fl. 10th century) described Walcheren when reporting on the seat of the Rus&#x27; Khaganate.
Another fringe theory mentions Walcheren as the seat of Hades, described by Homer.

The island played a role in the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. The Spanish fleet was not able to be supported by deep water ports along the continental side of the English Channel. The Duke of Parma had occupied Antwerp, a deep water port. However, access to this port was blocked by Dutch rebels and English fighters who occupied Walcheren. As a result, the armada could not be resupplied nor could it seek shelter at Antwerp. Facing dwindling supplies, Admiral Medina-Sedonia fled northward, ending the threat to the English. 

===Treaty of Dover===

Under the Secret Treaty of Dover, concluded in 1670 between Charles II of England and Louis XIV of France, England was supposed to get possession of Walcheren as well as the isle of Cadzand, as the reward for helping France in the then impending war against the Dutch Republic. In the event, the Dutch resistance — much stronger than anticipated — managed to repulse the French-English attack, and the treaty was not implemented.

===Napoleonic Wars===
Beginning on 30 July 1809, a British expeditionary force of 39,000 men landed on Walcheren, intending to assist the Austrians in their efforts against Napoleon and attack the French Navy fleet moored at Flushing. The expedition turned into a disaster, as although British troops captured Flushing the Austrians had already been decisively defeated at the Battle of Wagram in early July and were suing for peace. Meanwhile, the French fleet had moved to Antwerp, and the expeditionary lost over 4,000 men to a disease called &quot;Walcheren Fever&quot;, thought to be a combination of malaria and typhus, compared to only 106 men to enemy action. The French and Dutch defenders, meanwhile, suffered approximately 4,000 men killed, wounded or captured. With the strategic reasons for the campaign gone and the worsening conditions, the British withdrew in December.

===World War II===

Strategically situated at the mouth of the River Scheldt, Walcheren was the key that allowed use of the deep-water port of Antwerp, located further upstream on the right bank of the southern estuary of the river. It was fought over during World War II in 1940 between Dutch and German troops in the Battle of the Netherlands, and again in 1944 in the Battle of Walcheren Causeway, the fourth and final stage of the Battle of the Scheldt. On 3 October 1944 the RAF bombed the sea wall at Westkapelle causing the Inundation of Walcheren. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division cleared South Beveland to the east and approached the island on 31 October 1944. The plan was to cross the Sloe Channel, but leading troops of the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade found that assault boats were useless in the deep mud of the channel. The only route open was the 40 metre wide Walcheren Causeway, a mile-long land bridge from South Beveland to the island. The Canadian Black Watch sent a company across on the evening of 31 October, but was stopped. The Calgary Highlanders sent two companies over in succession, the second attack opening up a bridgehead on the island. The Highlanders were eventually thrown back, having lost 64 killed and wounded. &quot;Le Régiment de Maisonneuve&quot; relieved them on the causeway, followed by the 1st Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders of the British 52nd Infantry Division. Meanwhile, on 1 November 1944, British Commandos landed in the village of Westkapelle in order to silence the German coastal batteries looking out over the Scheldt. The amphibious assault (&quot;Operation Infatuate&quot;) proved a success and by 8 November, all German resistance on the island had ceased.

<doc id="75185" wikidata="Q159575" url="?curid=75185" title="Hugh Capet">
<text>Hugh Capet (; ; 941 – 24 October 996) was the King of the Franks from 987 to 996. He is the founder of and first king from the House of Capet. The son of the powerful duke Hugh the Great and his wife Hedwige of Saxony, he was elected as the successor of the last Carolingian king, Louis V. Hugh was descended from Charlemagne&#x27;s son Pepin of Italy through his paternal grandmother, and was also a nephew of Otto the Great.

The dynasty he founded ruled France for nearly nine centuries: from 987 to 1328 in the senior line, and until 1848 via cadet branches (with an interruption from 1792 to 1814 and briefly in 1815).

==Descent and inheritance==
Hugh was the son of Hugh the Great, Duke of the Franks, and Hedwige of Saxony, daughter of the German king Henry the Fowler. His birth date is not given by any source, but modern scholars often date his birth to circa 941. The son of Hugues Le Grand, duke of Francia, Hugh Capet is traditionally considered the founder of the third dynasty of French Kings, the Capetians&quot;. He was born into a well-connected and powerful family with many ties to the royal houses of France and Germany.

Through his mother, Hugh was the nephew of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor; Henry I, Duke of Bavaria; Bruno the Great, Archbishop of Cologne; and finally, Gerberga of Saxony, Queen of France. Gerberga was the wife of Louis IV, King of France and mother of Lothair of France and Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine.

His paternal family, the Robertians, were powerful landowners in the Île-de-France. His grandfather had been King Robert I. King Odo was his granduncle and Emma of France, the wife of King Rudolph, was his aunt. Hugh&#x27;s paternal grandmother Beatrice of Vermandois was a patrilineal descendant of Charlemagne.

==Rise of the Robertians==
After the end of the ninth century, the descendants of Robert the Strong became indispensable in carrying out royal policies. As Carolingian power failed, the great nobles of West Francia began to assert that the monarchy was elective, not hereditary, and twice chose Robertians (Odo I (888–898) and Robert I (922–923)) as kings, instead of Carolingians.

Robert I, Hugh the Great&#x27;s father, was succeeded as King of the Franks by his son-in-law, Rudolph of Burgundy. When Rudolph died in 936, Hugh the Great had to decide whether he ought to claim the throne for himself. To claim the throne would require him to risk an election, which he would have to contest with the powerful Herbert II, Count of Vermandois, father of Hugh, Archbishop of Reims, and allied to Henry the Fowler, King of Germany; and with Hugh the Black, Duke of Burgundy, brother of the late king. To block his rivals, Hugh the Great brought Louis d&#x27;Outremer, the dispossessed son of Charles the Simple, from his exile at the court of Athelstan of England to become king as Louis IV.

This maneuver allowed Hugh to become the most powerful person in France in the first half of the tenth century. Once in power, Louis IV granted him the title of &quot;dux Francorum&quot; (&quot;Duke of the Franks&quot;). Louis also (perhaps under pressure) officially declared Hugh &quot;the second after us in all our kingdoms&quot;. Hugh also gained power when Herbert II of Vermandois died in 943, because Herbert&#x27;s powerful principality was then divided among his four sons.

Hugh the Great came to dominate a wide swath of central France, from Orléans and Senlis to Auxerre and Sens, while the king was rather confined to the area northeast of Paris (Compiègne, Laon, Soissons).

==French monarchy in the 10th century==
The realm in which Hugh grew up, and of which he would one day be king, bore little resemblance to modern France. Hugh&#x27;s predecessors did not call themselves kings of France, and that title was not used by his successors until the time of his descendant Philip II. Kings ruled as &quot;rex Francorum&quot; (&quot;King of the Franks&quot;), the title remaining in use until 1190 (but note the use of &quot;FRANCORUM REX&quot; by Louis XII in 1499, by Francis I in 1515, and by Henry II about 1550, and on French coins up to the eighteenth century.) The lands they ruled comprised only a small part of the former Carolingian Empire. The eastern Frankish lands, the Holy Roman Empire, were ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, represented by Hugh&#x27;s first cousin Otto II and then by Otto&#x27;s son, Otto III. For a time loyalty to the Carolingians remained strong in the lands south of the river Loire after Charles the Simple was deposed in 922. Both the Duchy of Normandy and the Duchy of Burgundy were largely autonomous, and Brittany entirely soalthough from 956 Burgundy was ruled by Hugh&#x27;s brothers Otto and Henry.

==France under Ottonian influence==
In 956, when his father Hugh the Great died, Hugh, the eldest son, was then about fifteen years old and had two younger brothers. Otto I, King of Germany, intended to bring western Francia under his control, which was possible since he was the maternal uncle of Hugh Capet and Lothair of France, the new king of the Franks, who succeeded Louis IV in 954, at the age of 13.

In 954, Otto I appointed his brother Bruno, Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Lorraine, as guardian of Lothair and regent of the kingdom of France. In 956, Otto gave him the same role over Hugh and the Robertian principality. With these young princes under his control, Otto aimed to maintain the balance between Robertians, Carolingians, and Ottonians. In 960, Lothair agreed to grant to Hugh the legacy of his father, the margraviate of Neustria and the title of Duke of the Franks. But in return, Hugh had to accept the new independence gained by the counts of Neustria during Hugh&#x27;s minority. Hugh&#x27;s brother, Otto received only the duchy of Burgundy (by marriage). Andrew W. Lewis has sought to show that Hugh the Great had prepared a succession policy to ensure his eldest son much of his legacy, as did all the great families of that time.

The West was dominated by Otto I, who had defeated the Magyars in 955, and in 962 assumed the restored imperial title. The new emperor increased his power over Western Francia with special attention to certain bishoprics on his border; although elected by Lothair, Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims, had imperial sympathies. Disappointed, King Lothair relied on other dioceses (Langres, Chalons, Noyon) and on Arnulf I, Count of Flanders.

==Hugh, Duke of the Franks==

In 956, Hugh inherited his father&#x27;s estates, in theory making him one of the most powerful nobles in the much-reduced kingdom of West Francia. As he was not yet an adult, his mother acted as his guardian, and young Hugh&#x27;s neighbours took advantage. Theobald I of Blois, a former vassal of Hugh&#x27;s father, took the counties of Chartres and Châteaudun. Farther south, on the border of the kingdom, Fulk II of Anjou, another former client of Hugh the Great, carved out a principality at Hugh&#x27;s expense and that of the Bretons.

The royal diplomas of the 960s show that the nobles were faithful not only to the Duke of the Franks, as in the days of Hugh the Great, but also to King Lothair. Indeed, some in the royal armies fought against the Duchy of Normandy on behalf of Lothair. Finally, even Hugh&#x27;s position as second man in the kingdom seemed to slip. Two charters of the Montier-en-Der Abbey (968 and 980) refer to Herbert III, Count of Vermandois, while Count of Chateau-Thierry, Vitry and lay abbot of Saint-Médard of Soissons, bearing the title of &quot;Count of the Franks&quot; and even &quot;count of the palace&quot; in a charter of Lothair.

For his part, Lothair also lost power with the ascendance of the Ottonian monarchy. It waned by participating in the gathering of relatives and vassals of Otto I in 965. However, from the death of the emperor in 973, Lothair wanted to revive the policy of his grandfather to recover Lorraine. Otto&#x27;s son and successor, Otto II, appointed his cousin, Charles, brother of Lothair, as Duke of Lower Lorraine. This infuriated both Lothair and Hugh, whose sister, Beatrice was the regent for the young Duke Theodoric I of Upper Lorraine. In 978, Hugh thus supported Lothair in opening a war against Otto.

In August 978, accompanied by the nobles of the kingdom, Lothair surprised and plundered Aachen, residence of Otto II, forcing the imperial family to flee. After occupying Aachen for five days, Lothair returned to France after symbolically disgracing the city. In September 978, Otto II retaliated against Lothair by invading France with the aid of Charles. He met with little resistance on French territory, devastating the land around Rheims, Soissons, and Laon. Otto II then had Charles crowned as King of France by Theodoric I, Bishop of Metz. Lothair then fled to the French capital of Paris where he was besieged by Otto II and Charles. Sickness among his troops brought on by winter, and a French relief army under Hugh Capet, forced Otto II and Charles to lift the siege on 30 November and return to Germany. On the journey back to Germany, Otto&#x27;s rearguard, unable to cross the Aisne in flood at Soissons, was completely wiped out, &quot;and more died by that wave than by the sword.&quot; This victory allowed Hugh Capet to regain his position as the first noble of the Frankish kingdom.

==Hugh aids Archbishop of Reims==
Until the end of the tenth century, Reims was the most important of the archiepiscopal seats of France. Situated in Carolingian lands, the archbishop claimed the primacy of Gaul and the privilege to crown kings and direct their chancery. Therefore, the Archbishop of Reims traditionally had supported the ruling family and had long been central to the royal policy. But the episcopal city was headed by Adalberon of Rheims, nephew of Adalberon of Metz (a faithful prelate to the Carolingians), elected by the King Lothair in 969, but who had family ties to the Ottonians. The Archbishop was assisted by one of the most advanced minds of his time, the schoolmaster and future Pope Sylvester II Gerbert of Aurillac. Adalberon and Gerbert worked for the restoration of a single dominant empire in Europe. King Lothair, 13 years old, was under the tutelage of his uncle Otto I. But upon reaching his majority, he became independent, which defeated their plans to bring the whole of Europe under a single crown. Therefore, they turned their support from Lothair to Hugh Capet.

Indeed, for the Ottonian to make France a vassal state of the empire, it was imperative that the Frankish king was not of the Carolingian dynasty, and not powerful enough to break the Ottonian tutelage. Hugh Capet was for them the ideal candidate, especially since he actively supported monastic reform in the abbeys while other contenders continued to distribute church revenues to their own partisans. Such conduct could only appeal to Reims, who was very close to the Cluniac movement.

==Reign of Louis V==
With the support of Adalberon of Reims, Hugh became the new leader of the kingdom. Gerbert d&#x27;Aurillac stated that &quot;Lothair is king of France in name alone; Hugh is, however, not in name but in effect and deed.&quot; 

In 979, Lothair sought to ensure his succession by associating his eldest son with the throne. Hugh Capet supported him and summoned the great nobles of the kingdom. The ceremony took place at Compiègne, in the presence of the king, of Arnulf (an illegitimate son of the king), and of Archbishop Adalberon, under Hugh&#x27;s blessing. The congregation acclaimed Louis V, following the Carolingian custom, and the archbishop anointed the new king of the Franks.

The following year, Lothair, seeing the growing power of Hugh, decided to reconcile with the Emperor Otto II by agreeing to renounce Lorraine. But Hugh did not want the king and the emperor reconciled, so he quickly took the fortress of Montreuil, and then went to Rome. There he met the emperor and the pope, with his confidants Burchard I of Vendôme and Arnulf of Orléans. Tension mounted between Lothair and Hugh. The king married his 15-year-old son Louis to Adelaide of Anjou, who was then more than 40 years old. She brought with her Auvergne and the county of Toulouse, enough to pincer the Robertian territories from the south. However, the marriage failed and the couple separated two years later.

At the death of Otto II in 983, Lothair took advantage of the minority of Otto III and, after making an alliance with the Duke of Bavaria, decided to attack Lorraine. Hugh was careful not to join this expedition.

When the king took Verdun and imprisoned Godfrey (brother of the Archbishop of Reims), Adalberon and Gerbert sought the aid of the duke of the Franks. But Lothair&#x27;s enterprises came to naught when he died in March 986.

Louis V, following Louis IV and Lothair, declared that he would take the counsels of the duke of the Franks for his policies. It seems the new king wished to launch an offensive against Reims and Laon because of their rapprochement with the empire. Sources are vague on Hugh&#x27;s role at this time, but it would be his interest to limit the king&#x27;s excessive pretensions. Louis summoned the archbishop of Reims at his palace at Compiègne to answer for his actions. But while hunting in the forest of Senlis, Louis was killed in a riding accident on 22 May 987.

==Hugh elected King of Franks==

In May 987, chroniclers, including Richerus and Gerbert of Aurillac, wrote that in Senlis &quot;died the race of Charles&quot;. However, even if Louis died childless, there remained a Carolingian who could ascend the throne: Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, brother of Lothair, uncle of Louis V, first cousin of Hugh Capet through their mothers.

This was nothing extraordinary; it was not the first time that a Robertian would be competing with a Carolingian. In the time of Hugh the Great, the Robertians found it expedient to support the claim of a Carolingian. By 987, however, times had changed. For ten years, Hugh Capet had been openly competing against his king, and appeared to have subjected the great vassals. And his opponent Charles of Lorraine was accused of all evils: he wanted to usurp the crown (978), had allied himself with the emperor against his brother, and had defamed Queen Emma of Italy, his brother&#x27;s wife. The archbishop of Reims convened the greatest lords of France at Senlis and denounced Charles of Lorraine for not maintaining his dignity, having made himself a vassal of the Emperor Otto II and marrying a woman from a lower class of nobility. Then he promoted the candidacy of Hugh Capet:

Crown the Duke. He is most illustrious by his exploits, his nobility, his forces. The throne is not acquired by hereditary right; no one should be raised to it unless distinguished not only for nobility of birth, but for the goodness of his soul.

Hugh was crowned &quot;rex Francorum&quot; on 1 June, in Noyon, and again on 3 July 987, in Paris. Immediately after his coronation, Hugh began to push for the coronation of his son Robert. The archbishop, wary of establishing hereditary kingship in the Capetian line, answered that two kings could not be created in the same year. Hugh claimed, however, that he was planning an expedition against the Moorish armies harassing Borrel II, Count of Barcelona (a vassal of the French crown), and that the stability of the country necessitated two kings should he die while on expedition. Ralph Glaber, however, attributes Hugh&#x27;s request to his old age and inability to control the nobility. Modern scholarship has largely imputed to Hugh the motive of establishing a dynasty against the pretension of electoral power on the part of the aristocracy, but this is not the typical view of contemporaries and even some modern scholars have been less skeptical of Hugh&#x27;s &quot;plan&quot; to campaign in Spain. Robert was eventually crowned on 25 December that same year.

===Election contested by Charles of Lorraine===

Charles of Lorraine, the Carolingian heir, contested the succession. He drew support from the Count of Vermandois, a cadet of the Carolingian dynasty; and from the Count of Flanders, loyal to the Carolingian cause. Charles took Laon, the seat of Carolingian royalty. Hugh Capet and his son Robert besieged the city twice, but were compelled to withdraw each time. Hugh decided to make an alliance with Theophano (regent for her son Otto III), but she never replied.

When Adalberon, Archbishop of Reims, died, the archbishopric was contested by his right-hand man, Gerbert of Aurillac, and Arnulf, illegitimate son of King Lothair of France (and nephew of Charles of Lorraine). Choosing Arnulf to replace Adalberon seemed a great gamble, but Hugh made it anyway, and chose him as archbishop instead of Gerbert, in order to appease Carolingian sympathizers and the local populace. Following the customs of those times, he was made to invoke a curse upon himself if he should break his oath of fidelity to Hugh. Arnulf was duly installed, and was confirmed by the pope.

Yet to Arnulf the ties of blood with his uncle Charles was the stronger than the oath he had given Hugh. Gathering the nobles in his castle, Arnulf sent one of his agents and opened the gates of the city to Charles. Arnulf acted as if terrified, and took the nobles with him to a tower, which he had emptied out of supplies beforehand. Thus was the city of Reims compelled to surrender; to keep up appearances, Arnulf and Charles denounced each other, until Arnulf swore fealty to Charles.

Great was the predicament of Hugh, and he began doubting whether he could win the contest by force. Adalberon, bishop of Laon, whom Charles expelled when he took the city, had sought the protection of Hugh Capet. The bishop made overtures to Arnulf and Charles, to mediate a peace between them and Hugh Capet. Adalberon was received by Charles favorably, but was made to swear oaths that would bring curses upon himself if broken. Adalberon swore to them all, &quot;I will observe my oaths, and if not, may I die the death of Judas.&quot; That night the bishop seized Charles and Arnulf in their sleep, and delivered them to Hugh. Charles was imprisoned in Orléans until his death. His sons, born in prison, were released.

==Dispute with the papacy==
After the loss of Reims by the betrayal of Arnulf, Hugh demanded his deposition by Pope John XV. But the pope was then embroiled in a conflict with the Roman aristocracy. After the capture of Charles and Arnulf, Hugh resorted to a domestic tribunal, and convoked a synod at Reims in June 991. There, Gerbert testified against Arnulf, which led to the archbishop&#x27;s deposition and Gerbert being chosen as replacement.

Pope John XV rejected this procedure and wished to convene a new council in Aachen, but the French bishops refused and confirmed their decision in Chelles (winter 993–994). The pope then called them to Rome, but they protested that the unsettled conditions en route and in Rome made that impossible. The Pope then sent a legate with instructions to call a council of French and German bishops at Mousson, where only the German bishops appeared, the French being stopped on the way by Hugh and Robert.

Gerbert, supported by other bishops, advocates for the independence of the churches vis-à-vis Rome (which is controlled by the German emperors). Through the exertions of the legate, the deposition of Arnulf was finally pronounced illegal. To avoid excommunication of the bishops who sat in the council of St. Basle, and thus a schism, Gerbert decided to let go. He abandoned the archdiocese and went to Italy. After Hugh&#x27;s death, Arnulf was released from his imprisonment and soon restored to all his dignities. Under the auspices of the emperor, Gerbert eventually succeeded to the papacy as Pope Sylvester II, the first French pope.

==Extent of power==
Hugh Capet possessed minor properties near Chartres and Angers. Between Paris and Orléans he possessed towns and estates amounting to approximately . A plot in 993, masterminded by Adalberon, Bishop of Laon and Odo I of Blois, was to deliver Hugh Capet into the custody of Otto III. The plot failed, but the fact that no one was punished illustrates how tenuous was his hold on power. Beyond his power base, in the rest of France, there were still as many codes of law as there were fiefdoms. Uniting all this into one cohesive unit was a formidable task and a constant struggle between those who wore the crown of France and its feudal lords. Therefore, Hugh Capet&#x27;s reign was marked by numerous power struggles with the vassals on the borders of the Seine and the Loire.

While Hugh Capet&#x27;s military power was limited and he had to seek military aid from Richard I of Normandy, his unanimous election as king gave him great moral authority and influence. Adémar de Chabannes records, probably apocryphally, that during an argument with the Count of Auvergne, Hugh demanded of him: &quot;Who made you count?&quot; The count riposted: &quot;Who made you king?&quot;.

==Legacy==

Hugh Capet died on 24 October 996, and was interred in the Basilica of Saint-Denis. His son Robert continued to reign.

Most historians regard the beginnings of modern France as having initiated with the coronation of Hugh Capet. This is because, as Count of Paris, he made the city his power centre. The monarch began a long process of exerting control of the rest of the country from there.

He is regarded as the founder of the Capetian dynasty. The direct Capetians, or the House of Capet, ruled France from 987 to 1328; thereafter, the Kingdom was ruled by cadet branches of the dynasty. All French kings through Louis Philippe, and all royals since then, have belonged to the dynasty. Furthermore, cadet branches of the House continue to reign in Spain and Luxembourg.

All monarchs of the Kingdom of France from Hugh Capet to Philip II of France were titled &#x27;King of the Franks&#x27;. Documents during Philip II&#x27;s reign began using the title &#x27;King of France&#x27; as dawn of the intimate unification of medieval French population even though Latin was the main language.

==Marriage and issue==
Hugh Capet married Adelaide, daughter of William Towhead, Count of Poitou. Their children are as follows:
* Gisela, or Gisele, who married Hugh I, Count of Ponthieu
* Hedwig, or Hathui, who married Reginar IV, Count of Hainaut
* Robert II, who became king after the death of his father

A number of other daughters are less reliably attested.

==Prophecy==

According to tradition, sometime in 981, Hugh Capet recovered the relics of St. Valery, which had been stolen by the Flemings, and restored them to their proper resting place. The saint appeared to the duke in a dream, and said: &quot;For what you have done, you and your descendants shall be kings unto the seventh generation&quot;. When he became king, Hugh refused to wear the insignia of royalty, hoping that it would extend his descendants&#x27; reign by one generation.

By the literal interpretation, Capetian kingship would thus have ended with Philip Augustus, the seventh king of his line. Figuratively, seven meant completeness, and would mean that the Capetians would be kings for ever. In fact, Capetian kingship lasted until 1848 in France, although the current King of Spain and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg are Capetians.

==Reception==
Italian poet Dante Alighieri features Hugh Capet as a character in &quot;Purgatorio&quot;, the second canticle of the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. The pilgrim meets Capet on the fifth terrace of Mount Purgatory among souls performing penitence for avarice (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; 20). In this portrayal, Capet acknowledges himself as the &quot;root of the obnoxious plant / that shadows all the Christian lands&quot; (&quot;Purg.&quot; 20.43-44). The metaphor of the root of the plant is reminiscent of a family tree. Dante thus condemns Hugh as a main source of the evil that has pervaded and corrupted the French monarchy. Dante&#x27;s personal resentment towards Hugh&#x27;s legacy likely stemmed from the fact that his exile had been caused by interference in Florentine politics by the French crown and Pope Boniface VIII in the early fourteenth century. In this way, the &quot;obnoxious plant&quot; of the Capetians casts a shadow over both the papacy and the chance for an emperor that might bring order to Italy, Dante&#x27;s &quot;two suns.&quot;

The myth of Capet&#x27;s humble origins is another crucial component of Dante&#x27;s representation of this historical figure in &quot;Purgatorio&quot;. Though the notion that Capet was the son of a butcher is rightfully reported by critics to be untrue—he was the son of a duke—situating Capet in a lower social position is vital for Dante. This framing draws the Frankish king closer to Dante&#x27;s own experience as a member of the lower aristocracy, and makes Capet&#x27;s rise to power feel more extreme. In penance for grasping so high above himself in life, Capet and the other avaricious souls of this terrace must lie face down into the rock. The souls inch slowly up the mountain where they lay, acting in moderation in purgatory, when on earth they moved through life guided by greed.

<text>Natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory that reduces lexicons down to a set of semantic primitives. It is based on the conception of Polish professor Andrzej Bogusławski. The theory was formally developed by Anna Wierzbicka at Warsaw University and later at the Australian National University in the early 1970s, and Cliff Goddard at Australia&#x27;s Griffith University.

==Approach==
The natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) theory attempts to reduce the semantics of all lexicons down to a restricted set of semantic primitives, or primes. Primes are universal in that they have the same translation in every language, and they are primitive in that they cannot be defined using other words. Primes are ordered together to form explications, which are descriptions of semantic representations consisting solely of primes.

Research in the NSM approach deals extensively with language and cognition, and language and culture. Key areas of research include lexical semantics, grammatical semantics, phraseology and pragmatics, as well as cross-cultural communication.

Dozens of languages, including representatives of 16 language groups, have been studied using the NSM framework. They include English, Russian, Polish, French, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Malay, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Ewe, Wolof, East Cree, Koromu, at least 16 Australian languages, and a number of creole languages including Trinidadian creole, Roper River Kriol, Bislama and Tok Pisin.

Apart from the originators Anna Wierzbicka and Cliff Goddard, a number of other scholars have participated in NSM semantics, most notably Bert Peeters, Zhengdao Ye, Felix Ameka, Jean Harkins, Marie-Odile Junker, Anna Gladkova, Jock Wong, Carsten Levisen, Helen Bromhead, Karen Stollznow, Adrian Tien, Carol Priestley, Yuko Asano-Cavanagh and Gian Marco Farese.

==Semantic primes==
Semantic primes (also known as semantic primitives) are concepts that are &quot;universal&quot;, meaning that they can be translated literally into any known language and retain their semantic representation, and &quot;primitive&quot;, as they are proposed to be the most simple linguistic concepts and are unable to be defined using simpler terms.

Proponents of the NSM theory argue that every language shares a core vocabulary of concepts. In 1994 and 2002, Goddard and Wierzbicka studied languages across the globe and found strong evidence supporting this argument.

Wierzbicka&#x27;s 1972 study proposed 14 semantic primes. That number was expanded to 60 in 2002 by Wierzbicka and Goddard, and the current agreed-upon number is 65.

Each language&#x27;s translations of the semantic primes are called exponents. Below is a list of English exponents, or the English translation of the semantic primes. It is important to note that some of the exponents in the following list are polysemous and can be associated with meanings in English (and other languages) that are not shared. However, when used as an exponent in the Natural semantic metalanguage, it is only the prime concept which is identified as universal.

The following is a list of English exponents of semantic primes adapted from Levisen and Waters (eds.) 2017.

===NSM syntax===
NSM primes can be combined in a limited set of syntactic frames that are also universal. These valency options specify the specific types of grammatical functions that can be combined with the primes. While these combinations can be realized differently in other languages, it is believed that the meanings expressed by these syntactic combinations are universal.

Examples of valency frames for the &quot;say&quot; semantic prime:

* someone said something→[minimal frame]
* someone said: &#x27;––&#x27;→[direct speech]
* someone said something to someone→[plus &#x27;addressee&#x27;]
* someone said something about something/someone→[plus &#x27;locutionary topic&#x27;]

===Explications===
A semantic analysis in the NSM approach results in a reductive paraphrase called an explication that captures the meaning of the concept explicated. An ideal explication can be substituted for the original expression in context without change of meaning.

For example: &quot;Someone X broke something Y&quot;:

:someone X did something to something Y
:because of this, something happened to Y at the same time
:it happened in one moment
:because of this, after this Y was not one thing anymore
:people can think about it like this: &quot;it can&#x27;t be one thing anymore&quot;

==Semantic molecules==
Semantic molecules are intermediary words used in explications and cultural scripts. While not semantic primes, they can be defined exclusively using primes. Semantic molecules can be determined as words that are necessary to build upon to explicate other words. These molecules are marked by the notation [m] in explications and cultural scripts. Some molecules are proposed to be universal or near-universal, while others are culture- or area-specific.

Examples of proposed universal molecules:
==Applications==
===Minimal English===
Minimal English is a derivative of the natural semantic metalanguage research, with the first major publication in 2018. It is a reduced form of English designed for non-specialists to use when requiring clarity of expression or easily translatable materials. Minimal English uses an expanded set of vocabulary to the semantic primes. It includes the proposed universal and near-universal molecules, as well as non-universal words which can assist in clarity. As such, it already has counterparts targeted at speakers of other natural languages, e.g. Minimal French, Minimal Polish, 65 Sanaa (&quot;Minimal Finnish&quot;) and so on. Minimal English differs from other simple Englishes (such as Basic English) as it has been specifically designed for maximal cross-translatability.

===Language engineering===
Applications of NSM have also been proposed for natural-language processing, natural-language understanding and artificial intelligence.

===Revivalistics===
Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann suggests that NSM can be of benefit in (language revitalization) as it &quot;can neutralize the Western semantic bias involved in reconnecting with ancient Aboriginal traditions using English, and may allow a fuller understanding of the original meaning of the Aboriginal lexical items.&quot;

<doc id="75196" wikidata="Q318741" url="?curid=75196" title="Jean-Antoine Houdon">
<text>Jean-Antoine, chevalier Houdon (; 20 March 1741 – 15 July 1828) was a French neoclassical sculptor.

Houdon is famous for his portrait busts and statues of philosophers, inventors and political figures of the Enlightenment. Houdon&#x27;s subjects included Denis Diderot (1771), Benjamin Franklin (1778-1809), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1778), Voltaire (1781), Molière (1781), George Washington (1785–1788), Thomas Jefferson (1789), Louis XVI (1790), Robert Fulton (1803–04), and Napoléon Bonaparte (1806).

==Biography==
Houdon was born in Versailles, on 20 March 1741.
In 1752, he entered the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, where he studied with René-Michel Slodtz, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, and Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. From 1761 to 1764, he studied at the École royale des élèves protégés.

Houdon won the Prix de Rome in 1761, but was not greatly influenced by ancient and Renaissance art in Rome. His stay in the city is marked by two characteristic and important productions: the superb écorché (1767), an anatomical model which has served as a guide to all artists since his day, and the statue of Saint Bruno in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome. 
After four years in Italy, Houdon returned to Paris.

He submitted &quot;Morpheus&quot; to the Salon of 1771. He developed his practise of portrait busts.
He became a member of the Académie de peinture et de sculpture in 1771, and a professor in 1778. In 1778, he modeled Voltaire, producing a portrait bust with wig for the Comédie-Française; one for the Palace of Versailles, and one for Catherine the Great.

In 1778, he joined the masonic lodge Les Neuf Sœurs, where he later met Benjamin Franklin, and John Paul Jones.
For Salon of 1781, he submitted a &quot;Diana&quot; which was refused without drapery.

Houdon&#x27;s portrait sculpture of Washington was the result of a specific invitation by Benjamin Franklin to cross the Atlantic in 1785, specifically to visit Mount Vernon, so that Washington could model for him. Washington sat for wet clay life models and a plaster life mask. 
These models served for many commissions of Washington, including the standing figure commissioned by the Virginia General Assembly, for the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond. 
Numerous variations of the Washington bust were produced, portraying him variously as a general in uniform, in the classical manner showing chest musculature, and as Roman Consul Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus clad in a toga.

In the 1780s, Houdon produced two semi-nude sculptures, &quot;Winter&quot; and &quot;Bather&quot;.

Perceived as bourgeois for his connections to the court of Louis XVI, he fell out of favour during the French Revolution, although he escaped imprisonment. 
Houdon returned to favor during the French Consulate and Empire, being taken on as one of the original artistic team for what became the Column of the Grande Armée at Wimille.
He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur, on 17 December 1804. He was created a &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Empire&quot; in 1809, which was made hereditary by letters patent in 1816.Houdon died in Paris on 15 July 1828, and was interred at the Montparnasse Cemetery.

==Family==
On 1 July 1786, he married Marie-Ange-Cecile Langlois; they had three daughters: Sabine, Anne-Ange, and Claudine.

==Legacy and influence==
Houdon&#x27;s sculptures were used as models for the engravings used on various U.S. postage stamps of the late 19th and early 20th centuries which depict Washington in profile.

<doc id="75197" wikidata="Q3092549" url="?curid=75197" title="Félix Mayol">
<text>Félix Mayol (18 November 1872 – 26 October 1941) was a French singer and entertainer.

==Career==
Mayol was born in Toulon, France. His parents, amateur singers and actors, arranged for Felix to make his debut stage at six years of age. In 1895, he went to the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris where he began a career in entertainment that spanned more than forty years. He adopted a campy effeminate manner on stage as part of his theatrical persona.

He sang the famous song &quot;Viens poupoule, viens poupoule, viens...&quot;, and performed many songs by Théodore Botrel.
In the early years of the 20th century some of Mayol&#x27;s performances were captured by an early form of talking picture. He would record his voice, then the motion picture camera would film him as he lip-synced to the record. Several of his Phonoscènes exist.

==Other activities==
The teenaged Maurice Chevalier took a risk by impersonating Mayol in small-time cafe entertainments, Mayol reportedly recognised the young man&#x27;s talent and gave him his blessing, which led Chevalier to the Casino de Paris and the Folies Bergère.

Shortly after World War I, he purchased a plot of land in Toulon and donated it to the local sports club, RC Toulonnais, for the building of a stadium. The facility, named Stade Mayol in his honor, remains in use today (after several renovations) as the home ground for the Toulon rugby team.

==Personal life==
Mayol never married, and many stories circulated of his homosexual liaisons, including an attempt to seduce Chevalier. His brother, Charles Mayol, founded a music publishing company to print his works.

<doc id="75200" wikidata="Q1229856" url="?curid=75200" title="Marie-Louise Damien">
<text>Marie-Louise Damien (born Louise Marie Damien; 5 December 1889 – 30 January 1978), better known by the stage name Damia, was a French singer and actress.

==Early life==
Louise Marie Damien was born on 5 December 1889 to Marie Joséphine Louise (née Claude) and Nicolas Damien on rue Jeanne d&#x27;Arc in the 13th arrondissement of Paris. Her father was a police sergeant in Lorraine and she was raised in a family of eight siblings. Running away from home after being sent to a reform school, Damien arrived in Paris when she was fifteen.

==Career==
Damien initially worked as a model and actress playing bit parts with the Théâtre du Châtelet, but by 1909 was performing as a dancer, using the stage name Marise Damia, with Max Dearly in London. After returning from London, she was encouraged to sing by the impresario Robert Hollard, who used the stage name &quot;Roberty&quot;. Hollard was the husband of the singer, Fréhel, at the time and his affair with Damia ended his stormy marriage. Her singing debut occurred in 1911 at the Pépinière and was followed by a performance at the Alhambra, which was arranged by Harry Fragson. He also arranged for her to perform at the Alcazar d&#x27;Été, where she worked with Maurice Chevalier. When Fragson was murdered by his father, Damia left France in 1913 and went to the United States. Performing on Broadway until 1916, she returned to France and during the remainder of the war sang on the war front.

==Felix Mayol and Loie Fuller==
After being seen by Félix Mayol, one of the leading male singing stars at the time, she was hired by him to perform at his concerts. Despite this, her career evolved slowly, taking second billing for a number of years but with help in her stage presentation from the American dancer, Loie Fuller, she eventually became a singing star. At the beginning of World War I she opened Le Concert Damia, in Montmartre, where she became the first star ever to have a single spotlight trained on her face, bare arms and hands. From this point in her career she became the most important exponent of the &quot;chanson réaliste&quot; genre until Édith Piaf came along in 1936. Her nickname was &quot;la tragédienne de la chanson&quot;, and amongst her big hits were &quot;Les goélands&quot;, &quot;Johnny Palmer&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est mon gigolo&quot; and &quot;Tu ne sais pas aimer&quot;—the last-named song later became a theme for French people with AIDS.

==Eileen Gray==
Around 1922, Damia became the lover of the architect Eileen Gray, who was a member of a circle of lesbians that included Fuller and her lover Gab Sorère, Natalie Barney and Romaine Brooks. Upon Fuller&#x27;s death in 1928, Damia and Sorère became lovers.

==Films==
In 1927, she appeared in the film, &quot;Napoléon&quot; directed by Abel Gance with early silent film stars Antonin Artaud, Philippe Hériat, Annabella, and Suzanne Bianchetti. Her other film successes included &quot;Sola&quot; and &quot;Notre Dame De Paris&quot;, alongside Anthony Quinn. Damia had enduring appeal that stretched to audiences as far away as Japan, where she toured in 1953.

==Farewell tour==
A few years later she did a farewell tour, ending her more than forty-year career in a double bill with Marie Dubas in front of a full house at the Paris Olympia. Her actual swansong, however, was singing &quot;Les Croix&quot; on &quot;La joie de vivre d&#x27;Edith Piaf&quot;, in 1956.

When asked in 1974 by the Anglo-French biographer David Bret to divulge the secret of her long life and fabulous voice, Damia replied, &quot;Three packs of Gitanes a day!&quot;

==Death==
Damia died on 30 January 1978 at La Celle-Saint-Cloud, a western suburb of Paris, and was interred in the Cimetière de Pantin. Today, she is considered to be the second greatest singer of &quot;chansons réalistes&quot;, after Edith Piaf.

<doc id="75204" wikidata="Q152807" url="?curid=75204" title="Alice Prin">
<text>Alice Ernestine Prin (2 October 1901 – 29 April 1953), nicknamed the Queen of Montparnasse and often known as Kiki de Montparnasse, was a French model, chanteuse, memoirist and painter during the Jazz Age. She flourished in, and helped define, the liberated culture of Paris in the so-called Années folles (&quot;crazy years&quot; in French). She became one of the most famous models of the 20th century and in the history of avant-garde art.

== Early life ==
Born as an illegitimate child in Châtillon-sur-Seine, Côte d&#x27;Or, Alice Prin had &quot;a wretched childhood that could only lead to laughter or despair&quot;. She was raised in abject poverty by her grandmother. At age twelve, she was sent by train to live with her mother, a linotypist, in Paris in order to help earn an income for her family. Harsh, degrading jobs followed, and she worked in printing shops, shoe factories and bakeries. During this time, she began her lifelong joy of decorating herself. She &quot;would crumble a petal from her mother&#x27;s fake geraniums to give color to her cheeks and was fired from a nasty job at a bakery because she darkened her eyebrows with burnt matchsticks&quot;.

By the age of fourteen, Prin&#x27;s &quot;large and splendid body&quot; had garnered the artistic and sexual attention of various Parisian denizens, and she began surreptitiously posing nude for sculptors. &quot;It bothered me a little to take off my clothes,&quot; Prin wrote her in her memoirs, but &quot;it was the custom&quot;. Her decision to become a nude model created discord with her mother. One day, her mother unexpectedly intruded into an artist&#x27;s studio in a rage, denounced Prin as a shameless prostitute, and disowned her forever.

Now without money or a roof over her head, the teenage Kiki determined to make her living exclusively by posing for artists. As a beautiful dark-haired girl, she soon found herself in popular demand. At the time, she had scant pubic hair, and when posing, she occasionally drew fake hair with a piece of charcoal. As her fame grew, she became a local celebrity who symbolized the Montparnasse quarter&#x27;s nonconformity and its rejection of the social norms of the .

== Modeling career ==
Adopting a single name, &quot;Kiki&quot;, Prin became a fixture of the Montparnasse social scene and a popular model, posing for dozens of artists, including Sanyu, Chaïm Soutine, Julien Mandel, Tsuguharu Foujita, Constant Detré, Francis Picabia, Jean Cocteau, Arno Breker, Alexander Calder, Per Krohg, Hermine David, Pablo Gargallo and Tono Salazar. Moïse Kisling painted a portrait of Kiki titled &quot;Nu assis&quot;, one of his best known. In his 1976 book &quot;Memoirs of Montparnasse&quot;, Canadian poet John Glassco recalled that: 

In Autumn 1921, Prin met the American visual artist Man Ray, and the two soon entered into a stormy eight-year relationship. She lived with Man Ray in his studio on rue Campagne-Première until 1929 during which time he made hundreds of portraits of her. She became his muse at the time and the subject of some of his best-known images, including the surrealist image &quot;Le Violon d&#x27;Ingres&quot; (Ingres&#x27; Violin) and &quot;Noire et blanche&quot; (Black and White).

During their turbulent relationship, Man Ray labored obsessively on Prin&#x27;s makeup and visual image. He &quot;took her many steps beyond the primitive charcoal eyebrow-pencil she used for makeup as a teenager.&quot; Every night before going out together, he &quot;meticulously applied her cosmetics and assisted in the choice of her clothes, creating a visual style that is as much a part of his &quot;oeuvre&quot; as any of his signed paintings&quot;. Her makeup often varied in &quot;the color, thickness, and angle according to his mood. Her heavy eyelids, next, might be done in copper one day and royal blue another, or else in silver and jade.&quot;

By 1929, Prin had reached the zenith of her fame. She had appeared in nine short and frequently experimental films, including Fernand Léger&#x27;s 1923 Dadaist work &quot;Ballet mécanique&quot; without any credit. A symbol of bohemian and creative Paris and of the possibility of being a woman and finding an artistic place, she was elected the &quot;Queen of Montparnasse&quot; at age 28. Despite her local fame, she continued to live a hand-to-mouth existence. Even during difficult times, she maintained her positive attitude, saying &quot;all I need is an onion, a bit of bread, and a bottle of red [wine]; and I will always find somebody to offer me that.&quot;

== Artwork and autobiography ==

A painter in her own right, Prin had a sold-out exhibition of her paintings in 1927 at the Galerie au Sacre du Printemps in Paris. Signing her work with her chosen single name, &quot;Kiki&quot;, her drawings and paintings comprise portraits, self-portraits, social activities, fanciful animals and dreamy landscapes composed in a light, slightly uneven, expressionist style that is a reflection of her carefree manner and boundless optimism.

In 1929, she published an autobiography titled &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;, with Ernest Hemingway and Tsuguharu Foujita providing introductions. In 1930, the book was translated by Samuel Putnam and published in Manhattan by Black Manikin Press, but it was immediately banned by the United States government. A copy of the first US edition was held in the section for banned books in the New York Public Library through the 1970s. However, the book had been reprinted under the title &quot;The Education of a Young Model&quot; throughout the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., a 1954 edition by Bridgehead has the Hemingway Introduction and photos and illustrations by Mahlon Blaine).

These editions were mainly put out by unscrupulous publisher Samuel Roth. Taking advantage that banned books did not receive copyright protection in the U.S., Roth put out a series of supposedly copyrighted editions (which never was registered with the Library of Congress) which altered the text and added illustrations—line drawings and photographs—which were not by Prin. After 1955, Roth appended an extra ten chapters falsely credited to Prin 23 years after the original book, including an invented visit to New York where she met with Roth himself. None of this was true. The original autobiography finally saw a new translation and publication in 1996.

For a few years during the 1930s, Prin owned the Montparnasse cabaret L&#x27;Oasis, which was later renamed Chez Kiki. Her music hall performances in black hose and garters included crowd-pleasing risqué songs, which were uninhibited, yet inoffensive. She later departed Paris to avoid the occupying German army during World War II, which entered the city in June 1940. She did not return to live in the city immediately after the war.

== Death and legacy ==
Prin died at age 51 on 29 April 1953 after collapsing outside her flat in Montparnasse, apparently of complications of alcoholism or drug dependence. At the time of her death, she weighed . A large crowd of artists and admirers attended her Paris funeral and followed the procession to her interment in the &quot;Cimetière parisien de Thiais&quot;. Her tomb identifies her as: &quot;Kiki, 1901–1953, singer, actress, painter, Queen of Montparnasse&quot;.

&quot;Life&quot; magazine featured a three-page obituary of Prin in its 29 June 1953 edition, concluding with a memory from one of her friends who said: &quot;We laughed, my God how we laughed.&quot; Tsuguharu Foujita remarked that, with Kiki&#x27;s death, the glorious days of Montparnasse were buried forever.

Long after her death, Prin remains the embodiment of the outspokenness, audacity and creativity that marked the interwar period of life in Montparnasse. She represents a strong artistic force in her own right as a woman. In 1989, biographers Billy Klüver and Julie Martin called her &quot;one of the century&#x27;s first truly independent women&quot;. In her honor, a daylily has been named &quot;Kiki de Montparnasse&quot;.

On 14 May 2022, &quot;Le Violon d&#x27;Ingres&quot;, which depicts Prin&#x27;s back overlaid with a violin&#x27;s f-holes, sold for $12.4 million, setting a record as the most expensive photograph ever sold at auction.

<doc id="75210" wikidata="Q634199" url="?curid=75210" title="Bottom (TV series)">
<text>Bottom is a British sitcom created by Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson that ran for three series on BBC2 from 1991 to 1995. It focuses on Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Richard (Mayall) and Edward Elizabeth &quot;Eddie&quot; Hitler (Edmondson), two unemployed, crude, and perverted flatmates living in Hammersmith, London, who aspire to better themselves. &quot;Bottom&quot; became known for its chaotic, nihilistic humour and violent slapstick comedy. In 2004, &quot;Bottom&quot; was ranked 45th in a BBC poll for &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom&quot;.

Mayall and Edmondson had worked together since the mid-1970s, and developed &quot;Bottom&quot; as an extension of their own relationship and their on-screen characters in &quot;The Young Ones&quot; and &quot;Filthy Rich &amp; Catflap&quot;, their earlier BBC sitcoms. In addition to the series, the pair completed five stage show tours between 1993 and 2003, and adapted the sitcom into a feature-length film, &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot;, released in 1999. A proposed spin-off series featuring various &quot;Bottom&quot; characters, &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, was cancelled in 2013 before production. Mayall&#x27;s death in the following year ended plans for a revival.

==Cast==
Main characters
*Adrian Edmondson as Edward &quot;Eddie&quot; Elizabeth Hitler. Edmondson described Eddie as &quot;a very strange kind of mellow&quot; version of Vyvyan from &quot;The Young Ones&quot;. He is &quot;a man with no morals and a devious tiny-time entrepreneur&quot;.
*Rik Mayall as Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Richard. He is &quot;an old-fashioned moralist, hypocrite and small-minded virgin&quot;.

Recurring characters
*Steven O&#x27;Donnell as Spudgun (1991–1995)
*Christopher Ryan as Dave Hedgehog (1991–1995)
*Lee Cornes as Dick Head (1991–1995)
*Roger Sloman as Mr Harrison (1991–1992)

==Premise==
Eddie and Richie are two pathetic, sex-crazed, slobby flatmates living in a filthy, damp flat at 11 Mafeking Parade in Hammersmith, London. Mayall described them as &quot;unemployed survivors&quot;. They spend their time concocting desperate schemes to convince women to have sex with them, including buying sex spray, forging money, and pretending to be aristocrats. Their plans are never successful, however, and the stress of their miserable lives can cause them to become irritable with each other. Whenever tensions hit a breaking point, Richie and Eddie end up fighting (albeit in a comical, Tom and Jerry-style, with adult themes). Both men are immature. Richie is a virgin; he is insecure and clueless on how to talk to women. Despite being a penniless slob, he occasionally projects a pompous sort of snobbery in an attempt to impress others and boost his self-esteem; he is sexually frustrated and obsessed with losing his virginity. Eddie, the more popular of the two, enjoys drinking regularly, and often secretly steals family heirlooms and cash from Richie, although he occasionally has inventive moments, like building a cash forger, an electric toilet, and a time machine. Eddie&#x27;s friends, the gormless Spudgun and Dave Hedgehog, both fear Richie, believing him to be psychotic. Although the four of them sometimes venture out, usually to the local pub, the Lamb and Flag, most of the episodes are set within the confines of the squalid flat.

==Music==
The opening and closing themes are cover versions of B. B. King&#x27;s &quot;BB&#x27;s Theme&quot; and The Mar-Keys&#x27; &quot;Last Night&quot;, respectively. Both themes and the episode bridge instrumentals are played by The Bum Notes, an ensemble featuring Edmondson.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Mayall and Edmondson first met as drama students at Manchester University in 1975, when Edmondson joined the improvisational comedy troupe 20th Century Coyote, of which Mayall was a member. The act grew in popularity following successful runs at the Edinburgh Fringe and the Comic Strip in London, which led to the pair starring in the stage and television double act The Dangerous Brothers and sitcoms &quot;The Young Ones&quot; and &quot;Filthy, Rich &amp; Catflap&quot;. After the latter ended in 1987, the pair &quot;drifted away&quot; for a period before reuniting after they caught the attention of producer and executive Paul Jackson, who had also worked on &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, and pitched initial ideas they had for a new sitcom. Jackson was interested enough, and Mayall and Edmondson proceeded to write a draft script. Episodes were developed around improvisational writing, and Mayall recalled Edmondson &quot;did the typing and he allowed me to go to the off licence to buy all the drinks.&quot; Upon delivering their scripts, the BBC expressed concern that the show could not sustain itself with two characters alone, to which Mayall and Edmondson used Tony Hancock and Sid James as an example, and got their way. Mayall said that the BBC was too focused on the show&#x27;s content being &quot;morally sound and politically correct&quot;, but gave the green-light on the series.

The show&#x27;s original working title was &quot;Your Bottom&quot;, for the humour of people having to say &quot;I saw &#x27;Your Bottom&#x27; on television last night&quot;, before it was shortened because Mayall said they &quot;liked the shape of the word.&quot; It started as a joke until they learned that Alan Yentob, then head of BBC2, disliked the title which convinced the pair to stick with it. Mayall added that the title was deliberate to make viewers think of &quot;bottom jokes&quot;, but that it also reflects on the show&#x27;s premise of &quot;two guys at the bottom of the heap&quot;. Mayall and Edmondson were aware of the failures of other sitcoms, and purposely wrote tight scripts. Edmondson said writing &quot;Bottom&quot; was liberating &quot;because it&#x27;s obvious what the idea is – to be as funny as possible.&quot; The pair based Eddie and Richie on characters that they had improvised with as part of 20th Century Coyote, and on their own friendship. They made a conscious effort to avoid any pop culture or contemporary references when writing, as &quot;The Young Ones&quot; had been popular with young people and instead wanted to portray characters who had left student life behind and reached their &quot;thirties and forties&quot;. Instead, the two were interested in more everyday scenarios &quot;that have always been there&quot;, such as a gas meter reading. Eddie and Richie have been compared to their characters on &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, but 10 years older. After the first series had been recorded, Mayall ranked &quot;Bottom&quot; as their best work and marked &quot;a new chapter&quot; in his relationship with Edmondson.

In June 1990, a pilot episode was recorded which was later titled &quot;Contest&quot; and broadcast as part of the first series. Problems over content came to light when recording began. Mayall recalled they were allowed three &quot;bloodies&quot; or &quot;bloody hell&quot;s per episode, and arguments were often had with as many as 20 BBC executives who went on the set. Some executives criticised the series for being sexist, but Mayall pointed out that they would have had more women on the show if they had not cut around twenty &quot;shagging scenes&quot; that were written, and argued that lesbian scenes were also removed. After the first series was recorded in June and July 1991, &quot;Bottom&quot; was first announced in August, when the BBC reported that it had commissioned over 400 hours of new television programming for the upcoming autumn series. This included new productions from comics known as the Comic Strip in an attempt to attract viewers, with Mayall and Edmondson for &quot;Bottom&quot; and Dawn French for &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;.

&quot;Bottom&quot; ended after three series in February 1995. Edmondson said that one of the reasons for stopping the show was the struggle to come up with new ideas as &quot;we&#x27;d already hit each other with everything in the flat&quot;. Mayall supported this view, saying they took the show as far as it could go on television while continuing the franchise with stage tours and home video releases, preferring to retain full creative control over the characters. In 2000, he said that Richie and Eddie had become &quot;bigger than we are&quot;.

=== Recording ===
Each episode was recorded in front of a live audience. The original scripts can be found in the published script books, and several completely removed scenes were included in the VHS release &quot;Fluff&quot; that consisted mostly of bloopers. Several (but not all) of these scenes, as well as some smaller sections of dialogue also removed for timing reasons, are included in DVD releases.

The final episode of the second series, &#x27;s Out&quot;, was set on Wimbledon Common involving the antics of a flasher. It was not broadcast as part of the original series after Rachel Nickell was murdered on Wimbledon Common, due to which the BBC delayed its broadcast until a rerun of the second series on 10 April 1995.

== Spin-offs ==
=== Stage shows ===
Mayall and Edmondson held five nationwide theatre tours of &quot;Bottom&quot; between 1993 and 2003, adapting the original series into a stage show. The first tour, &quot;Bottom Live&quot;, lasted 43 dates across 10 weeks in 1993. The 2001 tour consisted of 76 dates, which included a show at the National Arena in Birmingham to over 4,500 people. The Weapons Grade Y-Fronts Tour included 40 dates. The stage shows were often cruder than the sitcom with stronger language, and developed over time to include settings outside the flat, including a prison cell and a remote island. There were several instances of the pair getting carried away with the planned stunts, resulting in one of them getting cuts on their head. Edmondson said: &quot;Rik would tell them &#x27;Don&#x27;t be scared, it happens all the time.&#x27; We&#x27;d just carry on, then go off to hospital afterwards to be sewn up.&quot; A show from each tour was recorded and released for home video.

=== &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot; ===

During the &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Island&quot; tour in 1997, Mayall and Edmondson sought ways of spending time before the night&#x27;s performance and began to develop ideas for a script that involved Richie being a hotel manager. After some time the pair realised that they had produced a substantial work that would suit a feature film. The result was &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot;, a spin-off to &quot;Bottom&quot; featuring Mayall and Edmondson as Richard Twat (pronounced &quot;Thwaite&quot;) and Eddie Elizabeth Ndingobamba, respectively, with Edmondson as director. The story involves the pair operating a grotty remote guesthouse next to a nuclear power plant and feeding their guests radioactive fish, causing massive amounts of vomiting. Despite the characters and humour being in the same vein as &quot;Bottom&quot;, Mayall said &quot;Guest House Paradiso&quot; was never meant to be a film version of &quot;Bottom&quot; because other sitcoms that had film adaptations &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot;. Produced on a £3 million budget, the film premiered in December 1999.

==Cancelled revivals==
In late 2004, surrounding the release of their &quot;Mindless Violence&quot; DVD, Mayall hinted that he and Edmondson may possibly be returning with another tour in the future. However, Edmondson said that it was &quot;definitely time to stop. We&#x27;re both getting too old. We both realised that the show wasn&#x27;t as engaging as it used to be. We were starting to look a bit ridiculous. ... We&#x27;re both nearly fifty and we&#x27;re starting to feel slightly undignified talking about wanking and knobs constantly.&quot; In 2010, Edmondson confirmed that he had quit comedy, stating that his interest in it has declined for many years, and wanted to focus more on his band. He dismissed the idea of reuniting with Mayall, saying it is &quot;very unlikely&quot;.

In March 2011, the duo made a surprise reunion when Edmondson took part in &quot;Let&#x27;s Dance for Comic Relief&quot;. A pre-recorded segment ended with Mayall hurling a custard pie in Edmondson&#x27;s face. Mayall appeared again, this time live on stage, to abruptly end Edmondson&#x27;s performance by hitting him several times with a frying pan. In the final, Mayall returned once again to drop a ton weight upon Edmondson. In the following month, Edmondson revealed that he and Mayall had conceived an idea for a sitcom. &quot;Rik and I have an idea for a sitcom for when we are very, very old. We want to set it in an old people&#x27;s home 30 years hence. It will be like &#x27;Bottom&#x27;, but we will be hitting each other with colostomy bags!&quot;

In August 2012, the BBC announced that it had commissioned a series based on the &quot;Hooligan&#x27;s Island&quot; stage show, where Eddie and Richie cause havoc on a deserted tropical island, set to air in 2013. However, the show was scrapped just two months later. Edmondson said &quot;it wasn&#x27;t working&quot; and wanted to pursue other projects. Mayall tried to have Edmondson reconsider, but he &quot;put his foot down and said, &#x27;It&#x27;s not going to work mate.&#x27;&quot;, and wanted to wait ten years until they were older for a possible sitcom set in an old peoples home. Mayall died on 9 June 2014, putting an end to the plans. In 2023, Edmondson revealed that he wrote the initial scripts with Mayall in the hope that the BBC would reject them. He felt Mayall was eager to revive their old characters, but struggled to accept that Edmondson was not interested. While he hoped a rejection would put Mayall&#x27;s aspirations to rest, the idea was ultimately greenlit.

==&quot;Bottom: Exposed&quot;==
In February 2024, pay television channel Gold announced &quot;Bottom: Exposed&quot;, a 2-hour documentary on the making of the sitcom, featuring exclusive behind the scenes footage and insights from Edmondson, Paul Jackson, director/producer Ed Bye, the cast and production crew, and celebrity fans. Narrated by Stephen Fry, it aired on 18 April 2024. On the following day, Gold aired extended versions of two episodes, &quot;Holy&quot; and &quot;Digger&quot;, for the first time on television. Both were previously released, the former on the series two DVD and the latter on the 1996 outtakes video &quot;Bottom Fluff&quot;.

==Episodes==
Many of the episodes&#x27; names are meant to be a humorous suffix to the word &quot;bottom&quot;. Bottom &quot;Fluff&quot; was used for the outtakes for the home video releases.

<text>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is a satirical novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott, first published in 1884 by Seeley &amp; Co. of London. Written pseudonymously by &quot;A Square&quot;, the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella&#x27;s more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions.

A sequel, &quot;Sphereland&quot;, was written by Dionys Burger in 1957. Several films have been based on &quot;Flatland&quot;, including the feature film &quot;Flatland&quot; (2007). Other efforts have been short or experimental films, including one narrated by Dudley Moore and the short films &quot;Flatland: The Movie&quot; (2007) and &quot;Flatland 2: Sphereland&quot; (2012).

== Plot ==
The story describes a two-dimensional world inhabited by geometric figures (flatlanders); women are line segments, while men are polygons with various numbers of sides. The narrator is a square, a member of the caste of gentlemen and professionals, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The first half of the story goes through the practicalities of existing in a two-dimensional universe, as well as a history leading up to the year 1999 on the eve of the 3rd Millennium.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, the Square dreams of a visit to a one-dimensional world, &quot;Lineland&quot;, inhabited by men, who are lines, while the women are &quot;lustrous points&quot;. These points and lines are unable to see the Square as anything other than a set of points on a line. Thus, the Square attempts to convince the realm&#x27;s monarch of a second dimension but cannot do so. In the end, the monarch of Lineland tries to kill the Square rather than tolerate him any further.

Following this vision, the Square is visited by a sphere. Similar to the &quot;points&quot; in Lineland, he is unable to see the three-dimensional object as anything other than a circle (more precisely, a disk). The Sphere then levitates up and down through Flatland, allowing the Square to see the circle expand and contract between great circle and small circles. The Sphere then tries further to convince the Square of the third dimension by dimensional analogies (a point becomes a line, a line becomes a square). The Square is still unable to comprehend the third dimension, so the Sphere resorts to deeds: he gives info about the &quot;insides&quot; of the house, moves a cup through the third dimension, and even goes inside the Square for a bit. Still unable to comprehend 3D, the Sphere takes the Square to the third dimension, Spaceland. This Sphere visits Flatland at the turn of each millennium to introduce a new apostle to the idea of a third dimension in the hope of eventually educating the population of Flatland. From the safety of Spaceland, they can oversee the leaders of Flatland, acknowledging the Sphere&#x27;s existence and prescribing the silencing. After this proclamation is made, many witnesses are massacred or imprisoned (according to caste), including the Square&#x27;s brother.

After the Square&#x27;s mind is opened to new dimensions, he tries to convince the Sphere of the theoretical possibility of the existence of a fourth dimension and higher spatial dimensions. Still, the Sphere returns his student to Flatland in disgrace.

The Square then has a dream in which the Sphere revisits him, this time to introduce him to a zero-dimensional space, Pointland, of whom the Point (sole inhabitant, monarch, and universe in one) perceives any communication as a thought originating in his own mind (cf. Solipsism):

The Square recognises the identity of the ignorance of the monarchs of Pointland and Lineland with his own (and the Sphere&#x27;s) previous ignorance of the existence of higher dimensions. Once returned to Flatland, the Square cannot convince anyone of Spaceland&#x27;s existence, especially after official decrees are announced that anyone preaching the existence of three dimensions will be imprisoned (or executed, depending on caste). For example, he tries to convince his relative of the third dimension but cannot move a square &quot;upward,&quot; as opposed to forward or sideways. Eventually, the Square himself is imprisoned for just this reason, with only occasional contact with his brother, who is imprisoned in the same facility. He cannot convince his brother, even after all they have both seen. Seven years after being imprisoned, A Square writes out the book &quot;Flatland&quot; as a memoir, hoping to keep it as posterity for a future generation that can see beyond their two-dimensional existence.

==Social elements==
Men are portrayed as polygons whose social status is determined by their regularity and the number of their sides, with a Circle considered the &quot;perfect&quot; shape. Women are lines, quite fragile but also dangerous, as they can disappear from view and possibly stab someone. To prevent this, they are required by law to sound a &quot;peace-cry&quot; while moving about and to use separate doors from men.

In the world of Flatland, classes are distinguished by the &quot;Art of Hearing&quot;, the &quot;Art of Feeling&quot;, and the &quot;Art of Sight Recognition&quot;. Classes can be distinguished by the sound of one&#x27;s voice, but the lower classes have more developed vocal organs, enabling them to feign the voice of a Polygon or even a Circle. Feeling, practised by the lower classes and women, determines the configuration of a person by feeling one of its angles. The &quot;Art of Sight Recognition&quot;, practised by the upper classes, is aided by &quot;Fog&quot;, which allows an observer to determine the depth of an object. With this, polygons with sharp angles relative to the observer will fade more rapidly than polygons with more gradual angles. Colour of any kind was banned in Flatland after Isosceles workers painted themselves to impersonate noble Polygons. The Square describes these events, and the ensuing class war at length.

The population of Flatland can &quot;evolve&quot; through the &quot;Law of Nature&quot;, which states: &quot;a male child shall have one more side than his father, so that each generation shall rise (as a rule) one step in the scale of development and nobility. Thus the son of a Square is a Pentagon, the son of a Pentagon, a Hexagon; and so on&quot;.

This rule is not the case when dealing with Isosceles Triangles (Soldiers and Workmen) with only two congruent sides. The smallest angle of an Isosceles Triangle gains 30 arc minutes (half a degree) each generation. Additionally, the rule does not seem to apply to many-sided Polygons. For example, the sons of several hundred-sided Polygons will often develop 50 or more sides more than their parents. Furthermore, the angle of an Isosceles Triangle or the number of sides of a (regular) Polygon may be altered during life by deeds or surgical adjustments.

An Equilateral Triangle is a member of the craftsman class. Squares and Pentagons are the &quot;gentlemen&quot; class, as doctors, lawyers, and other professions. Hexagons are the lowest rank of nobility, all the way up to (near) Circles, who make up the priest class. The higher-order Polygons have much less of a chance of producing sons, preventing Flatland from being overcrowded with noblemen.

Apart from Isosceles Triangles, only regular Polygons are considered until chapter seven of the book when the issue of irregularity, or physical deformity is brought up. In a two-dimensional world, a regular polygon can be identified by a single angle and/or vertex. To maintain social cohesion, irregularity is to be abhorred, with moral irregularity and criminality cited, &quot;by some&quot; (in the book), as inevitable additional deformities, a sentiment with which the Square concurs. If the error of deviation is above a stated amount, the irregular Polygon faces euthanasia; if below, he becomes the lowest rank of civil servant. An irregular Polygon is not destroyed at birth, but allowed to develop to see if the irregularity can be &quot;cured&quot; or reduced. If the deformity remains, the irregular is &quot;painlessly and mercifully consumed.&quot;

==As social satire==
In &quot;Flatland&quot;, Abbott describes a society rigidly divided into classes. Social ascent is the main aspiration of its inhabitants, apparently granted to everyone but strictly controlled by the top of the hierarchy. Freedom is despised and the laws are cruel. Innovators are imprisoned or suppressed. Members of lower classes who are intellectually valuable, and potential leaders of riots, are either killed or promoted to the higher classes. Every attempt for change is considered dangerous and harmful. This world is not prepared to receive &quot;revelations from another world&quot;. The satirical part is mainly concentrated in the first part of the book, &quot;This World&quot;, which describes Flatland. The main points of interest are the Victorian concept of women&#x27;s roles in the society and in the class-based hierarchy of men. Abbott has been accused of misogyny due to his portrayal of women in &quot;Flatland&quot;. In his Preface to the Second and Revised Edition, 1884, he answers such critics by emphasizing that the description of women was satirizing the viewpoints held, stating that the Square: 

==Critical reception==
&quot;Flatland&quot; did not have much success when published, although it was not entirely ignored. In the entry on Edwin Abbott in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; for persons who died in the period of 1922 to 1930, &quot;Flatland&quot; was not even mentioned.

The book was discovered again after Albert Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity was published, which brought to prominence the concept of a fourth dimension. &quot;Flatland&quot; was mentioned in a letter by William Garnett entitled &quot;Euclid, Newton and Einstein&quot; published in &quot;Nature&quot; on 12 February 1920. In this letter, Abbott is depicted, in a sense, as a prophet due to his intuition of the importance of &quot;time&quot; to explain certain phenomena:

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; subsequently revised his biography to state that [Abbott] &quot;is most remembered as the author of &quot;Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions&quot;.

==Adaptations and parodies==
Numerous imitations or sequels to &quot;Flatland&quot; have been created. Examples include:

; Films and TV

* &quot;Flatland&quot; (1965), an animated short film based on the novella, was directed by Eric Martin and based on an idea by John Hubley.
* &quot;Flatlandia&quot; (1982), an Italian stop motion animated short film, directed by Michele Emmer.
* &quot;Flatland&quot; (2007), a 95-minute animated independent feature film version directed by Ladd Ehlinger Jr., updates the satire from Victorian England to the modern-day United States.
* &quot;Flatland: The Movie&quot; (2007), by Dano Johnson and Jeffrey Travis, is a 34-minute animated educational film. Its sequel was &quot;Flatland 2: Sphereland&quot; (2012), inspired by the novel &quot;Sphereland&quot; by Dionys Burger.

; Literature

Books and short stories inspired by &quot;Flatland&quot; include:

* &quot;An Episode on Flatland: Or How a Plain Folk Discovered the Third Dimension&quot; by Charles Howard Hinton (1907)
* &quot;The Dot and the Line: A Romance in Lower Mathematics&quot; by Norton Juster (1963)
* &quot;Sphereland&quot; by Dionys Burger (1965)
* &quot;The Incredible Umbrella&quot; by Marvin Kaye (1980)
* &quot;Message Found in a Copy of &quot;Flatland&quot;&quot; by Rudy Rucker (1983)
* &quot;The Planiverse&quot; by A. K. Dewdney (1984)
* &quot;Flatterland&quot; by Ian Stewart (2001)
* &quot;Spaceland&quot; by Rudy Rucker (2002)
* &quot;&quot; (2002) by Steve Tomasula, which uses the two-dimensional world to critique contemporary society

==In popular culture==
* Physicists and science popularizers Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking have both commented on and postulated about the effects of &quot;Flatland&quot;. Sagan recreates the thought experiment as a set-up to discussing the possibilities of higher dimensions of the physical universe in both the book and , whereas Hawking notes the peculiarity of life in two-dimensional space, as any inhabitants would necessarily be unable to digest their own food. (This concept is parodied in the below-described episode of &quot;Futurama&quot;. The protagonists attempt to eat Flatland food but it falls out immediately. The native organisms in Flatland absorb food somewhat like amoeba.)
* In the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Loss&quot;, the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D becomes trapped within a field of two-dimensional lifeforms.
*&quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume 2&quot;, issue 3, in chapter 3 of the series of writings &quot;New Traveller&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, it is mentioned that in an unknown basement of New York, Flatland was discovered by a mathematician.
* In the &quot;2-D Blacktop&quot; episode of the animated science fiction TV comedy series &quot;Futurama&quot; (season 10 episode 1, originally broadcast June 17, 2013), two spaceships moving at relativistic speeds crash head on and are compressed together into a flat disk. They meet natives of the realm, who chase after them when the concept of a third dimension is brought up.
* In David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (1996), it is briefly mentioned that students from the Enfield Tennis Academy could be seen studying and highlighting copies of &quot;Flatland&quot; on the bus.
* &quot;Flatland&quot; features in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; episode &quot;The Psychic Vortex&quot;, when Sheldon Cooper declares it one of his favourite imaginary places to visit.
* On the series &quot;The Orville&quot;, episode &quot;New Dimensions&quot;, after entering a region of two-dimensional space Captain Ed Mercer references Flatland and its theme of social hierarchy.
* In the &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; episode &quot;Straw&quot;, Clay Morrow is lounging on a cot in a private cell in county jail when he first meets retired U.S. Marshal Lee Toric. Morrow half-ignores Toric while keeping his eyes on a copy of &quot;Flatland&quot;.
* In &quot;Gravity Falls,&quot; it is implied by the main antagonist Bill Cipher that he originates from a dimension very similar to Flatland.
* In the Gravity Falls book titled &quot;The Book of Bill&quot; a picture of Flatland&#x27;s cover is shown on a TV screen on the chapter titled &quot;My Story&quot;.
*The novel appears in the film &quot;Interstellar&quot;.
*In the 1964 episode of Outer Limits “Behold Eck!” a 2-dimensional creature accidentally visits earth through a time-hole and causes some damage before it can get back home.

<text>The electric chair is a specialized device used for capital punishment through electrocution. The condemned is strapped to a custom wooden chair and electrocuted via electrodes attached to the head and leg. Alfred P. Southwick, a Buffalo, New York dentist, conceived this execution method in 1881. It was developed over the next decade as a more humane alternative to conventional executions, particularly hanging. First used in 1890, the electric chair became symbolic of this execution method.

Closely linked to capital punishment in the United States, the electric chair was also used extensively in the Philippines. It was initially thought to cause death through cerebral damage, but it was scientifically established in 1899 that death primarily results from ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.
Despite its historical significance in American capital punishment, electric chair use has declined with the adoption of lethal injection which was perceived as more humane. While some states retain electrocution as a legal execution method, it is often a secondary option based on the condemned&#x27;s preference. Exceptions include South Carolina, where it is the primary method, and Tennessee, where it can be used without prisoner input if lethal injection drugs are unavailable.

As of 2024, electrocution remains an option in states like Alabama, South Carolina and Florida, where inmates may choose lethal injection instead. Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee offer the electric chair to those sentenced before a certain date. Inmates not selecting this method or convicted after the specified date face lethal injection. Arkansas currently has no death row inmates sentenced before their select date. These three states also authorize electrocution as an alternative if lethal injection is deemed unconstitutional.

The electric chair remains an accepted alternative in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma if other execution methods are ruled unconstitutional at the time of execution. A significant shift occurred on February 8, 2008, when the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled electric chair execution as &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; under the state constitution. This decision ended electric chair executions in Nebraska, the last state to rely solely on this method.

== Background ==
===Invention===
In the late 1870s to early 1880s, the spread of arc lighting, a type of outdoor street lighting that required high voltages in the range of 3000–6000 volts, was followed by one story after another in newspapers about how the high voltages used were killing people, usually unwary linemen; it was a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead without leaving a mark. One of these accidents, in Buffalo, New York, on August 7, 1881, led to the inception of the electric chair. That evening a drunken dock worker named George Lemuel Smith, looking for the thrill of a tingling sensation he had noticed when grabbing the guard rail in a Brush Electric Company arc lighting power house, managed to sneak his way back into the plant at night and grabbed the brush and ground of a large electric dynamo. He died instantly. The coroner who investigated the case brought it up that year at a local Buffalo scientific society. Another member attending that lecture, Alfred P. Southwick, a dentist who had a technical background, thought some application could be found for the curious phenomenon.

Southwick joined physician George E. Fell and the head of the Buffalo ASPCA in a series of experiments electrocuting hundreds of stray dogs. They ran trials with the dog in water and out of water, and varied the electrode type and placement until they came up with a repeatable method to euthanize animals using electricity. Southwick went on in the early 1880s to advocate that this method be used as a more humane replacement for hanging in capital cases, coming to national attention when he published his ideas in scientific journals in 1882 and 1883. He worked out calculations based on the dog experiments, trying to develop a scaled-up method that would work on humans. Early on in his designs he adopted a modified version of the dental chair as a way to restrain the condemned, a device that from then on would be called the &quot;electric chair&quot;.

====Gerry Commission====
After a series of botched hangings in the United States, there was mounting criticism of that form of capital punishment and the death penalty in general. In 1886, newly elected New York State governor David B. Hill set up a three-member death penalty commission, which was chaired by the human rights advocate and reformer Elbridge Thomas Gerry and included New York lawyer and politician Matthew Hale and Southwick, to investigate a more humane means of execution.
The commission members surveyed the history of execution and sent out a fact-finding questionnaire to government officials, lawyers, and medical experts all around the state asking for their opinion. A slight majority of respondents recommended hanging over electrocution, with a few instead recommending the abolition of capital punishment. The commission also contacted electrical experts, including Thomson-Houston Electric Company&#x27;s Elihu Thomson (who recommended high voltage AC connected to the head and the spine) and the inventor Thomas Edison (who also recommended AC, as well as using a Westinghouse generator). They also attended electrocutions of dogs by George Fell who had worked with Southwick in the early 1880s experiments. Fell was conducting further experiments, electrocuting anesthetized vivisected dogs trying to discern exactly how electricity killed a subject.

In 1888, the Commission recommended electrocution using Southwick&#x27;s electric chair idea with metal conductors attached to the condemned person&#x27;s head and feet. They further recommended that executions be handled by the state instead of the individual counties with three electric chairs set up at Auburn, Clinton, and Sing Sing prisons. A bill following these recommendations passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Hill on June 4, 1888, set to go into effect on January 1, 1889.

====New York Medico-Legal Commission====
The bill itself contained no details on the type or amount of electricity that should be used and the New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of determining these factors. In September 1888, a committee was formed and recommended 3000 volts, although the type of electricity, direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC), was not determined, and since tests up to that point had been done on animals smaller than a human (dogs), some members were unsure that the lethality of AC had been conclusively proven.

At this point, the state&#x27;s efforts to design the electric chair became intermixed with what has come to be known as the war of the currents, a competition between Thomas Edison&#x27;s direct current power system and George Westinghouse&#x27;s alternating current based system. The two companies had been competing commercially since 1886 and a series of events had turned it into an all-out media war in 1888. The committee head, neurologist Frederick Peterson, enlisted the services of Harold P. Brown as a consultant. Brown had been on his own crusade against alternating current after the shoddy installation of pole-mounted AC arc lighting lines in New York City had caused several deaths in early 1888. Peterson had been an assistant at Brown&#x27;s July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College, an attempt by Brown to prove AC was more deadly than DC. Technical assistance in these demonstrations was provided by Thomas Edison&#x27;s West Orange laboratory and there grew to be some form of collusion between Edison Electric and Brown. Back at West Orange on December 5, 1888, Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society including Elbridge Gerry who was also chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC. Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society recommended the use of 1000–1500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities. Westinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current and accused Brown of being in the employ of Edison.

At the request of death penalty commission chairman Gerry, Medico-Legal Society members; electrotherapy expert Alphonse David Rockwell, Carlos Frederick MacDonald, and Columbia College professor Louis H. Laudy, were given the task of working out the details of electrode placement. They again turned to Brown to supply the technical assistance. Brown asked Edison Electric Light to supply equipment for the tests and treasurer Francis S. Hastings (who seemed to be one of the primary movers at the company trying to portray Westinghouse as a peddler of death dealing AC current) tried to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test but found none could be acquired. They ended up using Edison&#x27;s West Orange laboratory for the animal tests they conducted in mid-March 1889. Superintendent of Prisons Austin E. Lathrop asked Brown to design the chair, but Brown turned down the offer. George Fell drew up the final designs for a simple oak chair and went against the Medico-Legal Society recommendations, changing the position of the electrodes to the head and the middle of the back. Brown did take on the job of finding the generators needed to power the chair. He managed to surreptitiously acquire three Westinghouse AC generators that were being decommissioned with the help of Edison and Westinghouse&#x27;s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, a move that made sure that Westinghouse&#x27;s equipment would be associated with the first execution. The electric chair was built by Edwin F. Davis, the first &quot;state electrician&quot; (executioner) for the State of New York.

===First execution===

The first person in line to die under New York&#x27;s new electrocution law was Joseph Chapleau, convicted for beating his neighbor to death with a sled stake, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. The next person scheduled to be executed was William Kemmler, convicted of murdering his wife with a hatchet. An appeal on Kemmler&#x27;s behalf was made to the New York Court of Appeals on the grounds that use of electricity as a means of execution constituted a &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; and was thus contrary to the constitutions of the United States and the state of New York. On December 30, 1889, the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; sworn out on Kemmler&#x27;s behalf was denied by the court, with Judge Dwight writing in a lengthy ruling:

We have no doubt that if the Legislature of this State should undertake to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; it is a question of fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.

Kemmler was executed in New York&#x27;s Auburn Prison on August 6, 1890; the &quot;state electrician&quot; was Edwin Davis. The first 17-second passage of 1,000 volts AC through Kemmler caused unconsciousness, but failed to stop his heart and breathing. The attending physicians, Edward Charles Spitzka and Carlos Frederick MacDonald, came forward to examine Kemmler. After confirming Kemmler was still alive, Spitzka reportedly called out, &quot;Have the current turned on again, quick, no delay.&quot; The generator needed time to re-charge, however. In the second attempt, Kemmler received a 2,000 volt AC shock. Blood vessels under the skin ruptured and bled, and the areas around the electrodes singed; some witnesses reported that his body caught fire. The entire execution took about eight minutes. George Westinghouse later commented that, &quot;They would have done better using an axe&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran the headline: &quot;Far worse than hanging&quot;.

===Adoption===
The electric chair was adopted by Ohio (1897), Massachusetts (1900), New Jersey (1906), and Virginia (1908), and soon became the prevalent method of execution in the United States, replacing hanging. Twenty-six states, the District of Columbia, the federal government, and the U.S. military either had death by electrocution on the books or actively executed criminals using the method. The electric chair remained the most prominent execution method until the early 21st century, when lethal injection became a method an inmate could choose in several states, but rarely used.

Other countries appear to have contemplated using the method, sometimes for special reasons. The Philippines also adopted the electric chair from 1926 to 1987. A well-publicized triple execution took place there in May 1972, when Jaime Jose, Basilio Pineda, and Edgardo Aquino were electrocuted for the 1967 abduction and gang-rape of the young actress Maggie de la Riva. The last electric chair execution in the Philippines was in 1976 and was later replaced with lethal injection when executions resumed in that country.

===Key events in the United States===
Martha M. Place became the first woman executed in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison on March 20, 1899, for the murder of her 17-year-old stepdaughter, Ida Place.
Leon Czolgosz was executed in the electric chair at New York&#x27;s Auburn Prison on October 29, 1901, for the assassination of then-President William McKinley.

The first photograph of an execution by electric chair was of housewife Ruth Snyder at Sing Sing on the evening of January 12, 1928, for the March 1927 murder of her husband. It was photographed for a front-page story in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; the following morning by news photographer Tom Howard who had smuggled a camera into the death chamber and photographed her in the electric chair as the current was turned on. It remains one of the best-known examples of photojournalism.

A record was set on July 13, 1928, when seven men were executed consecutively in the electric chair at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville, Kentucky.

On June 16, 1944, an African-American teenager, 14-year-old George Stinney, became the youngest person ever executed in the electric chair when he was electrocuted at the Central Correctional Institution in Columbia, South Carolina. His conviction was overturned in 2014 after a circuit court judge vacated his sentence on the grounds that Stinney did not receive a fair trial. The judge determined that Stinney&#x27;s legal counsel was inadequate, thus violating his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

On May 3, 1946, an African-American teenager named Willie Francis became the first person known to have survived the electric chair in the Louisiana State Penitentiary in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. His appeals to the death penalty failed, and was executed again on May 9, 1947, at age 18. His trial has claimed to be unfair, which the trial also violated his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteen Amendment rights to the U.S. Constitution.

On May 25, 1979, in Florida, John Spenkelink became the first person to be electrocuted after the &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1976. He was the first person to be executed in the United States in this manner since 1966.

The last person to be executed by electric chair without the choice of an alternative method was Lynda Lyon Block on May 10, 2002, in Alabama.

The most recent execution by electric chair was of Nicholas Todd Sutton on February 20, 2020, in Tennessee.

==Process and mechanism==

The condemned inmate&#x27;s head and legs are shaved and they are seated in the chair. Their arms and legs are tightly strapped with leather belts, and a cap with a saltwater-soaked sponge is strapped to the head, and electrodes are attached to the legs. The condemned person is optionally hooded or blindfolded.

Various cycles (changes in voltage and duration) of alternating current are passed through the individual&#x27;s body in order to cause lethal damage to the internal organs. The first, more powerful electric shock (between 2,000 and 2,500 volts) is intended to cause immediate unconsciousness, ventricular fibrillation, and eventual cardiac arrest. The second, less powerful electric shock (500–1,500 volts) is intended to cause lethal damage to the vital organs.

After the cycles are completed, a doctor checks the inmate for any signs of life. If none are present, the doctor reports and records the time of death, and prison officials will wait for the body to cool down before removing it to prepare for autopsy. If the inmate exhibits signs of life, the doctor notifies the warden, who usually will order another round of electric current or (rarely) postpone the execution such as with Willie Francis.

==Controversies and criticisms==
===Possibility of consciousness and pain during execution===
Critics of the electric chair dispute whether the first jolt of electricity reliably induces immediate unconsciousness as proponents often claim.

===Botched executions===
The electric chair has been criticized because of several instances in which the subjects were killed only after being subjected to multiple electric shocks. This led to a call for ending of the practice, as being a &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;. Trying to address such concerns, Nebraska introduced a new electrocution protocol in 2004, which called for the administration of a 15-second application of current at 2,450 volts; after a 15-minute wait, an official then checks for signs of life. In April 2007, new concerns raised regarding the 2004 protocol resulted in the ushering in of a different Nebraska protocol, calling for a 20-second application of current at 2,450 volts. Prior to the 2004 protocol change, an initial eight-second application of current at 2,450 volts was administered, followed by a one-second pause, then a 22-second application at 480 volts. After a 20-second break, the cycle was repeated three more times.

In 1946, the electric chair failed to kill Willie Francis, who reportedly shrieked, &quot;Take it off! Let me breathe!&quot;, after the current was applied. It turned out that the portable electric chair had been improperly set up by an intoxicated prison guard and inmate. A case was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court &quot;(Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber)&quot;, with lawyers for the condemned arguing that although Francis did not die, he had, in fact, been executed. The argument was rejected on the basis that re-execution did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the 5th Amendment of the United States Constitution, and Francis was returned to the electric chair and executed in 1947.

Florida saw three highly controversial botched electrocutions in the 1990s, starting with the 1990 execution of Jesse Tafero. His case generated significant controversy, as with the first administration of electricity, Tafero&#x27;s face and head caught fire. Tafero&#x27;s execution ultimately required three shocks over the course of seven minutes. The error was blamed on prison officials replacing Florida&#x27;s old natural sea sponge with a kitchen sponge. The 1997 execution of Pedro Medina in Florida created controversy when flames burst from his head. An autopsy found that Medina had died instantly when the first surge of electricity had destroyed his brain and brain stem. A judge ruled that the incident arose from &quot;unintentional human error&quot; rather than any faults in the &quot;apparatus, equipment, and electrical circuitry&quot; of Florida&#x27;s electric chair. In Florida, on July 8, 1999, Allen Lee Davis, convicted of murder, was executed in the Florida electric chair &quot;Old Sparky&quot;. Davis&#x27; face was bloodied, and photographs were taken, which were later posted on the Internet. An investigation concluded that Davis had begun bleeding before the electricity was applied and that the chair had functioned as intended. Florida&#x27;s Supreme Court ruled that the electric chair did not constitute &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;.

==Decline and current status==
The use of the electric chair has declined since the 1979 advent of lethal injection, which is now the default method in all U.S. jurisdictions that authorize capital punishment.

As of 2024, the only places that still reserve the electric chair as an option for execution are the U.S. states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, South Carolina and Tennessee. Electrocution is also authorized in Florida if lethal injection is found unconstitutional. Mississippi and Oklahoma laws provide for its use should lethal injection ever be held to be unconstitutional. Inmates in the other states must select either it or lethal injection. In Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, inmates sentenced before a certain date can choose to be executed by electric chair. Arkansas currently doesn&#x27;t have any death row inmates sentenced before their select date. Electrocution is also authorized in the three aforementioned states in case lethal injection is found unconstitutional by a court. In May 2014, Tennessee passed a law allowing the use of the electric chair if lethal injection drugs were unavailable.

On February 15, 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court declared execution by electrocution to be &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; prohibited by the Nebraska Constitution.

The last judicial electrocution in the U.S. prior to &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; took place in Oklahoma in 1966. The electric chair was used quite frequently in post-&quot;Gregg v Georgia&quot; executions during the 1980s, but its use in the United States gradually declined in the 1990s due to the widespread adoption of lethal injection. A number of states still allow the condemned person to choose between electrocution and lethal injection, with the most recent U.S. electrocution, of Nicholas Todd Sutton, taking place in February 2020 in Tennessee.

In 2021, South Carolina&#x27;s governor Henry McMaster passed a law making electrocution the primary form of execution, with the options of lethal injection or a firing squad being available if the condemned requests it within 14 and 28 days of his execution. In 2022, a judge in Richland County, declared that the firing squad and electrocution were both in violation of the South Carolina State Constitution, which bans methods that are &quot;cruel, unusual, or corporal.&quot; The court, in their decision, stated that there was no evidence that electrocution could instantaneously or painlessly kill an inmate, writing that the idea of the electric chair inducing instant unconsciousness was based on &quot;underlying assumptions upon which the electric chair is based, dating back to the 1800s, [that] have since been disproven.&quot; The decision also called electrocution &quot;inconsistent with both the concepts of evolving standards of decency and the dignity of man&quot;, and stated, &quot;Even if an inmate survived only fifteen or thirty seconds, he would suffer the experience of being burned alive—a punishment that has &#x27;long been recognized as manifestly cruel and unusual.&#x27;&quot; The ruling led to a permanent injunction being issued against both methods of execution, preventing the state from subjecting death row inmates to death by firing squad or electrocution. In July 2024, the Supreme Court of South Carolina ruled that electrocution and firing squad was legal. 

On March 5, 2024, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry signed a law reintroducing electrocution and also allowing executions to be carried out via nitrogen gas.

<text>Baltic Germans ( or , later ) are ethnic German inhabitants of the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea, in what today are Estonia and Latvia. Since their resettlement in 1945 after the end of World War II, Baltic Germans have markedly declined as a geographically determined ethnic group in the region. 

Since the late Middle Ages, native German-speakers formed the majority of merchants and clergy, and the large majority of the local landowning nobility who effectively constituted a ruling class over indigenous Latvian and Estonian non-nobles. By the time a distinct Baltic German ethnic identity began emerging in the 19th century, the majority of self-identifying Baltic Germans were non-nobles belonging mostly to the urban and professional middle class.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, Catholic German traders and crusaders (&quot;see &quot;) began settling in the eastern Baltic territories. With the decline of Latin, German became the dominant language of official documents, commerce, education and government. By the first half of the 20th century, the Baltic Germans were, until after World War II, along with the Transylvanian Saxons and the Zipser Germans (in Romania and Slovakia respectively), one of the three oldest continuously German-speaking and ethnic German groups of the German diaspora in Europe.

The majority of medieval Catholic settlers and their German-speaking descendants lived in the local towns of medieval Livonia. However, a small wealthy elite formed the Baltic nobility, acquiring large rural estates. When Sweden had ceded its Livonian territories to the Russian Empire after the Great Northern War (1700–1721), many of these German-speaking aristocrats began taking high positions in the military, political and civilian life of the Russian Empire, particularly in its capital city Saint Petersburg. Most Baltic Germans were citizens of the Russian Empire until Estonia and Latvia achieved independence in 1918. Thereafter, most Baltic Germans held Estonian or Latvian citizenship until their coerced resettlement to Nazi Germany in 1939, prior to the Soviet invasion and occupation of Estonia and Latvia in 1940.

The Baltic German population never surpassed more than 10% of the total population. In 1881, there were 180,000 Baltic Germans in Russia&#x27;s Baltic provinces; however, by 1914, this number had declined to 162,000. In 1881 there were approximately 46,700 Germans in Estonia (5.3% of the population). According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, there were 120,191 Germans in Latvia, or 6.2% of the population.

Baltic German presence in the Baltics came effectively close to an end in late 1939, following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the subsequent Nazi–Soviet population transfers. Nazi Germany resettled almost all the Baltic Germans under the program into the newly formed of and Danzig-West Prussia (on the territory of the occupied Second Polish Republic). In 1945, most ethnic Germans were expelled from these lands as part of the wider expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe after World War II. Resettlement was planned by the Allies for the territory remaining under Germany under terms of the border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, i.e. west of the Oder–Neisse line.

Ethnic Germans from East Prussia and Lithuania are sometimes incorrectly considered Baltic Germans for reasons of cultural, linguistic, and historical affinities. Germans of East Prussia held Prussian, and after 1871, German citizenship, because the territory they lived in was part of the Kingdom of Prussia.

==Ethnic composition==
Baltic Germans were not a purely German ethnic group. The early crusaders, tradesmen and craftsmen often married local women, as there were no German women available. Some noble families, such as the Lievens, claimed descent through such women from native chieftains. Many of the German Livonian-Order soldiers died during the Livonian War of 1558–1583. New German arrivals came to the area. During this time, the Low German (&quot;Plattdeutsch&quot;) of the original settlers was gradually replaced by the High German (&quot;Hochdeutsch&quot;) of the new settlers.

In the course of their 700-year history, Baltic German families had ethnic German roots, but also intermarried extensively with Estonians, Livonians and Latvians, as well as with other Northern or Central European peoples, such as Danes, Swedes, Irish, English, Scots, Poles, Hungarians and Dutch. In cases where intermarriage occurred, members of the other ethnic groups frequently assimilated into German culture, adopting German language, customs, and family names. They were then considered Germans, leading to the ethnogenesis of the Baltic Germans. The families of Barclay de Tolly and of George Armitstead (1847–1912), who had emigrated from the British Isles, married into and became part of the Baltic-German community.

==Territories==
Baltic German settlements in the Baltic area consisted of the following territories:
*&quot;Estland&quot; (; ), roughly the northern half of present-day Estonia; major towns: &quot;Reval&quot; (Tallinn), &quot;Narwa&quot; (Narva), &quot;Wesenberg&quot; (Rakvere), &quot;Weissenstein&quot; (Paide), &quot;Hapsal&quot; (Haapsalu).
*&quot;Livland&quot; (; ; ), roughly the southern half of present-day Estonia and the northern and eastern part of today&#x27;s Latvia (Vidzeme); major towns: Riga, &quot;Wenden&quot; (Cēsis), &quot;Wolmar&quot; (Valmiera), &quot;Walk&quot; (Valga and Valka), &quot;Dorpat&quot; (Tartu), &quot;Pernau&quot; (Pärnu), &quot;Fellin&quot; (Viljandi).
*&quot;Kurland&quot; (; also ; ), roughly the western half of present-day Latvia (Kurzeme and Zemgale); major towns: &quot;Mitau&quot; (Jelgava), &quot;Windau&quot; (Ventspils), &quot;Libau&quot; (Liepāja).
*&quot;Ösel&quot; (the island of Saaremaa) belonging to present-day Estonia; major town: &quot;Arensburg&quot; (Kuressaare).

==History==

===Conquering the Baltics===


Small numbers of ethnic Germans began to settle in the area in the late 12th century, when traders and Christian missionaries began to visit the coastal lands inhabited by tribes who spoke Finnic and Baltic languages. Systematic conquest and settlement of these lands was completed during the Northern Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries; this resulted in creation of the Terra Mariana confederation, under the protection of Roman Popes and Holy Roman Empire. After the heavy defeat in the 1236 Battle of Saule the Livonian Brothers of the Sword became a part of the Teutonic Order.

During the next three centuries, German-speaking soldiers, clergymen, merchants and craftsmen constituted the majority of the quickly growing urban population, as the native inhabitants usually were prohibited from settling there. In 1230, the Livonian Order invited over 200 German merchants from Gotland to settle in Tallinn where they founded a market town. Membership in the Hanseatic League and active trade links with Russia and Europe increased the wealth of German traders.

===Polish-Lithuanian and Swedish rule===
As the military power of the Teutonic Knights weakened during the 15th century wars with the Kingdom of Poland, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Grand Duchy of Moscow, the Livonian branch in the north began to pursue its own policies. When the Prussian branch of the Order secularized in 1525 and became a Polish vassal state as the Duchy of Prussia, the Livonian branch remained independent while searching for a similar way to secularize. Livonia became mostly Protestant during the Reformation.

In 1558, the Tsardom of Russia began the Livonian War against Terra Mariana which soon involved the Kingdoms of Poland, Sweden, and Denmark and lasted for 20 years. In 1561, Terra Mariana ceased to exist and was divided among Denmark (which took the island of Ösel), Sweden (which took northern Estonia) and Poland, which annexed the newly created Duchy of Livonia, and granted the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, a vassal state of Poland-Lithuania, to the last Master of the Livonian Order Gotthard Kettler. The secularized land was divided among the remaining knights who formed the basis of Baltic nobility.

The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia existed as a German-speaking country until 1795, while the northern part of Duchy of Livonia was conquered by Sweden which controlled parts of Estonia between 1561 and 1710 and Swedish Livonia between 1621 and 1710, having signed an agreement with the local Baltic German nobles not to undermine their political rights and autonomy.

The &quot;Academia Gustaviana&quot; (now University of Tartu) was founded in 1632 by King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden. It remained the only institution of higher education in the former Livonian territories and became the intellectual focus of the Baltic Germans.

At the end of the 17th century, Sweden introduced the land reduction in its Baltic provinces and properties held by German nobility became the property of the Crown. That effectively turned serfs into free peasants. However, it would be overturned when Russia conquered these territories in 1710 and restored the rights of German landowners under the Treaty of Nystad.

===Russia&#x27;s Baltic governorates (1710–1917)===



Between 1710 and 1795, following Russia&#x27;s success in the Great Northern War and the three Partitions of Poland, the areas inhabited by Baltic Germans eventually became Baltic governorates of the Russian Empire: Courland Governorate, Governorate of Livonia and Governorate of Estonia.

====Autonomy====

The Baltic provinces remained autonomous and were self-governed by the local Baltic nobility. Until the imperial reforms of the 1880s, local government was in the hands of the landtag of each province, in which only members of the matriculated Baltic nobility held membership and cities were ruled by German burgomasters.

Between 1710 and approximately 1880, the Baltic German ruling class enjoyed great autonomy from the Imperial government and achieved great political influence in the Imperial court. Starting from the 18th century, the Baltic German nobility also assumed some leading posts in the Russian imperial government.

Germans, other than the local estate-owners, mainly lived in the cities, such as Riga, &quot;Reval&quot;, &quot;Dorpat&quot;, &quot;Pernau&quot; and &quot;Mitau&quot;. As late as the mid-19th century, the population of many of these cities still had a German majority, with Estonian, Latvian or Jewish minorities. By 1867, Riga&#x27;s population was 42.9% German. Until the late 19th century, most of the professional and learned classes in the region, the &quot;literati&quot;, were Germans.

German political and cultural autonomy ceased in the 1880s, when Russification replaced German administration and schooling with the usage of Russian. After 1885 provincial governors usually were Russians.

====Rise of native peoples====
Years of peace under Russian rule brought increasing prosperity and many new manor houses were built on country estates, but economic exploitation worsened the situation of the native population.
For examples, see List of palaces and manor houses in Latvia and List of palaces and manor houses in Estonia.

The native Latvian and Estonian population enjoyed fewer rights under the Baltic German nobility compared with farmers in Germany or Sweden. In contrast to the Baltic Germans, Estonians and Latvians had restricted civil rights and resided mostly in rural areas as serfs, tradesmen, or as servants in manors and urban homes. They had no rights to leave their masters and no surnames. This was in keeping with the social scheme of things in Russian Empire. It lasted until the 19th century, when emancipation from serfdom brought those inhabitants increased civil freedoms and some political rights.

In 1804, Livonian peasant law was introduced by the Imperial government, aimed at improving conditions for serfs. Serfdom was abolished in all Baltic provinces between 1816 and 1820, about half a century earlier than in Russia proper. For some time, there was no outward tension between the German speakers and indigenous residents.

Earlier, if any Latvian or Estonian who managed to rise above his class was expected to Germanize and to forget his roots, by the mid-19th century German urban classes began to feel increasing competition from the natives, who after the First Latvian National Awakening and Estonian national awakening produced their own middle class and moved to German- and Jewish-dominated towns and cities in increasing numbers.

The Revolution of 1905 led to attacks against the Baltic German landowners, the burning of manors, and the torture and even killing of members of the nobility. During the 1905 Revolution groups of rebels burned over 400 manor houses and German-owned buildings and killed 82 Germans. In response Cossack punitive expeditions aided by German nobles and officers burned down hundreds of farms, arrested and deported thousands and summarily executed at least 2,000 people.

Reaction to 1905 Revolution included a scheme by Karl Baron von Manteuffel-Szoege and Silvio Broedrich-Kurmahlen to pacify the countryside by settling up to 20,000 ethnic German farmers, mostly from Volhynia, in Courland.

===World War I===

World War I brought the end of the alliance of the Baltic Germans and the Russian Tsarist government. German heritage led to their being viewed as the enemy by Russians. They were also seen as traitors by the German Empire if they remained loyal to Russia. Their loyalty to the state was questioned, and rumours of a German fifth column increased with the defeats of the Imperial army led by Baltic German general Paul von Rennenkampf. All German schools and societies were closed in the Estonian Governorate and Germans were ordered to leave the Courland Governorate for inner Russia.

Courland was conquered by Germany in 1915 and included into the military Ober Ost administration. After the Russian surrender at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918, the German Empire occupied the remaining Baltic provinces.

The Ober Ost military administration began plans for German colonization of Courland. On April 20, 1917, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern front announced that a third of arable land there should be reserved for settlement by German war veterans. This was approved by Courland&#x27;s German nobility on September 22, 1917.

====United Baltic Duchy====
Livonian and Estonian nobles delivered a note of independence to Soviet representatives in Stockholm on January 28, 1918, announcing their intention to break away from Russia under the rights granted to them by the Treaty of Nystad of 1721. In response, the Bolsheviks, who controlled Estonia, arrested 567 leading Germans and deported them to Russia. After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk they were allowed to return. Under German-Soviet treaties, Germany gained control over Courland, Riga, Saaremaa (Ösel), Livonia and Estonia.

In the spring of 1918, Baltic Germans announced the restoration of the independent Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and pursued plans for uniting it with the Kingdom of Prussia. On April 12, 1918, Baltic German representatives from all Baltic provinces met in Riga and called on the German Emperor to annex the Baltic lands.

Subsequently, a plan for a United Baltic Duchy ruled by Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg, instead of outright annexation, was developed. Its regency council met on November 9, 1918, but collapsed with the German Empire.

===Independent Baltic states===

The Baltic Germans&#x27; rule and class privileges came to the end with the demise of the Russian Empire (due to the Bolshevik revolution of October 1917) and the independence of Estonia and Latvia in 1918–1919.

Baltic Germans suffered greatly under Bolshevik regimes in Estonia and Latvia. While the Bolshevik regimes were short-lived, they pursued the Red Terror against Germans, often killing them purely because of their nationality.

After the collapse of the German Empire, Baltic Germans in Estonia began forming volunteer units to defend against the Bolshevik threat. On November 27, 1918 this was authorized by the Estonian government, and the Volunteer Baltic Battalion (&quot;Freiwilligen Baltenbataillon&quot;) was formed under the command of Colonel Constantin von Weiss (de).

During the Estonian and Latvian wars of independence from 1918 to 1920, many Baltic Germans voluntarily enlisted in the newly formed Estonian and Latvian armies to help secure the independence of these countries from Russia. These Baltic German military units became known as the &quot;Baltische Landeswehr&quot; in Latvia and &quot;Baltenregiment (de)&quot; in Estonia. The State archives of Estonia and Latvia keep individual military records of each person who fought in this war.

&quot;Baltische Landeswehr&quot; units took Riga on May 22, 1919 which was followed by White Terror in which up to 2,000 people, mostly Latvians, were shot as suspected Bolshevik supporters.

Baltic German outlying estates were frequent targets of local Bolsheviks (as portrayed in the film, &quot;Coup de Grâce&quot;) and the combination of local Bolsheviks and nationalists following independence brought about land nationalisations and a displacement of Baltic Germans from positions of authority. Baltic Germans of the Livonian Governorate found themselves in two new countries, both of which introduced sweeping agrarian reforms aimed at the large land owners, an absolute majority of whom were Germans.

As a result of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Russian Civil War, many Baltic Germans fled to Germany. After 1919, many Baltic Germans felt obliged to depart the newly independent states for Germany, but many stayed as ordinary citizens.

In 1925, there were 70,964 Germans in Latvia (3.6%) and 62,144 in 1935 (3.2% of population). Riga remained by far the largest German center with 38,523 Germans residing there in 1935, while Tallinn then had 6,575 Germans.

While the German landed class soon lost most of their lands after the agrarian reforms, they continued to work in their professions and to lead their companies. German cultural autonomy was respected. The Committee of the German Baltic Parties in Latvia and Deutsch-baltische Partei in Estland in Estonia participated in elections and won seats.

At the same time, as both young states built their institutions, this often reduced the status of their minorities. In Latvia, children of mixed marriages were registered as Latvians while in Estonia they took the nationality of their fathers, who increasingly were Estonians. This quickly reduced the number of German children. German place names were eliminated from public use. German congregations lost their churches. Tallinn Cathedral was given to an Estonian congregation in 1927. After the 1923 referendum St. James&#x27;s Cathedral in Riga was lost and Riga Cathedral taken away after another referendum in 1931.
====Agrarian reforms====

At the start of independence, Baltic Germans owned 58% of land in Estonia and 48% in Latvia. Radical agrarian reforms were implemented in both countries to break German power and to distribute land to the veterans of independence wars and landless peasants. This largely destroyed the landed class of German noble families and their economic base.

On October 10, 1919, the Estonian parliament expropriated 1,065 estates (96.6% of all estates). The law of March 1, 1926 set the compensation to the former owners of arable land at about 3% of its market value and no compensation at all for the forests. This almost instantly bankrupted the German noble class, even if they were allowed to keep some 50 hectares of their lands.

On September 16, 1920, the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia nationalized 1,300 estates comprising 3.7million hectares of land. Former German owners were allowed to keep 50 hectares of land and farm equipment. In 1924, the Saeima decided that no compensation would be paid to former owners. In 1929, the Saeima voted that veterans of the &quot;Baltische Landeswehr&quot; could not receive any land.

====Estonia====
In Estonia, there was only one German party, which from 1926 was led by Axel de Vries (de), editor of &quot;Revaler Bote&quot;. Their leading parliamentarian was Werner Hasselblatt (1890–1958). Germans never received ministerial posts in governments. The three largest minorities – Germans, Swedes and Russians – sometimes formed election coalitions. The &quot;Deutsch-baltische Partei in Estland&quot; was established to defend the interests of German landowners, who wanted to receive compensation for their nationalized lands and properties. After land nationalization they received no compensation, but could keep plots up to 50 hectares, which was not enough to support their manor houses.

Germans were banned from governmental and military positions. Many Germans sold their properties and emigrated to Scandinavia or Western Europe. Most of the grand manor houses were taken over by schools, hospitals, local administration and museums.

Estonia&#x27;s Baltic German population was smaller than Latvia&#x27;s, so as Estonians continued to fill professional positions such as law and medicine, there was less of a leadership role for the Baltic Germans. Baron Wilhelm Wrangell, leader of the Baltic German cultural association between 1933 and 1938 was included in the Estonian Council of State after 1937 as a token representative of minorities. The last leader of Baltic German Cultural administration was Hellmuth Weiss.

On February 12, 1925, Estonia adopted the Cultural Autonomy and National Minorities Act, which provided for some cultural autonomy of Germans. Despite this, the German community in Estonia continued to decline as the majority of young people chose to emigrate. By 1934, there were 16,346 Baltic Germans in Estonia, 1.5% of the total population.

Estonia allowed German schools to teach in the German language. These schools were overseen by the &quot;Gesellschaft Deutsche Schulhilfe&quot;, which was part of the Union of German Societies in Estonia. After adoption of the Minority law of February 5, 1925 the Baltic German Cultural Council was created on November 1, 1925. In 1928, German schools were attended by 3,456 pupils.

====Latvia====
In Latvia, Baltic Germans remained a politically active and organized ethnic group, although they lost some influence after the 1934 Latvian coup d&#x27;état. A couple of times Germans received ministerial posts in coalition governments. The commander of Latvia&#x27;s Navy between 1919 and 1931 was Admiral Archibald Count of Keyserlingk.

Six, later seven, German parties existed and formed a coalition in the Saeima. The leading politicians were Baron Wilhelm Friedrich Karl von Fircks, leader of the Baltic-German People&#x27;s Party and Paul Schiemann, editor-in-chief of the &quot;Rigasche Rundschau&quot; newspaper and leader of the Baltic-German Democratic Party. Increased activity of National Socialist supporters in the German community led to the resignation of Schiemann from the &quot;Rigasche Rundschau&quot; in 1933.

Minority cultural affairs were overseen by the Ministry of Culture and the German section was led by pastor Karl Keller (1868–1939) and later by Wolfgang Wachtsmuth. In 1923, there were 12,168 pupils in German schools. The Herder Institute, a private German university with three faculties (Theology, Jurisprudence and Political Science and Philosophy) was established.

In 1926, the German community introduced voluntary self-taxation, asking all Germans to contribute up to 3% of their monthly income to community activities. In 1928, the Baltic German National Community was established as the central representative body of Baltic Germans in Latvia.

The educational autonomy of Germans was severely limited in 1931–1933, when the Minister of Education Atis Ķeniņš introduced a policy of latvianization in minority schools. On July 18, 1934 the autonomous German schools were brought under complete control of the Ministry of Education.

After the coup of May 15, 1934, all associations and independent business organizations had to shut down. This affected the German community especially hard, as they lost their ancient communal centers – guilds, and all of their property was nationalized. A wave of takeovers of Jewish, Russian and German businesses then followed; banks, factories and trading companies were purchased by state-owned banks at set rates in order to reduce minority control over businesses.

===Resettlement of all Baltic Germans (1939–1944)===

====1939–1940====

In 1940, Estonia and Latvia became Soviet republics. One of the main conditions imposed by Hitler on Stalin in August 1939 was the prior transfer of all ethnic Germans living in Estonia and Latvia to areas under German military control. These became known as the Nazi–Soviet population transfers. Stalin proceeded to set up Soviet military bases in Estonia and Latvia in late 1939.

In a speech to the Reichstag on October 6, 1939, which was broadcast live on radio, Hitler announced that German minorities should be resettled in the Reich (Back home to the Reich, &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot;). Resettlement was overseen by Himmler who created a new Reich Commisariat for the Strengthening of Germandom for this purpose.

Treaties were signed with Estonia and Latvia in 1939 and 1940 concerning the emigration of Baltic Germans and the liquidation of their educational, cultural, and religious institutions. Nazi Germany succeeded in getting the Baltic Germans to abandon their homes and homeland in haste. Due to the imposition of wartime rationing, Germans were banned from taking along any valuables, objects of historic value, fuels and even food. A massive sell-off of household items and small businesses followed. Larger properties, real estate and businesses were sold over a longer period of time by a special German commission to local governments.

*Some 13,700 Baltic Germans were resettled from Estonia by early 1940.
*Around 51,000 Baltic Germans were resettled from Latvia by early 1940.

The Estonian and Latvian governments published books containing alphabetical lists of the names of resettled Baltic German adults together with their birthdate, birthplace and last address in the Baltics.

Baltic Germans left by ships from the port cities of Estonia and Latvia to the ports of Gdynia and Szczecin and then were transported to Poznań and Łódź in &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Warthegau&quot;) and other Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany. The &quot;new&quot; homes and farms they were given to live in had been owned and inhabited by Poles and Jews just a few months earlier who were executed or deported eastwards when Nazi Germany invaded Poland. The new arrivals fulfilled Nazi plans for the ethnic Germanization of these lands.

====Spring 1941 resettlement====
In early 1941, the Nazi German government arranged another resettlement for all those who had refused to leave in 1939 or 1940. The action was called the &quot;Nachumsiedlung&quot;. This time around no compensation was offered for any property or belongings left behind and this group of resettlers were treated with intense suspicion or considered traitors because they had refused Hitler&#x27;s first call to leave the Baltics in 1939. Most of these arrivals were first settled in filtration camps. Unknown to the general public, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was only two to four months away, and this was Hitler&#x27;s last chance to transfer these people in peacetime conditions.

By this time, the remaining Baltic Germans in Estonia and Latvia found themselves in a vastly different situation than in 1939. Their countries were now occupied by the Soviet Union, and intense pressure and intimidation had been put on anyone with a position of privilege or wealth before 1939. Mass arrests and some killings had taken place. Fearing a worsening of the situation, the vast majority of the remaining Baltic Germans decided to leave. About 7,000 resettled from Estonia by late March 1941, and approximately 10,500 resettled from Latvia by late March 1941. Even though the German government had planned a relocation that would be limited to ethnic Germans only, ultimately a considerable share of resettlers were non-Germans of various ethnicities (mostly Estonians and Latvians, but also individuals of Slavic ethnicity), who used this as the only legal route to escape the Soviet regime.

No books were published listing those who resettled in 1941; however, the present-day archives of Estonia and Latvia still have the lists of all those who left in this year.

====1941–1944====
A very small minority of Baltic Germans refused again to be resettled and remained in the Baltics past March 1941. Some fell victim to the Soviet deportations to Siberian gulags beginning in early June 1941. The names and data of those deported from Estonia from 1941 to 1953 have been published in books. Details are kept at the Museum of Occupations in Estonia.

After the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union and the conquest of Latvia and Estonia, a small number of Baltic Germans were allowed to return in order to serve as translators, but requests of many resettled Germans to be allowed to return to their homelands were denied by Himmler&#x27;s SS. Many German Baltic men were mobilized in the occupied Warthegau and served in the German army.

The resettled Germans fled west with the retreating German army in 1944. No precise numbers or lists are available for them. However, several thousand Baltic Germans remained in the Baltics after 1944, but they were subject to widespread discrimination (and possible deportation to Siberia until 1953) by the Soviet authorities ruling Estonia and Latvia. As a result of this, many hid or lied about their Baltic German origins. Most of those who stayed after 1944 were children of mixed ethnic marriages or themselves married to ethnic Estonians, Latvians or Russians and their descendants no longer consider themselves German.

====&quot;Second resettlement&quot; 1945====
The Soviet Union&#x27;s advance into Poland and Germany in late 1944 and early 1945 resulted in the Baltic Germans being evacuated by the German authorities (or simply fleeing) from their &quot;new homes&quot; to areas even further in the west to escape the advancing Red Army. Most of them settled in West Germany, with some ending up in East Germany.

In stark contrast to the resettlements in 1939–1941, this time the evacuation in most of the areas was delayed until the last moment, when it was too late to conduct it in an orderly fashion, and practically all of them had to leave most of their belongings behind. Seeing as they had been living in these &quot;new&quot; homes only for about five years, this was almost seen as a second forced resettlement for them, albeit under different circumstances. 

Many Baltic Germans were on board the KdF Ship &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; when it was sunk by a Soviet submarine on January 30, 1945. By one estimate, about 9,400 people on board died, which would make it the largest loss of life in a single ship sinking in history. Additionally, many Baltic Germans died during the sinking of the SS &quot;General von Steuben&quot; on February 10, 1945.

Two books listing the names and personal data of all Baltic Germans who died as a result of the resettlements and wartime conditions between 1939 and 1947 have been published by the Baltic German genealogical society: &quot;Deutsch-baltisches Gedenkbuch. Unsere Toten der Jahre 1939–1947&quot; by Karin von Borbély, Darmstadt, 1991; and &quot;Nachtrag zum Deutsch-baltisches Gedenkbuch&quot; by Karin von Borbély, Darmstadt, 1995.

With Estonia and Latvia falling under Soviet rule after 1944, most Baltic Germans did not return to the Soviet-occupied Baltics.

====Canada====
Many thousands of Baltic Germans emigrated to Canada starting in 1948 with the support of Canadian Governor General The Earl Alexander of Tunis, who had known many Baltic Germans when he had commanded the Baltic German Landeswehr for a short time in 1919. Initially, only 12 Germans were allowed to settle in 1948. Based on the good behavior of this group, many thousands of Baltic Germans were soon allowed to immigrate during the following years.

A small group of Latvians and Baltic Germans emigrated to Newfoundland as part of then Premier Joseph Smallwood&#x27;s New Industries Program. Several families in Corner Brook built, operated and worked in the cement and gypsum plants that provided essential material for the creation of Newfoundland&#x27;s infrastructure after Confederation.

===Destruction of cultural heritage in the Soviet Baltics (1945–1989)===

During the Soviet Baltic time, Soviet authorities governing the Estonian SSR and the Latvian SSR, politically empowered by their victory in World War II, were keen to erase any traces of ethnic German rule in past centuries. Numerous statues, monuments, structures or landmarks with German writing were destroyed, vandalized or left to ruin.

The largest Baltic German cemeteries in Estonia, Kopli cemetery and Mõigu cemetery, both standing since 1774, were completely destroyed by the Soviet authorities. The Great Cemetery of Riga, the largest burial ground of Baltic Germans in Latvia, standing since 1773, also had the vast majority of its graves destroyed by the Soviets.

===1989 to present===

The present-day governments of Estonia and Latvia, who regained their independence in 1991, generally take a positive, or sometimes neutral, view towards the contributions of the Baltic Germans in the development of their cities and countries throughout their history. An occasional exception to this comes with some criticism in relation to the major landowners, who controlled most of the rural areas of the Baltics, and the ethnic Estonians and Latvians, until 1918.

After Estonia regained independence from the Soviet Union on August 20, 1991, the exiled association of the German Baltic nobility sent an official message to the president-to-be Lennart Meri that no member of the association would claim proprietary rights to their former Estonian lands. This, and the fact that the first German ambassadors to Estonia and Latvia were both Baltic Germans, helped to further reconcile the Baltic Germans with these two countries.

Cooperation between Baltic German societies and the governments of Estonia and Latvia has made the restoration of many small Baltic German plaques and landmarks possible, such as monuments to those who fought in the 1918–1920 War of Independence.

Since 1989, many elderly Baltic Germans, or their descendants, have taken holidays to Estonia and Latvia to look for traces of their own past, their ancestral homes, and their family histories. Most of the remaining manor houses have new owners, and operate as hotels that are open to the public.

==Notable Baltic Germans==
Baltic Germans played leading roles in the society of what are now Estonia and Latvia throughout most of the period from 13th to mid-20th century, with many of them becoming noted scientists, including Karl Ernst von Baer, Emil Lenz, and Friedrich Zander and explorers, such as Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, Adam Johann von Krusenstern, Ferdinand von Wrangel and Otto Schmidt. A number of Baltic Germans served as ranking generals in the Russian Imperial Army and Navy, including Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly, Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden, Paul von Rennenkampf and Franz Eduard von Totleben.

Many Baltic Germans, such as Baron Pyotr Wrangel, Baron Ungern, Eugen Müller and Prince Anatol von Lieven, sided with the Whites and related anti-Bolshevik forces (like the &quot;Baltische Landeswehr&quot; and the &quot;Freikorps&quot; movement) during the Russian Civil War.

<doc id="75222" wikidata="Q498442" url="?curid=75222" title="Spaceballs">
<text>Spaceballs is a 1987 American space opera parody film co-written, produced and directed by Mel Brooks. It primarily parodies the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, but also of other popular franchises such as &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, and &quot;Transformers&quot;. The film stars Bill Pullman, John Candy, and Rick Moranis, with the supporting cast including Daphne Zuniga, Dick Van Patten, George Wyner, Lorene Yarnell, and the voice of Joan Rivers. In addition to Brooks playing a dual role, the film also features Brooks regulars Dom DeLuise and Rudy De Luca in cameo appearances.

In &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, heroic mercenary Lone Starr (Pullman) and his alien sidekick Barf (Candy) rescue Princess Vespa (Zuniga) of Druidia and her droid, Dot Matrix (Yarnell, voiced by Rivers), from being captured by the Spaceballs, led by President Skroob (Brooks), who wants to use Vespa as ransom to obtain Druidia&#x27;s air for their own planet. However, the heroes get stranded on a desert moon, where they encounter the wise Yogurt (also Brooks), who teaches Starr about the metaphysical power known as &quot;the Schwartz&quot;. Meanwhile, Spaceball commanders Dark Helmet (Moranis) and Colonel Sandurz (Wyner) lead the search for them but are hindered by their own incompetence.

The film was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) on June 24, 1987. A sequel is in the early stages of development as of June 2024.

==Plot==
Planet Spaceball, led by the incompetent President Skroob, has squandered all of its fresh air. Skroob plans to steal the atmosphere from the neighboring planet of Druidia by forcing its ruler King Roland to give him the code to the shield surrounding it. Meanwhile, Roland&#x27;s daughter Princess Vespa flees Druidia in order to avoid an arranged marriage to the narcoleptic Prince Valium. The ship &quot;Spaceball One&quot;, commanded by Colonel Sandurz and carrying Skroob&#x27;s enforcer Dark Helmet, is dispatched to kidnap Vespa and her droid servant Dot Matrix.

Mercenary Lone Starr and his &quot;Mawg&quot; (half man, half dog) companion Barf, in their Winnebago spaceship &quot;Eagle 5&quot;, are contacted by crime boss Pizza the Hutt and his robotic minion Vinny to retrieve the money they owe them &quot;or else Pizza is gonna send out for you&quot;. Roland contacts Lone Starr and offers them a high reward if they bring Vespa and Dot back to Druidia. The pair retrieve Vespa and Dot and escape via light speed before they can be brought aboard &quot;Spaceball One&quot;. Dark Helmet and a reluctant Sandurz use &quot;Ludicrous Speed&quot;, but heavily overshoot the group when they try to follow. &quot;Eagle 5&quot; runs out of fuel and Lone Starr is forced to crash-land on a desert moon.

The four escapees travel on foot for a while, but ultimately pass out in the relentless heat. They are found by the Dink-Dinks, a group of diminutive aliens in sparkly robes, and taken to the hidden cave of the sage Yogurt. He advertises the film&#x27;s fictitious tie-in merchandise, then begins to instruct Lone Starr in the ways of a mysterious power known as the Schwartz (which Helmet can also control). Lone Starr and Vespa develop romantic feelings for each other, despite Vespa&#x27;s insistence that she can only marry a prince, and Lone Starr shows Yogurt a medallion bearing an indecipherable message that was found with him when he was abandoned as a baby.

The Spaceballs break the fourth wall by going through a VHS copy of the film to locate the &quot;Eagle 5&quot;&#x27;s whereabouts. Helmet disguises himself as Roland to lure Vespa and Dot out of the cave. As Lone Starr and Barf prepare to chase Helmet, Yogurt gives Lone Starr a ring that he can use to channel the Schwartz.

Helmet extorts the air shield code from Roland by threatening to have a plastic surgeon reverse Vespa&#x27;s nose job, then imprisons her and Dot. Lone Starr and Barf infiltrate the prison and break them out, and all four escape in &quot;Eagle 5&quot; while leaving their stunt doubles to be captured. &quot;Spaceball One&quot; transforms itself into a giant maid (&quot;Mega-Maid&quot;), opens the shield, and uses a vacuum cleaner (vacuum of space) to suck the air from Druidia. Lone Starr taps into the Schwartz to reverse the flow and return the air (saving Roland and the Druidians), then pilots &quot;Eagle 5&quot; into the head of &quot;Mega-Maid&quot;.

Lone Starr finds a self-destruct button, but Helmet interrupts and they engage in a duel using lightsaber-like weapons that extend from their Schwartz rings. Helmet steals Lone Starr&#x27;s ring and drops it through a floor grate, but Lone Starr gets a telepathic message from Yogurt telling him that the power lies within him instead of the ring. As Helmet prepares to attack, Lone Starr levitates a mirror and reflects Helmet&#x27;s blast, knocking him into the self-destruct button. Lone Starr returns to &quot;Eagle 5&quot; and pilots it to safety; Skroob, Helmet and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time and discover the &quot;cancellation button&quot; is out of order as &quot;Mega-Maid&quot; explodes.

Lone Starr and Barf discover on the news that Pizza the Hutt had locked himself in a limousine and ate himself to death, absolving them of the debt. The duo return Vespa and Dot to Roland, but take only enough money to cover their expenses. The remnants of the &quot;Mega-Maid&quot; crash-land on a nearby planet populated by intelligent apes, who express dismay at the stranded Spaceballs.

After being scared by a singing xenomorph at a diner, Lone Starr and Barf find a final message from Yogurt hidden in a fortune cookie, telling them that Lone Starr&#x27;s medallion means he is a prince and can thus marry Vespa. The two return to Druidia just in time to stop her wedding to Valium, and Lone Starr announces his royal lineage and marries Vespa. The film ends with them riding off in &quot;Eagle 5&quot; and a message to the audience stating, &quot;May the Schwartz Be With You&quot;.

==Production==

When Brooks developed &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, he wanted his parody to be as close to the original as possible. Even though the Yogurt character (Mel Brooks) mentions merchandising in the film, Brooks&#x27;s deal with George Lucas on parodying &quot;Star Wars&quot; was that no &quot;Spaceballs&quot; action figures be made. According to Brooks, &quot;[Lucas] said, &#x27;Your [action figures] are going to look like mine.&#x27; I said OK.&quot; However, this agreement inspired Brooks to write Yogurt&#x27;s &quot;Merchandising&quot; scene and include multiple &quot;Spaceballs&quot;-branded products at other points in the film, such as placemats and toilet paper. While no mass produced &quot;Spaceballs&quot; merchandise was ever created, Max Brooks revealed in 2023 that he is in possession of the Yogurt doll used in the merchandise scene.

Brooks also had Lucas&#x27; company handle some post-production, saying, &quot;I was playing ball with the people who could have said no.&quot; Lucas later sent Brooks a note saying how much he loved the film, including its story structure, and that he &quot;was afraid [he] would bust something from laughing&quot;. According to Rick Moranis, &quot;In the original script, the description of [Dark Helmet] was that the whole costume was one gigantic helmet. Then it got scaled back to just an exaggerated version of the Darth Vader helmet.&quot;

The bulk of the film&#x27;s visual effects were executed by Apogee Inc., which was founded by former Industrial Light &amp; Magic employee John Dykstra.

Pullman got the part of Lone Starr when Brooks and his wife Anne Bancroft saw him in a play—he had never seen &quot;Star Wars&quot; prior to filming. Brooks had been unsuccessfully trying to sign on big-name actors such as Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks for the film. Pullman said,

I think [Mel] was hurt that they didn&#x27;t take him up on it ... but then it attract[ed] two of the big comics at that time: John Candy and Rick Moranis. Once that was secured, then he said, &quot;Heck, I&#x27;ll get somebody nobody knows!&quot; And I got a chance to do it.

Zuniga initially found Brooks&#x27; film parodies &quot;too crass and not too funny&quot;, but after working with Brooks, she said, &quot;I have this image of Mel as totally wacko and out to lunch. And he is. But he&#x27;s also really perceptive, real sensitive in ways that make actors respond.&quot;

==Music==
An official soundtrack was released on Atlantic Records on LP, CD, and cassette, featuring many of the songs heard in the film, as well as three score cues by frequent Brooks collaborator John Morris. The track list is as follows:

# &quot;My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own&quot; – Jeffrey Osborne and Kim Carnes; the song was made into a hit in 1990 by Sally Moore (U.S. AC #42).
# &quot;Heartstrings&quot; – Berlin
# &quot;Spaceballs Love Theme&quot; (Instrumental) – John Morris
# &quot;The Winnebago Crashes&quot;/&quot;The Spaceballs Build Mega-Maid&quot; – John Morris
# &quot;Spaceballs&quot; – The Spinners
# &quot;Hot Together&quot; – The Pointer Sisters
# &quot;Good Enough&quot; – Van Halen
# &quot;Wanna Be Loved by You&quot; – Ladyfire

&quot;Raise Your Hands&quot; by Bon Jovi is also used prominently in the film.

In the film the Dinks (based on Jawas) perform the 1914 marching song &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;, though they sing &quot;Dink dink, dink dink dink dink dink dink... Dink dink&quot; rather than whistle, parodying the scene from &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;.

In 2006, La-La Land Records released &quot;Spaceballs – The 19th Anniversary Edition&quot; CD of the film&#x27;s score, with bonus tracks of alternate takes and tracks not used in the film.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
The film had an estimated $22.7 million budget, and ultimately grossed $38,119,483 during its run in the United States, taking in $6,613,837 on its opening weekend, finishing behind &quot;Dragnet&quot;.

===Critical reception===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 52% of 104 critics have given positive reviews and an average rating of 5.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads; &quot;There&#x27;s fine spoofery and amusing characters in &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, though it&#x27;s a far cry from Mel Brooks&#x27; peak era.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 14 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

At the time of the film&#x27;s release, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and remarked &quot;I enjoyed a lot of the movie, but I kept thinking I was at a revival ... it should have been made several years ago, before our appetite for &quot;Star Wars&quot; satires had been completely exhausted.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying that there were &quot;just enough funny visual gags to recommend this wildly uneven film&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; said that the film was a misguided parody and not very funny.

The film won Worst Picture at the 1987 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

===Impact===
The film gained a cult following in the following years.

Tesla Motors has used the film&#x27;s starship speeds (Light Speed, Ridiculous Speed, Ludicrous Speed, Plaid Speed) as inspiration for naming their acceleration modes. In homage to &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, Tesla has &quot;Ludicrous Mode&quot; for acceleration beyond its Insane Mode, and &quot;Plaid Mode&quot;, overtop Ludicrous.

A clip from the film, alongside clips of other &quot;Star Wars&quot; parody works, was used in a &quot;special look&quot; internet video used to promote &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; in order to show the cultural impact of Star Wars.

==Home media==
&quot;Spaceballs&quot; was first made available on VHS and LaserDisc in February 1988; they were re-released in the late 1990s. The VHS edition was issued twice; the latter edition was presented in widescreen. Meanwhile, the laserdisc also gained a commentary track with Brooks; this was transferred over to the DVD and Blu-ray releases. The film was first released on DVD on April 25, 2000. This version also contained &quot;the making of...&quot; documentary and a collectible &quot;making-of&quot; booklet. The film was then released in the &quot;Collectors Edition&quot; on May 3, 2005. This edition contained more extras including the documentary and the video conversation about the making of the film with Brooks and Thomas Meehan. On August 7, 2012, the &quot;25th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released on Blu-ray containing many of the same bonus features as the 2005 DVD release with the addition of a new featurette. An Ultra HD Blu-ray edition of the film was released on April 12, 2021 by Kino Lorber, with all of the special features from previous home video releases included.

==In other media==
* A novelization for the film was released on June 1, 1987, written by R. L. Stine under the pen name Jovial Bob Stine, along with Mel Brooks, Thomas Meehan, and Ronny Graham.
* &quot;Spaceballs&quot; was developed into an animated television show which debuted in September 2008 as &quot;&quot; on G4 (US) and Super Channel (Canada).
* In the episode &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot; of the American adult sketch comedy television series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; the segment &quot;George Lucas At The Convention&quot; features a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan wearing a Barf costume from &quot;Spaceballs&quot;.
* Moranis vocally reprised his role as Dark Helmet in the episode &quot;Spaceballs&quot; of the American sitcom &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;.

==Props==
A -scale model of the Winnebago, &quot;Eagle 5&quot;, was auctioned on December 11, 2018. The model was created by film special effects designer Grant McCune, who also created models for &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The model makes an appearance early in the film with the introduction of Barf and Lone Starr. The model, along with other special effects artifacts from then-current films such as &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; and &quot;&quot;, was displayed at Chicago&#x27;s Museum of Science and Industry in the summer of 1988.

==Sequel==
Moranis claimed in a 2013 interview that he and Brooks had discussed a potential sequel, with Moranis pitching the title &quot;Spaceballs III: The Search for Spaceballs II&quot;. However, he and Brooks were unable to structure a deal that would allow the project to move forward. In February 2015, Brooks said that he would like to make a sequel to be released after the next &quot;Star Wars&quot; film and hoped that Moranis would reprise his role. This proposed film, Brooks said, may be called &quot;Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money&quot;. However, in February 2020, Bill Pullman said during an interview with &quot;Daily Blast Live&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s up to Mel. Ask him if he has too much money and that&#x27;s why he doesn&#x27;t do it.&quot;

In June 2024, it was announced that a sequel is in the early stages of development at Amazon MGM Studios with Josh Gad attached to star and co-produce the film alongside Brooks. Josh Greenbaum is attached to direct the film with a script from Benji Samit, Dan Hernandez, and Gad.

<doc id="75224" wikidata="Q6458736" url="?curid=75224" title="LINC">
<text>The LINC (Laboratory INstrument Computer) is a 12-bit, 2048-word transistorized computer. The LINC is considered by some to be the first minicomputer and a forerunner to the personal computer. Originally named the Linc, suggesting the project&#x27;s origins at MIT&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory, it was renamed LINC after the project moved from the Lincoln Laboratory. The LINC was designed by Wesley A. Clark and Charles Molnar.

The LINC and other &quot;MIT Group&quot; machines were designed at MIT and eventually built by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and Spear Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts (later a division of Becton, Dickinson and Company). The LINC sold for more than $40,000 at the time. A typical configuration included an enclosed 6&#x27;X20&quot; rack; four boxes holding (1) two tape drives, (2) display scope and input knobs, (3) control console and (4) data terminal interface; and a keyboard.

The LINC interfaced well with laboratory experiments. Analog inputs and outputs were part of the basic design. It was designed in 1962 by Charles Molnar and Wesley Clark at Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts, for NIH researchers. The LINC&#x27;s design was in the public domain, perhaps making it unique in the history of computers. A dozen LINC computers were assembled by their eventual biomedical researcher owners in a 1963 summer workshop at MIT. Digital Equipment Corporation (starting in 1964) and, later, Spear Inc. of Waltham, Massachusetts, manufactured them commercially.

DEC&#x27;s pioneer C. Gordon Bell states that the LINC project began in 1961, with first delivery in March 1962, and the machine was not formally withdrawn until December 1969. A total of 50 were built (all using DEC System Module Blocks and cabinets), most at Lincoln Labs, housing the desktop instruments in four wooden racks. The first LINC included two oscilloscope displays. Twenty-one were sold by DEC at $43,600 (), delivered in the Production Model design. In these, the tall cabinet sitting behind a white Formica-covered table held two somewhat smaller metal boxes holding the same instrumentation, a Tektronix display oscilloscope over the &quot;front panel&quot; on the user&#x27;s left, a bay for interfaces over two LINC-Tape drives on the user&#x27;s right, and a chunky keyboard between them. The standard program development software (an assembler/editor) was designed by Mary Allen Wilkes; the last version was named LAP6 (LINC Assembly Program 6).

==Architecture==
The LINC has 2048 12-bit words of memory in two sections. Only the first 1024 words were usable for program execution. The second section of memory could only be used for data.

Programs can use a 12-bit accumulator and a one-bit link register. The first sixteen locations in program memory have special functions. Location 0 supports the single-level of subroutine call, automatically being updated with a return address on every jump instruction. The next fifteen locations can be used as index registers by one of the addressing modes. A programmable, six-bit relay register is intended for use by external instruments.

A later modification to the LINC added a 12-bit Z register to facilitate extended precision arithmetic, and an interrupt was provided forcing execution to location 21 (octal).

Alphanumeric input/output devices included a dedicated keyboard, and the ability to display text on the attached point-addressed CRT. A teleprinter could be connected for printed output.

Arithmetic was ones&#x27; complement, which meant that there were representations for &quot;plus zero&quot; and &quot;minus zero&quot;.

The original LINC required 8 microseconds for each instruction.

===Instruction set===
The natural notation used for the LINC was octal. In this section, all numbers are given as base ten unless identified as octal. The LINC instruction set was designed for ease of use with scientific instruments or custom experimental apparatus.
* Miscellaneous class, no address - Halt, clear accumulator, enable tape mark write gate, transfer accumulator to relay register, read relay register to accumulator, no operation, complement accumulator
* Shift class, no address (all operate on the accumulator and optionally the link bit) - rotate left, rotate right, scale right (replicates sign bit), 
* Full address class, two word instructions. immediate address given in second 12-bit word of the opcode - add, store and clear accumulator, jump. Only the first 1024 words of memory can be accessed.
* Skip class, skips the next instruction, can test for set or clear condition. Conditions are: external logic line (14 input lines could be tested), key struck, one of five sense switches, accumulator positive, link bit zero, or active tape unit in an interblock zone. Later models added skip on bit 0 of the Z register, skip on overflow, and skip on interrupt paused.
* Index class - these instructions could either have a second word that was the immediate operand, or that specified the operand address, or that specified one of the registers 01 through 15 (decimal) as holding the address of the operand. The address was incremented. These instructions included load or add to accumulator, add accumulator to memory, add accumulator with carry to memory, multiply (producing a 22 bit signed product), skip if equal, skip and rotate, bit clear, bit set, and bit complement. Another instruction in this group was to display a bit map, to represent a character or other data, on the built-in CRT display screen. 
* Half-word class - instructions operating on the lower or upper six bits of a word. These included load half, store half, skip if halves are different,
* Set - moves data from any memory location to one of the locations 1 through 15. 
* Sample - reads one of the sixteen 8-bit analog to digital converters and places the signed value in the accumulator. The first eight A/D channels were dedicated to control panel knobs to allow interaction with a running program by the user. The instruction could either hold the computer till a conversion result was ready, or allow more instructions to be executed provided they didn&#x27;t rely on the contents of the accumulator, which would be overwritten by the A/D conversion value. 
* Display - draws a pixel on one of the CRT displays at a specified location, optionally indexing a register.
* Index and skip - adds one to one of the memory locations 1 through 15, and skips if a 10-bit overflow occurs.
* Operate class, used for input/output operations. These included set a bit on one of 14 output lines, read the keyboard, or read the left or right switch bank. 
* Tape class, with opcodes to position the tape, read or write to the tape, and to check the tape against memory.

== Control panel ==
The LINC control panel is used for single-stepping through programs and for program debugging. Execution can be stopped when the program counter matched a set of switches. Another function allows execution to be stopped when a particular address was accessed. The single-step and the resume functions can be automatically repeated. The repetition rate can be varied over four orders of magnitude by means of an analog knob and a four-position decade switch, from about one step per second to about half of the full speed. Running a program at one step per second and gradually accelerating it to full speed provided an extremely dramatic way to experience and appreciate the speed of the computer.

== LINCtape ==
A noteworthy feature of the LINC was the LINCtape. It was a fundamental part of the machine design, not an optional peripheral, and the machine&#x27;s OS relied on it. The LINCtape can be compared to a linear diskette with a slow seek time. The magnetic tape drives on large machines of the day stored large quantities of data, took minutes to spool from end to end, but could not reliably update blocks of data in place. In contrast, the LINCtape was a small, nimble device which stored about 400K, had a fixed formatting track allowing data to be repeatedly read and re-written to the same locations, and took less than a minute to spool from one end to the other. The tape was formatted in fixed-sized blocks, and was used to hold a directory and file system. A single hardware instruction could seek and then read or write multiple tape blocks all in one operation.

Filenames were six characters long. The file system allowed for two files—a source file and an executable binary file to be stored under the same name. In effect it was a 6.1 filename in which the extension was restricted to &quot;S&quot; or &quot;B&quot;. Since the basic LINC had only 1024 12-bit words of core memory (RAM)—and the big, expanded LINC had only 2048—normal operations depended heavily on swapping to and from LINCtape. Digital later patented and marketed a similar design under the name DECtape; Digital&#x27;s patents on DECtape were eventually tested in court and found invalid.

LINCtape is also remembered for its reliability, which was higher than that of the diskettes which supplanted it. LINCtape incorporated a very simple form of redundancy—all data was duplicated in two locations across the tape. LINC users demonstrated this by punching holes in a tape with an ordinary office paper punch. Tape damaged in this way was perfectly readable. The formatting track made operation almost independent of tape speed, which was, in fact, quite variable. There was no capstan; the motion of the tape during reading and writing was directly controlled by the reel motors. There was no fast forward or rewind—reading and writing was performed at fast forward and rewind speeds. In some modes of operation, the data transfers were audible over the built-in loudspeaker and produced a very characteristic series of harsh bird-like squawks with varying pitch.

== Keyboard ==
The LINC keyboard, manufactured by company named Soroban Engineering, had a unique locking solenoid. The internal mechanism of each key had a slot that worked with a set of bars to encode the character and another slot that caught a locking bar, which locked all the keys in one mechanical movement of the locking solenoid.

When the user pressed a key, the pressed key was locked in its down position, and all the other keys were locked in the up position. When the running program read the keyboard, the lock was released, and the pressed key would pop back up. This could have the effect of slowing down typing and preventing even 2-key rollover. This exotic keyboard was abandoned in favor of Teletype keyboards, such as the Model 35 KSR and Model 37 KSR, in the LINC-8 and PDP-12 follow-on computers.

== Knobs ==

The LINC included a set of eight three-turn potentiometers (numbered 0-7) that could each be read by a computer instruction. The dial box was a convenient user input device at a time before general adoption of the mouse. For example, one knob could control the scaling of a displayed graph, and another might be used as a cursor to display the actual data value at a point.

== Text display ==

The LINC hardware allowed a 12-bit word to be rapidly and automatically displayed on the screen as a 4-wide by 6-high matrix of pixels, making it possible to display full screens of flicker-free text with a minimum of dedicated hardware. The standard display routines generated 4 by 6 character cells, giving the LINC one of the coarsest character sets ever designed.

The display screen was a CRT about 5 inches square which was actually a standard Tektronix oscilloscope with special plug-in amplifiers. The special plug-ins could be replaced with standard oscilloscope plug-ins for use in diagnostic maintenance of the computer. Many LINCs were supplied as kits to be assembled by the end user, so the oscilloscope came in handy.

The CRT used a very-long-persistence white or yellow phosphor, so that lines and curves drawn point-by-point at a relatively slow speed would remain visible throughout programmed drawing loops that frequently lasted half a second or more. The y-axis displayed both plus and minus zero as different values, unnecessarily reflecting the fact that the LINC used ones&#x27; complement arithmetic. Programmers quickly learned to move any negative displayed data up one point to hide the artifact that otherwise tended to appear at y=0.

Notoriously, a tight loop that displayed points repetitively in one place on the screen would burn a permanent dark hole in the delicate phosphor in well under a minute; programmers had to be ready to hit the Stop lever fast if a very bright spot suddenly appeared because of a programming mistake.

== Teletype output ==
Printed output on a Teletype Model 33 ASR was controlled by a single pole relay. A subroutine would convert the LINC character codes into ASCII and use timing loops to toggle the relay on and off, generating the correct 8-bit output to control the Teletype printer.

== Laboratory interface ==
The LINC connector module included bays for two plug-in chassis allowing custom interfacing to experimental setups. Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters were built into the computer and each could be accessed by a single machine instruction. Six relays were also available.

==Variants==
In addition to the original &quot;classic&quot; LINC, slight programming variations occurred when using the micro-LINC (μ-LINC) (1965), micro-LINC 300 (μ-LINC 300) (1968) (integrated circuit MECL] versions), and LINC-8. There were variations in the input/output equipment, access to memory. Later models had a faster clock speed.

==LINC-8 and PDP-12 computers==
While Bell in his book says designing the LINC provided the ideas for DEC&#x27;s second and third machines, the PDP-4 and the PDP-5. Digital Equipment Corporation would launch the extremely successful PDP-8 before it manufactured the first next-generation LINC-compatible computer, the LINC-8 and a combination PDP-8/I and LINC, combined as the PDP-12, the last machine incorporating the LINC instruction set. DEC&#x27;s final 12-bit lab machine, the LAB-8/E, did not incorporate the LINC instruction set. The first follow-on, the LINC-8, booted (slowly) to a PDP-8 program called PROGOFOP (PROGram OF OPeration) which interfaced to the separate LINC hardware. The PDP-12 was the last and most popular follow-on to the LINC. It was a capable and improved machine, and was more stable than the LINC-8, but architecturally was still an imperfect hybrid of a LINC and a PDP-8, full of many small technical glitches. (For example, the LINC had an overflow bit which was a small but important part of the LINC&#x27;s machine state; the PDP-12 had no provision for saving and restoring the state of this bit across PDP-8 interrupts.)

==MINC-11 computer==
Digital produced a version of the PDP-11/03 called the MINC-11, housed in a portable cart, and equipable with Digital-designed laboratory I/O modules supporting capabilities such as analog input and output. A programming language, MINC BASIC, included integrated support for the laboratory I/O modules. MINC stood for &quot;Modular Instrument Computer.&quot; The name undoubtedly was intended to evoke memories of the LINC, but the 16-bit machine had no architectural resemblance to, or compatibility with, the LINC.

<text>The Western Wall (, is an ancient retaining wall of the built-up hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount of Jerusalem. Its most famous section, known by the same name, often shortened by Jews to the Kotel or Kosel, is known in the West as the Wailing Wall, and in Islam as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق, &quot;Ḥā&#x27;iṭ al-Burāq&quot; ). In a Jewish religious context, the term Western Wall and its variations is used in the narrow sense, for the section used for Jewish prayer; in its broader sense it refers to the entire retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount.

At the prayer section, just over half the wall&#x27;s total height, including its 17 courses located below street level, dates from the end of the Second Temple period, and is believed to have been begun by Herod the Great. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the Umayyad period, while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.

The Western Wall plays an important role in Judaism due to it being part of the man-made &quot;Temple Mount&quot;, an artificially expanded hilltop best known as the traditional site of the Jewish Temple. Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray outside the Temple Mount platform, because the presumed site of the Holy of Holies, the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, presumably lies just above and behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger Temple compound to be built at its top. The earliest source possibly mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 10th century. The Western Wall, in the narrow sense, i.e. referring to the section used for Jewish prayer, is also known as the &quot;Wailing Wall&quot;, in reference to the practice of Jews weeping at the site. During the period of Christian Roman rule over Jerusalem (ca. 324–638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except on Tisha B&#x27;Av, the day of national mourning for the Temples. The term &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; has historically been used mainly by Christians, with use by Jews becoming marginal. Of the entire retaining wall, the section ritually used by Jews now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter, with the small exception of an section, the so-called &quot;Little Western Wall&quot; or &quot;Small Wailing Wall&quot;. This segment of the western retaining wall derives particular importance from having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much of the original Herodian stonework. In religious terms, the &quot;Little Western Wall&quot; is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the &quot;presence of God&quot; (Shechina), and the underground Warren&#x27;s Gate, which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century.

The entire Western Wall constitutes the western border of &quot;al-Haram al-Sharif&quot; (&quot;the Noble Sanctuary&quot;), or the Al-Aqsa compound. It is believed to be the site where the Islamic Prophet Muhammad tied his winged steed, the Burāq, on his Night Journey, which tradition connects to Jerusalem, before ascending to heaven. While the wall was considered an integral part of the Haram esh-Sharif and &quot;waqf&quot; property of the Moroccan Quarter under Muslim rule, a right of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage has long existed as part of the Status Quo regulations. This position was confirmed in a 1930 international commission during the British Mandate period. 

With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews and 116 Arabs were killed, with many more people injured. After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish Quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.
==Etymology==
===Western Wall===
Early Jewish texts referred to a &quot;western wall of the Temple&quot;, but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today &quot;the Western Wall&quot;, or to the western wall of the actual Temple. The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term &quot;ha-kotel ha-ma&#x27;aravi&quot;, &quot;the Western Wall&quot;, as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet Ahimaaz ben Paltiel.

===Wailing Wall===
The name &quot;Wailing Wall&quot;, and descriptions such as &quot;wailing place&quot;, appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century. The name &quot;Mur des Lamentations&quot; was used in French and &quot;Klagemauer&quot; in German. This description stemmed from the Jewish practice of coming to the site to mourn and bemoan the destruction of the Temple and the loss of national freedom it symbolized.
===Al-Buraq Wall===
Muslims have associated the name Al-Buraq with the wall at least since the 1860s.

==Location, dimensions, stones==

===Prayer section vs. entire wall===
The term Western Wall commonly refers to a exposed section of a much longer retaining wall, built by Herod on the western flank of the Temple Mount. Only when used in this sense is it synonymous with the term Wailing Wall. This section faces a large plaza and is set aside for prayer.

In its entirety, the western retaining wall of the Herodian Temple Mount complex stretches for , most of which is hidden behind medieval residential structures built along its length.

There are only two other revealed sections: the southern part of the Wall (see Robinson&#x27;s Arch area), which measures approximately , and is separated from the prayer area by just a narrow stretch of archaeological remains; and another, much shorter section, known as the Little Western Wall, which is located close to the Iron Gate.

The entire western wall functions as a retaining wall, supporting and enclosing the ample substructures built by Herod the Great around 19 BCE. Herod&#x27;s project was to create an artificial extension to the small quasi-natural plateau on which the First Temple stood, already widened in Hasmonean times during the Second Temple period, by finally transforming it into the almost rectangular, wide expanse of the Temple Mount platform visible today.

===Height, courses, building stones===
At the Western Wall Plaza, the total height of the Wall from its foundation is estimated at , with the above-ground section standing approximately high. The Wall consists of 45 stone courses, 28 of them above ground and 17 underground. The first seven above-ground layers are from the Herodian period. This section of wall is built from enormous meleke limestone blocks, possibly quarried at either Zedekiah&#x27;s Cave situated under the Muslim Quarter of the Old City, or at Ramat Shlomo northwest of the Old City. Most of them weigh between each, but others weigh even more, with one extraordinary stone located slightly north of Wilson&#x27;s Arch measuring long, high, approximately deep, and weighing between . Each of these ashlars is framed by fine-chiseled borders. The margins themselves measure between wide, with their depth measuring . In the Herodian period, the upper of wall were thick and served as the outer wall of the double colonnade of the Temple platform. This upper section was decorated with pilasters, the remainder of which were destroyed when the Byzantines reconquered Jerusalem from the Persians in 628.

The next four courses, consisting of smaller plainly dressed stones, are Umayyad work (8th century, Early Muslim period). Above that are 16 to 17 courses of small stones from the Mamluk period (13th–16th centuries) and later.

==History==

===Construction and destruction (19 BCE–70 CE)===
According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon&#x27;s Temple was built atop what is known as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today&#x27;s Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod&#x27;s death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod&#x27;s building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod&#x27;s great-grandson. Given Josephus&#x27; information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading up to it could not have been completed during Herod&#x27;s lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.

Herod&#x27;s Temple was destroyed by the Romans, along with the rest of Jerusalem, in 70 CE, during the First Jewish–Roman War.

===Late Roman and Byzantine periods (135–638)===
During much of the 2nd–5th centuries of the Common Era, after the Roman defeat of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem. There is some evidence that Roman emperors in the 2nd and 3rd centuries did permit them to visit the city to worship on the Mount of Olives and sometimes on the Temple Mount itself. When the empire started becoming Christian under Constantine I, they were given permission to enter the city once a year, on the Tisha B&#x27;Av, to lament the loss of the Temple at the wall. The Bordeaux Pilgrim, who wrote in 333 CE, suggests that it was probably to the perforated stone or the Rock of Moriah, &quot;to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart&quot;.This was because an imperial decree from Rome barred Jews from living in Jerusalem. Just once per year they were permitted to return and bitterly grieve about the fate of their people. Comparable accounts survive, including those by the Church Father, Gregory of Nazianzus (c. 329–390) and by Jerome in his commentary to Zephaniah written in 392 CE. In the 4th century, Christian sources reveal that the Jews encountered great difficulty in buying the right to pray near the Western Wall, at least on the 9th of Av. In 425 CE, the Jews of the Galilee wrote to Byzantine empress Aelia Eudocia seeking permission to pray by the ruins of the Temple. Permission was granted and they were officially permitted to resettle in Jerusalem.

====Archaeology====
Discovery of underground rooms that could have been used as food storage carved out of the bedrock under the 1,400-year-old mosaic floor of Byzantine structure was announced by Israel Antiquities Authority in May in 2020.

&quot;At first we were very disappointed because we found we hit the bedrock, meaning that the material culture, the human activity here in Jerusalem ended. What we found here was a rock-cut system—three rooms, all hewn in the bedrock of ancient Jerusalem&quot; said co-director of the excavation Barak Monnickendam-Givon.

===Early Muslim to Mamluk period (638–1517)===
Several Jewish authors of the 10th and 11th centuries write about the Jews resorting to the Western Wall for devotional purposes. Ahimaaz relates that Samuel ben Paltiel (980–1010) gave money for oil at &quot;the sanctuary at the Western Wall.&quot; Benjamin of Tudela (1170) wrote &quot;In front of this place is the western wall, which is one of the walls of the Holy of Holies. This is called the Gate of Mercy, and hither come all the Jews to pray before the Wall in the open court.&quot; The account gave rise to confusion about the actual location of Jewish worship, and some suggest that Benjamin in fact referred to the Eastern Wall along with its Gate of Mercy. While Nahmanides (d. 1270) did not mention a synagogue near the Western Wall in his detailed account of the temple site, shortly before the Crusader period a synagogue existed at the site. Obadiah of Bertinoro (1488) states &quot;the Western Wall, part of which is still standing, is made of great, thick stones, larger than any I have seen in buildings of antiquity in Rome or in other lands.&quot;

Shortly after Saladin&#x27;s 1187 siege of the city, in 1193, the sultan&#x27;s son and successor al-Afdal established the land adjacent to the wall as a charitable trust (&quot;waqf&quot;). The largest part of it was named after an important mystic, Abu Madyan Shu&#x27;aib. The Abu Madyan waqf was dedicated to Maghrebian pilgrims and scholars who had taken up residence there, and houses were built only metres away from the wall, from which they were thus separated by just a narrow passageway, some wide.

The first likely mention of the Islamic tradition that Buraq was tethered at the site is from the 14th century. A manuscript by Ibrahim b. Ishaq al-Ansari (known as Ibn Furkah, d. 1328) refers to Bab al-Nabi (lit. &quot;Gate of the Prophet&quot;), an old name for Barclay&#x27;s Gate below the Maghrebi Gate. Charles D. Matthews however, who edited al-Firkah&#x27;s work, notes that other statements of al-Firkah might seem to point to the Double Gate in the southern wall.

===Ottoman period (1517–1917)===
In 1517, the Turkish Ottomans under Selim I conquered Jerusalem from the Mamluks who had held it since 1250. Selim&#x27;s son, Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, ordered the construction of an imposing wall to be built around the entire city, which still stands today. Various folktales relate Suleiman&#x27;s quest to locate the Temple site and his order to have the area &quot;swept and sprinkled, and the Western Wall washed with rosewater&quot; upon its discovery. According to a legend cited by Moses Hagiz, Jews received official permission to worship at the site and Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan built an oratory for them there, but, as of Purim 1625, Jews were banned from praying on the Temple Mount and only sometimes dared to pray at the Western Wall, for which purpose a special liturgy had been arranged. Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who lived in Jerusalem from 1700 to 1706, reports that Jews then had access to the wall and would pray there as often as possible.

Over the centuries, land close to the Wall became built up. Public access to the Wall was through the Moroccan Quarter, a labyrinth of narrow alleyways. In May 1840 a firman issued by Ibrahim Pasha forbade the Jews to pave the passageway in front of the Wall. It also cautioned them against &quot;raising their voices and displaying their books there.&quot; They were, however, allowed &quot;to pay visits to it as of old.&quot;

 writing in the mid-19th century records:

This wall is visited by all our brothers on every feast and festival; and the large space at its foot is often so densely filled up, that all cannot perform their devotions here at the same time. It is also visited, though by less numbers, on every Friday afternoon, and by some nearly every day. No one is molested in these visits by the Mahomedans, as we have a very old firman from the Sultan of Constantinople that the approach shall not be denied to us, though the Porte obtains for this privilege a special tax, which is, however, quite insignificant.

Over time the increased numbers of people gathering at the site resulted in tensions between the Jewish visitors who wanted easier access and more space, and the residents, who complained of the noise. This gave rise to Jewish attempts at gaining ownership of the land adjacent to the Wall.
In the late 1830s a wealthy Jew named Shemarya Luria attempted to purchase houses near the Wall, but was unsuccessful, as was Jewish sage Abdullah of Bombay who tried to purchase the Western Wall in the 1850s. In 1869 Rabbi Hillel Moshe Gelbstein settled in Jerusalem. He arranged that benches and tables be brought to the Wall on a daily basis for the study groups he organised and the minyan which he led there for years. He also formulated a plan whereby some of the courtyards facing the Wall would be acquired, with the intention of establishing three synagogues—one each for the Sephardim, the Hasidim and the Perushim. He also endeavoured to re-establish an ancient practice of &quot;guards of honour&quot;, which according to the mishnah in Middot, were positioned around the Temple Mount. He rented a house near the Wall and paid men to stand guard there and at various other gateways around the mount. However, this set-up lasted only for a short time due to lack of funds or because of Arab resentment. In 1874, Mordechai Rosanes paid for the repaving of the alleyway adjacent to the wall.

In 1887 Baron Rothschild conceived a plan to purchase and demolish the Moroccan Quarter as &quot;a merit and honor to the Jewish People.&quot; The proposed purchase was considered and approved by the Ottoman Governor of Jerusalem, Rauf Pasha, and by the Mufti of Jerusalem, Mohammed Tahir Husseini. Even after permission was obtained from the highest secular and Muslim religious authority to proceed, the transaction was shelved after the authorities insisted that after demolishing the quarter no construction of any type could take place there, only trees could be planted to beautify the area. Additionally the Jews would not have full control over the area. This meant that they would have no power to stop people from using the plaza for various activities, including the driving of mules, which would cause a disturbance to worshippers. Other reports place the scheme&#x27;s failure on Jewish infighting as to whether the plan would foster a detrimental Arab reaction.
In 1895 Hebrew linguist and publisher Rabbi Chaim Hirschensohn became entangled in a failed effort to purchase the Western Wall and lost all his assets. The attempts of the Palestine Land Development Company to purchase the environs of the Western Wall for the Jews just before the outbreak of World War I also never came to fruition. In the first two months following the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s entry into the First World War, the Turkish governor of Jerusalem, Zakey Bey, offered to sell the Moroccan Quarter, which consisted of about 25 houses, to the Jews in order to enlarge the area available to them for prayer. He requested a sum of £20,000 which would be used to both rehouse the Muslim families and to create a public garden in front of the Wall. However, the Jews of the city lacked the necessary funds. A few months later, under Muslim Arab pressure on the Turkish authorities in Jerusalem, Jews became forbidden by official decree to place benches and light candles at the Wall. This sour turn in relations was taken up by the Chacham Bashi who managed to get the ban overturned. In 1915 it was reported that Djemal Pasha, closed off the wall to visitation as a sanitary measure. Probably meant was the &quot;Great&quot;, rather than the &quot;Small&quot; Djemal Pasha.

Decrees (&quot;firman&quot;)s issued regarding the Wall:
:* These firmans were cited by the Jewish contingent at the International Commission, 1930, as proof for rights at the Wall. Muslim authorities responded by arguing that historic sanctions of Jewish presence were acts of tolerance shown by Muslims, who, by doing so, did not concede any positive rights.

===British rule (1917–48)===

In December 1917, Allied forces under Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem from the Turks. Allenby pledged &quot;that every sacred building, monument, holy spot, shrine, traditional site, endowment, pious bequest, or customary place of prayer of whatsoever form of the three religions will be maintained and protected according to the existing customs and beliefs of those to whose faith they are sacred&quot;.

In 1919 Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann approached the British Military Governor of Jerusalem, Colonel Sir Ronald Storrs, and offered between £75,000 and £100,000 (approx. £5m in modern terms) to purchase the area at the foot of the Wall and rehouse the occupants. Storrs was enthusiastic about the idea because he hoped some of the money would be used to improve Muslim education. Although they appeared promising at first, negotiations broke down after strong Muslim opposition. Storrs wrote two decades later:
The acceptance of the proposals, had it been practicable, would have obviated years of wretched humiliations, including the befouling of the Wall and pavement and the unmannerly braying of the tragi-comic Arab band during Jewish prayer, and culminating in the horrible outrages of 1929.

In early 1920, the first Jewish-Arab dispute over the Wall occurred when the Muslim authorities were carrying out minor repair works to the Wall&#x27;s upper courses. The Jews, while agreeing that the works were necessary, appealed to the British that they be made under supervision of the newly formed Department of Antiquities, because the Wall was an ancient relic.

According to Hillel Halkin, in the 1920s, among rising tensions with the Jews regarding the wall, the Arabs ceased using the more traditional name El-Mabka, &quot;the Place of Weeping&quot;, which related to Jewish practices, and replaced it with El-Burak, a name with Muslim connotations.

In 1926 an effort was made to lease the Maghrebi &quot;waqf&quot;, which included the wall, with the plan of eventually buying it. Negotiations were begun in secret by the Jewish judge Gad Frumkin, with financial backing from American millionaire Nathan Straus. The chairman of the Palestine Zionist Executive, Colonel F. H. Kisch, explained that the aim was &quot;quietly to evacuate the Moroccan occupants of those houses which it would later be necessary to demolish&quot; to create an open space with seats for aged worshippers to sit on. However, Straus withdrew when the price became excessive and the plan came to nothing. The Va&#x27;ad Leumi, against the advice of the Palestine Zionist Executive, demanded that the British expropriate the wall and give it to the Jews, but the British refused.

In 1928 the World Zionist Organization reported that John Chancellor, High Commissioner of Palestine, believed that the Western Wall should come under Jewish control and wondered &quot;why no great Jewish philanthropist had not bought it yet&quot;.

====September 1928 disturbances====
In 1922, a Status Quo agreement issued by the mandatory authority forbade the placing of benches or chairs near the Wall. The last occurrence of such a ban was in 1915, but the Ottoman decree was soon retracted after intervention of the Chacham Bashi. In 1928 the District Commissioner of Jerusalem, Edward Keith-Roach, acceded to an Arab request to implement the ban. This led to a British officer being stationed at the Wall making sure that Jews were prevented from sitting. Nor were Jews permitted to separate the sexes with a screen. In practice, a flexible modus vivendi had emerged and such screens had been put up from time to time when large numbers of people gathered to pray.
On September 24, 1928, the Day of Atonement, British police resorted to removing by force a screen used to separate men and women at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken wooden frame as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, the Chief Rabbi of the Haredi Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter on behalf of his community, the Edah HaChareidis and Agudas Yisroel, strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed Douglas Valder Duff, the British officer involved, was sheltering.

Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach described the screen as violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Masjid Al-Aqsa. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that the removal of the screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.

A widespread Arab campaign to protest against presumed Jewish intentions and designs to take possession of the Al Aqsa Mosque swept the country and a &quot;Society for the Protection of the Muslim Holy Places&quot; was established. The Jewish National Council (Vaad Leumi) responding to these Arab fears declared in a statement that &quot;We herewith declare emphatically and sincerely that no Jew has ever thought of encroaching upon the rights of Moslems over their own Holy places, but our Arab brethren should also recognise the rights of Jews in regard to the places in Palestine which are holy to them.&quot; The committee also demanded that the British administration expropriate the wall for the Jews.

From October 1928 onward, Mufti Amin al-Husayni organised a series of measures to demonstrate the Arabs&#x27; exclusive claims to the Temple Mount and its environs. He ordered new construction next to and above the Western Wall. The British granted the Arabs permission to convert a building adjoining the Wall into a mosque and to add a minaret. A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer and Sufi rites directly next to the Wall. These were seen as a provocation by the Jews who prayed at the Wall. The Jews protested and tensions increased.

A British inquiry into the disturbances and investigation regarding the principal issue in the Western Wall dispute, namely the rights of the Jewish worshipers to bring appurtenances to the wall, was convened. The Supreme Muslim Council provided documents dating from the Turkish regime supporting their claims. However, repeated reminders to the Chief Rabbinate to verify which apparatus had been permitted failed to elicit any response. They refused to do so, arguing that Jews had the right to pray at the Wall without restrictions. Subsequently, in November 1928, the Government issued a White Paper entitled &quot;The Western or Wailing Wall in Jerusalem: Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies&quot;, which emphasised the maintenance of the &quot;status quo&quot; and instructed that Jews could only bring &quot;those accessories which had been permitted in Turkish times.&quot;

A few months later, Haj Amin complained to Chancellor that &quot;Jews were bringing benches and tables in increased numbers to the wall and driving nails into the wall and hanging lamps on them.&quot;

====1929 Palestine riots====
In the summer of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the southern end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.

On August 14, 1929, after attacks on individual Jews praying at the Wall, 6,000 Jews demonstrated in Tel Aviv, shouting &quot;The Wall is ours.&quot; The next day, the Jewish fast of Tisha B&#x27;Av, 300 youths raised the Zionist flag and sang Hatikva at the Wall. The day after, on August 16, an organized mob of 2,000 Muslim Arabs descended on the Western Wall, injuring the beadle and burning prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town, and was followed a few days later by the Hebron massacre.
One hundred and thirty-three Jews were killed and 339 injured in the Arab riots, and in the subsequent process of quelling the riots 110 Arabs were killed by British police. This was by far the deadliest attack on Jews during the period of British Rule over Palestine.

====1930 international commission====

In 1930, in response to the 1929 riots, the British Government appointed a commission &quot;to determine the rights and claims of Muslims and Jews in connection with the Western or Wailing Wall&quot;, and to determine the causes of the violence and prevent it in the future. The League of Nations approved the commission on condition that the members were not British.

The Commission noted that &quot;the Jews do not claim any proprietorship to the Wall or to the Pavement in front of it (concluding speech of Jewish Counsel, Minutes, page 908).&quot;
The Commission concluded that the wall, and the adjacent pavement and Moroccan Quarter, were solely owned by the Muslim &quot;waqf&quot;. However, Jews had the right to &quot;free access to the Western Wall for the purpose of devotions at all times&quot;, subject to some stipulations that limited which objects could be brought to the Wall and forbade the blowing of the shofar, which was made illegal. Muslims were forbidden to disrupt Jewish devotions by driving animals or other means.

The recommendations of the Commission were brought into law by the Palestine (Western or Wailing Wall) Order in Council, 1931, which came into effect on June 8, 1931. Persons violating the law were liable to a fine of 50 pounds or imprisonment up to 6 months, or both.

During the 1930s, at the conclusion of Yom Kippur, young Jews persistently flouted the shofar ban each year and blew the shofar resulting in their arrest and prosecution. They were usually fined or sentenced to imprisonment for three to six months. The Shaw commission determined that the violence occurred due to &quot;racial animosity on the part of the Arabs, consequent upon the disappointment of their political and national aspirations and fear for their economic future.&quot;

===Jordanian rule (1948–67)===
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the Old City together with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement called for a Special Committee to make arrangements for (amongst other things) &quot;free access to the Holy Places and cultural institutions and use of the cemetery on the Mount of Olives&quot;. The committee sat multiple times during 1949, but both sides made additional demands and at the same time the Palestine Conciliation Commission was pressing for the internationalization of Jerusalem against the wishes of both parties. No agreement was ever reached, leading to recriminations in both directions. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.
An exception was made for Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which was not an option for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.

====&quot;Al Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd&quot; sign====
During the Jordanian rule of the Old City, a ceramic street sign in Arabic and English was affixed to the stones of the ancient wall. Attached up, it was made up of eight separate ceramic tiles and said &quot;Al Buraq Road&quot; in Arabic at the top with the English &quot;Al-Buraq (Wailing Wall) Rd&quot; below. When Israeli soldiers arrived at the wall in June 1967, one attempted to scrawl Hebrew lettering on it. &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported that on June 8, Ben-Gurion went to the wall and &quot;looked with distaste&quot; at the road sign; &quot;this is not right, it should come down&quot; and he proceeded to dismantle it.
This act signaled the climax of the capture of the Old City and the ability of Jews to once again access their holiest sites. Emotional recollections of this event are related by David Ben-Gurion and Shimon Peres.

===First years under Israeli rule (1967–69)===
====Declarations after the conquest====
Following Israel&#x27;s victory during the 1967 Six-Day War, the Western Wall came under Israeli control. Brigadier Rabbi Shlomo Goren proclaimed after its capture that &quot;Israel would never again relinquish the Wall&quot;, a stance supported by Israeli Minister for Defence Moshe Dayan and Chief of Staff General Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin described the moment Israeli soldiers reached the Wall:

&quot;There was one moment in the Six-Day War which symbolized the great victory: that was the moment in which the first paratroopers—under Gur&#x27;s command—reached the stones of the Western Wall, feeling the emotion of the place; there never was, and never will be, another moment like it. Nobody staged that moment. Nobody planned it in advance. Nobody prepared it and nobody was prepared for it; it was as if Providence had directed the whole thing: the paratroopers weeping—loudly and in pain—over their comrades who had fallen along the way, the words of the Kaddish prayer heard by Western Wall&#x27;s stones after 19 years of silence, tears of mourning, shouts of joy, and the singing of &quot;Hatikvah&quot;&quot;.

====Demolition of the Moroccan Quarter====
Forty-eight hours after capturing the wall, the military, without explicit government order, hastily proceeded to demolish the entire Moroccan Quarter, which stood from the Wall. The Sheikh Eid Mosque, built on the site of one of Jerusalem&#x27;s earliest Islamic schools (the &quot;Afdiliyyah&quot;), was pulled down to make way for the plaza. 106 Arab families consisting of 650 people were ordered to leave their homes at night. When they refused, bulldozers began to demolish the buildings with people still inside, killing one person and injuring a number of others.

According to Eyal Weizman, Chaim Herzog, who later became Israel&#x27;s sixth president, took much of the credit for the destruction of the neighbourhood:

When we visited the Wailing Wall we found a toilet attached to it ... we decided to remove it and from this we came to the conclusion that we could evacuate the entire area in front of the Wailing Wall ... a historical opportunity that will never return ... We knew that the following Saturday [sic Wednesday], June 14, would be the Jewish festival of Shavuot and that many will want to come to pray ... it all had to be completed by then.

The narrow pavement, which could accommodate a maximum of 12,000 per day, was transformed into an enormous plaza that could hold in excess of 400,000.
Several months later, the pavement close to the wall was excavated to a depth of two and half metres, exposing an additional two courses of large stones.

A complex of buildings against the wall at the southern end of the plaza, that included Madrasa Fakhriya and the house that the Abu al-Sa&#x27;ud family had occupied since the 16th century, were spared in the 1967 destruction, but demolished in 1969. The section of the wall dedicated to prayers was thus extended southwards to double its original length, from , while the space facing the wall grew to .

The narrow, approximately pre-1948 alley along the wall, used for Jewish prayer, was enlarged to , with the entire Western Wall Plaza covering , stretching from the wall to the Jewish Quarter.

==Plaza==
The new plaza created in 1967 is used for worship and public gatherings, including Bar mitzvah celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the wall on the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of Tisha B&#x27;Av, which marks the destruction of the Temple and on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.

In November 2010, the government approved a NIS 85m ($23m) scheme to improve access from the Jewish Quarter and upgrade infrastructure at the Wall.

===Orthodox rules===
Conflicts over prayer at the national monument began a little more than a year after Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War, which again made the site accessible to Jews. In July 1968 the World Union for Progressive Judaism, which had planned the group&#x27;s international convention in Jerusalem, appealed to the Knesset after the Ministry of Religious Affairs prohibited the organization from hosting mixed-gender services at the Wall. The Knesset committee on internal affairs backed the Ministry of Religious Affairs in disallowing the Jewish convention attendees, who had come from over 24 countries, from worshiping in their fashion. The Orthodox held that services at the Wall should follow traditional Jewish law for segregated seating followed in synagogues, while the non-Orthodox perspective was that &quot;the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.&quot;

==Wilson&#x27;s Arch area==
===Archaeology===
===Transformation into worship area===
In September 1983, U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain, Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was under Israeli control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.

In 2005, the Western Wall Heritage Foundation initiated a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch. Its goal was to renovate and restructure the area within Wilson&#x27;s Arch, the covered area to the left of worshipers facing the Wall in the open prayer plaza, in order to increase access for visitors and for prayer.

The restoration of the men&#x27;s section included a Torah ark that can house over 100 Torah scrolls, in addition to new bookshelves, a library, heating for the winter, and air conditioning for the summer. A new room was also built for the scribes who maintain and preserve the Torah scrolls used at the Wall. New construction also included a women&#x27;s section, overlooking the men&#x27;s prayer area, so that women could use this separate area to &quot;take part in the services held inside under the Arch&quot; for the first time.

On July 25, 2010, a &quot;ner tamid&quot;, an oil-burning &quot;eternal light,&quot; was installed within the prayer hall within Wilson&#x27;s Arch, the first eternal light installed in the area of the Western Wall. According to the Western Wall Heritage Foundation, requests had been made for many years that &quot;an olive oil lamp be placed in the prayer hall of the Western Wall Plaza, as is the custom in Jewish synagogues, to represent the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem as well as the continuously burning fire on the altar of burnt offerings in front of the Temple,&quot; especially in the closest place to those ancient flames.
A number of special worship events have been held since the renovation. They have taken advantage of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security.

==Robinson&#x27;s Arch area==
===Archaeology===

At the southern end of the Western Wall, Robinson&#x27;s Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount.

The so-called Isaiah Stone, located under Robinson&#x27;s Arch, has a carved inscription in Hebrew with a partial and slightly faulty quote from (or paraphrase of) : &quot;And you will see and your heart will rejoice and &quot;their&quot; bones like an herb [will flourish]&quot; (the correct line from Isaiah would read &quot;...&quot;your&quot; bones&quot;.) This gave room to various interpretations, some speculating about it being written during a period of hope for Jews. Alternatively, it might be connected to nearby graves. The inscription has tentatively been dated to the 4th-8th century, some extending the possible timespan all the way to the 11th century.
===Non-Orthodox worship area===

Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi of the Western Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs in the major men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s prayer areas against the Wall. The worship site was inaugurated in 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall. A platform has been added in 2013 in order to expand the prayer area.

==In Judaism==
===History as place of prayer===
Jews were banned from Jerusalem by the Roman authorities after the Second Jewish revolt (2nd century CE) and, although there are intermittent accounts of limited 9th of Av services on the Temple Mount, no sources from before the 7th-century Islamic conquest attest to any other Jewish services allowed near the Mount and many report that none were permitted. Sources conflict with regard to the Mount&#x27;s status under Islamic rule, but Karaite commentator Salmon ben Jeroham ( CE) reports that Jews were initially granted wide access to the Mount, then restricted to gathering near &quot;one of its gates&quot;, then banned entirely before his own time.

====10th–12th centuries====
However, a synagogue was apparently founded by the Western Wall (in the broader sense) shortly after the time of Salmon. The Scroll of Ahimaaz, a historical chronicle written in 1050 CE, describes:Samuel his son arose to replace [Paltiel], and this great man filled his father&#x27;s place [in CE] ... [He] dedicated 20,000 golden drachmas to the One Who Dwells on High, to entreat the favor of the Rider of Clouds. These were alms for the poor...; oil for the synagogue in the western wall, for [the lamps on] its &quot;bema&quot; ...This account of Jewish prayer at the edge of the Mount in confirmed by Daniel ben Azariah, who writes ( CE) that Jews were then permitted to &quot;pray near the Mount&#x27;s gates&quot;.

In 1099 CE the Crusader army captured Jerusalem, killing almost every Jew inside, and banned Jewish pilgrims from approaching the Mount. In his &quot;Scroll of Revelation&quot; ( CE), Abraham bar Hiyya records that:... the Romans who destroyed the Temple in the days of the evil Titus, though they despoiled its sanctuary, never claimed any ownership of the holy Mount or any need to pray there. But ever since the evil Constantine converted to Christianity, they have begun to make these claims ... Since [1099 CE] the Christians have desecrated the Mount, made the citadel their church, brought their idols within it, and prevented Jews from praying there. Ever since those villains took over the Mount, no Jew has been allowed to enter it, and none are to be found in all Jerusalem.

In another reversal by CE, during the later Crusader period, the Western Wall was reopened to Jewish prayer. Benjamin of Tudela attests:. . . and the Gate of Jehoshaphat, which faced the Temple in ancient times. There is the &quot;Templi Domini,&quot; which is the site of the Temple, and on it is a large and very beautiful dome built by Umar bin al-Khataab. Although they come to pray, the gentiles do not bring any images or effigies onto the site. And in front of this place is the western wall, which was one of the walls in the Holy of Holies; this is called the Gate of Mercy and hither come all the Jews to pray before the wall in the courtyard.

====17th century====
In 1625, David Finzi reported to the Jewish leadership of Carpi that:. . . from there we went up to the Temple Mount, passing mundane structures until we reached the peak of the Mount, where once the Temple stood, which was destroyed for our sins. Now a mosque is built upon it, and Jews are prohibited from entering it; only outside it, near the Western Wall, are Jews allowed to gather, and even this only in peaceful times—in difficult times, such as these, the Jewish community has decreed that no one go there.

But in the first week of our visit, before this decree, we went all the way in, and kissed it, and I prostrated myself before its base, and there I said the ordered prayers, and also entreated God to bless all the Jews of Carpi ... Though it is called the Western Wall, nothing of the Temple whatever survived the destruction, the looting by thieves, and the construction of the mosque. They built a citadel on the site of the Foundation Stone, surpassingly lovely ...Tensions eventually calmed again. Gedaliah of Siemiatycze, who lived in Jerusalem from 1700 to 1706, records that:Only Muslims are permitted to enter the Mount and not Jews or other peoples, unless they convert to the Muslim faith. They say that not just any faith is worthy of the Mount, and they continually remind us that the Muslims have superseded the Jews in the eyes of God. When we go to pray at the Wall, we press right up against it, like the lover in Song of Songs who &quot;standeth behind our wall&quot;. On the eve of the New Moon, on Tisha ba&#x27;Av, and on other fast days, we go there to pray, and the women to raise their plangent cries, but no one challenges us, and even the &quot;qadi&quot; who lives there does not object. Though the Arab youths sometimes come to prey on us, they are easily bribed to leave us alone, and if caught by their own elders they are rebuked ... Prayer by the Wall usually meets with God&#x27;s favor ... . Once in olden times, or so I heard, there was a terrible drought. The Jews declared a day of fasting, and they went with a Torah scroll to the Western Wall to pray, and God answered their prayers so readily that they had to wrap the scroll in their clothes on their return to the synagogue. Every Sabbath morning, after the services at the synagogue, we immediately set off for the Western Wall ... every single one of us, Ashkenazic and Sephardic, old and young ... there we recite those Psalms that mention Jerusalem, and &quot;Pitom haQtores&quot;, and &quot;Aleinu l&#x27;Shabeach&quot;, and the Kaddish, and we bless those in the diaspora who fundraise for Eretz Yisrael ... .

====18th–19th centuries====
 The writings of various travellers in the Holy Land, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, tell of how the Wall and its environs continued to be a place of devotion for the Jews. Isaac Yahuda, a prominent member of the Sephardic community in Jerusalem recalled how men and women used to gather in a circle at the Wall to hear sermons delivered in Ladino. His great-grandmother, who arrived in Palestine in 1841, &quot;used to go to the Western Wall every Friday afternoon, winter and summer, and stay there until candle-lighting time, reading the entire Book of Psalms and the Song of Songs...she would sit there by herself for hours.&quot;

====20th–21st centuries====
In the past women could be found sitting at the entrance to the Wall every Sabbath holding fragrant herbs and spices in order to enable worshipers to make additional blessings. In the hot weather they would provide cool water. The women also used to cast lots for the privilege of sweeping and washing the alleyway at the foot of the Wall.

Throughout several centuries, the Wall is where Jews have gathered to express gratitude to God or to pray for divine mercy. On news of the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944 thousands of Jews went to the Wall to offer prayers for the &quot;success of His Majesty&#x27;s and Allied Forces in the liberation of all enemy-occupied territory.&quot; On October 13, 1994, 50,000 gathered to pray for the safe return of kidnapped soldier Nachshon Wachsman. August 10, 2005 saw a massive prayer rally at the Wall. Estimates of people protesting Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement plan ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 people. Every year on Tisha B&#x27;Av large crowds congregate at the Wall to commemorate the destruction of the Temple. In 2007 over 100,000 gathered. During the month of Tishrei 2009, a record 1.5 million people visited the site.

===Relation to the Foundation Stone===
In Judaism, the Western Wall is venerated as the sole remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the &quot;Even ha-shetiya&quot; or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.

===Part of the Temple proper===
Rabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical King Solomon from the time of the First Temple.

Some medieval rabbis claimed that today&#x27;s Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount&#x27;s Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.

===Divine custody===
A 7th-century Midrash refers to a western wall of the Temple which &quot;would never be destroyed&quot;, and a 6th-century Midrash mentions how Rome was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.

===Divine Presence===
An 11th-century Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: &quot;Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall&quot;, and the Zohar (13th century) similarly writes that &quot;the Divine Presence rests upon the Western Wall&quot;.

Eighteenth-century scholar Jonathan Eybeschutz writes that &quot;after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour&quot;. It is told that great Jewish sages, including Isaac Luria and the Radvaz, experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.

===Kabbalah of the word &quot;kotel&quot;===
Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word &quot;kotel&quot; when discussing the significance of praying against a wall. He cites the Zohar which writes that the word &quot;kotel&quot;, meaning wall, is made up of two parts: &quot;Ko&quot;, which has the numerical value of God&#x27;s name, and &quot;Tel&quot;, meaning mount, which refers to the Temple and its Western Wall.

===Ritual===
====Status as a synagogue====
Many contemporary Orthodox scholars rule that the area in front of the Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall to show its sanctity. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.

====Contact with the Wall====
Some Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against inserting fingers into the cracks of the Wall as they believe that the breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.

In the past, some visitors would write their names on the Wall, or based upon various scriptural verses, would drive nails into the crevices. These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall. Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long responsa appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper &quot;Havatzelet&quot; in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration. More recently the &quot;Yalkut Yosef&quot; rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness. Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a halachic point of view. Blasphemous graffiti once sprayed by a tourist was left visible for months until it began to peel away.

====Barefoot approach====
There was once an old custom of removing one&#x27;s shoes upon approaching the Wall. A 17th-century collection of special prayers to be said at holy places mentions that &quot;upon coming to the Western Wall one should remove his shoes, bow and recite...&quot;. Rabbi Moses Reicher wrote that &quot;it is a good and praiseworthy custom to approach the Western Wall in white garments after ablution, kneel and prostrate oneself in submission and recite &quot;This is nothing other than the House of God and here is the gate of Heaven.&quot; When within four cubits of the Wall, one should remove their footwear.&quot; Over the years the custom of standing barefoot at the Wall has ceased, as there is no need to remove one&#x27;s shoes when standing by the Wall, because the plaza area is outside the sanctified precinct of the Temple Mount.

====Mourning over the Temple&#x27;s destruction====
According to Jewish Law, one is obliged to grieve and rend one&#x27;s garment upon visiting the Western Wall and seeing the desolate site of the Temple. Bach (17th century) instructs that &quot;when one sees the Gates of Mercy which are situated in the Western Wall, which is the wall King David built, he should recite: Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the nations: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the Lord&quot;. Some scholars write that rending one&#x27;s garments is not applicable nowadays as Jerusalem is under Jewish control. Others disagree, pointing to the fact that the Temple Mount is controlled by the Muslim &quot;waqf&quot; and that the mosques which sit upon the Temple site should increase feelings of distress. If one hasn&#x27;t seen the Wall for over 30 days, the prevailing custom is to rend one&#x27;s garments, but this can be avoided if one visits on the Sabbath or on festivals. According to Donneal Epstein, a person who has not seen the Wall within the last 30 days should recite: &quot;Our Holy Temple, which was our glory, in which our forefathers praised You, was burned and all of our delights were destroyed&quot;.

====Significance as place of prayer====
The Sages of the Talmud stated that anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, &quot;it is as if he has prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is situated there and it is open to hear prayer.&quot; Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God&#x27;s bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger (1798–1871) writes, making reference to a medieval rabbi, &quot;since the Theology and ritual Israel&#x27;s prayers ascend on high there... as one of the great ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall.&quot; A well-known &quot;segula&quot; (efficacious remedy) for finding one&#x27;s soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher (1928–2003).

====Egalitarian and non-Orthodox prayer====
While during the late 19th century, no formal segregation of men and women was to be found at the Wall, conflict erupted in July 1968 when members of the World Union for Progressive Judaism were denied the right to host a mixed-gender service at the site after the Ministry of Religious Affairs insisted on maintaining the gender segregation customary at Orthodox places of worship. The progressives responded by claiming that &quot;the Wall is a shrine of all Jews, not one particular branch of Judaism.&quot;

In 1988, the small but vocal group called Women of the Wall launched a campaign for recognition of non-Orthodox prayer at the Wall. Their form and manner of prayer elicited a violent response from some Orthodox worshippers and they were subsequently banned from holding services at the site. After repeated attacks by haredim, in 1989 the Women of the Wall petitioned to secure the right of women to pray at the wall without restrictions.

A decade on, some commentators called for the closure of the Wall unless an acceptable solution to the controversy was found.

In 2003 Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld the ban on non-Orthodox worship at the Wall, disallowing any women from reading publicly from the Torah or wearing traditional prayer shawls at the plaza itself, but instructed the Israeli government to prepare the site of Robinson&#x27;s Arch to host such events, given that this area does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The government responded by allocating Robinson&#x27;s Arch for such purposes.

The Robinson&#x27;s Arch worship site was inaugurated in August 2004 and has since hosted services by Reform and Conservative groups, as well as services by the Women of the Wall.

In 2012, critics still complained about the restrictions at the Western Wall, saying Israel had &quot;turned a national monument into an ultra-Orthodox synagogue.&quot;

In April 2013 things came to a head. In response to the repeated arrest of women, including Anat Hoffman, found flouting the law, the Jewish Agency observed &#x27;the urgent need to reach a permanent solution and make the Western Wall once again a symbol of unity among the Jewish people, and not one of discord and strife.&quot; Jewish Agency leader Natan Sharansky spearheaded a concept that would expand and renovate the Robinson&#x27;s Arch area into an area where people may &quot;perform worship rituals not based on the Orthodox interpretation of Jewish tradition.&quot; The Jerusalem District Court ruled that as long as there was no other appropriate area for pluralistic prayer, prayer according to non-Orthodox custom should be allowed at the Wall, and a judge ruled that the 2003 Israeli Supreme Court ruling prohibiting women from carrying a Torah or wearing prayer shawls had been misinterpreted and that Women of the Wall prayer gatherings at the Wall should not be deemed as disturbing the public order.

On August 25, 2013, a new 4,480 square foot prayer platform named &quot;Ezrat Yisrael Plaza&quot; was completed as part of this plan of facilitating non-Orthodox worship, with access to the platform at all hours, even when the rest of the area&#x27;s archaeological park is closed to visitors. After some controversy regarding the question of authority over this prayer area, the announcement was made that it would come under the authority of a future government-appointed &quot;pluralist council&quot; that would include non-Orthodox representatives.

In January 2016, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to designate a new space at the Kotel that would be available for egalitarian prayer and that would not be controlled by the Rabbinate. Women of the Wall welcomed the decision, although Sephardic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar of Jerusalem said creating a mixed-gender prayer section was paramount to destroying the Wall. The Chief Rabbinate said it would create an alternate plan. In June 2017, it was announced that the plan approved in January 2016 had been suspended.

====Prayer notes====

There is a much publicised practice of placing slips of paper containing written prayers into the crevices of the Wall. The earliest account of this practice describes Chaim ibn Attar (d. 1743) writing an amulet for a petitioner and instructing him to place it inside the wall. More than a million notes are placed each year and the opportunity to e-mail notes is offered by a number of organisations. It has become customary for visiting dignitaries to place notes too.

====Chabad tefillin stand====
Shortly after the Western Wall came under Israeli control in 1967, a stand of the Chabad movement offering phylacteries (&quot;tefillin&quot;) was erected with permission from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers male visitors the chance to put on &quot;tefillin&quot;, a daily Jewish prayer ritual. In the months following the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at the stand. The stand is staffed by multilingual Chabad volunteers and an estimated 100,000 male visitors put on tefillin there annually.

==In Islam==
===Tradition of the place of tethering===
Muslim reverence for the site is derived from the belief that the Islamic prophet Muhammad tied his winged mount Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been suggested for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq Mosque, which is just inside the wall at the south end of the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay&#x27;s Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi Gate.

There are four different locations, along the southern, eastern, and western wall, with gates known successively or simultaneously as the Gate of the Prophet and al-Buraq.

====Early Muslim vs. Mamluk-period traditions====
US scholar Charles D. Matthews wrote in 1932 that, based on the work of Muslim authors of the 10th to 11th centuries (the later part of the Early Muslim period), the place where Prophet Muhammad had tethered Buraq and entered the &quot;haram&quot; was considered at the time to be the Double Gate of the Temple Mount&#x27;s southern wall. To reach this conclusion, which he shares with Charles Wilson and Guy Le Strange, he analysed the relevant texts by Ibn al-Faqih (903), Ibn Abd Rabbih (913), and mainly by Muqaddasi (985) and Nasir-i-Khusrau (1047). One of the earliest authors who are more ambiguous, opening the possibility of identifying the Gate of the Prophet and al-Buraq with either the Double or Barclay&#x27;s Gate, is Burhan ad-Din ibn al-Firkah of Damascus (d. 1329). Another Mamluk-period writer, Mujir ad-Din (1496), is the first one to unambiguously identify Barclay&#x27;s Gate as the Gate of al-Buraq or of the Prophet. However, Mujir ad-Din&#x27;s work is effectively a rework of earlier texts, with as-Suyuti (1471) being the main source—and he fails to mention that as—Suyuti stated that the Gate of the Inspector, located close to the &quot;northern&quot; end of the western wall, was also known as the Gate of al-Buraq or of the Prophet.

====Ottoman-period identification====
To the previously mentioned variations in identification adds yet another gate, the now walled-up Funeral Gate (&quot;bab al-jana&#x27;iz&quot;), just south of the Golden Gate, also known as &#x27;Gate of al-Buraq&#x27; and marked as such on a 1864 Temple Mount map by Melchior de Vogüé, based on the 1833 survey by Frederick Catherwood (see Bab al-Rahmah Cemetery at MadainProject.com for a photo and short description).

When a British Jew asked the Egyptian authorities in 1840 for permission to re-pave the ground in front of the Western Wall, the governor of Syria wrote:
:It is evident from the copy of the record of the deliberations of the Consultative Council in Jerusalem that the place the Jews asked for permission to pave adjoins the wall of the Haram al-Sharif and also the spot where al-Buraq was tethered, and is included in the endowment charter of Abu Madyan, may God bless his memory; that the Jews never carried out any repairs in that place in the past. ... Therefore the Jews must not be enabled to pave the place.

Carl Sandreczki, who was charged with compiling a list of place names for Charles Wilson&#x27;s Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem in 1865, reported that the street leading to the Western Wall, including the part alongside the wall, belonged to the &quot;Hosh&quot; (court/enclosure) of &quot;al Burâk&quot;, &quot;not &quot;Obrâk&quot;, nor &quot;Obrat&quot;&quot;. In 1866, the Prussian Consul and Orientalist Georg Rosen wrote that &quot;The Arabs call Obrâk the entire length of the wall at the wailing place of the Jews, southwards down to the house of Abu Su&#x27;ud and northwards up to the substructure of the Mechkemeh [Shariah court]. Obrâk is not, as was formerly claimed, a corruption of the word Ibri (Hebrews), but simply the neo-Arabic pronunciation of Bōrâk, ... which, whilst (Muhammad) was at prayer at the holy rock, is said to have been tethered by him inside the wall location mentioned above.&quot;

The name Hosh al Buraq appeared on the maps of Wilson&#x27;s 1865 survey, its revised editions of 1876 and 1900, and other maps in the early 20th century.

====British Mandate====
In 1922, Hosh al Buraq was the street name specified by the official Pro-Jerusalem Council.

==In Christianity==
Some scholars believe that when Jerusalem came under Christian rule in the 4th century, there was a purposeful &quot;transference&quot; of respect for the Temple Mount and the Western Wall in terms of sanctity to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, while the sites around the Temple Mount became a refuse dump for Christians. However, the actions of many modern Christian leaders, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, who visited the Wall and left prayer messages in its crevices, have symbolized for many Christians a restoration of respect and even veneration for this ancient religious site.

==Ideological views==
===Jewish===
Most Jews, religious and secular, consider the wall to be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap.

Israeli philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz referred to the attitude towards the Western Wall as &quot;idolatry&quot; and publicly decried the Israelis&#x27; triumphalism following the 1967 victory.

Dan Bahat, former district archaeologist of Jerusalem who headed the Western Wall Tunnel excavations in the years 1986–2007, decried in 2018 the transformation of this iconic historical site into a regulated place of worship: &quot;The Western Wall is sacrosanct. But out of a national monument, it has become a synagogue.&quot;

===Israeli===
A poll carried out in 2007 by the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies indicated that 96% of Israeli Jews were against Israel relinquishing the Western Wall. 

Yitzhak Reiter writes that &quot;the Islamization and de-Judaization of the Western Wall are a recurrent motif in publications and public statements by the heads of the Islamic Movement in Israel.&quot;

===Muslim===
In December 1973, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia stated that &quot;Only Muslims and Christians have holy places and rights in Jerusalem&quot;. The Jews, he maintained, had no rights there at all. As for the Western Wall, he said, &quot;Another wall can be built for them. They can pray against that&quot;.

===Palestinian===
The Palestinian National Authority&#x27;s State Information Service (SIS) stated as fact that the Jews did not consider the Wall as a place for worship until after the Balfour Declaration was issued in 1917.

In 2006, Dr. Hassan Khader, founder of the Al Quds Encyclopedia, told PA television that the first connection of the Jews to the Wall is &quot;a recent one, which began in the 16th century...not ancient...like the roots of the Islamic connection&quot;.

The Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ekrima Sa&#x27;id Sabri said in 2007 that &quot;there never was a Jewish temple on the Temple Mount&quot; and that &quot;there is not a single stone with any relation at all to the history of the Hebrews.&quot;

In November 2010, an official paper published by the PA Ministry of Information denied Jewish rights to the Wall. It stated that &quot;Al-Buraq Wall is in fact the western wall of Al-Aksa Mosque&quot; and that Jews had only started using the site for worship after the 1917 Balfour Declaration.

===American===
While recognizing the difficulties inherent in any ultimate peace agreement that involves the status of Jerusalem, the official position of the United States includes a recognition of the importance of the Wall to the Jewish people, and has condemned statements that seek to &quot;delegitimize&quot; the relationship between Jews and the area in general, and the Western Wall in particular. For example, in November 2010, the Obama administration &quot;strongly condemned a Palestinian official&#x27;s claim that the Western Wall in the Old City has no religious significance for Jews and is actually Muslim property.&quot; The U.S. State Department noted that the United States rejects such a claim as &quot;factually incorrect, insensitive and highly provocative.&quot;

==Administration==
After the 1967 Arab–Israeli war, Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz was named the overseer of proceedings at the wall. After Rabbi Getz&#x27;s death in 1995, Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz was given the position. The Western Wall Heritage Foundation is the administrative body put in charge of the Wall.

<doc id="75229" wikidata="Q369944" url="?curid=75229" title="The Gulag Archipelago">
<text>The Gulag Archipelago: An Experiment in Literary Investigation () is a three-volume non-fiction series written between 1958 and 1968 by Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a Soviet dissident. It was first published in 1973 by the Parisian publisher YMCA-Press, and it was translated into English and French the following year. It explores a vision of life in what is often known as the Gulag, the Soviet labour camp system. Solzhenitsyn constructed his highly detailed narrative from various sources including reports, interviews, statements, diaries, legal documents, and his own experience as a Gulag prisoner. 

Following its publication, the book was initially circulated in the Soviet Union by &quot;samizdat&quot; underground publication. It was not widely published there until 1989. It appeared that year in the literary journal &quot;Novy Mir&quot;; a third of the work was published in three issues. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; has been officially published in Russia.

== Structure ==
As structured in most printed editions, the text comprises seven sections divided into three volumes: parts 1 and 2, parts 3 and 4, and parts 5 to 7. At one level, the &quot;Gulag Archipelago&quot; traces the history of the system of forced labor camps that operated in the Soviet Union from 1918 to 1956. Solzhenitsyn begins with Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s original decrees that were made shortly after the October Revolution; they established the legal and practical framework for a series of camps where political prisoners and ordinary criminals would be sentenced to forced labor.

The book describes and discusses the waves of purges and the assembling of show trials by Stalin through the 1930s in the context of the development of the greater Gulag system; Solzhenitsyn closely examines its purposive legal and bureaucratic development. The narrative ends in 1956 at the time of Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s Secret Speech (&quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot;). Khrushchev gave the speech at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, denouncing Joseph Stalin&#x27;s personality cult, his autocratic power, and the widespread surveillance of all classes of people that pervaded the Stalin era.

Parallel to this historical and legal narrative, Solzhenitsyn follows the typical course of a &quot;zek&quot; through the Gulag. This was a slang term for an inmate, derived from the widely used abbreviation &quot;z&quot;/&quot;k&quot; for &quot;zakliuchenny&quot; (&quot;prisoner&quot;). He started with arrest, show trial, and initial internment, continuing with the transport to the Gulag. In that setting, he explored the treatment of prisoners and their general living conditions, slave labor gangs and the technical prison camp system, camp rebellions and strikes, such as the Kengir uprising; the practice of continued internal exile following the completion of the original prison sentence, and the ultimate but not guaranteed release of the prisoner, if one survived. Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s examination details the trivial and commonplace events of an average prisoner&#x27;s life, as well as specific and noteworthy events during the history of the Gulag system, including revolts and uprisings.

== Thesis ==
At Chapter 4, Solzhenitsyn writes: &quot;Macbeth’s self-justifications were feeble – and his conscience devoured him. Yes, even Iago was a little lamb, too. The imagination and spiritual strength of Shakespeare&#x27;s evildoers stopped short at a dozen corpses. Because they had no &quot;ideology&quot;. Ideology – that is what gives evildoing its long-sought justification and gives the evildoer the necessary steadfastness and determination. That is the social theory which helps to make his acts seem good instead of bad in his own and others&#x27; eyes... That was how the agents of the Inquisition fortified their wills: by invoking Christianity; the conquerors of foreign lands, by extolling the grandeur of their Motherland; the colonizers, by civilization; the Nazis, by race; and the Jacobins (early and late), by equality, brotherhood, and the happiness of future generations... Without evildoers there would have been no Archipelago.&quot;

Solzhenitsyn painstakingly laid the theoretical, legal, and practical origins of the Gulag system at Lenin&#x27;s feet, not Stalin&#x27;s. According to Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s testimony, Stalin amplified a concentration camp system that was already in place and this was significant because he said many Western intellectuals considered the Soviet prison camp system to be a Stalinist aberration.

Solzhenitsyn claims that although many practices had been stopped, the basic structure of the system had survived and it could be revived and expanded by future leaders. While Khrushchev, the Communist Party, and the Soviet Union&#x27;s supporters in the West viewed the Gulag as a deviation of Stalin, Solzhenitsyn and others among the opposition tended to view it as a systemic fault of Soviet political culture, and an inevitable outcome of the Bolshevik political project.

== Publication ==
After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s materials in Moscow, during 1965–1967, he worked to develop his preparatory drafts of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; into finished typescript. He accomplished some of this while in hiding at his friends&#x27; homes in the Moscow region and elsewhere.

While held at the KGB&#x27;s Lubyanka Prison in 1945, Solzhenitsyn had befriended Arnold Susi, a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education, who had been taken captive after the Soviet Union occupied Estonia in 1944. Solzhenitsyn entrusted Susi with the original typed and proofread manuscript of the finished work, after copies had been made of it both on paper and on microfilm. Susi got the manuscript to his daughter, Heli Susi, who kept the &quot;master copy&quot; hidden from the KGB in Estonia until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

In 1973, the KGB seized one of only three existing copies of the text still on Soviet soil. This was achieved by interrogating Elizaveta Voronyanskaya, one of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s trusted typists who knew where the typed copy was hidden. Within days of her release by the KGB she was found hanged in the stairwell of her apartment on the 3rd of August 1973. She had apparently either hanged herself or been murdered. Solzhenitsyn had wanted the manuscript to be first published in Russia, but knew this was impossible under conditions then extant. After Solzhenitsyn learned of Voronyanskaya&#x27;s death he decided to allow its publication in Paris. The first edition of the work was published in Russian by the Parisian publishing house YMCA-Press (founded by Russian immigrants) a few days after Christmas 1973. They had received a go-ahead from Solzhenitsyn but had decided to release the work about ten days earlier than he had expected. News of the nature of the work immediately caused a stir, and translations into many other languages followed within the next few months, sometimes produced in a race against time. American Thomas P. Whitney produced the English version. The English and French translations of Volume I appeared in the spring and summer of 1974.

The work had a profound effect internationally. Not only did it provoke energetic debate in the West; a mere six weeks after the work had left Parisian presses Solzhenitsyn himself was forced into exile. Because possession of the manuscript incurred the risk of a long prison sentence for &quot;anti-Soviet activities&quot;, Solzhenitsyn never worked on the manuscript in complete form. Since he was under constant KGB surveillance, Solzhenitsyn worked on only parts of the manuscript at any one time, so as not to put the full book into jeopardy if he happened to be arrested.

For this reason, he secreted the various parts of the work throughout Moscow and the surrounding suburbs, in the care of trusted friends. Sometimes when he was purportedly visiting them on social calls he actually worked on the manuscript in their homes. During much of this time, Solzhenitsyn lived at the dacha of the world-famous cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, and due to the reputation and standing of the musician, despite the elevated scrutiny of the Soviet authorities, Solzhenitsyn was reasonably safe from KGB searches there.

With the possible exception of &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;, it is his best-known and most popular work, at least in the West. Finished in 1968, &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; was microfilmed and smuggled out to Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s main legal representative, Fritz Heeb of Zürich, to await publication; a later paper copy, also smuggled out, was signed by Heinrich Böll at the foot of each page to prove against possible accusations of a falsified work. Solzhenitsyn was aware that there was a wealth of material and perspectives about Gulag to be continued in the future, but he considered the book finished for his part. The royalties and sales income for the book were transferred to the Solzhenitsyn Aid Fund for aid to former camp prisoners. His fund, (The Russian Social Fund), which had to work in secret in its native country, managed to transfer substantial amounts of money towards helping former gulag prisoners in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Reception and impact ==
Beginning in 2009, Russian schools issued the book as required reading. Russian president Vladimir Putin called the book &quot;much-needed&quot;, while the Russian Ministry of Education said that the book showed &quot;vital historical and cultural heritage on the course of 20th-century domestic history.&quot; Arseny Roginsky, then head of the human-rights organization Memorial, welcomed Putin&#x27;s backing for the Solzhenitsyn textbook.

Natalya Reshetovskaya described her ex-husband&#x27;s book as &quot;folklore&quot;, telling a newspaper in 1974 that she felt the book was &quot;not in fact the life of the country and not even the life of the camps but the folklore of the camps.&quot; In her 1974 memoir, Reshetovskaya wrote that Solzhenitsyn did not consider the novel to be &quot;historical research, or scientific research&quot;, and stated that the significance of the novel had been &quot;overestimated and wrongly appraised.&quot; Reshetovskaya created an abridged version for Russian high-school students, including an introduction about the nature of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s &quot;experiment in literary investigation.&quot; Her books were published by the Novosti Press, a state-run media founded by the USSR Council of People&#x27;s Commissars and the Communist Party Central Committee. Her editor there was Konstantin Semyonov, and he became her third husband.

=== Academic ===
Historian and archival researcher Stephen G. Wheatcroft described the book as &quot;a fine literary masterpiece, a sharp political indictment against the Soviet regime, and has had tremendous importance in raising the issue of Soviet repression in the Russian consciousness.&quot; Wheatcroft wrote that the book was essentially a &quot;literary and political work&quot;, and &quot;never claimed to place the camps in a historical or social-scientific quantitative perspective&quot; but that in the case of qualitative estimates, Solzhenitsyn gave his inaccurately high estimate as he wanted to challenge the Soviet authorities to show that &quot;the scale of the camps was less than this.&quot; Wheatcroft stated that historians relied on Solzhenitsyn to support their estimates of deaths under Stalin in the tens of millions but research in the state archives vindicated the lower estimates, while adding that the popular press has continued to include serious errors that should not be cited, or relied on, in academia.&quot;

UCLA historian J. Arch Getty wrote of Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s methodology that &quot;such documentation is methodologically unacceptable in other fields of history&quot; and that &quot;the work is of limited value to the serious student of the 1930s for it provides no important new information or original analytical framework. Gabor Rittersporn shared Getty&#x27;s criticism, saying that &quot;he is inclined to give priority to vague reminiscences and hearsay ... [and] inevitably [leads] towards selective bias&quot;, adding that &quot;one might dwell at length on the inaccuracies discernible in Solzhenitsyn’s work&quot;. Vadim Rogovin writes of the eyewitness accounts that Solzhenitsyn had read, saying he &quot;took plenty of license in outlining their contents and interpreting them&quot;. Both Rogovin and Walter Laquer argue that the book belongs to the genre of &#x27;oral history&#x27;.

In an interview with the German weekly newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, British historian Orlando Figes stated that many Gulag inmates he interviewed for his research identified so strongly with the book&#x27;s contents that they became unable to distinguish between their own experiences and what they read: &quot;&quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; spoke for a whole nation and was the voice of all those who suffered.&quot; Soviet dissident and historian Roy Medvedev referred to the book as &quot;extremely contradictory&quot;. In a review for the book, Medvedev described it as without parallel for its impact, saying: &quot;I believe there are few who will get up from their desks after reading this book the same as when they opened its first page. In this regard I have nothing with which to compare Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s book either in Russian or world literature.&quot; In the same review, he also writes that &quot;This book is full of thoughts and observations, some profound and true, others perhaps not always true but born in the monstrous sufferings of tens of millions of persons.&quot;

=== Popular press ===
Novelist Doris Lessing said that the book &quot;brought down an empire&quot;, while author Michael Scammell described the book as a gesture that &quot;amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state, calling its very legitimacy into question and demanding revolutionary change.&quot; About its impact, philosopher Isaiah Berlin wrote: &quot;Until the Gulag, the Communists and their allies had persuaded their followers that denunciations of the regime were largely bourgeois propaganda.&quot; United States diplomat George F. Kennan said that the book was &quot;the most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be levied in modern times.&quot;

Author Tom Butler-Bowdon has described the book as a &quot;Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s monument to the millions tortured and murdered in Soviet Russia between the Bolshevik Revolution and the 1950s.&quot; An edition of &quot;The Book Show&quot; said that the book helped expose the brutality of the Soviet system. Psychologist Jordan Peterson, who wrote the foreword of an abridged fiftieth anniversary edition released on 1 November 2018, described &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; as the most important book of the twentieth century.

Parallels have been drawn between the book and the treatment of Liao Yiwu, a dissident who is dubbed &quot;the Chinese Solzhenitsyn&quot; according to the Agence France-Presse. Author David Aikman stated that Liao is the first Chinese dissident writer to &quot;come up with a very detailed account of prison conditions including torture in China in the same way that [Soviet dissident Aleksandr] Solzhenitsyn did in &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;.&quot;

== Television documentary ==
In December 2009, the Russian channel &quot;Rossiya K&quot; showed the French television documentary &quot;L&#x27;Histoire Secrète de l&#x27;Archipel du Goulag&quot; made by Jean Crépu and Nicolas Miletitch, and translated it into Russian under the title &quot;Taynaya Istoriya &quot;Arkhipelaga GULAG&quot;&quot; (&quot;Secret History: The Gulag Archipelago&quot;). The documentary covers events related to the writing and publication of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;.

== Explanatory notes ==
:1. In Russian, the term &quot;GULAG&quot; () is an acronym for Main Directorate of Camps ().
:2. A similar (but on vastly smaller scale) network of forced labour camps, known as &quot;katorga&quot;, existed in the Russian Empire since the early 18th century. It was abolished by the Russian Provisional Government in 1917.

<doc id="75233" wikidata="Q221697" url="?curid=75233" title="Hilary Putnam">
<text>Hilary Whitehall Putnam (; July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, and figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem.

Putnam applied equal scrutiny to his own philosophical positions as to those of others, subjecting each position to rigorous analysis until he exposed its flaws. As a result, he acquired a reputation for frequently changing his positions. In philosophy of mind, Putnam argued against the type-identity of mental and physical states based on his hypothesis of the multiple realizability of the mental, and for the concept of functionalism, an influential theory regarding the mind–body problem. Putnam also originated the computational theory of mind. In philosophy of language, along with Saul Kripke and others, he developed the causal theory of reference, and formulated an original theory of meaning, introducing the notion of semantic externalism based on a thought experiment called Twin Earth.

In philosophy of mathematics, Putnam and W. V. O. Quine developed the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument, an argument for the reality of mathematical entities, later espousing the view that mathematics is not purely logical, but &quot;quasi-empirical&quot;. In epistemology, Putnam criticized the &quot;brain in a vat&quot; thought experiment, which appears to provide a powerful argument for epistemological skepticism, by challenging its coherence. In metaphysics, he originally espoused a position called metaphysical realism, but eventually became one of its most outspoken critics, first adopting a view he called &quot;internal realism&quot;, which he later abandoned. Despite these changes of view, throughout his career Putnam remained committed to scientific realism, roughly the view that mature scientific theories are approximately true descriptions of ways things are.

In his later work, Putnam became increasingly interested in American pragmatism, Jewish philosophy, and ethics, engaging with a wider array of philosophical traditions. He also displayed an interest in metaphilosophy, seeking to &quot;renew philosophy&quot; from what he identified as narrow and inflated concerns. He was at times a politically controversial figure, especially for his involvement with the Progressive Labor Party in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auxier&quot;&lt;/

== Life ==
Hilary Whitehall Putnam was born on July 31, 1926, in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Samuel Putnam, was a scholar of Romance languages, columnist, and translator who wrote for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, a publication of the American Communist Party, from 1936 to 1946. Because of his father&#x27;s commitment to communism, Putnam had a secular upbringing, although his mother, Riva, was Jewish. In early 1927, six months after Hilary&#x27;s birth, the family moved to France, where Samuel was under contract to translate the surviving works of François Rabelais. In a 2015 autobiographical essay, Putnam said that his first childhood memories were from his life in France, and his first language was French.

Putnam completed the first two years of his primary education in France before he and his parents returned to the U.S. in 1933, settling in Philadelphia. There, he attended Central High School, where he met Noam Chomsky, who was a year behind him. The two remained friends—and often intellectual opponents—for the rest of Putnam&#x27;s life. Putnam studied philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his B.A. degree and becoming a member of the Philomathean Society, the country&#x27;s oldest continually existing collegiate literary society. He did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University and later at UCLA&#x27;s philosophy department, where he received his Ph.D. in 1951 for his dissertation, &quot;The Meaning of the Concept of Probability in Application to Finite Sequences&quot;. Putnam&#x27;s dissertation supervisor Hans Reichenbach was a leading figure in logical positivism, the dominant school of philosophy of the day; one of Putnam&#x27;s most consistent positions was his rejection of logical positivism as self-defeating. Over the course of his life, Putnam was his own philosophical adversary, changing his positions on philosophical questions and critiquing his previous views.

After obtaining his PhD, Putnam taught at Northwestern University (1951–52), Princeton University (1953–61), and MIT (1961–65). For the rest of his career, Putnam taught at Harvard&#x27;s philosophy department, becoming Cogan University Professor. In 1962, he married fellow philosopher Ruth Anna Putnam (born Ruth Anna Jacobs), who took a teaching position in philosophy at Wellesley College. Rebelling against the antisemitism they experienced during their youth, the Putnams decided to establish a traditional Jewish home for their children. Since they had no experience with the rituals of Judaism, they sought out invitations to other Jewish homes for Seder. They began to study Jewish rituals and Hebrew, became more interested in Judaism, self-identified as Jews, and actively practiced Judaism. In 1994, Hilary celebrated a belated bar mitzvah service; Ruth Anna&#x27;s bat mitzvah was celebrated four years later.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Putnam was an active supporter of the American Civil Rights Movement and he was also an active opponent of the Vietnam War. In 1963, he organized one of MIT&#x27;s first faculty and student anti-war committees. After moving to Harvard in 1965, he organized campus protests and began teaching courses on Marxism. Putnam became an official faculty advisor to the Students for a Democratic Society and in 1968 a member of the Progressive Labor Party (PLP). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. After 1968, his political activities centered on the PLP. The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam. Putnam permanently severed his relationship with the PLP in 1972. In 1997, at a meeting of former draft resistance activists at Boston&#x27;s Arlington Street Church, he called his involvement with the PLP a mistake. He said he had been impressed at first with the PLP&#x27;s commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces.

In 1976, Putnam was elected president of the American Philosophical Association. The next year, he was selected as Walter Beverly Pearson Professor of Mathematical Logic in recognition of his contributions to the philosophy of logic and mathematics. While breaking with his radical past, Putnam never abandoned his belief that academics have a particular social and ethical responsibility toward society. He continued to be forthright and progressive in his political views, as expressed in the articles &quot;How Not to Solve Ethical Problems&quot; (1983) and &quot;Education for Democracy&quot; (1993).

Putnam was a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1999. He retired from teaching in June 2000, becoming Cogan University Professor Emeritus, but as of 2009 continued to give a seminar almost yearly at Tel Aviv University. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the University of Amsterdam in 2001. His corpus includes five volumes of collected works, seven books, and more than 200 articles. Putnam&#x27;s renewed interest in Judaism inspired him to publish several books and essays on the topic. With his wife, he co-authored several essays and a book on the late-19th-century American pragmatist movement.

For his contributions in philosophy and logic, Putnam was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize in 2011 and the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy in 2015. Putnam died at his home in Arlington, Massachusetts, on March 13, 2016. At the time of his death, Putnam was Cogan University Professor Emeritus at Harvard University.

== Philosophy of mind ==
=== Multiple realizability ===
Putnam&#x27;s best-known work concerns philosophy of mind. His most noted original contributions to that field came in several key papers published in the late 1960s that set out the hypothesis of multiple realizability. In these papers, Putnam argues that, contrary to the famous claim of the type-identity theory, pain may correspond to utterly different physical states of the nervous system in different organisms even if they all experience the same mental state of &quot;being in pain&quot;. Putnam cited examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his thesis. He asked whether it was likely that the brain structures of diverse types of animals realize pain, or other mental states, the same way. If they do not share the same brain structures, they cannot share the same mental states and properties, in which case mental states must be realized by different physical states in different species. Putnam then took his argument a step further, asking about such things as the nervous systems of alien beings, artificially intelligent robots and other silicon-based life forms. These hypothetical entities, he contended, should not be considered incapable of experiencing pain just because they lack human neurochemistry. Putnam concluded that type-identity theorists had been making an &quot;ambitious&quot; and &quot;highly implausible&quot; conjecture that could be disproved by one example of multiple realizability. This is sometimes called the &quot;likelihood argument&quot;, as it focuses on the claim that multiple realizability is more likely than type-identity theory.

Putnam also formulated an &quot;a priori&quot; argument in favor of multiple realizability based on what he called &quot;functional isomorphism&quot;. He defined the concept in these terms: &quot;Two systems are functionally isomorphic if &#x27;there is a correspondence between the states of one and the states of the other that preserves functional relations&#x27;.&quot; In the case of computers, two machines are functionally isomorphic if and only if the sequential relations among states in the first exactly mirror the sequential relations among states in the other. Therefore, a computer made of silicon chips and one made of cogs and wheels can be functionally isomorphic but constitutionally diverse. Functional isomorphism implies multiple realizability.

Putnam, Jerry Fodor, and others argued that along with being an effective argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general. Functionalism, which identifies mental kinds with functional kinds that are characterized exclusively in terms of causes and effects, abstracts from the level of microphysics, and therefore seemed to be a better explanation of the relation between mind and body. In fact, there are many functional kinds, including mousetraps and eyes, that are multiply realized at the physical level.

Multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, to be able to conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland have also criticized metaphysical realism.

=== Machine state functionalism ===
Putnam himself put forth the first formulation of such a functionalist theory. This formulation, now called &quot;machine-state functionalism&quot;, was inspired by analogies Putnam and others made between the mind and Turing machines. The point for functionalism is the nature of the states of the Turing machine. Each state can be defined in terms of its relations to the other states and to the inputs and outputs, and the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant. According to machine-state functionalism, the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of a Turing machine state. Just as &quot;state one&quot; simply is the state in which, given a particular input, such-and-such happens, so being in pain is the state which disposes one to cry &quot;ouch&quot;, become distracted, wonder what the cause is, and so forth.

=== Rejection of functionalism ===
Ian Hacking called &quot;Representation and Reality&quot; (1988) a book that &quot;will mostly be read as Putnam&#x27;s denunciation of his former philosophical psychology, to which he gave the name &#x27;functionalism&#x27;.&quot; Writing in &quot;Noûs&quot;, Barbara Hannon described &quot;the inventor of functionalism&quot; as arguing &quot;against his own former computationalist views&quot;.

Putnam&#x27;s change of mind was primarily due to the difficulties computational theories have in explaining certain intuitions with respect to the externalism of mental content. This is illustrated by his Twin Earth thought experiment.

In 1988 Putnam also developed a separate argument against functionalism based on Fodor&#x27;s generalized version of multiple realizability. Asserting that functionalism is really a watered-down identity theory in which mental kinds are identified with functional kinds, he argued that mental kinds may be multiply realizable over functional kinds. The argument for functionalism is that the same mental state could be implemented by the different states of a universal Turing machine.

Despite Putnam&#x27;s rejection of functionalism, it has continued to flourish and been developed into numerous versions by Fodor, David Marr, Daniel Dennett, and David Lewis, among others. Functionalism helped lay the foundations for modern cognitive science and was the dominant theory of mind in philosophy in the last part of the 20th century.

By 2012 Putnam accepted a modification of functionalism called &quot;liberal functionalism&quot;. The view holds that &quot;what matters for consciousness and for mental properties generally is the right sort of functional capacities and not the particular matter that subserves those capacities&quot;. The specification of these capacities may refer to what goes on outside the organism&#x27;s &quot;brain&quot;, may include intentional idioms, and need not describe a capacity to compute something or other.

Putnam himself formulated one of the main arguments against functionalism, the Twin Earth thought experiment, though there have been additional criticisms. John Searle&#x27;s Chinese room argument (1980) is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions. It is designed to show that it is possible to mimic intelligent action with a purely functional system, without any interpretation or understanding. Searle describes a situation in which a person who speaks only English is locked in a room with Chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in English for moving the symbols around. People outside the room instruct the person inside to follow the rule book for sending certain symbols out of the room when given certain symbols. The people outside the room speak Chinese and are communicating with the person inside via the Chinese symbols. According to Searle, it would be absurd to claim that the English speaker inside &quot;knows&quot; Chinese based on these syntactic processes alone. This argument attempts to show that systems that operate merely on syntactic processes cannot realize any semantics (meaning) or intentionality (aboutness). Searle thus attacks the idea that thought can be equated with following a set of syntactic rules and concludes that functionalism is an inadequate theory of the mind. Ned Block has advanced several other arguments against functionalism.

== Philosophy of language ==
=== Semantic externalism ===
One of Putnam&#x27;s contributions to philosophy of language is his semantic externalism, the claim that terms&#x27; meanings are determined by factors outside the mind, encapsulated in his slogan that &quot;meaning just ain&#x27;t in the head&quot;. His views on meaning, first laid out in &quot;Meaning and Reference&quot; (1973), then in&quot; The Meaning of &quot;Meaning&quot;&quot; (1975), use his &quot;Twin Earth&quot; thought experiment to defend this thesis.

Twin Earth shows this, according to Putnam, since on Twin Earth everything is identical to Earth, except that its lakes, rivers and oceans are filled with XYZ rather than H2O. Consequently, when an earthling, Fredrick, uses the Earth-English word &quot;water&quot;, it has a different meaning from the Twin Earth-English word &quot;water&quot; when used by his physically identical twin, Frodrick, on Twin Earth. Since Fredrick and Frodrick are physically indistinguishable when they utter their respective words, and since their words have different meanings, meaning cannot be determined solely by what is in their heads. This led Putnam to adopt a version of semantic externalism with regard to meaning and mental content. The philosopher of mind and language Donald Davidson, despite his many differences of opinion with Putnam, wrote that semantic externalism constituted an &quot;anti-subjectivist revolution&quot; in philosophers&#x27; way of seeing the world. Since Descartes&#x27;s time, philosophers had been concerned with proving knowledge from the basis of subjective experience. Thanks to Putnam, Saul Kripke, Tyler Burge and others, Davidson said, philosophy could now take the objective realm for granted and start questioning the alleged &quot;truths&quot; of subjective experience.

=== Theory of meaning ===
Along with Kripke, Keith Donnellan, and others, Putnam contributed to what is known as the causal theory of reference. In particular, he maintained in &quot;The Meaning of &quot;Meaning&quot;&quot; that the objects referred to by natural kind terms—such as &quot;tiger&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, and &quot;tree&quot;—are the principal elements of the meaning of such terms. There is a linguistic division of labor, analogous to Adam Smith&#x27;s economic division of labor, according to which such terms have their references fixed by the &quot;experts&quot; in the particular field of science to which the terms belong. So, for example, the reference of the term &quot;lion&quot; is fixed by the community of zoologists, the reference of the term &quot;elm tree&quot; is fixed by the community of botanists, and chemists fix the reference of the term &quot;table salt&quot; as sodium chloride. These referents are considered rigid designators in the Kripkean sense and are disseminated outward to the linguistic community.

Putnam specifies a finite sequence of elements (a vector) for the description of the meaning of every term in the language. Such a vector consists of four components:
# the object to which the term refers, e.g., the object individuated by the chemical formula H2O;
# a set of typical descriptions of the term, referred to as &quot;the stereotype&quot;, e.g., &quot;transparent&quot;, &quot;colorless&quot;, and &quot;hydrating&quot;;
# the semantic indicators that place the object into a general category, e.g., &quot;natural kind&quot; and &quot;liquid&quot;;
# the syntactic indicators, e.g., &quot;concrete noun&quot; and &quot;mass noun&quot;.

Such a &quot;meaning-vector&quot; provides a description of the reference and use of an expression within a particular linguistic community. It provides the conditions for its correct usage and makes it possible to judge whether a single speaker attributes the appropriate meaning to it or whether its use has changed enough to cause a difference in its meaning. According to Putnam, it is legitimate to speak of a change in the meaning of an expression only if the reference of the term, and not its stereotype, has changed. But since no possible algorithm can determine which aspect—the stereotype or the reference—has changed in a particular case, it is necessary to consider the usage of other expressions of the language. Since there is no limit to the number of such expressions to be considered, Putnam embraced a form of semantic holism.

Despite the many changes in his other positions, Putnam consistently adhered to semantic holism. Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others have identified problems with this position. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression in the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we will never be able to master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same expression, and therefore how any communication is possible between them. Given a sentence &quot;P&quot;, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and &quot;P&quot; is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, &quot;P&quot; means one thing to Fred and something else to Mary. Moreover, if &quot;P&quot; derives its meaning from its relations with all the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of &quot;P&quot;. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that &quot;P&quot; has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if one accepts the truth of a sentence and then rejects it later on, the meaning of what one rejected and what one accepted are completely different and therefore one cannot change opinions with regard to the same sentences.

== Philosophy of mathematics ==
In the philosophy of mathematics, Putnam has utilized indispensability arguments to argue for a realist interpretation of mathematics. In his 1971 book &quot;Philosophy of Logic&quot;, he presented what has since been called the of the Quine–Putnam indispensability argument. The argument, which he attributed to Willard Van Orman Quine, is presented in the book as &quot;quantification over mathematical entities is indispensable for science, both formal and physical; therefore we should accept such quantification; but this commits us to accepting the existence of the mathematical entities in question.&quot; According to Charles Parsons, Putnam &quot;very likely&quot; endorsed this version of the argument in his early work, but later came to deny some of the views present in it.

In 1975, Putnam formulated his own indispensability argument based on the no miracles argument in the philosophy of science, saying, &quot;I believe that the positive argument for realism [in science] has an analogue in the case of mathematical realism. Here too, I believe, realism is the only philosophy that doesn&#x27;t make the success of the science a miracle&quot;. According to Putnam, Quine&#x27;s version of the argument was an argument for the existence of abstract mathematical objects, while Putnam&#x27;s own argument was simply for a realist interpretation of mathematics, which he believed could be provided by a &quot;mathematics as modal logic&quot; interpretation that need not imply the existence of abstract objects.

Putnam also held the view that mathematics, like physics and other empirical sciences, uses both strict logical proofs and &quot;quasi-empirical&quot; methods. For example, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem states that for no integer formula_1 are there positive integer values of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; such that formula_2. Before Andrew Wiles proved this for all formula_1 in 1995, it had been proved for many values of &quot;n&quot;. These proofs inspired further research in the area, and formed a quasi-empirical consensus for the theorem. Even though such knowledge is more conjectural than a strictly proved theorem, it was still used in developing other mathematical ideas.

The Quine–Putnam indispensability argument has been extremely influential in the philosophy of mathematics, inspiring continued debate and development of the argument in contemporary philosophy of mathematics. According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, many in the field consider it the best argument for mathematical realism. Prominent counterarguments come from Hartry Field, who argues that mathematics is not indispensable to science, and Penelope Maddy and Elliott Sober, who dispute whether we are committed to mathematical realism even if it is indispensable to science.

== Mathematics and computer science ==
Putnam has contributed to scientific fields not directly related to his work in philosophy. As a mathematician, he contributed to the resolution of Hilbert&#x27;s tenth problem in mathematics. This problem (now known as Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem or the MRDP theorem) was settled by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970, with a proof that relied heavily on previous research by Putnam, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis.

In computability theory, Putnam investigated the structure of the ramified analytical hierarchy, its connection with the constructible hierarchy and its Turing degrees. He showed that there are many levels of the constructible hierarchy that add no subsets of the integers. Later, with his student George Boolos, he showed that the first such &quot;non-index&quot; is the ordinal formula_4 of ramified analysis (this is the smallest formula_5 such that formula_6 is a model of full second-order comprehension). Also, together with a separate paper with his student Richard Boyd and Gustav Hensel, he demonstrated how the Davis–Mostowski–Kleene hyperarithmetical hierarchy of arithmetical degrees can be naturally extended up to formula_4.

In computer science, Putnam is known for the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT), developed with Martin Davis in 1960. The algorithm finds whether there is a set of true or false values that satisfies a given Boolean expression so that the entire expression becomes true. In 1962, they further refined the algorithm with the help of George Logemann and Donald W. Loveland. It became known as the DPLL algorithm. It is efficient and still forms the basis of most complete SAT solvers.

== Epistemology ==
In epistemology, Putnam is known for his argument against skeptical scenarios based on the &quot;brain in a vat&quot; thought experiment (a modernized version of Descartes&#x27;s evil demon hypothesis). The argument is that one cannot coherently suspect that one is a disembodied &quot;brain in a vat&quot; placed there by some &quot;mad scientist&quot;.

This follows from the causal theory of reference. Words always refer to the kinds of things they were coined to refer to, the kinds of things their user, or the user&#x27;s ancestors, experienced. So, if some person, Mary, is a &quot;brain in a vat&quot;, whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the mad scientist, then Mary&#x27;s idea of a brain does not refer to a real brain, since she and her linguistic community have never encountered such a thing. To her a brain is actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Nor does her idea of a vat refer to a real vat. So if, as a brain in a vat, she says, &quot;I&#x27;m a brain in a vat&quot;, she is actually saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a brain-image in a vat-image&quot;, which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.

Putnam has clarified that his real target in this argument was never skepticism, but metaphysical realism, which he thought implied such skeptical scenarios were possible. Since realism of this kind assumes the existence of a gap between how one conceives the world and the way the world really is, skeptical scenarios such as this one (or Descartes&#x27;s evil demon) present a formidable challenge. By arguing that such a scenario is impossible, Putnam attempts to show that this notion of a gap between one&#x27;s concept of the world and the way it is is absurd. One cannot have a &quot;God&#x27;s-eye&quot; view of reality. One is limited to one&#x27;s conceptual schemes, and metaphysical realism is therefore false.

Putnam&#x27;s brain in a vat argument has been criticized. Crispin Wright argues that Putnam&#x27;s formulation of the brain-in-a-vat scenario is too narrow to refute global skepticism. The possibility that one is a recently disembodied brain in a vat is not undermined by semantic externalism. If a person has lived their entire life outside the vat—speaking the English language and interacting normally with the outside world—before &quot;envatment&quot; by a mad scientist, when they wake up inside the vat, their words and thoughts (e.g., &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;grass&quot;) will still refer to the objects or events in the external world they had referred to before envatment.

== Metaphilosophy and ontology ==
In the late 1970s and the 1980s, stimulated by results from mathematical logic and by some of Quine&#x27;s ideas, Putnam abandoned his long-standing defense of metaphysical realism—the view that the categories and structures of the external world are both causally and ontologically independent of the conceptualizations of the human mind—and adopted a rather different view, which he called &quot;internal realism&quot; or &quot;pragmatic realism&quot;. Internal realism is the view that, although the world may be &quot;causally&quot; independent of the human mind, the world&#x27;s structure—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not &quot;ontologically&quot; independent. The general idea is influenced by Immanuel Kant&#x27;s idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.

According to Putnam, the problem with metaphysical realism is that it fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the categories, kinds and individuals inherent in the external world. But how is it possible that the world &quot;carves up&quot; into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two carvings perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the world does not come pre-structured but that the human mind and its conceptual schemes impose structure on it. In &quot;Reason, Truth, and History&quot;, Putnam identified truth with what he termed &quot;idealized rational acceptability.&quot; The theory is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.

Nelson Goodman formulated a similar notion in &quot;Fact, Fiction and Forecast&quot; (1956). &quot;We have come to think of the actual as one among many possible worlds. We need to repaint that picture. All possible worlds lie within the actual one&quot;, Goodman wrote. Putnam rejected this form of social constructivism, but retained the idea that there can be many correct descriptions of reality. None of these descriptions can be scientifically proven to be the &quot;one, true&quot; description of the world. He thus accepted &quot;conceptual relativity&quot;—the view that it may be a matter of choice or convention, e.g., whether al sums exist, or whether spacetime points are individuals or mere limits.

Curtis Brown has criticized Putnam&#x27;s internal realism as a disguised form of subjective idealism, in which case it is subject to the traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one&#x27;s consciousness ceased to exist, then the rest of the universe would also cease to exist. In his reply to Simon Blackburn in the volume &quot;Reading Putnam&quot;, Putnam renounced internal realism because it assumed a &quot;cognitive interface&quot; model of the relation between the mind and the world. Under the increasing influence of William James and the pragmatists, he adopted a direct realist view of this relation. Although he abandoned internal realism, Putnam still resisted the idea that any given thing or system of things can be described in exactly one complete and correct way. He came to accept metaphysical realism in a broader sense, rejecting all forms of verificationism and all talk of our &quot;making&quot; the world.

In the philosophy of perception, Putnam came to endorse direct realism, according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. He once further held that there are no mental representations, sense data, or other intermediaries between the mind and the world. By 2012, however, he rejected this commitment in favor of &quot;transactionalism&quot;, a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve qualia.

== Quantum mechanics ==
During his career, Putnam espoused various positions on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. In the 1960s and 1970s, he contributed to the quantum logic tradition, holding that the way to resolve quantum theory&#x27;s apparent paradoxes is to modify the logical rules by which propositions&#x27; truth values are deduced. Putnam&#x27;s first foray into this topic was &quot;A Philosopher Looks at Quantum Mechanics&quot; in 1965, followed by his 1969 essay &quot;Is Logic Empirical?&quot;. He advanced different versions of quantum logic over the years, and eventually turned away from it in the 1990s, due to critiques by Nancy Cartwright, Michael Redhead, and others. In 2005, he wrote that he rejected the many-worlds interpretation because he could see no way for it to yield meaningful probabilities. He found both de Broglie–Bohm theory and the spontaneous collapse theory of Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber to be promising, yet also dissatisfying, since it was not clear that either could be made fully consistent with special relativity&#x27;s symmetry requirements.

== Neopragmatism and Wittgenstein ==
In the mid-1970s, Putnam became increasingly disillusioned with what he perceived as modern analytic philosophy&#x27;s &quot;scientism&quot; and focus on metaphysics over ethics and everyday concerns. He also became convinced by his readings of James and John Dewey that there is no fact–value dichotomy; that is, normative (e.g., ethical and aesthetic) judgments often have a factual basis, while scientific judgments have a normative element. For a time, under Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s influence, Putnam adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as no more than conceptual or linguistic confusions philosophers created by using ordinary language out of context. A book of articles on pragmatism by Ruth Anna Putnam and Hilary Putnam, &quot;Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey&quot;, edited by David Macarthur, was published in 2017.

Many of Putnam&#x27;s last works addressed the concerns of ordinary people, particularly social problems. For example, he wrote about the nature of democracy, social justice and religion. He also discussed Jürgen Habermas&#x27;s ideas, and wrote articles influenced by continental philosophy.
