<text>The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan (, &quot;Qazaqstan Respublikasynyñ Ükımetı&quot;) oversees a presidential republic. The President of Kazakhstan, currently Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, is head of state and nominates the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament.

According to the 2016 World Development report prepared by the World Bank Group, Kazakhstan ranks 28th among 193 countries in the e-Gov development rating. The &quot;Information Kazakhstan – 2020&quot; state program approved in 2013 helped the country transition to the information society.

The current cabinet is headed by Oljas Bektenov, who was sworn in as Prime Minister on 6 February 2024.

==Executive branch==

|President
|Kassym-Jomart Tokayev
|Amanat
|20 March 2019
|Prime Minister
|Oljas Bektenov
|Amanat
|6 February 2024 

===President===

The president is elected by popular vote for a single seven-year term. The prime minister and first deputy prime minister are appointed by the president. The Council of Ministers is also appointed by the president. Then-president Nursultan Nazarbayev expanded his presidential powers by decree: only he can initiate constitutional amendments, appoint and dismiss the government, dissolve Parliament, call referendums at his discretion, and appoint administrative heads of regions and cities.

The president is the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces and may veto legislation that has been passed by the Parliament.

=== Prime minister ===

The prime minister, who serves at the pleasure of the president, chairs the Council of Ministers and serves as Kazakhstan&#x27;s head of government. There are three deputy prime ministers and 17 ministers in the council. The most recent Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan is Oljas Bektenov.

===Agencies and committees===
Kazakhstan&#x27;s National Security Committee (NSC) was established on 13 June 1992. It includes the Service of Internal Security, Military Counterintelligence, Border Guard, several Commandos units, and Foreign Intelligence (Barlau). The latter is considered by many as the most important part of NSC. Penitentiary Service Committee is a part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

==Legislative branch==
The legislature, known as the Parliament (&quot;Parlamenti&quot;), has two chambers.

=== Assembly ===
The Assembly (&quot;Mäjilis&quot;) has 98 seats, elected for a five-year term, 69 by proportional representation and 29 in single-member constituencies. Mäjilis deputies and the government both have the right of legislative initiative, though most legislation considered by the Parliament is proposed by the government.

=== Senate ===
The Senate (&quot;Senat&quot;) has 47 members, 40 of whom are elected for six-year terms in double-seat constituencies by the local assemblies, half renewed every two years, and 7 presidential appointees. In addition, former presidents are &quot;ex officio&quot; senators for life.

==Judicial branch==
There are 65 judges on the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which sits on top of the judicial hierarchy. Kazakhstan&#x27;s judiciary also consists of courts of general jurisdiction, criminal courts, which handle grave crimes, juvenile courts, economic courts, administrative offenses courts, and administrative justice courts (the last of which was created in 2021). There is an eleven-member Constitutional Court (set up in 2022), even though formally this tribunal is not a part of the judicial branch. With regard to the legal profession, the Republican Collegiate was created in 2012 and it represents Kazakhstan&#x27;s lawyers&#x27; associations on the national level.

==Administrative divisions==
Kazakhstan is divided into 16 regions and the three municipal regions (cities of republican significance) of Almaty, Astana, and Shymkent. Each is headed by an akim (provincial governor) appointed by the president. Municipal akims are appointed by province akims. The Government of Kazakhstan transferred its capital from Almaty to Astana on 10 June 1998. The regions or &quot;oblystar&quot; (singular — &quot;oblys&quot;) and cities (&quot;qalalar&quot;, singular — &quot;qala&quot;)* are : Abai (Semey), Almaty (Qonayev), Almaty*, Akmola (Kokshetau), Astana*, Aktobe (Aktobe), Atyrau (Atyrau), West Kazakhstan (Oral), Baykonur*, Mangystau (Aktau), Shymkent*, Turkistan (Turkistan), Pavlodar (Pavlodar), Karagandy (Karaganda), Kostanay (Kostanay), Kyzylorda (Kyzylorda), East Kazakhstan (Oskemen), North Kazakhstan (Petropavl), Jambyl (Taraz), Jetisu (Taldykorgan), and Ulytau (Jezkazgan). The administrative divisions have the same names as their administrative centers (exceptions have the administrative center name following in parentheses); in 1995, the Governments of Kazakhstan and Russia entered into an agreement whereby Russia would lease for a period of 20 years an area of enclosing the Baikonur space launch facilities and the city of Baikonur.

<doc id="77879" wikidata="Q7408851" url="?curid=77879" title="Samaritans (charity)">
<text>Samaritans is a registered charity aimed at providing emotional support to anyone in emotional distress, struggling to cope or at risk of suicide throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland, often through its telephone helpline. Its name derives from the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan, although the organisation itself is not religious.

Its international network exists under the name Befrienders Worldwide, which is part of the Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines (VESH) with Lifeline International and the International Federation of Telephone Emergency Services (IFOTES).

==History==

Samaritans was founded in 1953 by the Rev. Chad Varah, a Church of England vicar in the Diocese of London. His inspiration came from an experience he had had some years earlier as a young curate in the Diocese of Lincoln. He had taken a funeral for a fourteen-year old girl who had died by suicide because she believed she had contracted an STD, when in reality she was menstruating. Varah placed an advertisement in a newspaper encouraging people to volunteer at his church, listening to people contemplating suicide.

The movement grew rapidly: within ten years there were 40 branches and now there are 201 branches across Great Britain and Ireland, deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise political or sectarian divisions. Samaritans offers support through over 21,200 trained volunteers (2015) and is entirely dependent on voluntary support. The name was not originally chosen by Chad Varah: it was part of a headline to an article in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper on 7 December 1953 about Varah&#x27;s work.

In 1972, BBC1 ran an 11-episode television series called &quot;The Befrienders&quot;, featuring fictional stories about people in desperate situations who reach out to the Samaritans. Although it was cancelled after one season, the series helped to raise public awareness about their work, leading to a significant increase in inbound calls, as well as a surge in the number of volunteers in the UK.

In 2004, Samaritans announced that volunteer numbers had reached a thirty-year low, and launched a campaign to recruit more young people (specifically targeted at ages 18–24) to become volunteers. The campaign was fronted by Phil Selway, drummer with the band Radiohead, himself a Samaritans volunteer.

In 2004, Chad Varah announced that he had become disillusioned with Samaritans. He said, &quot;It&#x27;s no longer what I founded. I founded an organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It was no longer to be an emergency service, it was to be emotional support&quot;. One in five calls to Samaritans is from someone with suicidal feelings. Samaritans&#x27; vision is that fewer people will die by suicide.

In 2005, a rapprochement was reached when Varah met with the new chief executive, and then chairman, of The Samaritans and enjoyed hearing about the continued essential and enlightened work Varah had begun in 1953. In 2006, Varah&#x27;s eldest son, Michael Varah, was appointed to sit on the newly created board of trustees.

==Services==

The core of Samaritans&#x27; work is a telephone helpline, operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Samaritans was the first 24-hour telephone helpline to be set up in the UK. In addition, the organisation offers a drop-in service for face-to-face discussion, undertakes outreach at festivals and other outdoor events, trains prisoners as &quot;Listeners&quot; to provide support within prisons, and undertakes research into suicide and emotional health issues.

Since 1994, Samaritans has also offered confidential email support. Initially operating from one branch, the service is now provided by 198 branches and co-ordinated from the organisation&#x27;s head office. In 2011, Samaritans received over 206,000 emails, including many from outside the UK, and aims to answer each one within 24 hours.

Samaritans is currently piloting a webchat service to allow correspondents to communicate with listening volunteers by instant message.

In 2009, Ofcom introduced the first harmonised European numbers for harmonised services of social value, allocating 116 123 to Samaritans. This number is free to call from mobiles and landlines. From 22 September 2015, Samaritans has promoted 116123 as its main number, replacing the chargeable 0845 number previously advertised.

In 2014, Samaritans received 5,100,000 calls for help by phone, email, text, letter, minicom, Typetalk, face-to-face at a branch, through its work in prisons, and at local and national festivals and other events.

Samaritans volunteers are given rigorous training to be non-judgmental and empathetic. By listening and asking open questions, Samaritans volunteers try to help people explore their feelings and work out their own way forward.

Samaritans does not denounce suicide, and it is not necessary to be suicidal to contact Samaritans. In 2014, nearly 80% of the people calling Samaritans did not express suicidal feelings. Samaritans believes that offering people the opportunity to be listened to in confidence, and accepted without prejudice, can alleviate despair and make emotional health a mainstream issue.

In 2022, Samaritans campaigned to have &quot;suicide websites&quot; shut down; stating that it believed that the UK government&#x27;s proposed online safety bill &quot;isn&#x27;t fit for purpose&quot;. Smaller &quot;pro-suicide&quot; websites which can push people to commit suicide are the charity&#x27;s biggest concern in this area.

=== Media guidelines ===
In 2013, following extensive consultation with journalists and editors throughout the industry, Samaritans produced a set of guidelines outlining best practice when reporting suicide. Since its publication, the organisation has received many awards in recognition of its work influencing the way in which suicide is reported.

==Confidentiality==
Samaritans have a strict code of caller confidentiality, even after the death of a caller. Unless the caller gives consent to pass on information, confidentiality will be broken only in rare circumstances, such as when Samaritans receives bomb or terrorism warnings, to call an ambulance because a caller appears to be incapable of making rational decisions, when the caller is threatening volunteers or deliberately preventing the service being delivered to other callers, or when there is a safeguarding concern.

In November 2011, the Board of Trustees agreed a motion breaking with confidentiality in Ireland, &quot;To provide confidential support to children but report to the Health Service Executive any contacts (from either adults or children) where it appears a child is experiencing specific situations such as those that can cause them serious harm from themselves or others.&quot;

In 2011, Facebook collaborated with Samaritans to offer help to people in distress. This led to &#x27;cold case&#x27; calling, which some believed was an infringement on people&#x27;s privacy. An Irish journalist wrote of her experience of receiving such a communication.

==International reach==

Through its email service, Samaritans&#x27; work has extended well beyond the UK and Ireland, as messages are received from all around the world.

Samaritans&#x27; international reach is through Befrienders Worldwide, an organisation of over 400 centres in 38 countries offering similar activities. Samaritans took on and renamed the Befrienders International network in 2003, a year after it collapsed. Some members of Befrienders Worldwide also use the name Samaritans; this includes centres in Hong Kong, India, Serbia, the United States and Zimbabwe.

The Volunteer Emotional Support Helplines (VESH) combines Samaritans (through Befrienders Worldwide) with the other two largest international services (IFOTES &amp; Lifeline), and plans a combined international network of helplines. In their roles as emotional support service networks, they have all agreed to develop a more effective and robust international interface.

==Similar charities==

A number of other helplines exist that offer a similar service to Samaritans. These are often aimed at a specific sector/group of people.

One example is Nightline, a student-run listening and information services, based at universities across the country, offer a night time support service for students. Each service is run specifically for students at a particular university/geographical area, and most Nightlines are members of the Nightline Association, a registered charity in England, Wales and Scotland.

Shout is a free mental health helpline in the United Kingdom, providing the UK&#x27;s first 24/7 text message support service for people who are struggling to cope.

In the UK, the ChildLine service operated by the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) is similar to the Samaritans helpline in some ways, but offers support for children only. A similar service, also called Childline, is operated in Ireland by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC).

Another example is Aware, a national voluntary organisation, based in Ireland, which provides supports to individuals who experience depression with their families and friends. It provides a Helpline service, as well as nationwide Support Groups and monthly lectures, which seek to educate and increase awareness of depression.

<text>Zinedine Yazid Zidane (; &quot;Zineddin Lyazid Zidan&quot;; ; born 23 June 1972), popularly known as Zizou, is a French professional football manager and former player who played as an attacking midfielder. He most recently coached La Liga club Real Madrid and is one of the most successful coaches in the world. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Zidane was a playmaker renowned for his elegance, vision, passing, and ball control. He received many individual accolades as a player, including being named FIFA World Player of the Year in 1998, 2000 and 2003, and winning the 1998 Ballon d&#x27;Or.

Zidane started his career at Cannes, before establishing himself as one of the best players in the French Ligue 1 at Bordeaux. In 1996, he moved to Italian club Juventus, where he won several trophies, including two Serie A titles. He moved to Real Madrid for a world record fee at the time of €77.5 million in 2001, which remained a record for the next eight years. In Spain, Zidane won several trophies, including a La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League. In the 2002 Champions League final, he scored a left-foot volleyed winner that is considered one of the greatest goals in football history. In 2012 and 2017, respectively, Zidane was named in Real Madrid&#x27;s and Juventus&#x27; greatest XI of all time.

Capped 108 times by France, Zidane won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, scoring a brace in the final, and was named in the All-Star team. This triumph made him a national hero in France and he received the Legion of Honour in 1998. He won UEFA Euro 2000 and was named Player of the Tournament. He also received the Golden Ball as Player of the Tournament at the 2006 World Cup, despite his infamous sending off in the final against Italy for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest. He retired as the fourth-most capped player in French history.

In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players compiled by Pelé, and in the same year was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. Zidane is one of nine players to have won the World Cup, the Champions League, and the Ballon d&#x27;Or. He was the ambassador for Qatar&#x27;s successful bid to stage the 2022 World Cup, the first Arab country to host the tournament.

After retiring as a player, Zidane began his coaching career at Real Madrid Castilla. He remained in the position for two years, before managing the first team in 2016. In his initial three seasons, Zidane became the first coach to win the Champions League three times in a row. He also won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup twice each, as well as a La Liga title and a Supercopa de España. This success led to Zidane being named Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Coach in 2017. He resigned in 2018, but returned to the club in 2019, and won another La Liga title and a Supercopa de España, before leaving again in 2021.

==Early life and career==


Zinedine Yazid Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane, Marseille, in Southern France. He is the youngest of five siblings. Zidane is of Algerian descent and has described himself as a &quot;non-practising Muslim&quot;. His parents, Smaïl and Malika, immigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber-speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War. The family, which had settled in the city&#x27;s tough northern districts of Barbès and Saint-Denis, found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of La Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille. In an interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, he stated:

His father worked as a warehouseman and security guard at a department store, often on the night shift, while his mother was a housewife. The family lived a reasonably comfortable life by the standards of the neighbourhood, which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates. Zidane credits his strict upbringing and his father as the &quot;guiding light&quot; in his career.

It was in Castellane where Zidane had his earliest introduction in football, joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood&#x27;s children played on the Place Tartane, an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex. In July 2011, Zidane named former Marseille players Blaž Slišković, Enzo Francescoli and Jean-Pierre Papin as his idols while growing up. At the age of ten, Zidane got his first player&#x27;s licence after joining the junior team of a local club from Castellane by the name of US Saint-Henri. After spending a year and a half at US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined SO Septèmes-les-Vallons when the Septèmes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club&#x27;s Director to get Zidane. Zidane stayed with Septèmes until the age of 14, at which time he was selected to attend a three-day training camp at the CREPS (Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education) in Aix-en-Provence, one of several such footballing institutes run by the French Football Federation. It was here that Zidane was spotted by AS Cannes scout and former player Jean Varraud, who recommended him to the training centre director of the club. As a 14-year-old watching the 1986 World Cup, the performance of Diego Maradona left an indelible mark on him, with Zidane stating Maradona &quot;was on another level&quot;.

==Club career==
===Cannes===

Zidane went to Cannes for a six-week stay, but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level. Having left his family to join Cannes, he was invited by Cannes Director Jean-Claude Elineau to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that, while living with the Elineaus, he found equilibrium.

It was at Cannes where Zidane&#x27;s first coaches noticed that he was raw and sensitive, prone to attack spectators who insulted his race or family. His first coach, Jean Varraud, encouraged him to channel his anger and focus on his own game. Zidane spent his first weeks at Cannes mainly on cleaning duty as a punishment for punching an opponent who mocked his ghetto origins. The occasional violence that he would display throughout his career was shaped by an internal conflict of being an Algerian-Frenchman suspended between cultures, and surviving the tough streets of La Castellane where he grew up.

Zidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 in a French Division 1 match against Nantes. He scored his first goal for the club on 10 February 1991 also against Nantes in a 2–1 win. After the match, during a party for all the Cannes players, Zidane was given a car by Cannes chairman Alain Pedretti, who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club. On the pitch, Zidane displayed extraordinary technique on the ball, offering glimpses of the talent that would take him to the top of the world game. In his first full season with Cannes, the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the UEFA Cup, after finishing fourth in the league. This remains the club&#x27;s highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948–49 season.

===Bordeaux===
Zidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992–93 season, winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup after beating Karlsruher SC and finishing runner-up against Bayern Munich in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup during his four years with the club. He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied, &quot;Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?&quot; Also toward the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for £1.2 million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division. In 1996, Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year.

===Juventus===

After a series of stand out performances for both Bordeaux and France, Zidane had offers to join Europe&#x27;s top clubs in the spring of 1996, deciding on a move to UEFA Champions League winners Juventus during the close season. Zidane&#x27;s impact in Italy was immediate, winning the 1996–97 Serie A title and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup. He was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year in his first season. Zidane&#x27;s growing status in the sport saw him chosen in a European XI to face a World XI – featuring a forward line of Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta – in December 1997.

As the playmaker at Juve, Zidane played just behind forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Del Piero recalling, &quot;Zidane had an extraordinary talent, which contributed to his sole interest in helping the team. He was not a selfish player. He had a unique ability to be a great and to be a team player. I was lucky to play with him.&quot; He lost in the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final 3–1 to Borussia Dortmund when he was unable to make an impression against the close marking of Paul Lambert.

The following season, Zidane scored seven goals in 32 matches in the league to help Juventus win the 1997–98 Serie A and thus retain the &quot;Scudetto&quot;. In Europe, Juventus made their third consecutive UEFA Champions League Final appearance, but lost the game 1–0 to Real Madrid. In 1998, Zidane was named FIFA World Player of the Year, and won the Ballon d&#x27;Or. Juventus finished second in the 2000–01 Serie A, but were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, after Zidane was banned for head-butting Hamburger SV player Jochen Kientz. In 2001, Zidane was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second time.

===Real Madrid===
In 2001, Zidane joined Real Madrid for a world record fee of 150 billion Italian lire, (about €77.5 million by fixed exchange rate; a reported 12.8 billion pesetas) in instalments, and signed a four-year contract. The latest addition to the &quot;Galácticos&quot; era of global stars signed by Real Madrid every year, in his first season at the club Zidane scored a famous match-winning goal, a volley hit with his weaker left foot from the edge of the 18-yard box, in Madrid&#x27;s 2–1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final. The goal has been cited as one of the greatest in Champions League history. The magnitude of the strike saw Zidane produce one of his most emotional goal celebrations as he ran toward the touchline with mouth wide open, screaming in delight.


The next season, Zidane helped Real Madrid to win the 2002–03 La Liga, starring alongside Luís Figo in midfield, and was named the FIFA World Player of the Year for the third time. In 2004, fans voted him as the best European footballer of the previous 50 years in UEFA&#x27;s fiftieth-anniversary Golden Jubilee Poll.

While Zidane&#x27;s final season of club football ended without a trophy, he enjoyed success on a personal note by scoring his first hat-trick, against Sevilla, in a 4–2 win in January 2006. He ended the season for Real Madrid as their second highest goalscorer and assists provider behind teammates Ronaldo and David Beckham respectively, with nine goals and ten assists in 28 games. On 7 May 2006, Zidane, who had announced his plans to retire after the 2006 World Cup, played his farewell match and scored in a 3–3 draw with Villarreal. The squad wore commemorative shirts with &quot;ZIDANE 2001–2006&quot; below the club logo. The 80,000 fans inside the Santiago Bernabéu held up a banner reading, &quot;Thanks for the magic.&quot;

In 2012, Zidane featured for Madrid in an All Stars Match against Manchester United which resulted in a 3–2 win for Real. In April 2013, he was named by &quot;Marca&quot; as a member of the &quot;Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid&#x27;s history.&quot;

==International career==
Both France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen. It was rumoured that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough. Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.

Zidane was a member of the French under-21 squad that won a bronze medal at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Languedoc-Roussillon.
He earned his first cap with France as a substitute in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2–2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2–0 deficit. After Eric Cantona was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position.

===Euro 1996===
Despite not being at his best during the tournament, France reached the last four. Zidane was not yet fully established in the French team and his level was quite average during the whole event, but he managed to score in the penalty shootout in both the quarter-final and semi-final. France was eliminated in the Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout against the Czech Republic.

===1998 World Cup===
The 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in; the tournament was held in his home country, France. The French team won all three games in the group stage, with Zidane setting up Christophe Dugarry&#x27;s goal in the opening match against South Africa from a corner, and contributing to Thierry Henry&#x27;s opening goal in the second match against Saudi Arabia. He was sent off in the latter match for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup Finals match. Without their playmaker, France proceeded to win 1–0 in the round of sixteen game against Paraguay and, on his return to the side, defeated Italy 4–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter-finals, with Zidane netting the first spot kick in the shoot-out. France then defeated Croatia 2–1 in the semi-final. Although Zidane had played a role in the team&#x27;s accomplishments, he had yet to score a goal at the World Cup.

Zidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final. France dominated Brazil from the kick-off, with Zidane scoring two similar goals, both headers from corner kicks taken by Emmanuel Petit and Youri Djorkaeff. Courtesy of Zidane&#x27;s two goals, France went into the half-time break 2–0 up with one hand on the World Cup trophy. Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3–0 win and France&#x27;s first World Cup. Named man of the match, Zidane became an instant national hero and would receive the Legion of Honour later that year. More than one million people lined the Champs-Élysées in Paris, with celebrations centred around the Arc de Triomphe.

===Euro 2000===
Two years later France won Euro 2000, becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since West Germany in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a bending free kick against Spain in the quarter-final and the golden goal in the semi-final against Portugal with a penalty. He also set-up Henry&#x27;s goal in a 3–0 win over Denmark in their opening group match. UEFA named Zidane Player of the Tournament.

Zidane himself believes he was at his peak during the tournament, while the UEFA website states, &quot;In Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane dominated a major championship in a way no individual had managed since Diego Maradona in 1986. From the opening game against Denmark to the final against Italy, &#x27;Zizou&#x27; shone brightly, casting a spell on his opponents with clever flicks, mesmerising stepovers, slaloming runs and masterful vision.&quot;

===2002 World Cup===
As reigning world and European champions, France entered the 2002 World Cup in Japan/Korea as favourites but a thigh injury sustained in a warm up match before the tournament prevented Zidane from playing in France&#x27;s first two matches and without their talisman, the French team failed to score in either match, losing 1–0 against Senegal, and holding Uruguay to a goalless draw. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game against Denmark, despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from losing 2–0, and being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.

===Euro 2004===
At Euro 2004, France topped their group with wins over England and Switzerland. In the opening match against England, Zidane scored a free kick and penalty in stoppage time to turn impending defeat into a 2–1 victory. In the following group match against Croatia, his free-kick was deflected by defender Igor Tudor, who scored an own goal; the match ended in a 2–2 draw. In France&#x27;s final group match, Zidane opened the scoring in an eventual 3–1 win over Switzerland. However, France were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual champions Greece in a surprise 1–0 loss. After France&#x27;s elimination, Zidane announced his retirement from international football.

===2006 World Cup===
With the mass retirement of veteran key players such as Bixente Lizarazu, Marcel Desailly, Claude Makélélé and Lilian Thuram, France struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. At the urging of coach Raymond Domenech, Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately reinstated as team captain. Zidane, along with Thuram and Makélélé, made his competitive return for France in a 3–0 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 September 2005. The trio helped France rise from fourth place to win their qualifying group. On 27 May 2006, Zidane earned his hundredth cap for France in a 1–0 friendly win over Mexico, in what would also be his last match at the Stade de France. Zidane became France&#x27;s fourth player to reach 100 caps, after Desailly, Thuram and Didier Deschamps.

France had a slow start to the 2006 Finals and, after being suspended for the third match of the group stage, Zidane returned to set up a goal for Patrick Vieira and score one himself in the second round match against Spain. In the quarter-final France held Brazil to just one shot on goal in the rematch of the 1998 final. Zidane assisted Thierry Henry&#x27;s deciding goal and was named Man of the Match by FIFA. France faced Portugal in the semi-final and, as in Brussels six years earlier; once again, Zidane&#x27;s penalty kick decided the contest and sent France to another major final.

Having already announced he was to retire after the expiration of his Real Madrid contract at the end of the 2005–06 season, the world of football already knew Zidane&#x27;s second World Cup final was to be the last match of his career. Seven minutes into the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin, Zidane put France ahead with a Panenka-style penalty kick which struck the crossbar and bounced just over the goal line to become only the fourth player in World Cup history to score in two different finals, along with Pelé, Paul Breitner, and Vavá, in addition to being tied for first place with Vavá, Pelé and Geoff Hurst with three World Cup final goals apiece, a record at the time, later broken by compatriot Kylian Mbappé in 2022. He almost scored a second goal during the first period of extra time but his header was saved by Italy&#x27;s goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Zidane was then sent off in the 110th minute of the game after headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest, so he did not participate in the penalty shootout, which Italy won 5–3. This marked the 14th overall expulsion of Zidane&#x27;s career, and joined him with Cameroon&#x27;s Rigobert Song as the only players ever to be sent off during two separate World Cup tournaments. Something curious about Zidane&#x27;s expulsion was that the referee didn&#x27;t even see the headbutting, so he went to ask the linesmen, who didn&#x27;t see anything either. But the fourth referee did see the play, and convinced of his expression, he sent off the 10th of the French team. He also became the fourth player red-carded in a World Cup final, in addition to being the first sent off in extra time. Zidane&#x27;s actions made headlines all over the world, while in France &quot;Le Figaro&quot; called his head-butt &quot;odious&quot;, and the front page of &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; asked, &quot;What should we tell our children, for whom you have become an example for ever? ... How could that happen to a man like you?&quot; Zidane had received plaudits for his performances during the tournament, with Pep Guardiola writing he exerts so much influence on the team that &quot;France are never disorganised&quot;. The day after the final, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament.

Upon his return to France, the Place de la Concorde in Paris was filled with thousands of fans waving flags and rhythmically chanting &quot;Zizou! Zizou!&quot;, and tributes were led by the French president Jacques Chirac. Chirac&#x27;s words reflected the feeling of the French public, with polls done in the immediate wake of the incident showing support for Zidane: 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them. According to French journalist Philippe Auclair, Zidane&#x27;s performances in the knock-out rounds were &quot;ranked among his finest in a blue shirt.&quot; As the player of the tournament, Zidane had given the team hope, with the French daily newspaper &quot;Libération&quot; stating, &quot;For a month, France was dreaming with Zidane.&quot; Zidane remained an icon to the French public, and one French writer stated, &quot;It&#x27;s good for us to see our national hero is fallible.&quot; It was later revealed through interviews that Marco Materazzi had insulted Zidane&#x27;s sister, which led to Zidane&#x27;s heightened anger and reaction. In 2010, Zidane said that he would &quot;rather die than apologize&quot; to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final, but also admitted that he &quot;could never have lived with himself&quot; had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match. He later said, &quot;If you look at the fourteen red cards I had in my career, twelve of them were a result of provocation. This isn&#x27;t justification, this isn&#x27;t an excuse, but my passion, temper and blood made me react.&quot;

Following his red card in the final, Zidane retired from professional football and confirmed that he would not go back on his decision. He was sentenced by FIFA to complete three days of community service with children in one of FIFA&#x27;s humanitarian projects rather than three-match suspension for the red card given that he already retired. Zidane ended up tying with Brazil&#x27;s Cafu for the record for most cards given in World Cup matches, with six.

==Retirement==
Since his retirement, Zidane has regularly played for the Real Madrid Veterans team. He has also made several futsal appearances. In 2015 he played in a futsal tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during which an opposition player received a yellow card to much amusement for taking an in-match selfie with Zidane. In an interview in June 2008, Zidane stated that he wanted to return to football, but that he had no immediate plans to do so.

On 1 June 2009, Zidane was announced as the advisor to the president after Florentino Pérez was named president of Real Madrid for the second time. He, along with general director Jorge Valdano and sporting director Miguel Pardeza, were to be the key decisionmakers on the sporting side of the club. After France&#x27;s dismal campaign in the 2010 World Cup, Zidane said that he did not plan to move into coaching any time soon.

Qatar&#x27;s 2022 World Cup bid committee announced in September 2010 that Zidane had been appointed as an ambassador for Qatar&#x27;s attempt to host the 2022 World Cup. After FIFA announced on 2 December 2010 that Qatar had won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Zidane stated that he was &quot;very pleased&quot; with the outcome. Zidane spoke of the message he was trying to convey in the campaign: &quot;I was saying that football belonged to the whole world. I&#x27;m proud to have made my contribution to a new country getting the World Cup. Qatar and the entire Middle East as a whole deserves this event and that makes me happy. It&#x27;s a victory for the Arab world.&quot; Zidane has supported two Olympic bids for Paris, including the 2012 Summer Olympics which was narrowly won by London and later Paris&#x27; successful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Paris also hosted the 2024 Summer Paralympics.

===Philanthropy===
On 24 February 2007, before a crowd of 10,000 fans at a match in northern Thailand for the Keuydaroon children&#x27;s AIDS charity, Zidane scored the first goal and set up the second for a Malaysian teammate as the match ended 2–2. The event raised ฿260,000 ($7,750). This money paid for the building of two schools and 16 three-bedroom houses.

On 19 November 2008, Zidane took part in the fifth annual Match Against Poverty in Málaga, Spain, which also ended in a 2–2 draw; he went scoreless but set up his team&#x27;s second goal. He and Ronaldo, who collaborated in conceiving the yearly event to benefit the United Nations Development Programme, regularly captain their respective teams consisting of active footballers, other professional athletes and celebrities. Zidane, a UN Goodwill Ambassador since 2001, stated before the game that &quot;everyone can do something to make the world a better place.&quot;

In June and July 2009, Zidane toured across Canada with stops in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Although billed as Zidane and &quot;Friends&quot;, the likes of which included Fabien Barthez and Samuel Eto&#x27;o, the exhibition matches featured local players. Some proceeds were given to UNICEF.

On 6 June 2010, Zidane took part in the biennial charity event Soccer Aid. He played for the Rest of the World team, managed by former Liverpool and Celtic forward Kenny Dalglish against England alongside former Real Madrid teammate Luís Figo and Celtic legend Henrik Larsson. He played against former players such as Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer, as well as celebrities such as Hollywood actors Woody Harrelson, Mike Myers, Michael Sheen, chef Gordon Ramsay, actor Damian Lewis and singer Robbie Williams. The match took place at Old Trafford, Manchester and was won by the Rest of the World for the first time, the winning penalty scored by Harrelson after a 2–2 draw.

On 2 June 2013, Zidane took part in a charity match played at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United Legends vs. Real Madrid Legends reverse fixture. The first leg took place in Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Part of a team that included the likes of Figo, Fernando Redondo and Manolo Sanchís, the fixture raised funds for the Manchester United Foundation. The 12th Match against Poverty took place in Saint-Étienne, France, on Monday 20 April 2015, where Ronaldo and Zidane teamed up with other football stars against past and present players of French Ligue 1 club AS Saint-Étienne. According to UNDP, &quot;two-thirds of all proceeds will go toward helping the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone build back better from the Ebola epidemic.&quot; In June 2018, Zidane reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star side which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. In a 3–2 win for France, Thierry Henry played a no-look one-two pass with Zidane before scoring, with Zidane then curling in a 25-yard free kick.

==Coaching career==
In November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid&#x27;s first team in response to an appeal made by then-Real Madrid coach José Mourinho for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane was expected to participate in Champions League events and functions and was also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach. In July 2011, it was announced that he would become Real Madrid&#x27;s new sporting director. In 2013, Zidane was appointed assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.

===Real Madrid Castilla===
In June 2014, Real Madrid announced that Zidane would be the coach of Real Madrid&#x27;s B team, Real Madrid Castilla. On 29 August, the director of the Spanish National Football Coach Education Centre (CENAFE), Miguel Galán, reported Zidane for acting as Real Madrid Castilla&#x27;s head coach without the necessary coaching badges. According to Galán, &quot;No one who has anything to do with the football world can be unaware that Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla&#x27;s head coach this season. It is a fait accompli that has been widely accepted, as shown by media reports, and Real Madrid do not deny it.&quot; While the official match report for Castilla&#x27;s opening game in the Segunda División B lists Santiago Sánchez as the &quot;Los Blancos&quot;&#x27; head coach and Zidane as his assistant, Galán states, &quot;This hierarchy only exists on paper. The truth is the exact opposite: Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla&#x27;s head coach, while, with all due respect to him as a colleague, Mr Sánchez&#x27;s role basically boils down to providing the badges.&quot;

===Real Madrid===
On 4 January 2016, Real Madrid announced the dismissal of Rafael Benítez and on the same day Zidane was appointed the new head coach of the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal. His first match as the club&#x27;s new manager took place five days later, when Real Madrid beat Deportivo La Coruña 5–0 in a La Liga match. In his first &quot;El Clásico&quot; as a coach, held on 2 April at the Camp Nou, Zidane led his club to a 2–1 win over Barcelona, ending Barça&#x27;s 39-match unbeaten run. On 4 May, Zidane led Real Madrid to a place in the Champions League final by beating Manchester City 1–0 on aggregate. In La Liga, Madrid ended up finishing second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona. On 28 May, Real Madrid&#x27;s eleventh Champions League title was won after a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over Atlético Madrid, with the achievement being termed &quot;&quot;La Undécima&quot;. Zidane became the seventh man to win the European Cup both as a player and a coach and the second man (after Miguel Muñoz) to achieve the feat with Real Madrid. He also became the first French coach, except the French-Argentinian Helenio Herrera, to win the trophy.

Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane&#x27;s first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla. On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record. On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona&#x27;s Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season. Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later. The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. In May of that year, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process. On 3 June 2017, the club&#x27;s Champions League final win against Juventus resulted in Real Madrid being the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup. Real Madrid&#x27;s title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as &quot;La Duodécima&quot;&quot;. With Real&#x27;s Champions League victory, Zidane became only the second manager to win the European Cup in his first two seasons in management, alongside fellow Real Madrid coach José Villalonga.

Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in &quot;El Clásico&quot; matches and winning the second trophy of the season. This title tied Zidane with Vicente del Bosque as the third most successful Real Madrid coach with seven titles, one short of Luis Molowny. This also meant that, at the time, Zidane had won as many titles in his coaching position in Real Madrid as games lost during his tenure. Zidane&#x27;s success saw him named Best FIFA Men&#x27;s Coach in 2017. On 16 December 2017, Zidane won his eighth trophy as coach as Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy. On 24 January 2018, Madrid was knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the quarter-final stage by Leganés on away goals. The team&#x27;s league campaign was also a disappointment as Real collected only 76 points and finished third, 17 points behind champions Barcelona. Madrid fared far better in the Champions League, once again progressing to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. At that time, he became one of three managers, alongside Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti, to win the European Cup three times, while also becoming the first coach to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons. On 31 May, five days after the Champions League final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid coach, citing the club&#x27;s &quot;need for change&quot; as his rationale for departing.

===Return to Real Madrid===
Following some poor results for Real Madrid in the months following Zidane&#x27;s departure – culminating in elimination from the Copa del Rey at home to Barcelona, a league loss to the same opponent at the same venue which opened up a 12-point gap between the clubs, and an unexpected home 4–1 defeat to Ajax in the Champions League which brought the long run of success in that competition to an end, all within the space of a week – his former teammate Santiago Solari (who himself had only been in the post for five months, after Julen Lopetegui&#x27;s equally brief spell in charge) was dismissed and Zidane returned as the Real Madrid head coach on 11 March 2019, on a contract until summer 2022.

The 2019–20 season seemed a promising one, as Madrid went on a spending spree in the summer of 2019, signing Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million. On 12 January 2020, Zidane guided Madrid to their first trophy in his second spell, with the club defeating cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final. After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team&#x27;s 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total. It was Zidane&#x27;s second league title in his coaching career. His collective mindset was hailed by international and Spanish media, as Real Madrid broke several records, including the number of scorers and maintaining their best league defensive record in 30 years, with 21 of his players managing to get on the scoresheet during the campaign. Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season.

He was approached to become coach of the United States after the end of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but declined.

==Reception and legacy==
===As a player===
Many football legends have acclaimed Zidane&#x27;s skills and importance in the history of the sport, such as Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who called Zidane &quot;a monster&quot; for his performance and abilities. German coach Franz Beckenbauer stated, &quot;Zidane is one of the greatest players in history, a truly magnificent player.&quot; Italy manager Marcello Lippi, who also coached Zidane, opined, &quot;I think Zidane is the greatest talent we&#x27;ve known in football these last twenty years.&quot; Former England manager Kevin Keegan said, &quot;You look at Zidane and think &#x27;I&#x27;ve never seen a player quite like that.&#x27; What sets Zidane apart is the way he manipulates a football, buying himself space that isn&#x27;t there. Add his vision and it makes him very special.&quot; At the 1998 World Cup, Italian manager Cesare Maldini said, &quot;I would give up five players to have Zidane in my squad.&quot;

Among his playing peers, Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimović commented, &quot;Zidane was from another planet. When Zidane stepped onto the pitch, the ten other guys just got suddenly better. It is that simple.&quot; David Beckham has described Zidane as &quot;the greatest of all time&quot;, Barcelona star Xavi has stated in a 2010 interview that Zidane was &quot;best player in the &#x27;90s and early 2000s&quot;, while Brazilian defender and former Real Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos has said of Zidane, &quot;He is the best player I&#x27;ve seen. Supporters arrived earlier at the Bernabéu just to see him warm-up.&quot; Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho stated, &quot;Zidane is one of the best footballers of all time, one of my idols. He had such elegance and grace, a wonderful touch and superb vision.&quot; Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard regards Zidane as &quot;the best ever&quot;, and growing up he learned from his idol by &quot;watching him on television and online for hours.&quot;

Displaying skills with an array of moves such as his signature &quot;La Roulette&quot; pirouette, step overs, and close ball control, former Brazilian international Rivaldo stated, &quot;His elegance of movement on the pitch and his skills are uncanny.&quot; Journalist Sid Lowe wrote, &quot;Zidane was football&#x27;s answer to the Bolshoi Ballet. Zidane was elegance above all else.&quot; In 2005, upon Zidane&#x27;s return to the French national team, his teammate Thierry Henry stated, &quot;In France, everybody realized that God exists, and that he is back in the French international team.&quot; Zidane has been lauded by sportsmen outside football; having witnessed Zidane&#x27;s goal against Deportivo La Coruña in January 2002, where he dragged the ball right then left, turning the defender inside out, before scoring with a left foot finish, basketball player Magic Johnson stated, &quot;One of the most inspiring nights of my life. Zidane is a phenomenon.&quot;

Labelled a &quot;flawed genius&quot; by ESPN, Zidane possessed an exceptional first touch, and was also known for his dribbling skills and elegance on the ball. He was capable of using either foot, despite being naturally right-footed. His technique and co-ordination enabled him to execute shots and volleys with extreme power and precision, in particular from outside the penalty area; he was also a free kick and penalty kick specialist. A renowned playmaker, Zidane&#x27;s natural position was a classic number 10 behind the strikers. He was also capable of playing as a second striker, as a winger, or as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker, due to his ability to orchestrate his team&#x27;s attacking plays from deep with his vision and passing. Thus, he was capable of both assisting and scoring goals, despite being neither the most prolific goalscorer. While not known for his heading ability, his height and physical strength also allowed him to be effective in the air, and saw him score several crucial headers throughout his career. He also drew praise from his managers for his defensive work-rate. Despite not being the quickest player, he possessed good agility and acceleration. He also had excellent positioning and outstanding spatial awareness. Although he had a reserved and humble character, his former Juventus managers Lippi and Ancelotti also praised Zidane for being a team player, on whom his teammates could rely. Notwithstanding the acclaim that Zidane received from the media over his playing ability, he also drew criticism in the media over his temperament and discipline, and for his occasional violent conduct on the pitch, which led to Zidane picking up cards; he was also accused by the media for drifting in and out of games and for lacking leadership qualities, although he was able to establish himself as a consistent and decisive player, who was also an influential captain at international level throughout his career.

Zidane has been named FIFA World Player of the Year three times, a feat achieved only by Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. In 2002, ESPN described Zidane as &quot;the greatest player in the world in the world&#x27;s biggest game&quot;. In a 2002 FIFA poll, Zidane was selected in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team. In 2004, he was voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years, and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players. In a 2004 poll conducted by French newspaper &quot;Journal du Dimanche&quot;, Zidane was voted as &quot;the most popular Frenchman of all time&quot;. In 2014, in a poll carried out by French TV channel TF1, Zidane was voted as the best player in the history of the French league. In 2016, in a study led by French newspaper &quot;Le Parisien&quot;, Zidane was named &quot;best French player of all time&quot;.

===As a coach===
Despite establishing himself as one of the most successful coaches of his era and in the history of Real Madrid, Zidane&#x27;s time at Real Madrid was considered by some to be shadowed by a partial amount of luck. His tactical philosophy has been praised by many. Zidane&#x27;s tactical style, characterized by its formation flexibility and attacking football, as well as his ability to unite the dressing room, have been positively compared to Carlo Ancelotti&#x27;s coaching method. His use of in-game substitutions was particularly praised, as many of his substitutes led to victories, such as introducing Marco Asensio and Lucas Vázquez in order to provide pace and width against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1–0 deficit into a 3–1 victory. Similarly, his use of Gareth Bale as a substitute in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final proved crucial; Bale scored two goals after being brought on, turning a 1–1 tie into a 3–1 Madrid victory. It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks, while he is credited for repopularising the 4–4–2 diamond formation in contemporary football.

On the other hand, some consider that Zidane&#x27;s role was more focused in grinding out results and uniting the dressing room, rather than having a fixed tactical scheme. Zidane emphasised the importance of players&#x27; physical levels and preferred to choose impactful players over a defined system. During his time at Real Madrid, he used several formations, including the 4–3–3, the 4–2–3–1, the 4–4–2, and the 3–5–2, in order to find the system that best suited his players, and has been credited with using &quot;simple systems&quot;, &quot;so that his players have the freedom needed to prove their superiority.&quot; Zidane has been praised for his balanced approach as a coach, and for having the leadership skills and personability to manage and motivate several world class players, create a good team environment, foster professional relationships, and a strong winning mentality; he has also demonstrated an ability to rotate players and get the best out his team, which has played a key role in his success. In 2019, he commented, &quot;You ask me about two players but what interests me is the group. Karim is important for the team, not just for his goals. Casemiro gives a lot of balance, but not only that. Everyone contributes something to the team in their own way on the field&quot;. Regarding his coaching role at Real Madrid, Zidane commented in 2018: &quot;When you work with high-quality players, they know how to manage those periods of games when you’re not playing well, and they get things back on track very quickly. My job was to keep people calm!&quot; Two of his main influences as a manager are his own former managers Marcello Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti.

==In popular culture==
Zidane has had endorsements with many companies, including Adidas, Lego, France Telecom, Orange, Audi, Volvic and Christian Dior. These sponsorship deals earned him €8.6 million on top of his €6.4 million Real Madrid salary in 2006, totalling €15 million ($20.4 million), which made him the sixth-highest paid footballer. In 2004, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed his earnings of $15.8 million for the previous 12 months. In May 2010, Zidane appeared in a commercial for Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with Pelé and Diego Maradona. Zidane features as the cover star of the Ultimate Edition of the &quot;FIFA&quot; video game &quot;FIFA 20&quot;.

In 2005, filmmakers Philippe Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed a documentary &quot;&quot;, which follows Zidane during an entire match, filmed with 17 cameras. Scottish post-rock band Mogwai provided the soundtrack. The documentary was part of the 2009 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.

In November 2006, Zidane toured Bangladesh as the guest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. He also visited the Algerian birthplace of his parents and met with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who gave him an official reception. In 2012, French-Algerian artist Adel Abdessemed unveiled a bronze sculpture depicting Zidane&#x27;s headbutt of Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup Final.

On 5 November 2006, Zidane appeared in the American animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;, seen headbutting an old lady in the episode &quot;Saving Private Brian&quot; as a parody of his headbutt on Materazzi. The infamous headbutt has also been the subject of a lyrical essay by the Belgian novelist Jean-Philippe Toussaint entitled &quot;La Mélancolie de Zidane&quot; (2006).

In 2010, footage of Zidane appeared in the &quot;Waka Waka&quot; music video by Shakira, which shows him celebrating France winning the 1998 World Cup. In 2014, Australian sports presenter Les Murray collaborated with the band Vaudeville Smash and performed a Zidane tribute song, the accompanying video featuring four footballers performing ball tricks in Zidane masks, one of whom ends up headbutting a nightwatchman. In 2016, Zidane was ranked one of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre of Jordan, which noted: &quot;[Zidane&#x27;s] modest character has endeared him to the wider public.&quot;

==Personal life==
At the age of 17, Zidane met his future wife, Véronique Fernández (born in Aveyron of Spanish descent), while playing for Cannes in the 1988–89 season. Married in 1994, they have four sons: Enzo Zidane (born 24 March 1995), Luca Zidane (born 13 May 1998), Théo Zidane (born 18 May 2002), and Elyaz Zidane (born 26 December 2005).

On 12 July 2019, his elder brother Farid died of cancer at the age of 54.

<doc id="77882" wikidata="Q815249" url="?curid=77882" title="Jukebox">
<text>A jukebox is a partially automated music-playing device, usually a coin-operated machine, that plays a patron&#x27;s selection from self-contained media. The classic jukebox has buttons with letters and numbers on them, which are used to select specific records. Some may use compact discs instead. Disc changers are similar devices for home use; they are small enough to fit on a shelf and can hold up to hundreds of discs, allowing them to be easily removed, replaced, or inserted by the user.

==History==
Coin-operated music boxes and player pianos were the first forms of automated coin-operated musical devices. These devices used paper rolls, metal disks, or metal cylinders to play a musical selection on an actual instrument, or on several actual instruments, enclosed within the device.

In the 1890s, these devices were joined by machines which used recordings instead of actual physical instruments.

In 1889, Louis Glass and William S. Arnold invented the nickel-in-the-slot phonograph, in San Francisco. This was an Edison Class M Electric Phonograph retrofitted with a device patented under the name of &#x27;Coin Actuated Attachment for Phonograph&#x27;. The music was heard via one of four listening tubes.

In 1928, Justus P. Seeburg, who was manufacturing player pianos, combined an electrostatic loudspeaker with a record player that was coin-operated. This &#x27;Audiophone&#x27; machine was wide and bulky because it had eight separate turntables mounted on a rotating Ferris wheel-like device, allowing patrons to select from eight different 10&quot; 78rpm records. 

Also in 1928, Homer E. Capehart and some backers founded the Capehart Automatic Phonograph Company, which brought out the Orchestrope. It was a device in which the tone arm slipped between each record in a vertical stack, playing that record on which the needle fell.

A similar system to Seeburg&#x27;s Audiophone was employed by the Mills Novelty Company in their 1935 Dancemaster Automatic Phonograph. The Seeburg Symphonola &quot;Trashcan&quot; jukebox of 1938 holds 20 10&quot; 78rpm records each in a shallow centreless drawer so that when the selected record&#x27;s drawer opens, the turntable can rise through the open centre of the drawer to lift the record up to meet the pickup arm at the top of the mechanism, where it plays. Working examples of both these instruments may be seen and heard at the Musical Museum, Brentford, England.

Later versions of the jukebox included Seeburg&#x27;s &quot;Selectophone&quot; with 10 turntables mounted vertically on a spindle. By maneuvering the tone arm up and down, the customer could select from 10 different records.
The word &quot;jukebox&quot; came into use in the United States beginning in 1940, apparently derived from the familiar usage &quot;juke joint&quot;, derived from the Gullah word &quot;juke&quot;, which means &quot;bawdy&quot;. Manufacturers of jukeboxes tried to avoid using the term, associated with unreputable places, for many years.


Wallboxes were an important, and profitable, part of any jukebox installation. Serving as a remote control, they enabled patrons to select tunes from their table or booth. One example is the Seeburg 3W1, introduced in 1949 as companion to the 100-selection Model M100A jukebox. Stereo sound became popular in the early 1960s, and wallboxes of the era were designed with built-in speakers to provide patrons a sample of this latest technology.

Jukeboxes were most popular from the 1940s through the mid-1960s, particularly during the 1950s. By the middle of the 1940s, three-quarters of the records produced in America went into jukeboxes. &quot;Billboard&quot; published a record chart measuring jukebox play during the 1950s, which briefly became a component of the Hot 100; by 1959, the jukebox&#x27;s popularity had waned to the point where &quot;Billboard&quot; ceased publishing the chart and stopped collecting jukebox play data.

As of 2016, at least two companies still manufacture classically styled jukeboxes: Rockola, based in California, and Sound Leisure, based in Leeds in the UK. Both companies manufacture jukeboxes based on a CD playing mechanism. However, in April 2016, Sound Leisure showed a prototype of a &quot;Vinyl Rocket&quot; at the UK Classic Car Show. It stated that it would start production of the 140 7&quot; vinyl selector (70 records) in summer of the same year.

Since 2018, Orphéau, based in Brittany in France manufactures the original styled &quot;Sunflower&quot; Jukebox with the first 12&quot; vinyl record selector (20 records), on both sides.

==Notable models==
* 1927 LINK – Valued at US$40,000 and extremely rare
* 1940 Gabel Kuro – 78 rpm, the manufacturer&#x27;s last model. Four or five are known to exist; valued at US$125,000
* 1942 Rock-Ola President – Only one is known to exist; valued at least US$150,000
* 1942 Rock-Ola Premier – 15 known to exist; valued at US$20,000
* 1942 Wurlitzer 950 – 75–90 known to exist; valued at US$35,000
* 1946 Wurlitzer Model 1015 – Called the &quot;1015 bubbler&quot;, it offered 24 selections. More than 56,000 were sold in less than two years. Considered a pop culture icon, it was designed by Paul Fuller.
* 1952 Seeburg M100C – The jukebox exterior used in the credit sequences for &quot;Happy Days&quot; in seasons 1–10. It played up to fifty 45-RPM records, making it a 100-play. It was very colorful, with chrome glass tubes on the front, mirrors in the display, and rotating animation in the pilasters.
* 1967 Rock-Ola 434 Concerto – The jukebox interior used in the credit sequence for the 11th and final season of &quot;Happy Days&quot;. Like the Seeburg M100C, it played up to fifty 45-RPM records, but unlike the M100C, had a horizontal playback mechanism.
*2018 Orphéau Sunflower Serie – The first jukebox that played up to twenty 33-RPM records on both sides.

==Decline==
Traditional jukeboxes once were an important source of income for record publishers. Jukeboxes received the newest recordings first. They became an important market-testing device for new music, since they tallied the number of plays for each title. They let listeners control the music outside of their home, before audio technology became portable. They played music on demand without commercials. They also offered high fidelity listening before home high fidelity equipment became affordable.

In 1995, the United States Postal Service issued a 25-cent stamp commemorating the jukebox.

==Modern derivatives==
===Jukebox digital music players===

The term &quot;jukebox&quot; was used to describe high-capacity, hard disk based digital audio play due to their amount of digital space allowing a great number of music to be stored and played. The term was popularised following the introduction of the Creative NOMAD Jukebox in 2000, which could store as many as 150 CDs of music on its six gigabyte hard drive. In later years, the &quot;classic&quot; iPod would become the most popular product in this category.

===Digital jukebox and apps===
While the number of traditional jukeboxes declined, digital jukeboxes, also called &quot;social jukebox&quot;, have been introduced.

<text>Greensboro (; ) is a city in and the county seat of Guilford County, North Carolina, United States. At the 2020 census, its population was 299,035; it was estimated to be 302,296 in 2023. It is the third-most populous city in North Carolina, after Charlotte and Raleigh, and the 69th-most populous city in the United States. The population of the Greensboro–High Point metropolitan statistical area was estimated to be 789,842 in 2023. The Piedmont Triad region, of which Greensboro is the most populous city, had an estimated population of 1,736,099 in 2023.

In 1808, Greensboro was planned around a central courthouse square to succeed Guilford Court House as the county seat. The county courts were thus placed closer to the county&#x27;s geographical center, a location more easily reached at the time by the majority of the county&#x27;s citizens, who traveled by horse or on foot. Three major Interstate Highways (Interstate 40, Interstate 85, and Interstate 73) in the Piedmont region of central North Carolina were built to intersect at this city.

Among Greensboro&#x27;s many notable attractions, some of the most popular are the Greensboro Science Center, the International Civil Rights Museum, The Steven Tanger Center for the Performing Arts, the Weatherspoon Art Museum, the Greensboro Symphony, and the Greensboro Ballet. Annual events in the city include the North Carolina Folk Festival, First Fridays in Downtown Greensboro, Fun Fourth of July Festival, North Carolina Comedy Festival, and Winter Wonderlights. From 2015 to 2017, Greensboro hosted the National Folk Festival.

The Greensboro Coliseum Complex hosts a variety of major sporting events, concerts, and other events, including the ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament and women&#x27;s basketball tournament. Local professional teams include the Greensboro Grasshoppers of the South Atlantic Baseball League, the Greensboro Swarm of the NBA G League, and the semi-professional Carolina Dynamo soccer club of USL League Two. Amateur teams include Greensboro Roller Derby and college teams in four NCAA programs. The Sedgefield Country Club is currently host to the annual PGA Tour event Wyndham Golf Championship. Greensboro would serve as the Atlantic Coast Conference headquarters for 70 years, until the league relocated to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2023.

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the inhabitants of the area that became Greensboro were the Saura, a Siouan-speaking people. Other indigenous cultures had occupied this area for thousands of years, typically settling along the waterways, as did the early settlers.

Quaker migrants from Pennsylvania, by way of Maryland, arrived at Capefair (now Greensboro) in about 1750. The new settlers began organized religious services affiliated with the Cane Creek Friends Meeting in Snow Camp in 1751. Three years later, 40 Quaker families were granted approval to establish New Garden Monthly Meeting. The action is recorded in the minutes of the Perquimans and Little River Quarterly Meeting on May 25, 1754: &quot;To Friends at New Garden in Capefair&quot;, signed by Joseph Ratliff. The settlement grew rapidly over the next three years, adding members from as far away as Nantucket, Massachusetts. It soon became North Carolina&#x27;s most important Quaker community and the mother of several other Quaker meetings established in the state and west of the Appalachians.

After the Revolutionary War, the city of Greensboro was named for Major General Nathanael Greene, commander of the rebel American forces at the Battle of Guilford Court House on March 15, 1781. Although the Americans lost the battle, Greene&#x27;s forces inflicted heavy casualties on the British Army of General Cornwallis. After the battle, Cornwallis withdrew his troops to a British coastal base in Wilmington.
Greensboro was established near the geographic center of Guilford County, on land that was &quot;an unbroken forest with thick undergrowth of huckleberry bushes, that bore a finely flavored fruit.&quot; Property for the future village was purchased from the Saura for $98. Three north–south streets (Greene, Elm, Davie) were laid out intersecting with three east–west streets, Gaston, Market, and Sycamore. The courthouse was built at the center of the intersection of Elm and Market streets. By 1821, the town was home to 369 residents.
In the early 1840s, the state government designated Greensboro as one of the stops on a new railroad line, at the request of Governor John Motley Morehead, whose house, Blandwood, was in Greensboro. Stimulated by rail traffic and improved access to markets, the city grew substantially, soon becoming known as the &quot;Gate City&quot; due to its role as a transportation hub for the Piedmont. The railroads transported goods to and from the cotton textile mills. Many of the manufacturers developed workers&#x27; housing in mill villages near their facilities.

Though the city developed slowly, early wealth generated in the 18th and 19th centuries from cotton trade and merchandising resulted in owners&#x27; constructing several notable buildings. The earliest, later named Blandwood Mansion and Gardens, was built by a farmer in 1795. Additions to this residence in 1846, designed by Alexander Jackson Davis, made the house influential as America&#x27;s earliest Tuscan-style villa. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark. Other significant houses and estates were developed, including Dunleith, designed by Samuel Sloan; Bellemeade; and the Bumpass-Troy House. Since the late 20th century, the latter has been adapted and operates as a private inn.

===Civil War and last days of the Confederacy===
In the mid-19th century, many of the residents of the Piedmont and western areas of the state were Unionist, and Guilford County did not vote for secession. But once North Carolina joined the Confederacy, some citizens joined the Confederate cause, forming infantry units such as the Guilford Grays to fight in the American Civil War. From 1861 to March 1865 the city was relatively untouched by the war, although residents had to deal with regional shortages of clothing, medicine, and other items caused by the US naval blockade of the South.

In the war&#x27;s final weeks, Greensboro played a unique role in the last days of the Confederate government. In April 1865, the commanding officer of the Army of Tennessee, General Joseph E. Johnston, instructed General P. G. T. Beauregard to prepare to defend the city. During this time, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the remaining members of the Confederate cabinet had evacuated the Confederate Capital in Richmond, Virginia, and moved south to Danville, Virginia.

When Union cavalry threatened Danville, Davis and his cabinet managed to escape by train, and reassembled in Greensboro on April 11, 1865. While in the city, Davis and his cabinet decided to try to split up and make their way west of the Mississippi River to continue the war effort and avoid capture. Shortly thereafter, the cabinet left Greensboro and separated. Greensboro is notable as the last place where the entire Confederate government met as a group; some consider it the Confederacy&#x27;s final capital city.

At nearly the same time, Governor Zebulon B. Vance fled Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina, before the forces of Union General William Tecumseh Sherman swept the city. For a brief period beginning April 16, 1865, he and other officials maintained the state capital in Greensboro. Vance proclaimed the North Carolina Surrender Declaration on April 28, 1865. Later, he surrendered to Union officials in the parlor of Blandwood Mansion. Historian Blackwell Robinson wrote, &quot;Greensboro witnessed not only the demise of the Confederacy but also that of the old civil government of the state.&quot;

Once surrender negotiations were completed at Bennett Place (in present-day Durham) between General Johnston and General Sherman on April 26, 1865, Confederate soldiers in Greensboro stacked their arms, received their paroles, and headed home.

===Industrialization and growth===
After the war, investors worked to restore the textile mills and related industry. In the 1890s, the city continued to attract attention from northern industrialists, including Moses and Caesar Cone of Baltimore. The Cone brothers established large-scale textile plants, changing Greensboro from a village to a city within a decade. By 1900, Greensboro was considered a center of the Southern textile industry, with large-scale factories producing denim, flannel, and overalls. The resulting prosperity was expressed in the construction of notable 20th-century civic architecture, including the Guilford County Courthouse, West Market Street United Methodist Church by S. W. Faulk, several buildings designed by Frank A. Weston, and the Julius I. Foust Building of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, designed by Orlo Epps.

During the 20th century, Greensboro continued to increase in population and wealth. Grand commercial and civic buildings, many of which still stand today, were designed by local architects Charles Hartmann and Harry Barton. Other notable industries became established in the city, including Vicks Chemical Co. (known for over-the-counter cold remedies such as VapoRub and NyQuil), Carolina Steel Corporation, and Pomona Terra Cotta Works. During the first three decades, Greensboro grew so rapidly that there was an acute worker housing shortage. Builders set a construction goal of 80 to 100 affordable housing units per year to provide homes for workers. Greensboro&#x27;s real estate was considered &quot;the wonder of the state&quot; in the 1920s. Growth continued even through the Great Depression, as Greensboro attracted an estimated 200 new families per year. The city earned a reputation as a well-planned community with a strong emphasis on education, parks, and a profitable employment base.

Greensboro has two major public research universities, North Carolina A&amp;T State University, a historically black college established in the late 19th century, and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. During the height of the civil rights movement in the early 1960s, students from A&amp;T were the major force in protests to achieve racial justice, desegregation of public facilities, and fair employment, beginning with the Greensboro Four, who sat in at the segregated lunch counter at Woolworth&#x27;s in 1960 to gain service. The largest civil rights protests in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro in May and June 1963. In the 21st century, the universities are leaders in new areas of research in high tech and science, on which the city hopes to build a new economy.

Wartime and postwar prosperity brought development, and designs commissioned from nationally and internationally known architects. Walter Gropius, a leader of the German Bauhaus movement in the United States, designed a factory building in the city in 1944. Greensboro-based Ed Loewenstein designed projects throughout the region. Eduardo Catalano and George Matsumoto were hired for projects whose designs have challenged North Carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms.

===Civil rights movement===

In 1960, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Greensboro&#x27;s population as 74.0% white and 25.8% black. As in the rest of the state, most blacks were still disenfranchised under state laws, Jim Crow laws and customs were in effect, and public facilities, including schools, were racially segregated by law. This was after the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Facilities reserved for blacks were generally underfunded by the state and city governments, which were dominated by conservative white Democrats.

In the postwar period, blacks in North Carolina and across the South pushed to regain their constitutional rights. College students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College (A&amp;T), a historically black college, made Greensboro a center of protests and change. On February 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at an &quot;all-white&quot; Woolworth&#x27;s lunch counter, and refused to leave after they were denied service. They had already purchased items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts. After being denied lunch service, they brought out the receipts, asking why their money was good everywhere else in the store but not at the lunch counter. Hundreds of supporters soon joined in this sit-in, which lasted several months. Such protests quickly spread across the South, ultimately leading to the desegregation of lunch counters and other facilities at Woolworth&#x27;s and other chains.

Woolworth&#x27;s went out of business due to changes in 20th-century retail practices, but the original Woolworth&#x27;s lunch counter and stools are still in their original location. The former Woolworth&#x27;s building has been adapted as the International Civil Rights Center and Museum, which opened on February 1, 2010, the 50th anniversary of the sit-ins. A section of the counter is on display at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. to mark the protesters&#x27; courage.
The white business community acceded to the desegregation of Woolworth&#x27;s and made other minor concessions, but the civil rights movement had additional goals, holding protests in 1962 and 1963. In May and June 1963, the largest civil rights protest in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro. Protesters sought desegregation of public accommodations, and economic and social justice, such as hiring policies based on merit rather than race. They also worked for the overdue integration of public schools.

Each night more than 2,000 protesters marched through Greensboro&#x27;s segregated central business district. William Thomas and A. Knighton Stanley, coordinators of Greensboro&#x27;s local CORE chapter, invited Jesse Jackson, then an activist student at A&amp;T, to join the protests. Jackson quickly rose to prominence as a student leader, becoming the public spokesman of the non-violent protest movement. Seeking to overwhelm city jails, as was done in protests led by Martin Luther King Jr. in Birmingham, Alabama, the protesters invited arrest by violating segregation rules of local businesses; they were charged with trespassing and other nonviolent actions. College and high school students constituted most of the protesters, and at one point approximately 1,400 blacks were jailed in Greensboro. The scale of protests disrupted the business community and challenged the leadership of the mayor and Governor Terry Sanford.

Finally, the city and business community responded with further desegregation of public facilities, reformed hiring policies in city government, and commitments to progress by both Sanford and Greensboro&#x27;s mayor. Sanford declared, &quot;Anyone who hasn&#x27;t received this message doesn&#x27;t understand human nature.&quot; Significant changes in race relations still came at a painfully slow pace, and the verbal commitments from white leadership in 1963 were not implemented in substantial ways.

===Dudley High School/A&amp;T protests===

In May 1969, students of James B. Dudley High School were outraged when the administration refused to let a popular candidate, Claude Barnes, run for student union class president, allegedly due to his membership in Youth for the Unity of Black Society. After their appeals to the school were rejected, the students asked activists at North Carolina A&amp;T State University for support in a protest. Protests escalated and after students at A&amp;T had thrown rocks at police, they returned on May 21 armed with tear gas canisters, using them against the crowds. The uprising grew larger, and the governor ordered the National Guard to back up local police.

After there were exchanges of gunfire, the governor ordered the North Carolina National Guard into the A&amp;T campus, in what was described at the time as &quot;the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university&quot;. The North Carolina National Guard swept the college dormitories, taking hundreds of students into &quot;protective custody&quot;. The demonstrations were suppressed. The North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the United States Commission on Civil Rights investigated the disturbances; its 1970 report concluded that the National Guard invasion was a reckless action disproportionate to the danger posed by student protests. It criticized local community leaders for failing to respond adequately to the Dudley High School students when the issues first arose. They declared it &quot;a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the Dudley students seriously were the students at A&amp;T State University&quot;.

===Greensboro massacre===
On November 3, 1979, members of what would become the Communist Workers Party (CWP) held an anti-Ku Klux Klan rally at the Morningside Homes public housing project. Four local TV news stations covered it. During the protest, two cars containing Klansmen and neo-Nazis arrived. After a confrontation, the KKK and CWP groups exchanged gunfire. Five CWP members were killed. Eleven CWP members and one Klansman were injured. Television footage of the actions was shown worldwide, and the event became known as the Greensboro massacre. In November 1980, six KKK defendants were acquitted in a state criminal trial by an all-white jury after a week of deliberation. Families of those killed and injured in the attack filed a civil suit against the city and police department for failure to protect citizens. In 1985, a jury in this case found five police officers and two other individuals liable for $350,000 in damages; the monies were to be paid to the Greensboro Justice Fund, established to advance civil rights.

=== 21st century ===
Textile companies and related businesses continue into the 21st century, when most went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies as textile manufacturing jobs moved offshore. Greensboro is still a major center of the textile industry, with the main offices of Elevate Textiles (Cone, Burlington Industries), Galey &amp; Lord, Unifi, and VF Corporation (Wrangler, Lee, The North Face, and Nautica). ITG Brands, maker of Kool, Winston and Salem brand cigarettes and the nation&#x27;s third-largest tobacco company is headquartered in Greensboro. 

Rail traffic continues to be important for the city&#x27;s economy, as Greensboro is a major regional freight hub. Twelve Amtrak passenger trains also stop in Greensboro daily. The Crescent has its platform on the main Norfolk Southern line between Washington and New Orleans by way of Atlanta. The Carolinian and Piedmont trains have their platform at the start of Norfolk Southern NC-Line that runs from Greensboro to Goldsboro, NC. The Norfolk Southern K-Line starts at the Pomona freight yard just west of downtown and runs towards Winston-Salem. The Norfolk Southern CF-Line originally started in Mt. Airy, NC but rail has been removed north of downtown and now starts at the wye with the mainline downtown and heads south to Gulf, NC

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, Greensboro has an area of , of which is land and (3.83%) is water.

The city of Greensboro lies among the rolling hills of North Carolina&#x27;s Piedmont, midway between the state&#x27;s Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains to the west and the Atlantic beaches and Outer Banks to the east. The view of Greensboro from its highest building—the Lincoln Financial tower, commonly known as the Jefferson-Pilot Building after its previous owner,—shows an expanse of shade trees in the city. 

Interstates 40, 73, and 85 intersect at Greensboro. Greensboro is east of Winston-Salem, west of Durham, northwest of Raleigh, northeast of Charlotte, and southwest of Richmond, Virginia.

===Neighborhoods and districts===
====Downtown====
Downtown Greensboro has attracted development investment in recent years with such new construction as First National Bank Field, residential construction, and offices. The Southside neighborhood downtown exemplifies central-city reinvestment. The formerly economically depressed neighborhood has been redeveloped as an award-winning neotraditional-style neighborhood featuring walkability, compact blocks and local amenities and services.

The redevelopment of the downtown was stimulated by the 2006 opening of the Elon University School of Law. The law school is credited with attracting student dollars to the downtown.

====Four Seasons/Coliseum area==== 
The Four Seasons Town Centre, at 410 Four Seasons Town Centre, is a three-story shopping mall with of shopping space developed by the Koury Corporation. It is adjacent to the Joseph S. Koury Convention Center and Sheraton Hotel. With over of flexible meeting space, the Koury Convention Center is the largest convention center in the Southeast between Atlanta and Washington, D.C. The hotel has more than 1,000 rooms.

The Greensboro Coliseum is at 1921 W. Gate City Boulevard. This multipurpose complex consists of the 22,000-seat Greensboro Coliseum, the 300-seat Odeon Theatre, and the Special Events Center, which includes three exhibition halls, a 4,500-seat mini-arena, and eight meeting rooms. The Pavilion is adjacent. The complex hosts &quot;a broad range of activities, including athletic events, cultural arts, concerts, theater, educational activities, fairs, exhibits, and public and private events of all kinds including conventions, convocations and trade and consumer shows&quot;. The Greensboro Aquatic Center, which hosts national swimming and diving events, is also in this complex.

====Triad Airport area====
In 1998, FedEx built a $300 million mid-Atlantic air-cargo and sorting hub at Piedmont Triad International Airport, after an intensive competition for the hub among other regions of the state, as well as locations in South Carolina. The project was challenged in court based on the quality of planned noise and pollution abatements from neighborhoods near the site. The hub opened in 2009. Originally projected by FedEx to employ 750 people in its first two years of operation and eventually 1,500, local FedEx employment has been nearly the same as before the facility was constructed.

In March 2015, HondaJet, with a manufacturing facility in Greensboro, announced that it had received provisional type certification (PTC) from the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This achievement indicates the FAA&#x27;s approval of the HondaJet design based on certification testing, design reviews, and analyses completed to date.

In 2022, construction began on the Boom Supersonic factory at the airport and it was completed in June 2024. The site will be used as a final assembly line and test site for its supersonic passenger aircraft, Overture. 

===Climate===
Like much of the southeastern United States, Greensboro has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with four distinct seasons. Winters are short and generally cool, with a January daily average of . On average, there are 75 nights per year that drop to or below freezing, and 4.3 days that fail to rise above freezing. Measurable snowfall occurs nearly every winter, and accumulates to on average, usually in January and February and occasionally December and March; the amount varies considerably from winter to winter. Cold-air damming (CAD) can facilitate freezing rain, often making it a more pressing concern than snow. Summers are hot and humid, with a daily average in July of . On average, 32 days per year have highs at or above , but, as in much of the Piedmont South, + readings are uncommon. Autumn is similar to spring in temperature but has fewer days of rainfall and less total rainfall. Extremes in temperature have ranged from on January 21, 1985, to , on June 12, 1911, June 12, 1914, and July 17, 1914.

Thunderstorms are common during the humid spring and summer months, some severe. On April 2, 1936, around 7:00 pm, a large, F-4 tornado cut a seven-mile (11-km) swath of destruction through southern Greensboro. 14 people were killed and 144 injured by the tornado, which moved through part of downtown. The storm was part of the 1936 Cordele-Greensboro tornado outbreak. Strong tornadoes have struck the Greensboro area since then, notably Stoneville on March 20, 1998; Clemmons and Winston-Salem on May 5, 1989; Clemmons and Greensboro on May 7, 2008; High Point on March 28, 2010; and Greensboro on April 15, 2018.

<doc id="77886" wikidata="Q3405891" url="?curid=77886" title="Modern Western square dance">
<text>Modern western square dance (also called western square dance, contemporary western square dance, modern American square dance or modern square dance) is one of two American types of square dancing, along with traditional square dance. As a dance form, modern western square dance grew out of traditional square dance in the American West. The term &quot;western square dance&quot;, for some, is synonymous with &quot;cowboy dance&quot; or traditional western square dance. Therefore, this article uses the term &quot;modern western square dance&quot; to describe the contemporary non-historical dance which grew out of the traditional dance. Square dancing was the national folk dance of the United States in 1982 and 1983.

Modern western square dance, like traditional square dance, is directed by a &quot;caller&quot;. In modern western square dance the caller strings together a sequence of individual &quot;square dance calls&quot; to make a figure or sequence. These calls are the building blocks of the choreography that is danced by the individuals – square dancers – in the squares. There are eight people (four pairs of males and females, traditionally) in each square; at a dance there may be many squares. Generally speaking, each of these squares dances independently of each other, with the exception of specialty or &quot;gimmick&quot; dances, where there might be some crossover of dancers from one square to another.

While traditional square dance uses live music, modern western square dancing is usually played from recordings. This allows more variety in music styles than in traditional square dance. The tempo is also more uniform than in traditional dancing, as the ideal modern western square dance tempo is 120–128 bpm. At this speed dancers take one step per beat of the music.

The square functions as a &quot;dance team&quot; for the duration of a &quot;square dance tip&quot;, a group of dances usually separated from the next tip by a pause during which the dancers regroup into new squares. A square dance tip is usually composed of a combination of &quot;patter calls&quot; and &quot;singing calls&quot;, the two types of square dance calls.

Modern western square dancing is a non-competitive activity. There are no dance competitions, and apart from fun events, no prizes are ever offered or sought for &#x27;best dancer&#x27; or &#x27;best square&#x27;. Particularly at the &#x27;challenge&#x27; levels there is large degree of personal satisfaction to be gained from the problem solving element of completing a dance. At all levels the main elements are to enjoy the dance, and to exercise.

Modern western square dancing is found in many countries across the world. The main centers are where United States military servicemen spread the dance during the 1950s through 1980s. Modern square dancing is found in such diverse counties as Japan, Denmark, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, Spain, Germany and Australia. The Callerlab organization has standardized dance calls, allowing dancers to dance anywhere in the world.

== Learning modern western square dance ==

Dancers learn the individual calls at sponsored square dance clubs classes, taught by square dance callers. Clubs also sponsor special social and dance evenings, as well as open square dances.

The individual calls are categorized as belonging to a particular dance program, or level of difficulty. Each dance program has a list of defined dance steps, which is associated with it. These lists of dance steps are managed, and universally recognized.

Callerlab, the International Association of Square Dance Callers, the largest international square dance association, manages the most universally accepted and recognized lists. There are four main levels, some of which are divided into sublevels: Mainstream, Plus, Advanced (2 sublevels), and Challenge (5 sublevels, the top two levels of which are not managed). In general, the first three levels are more physically active than the challenge level (often referred to as challenge square dance). Challenge square dance is more cerebral, and focuses on problem solving.

At the basic square dance levels, the dancer is introduced to many square dance calls. A few of the most fundamental and well-known calls are &quot;do-si-do&quot;, &quot;promenade&quot;, and &quot;right and left grand&quot;. Among other things, the dancer is additionally trained to move smoothly and rhythmically, to appreciate timing, to execute the steps from many different positions and in many different formations, and to cooperate effectively with the others in their square so that they get the most out of their dance experience.

Starting at the advanced level, the square dancer is introduced to square dance concepts, an addition to a call which modifies it in some way. Concepts often generalize more basic notions of square dancing and are an important aspect of challenge square dance.

== Dancing modern western square dance ==
Each dance round, called a &quot;tip&quot;, typically consists of two dances. The first dance part is known as a hash call, which is characterized by its unstructured and often puzzling dance choreography. The music is usually instrumental and the calls are typically not sung, but rather rhythmically spoken. The second dance part of a square dance tip is a singing call. The dance instructions are sung as well as the lyrics during the long duration calls. The music are often popular songs and the calls are timed to fit. During a singing call the female dancers temporarily switch partners in a counter-clockwise order around the square until they return to their original partners. The caller restores the original order of the square both at the end of the hash and the singing call. The duration time of a tip may vary, but is usually between ten and twenty minutes. Between tips, dancers are generally encouraged to find other dance partners and form new squares for the next tip.

==Dress code==
Modern western square dance has developed a &quot;look&quot; that has become known as &quot;square dance attire&quot;. This style of dress developed when square dancing&#x27;s popularity in the United States increased after World War II, and began soaring during the 1950s and early 1960s. Several factors may have helped influence the look that has become known as &quot;square dance attire&quot;. These include the visibility and popularity of square dance performers such as Lloyd &quot;Pappy&quot; Shaw‘s traveling troupe of &quot;teenage cowboy square dancers&quot;; the way square dancing and the west were portrayed in western movies and early television; and the popular clothing styles of those times, for example poodle skirts.
At the non-challenge levels, particularly in North America, of modern western square dancing participants are often expected to wear western-style square dance outfits, or &quot;square dance attire&quot;, especially at large dances. Over the years, there has been much discussion within square dancing circles about relaxing the dress code, and this has led to the adoption of alternative less restrictive attire designations— &quot;proper&quot; attire and &quot;casual&quot; attire. Clubs that sponsor dances are free to select a less restrictive dress code and are encouraged to advertise the dress code that is appropriate for their dance. Some clubs drop the &quot;traditional&quot; dress code requirement for classes and for their summer dances, and some, like challenge groups, gay square dance clubs and youth square dance clubs, have never had a dress code. Dress code is more relaxed in the UK than in North America, and to some extent than in Northern Europe.

Square dance attire for men includes long-sleeved western and western-style shirts, dress slacks, scarf or string ties (bolos) or kerchiefs, metal tips on shirt collars and boot tips, and sometimes cowboy hats and boots. It is very unusual to see hats and cowboy boots at dances in the UK.

Traditional square dance attire for women include gingham or polka-spotted dresses with wide skirts or a wide gingham or patterned skirt in a strong dark color with a white puff-sleeve blouse. Often dancers wear specially-made square dance outfits, with multiple layers of crinolines, petticoats, or pettipants.

Partners might have color- and pattern-coordinated outfits.

Both sexes might wear boots, but women most commonly wear soft-soled slippers or shoes with a single strap and low heel.

== Flourishes, sound effects, and games ==
There are many additions to or variations from standard square dancing, which have gained headway over the years. These are not universally recognized, and they are not all equally accepted or considered acceptable under all circumstances, or in all areas. Some of these are of local nature, and others are more widely known.

These variations fall into the following basic categories:

=== Flourishes ===
Flourishes are movements either in addition to or replacing the standard movement as defined. There are certain accepted flourishes in most communities, which may be limited to a club or geographic region, or be common among members of a group such as youth square dancers or gay square dancers. Common flourishes include replacing the dosado with a &quot;highland fling&quot; move, or twirling at the end of a promenade. Flourishes which are very common in a geographic area may be known informally as &quot;regional styling differences&quot;. Flourishes are usually omitted with those just learning to dance, as they may obscure the standard movement. Occasionally flourishes provide an opportunity for dancers to interact with adjacent squares.

There is a lot of controversy about flourishes, including from some square dance leaders who feel that flourishes divert dancers from dancing according to the standard. Dancers may object to flourishes due to being unfamiliar, physically challenging, or inappropriate for the music. At higher dance levels, differences in body flow due to a flourish can interfere with proper execution of a call. For any of these reasons, dancers may ask that flourishes be limited while they are dancing.

=== Sound effects ===
Sound effects are standard responses to the caller. These include vocalized sounds, hand claps and foot stomps. Sound effects are generally well accepted, as they do not change either the timing or the execution of the step. The sound effects often serve as a mnemonic device, in that dancers associate the execution of the step with the particular sounds. A rhyming or punning word-play on the name of the call is common. For example, the response &quot;Pink Lemonade&quot; mirrors rhythmically and rhymes with the call &quot;Triple Trade&quot;.

Problems with sound effects can occur when they make it difficult to hear the caller&#x27;s cues, or are shouted too loud; however, in practice such situations are rare.

=== Games ===
Games refer to rule bending games that increase the difficulty of a dance. These include dancing with fewer than 8 people in the square, changing partners in the middle of a tip, and changing squares in the middle of a tip. Playing games without the permission of the entire square (and often the caller) can be considered extremely rude, and may confuse other squares as well. Games can, however, be an excellent tool for improving square dance skills, especially in class or club situations, and often have the function of allowing dancers who otherwise cannot form a complete square to participate in a dance. At the advanced and challenge levels, games include dancing phantom (missing one or more dancers), in a hexagon (6 couples in a square, consisting of three head couples and three side couples) or bigons (4 people, each of whom dances their own part and that of their opposite).

== History of modern western square dance ==
=== Traditional western square dance ===
Square dance originates from country dances practiced in Great Britain and Ireland dating as far back as the 17th century. Several of the dances included in the 1651 book The Dancing Master by John Playford are square dances. These dance styles were brought to the United States by European colonists in the 19th century. The distinctive call format of square dance was invented by black slaves, and when combined with European styles, evolved into traditional square dance, most popular in New England and the Appalachians. When people from these regions began settling the West, these evolved into the cowboy dance, a direct predecessor to modern western square dance.

=== Preserving the heritage ===
By the early twentieth century, square dance was declining in popularity, lacking a new generation of young dancers to continue the practice. Lloyd Pappy Shaw, wishing to preserve square dance, traveled the country to record the calls used at the time, and compiled the steps in his book &quot;Cowboy Dances&quot;.

Another heavy promoter of square dance was the industrialist Henry Ford. Ford believed that Jews invented jazz as a plot to corrupt society. Ford believed that this plot could be counteracted by returning America to dances and musical styles that he saw as traditional and white. As a result, he used his wealth to promote square dancing, through books and square dancing events. Ford also promoted square dance classes in public school, which were present in half of all American schools in 1928 as part of the standard physical education curriculum.

Modern western square dance evolved in square dance events funded by Ford, using direction and guidance prepared by Shaw.

=== The square dance boom ===
During the height of the square dance craze, there were multiple efforts to designate it as the national dance of the United States. Square dance proponents successfully designated square dance as the official dance of 28 states. The effort to designate it as a national dance began in 1965, with more than 30 bills introduced in Congress. This succeeded in 1982, when it was a bill passed by Congress and the Senate designated it a national dance from 1982 until it expired in 1983. This was criticized as preferring square dance over numerous other American styles of dance, as well as square dancing having no relevance to urban and minority populations in the United States.

Modern western square dance was brought to many countries through Square Dance clubs on American forces bases, where local community involvement often began to occur. This was particularly common in Britain where this legacy is seen with square dance clubs such as Alconbury Anglo-American SDC, originally based at RAF Alconbury, and Heyford Hoofers, originally at RAF Upper Heyford. The club based on the USA base in Tehran -The Tehran Twirlers - relocated briefly to RAF Alconbury following the 1979 Revolution in Iran.

=== Square dance&#x27;s maturity ===
Since the 1960s, popularity of square dance has declined, as the square dance audience got older without young dancers to replace them. Square dance has also been gradually removed from public school curriculums.

In the 1970s, the Callerlab organization was established that standardized dance calls.

The 1970s and 1980s also found new audiences for square dance, most notably gay square dance and youth square dance. Since

Square Dancing in the UK has seen diminishing numbers of dancers since the 1990s as the activity has failed to attract sufficient numbers of younger dancers. There is a great deal of debate as to how to arrest this decline, or even if the decline should be addressed and accepted as inevitable. British dancers tend to be older people - this is in contrast to countries such as Denmark and Germany where there are flourishing numbers of teenage, student, and family dancers.

<doc id="77887" wikidata="Q210500" url="?curid=77887" title="Ion Television">
<text>Ion Television (referred to on-air as simply Ion) is an American broadcast television network and FAST television channel owned by the Scripps Networks subsidiary of the E. W. Scripps Company. The network first began broadcasting on August 31, 1998, as Pax TV, focusing primarily on family-oriented entertainment programming. It rebranded as i: Independent Television (commonly referred to as &quot;i&quot;) on July 1, 2005, converting into a general entertainment network featuring recent and older acquired programs. The network adopted its identity as Ion Television on January 29, 2007. 

For many years, Ion has focused primarily on off-network reruns of existing series, with most of its current schedule devoted to marathon blocks of procedural dramas, along with occasional broadcasts of films (including television films during the Christmas season). In the past, Ion had acquired first-run airings of Canadian series not picked up by other American networks and had also been infamous for devoting much of its schedule to infomercials. Under Scripps ownership, Ion has increasingly added national sports programming from the newly established Scripps Sports division, beginning with packages of WNBA basketball and NWSL soccer.

Ion is available throughout most of the United States through its group of 44 owned-and-operated stations and 20 network affiliates, as well as through distribution on pay-TV providers and streaming services; since 2014, the network has also increased affiliate distribution in several markets through the digital subchannels of local television stations owned by companies such as Gray Television and Nexstar Media Group where the network is unable to maintain a main channel affiliation with or own a standalone station, for the same purpose as the distribution of Ion&#x27;s main network feed via pay-TV providers and streaming services.

The network&#x27;s stations cover all of the top 20 U.S. markets and 37 of the top 50 markets. Ion&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations cover 64.8% of the United States population, by far the most of any U.S. station ownership group; it is able to circumvent the legal limit of covering 39% of the population because all of its stations operate on the UHF television band, which is subject to a discount in regard to that limit. In the digital age, the restoration of the UHF discount has proven controversial with other broadcast groups and FCC rulings between presidential administrations, though as the network&#x27;s parent company mainly acquired low-performing stations and stations on the fringes of markets which targeted lower-profile cities in the analog age, it has not been an issue with Ion Media itself.

==History==
===PAX (1998–2005)===

The network was launched by Bud Paxson, co-founder of the Home Shopping Network and chairman of parent company Paxson Communications (the forerunner to Ion Media). It was originally to be called &quot;Pax Net&quot;, but was renamed Pax TV (often referred to as simply &quot;Pax&quot;; stylized as &quot;PAX&quot;) – a dual reference to its founder and corporate parent, and the Latin word for &quot;&quot; – shortly before its launch. Paxson, who felt that television programs aired by other broadcast networks were too raunchy and not family-friendly enough, had decided to create a network that he perceived as an alternative. Since the new network would focus on programming tailored to family audiences, PAX maintained a considerably more conservative programming content policy than the major commercial television networks, restricting profanity, violence and sexual content; accordingly, many of the network&#x27;s acquired programs were edited to remove sexual and overt violent content, while profane language was muted. According to various news reports, Pax was eventually recognized as the seventh national TV network after The WB &amp; UPN (both collectively recognized as the fifth major TV network after Fox, with The WB being the fifth, &amp; UPN the sixth, national TV networks, respectively), though Pax never gained major TV network status during its existence.

Most of the network&#x27;s initial affiliates were Paxson Communications-owned affiliate stations of the Infomall TV Network (inTV), a network launched by Paxson in 1995 that relied mainly on infomercials and other brokered programming. During the late spring and summer of 1998, a half-hour preview special hosted by former &quot;Waltons&quot; star Richard Thomas, featuring interviews with Lowell Paxson about PAX&#x27;s development and initial programming, aired on inTV stations slated to become charter outlets of the new network.

PAX launched on August 31, 1998, with the network&#x27;s initial schedule being much larger in scope than it would be in later years. At launch, Pax aired general entertainment programming on weekdays from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and weekends from 3:00 p.m. to 10:00 pm. Central Time. Through an agreement with then-Disney owned animation studio DIC Productions L.P., its schedule also included a children&#x27;s program block called &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; on Saturdays from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and Sundays from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 am. Central. In addition, the network aired religious programming through time-lease agreements with The Worship Network (which aired its overnight programming on PAX seven nights a week) and Praise TV (featuring Contemporary Christian music and other faith-based programs aimed at teenagers and young adults, which aired on Friday and Saturday late-nights from 11:00 p.m. to 2:00 am. Central until 2000). The remainder of the schedule was filled by paid programming.

Initial programming on PAX consisted of first-run shows (such as the true story profile series &quot;It&#x27;s a Miracle&quot;, game show &quot;The Reel to Reel Picture Show&quot;, and talk shows &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Great Day America&quot;), along with reruns of older programming (including &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;, &quot;Dave&#x27;s World&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, and new episodes and older reruns of &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, the latter of which moved to the network following the revival series&#x27; cancellation by CBS earlier in 1998). The network also produced some original drama series such as &quot;Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye&quot;, &quot;Doc&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; (which originated on NBC), &quot;Hope Island&quot; and &quot;Twice in a Lifetime&quot; through its programming division, Paxson Entertainment. PAX also aired many game shows including first-run revivals of established games that originated on cable networks such as &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; and &quot;Shop &#x27;til You Drop&quot;, along with some original game shows such as &quot;On the Cover&quot;, &quot;Balderdash&quot;, &quot;Dirty Rotten Cheater&quot;, a 2002 revival of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Showdown&quot; (in conjunction with Game Show Network, which also aired the show) and reruns of &quot;Born Lucky&quot;. The network would later carry reruns of the syndicated revival of &quot;Family Feud&quot; (consisting of episodes from Louie Anderson, Richard Karn and John O&#x27;Hurley&#x27;s tenures as host, airing on a one-year delay from their original syndication broadcast) and, due to its alliance with NBC, &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; (both from the Anne Robinson-hosted network run and the George Gray-hosted syndicated version) as well as the 2000 revival of &quot;Twenty-One&quot;.

In September 1999, NBC purchased a 32% share of Paxson Communications for $415 million in convertible stock, with an option to expand its interest to 49% by February 2002, pending changes in ownership regulations set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that would allow it to acquire additional television stations. NBC later sold its share in the network back to Paxson in November 2003.

In lieu of a national news program, in 2000, Paxson Communications signed an agreement with Jackson, Mississippi-based WeatherVision – which mainly produces weather forecast inserts for television stations in certain markets that do not operate an in-house news department or maintain a news share agreement with another local station – to produce &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Weather Tonight&quot;, a five-minute national forecast segment that aired Monday through Friday nights at the conclusion of PAX&#x27;s entertainment schedule. Starting in 2000, many PAX stations also entered into news share agreements with a local major network affiliate (mostly involving NBC-affiliated stations, though some involved an affiliate of ABC, CBS, or Fox) to air tape-delayed broadcasts of evening, and in some markets, morning newscasts from the partner station; in a few cases, the agreement partner produced live newscasts for the PAX station (as examples of the latter, NBC affiliate WTHR in Indianapolis produced a prime time newscast for PAX O&amp;O WIPX-TV from February to June 2005, after CBS affiliate WISH-TV (now a CW affiliate) took over production of the newscast that WTHR had been producing for UPN affiliate WNDY-TV (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) since 1996; Cleveland NBC affiliate WKYC-TV produced evening newscasts for WVPX-TV that focused primarily on that O&amp;O&#x27;s city of license, nearby Akron). In some cities, a major network affiliate also provided some engineering and other back office services for the PAX station.

In an effort to increase revenue due to low viewership and other financial issues, PAX gradually increased the amount of paid programming content on its schedule throughout the early 2000s, at the expense of its general entertainment programming. Infomercials and other types of brokered programs ultimately became the dominant form of programming during the network&#x27;s broadcast day; by January 2005, the time that PAX had allocated to entertainment programs had been reduced to six hours on weekdays (from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 pm) and five hours on weekends (from 5:00 p.m. to 10:00 pm. Central Time). Original programming was also affected by the network&#x27;s programming changes; PAX was originally offering five or six new series each season. However, in 2003, the number of new series that aired on PAX dwindled to just two: &quot;Sue Thomas: F.B.Eye&quot;, which was cancelled in 2005, and &quot;Doc&quot;, which was cancelled in 2004 after PAX&#x27;s international backer, Canadian broadcast network CTV, pulled out of producing the shows. The network seemingly recovered a year later when seven series made it to PAX&#x27;s 2004–05 schedule.

===&quot;i&quot; (2005–2007)===
On June 28, 2005, Paxson Communications announced that it would rebrand PAX as i: Independent Television, to reflect a new strategy of &quot;providing an independent broadcast platform for producers and syndicators who desire to reach a national audience.&quot; The network used a lowercase letter &quot;i&quot; for its branding and other items such as its electronic program guide listings.

The rebranding also resulted in several changes to its programming lineup: paid programming replaced overnight programming from The Worship Network, which began to carry its full 24-hour schedule on a fourth digital subchannel of local &quot;i&quot; owned-and-operated stations and affiliates until the network was dropped in January 2010; in addition, &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Weather Tonight&quot; and rebroadcasts of network affiliate newscasts were discontinued the day prior to the rebrand on June 30, 2005 (though a few stations not owned by the network&#x27;s parent company retained news share agreements with major network stations after that date, such as WBNA in Louisville, Kentucky, which continued to air newscasts from NBC affiliate WAVE). The network shifted its format almost entirely to reruns of television series from the 1960s to the 1990s (such as &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;Amen&quot;, and Pax holdover &quot;&quot;) and feature films, reruns of former Pax TV series (such as &quot;Doc&quot;) and first-run episodes (and later reruns) of Pax holdover series &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Kids&quot; were also included as part of the schedule. In turn, the network adapted its programming content standards to those similar to other broadcast networks. During the 2005–06 season, the network launched only one new series that met the network&#x27;s new mission of being an &#x27;independent broadcast platform&#x27;, the teen drama &quot;Palmetto Pointe&quot;, which only lasted five episodes and was criticized as a poor imitation of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;; the network went entirely to a lineup of reruns with limited original programming for the 2006–07 season (except for &quot;Health Report&quot; and specials branded under the name iHealth).

At one point in this era, the network programmed eighteen hours of paid programming per day, ¾ of the network&#x27;s broadcast day, with the network only programming the early fringe and prime time periods with traditional programming.

In November 2005, NBCUniversal was granted a transferable option to purchase a controlling stake in Paxson Communications. Had this option been exercised, NBC would have acquired approximately 63 &quot;i&quot; owned-and-operated stations (though this could have resulted in a forced divestiture of either &quot;i&quot; or Spanish network Telemundo, which NBC had acquired in April 2002 (prior to its merger with Vivendi Universal), along with the divested network&#x27;s O&amp;Os due to FCC rules that prohibit broadcasters from owning more than two television stations in the same market unless there are either a minimum of 20 full-power stations in the market or one of the stations is a satellite). As part of the agreement, Lowell Paxson stepped down from his position as chairman of Paxson Communications. In April 2006, published reports surfaced that &quot;i&quot; owed more than US$250 million to creditors. Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s reported a much higher debt in March 2008, owing $867 million to creditors and having a bond rating of CCC+/Outlook Negative.

According to a statement on its website, DirecTV (which ironically had, and still has, multiple networks made up of full-time paid programming) planned to terminate its carriage agreement with &quot;i&quot; on February 28, 2006. The satellite provider cited that &quot;most of [&quot;i&quot; Network&#x27;s] programming consists of infomercials and other promotional shows&quot;, despite an earlier promise by network executives that it &quot;would consist of general, family-oriented entertainment&quot;. At its peak, infomercial time stretched across eighteen hours of the network&#x27;s broadcast day, or 126 hours of a 168-hour broadcast week. To appease DirecTV management, the network launched a secondary feed of the network for providers adverse to its over-the-air programming direction, replacing paid programming time with older public domain programs and cancelled Pax TV original series. DirecTV and Paxson then reached a new carriage agreement in May 2006.

In September 2006, i launched Qubo, a children&#x27;s programming block, as part of a partnership with NBCUniversal and Scholastic Entertainment.

===Ion Television (2007–present)===

On January 29, 2007, the network changed its name again to Ion Television (as a result of its parent company&#x27;s renaming to Ion Media Networks). Days after the rebrand, California-based entertainment group Positive Ions, Inc. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Ion Media Networks, claiming that the network stole the &quot;Ion&quot; branding. Positive Ions had registered trademarks on the word &quot;Ion&quot; and had used the mark commercially since 1999. On May 14, 2007, Positive Ions filed for an injunction that, if granted, would have required Ion Media Networks to change its name once again. On May 4, 2007, Ion, Citadel Investment Group, and NBC Universal announced a deal to transfer NBC Universal&#x27;s rights to purchase a controlling stake in Ion to Citadel, in exchange for Citadel investing $100 million into Ion&#x27;s growth and digital plans.

Ion Television&#x27;s programming, for the most part, remained unchanged upon the rebrand; the network continued to feature programming from the content deals it signed while under the &quot;i&quot; brand (such as &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, and &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;). The network also aired a late afternoon sitcom block called &quot;Laugh Attack&quot;, which featured reruns of comedy series targeted at African American audiences (originally consisting of &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; and &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;, the latter of which was later replaced by &quot;The Steve Harvey Show&quot;).

In January 2008, Ion Media and Comcast reached a carriage agreement to continue carrying Ion Television, while also adding Qubo and Ion Life to the cable provider&#x27;s channel lineups.

Eventually, Ion Television would come to be known as the seventh national TV network, behind UPN, The WB, Fox, ABC, CBS, &amp; NBC, though it still wouldn&#x27;t achieve major network status.

====2008 relaunch====
On May 1, 2008, Ion Television held an upfront presentation announcing its programming for the 2008–09 season at the New York Public Library in Manhattan. In addition to the announcement of its programming acquisitions, the network unveiled a new logo (a wordmark that incorporated a positive ion symbol as a pseudo-period next to the &quot;ion&quot; typeface) and slogan for the network, &quot;Positively Entertaining&quot; (a form of wordplay, as ions are atoms or molecules that have a positive or negative electrical charge).

With the September 8, 2008, rebrand, the network also retooled its focus, emphasizing the key demographic of adults between ages of 18 and 49, and airing more recent acquired programming aimed at young adults (such as &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;NCIS&quot;, and &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;).

By this point, the network shifted its programming to feature extended blocks of its acquired series (which consist mostly of drama series, with sitcoms becoming an increasingly less integral part of the schedule); it also began a gradual expansion of the number of hours devoted to entertainment shows, starting with the addition of a two-hour block of programming in the late afternoon (from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 pm. Central) in January 2008, and expanding further into the daytime and late fringe/early graveyard periods over a five-year span (however, this resulted in the network increasing its reliance on regularly scheduled marathon-style blocks of a relatively small inventory of programs in lieu of acquiring a much larger lineup of series to fill out the schedule). More recent theatrically released feature films were also added to the lineup, alongside older movie releases from the 1980s and 1990s.

In April 2009, it was announced that Ion Media Networks was once again facing balance sheet problems. The company disclosed that it was in discussions with lenders on &quot;a comprehensive recapitalization&quot; of its balance sheet, translating to an effort to restructure its considerable debt, which, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, stood at $2.7 billion as of April 2009.

The network launched high definition operations in the 720p format, announcing they would do so on January 28, 2009, with an original launch date of February 16, 2009, but delayed to March 16, 2009, after the passage of the DTV Delay Act, which pushed the national digital television transition to June 12, 2009. Most Ion stations began to switch their main signals from 480i standard definition to 720p HD in late February; an early decision to pillarbox 4:3 programming with blue rather than black pillarboxing was eventually abandoned as black coloring became the industry norm. Some Ion-owned and affiliate stations which carry the network as a multicast offering continue to carry the network in 480i widescreen over-the-air.

On May 19, 2009, Ion Media Networks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, putting the Ion network under bankruptcy for the second time in its history; it had reached an agreement with holders of 60% of its first lien secured debt that would extinguish the entirety of its $2.7 billion legacy debt and preferred stock, and recapitalize the company with a $150 million new funding commitment. On July 15, 2009, RHI Entertainment entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a dispute with Ion Media Networks, which resulted in the termination of a programming distribution agreement between RHI and Ion.

Also, in 2009, Ion Television would come to be the sixth national TV network, this time, behind The CW, Fox, ABC, CBS, &amp; NBC, with MyNetworkTV in 2009 transitioning to a broadcast syndication service. However, Ion Television would never come to achieve major network status.

In November 2010, Ion Television began airing its first made-for-TV movies, in the form of Christmas-themed films that air between the weekend after Thanksgiving (airing the weekend before that holiday in 2013) and Christmas Day, with up to five films premiering each year on the network, although they are advertised as &quot;original movies&quot; in on-air promotions (the 2012 film &quot;Anything But Christmas&quot; is the only movie aired to date in which Ion Television had actually held a production interest), most of the films are produced by independent film and television studios such as Reel One Entertainment, Hybrid, LLC, The Cartel, and Vancouver-based MarVista Entertainment without the network&#x27;s financial involvement (Ion does not maintain exclusivity to most of the films, which are also distributed via syndicated film packages or carried by other networks); the network extended these themed made-for-TV movies to other holidays in 2015, with the premieres of the romance films &quot;Meet My Valentine&quot; (which aired as part of the network&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s Day programming slate) and &quot;You Cast a Spell on Me&quot; (which aired as part of its &quot;Wicked Week&quot; Halloween block).

On September 24, 2020, E. W. Scripps Company agreed to buy Ion Media for $2.65 billion. The transaction, which closed on January 7, 2021, saw Ion Television and its sister networks absorbed into Scripps&#x27; Katz Broadcasting subsidiary, which already operates five specialty networks, most notably Bounce TV and Court TV. In regards to Ion Television&#x27;s programming, Scripps indicated it would maintain the status quo, with no plans at the time to invest in original content or deviate from the channel&#x27;s off-network programming approach. To get FCC approval for the transaction, 23 Ion Television stations were sold by Scripps to Inyo Broadcast Holdings.

On April 8, 2024, Scripps announced that they would reposition Ion into a general entertainment channel, turning live sports broadcasting as a tentpole of the network with Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL) games occupying weekly slots in the programming lineup and to launch a refresh of their brand identity and new year-long brand campaign based on the new tagline from the new branding being &quot;Ion. It&#x27;s On&quot;, replacing &quot;Positively Entertaining&quot; after 16 years. Sister channels Ion Mystery and Ion Plus would also be rebranded with similar graphics based on Ion&#x27;s branding.

==Programming==

As of April 2024, Ion provides general entertainment programming to owned-and-operated and affiliated stations every day from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time (except Fridays outside of the Holiday season which start at 7:00 a.m. ET; awhile the entertainment programming schedule starts at 8:00 a.m. and ends at 1:00 a.m. from Christmas to New Year&#x27;s Day), with paid programming filling the remaining vacated hours. A children&#x27;s programming block of &quot;Science Max&quot; (one past Qubo series), and Xploration Station from Steve Rotfeld Productions – which features programs compliant with FCC educational programming requirements – airs for three hours each Friday at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Four hours overnight are programmed with compensated religious or commercial paid programming, a comparably small fraction of the paid programming schedule it aired in the past.

Ion owned-and-operated stations and affiliates formerly also provide limited local programming on weekday mornings to fulfill public affairs guidelines, which ranged from entirely local productions to Ion Life-sourced programs within which commercial slots are instead devoted to local physicians or experts giving locality-specific health advice or advertising their services. This programming has ended as the Main Studio Rule repeal by the FCC in 2019 freed Ion stations from this requirement. Ion also served as the over-the-air broadcast distribution point for TiVo&#x27;s &quot;Teleworld Paid Program&quot;, a weekly 30-minute compilation program – usually carried during the overnight on Wednesdays or Thursdays within the network&#x27;s designated paid programming time – it was specifically coded to distribute program previews and device tutorials for TiVo&#x27;s digital video recorders; in 2011, the time was used in early September to preview the pilot of Fox&#x27;s new sitcom &quot;New Girl&quot;, before its actual Fox premiere on September 20. TiVo discontinued the program in 2016 as broadband had become commonplace enough to end it.

Most programs broadcast by Ion Television are distributed by either NBCUniversal Syndication Studios, Disney–ABC Domestic Television, CBS Media Ventures, or Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution. Ion Television also maintains film distribution deals with Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Studios and Warner Bros. Pictures. Series broadcast by Ion Television () are mostly dramas such as &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;, and &quot;The Listener&quot;. As of 2014, the network&#x27;s format is predominantly devoted to marathon blocks of hour-long drama series, with consecutive episodes of a given series airing between two and 16 hours a day (depending on the day&#x27;s schedule, with fewer hours in the morning and late fringe).

The network broadcasts feature films released between the 1980s and the 2000s under the banner &quot;Ion Television at the Movies&quot;, which fill the majority of the network&#x27;s Sunday afternoon and evening schedule (holiday-themed made-for-TV films are also broadcast under the banner throughout the entertainment programming day on weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day regardless of where either holiday falls during the calendar week). Ion Television occasionally airs short, hosted segments during its prime-time lineup – particularly during film presentations – known as the &quot;Ion Lounge&quot;, a lifestyle segment used mainly to advertise a company&#x27;s product within the featured program&#x27;s commercial breaks.

In the recent past, Ion Television has aired a limited number of comedy or comedy-drama series that were cycled on-and-off the schedule such as &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Psych&quot; and &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, with half-hour sitcoms used on certain occasions to fill scheduling gaps prior to the telecast of its late-morning film presentations (usually in the 10:00 am. Central Time half-hour, if the succeeding film ran for at least 2 hours) because of their erratic scheduling; the network shifted to a more exclusive focus on dramas as part of its series content in January 2015, although the network continued to carry comedic programming in the form of select feature films aired within the &quot;Ion Television at the Movies&quot; block.

Ion&#x27;s method of running predominantly syndicated programming is very similar to the international model of broadcasting used in Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia and Australia, which mixes imported and syndicated shows with original programming – a model used only in United States broadcast television by digital multicast services (particularly those that specialize in acquired programs such as MeTV and Antenna TV), smaller English language entertainment-based networks (such as America One), PBS member stations, and networks broadcasting in languages other than English (such as Univision, UniMás, and Telemundo). The major commercial broadcast networks in the U.S. – ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox – carry first-run programs produced for the network, while leaving the responsibility of acquiring shows from the syndication market to their owned-and-operated stations and affiliates to fill time not allotted to network and, where applicable, locally produced programs (The CW and MyNetworkTV, which are somewhat similar to Ion Television in their formats, mixes elements of both models as acquired programs are supplied both during prime time by the services and by their stations at all other times). A limited number of non-Ion-owned stations that are merely affiliated with the network (such as former Louisville outlet WBNA) do carry additional local or syndicated programming that, in some instances, pre-empts certain programs within the Ion master schedule.

===Recent programming deals===
In 2006, Ion Media Networks reached several programming deals, two with major programming suppliers that were announced within a week of each other, and another that among other things would bring original programming to Ion Television&#x27;s lineup. On June 27, 2006, Ion Media announced a comprehensive programming deal with Warner Bros. Television Distribution, which gave it the broadcast rights to movies and television series owned by the company. One week later on July 5, 2006, Ion announced a similar deal that resulted in the acquisition of broadcast rights to films and series distributed by Sony Pictures Television (now Sony Pictures Television Studios). Starting in September of that year, series and feature films from both libraries were incorporated onto the network&#x27;s prime time schedule (including &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Designing Women&quot;, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, &quot;Green Acres&quot;, and &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;). However, these older series were later dropped when the network shifted towards more recent series. Ion also struck a library content deal with NBCUniversal, which gave it access to shows such as &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

In September 2008, Ion Television reached a multi-year film rights agreement with Warner Bros. Television Distribution to broadcast more recent movies from Warner Bros. and its related studios. Meanwhile, three series from CBS Television Distribution (now CBS Media Ventures) were added to the schedule: &quot;NCIS&quot; joined the lineup in September 2008, while &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot; were added to the Ion Television lineup in 2009. In January 2009, the network announced that it had acquired the broadcast rights to the Canadian television drama series &quot;Durham County&quot;; that show aired on the network for less than a year.

On January 21, 2011, Ion Television acquired the U.S. television rights to the Canadian drama series &quot;Flashpoint&quot;, which gave it first-run rights to the fourth season&#x27;s final 11 episodes, after CBS aired that season&#x27;s first eight episodes, as well as rights to air reruns of all episodes produced to date and thereafter; Ion (along with the show&#x27;s originating Canadian broadcaster, CTV) also renewed the series for a fifth and final season that aired during the fall of 2012.

In July 2011, Ion Television acquired the broadcast television rights to six films produced by Starz Media (now Lionsgate) as part of its weekend film block (then branded as the &quot;Big Movie Weekend&quot;); the films started airing on the network in November of that year. Ion also acquired the syndication rights to the USA Network series &quot;Psych&quot; and &quot;Monk&quot; from NBCUniversal; the two series respectively began airing in late 2011 and early 2012. &quot;House&quot;, also from NBCUniversal, joined the network in September 2012. In September 2011, Ion Television acquired the syndication rights to &quot;George Lopez&quot; and &quot;Leverage&quot;. &quot;George Lopez&quot; began airing on September 29, while &quot;Leverage&quot; debuted in July 2012, the former has since been dropped from the network, while the latter has been cycled on-and-off the schedule.

On October 4, 2011, Ion Television acquired the rights to the first two seasons of the Canadian drama &quot;The Listener&quot; for broadcast in 2012, with an option for future seasons through an agreement with Shaw Media (parent of the show&#x27;s originating broadcaster, Global); the series would not join Ion&#x27;s schedule until March 2014, by which time Ion Television had entered into a co-production arrangement for the program. A similar deal reached in September 2014 with Entertainment One gave Ion the American rights to the medical drama &quot;Saving Hope&quot; (which made its American debut on NBC in the summer of 2012); Ion began airing first-run episodes and repeats of the series in October 2015.

In December 2011, Ion Television acquired the syndication rights to &quot;Cold Case&quot;, which debuted in 2012. On June 25, 2012, Ion Television entered into a deal with WWE to air a new hour-long series titled &quot;WWE Main Event&quot; on Wednesday nights; the series debuted on October 3, 2012 and ran until April 2, 2014.

===Other programming===

====Children&#x27;s programming====
Prior to Ion Television&#x27;s original launch as Pax TV in 1998, the network had reached an agreement with DIC Entertainment to produce a five-hour children&#x27;s programming block called &quot;Freddy&#x27;s Firehouse&quot;, to air on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The block of animated series was instead launched on September 5, 1998, as &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, featuring a trio of winged teenage angels that hosted the wraparound segments that bridged breaks during the block&#x27;s shows, which were mostly sourced from the DIC library. &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; was discontinued in the spring of 1999, and was replaced by a new block under the title &quot;Pax Kids.&quot; The DIC programs were replaced in 2000 with reruns of &quot;Jack Hanna&#x27;s Animal Adventures&quot;, which was replaced by &quot;Just Deal&quot; and &quot;California Dreams&quot; the following year. Pax TV became the first major commercial broadcast network in the U.S. to not supply children&#x27;s programming in January 2002, and later one of only two until it restored a children&#x27;s block in 2006 (UPN eventually joined it in this distinction after it dropped its Disney&#x27;s One Too block in August 2003, following the termination of a programming agreement with Buena Vista Television). Between 2002 and 2006, Pax and i used original reality series such as &quot;Miracle Pets&quot;, &quot;Animal Tails&quot;, and &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Kids&quot; to fulfill its stations&#x27; E/I requirements.

On September 15, 2006, Ion Television debuted a weekly children&#x27;s program block called &quot;Qubo on Ion Television&quot;, through a partnership between Ion Media Networks, NBC Universal, the Nelvana unit of Corus Entertainment, Scholastic Media, Classic Media, and its subsidiary Big Idea Productions. The Qubo block originally debuted on NBC and Telemundo on September 9, 2006, with NBC&#x27;s Qubo block initially being rebroadcast on Ion Television on Friday afternoons (making it the last weekday afternoon children&#x27;s block to be carried by a major commercial broadcast network until 2010). On January 4, 2015, the Qubo block on Ion was relaunched as the &quot;Qubo Kids Corner&quot;, concurrent with the block&#x27;s move to Sunday mornings. As mentioned above, Scripps now purchases syndicated programming to meet Ion Television&#x27;s E/I requirements with its wind-down of Qubo.

====Sports====

The network has previously broadcast certain sporting events, including Conference USA college football games (produced by College Sports Television), soccer matches from the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association, Real Pro Wrestling (which more resembles the amateur form than the theatrically-based ring sport), the Champions Tour of golf, the Paralympic Games and a weekly mixed martial arts program from &quot;BodogFight&quot;. In its home state of Florida, the network&#x27;s stations had served as a statewide chain to carry play-by-play coverage of a number of games for Major League Baseball&#x27;s Tampa Bay Rays and Florida Marlins (demarcated by each team&#x27;s territories) until the late 2000s, when cable&#x27;s Fox Sports Florida and Sun (now Bally Sports Florida and Sun) acquired the exclusive rights to both teams.

Ion Television aired NFL Films&#x27; weekly highlight program, the &quot;NFL Films Game of the Week&quot; on Saturday evenings from September 16, 2007, to January 5, 2008, with its initial broadcast focusing on the September 9, 2007 game between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys. The series was not renewed for the fall 2008 season. Ion also obtained rights to televise games from the American Indoor Football Association, which were slated to begin airing in March 2008. However, the game&#x27;s producers did not provide a live broadcast and the agreement was terminated.

On December 28, 2010, Ion Television signed a deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship to air the preliminary fights to the January 1 pay-per-view event UFC 125. Ion also aired the preliminary fights for UFC 127 and UFC 140 later in 2011, before the organization signed an exclusive programming agreement with Fox.

On April 20, 2023, Ion Television, through Scripps Sports, signed a multi-year deal with the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) to air a 15-week slate of doubleheader games on Friday nights (branded as &quot;WNBA Friday Night Spotlight on ION&quot;), beginning with that year&#x27;s regular season. It will be the first national sports broadcast carried by Ion since 2011, and marks the first ever television contract for Scripps Sports, which was founded by the E. W. Scripps Company in December 2022 to acquire sports events for Ion and the group&#x27;s local television stations. The agreement also grants local rights to selected Ion O&amp;Os for games involving regional WNBA teams, which stations may carry in early- or late-evening broadcast windows depending on tip-off time.

On November 9, 2023, the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League announced Scripps Sports as a rightsholder beginning in the 2024 season, with Ion to air Saturday night doubleheaders. Ion will also air the 2024 NWSL Draft.

==Affiliates==
, Ion has 64 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with nine additional television stations encompassing 36 states and the District of Columbia. The network has an estimated national reach of 60.63% of all households in the United States (or 189,453,097 Americans with at least one television set). Ion Television has the most owned-and-operated stations of any commercial broadcast network in the United States, reaching 65.1% of the United States (well above the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s coverage-based national ownership limit of 39%); it is also the only American commercial broadcast network whose stations almost exclusively consist of network-owned stations, similar to the ownership model of many commercial broadcast networks in Europe, Canada, Latin America, Asia and Australia, and to a somewhat more expansive extent, many U.S.-based religious broadcast networks.

Ion&#x27;s programming is available by default via a national feed that is distributed directly to pay television providers in markets without a local Ion station (this contrasts with the major networks, which under FCC regulations, allow providers to import an owned-and-operated or affiliate station from a nearby market if no local over-the-air affiliate exists). In some markets, DirecTV carries a &quot;placeholder&quot; simulcast of the national modified feed of the network (for example, Los Angeles area viewers can watch Ion on both channels 30, via local O&amp;O KPXN-TV, and 306; New York City on channel 31 WPXN besides 305).

In most markets with a Scripps or Inyo-owned Ion station outside early mornings, the only sign of the network being carried on a broadcast television station is a small automatically generated station identification on the bottom of the screen at the top of each hour containing the call letters, city of license and state abbreviation, which is repeated across its subchannels.

===Major market absences and station oddities===
Ion does not have any over-the-air stations in several major markets.

Two major factors that have limited the network&#x27;s national broadcast coverage are that unlike the major commercial broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, and Fox), Ion did not actively seek over-the-air distribution on the digital subchannels of other network-affiliated stations in the five years following the digital television transition (with limited exceptions in Las Vegas, Nevada, Tucson, Arizona and Fresno, California through agreements with Telemundo owned-and- operated stations in those markets), until it reached a multi-station agreement with Media General in November 2015; prior to that deal, it long had very few stations that contractually carry the network&#x27;s programming (with limited exceptions in markets such as Louisville, Kentucky and Anchorage, Alaska). As a result, Ion Media Networks owns the vast majority of the stations within Ion Television&#x27;s affiliate body, as well as those of co-owned multicast services Qubo Channel and Ion Life.

In Pittsburgh, a deal by Paxson to buy WPCB-TV and trade it for secondary PBS member station WQEX was approved by the Federal Communications Commission, but rejected by WPCB-TV owner Cornerstone Television in a 2000 controversy; it would not be until November 2010 that Paxson&#x27;s successor, Ion Media Networks, would successfully buy WQEX, which has since been converted into a commercially licensed outlet as Ion O&amp;O WINP-TV. In Charlotte, independent station WAXN-TV carried some programming aired by the network during its original iteration as Pax TV from 1998 to 2000, but never maintained a formal affiliation. Under an agreement with Fox Television Stations, Ion was added to the fourth digital subcarrier of then owned-and-operated station WJZY on September 29, 2016. Ion in Charlotte later moved to the DT6 feed of WJZY-TV.

St. Louis, at one time, received the network by way of a low-power repeater of O&amp;O WPXS in nearby Mount Vernon, Illinois; in December 2013, the United States bankruptcy court approved a plan by creditors of Roberts Broadcasting to transfer East St. Louis-based MyNetworkTV affiliate WRBU and its sister stations, CW affiliate WZRB in Columbia, South Carolina and former CW affiliate WAZE-LP in Evansville, Indiana, to a trust with Ion Media Networks – a creditor in Roberts&#x27; Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, for which it filed in 2011 – that would serve as its beneficiary. Roberts&#x27; attorney subsequently stated that Ion would purchase the three stations. WZRB and WRBU switched to Ion in February 2014 (although WZRB retained a secondary affiliation with The CW until MyNetworkTV affiliate WKTC joined the programming service in March); WRBU dropped MyNetworkTV upon becoming an Ion O&amp;O (MyNetworkTV would not return to St. Louis until November 2014, when CBS affiliate KMOV launched a third digital subchannel to serve as an affiliate). WAZE-LP was silent at the time of acquisition, having gone dark the previous year after failing to construct its digital transmitter facilities, and Ion eventually decided on an affiliation deal with Nexstar Media Group&#x27;s cluster in the area instead, using a subchannel of CW affiliate WTVW.

Buffalo and Rochester, New York, normally treated as separate markets, share Ion affiliate WPXJ-TV, which is centrally located between the two cities and is licensed to Batavia. An equivalent case exists involving Battle Creek, Michigan-licensed WZPX-TV, which serves both the Grand Rapids and Lansing markets (it also unusually served as a secondary WB affiliate due to a lack of stations in both markets until the digital age); additionally, Ann Arbor-licensed WPXD-TV also once provided an equivalent over-the-air signal for Lansing before moving their signal to a new transmitter in the Detroit suburb of Southfield in 2012.

In addition, in several other markets, Ion&#x27;s predecessor was sold to another television station group to affiliate with a different English or Spanish language network, and through either a lack of channel space or interest in the network, Ion would not reappear in most of those markets until reaching deals to air on digital subchannels of other stations. These include:
* Albuquerque, New Mexico: KAPX (now UniMás owned-and-operated station KTFQ, Ion now on KWBQ 19.4)
* Baraboo, Wisconsin: W43BR (now a Family Channel affiliate, Ion now in Madison on WIFS 57.9)
* Baton Rouge, Louisiana: WLFT-CD (now a religious independent station, Ion now on WVLA 33.3)
* Champaign–Springfield, Illinois: WPXU (now CW affiliate WBUI, Ion now on WAND 17.3)
* Charlottesville, Virginia: WADA-LP (now WVIR-CD (translator of NBC affiliate WVIR-TV), Ion now on WCAV 19.4)
* Fresno–Visalia, California: KPXF (now UniMás owned-and-operated station KTFF, and was formerly on KNSO 51.3)
* Little Rock, Arkansas: KYPX (now MeTV affiliate KMYA; Ion now on KARZ 42.3)
* Montgomery, Alabama: WBMM (first switched to Daystar, now a CW affiliate, Ion now on WAKA 8.3)
* Reno, Nevada: KREN (now an Univision affiliate, Ion now on KTVN 2.3)
* Shreveport, Louisiana: KPXJ (now a CW affiliate, Ion now on KSHV 45.3)
* Sioux Falls, South Dakota: KAUN-LP (now a Retro TV affiliate, Ion now on KELO 11.3)
* Tucson, Arizona: KUVE-DT (now an Univision owned-and-operated station, then on KOLD 13.4. Now on KGUN-TV 9.5)
* Las Vegas/Pahrump, Nevada: KPVM-LD (Now independent; formerly on KLAS-TV subchannel, now on KMCC)
* San Juan, Puerto Rico/Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands: WJPX (now an América TeVé affiliate, Ion now on WSVI 8)

In November 2015, Media General and Ion came to terms on an affiliation deal to add Ion&#x27;s main feed as a standard definition digital subchannel in non-Ion O&amp;O markets with Media General stations to replace the programming of the long-defunct Live Well Network, the first of its kind for Ion. Ion subchannels were added in markets such as Austin, Texas; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Lafayette, Indiana; Davenport, Iowa; Lafayette, Louisiana; Lansing, Michigan; Richmond, Virginia; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Wichita, Kansas. These deals would carry over after the Media General stations were integrated into the Nexstar Media Group in January 2017, with WBAY-TV continuing to carry Ion under Gray Television ownership. Morgan Murphy Media&#x27;s two Wisconsin stations (WISC-TV in Madison and WKBT-DT in La Crosse–Eau Claire) began to carry the network as a third subchannel at the beginning of February 2017. The network further expanded its affiliate reach into small and lower-ranked mid-sized markets during late 2016 and 2017, with Ion Media striking additional deals with companies such as Gray Television, Hubbard Broadcasting, Block Communications, Forum Communications, Heartland Media and the Meredith Corporation to carry Ion Television on digital subchannels of stations owned and/or operated by those groups.

In the fall of 2021, with the purchase of Ion Media by Scripps, it began to end outside contracts in markets with a Scripps station where Ion Television was on a subchannel rather than an Ion station, with the network being activated on Scripps-owned stations as a subchannel on WGBA-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin (ending the subchannel deal with WBAY), KGUN-TV in Tucson, Arizona (from KOLD-TV), Richmond, Virginia&#x27;s WTVR-TV (taking over from WRIC-TV), KRIS-TV in Corpus Christi, Texas (from KIII), and WFTX-TV in the Fort Myers, Florida market (rectifying the network&#x27;s longest absence, as the market previously had no Ion station at all).

In several markets, the station&#x27;s city of license is considered outside the main portion of a market&#x27;s metropolitan area. Such cases include Minneapolis–Saint Paul, where that area&#x27;s Ion O&amp;O, KPXM-TV, is licensed to St. Cloud ( northwest of the Twin Cities); Detroit, where affiliate WPXD-TV is licensed to Ann Arbor, Michigan ( west of Detroit), though its digital transmitter is located in Southfield, where the bulk of Detroit&#x27;s television stations base their studios and transmitter facilities; Hartford, where affiliate WHPX-TV is licensed to New London, Connecticut (located to the southeast), which moved its transmitter to the Farmington Rattlesnake Mountain site in the digital age; and Milwaukee, where O&amp;O WPXE-TV is licensed to Kenosha, with its digital transmitter located at a tower farm on Milwaukee&#x27;s north side (its former analog transmitter was located south of the city in Racine County). In the Cleveland market, Ion airs on Akron-based WVPX-TV, which had formerly targeted Akron, Canton and nearby areas as an ABC affiliate (then competing with the market&#x27;s existing ABC station WEWS) prior to 1998.

===Multiplexing===
Ion Television&#x27;s stations have made notable use of &quot;multiplexing&quot; or splitting a digital broadcast television signal into separate subchannels. The network&#x27;s stations usually carry up to six of these digital subchannels (in contrast with most other full-power stations, which usually carry a maximum of four channels over the same signal), each of which broadcast separate networks. Due to the bandwidth limitations caused by its carriage of multiple subchannels over a single broadcast signal, only the primary Ion network feed is transmitted in high definition, a mode of operation that remains under Scripps ownership. A small number of Ion stations have channel sharing agreements with other broadcasters after the FCC&#x27;s 2016 spectrum re-allocation auction, while others such as Atlanta-area station WPXA-TV contract with other lower-power stations in a market to provide a full-power signal, such as Telemundo affiliate WKTB-CD.

====Subchannels====

=====Qubo=====

Qubo was a children&#x27;s television network that launched on January 8, 2007, and is carried on the second digital subchannel of Ion Television&#x27;s stations. Its launch was announced on May 8, 2006, when Ion Media Networks, NBCUniversal, Nelvana, Scholastic Media, Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics which would later be owned by NBCUniversal) and its Big Idea Productions unit announced plans to create Qubo as a multi-platform children&#x27;s entertainment endeavor that would extend to a weekly programming block on Ion Television as well as NBC and Telemundo, and a video-on-demand service for digital cable providers. Qubo features content from the programming libraries of each of the partners, though there was an early promise of each company producing a new series for the network each year; most of its programs are targeted at children ages 2 to 11, though its late night programming block &quot;Qubo Night Owl&quot; (which originally featured animated series from Qubo&#x27;s partners and the Filmation library, but after August 2013 features a mix of animated and live-action series sourced solely from the distribution partners) is aimed at older teenagers and adults.

The network debuted on January 8, 2007. Its initial format was composed of a four-hour block of shows that repeated six times a day, all featuring programming exclusive to the new channel; by 2010, the channel adopted a more traditional schedule featuring a larger array of programs. As a consequence to the pending launch of Qubo, the &quot;i&quot; secondary feed was replaced on &quot;i&quot; O&amp;Os with a repeating promo loop in late September 2006. NBCUniversal dropped out of the venture in 2012, with NBC and sister network Telemundo replacing their Qubo blocks with their own E/I-compliant children&#x27;s lineups programmed by PBS Kids Sprout (now Universal Kids, which is part-owned by NBCUniversal&#x27;s corporate parent Comcast) that July, relegating Qubo&#x27;s companion programming block exclusively to Ion Television and Ion Plus; Ion Media Networks acquired the stakes of the remaining partners in the channel, which all retained distribution partnerships with Qubo, in 2013.

Programming on Qubo Channel and its companion block on Ion Television and Ion Plus accounted for all educational programming content on Ion&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations, thus relieving the network from the responsibility of carrying programs compliant with Children&#x27;s Television Act guidelines on its other subchannel services.

Qubo ceased broadcasting after Ion Media&#x27;s acquisition by the E. W. Scripps Company and merger with Katz Broadcasting.

===== Ion Plus =====

Ion Plus (originally named &quot;iHealth&quot; prior to its launch and &quot;Ion Life&quot; until July 1, 2019) launched on February 19, 2007, and was carried on the third digital subchannel of Ion Television&#x27;s stations. Under its former format, the network mainly featured health and lifestyle programs, as well as feature films on Sunday mornings and select weeknights (which consist mainly of those its parent network is scheduled to air during the given month as part of the &quot;Ion Television at the Movies&quot; block); some extreme sports programming previously aired on weekend evenings until July 2014. Much of Ion Life&#x27;s programming consists of Canadian-imported programs, with some limited U.S.-produced programming. The network originally maintained a 24-hour entertainment schedule until 2013, when Ion Life added a limited number of infomercials in mid-morning and midday timeslots. As of July 1, 2019, it was rebranded to Ion Plus, acting as a &quot;de facto&quot; extension of the main Ion service, featuring all-day marathon scheduling of one series, along with the same scheduling of paid programming.

Ion Plus ceased broadcasting over-the-air after Ion Media&#x27;s acquisition by the E. W. Scripps Company and merger with Katz Broadcasting on February 28, 2021, but continues to air as an advertising-supported video-on-demand network through several AVOD streaming services, including Samsung TV Plus, and Vizio WatchFree.

On June 17, 2024, Scripps quietly posted a promotional video to the social media presences of Ion Plus and Defy TV that the latter would be wound down at the end of June (its programming moving to another unrelated network provisionally known as Dare, launching that day, but which was sold the Defy branding shortly before its debut and returned to the air with the same brand and imaging), with Ion Plus returning to over-the-air availability on July 1; &quot;MacGyver&quot; and &quot;Scorpion&quot; will be added to Ion Plus to augment its schedule as the mainline Ion network adds further sports programming to its schedule.

=====Ion Shop=====
In April 2012, Ion Media Networks launched a new service known as &quot;Ion Shop&quot; (originally &quot;iShop&quot; prior to November 2012, and &quot;ShopTV&quot; thereafter, both are names used only by the PSIP identifiers on digital television tuners and converter boxes; there was never explicit on-air branding used by the channel itself); some Ion owned-and-operated stations, however, did not begin carrying the network until as late as that November. Carried as a fourth digital subchannel on Ion Television&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations, it primarily carried informercials; until June 2013, Ion Shop also aired blocks of programming from Ion Life in some morning and late night timeslots.

Ion Shop ceased operations on February 28, 2021.

=====Ion Mystery=====

On February 24, 2022, the Court TV Mystery network was rebranded as Ion Mystery, with the &quot;Ion&quot; brand now more established regarding procedural dramas in general, including Ion Mystery&#x27;s overall programming, whereas Court TV is more associated with its news division.

=====QVC Over the Air=====

On August 5, 2013, as part of a partnership between QVC and Ion Media Networks to expand the channel&#x27;s broadcast television coverage, Ion Television began carrying the cable and satellite home shopping network via a fifth digital subchannel on most of its owned-and-operated stations. Although the network maintains a high-definition simulcast feed, QVC is transmitted in standard definition to preserve channel bandwidth to allow the primary Ion network feed to transmit in HD, with the normally letterboxed SD feed squeezed to full-screen to fit 4:3 television sets (preventing windowboxing of the subchannel on 16:9 sets). QVC is also broadcast on digital subchannels of low-powered television stations (mainly those not owned by Ion Media Networks) in selected areas, including in some areas where an Ion station also carries it. The channel&#x27;s broadcast service is branded as &quot;QVC Over the Air&quot;, with an accompanying on-screen bug appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network&#x27;s programming; the service can be differentiated from the cable network due to the use of a different toll-free number and QR code on-screen to account for any sales made from shoppers through the over the air version of the network. Some Ion-affiliated and owned stations have declined to carry QVC&#x27;s programming because of other partnerships between QVC and other broadcasters, along with other spectrum agreements to carry other stations and networks; this is also the case with HSN in the next section. The partnership remains in effect in many markets under Scripps ownership and Inyo affiliations, though some stations ended distribution of the network after February 2021 in favor of the Katz networks.

=====Home Shopping Network=====

On November 18, 2013, Ion Television began carrying the Home Shopping Network via a sixth digital subchannel on most of its owned-and-operated stations, as part of a partnership with Ion Media Networks (both once controlled by Lowell &quot;Bud&quot; Paxson) to expand the channel&#x27;s broadcast coverage. Although it has a high definition simulcast feed, HSN is transmitted by Ion stations in standard definition, due to the same digital multiplexing limitations that prevent QVC from being carried in 16:9 SD or HD. HSN has been widely available over-the-air throughout the United States since its inception – through stations that the network had owned prior to the 1998 reorganization of its Silver King Broadcasting group into USA Broadcasting (some of which were converted into general entertainment independent outlets, and were later sold to Univision Communications to form the charter stations of the present-day UniMás network), and had been mainly available on low-power television stations immediately prior to its subchannel-leasing agreement with Ion; HSN is carried on low-power stations in some markets where an Ion station also carries the network, though HSN&#x27;s programming is exclusive to an existing affiliate in a few areas where both networks are present (such as Atlanta, where WPXA-TV formerly simulcast Telemundo affiliate WKTB-CD on its DT6 subchannel under a time-leasing arrangement until the sale of that station to Gray Television and its move to WANF&#x27;s spectrum, and W13DQ-D carries HSN). Some Ion-affiliated stations decline to carry HSN&#x27;s programming, and some Ion Media-owned stations are unable to carry that network due to affiliation agreements between HSN and other broadcasters that existed prior to the Ion deal. The partnership remains in effect in many markets under Scripps ownership and Inyo affiliations, though some stations ended distribution of the network after February 2021 in favor of the Katz networks.

===National feeds===
Separate national feeds (formerly known as &quot;i Plus&quot; or &quot;Ion Plus&quot;) have been made available to pay television providers, including Dish Network, DirecTV, Comcast and Charter Communications. A separate advertising-supported video-on-demand feed is also available through several AVOD streaming services, including Samsung TV Plus, Vizio WatchFree, Xumo, Tubi, Freevee, The Roku Channel, and TCL Channel, which features programming sourced from Ion Plus in place of paid programming that airs on the main network. Prior to the launch of Ion Life, the Ion Plus feeds carried reruns of cancelled Pax original programs (such as &quot;Miracle Pets&quot; and &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;), as well as public domain movies and sitcom episodes (such as &quot;I Married Joan&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;). The feeds used the Pax name and bug after the network&#x27;s rebrand as &quot;i&quot;, until about September 2005. As Ion has refocused towards its current schedule however, along with a de-emphasis on local advertising, the national pay-TV feed effectively repeats Ion&#x27;s main feed outside a lack of station identification.

<text>Zeno (; ; – 9 April 491) was Eastern Roman emperor from 474 to 475 and again from 476 to 491. His reign was plagued by domestic revolts and religious dissension, but was more successful on the foreign front. He is credited with further stabilizing the Eastern empire, while the Western Roman Empire fell following the deposition of Romulus Augustulus.

Born in Isauria, Zeno was known as Tarasis before adopting his Greek name and becoming an ally of Emperor Leo I, who saw the Isaurian general as an important counterweight against the Germanic leader Aspar. In 466, he married Leo I&#x27;s daughter, Ariadne, with whom he had a son, Leo. On the death of Leo I in 474, Zeno&#x27;s seven-year-old son took the throne as Leo II, with Zeno made co-emperor shortly after. Leo II died of an illness later that year, leaving Zeno as the sole emperor.

Despite his early success in making peace with the Vandals, Zeno was an unpopular emperor due to his barbarian origins. In early 475, he was forced to flee Constantinople in a revolt orchestrated in part by dowager Empress Verina, which concluded with Leo I&#x27;s brother-in-law Basiliscus installing himself as emperor. Seeking refuge in his native Isauria, Zeno later took advantage of Basiliscus&#x27;s own flagging popularity, convinced the generals Illus and Armatus to defect, marched on the capital and reclaimed the throne in mid-476. Meanwhile, in the western empire, Germanic leader Odoacer deposed the final Western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, and sent the imperial regalia to Constantinople. He expressly acknowledged the suzerainty of Zeno over the West, making Zeno the theoretical sole ruler of a reunified empire. In return, Zeno recognised Odoacer&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; reign in Italy.

In the late 470s and 480s Zeno faced several revolts, including one from his brother-in-law Marcianus and one from Illus, both of which he ultimately suppressed. He also attempted to deal with hostilities from the two Ostrogothic leaders, Theodoric the Amal (Theodoric the Great) and Theodoric Strabo, by playing them against each other. Following Strabo&#x27;s early death, Zeno was able to achieve a lasting peace with Theodoric by sending him to Italy, where he defeated Odoacer and established the Ostrogothic Kingdom.

In religious matters, Zeno issued the &quot;Henotikon&quot; in 482 on the advice of Acacius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, in an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile the differences between the Chalcedonians and the Miaphysites over the nature of Christ. Pope Felix III condemned the document and excommunicated Acacius in 484, beginning the Acacian schism which lasted until 519. Zeno died without an heir in 491 and was succeeded by Anastasius I Dicorus, a courtier chosen by Empress Ariadne.

== Biography ==

=== Rise to power ===

==== Early life ====
Zeno&#x27;s original name was Tarasis or more fully &quot;Tarasikodissa ()&quot; in his native Isaurian language, meaning &quot;Tarasis&quot; son of &quot;Kodissa&quot;. Tarasis was born in Isauria, Cilicia, at Rusumblada, later renamed Zenopolis in Zeno&#x27;s honour. His father was called Kodisa (as attested by his patronymic &quot;Tarasicodissa&quot;), his mother Lallis, his brother Longinus. Tarasis had a first wife, Arcadia, whose name indicates a relationship with the Constantinopolitan aristocracy, and whose statue was erected near the Baths of Arcadius, along the steps that led to Topoi. Near Eastern and other Christian traditions maintain that Zeno had two daughters, Hilaria and Theopiste, who followed a religious life, but historical sources attest the existence of only one son by Arcadia, called Zenon. According to ancient sources, Flavius Zeno&#x27;s prestigious career—he had fought against Attila in 447 to defend Constantinople and been consul the following year—was the reason why Tarasis, another Isaurian officer, chose the Greek name Zeno when he married into the Imperial family, thus being known as Zeno when he rose to the throne. Some modern historians suggest that the Isaurian general Flavius Zeno was the father of the emperor, but there is no consensus about this, and other sources suggest that Tarasis was a member of Zeno&#x27;s entourage. A Byzantine Princess, putative daughter of Zeno and first wife Arcadia, named Helen, married as his second wife Saint Vakhtang I Gorgasali, King of Iberia, and had issue.

The Isaurians were a people who lived inland from the Mediterranean coast of Anatolia, in the core of the Taurus Mountains (generally what is now the Konya/Bozkir area of Turkey). Like most borderland tribes, they were looked upon as barbarians by the Romans even though they had been Roman subjects for more than five centuries. However, being Nicene Christians rather than Arians, as the Goths and other Germanic tribes were, they were not formally barred from the throne.

According to some scholars, in the mid-460s, the Eastern Roman Emperor, Leo I, wanted to balance the weight of the Germanic component of the army, whose leader was the Alan &quot;magister militum&quot; Aspar. He thought that Tarasis and his Isaurians could be that counterweight, and called him, with many Isaurians, to Constantinople. This interpretation, however, has been contested. By the mid-460s, Arcadia and Zeno had been living at Constantinople for some time, where Lallis and Longinus also lived, the latter married to a Valeria, possibly a woman of aristocratic rank.

According to ancient sources, the earliest reference to Tarasis dates back to 464, when he put his hands on some letters written by Aspar&#x27;s son, Ardabur, which proved that the son of the &quot;magister militum&quot; had incited the Sassanid King to invade Roman territory, promising to support the invasion. Through these letters, which Tarasis gave to Leo, the Emperor could dismiss Ardabur, who at the time was &quot;magister militum per Orientem&quot; and &quot;patricius&quot;, thus reducing Aspar&#x27;s influence and ambition. As reward for his loyalty, which Leo praised to Daniel the Stylite, Tarasis was appointed &quot;comes domesticorum&quot;, an office of great influence and prestige. This appointment could mean that Tarasis had been a &quot;protector domesticus&quot;, either at Leo&#x27;s court in Constantinople, or attached at Ardabur&#x27;s staff in Antioch.

In 465, Leo and Aspar quarrelled about the appointment of consuls for the following year; it was on this occasion that Tarasis&#x27; position was strengthened, as he became friend and ally of the Emperor.

==== Son-in-law of Leo I ====

To make himself more acceptable to the Roman hierarchy and the population of Constantinople, Tarasis adopted the Greek name of Zeno and used it for the rest of his life. In mid-late 466, Zeno married Ariadne, elder daughter of Leo I and Verina; there is no reference to him divorcing Arcadia who evidently died prior to this. The next year their son was born, and Zeno became father of the heir apparent to the throne, as the only son of Leo I had died in his infancy; to stress his claim to the throne, the boy was called Leo. Zeno, however, was not present at the birth of his son, as in 467, he participated in a military campaign against the Goths.
Zeno, as a member of the &quot;protectores domestici&quot;, did not take part in the disastrous expedition against the Vandals, led in 468 by Leo&#x27;s brother-in-law Basiliscus. The following year, during which he held the honour of the consulate, he was appointed &quot;magister militum per Thracias&quot; and led an expedition in Thrace. The sources do not clearly state what enemy he fought there, and historians had proposed either Goths or Huns, or the rebels of Anagastes. Either way, before leaving, Leo and Zeno asked for Daniel the Stylite&#x27;s opinion about the campaign, and Daniel answered that Zeno would be the target of a conspiracy but would escape unharmed. Indeed, Leo sent some of his personal soldiers with Zeno to protect him, but they were bribed by Aspar to capture him instead. Zeno was informed of their intention and fled to Serdica, and, because of this episode, Leo grew even more suspicious of Aspar.

After the attack, Zeno did not return to Constantinople, where Aspar and Ardabur were, still with considerable power. Instead, he moved to the &quot;Long Wall&quot; (the Long Wall of the Thracian Chersonese or, less probably, the Anastasian Wall), then to Pylai and from there to Chalcedon. While waiting here for an opportunity to return to the capital, he was appointed &quot;magister militum per Orientem&quot;. He took the monk Peter the Fuller with him and left for Antioch, his office&#x27;s see, passing through Isauria, where he put down the rebellion of Indacus. Zeno stayed at Antioch for two years.

While living in Antioch with his family, Zeno sympathised with the Monophysite views of Peter the Fuller, and supported him against his opponent, the Chalcedonian bishop Martyrius. Monks from nearby monasteries journeyed to Antioch to support Peter, and Zeno first allowed them into the city and then failed to effectively repress their violence. Martyrius went to Constantinople to ask Leo for help, but, on returning to Antioch, he was informed that Peter had been elected bishop, and resigned (470). Leo reacted by ordering Peter into exile and addressing to Zeno a law that forbade the monks from leaving their monasteries or fomenting rebellion (1 June 471). In 470/471, Zeno had also to deal with an invasion of Tzanni, who attacked Roman Armenia.

With Zeno far from Constantinople, Aspar had increased his influence by having his son Patricius appointed &quot;caesar&quot; and married to Leo I&#x27;s younger daughter, Leontia (470). Sources are contradictory on the causes, but clearly state that in 471, Leo I had Aspar and Ardabur treacherously killed. This certainly occurred with Zeno&#x27;s and Basiliscus&#x27; approval, as, on the eve of the murders, the two generals had moved closer to Constantinople (Zeno was at Chalcedon). Thereafter, Zeno returned to Constantinople and was appointed &quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot;.

=== Reign ===

==== First reign and Basiliscus&#x27; revolt (475–476) ====

In October 473, Leo I appointed as &quot;caesar&quot; his grandson Leo II, the son of Zeno and Ariadne. On 18 January 474, Leo I died; if Leo II had not already been proclaimed co-emperor by his grandfather, he would have become &quot;augustus&quot; on that occasion. Since Leo II was seven years old (too young to rule himself) Ariadne and her mother Verina prevailed upon him to crown Zeno, his father, as co-emperor, which he did on 29 January 474. When Leo II became ill and died, Zeno became sole emperor.

Zeno had to settle matters with the Vandal King, Genseric, who was conducting raids against the Empire&#x27;s coastal cities, threatening key commercial sea routes. Zeno sent Genseric a high-ranking officer as ambassador, Severus, who succeeded in stipulating an &quot;eternal&quot; peace between the Vandals and the Empire, which allowed the Romans to pay ransoms for the prisoners in Vandal hands and which ended the Vandal persecution of Nicene Christians in their territory.

Despite this success, Zeno continued to be unpopular with the people and Senate because of his barbarian origins; his right to the throne was limited to his marriage with Ariadne and his relationship to Verina, the dowager Empress. Therefore, he chose to draw support from the Isaurian component of the army, in particular, the Isaurian generals Illus and Trocundes, both brothers. However, Verina decided to overthrow her son-in-law Zeno and replace him with her lover, the ex-&quot;magister officiorum&quot; Patricius, with the help of her brother Basiliscus. The conspirators fomented riots in the capital against the Isaurian emperor; Basiliscus succeeded also in convincing Illus, Trocundes and the Ostrogothic general Theodoric Strabo to join the plot.
On 9 January 475, Zeno was forced to flee Constantinople to Isauria with his wife and mother, some Isaurian fellows and the Imperial treasure. Illus and Trocundes were sent to chase him, and Zeno was compelled to shut himself up in a fortress, where Illus besieged him, also capturing Zeno&#x27;s brother Longinus and keeping him as a hostage.

However, the conspirators quickly fell in conflict with each other. Basiliscus took the throne for himself, putting to death Verina&#x27;s lover and candidate, Patricius. He also allowed the mob to kill all of the Isaurians left in Constantinople, an episode that damaged relations with the Isaurian generals Illus and Trocundes. Basiliscus appointed his nephew Armatus &quot;magister militum&quot;, thus alienating Theodoric Strabo. Since Zeno had left no money, Basiliscus was forced to levy heavy taxes. Finally, he alienated the Church by supporting the Monophysites. The people of Constantinople also put the blame on him for a great fire that burned several parts of the city. With the secret support of the Senate, and bribes paid by Zeno, Illus agreed to switch sides and united his army with Zeno&#x27;s, marching on Constantinople. Basiliscus tried to recover popular support and sent another army against Zeno, under his nephew Armatus&#x27; command. Zeno succeeded in bribing Armatus too, promising to confirm his rank of &quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot; for life and promoting his son (also called Basiliscus) to the rank of &quot;caesar&quot;; Armatus&#x27; army failed to intercept Zeno&#x27;s troops during their march on Constantinople.

In August 476, Zeno besieged Constantinople. The Senate opened the gates of the city to the Isaurian, allowing the deposed emperor to resume the throne. Basiliscus fled with his family to the baptistery of Hagia Sophia. Betrayed by the Patriarch Acacius, he surrendered himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood. Basiliscus and his family were sent to a fortress in Cappadocia, where Zeno had them enclosed in a dry cistern, to die from exposure.

After his restoration, Zeno fulfilled his promises, letting Armatus keep his title of &quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot; (possibly even raising him to the rank of &quot;patricius&quot;) and appointing his son Basiliscus &quot;Caesar&quot; in Nicaea.

In 477, however, Zeno changed his mind, probably instigated by Illus, who stood to gain from the fall of Armatus. Armatus was executed, his property confiscated, and his son Basiliscus removed from power and ordained as a priest.

====End of the Western Empire====

The western emperor Olybrius died in the autumn of 472. Gundobad, the western &quot;magister militum&quot;, then proclaimed Glycerius, the &quot;comes domesticorum&quot; (commander of the Imperial guard) as western emperor in Ravenna. Leo I refused to endorse Glycerius and elevated his nephew Julius Nepos to co-emperor for the west in 473. Expecting resistance, Nepos was forced by bad winter weather to delay his voyage until the next year; it was therefore left to Zeno, as Leo&#x27;s successor, to support Julius Nepos&#x27; installation in Ravenna. Nepos arrived in Italy, quickly deposed Glycerius who offered no resistance, and was proclaimed emperor by the Roman Senate in June 474. Julius was on good terms with Zeno, and he even minted coins in the names of Zeno, Leo II and himself.
In August 475, during Basiliscus&#x27; reign, while Zeno was in Isauria blocked by Illus&#x27; army, Orestes, the western &quot;magister militum&quot;, revolted, forcing Nepos to flee Italy for Dalmatia; Orestes proclaimed his own son Romulus Augustus emperor, but was unable to gain the allegiance of the remnants of the Western Empire outside of Italy. One year later, while Zeno was entering Constantinople to end Basiliscus&#x27; brief usurpation, Romulus and Orestes were overthrown by the Chieftain Odoacer. With the support of Odoacer, the Roman Senate sent an envoy to present the imperial insignia to the restored Zeno. They asked Zeno to dissolve the separation of the empire and rule as sole Emperor; also, to appoint Odoacer both &quot;patricius&quot; and official imperial governor of Italy. At the same time, Zeno received another embassy, sent by Julius Nepos, who asked Zeno to give him the money and the army he needed to resume his control of Italy. Zeno answered that the Roman Senate should welcome back Julius Nepos, their rightful emperor, and that Odoacer should properly receive the patriciate from Nepos, although he allowed that he would also grant it. Odoacer was officially recognised and left in possession of Italy, while Nepos kept his title and the other fragments of the empire&#x27;s western holdings, but no army.

Perhaps in deference to Zeno, Odoacer recognised Nepos&#x27; &quot;de jure&quot; reign in Italy until his death, ruling and even minting coins in his name, but he never allowed his return. After Nepos&#x27; assassination in 480, Odoacer invaded Dalmatia to pursue and punish the assassins (and also to take Dalmatia for himself). Zeno legitimised Odoacer&#x27;s authority in Dalmatia; Odoacer recognised Zeno as sole emperor of the again unitary Empire, but increasingly started using the title of king for himself.

==== Revolt of Marcian (479) ====
Marcian was son of the Western Roman emperor Anthemius (467–472) and maternal grandson of Emperor Marcian (450–457). He had married Ariadne&#x27;s sister Leontia, and was therefore Zeno&#x27;s brother-in-law; he was twice consul, in 467 and 472.

In 479 Marcian tried to overthrow Zeno and claim the throne for himself. With the help of his brothers Procopius Anthemius and Romulus, he gathered in Constantinople troops composed of both citizens and foreigners in the house of a Caesarius, south of the Forum of Theodosius, and from there they marched at the same time on the imperial palace and on the house of Illus, who was a supporter of Zeno. The emperor almost fell into the hands of the rebels, who, during the day, overwhelmed the imperial troops, who were also attacked by citizens from the roofs of their houses. During the night, however, Illus moved an Isaurian unit, quartered in nearby Chalcedonia, into Constantinople and also corrupted Marcian&#x27;s soldiers, who allowed Zeno to flee. The following morning, Marcian, understanding that his situation was desperate and that reinforcements from Theodoric Strabo would not arrive in time, took refuge in the church of the Holy Apostles, but was arrested with his brothers.

Zeno sent Marcian and his brothers to Caesarea in Cappadocia. They tried to flee, but Marcian was captured and obliged to become a monk in Tarsus (Cilicia), or imprisoned in Isauria, in the fortress of Papurius. He tried to escape a second time, and this time he succeeded, but, after gathering new troops and attacking Ancyra, he was defeated and captured by Trocundes, Illus&#x27; brother.

==== Revolt of Illus (484–488) ====

The commanding position and popular favour of Illus rendered him an object of suspicion, and Zeno in various ways sought to rid himself of him. Also Verina, the dowager Empress, plotted against his life. Verina&#x27;s attempt was unsuccessful, and Zeno, equally jealous of her and of Illus, banished her at the suggestion of the latter, confining her in the fort of Papurius. There is some doubt as to the timing of these events. Candidus of Isauria places the banishment of Verina before the revolt of Marcian, and Theodore Lector assigns as the cause of it her share in the revolt of Basiliscus. It is not unlikely, indeed, that this turbulent woman was twice banished, once before Marcian&#x27;s revolt, for her connection with Basiliscus, and again after Marcian&#x27;s revolt, for her plot against Illus.

From her prison she managed to persuade her daughter Ariadne, the wife of Zeno, to attempt to obtain her release, first from Zeno, and then from Illus, to whom the Emperor referred her. Illus refused her request. Ariadne, like her mother, attempted to assassinate Illus. Jordanes ascribes her hatred to another cause: he says that Illus had infused jealous suspicions into Zeno&#x27;s mind which had led Zeno to attempt to end her life, and that her knowledge of these things stimulated her to revenge. The assassin whom she employed only wounded Illus; the assassin was taken prisoner and Zeno, who appears to have been privy to the affair, was unable to prevent his execution.

Illus—with his friend Pamprepius, Leontius and his brother Trocundes—now retired from court. They first went to Nicaea and then, on pretence of change of air and of procuring a cure for his wound, into the East where he was made &quot;magister militum&quot;. Having traversed Asia Minor, they raised the standard of revolt in 484, when Illus declared Leontius Emperor. Zeno sent an army to fight them, but Illus won, obtained possession of Papurius, released Verina, and induced her to crown Leontius at Tarsus.

In 485 Zeno sent against the rebels a fresh army, said to consist of Macedonians and Scythians (Tillemont conjectures, not unreasonably, that these were Ostrogoths) under John the Hunchback, or, more probably, John the Scythian, and Theoderic the Amal, who was at this time consul. John defeated the rebels near Seleucia and drove them into the fort of Papurius where he blockaded them. After a few months Trocundes died; the fort was taken only after four years of siege, by the treachery of Trocundes&#x27;s brother-in-law, who had been sent for the purpose from Constantinople by Zeno. Illus and Leontius were beheaded (488) and their heads sent to the Emperor.

==== Affairs with the Goths (474–487) ====

The aggressions of the two Ostrogothic leaders, Theoderic the Amal (Theoderic the Great), the son of Theodemir and leader of the Moesian Ostrogoths, and Theodoric Strabo, the leader of the Thracian Ostrogoths, had been a constant source of danger since 472. Although Zeno at times contrived to play them off against each other, they in turn were able to profit by his dynastic rivalries. It was only by offering them pay and high command that he kept them from attacking Constantinople itself.

At the death of Leo II, Theodoric Strabo rebelled against Zeno. His support was instrumental in overthrowing Zeno and raising Basiliscus to the Byzantine throne (475), but Theodoric and Basiliscus had a falling-out, so when Zeno returned to Constantinople in 476 and defeated Basiliscus, Strabo was reported to have not defended the city.

In 476/477, Zeno allied himself with Strabo&#x27;s rival, Theoderic the Amal, and ordered him to attack Strabo. The leader of the Thracian Goths sent an embassy to the Emperor, offering peace and blaming the Moesian Theodoric. Zeno understood that this offering was hiding further conspiracies, and convinced the Senate and army to declare Strabo a public enemy.

Zeno&#x27;s plan was to have the two Theoderics attack each other. He sent the Amal against Strabo, who supported the revolt of Marcianus, with the promise of a huge Roman force as reinforcement (478). When Theoderic the Amal arrived through the mountains at Mount Soundis, he did not find the Roman reinforcement army he expected, but instead Theodoric Strabo&#x27;s army, in a strongly fortified camp. The two Theoderics agreed to put forward a joint request to the Emperor, in order to extend to the south the settlement territory of the Ostrogoths in Moesia.

Zeno tried to divide the two Theoderics by bribing the Amal, but he refused the bribe. The Imperial army obtained some initial successes, but Zeno did not press his advantage, and allowed the Amal to move westward in Thrace, plundering territories as he went. With the Amal far away, Strabo accepted an agreement with Zeno: Strabo was to be given back his wealth, money to pay 13,000 soldiers, the command of two &quot;palatinae&quot; units, and the title once more of &quot;magister militum&quot;. However, the army of Theodoric Strabo, 30,000-men strong was still a menace for Zeno, who convinced the Bulgars to attack the Thracian Goths in their own base. Strabo defeated the Bulgars in 480/481, and moved towards Constantinople, but he had to deal with problems with his own men, so he could not capitalise upon his victory and was forced to return to Greece. On his way back, he died in an accident.

After Theodoric Strabo died in 481, the future Theoderic the Great became king of the entire Ostrogoth nation and continued to be a source of trouble in the Balkan peninsula. Zeno allied to Theoderic, whom he appointed &quot;magister militum praesentalis&quot; and even consul for the year 484, the first time a barbarian who was not a citizen of the Empire reached such a high distinction. Zeno had Theoderic fight against Illus and the usurper Leontius, besieging them at Papurius in 484–488. However, in 486 Theoderic revolted again and attacked Constantinople, severing the city&#x27;s water supply. Zeno bought a peace and agreed with Theoderic that the Ostrogoths should have gone to invade Italy to fight Odoacer, who had allegedly supported Leontius, and to establish his new kingdom there (487). This all but eliminated the Germanic presence in the east.

==== Promulgation of the &quot;Henotikon&quot; (482) ====
In religious matters, Zeno is famous for his &quot;Henotikon&quot;, or &quot;Act of Union&quot;, issued in 482 to mediate between Chalcedonian and Miaphysite views about the nature of Christ. The Chalcedonians recognised two natures (&quot;physis&quot;) in Christ, the Miaphysites only one; the Council of Chalcedon (451) had issued the Chalcedonian Creed and condemned the Miaphysite position, but the Miaphysites were still strong, especially in the Eastern provinces of the Empire, and the Patriarch of Alexandria, Peter Mongus, was a Miaphysite. Supporting the Miaphysites was one of the mistakes made by Basiliscus, as the people of Constantinople were Chalcedonian, but Zeno needed the support of the Miaphysite provinces—Egypt, Syria, Palestine and Asia Minor; also, the Patriarch of Constantinople, Acacius, was interested in reducing the distance between the two positions.

Therefore, in 482 Zeno issued the &quot;Henotikon&quot;, a document he had developed with the support of Acacius and addressed to the factions in Egypt. The edict affirmed the Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed (i.e., the Creed of Nicaea completed at Constantinople) as affording a common, final and united symbol or expression of faith. All other symbola or mathemata were excluded; Eutyches and Nestorius were unmistakably condemned in an anathema, while the twelve chapters of Cyril of Alexandria were accepted. The teaching of Chalcedon was not so much repudiated as passed over in silence; Jesus Christ was described as the &quot;only-begotten Son of God [...] one and not two&quot; and there was no explicit reference to the two natures.

The bishop of Rome, Pope Felix III, refused to accept the document and excommunicated Acacius (484), thus beginning the Acacian schism, which lasted until 519.

In 488 the patriarch of Antioch, Peter the Fuller, came to Constantinople to have his right to the Church of Cyprus confirmed. Zeno called the bishop of Cyprus, Anthemius, to answer the accusations. The bishop claimed that before his departure, he had had a vision of St. Barnabas, in which the position of the tomb of the apostle had been revealed to him. In the tomb, Anthemius had found the relics of the apostle and a copy of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot; written in Hebrew by Barnabas himself. Zeno received the relics and the manuscript, and in exchange he proclaimed the autonomy of the Church of Cyprus.

In 489 Zeno closed the Persian school of Edessa in Mesopotamia, by request of bishop Cyrus II of Edessa, because it promoted Nestorian teachings, and built a church in its place. The school relocated to its original home of Nisibis, becoming again the School of Nisibis, and leading to a wave of Nestorian immigration into Persia.

==== Suppressing the Samaritan revolt (484) ====

According to Samaritan sources, Zeno (whom the sources call &quot;Zait the King of Edom&quot;) persecuted the Samaritans. The Emperor went to Sichem (&quot;Neapolis&quot;), gathered the elders and asked them to convert; when they refused, Zeno had many Samaritans killed, and converted the synagogue to a church. Zeno then took for himself Mount Gerizim, where the Samaritans worshipped God, and built several edifices, among which a tomb for his recently deceased son, on which he put a cross, so that the Samaritans, worshipping God, would prostrate in front of the tomb. According to these same sources, Zeno was buried on Mount Gerizim.

Later, in 484, the Samaritans revolted. The rebels attacked Sichem, burnt five churches built on Samaritan holy places and cut off the fingers of bishop Terebinthus, who was officiating the ceremony of Whitsun. They elected Justa (or Justasa/Justasus) as their king and moved to Caesarea, where a significant Samaritan community lived. Here several Christians were killed and the church of St. Sebastian was destroyed. Justa celebrated the victory with games in the circus. According to John Malalas, the &quot;dux Palestinae&quot; Asclepiades, whose troops were reinforced by the Caesarea-based Arcadiani of Rheges, defeated Justa, killed him and sent his head to Zeno. According to Procopius of Caesarea, Terebinthus went to Zeno to ask for revenge; the Emperor personally went to Samaria to quell the rebellion.

Modern historians believe that the order of the facts preserved by Samaritan sources should be inverted, as the persecution of Zeno was a consequence of the rebellion rather than its cause, and should have happened after 484, around 489. Zeno rebuilt the church of St. Procopius in Neapolis (Sichem) and the Samaritans were banned from Mount Gerizim, on whose top a signalling tower was built to alert in case of civil unrest.

=== Death and succession ===
Zeno died on 9 April 491, of dysentery or of epilepsy, after ruling for 17 years and 2 months. No sons were to succeed him: Leo had died in 474, Zenon, the first son, in his youth, while living at court. Ariadne chose a favoured member of the Imperial court, Anastasius, to succeed Zeno. Zeno&#x27;s brother Longinus then revolted, starting the Isaurian War.

The chroniclers George Kedrenos (eleventh century) and Joannes Zonaras (twelfth century) allege that Ariadne had Zeno locked up in a tomb while he was unconscious from drinking or acute illness. She ordered passersby to ignore Zeno&#x27;s cries for help after he awoke; he survived for a time by eating the flesh of his own arms, but eventually perished. This is one of the first historical mentions of the theme of the buried alive devouring their arms or hands. This tale is likely false, as earlier and contemporary sources do not mention it, even though they too were hostile to his memory.

== In popular culture ==

Zeno was a player of τάβλη (tabula), a game nearly identical to modern backgammon. (Τάβλη is still used to refer to backgammon in Greece.) In 480 he had a hand that was so unlucky that he wrote an epigram to record it; Agathias reproduced it half a century later and this allowed the game to be reconstructed in the 19th century. Zeno, who was red, had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two &quot;blots&quot;, checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. As in backgammon, Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent (black) pieces. The red and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno. This is considered by some historians to be the first recorded bad beat story in human history.

Zeno is the protagonist of a theatrical drama in Latin, called &quot;Zeno&quot;, composed c. 1641 by the Jesuit playwright Joseph Simons and performed in 1643 in Rome at the Jesuit English College. An anonymous Greek drama is modelled on this Latin &quot;Zeno&quot;, belonging to the so-called Cretan Theatre. This version was written and performed at Zakynthos in 1682–83 and has Zeno buried alive and his brother Longinus executed.

The play &quot;Romulus the Great&quot; (1950), by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, has Zeno as one of its characters. The plot is loosely based on history; here Zeno flees to Italy and tries to convince Romulus Augustulus to unite their forces and fight together, but his plan fails. Dürrenmatt&#x27;s Zeno is an Emperor oppressed by the Byzantine ceremonial.

<text>In music, timbre (), also known as tone color or tone quality (from psychoacoustics), is the perceived sound quality of a musical note, sound or tone. Timbre distinguishes different types of sound production, such as choir voices and musical instruments. It also enables listeners to distinguish different instruments in the same category (e.g., an oboe and a clarinet, both woodwind instruments).

In simple terms, timbre is what makes a particular musical instrument or human voice have a different sound from another, even when they play or sing the same note. For instance, it is the difference in sound between a guitar and a piano playing the same note at the same volume. Both instruments can sound equally tuned in relation to each other as they play the same note, and while playing at the same amplitude level each instrument will still sound distinctively with its own unique tone color. Experienced musicians are able to distinguish between different instruments of the same type based on their varied timbres, even if those instruments are playing notes at the same fundamental pitch and loudness.

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include frequency spectrum and envelope. Singers and instrumental musicians can change the timbre of the music they are singing/playing by using different singing or playing techniques. For example, a violinist can use different bowing styles or play on different parts of the string to obtain different timbres (e.g., playing sul tasto produces a light, airy timbre, whereas playing sul ponticello produces a harsh, even and aggressive tone). On electric guitar and electric piano, performers can change the timbre using effects units and graphic equalizers.

==Synonyms==
&quot;Tone quality&quot; and &quot;tone color&quot; are synonyms for &quot;timbre&quot;, as well as the &quot;&quot;texture&quot; attributed to a single instrument&quot;. However, the word texture can also refer to the type of music, such as multiple, interweaving melody lines versus a singable melody accompanied by subordinate chords. Hermann von Helmholtz used the German &quot;Klangfarbe&quot; (&quot;tone color&quot;), and John Tyndall proposed an English translation, &quot;clangtint&quot;, but both terms were disapproved of by Alexander Ellis, who also discredits &quot;register&quot; and &quot;color&quot; for their pre-existing English meanings. Determined by its frequency composition, the sound of a musical instrument may be described with words such as &quot;bright&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;warm&quot;, &quot;harsh&quot;, and other terms. There are also colors of noise, such as pink and white. In visual representations of sound, timbre corresponds to the shape of the image, while loudness corresponds to brightness; pitch corresponds to the y-shift of the spectrogram.

==ASA definition==
The Acoustical Society of America (ASA) Acoustical Terminology definition 12.09 of timbre describes it as &quot;that attribute of auditory sensation which enables a listener to judge that two nonidentical sounds, similarly presented and having the same loudness and pitch, are dissimilar&quot;, adding, &quot;Timbre depends primarily upon the frequency spectrum, although it also depends upon the sound pressure and the temporal characteristics of the sound&quot;.

==Attributes==
Many commentators have attempted to decompose timbre into component attributes. For example, J. F. Schouten (1968, 42) describes the &quot;elusive attributes of timbre&quot; as &quot;determined by at least five major acoustic parameters&quot;, which Robert Erickson finds, &quot;scaled to the concerns of much contemporary music&quot;:

# Range between tonal and noiselike character
# Spectral envelope
# Time envelope in terms of rise, duration, and decay (ADSR, which stands for &quot;attack, decay, sustain, release&quot;)
# Changes both of spectral envelope (formant-glide) and fundamental frequency (micro-intonation)
# Prefix, or onset of a sound, quite dissimilar to the ensuing lasting vibration

An example of a tonal sound is a musical sound that has a definite pitch, such as pressing a key on a piano; a sound with a noiselike character would be white noise, the sound similar to that produced when a radio is not tuned to a station.

Erickson gives a table of subjective experiences and related physical phenomena based on Schouten&#x27;s five attributes:

See also Psychoacoustic evidence below.

===Harmonics===

The richness of a sound or note a musical instrument produces is sometimes described in terms of a sum of a number of distinct frequencies. The lowest frequency is called the &quot;fundamental frequency&quot;, and the pitch it produces is used to name the note, but the fundamental frequency is not always the dominant frequency. The dominant frequency is the frequency that is most heard, and it is always a multiple of the fundamental frequency. For example, the dominant frequency for the transverse flute is double the fundamental frequency. Other significant frequencies are called overtones of the fundamental frequency, which may include harmonics and partials. Harmonics are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency, such as ×2, ×3, ×4, etc. Partials are other overtones. There are also sometimes subharmonics at whole number &quot;divisions&quot; of the fundamental frequency. Most instruments produce harmonic sounds, but many instruments produce partials and inharmonic tones, such as cymbals and other indefinite-pitched instruments.

When the tuning note in an orchestra or concert band is played, the sound is a combination of 440 Hz, 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, 1760 Hz and so on. Each instrument in the orchestra or concert band produces a different combination of these frequencies, as well as harmonics and overtones. The sound waves of the different frequencies overlap and combine, and the balance of these amplitudes is a major factor in the characteristic sound of each instrument.

William Sethares wrote that just intonation and the western equal tempered scale are related to the harmonic spectra/timbre of many western instruments in an analogous way that the inharmonic timbre of the Thai renat (a xylophone-like instrument) is related to the seven-tone near-equal tempered pelog scale in which they are tuned. Similarly, the inharmonic spectra of Balinese metallophones combined with harmonic instruments such as the stringed rebab or the voice, are related to the five-note near-equal tempered slendro scale commonly found in Indonesian gamelan music.

===Envelope===

The timbre of a sound is also greatly affected by the following aspects of its &quot;envelope&quot;: attack time and characteristics, decay, sustain, release (ADSR envelope) and transients. Thus these are all common controls on professional synthesizers. For instance, if one takes away the attack from the sound of a piano or trumpet, it becomes more difficult to identify the sound correctly, since the sound of the hammer hitting the strings or the first blast of the player&#x27;s lips on the trumpet mouthpiece are highly characteristic of those instruments. The envelope is the overall amplitude structure of a sound.

==In music history==
Instrumental timbre played an increasing role in the practice of orchestration during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Berlioz and Wagner made significant contributions to its development during the nineteenth century. For example, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Sleep motif&quot; from Act 3 of his opera &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, features a descending chromatic scale that passes through a gamut of orchestral timbres. First the woodwind (flute, followed by oboe), then the massed sound of strings with the violins carrying the melody, and finally the brass (French horns).Debussy, who composed during the last decades of the nineteenth and the first decades of the twentieth centuries, has been credited with elevating further the role of timbre: &quot;To a marked degree the music of Debussy elevates timbre to an unprecedented structural status; already in &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; the &quot;color&quot; of flute and harp functions referentially&quot;. Mahler&#x27;s approach to orchestration illustrates the increasing role of differentiated timbres in music of the early twentieth century. Norman Del Mar describes the following passage from the Scherzo movement of his Sixth Symphony, as
: &quot;a seven-bar link to the trio consisting of an extension in diminuendo of the repeated As ... though now rising in a succession of piled octaves which moreover leap-frog with Cs added to the As. The lower octaves then drop away and only the Cs remain so as to dovetail with the first oboe phrase of the trio.&quot;

During these bars, Mahler passes the repeated notes through a gamut of instrumental colors, mixed and single: starting with horns and pizzicato strings, progressing through trumpet, clarinet, flute, piccolo and finally, oboe: (See also .)

In rock music from the late 1960s to the 2000s, the timbre of specific sounds is important to a song. For example, in heavy metal music, the sonic impact of the heavily amplified, heavily distorted power chord played on electric guitar through very loud guitar amplifiers and rows of speaker cabinets is an essential part of the style&#x27;s musical identity.

==Psychoacoustic evidence==
Often, listeners can identify an instrument, even at different pitches and loudness, in different environments, and with different players. In the case of the clarinet, acoustic analysis shows waveforms irregular enough to suggest three instruments rather than one. David Luce suggests that this implies that
: &quot;[C]ertain strong regularities in the acoustic waveform of the above instruments must exist which are invariant with respect to the above variables&quot;.

However, Robert Erickson argues that there are few regularities and they do not explain our &quot;...powers of recognition and identification.&quot; He suggests borrowing the concept of subjective constancy from studies of vision and visual perception.

Psychoacoustic experiments from the 1960s onwards tried to elucidate the nature of timbre. One method involves playing pairs of sounds to listeners, then using a multidimensional scaling algorithm to aggregate their dissimilarity judgments into a timbre space. The most consistent outcomes from such experiments are that brightness or spectral energy distribution, and the &quot;bite&quot;, or rate and synchronicity and rise time, of the attack are important factors.

==Tristimulus timbre model==
The concept of tristimulus originates in the world of color, describing the way three primary colors can be mixed together to create a given color. By analogy, the musical tristimulus measures the mixture of harmonics in a given sound, grouped into three sections. It is basically a proposal of reducing a huge number of sound partials, which can amount to dozens or hundreds in some cases, down to only three values. The first tristimulus measures the relative weight of the first harmonic; the second tristimulus measures the relative weight of the second, third, and fourth harmonics taken together; and the third tristimulus measures the relative weight of all the remaining harmonics:
: formula_1
However, more evidence, studies and applications would be needed regarding this type of representation, in order to validate it.

==Brightness==
The term &quot;brightness&quot; is also used in discussions of sound timbres, in a rough analogy with visual brightness. Timbre researchers consider brightness to be one of the perceptually strongest distinctions between sounds and formalize it acoustically as an indication of the amount of high-frequency content in a sound, using a measure such as the spectral centroid.

<doc id="77893" wikidata="Q4750000" url="?curid=77893" title="An Eye for an Eye (Sack book)">
<text>An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945 is a 1993 book by John Sack, in which Sack states that some Jews in Eastern Europe, Czech Republic, and Poland took revenge on their former captors while overseeing over 1,000 concentration camps in Poland for German civilians. Sack provides details of the imprisonment of 200,000 Germans &quot;many of them starved, beaten and tortured&quot; and estimates that &quot;more than 60,000 died at the hands of a largely Jewish-run security organisation.&quot;

==Discourse==
A professor of Jewish history at Brandeis University, Antony Polonsky, said that his &quot;research appears to be sound&quot;, but he and other reviewers have questioned the &quot;extent of Jewish persecution of Germans&quot;, in Sack&#x27;s book.

Polish historians including Tadeusz Wolsza from the Polish Academy of Sciences and Krzysztof Szwagrzyk from the Institute of National Remembrance inform that in 1945–1950 there were between 206 and 500 internment camps set up mostly by the Soviet NKVD at the former Nazi slave-labor camps in Greater Poland and across Silesia, but the numbers reaching or ever exceeding 1,000 have no grounds in reality.

According to Holocaust writer Daniel Goldhagen&#x27;s review of the book in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, most of the people working in these camps were not Jewish and Goldhagen argued Sack did his best to conceal this. Goldhagen cited a November 1945 report that only 1.7% of the members of the Office of State Security were Jews as refutation of Sack&#x27;s figure of 75%. Sack responded that he had stated his figure for officers in Kattowitz in February, not all members in November, and that he had also written that hundreds of Jews left OSS during the year. Sack said that he attempted to publish a response in a letter to the editor of &quot;The New Republic&quot; but the magazine refused it. Sack said that &quot;The New Republic&quot; agreed to publish his reply as an advertisement, but later reversed its position.

Sack has responded to American critics of the book who say that it is &quot;sensational and its charges inadequately attributed to source&quot; by replying that his extensive research left little doubt that Jews ran the Świętochłowice &quot;Zgoda&quot; camp &quot;from the bottom to the top&quot;. He added &quot;It pains me as a Jew to report this&quot;.

Sack expressed surprise at criticisms denying the accuracy of his claims, asserting that the main points have been repeatedly confirmed by others, the TV programme &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; among them.

In 1995, the German publisher Piper Verlag pulled the book after printing it, apparently in response to a review by journalist Eike Geisel that called it &quot;antisemitic fodder&quot;. According to Sack, Geisel claimed to quote a passage that doesn&#x27;t exist in the book. It was published by another German publisher instead.

<text>China Central Television (CCTV) is the national television broadcaster of China, established in 1958. CCTV is operated by the National Radio and Television Administration which reports directly to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)&#x27;s Central Propaganda Department.

CCTV has a variety of functions, such as news communication, social education, culture, and entertainment information services. It is a key player in the Chinese government&#x27;s propaganda network. According to Freedom House and other media commentators, CCTV&#x27;s reporting about topics sensitive to the Chinese government and CCP is distorted and often used as a weapon against the party&#x27;s perceived enemies.

==History==
In 1954, CCP chairman Mao Zedong put forward that China should establish its own TV station. On 5 February 1955, the central broadcasting bureau reported to the State Council and proposed the program of establishing a medium-sized television station, later on premier Zhou Enlai included in China&#x27;s first five-year plan the planned introduction of television broadcasts. In December 1957, the central broadcasting bureau sent Luo Donghe and Meng Qiyu to the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic for the inspection of their TV stations (see Television in the Soviet Union and Deutscher Fernsehfunk), then the duo returned to Beijing to prepare for the establishment of the TV station. Said station officially signed on for the first time as Beijing Television on 1 May 1958.

In time for its 20th birthday, Beijing Television was formally renamed China Central Television on 1 May 1978, and a new logo was unveiled.

Until the late 1970s, CCTV held only evening broadcasts, usually closing down at midnight. During the summer and winter academic vacations, it occasionally transmitted daytime programming for students, while special daytime programs were aired during national holidays. 

In 1980, CCTV experimented with news relays from local and central television studios via microwave. It also had its first international collaboration that year, production of the documentary series &quot;Silk Road&quot; with Japan&#x27;s public broadcasting company, NHK. In 1984, CCTV established the wholly-owned subsidiary (CITVC).

By 1985, CCTV had already become a leading television network in China. In 1987, CCTV&#x27;s grew due to the adaptation and presentation of &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber,&quot; the first Chinese television drama to enter the global market. In the same year, CCTV exported 10,216 shows to 77 foreign television stations.

Initially, the CCP&#x27;s Central Propaganda Department issued directive censorship of programs. During reform in the 1990s, it adopted new standards for CCTV, &quot;affordability&quot; and &quot;acceptability&quot;, loosening the previous government control. Affordability refers to purchasing ability of programs, while acceptability requires that a program has acceptable content, preventing the broadcast of material that contains inappropriate content or expresses views against the CCP.

In March 2018, as the nation began marking the 60th year of television, CCTV ownership changed hands to a new state holding group, the China Media Group.

=== Overseas broadcasting ===
In 1990, CCTV subsidiary, CITVC, established China Television Corporation in California to distribute CCTV content in the U.S. In 2000, CCTV&#x27;s all-English channel, known as CCTV-9 or CCTV International, was launched.

In 2001, the Great Foreign Propaganda Plan was launched by Xu Guangchun, the head of SARFT, also the deputy head of the CCP&#x27;s Central Propaganda Department after the urgency of bringing the voice of China to the world was presented by Jiang Zemin, former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. The idea of an English channel was brought out in 1996. CCTV-4 had three half-hour English news broadcasting every day, but later, on 25 September 2000, CCTV-9 a satellite channel was set up to be the first 24-hour English channel, aimed to establish the overseas market. In October 2001, CCTV partnered with AOL Time Warner and other foreign news corporations, giving them access to the Chinese media market in exchange for cable delivery in the US and Europe, mainly delivering CCTV-9 programs.

The CCTV-4 channel split into three separate channels on 1 April 2007—each serving different time zones: China Standard Time (CST), Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and Eastern Standard Time (EST)—in order to improve service for audiences around the world.

On 25 July 2009, CCTV launched its Arabic-language international channel, stating that it aims to maintain stronger links with Arab nations.

In 2015 and 2018, CCTV signed cooperation agreements with Russian state media outlet RT.

In December 2016, CCTV&#x27;s foreign language services were spun off into China Global Television Network (CGTN).

CCTV and Uzbekistan&#x27;s National Television and Radio Corporation (UzTRK) cooperate to produce joint programs and documentaries.

==== China Network Television ====
China Network Television (CNTV) was an internet-based broadcaster of China Central Television which launched on 28 December 2009.

==Organization==
China Central Television, as a component of the China Media Group (CMG), falls under the supervision of the National Radio and Television Administration which is in turn subordinate to the CCP&#x27;s Central Propaganda Department. The organization is considered one of the &quot;big three&quot; state media outlets in China, along with the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and Xinhua News Agency.

===Management===
The current president of CCTV is Shen Haixiong, who was appointed in February 2018, and also appointed as a deputy head of the CCP&#x27;s Central Propaganda Department.

==Programs==
CCTV produces its own news broadcasts three times a day and is the country&#x27;s most powerful and prolific television program producer. Its thirty-minute evening news, &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; (&quot;CCTV Network News&quot; or &quot;CCTV Tonight&quot;, ), goes on air daily at 7:00 pm Beijing time. All local stations are required to carry CCTV&#x27;s news broadcast. An internal CCTV survey indicates that nearly 500 million people countrywide regularly watch this program.

&quot;Focus Report&quot; (&quot;jiaodian fangtan&quot;), first introduced in 1994, was a popular CCTV show which regularly exposes the wrongdoings of local officials, which attracts serious attention from higher levels of government. It also exposed the Chinese government&#x27;s response to charges of corruption. In 1998, Premier Zhu Rongji praised the program as an important tool of media supervision (&quot;yulun jiandu&quot;).

The &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot; ()—a yearly special program for the Chinese New Year—is the most-watched CCTV show.

In 2003, CCTV launched its first 24-hour news channel, initially available to cable viewers.

=== Channels ===
=== Audience share ===

, China&#x27;s television audience rose to 1.2 billion. As content becomes more diversified, there have been concerns about the audience share, as CCTV is losing out to cable, satellite and regional networks. In Guangzhou for example, CCTV programming only accounts for 45% of the weekly audience share, while in Shanghai, local stations also have share over CCTV. However, the &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot; remains extremely popular; it acquires more than 90% audience share over the nation.

=== Personalities ===

Producing a variety of different programming, China Central Television has a number of different program hosts, news anchors, correspondents, and contributors who appear throughout daily programing on the network.

== Reception ==
The network&#x27;s principal directors and other officers are appointed by the State, and so are the top officials at local conventional television stations in mainland China; nearly all of them are restricted to broadcasting within their own province or municipality. Editorial independence is subject to government policy considerations, and as a result, its history and news channels have been charged with being &quot;propaganda aimed at brainwashing the audience&quot; in a letter written by a number of Chinese intellectuals who also called for a boycott of state media was posted on a US-based website and has circulated through Chinese websites. The network often publishes misleading and false information, particularly as it pertains to issues considered sensitive by the Chinese government. However, only a small percentage of the Network&#x27;s programming can be described as &quot;abusive or demonizing propaganda.&quot;

Journalists working for the network&#x27;s English-language international channel, CGTN, as well as of the other non-Chinese language TV channels under the CGTN banner, are under constant pressure to present a positive account of China, according to Anne-Marie Brady&#x27;s study published in 2008. &quot;In August 2005, a series of items reported factually on the coal mining disaster in China; soon after the channel&#x27;s leaders received a warning from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that its reports were harming China&#x27;s international image. Following this incident, senior editorial staff and journalists were all forced to write self-criticisms.&quot;

Brady says that while the channel&#x27;s equipment is state-of-the-art, the employees are not well trained in how to use it, so there are frequent errors during a broadcast. &quot;The political controls on the station contribute to a generally low level of morale and initiative among station staff,&quot; she writes.

A study done by the observer of Chinese film and television, Ying Zhu, suggests that &quot;CCTV is full of serious-minded creators who regularly experience bouts of self-doubt, philosophical ambivalence, and in some cases, clinical depression.&quot; During her extensive interviews with key CCTV players, Zhu notes that &quot;Certain common themes, about ideals, distorted or altogether thwarted by commercial and political pressure, emerged.&quot;

According to Freedom House, CCTV &quot;has a consistent record of blatantly and egregiously violating journalistic standards and encouraging or justifying hatred and violence against innocent people. CCTV is an essential component of the CCP&#x27;s brutal authoritarian regime and should be treated as such.&quot;

In 2020, the United States Department of State designated CCTV as a foreign mission, which requires it to disclose more about its operations in the U.S.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of CCTV, the China Media Group, to be &quot;State Controlled Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

=== Incidents ===
Since its inception CCTV has served as a tool of state power and as such has been complicit in human rights abuses. They have a history of demonizing and inciting hatred against those perceived as foes by the CCP, in this way they can be used to mobilize against threats as diverse as Falun Gong and international human rights groups.

==== 1990s Falun Gong crackdown ====
In 1999, during the first crackdown on Falun Gong, CCTV&#x27;s &quot;Focus Talk&quot; ran 28 episodes over a 32-day period which defamed practitioners and incited hatred against them. In 2001, they deceptively claimed that a group of people who had set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square were Falun Gong adherents, a claim which was characterized as &quot;clearly abusive&quot; by the Canadian regulatory commission.

==== Xinwen Lianbo and fake imagery ====
On 23 January 2011, Xinwen Lianbo showcased the Chengdu J-10 firing a missile at a plane, causing it to explode. The footage lasted half a second and the destroyed plane shown was later identified as that of an F-5E, a US fighter jet. The clip was later revealed to have been taken from the 1986 US movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;.

==== Comments by CCTV head Hu Zhanfan ====
In 2011, the new CCTV head Hu Zhanfan &quot;was found to have proclaimed in July [or January, both before the CCTV appointment in November] that journalists&#x27; foremost responsibility is to &#x27;be a good mouthpiece Internet posts of the comment blossomed after the appointment, one &quot;juxtapos[ing] CCTV&#x27;s ... &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; (新闻联播) and photos of Chinese crowds waving red flags with black-and-white images from Nazi-era Germany&quot;. Comparisons with the Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels also spread. Official media coverage of the Zhanfan&#x27;s presentation focused on his call to avoid &quot;fake news and false reports (失实报道)&quot; but also incorporated the &quot;mouthpiece&quot; comment.

==== Broadcasting forced confessions ====
CCTV regularly broadcasts the forced confessions of accused or convicted criminals and produces programming to go along with them. These programs are often filmed before the beginning of formal judicial procedures. Domestic dissidents such as lawyers, journalists, and activists as well as foreigners have been the victim of this practice.

In 2013, Peter Humphrey and Charles Xue&#x27;s forced confessions were aired on CCTV. Since being freed, Humphrey has been highly critical of CCTV and the practice of airing forced confessions. In 2020, the British media regulator Ofcom sided with Humphrey and announced sanctions against CGTN, which aired Humphrey&#x27;s confession and was branded as CCTV News at the time.

In 2014, CCTV broadcast the forced confession of the then-septuagenarian journalist Gao Yu.

In 2016, Peter Dahlin and Gui Minhai&#x27;s forced confessions were aired on CCTV. In 2019 Dahlin filed a complaint against China Global Television Network (CGTN) and China Central Television-4 (CCTV-4) with Canadian authorities.

On 21 November 2019, CCTV&#x27;s international arm CGTN aired a video of a forced confession from Hong Kong activist Simon Cheng. Within a week, Cheng had filed a new complaint to Ofcom over the broadcast.

In 2020, the forced confession of Taiwanese citizen Lee Meng-chu was aired on a CCTV program. A day later, the same program aired the forced confession of an academic from Taiwan accused of espionage and separatist activities.

==== 2009 fire ====

On 9 February 2009, the Beijing Television Cultural Center caught fire on the last day of the festivities of Chinese New Year, killing one firefighter. The blaze rendered the 42-story structure unusable, as the zinc and titanium alloy of the outer skin was burnt.

The fire had implications for the credibility of CCTV, which was already unpopular because of its dominance in the media. The incident was mocked by netizens who reproduced photoshopped photos of the fire and criticized CCTV for censoring coverage. Pictures of the fire are widely distributed on the internet, as a result of citizen journalism.

==== Libyan Civil War ====
During the 2011 military intervention in Libya, reports from CCTV tended to support Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s arguments, claiming that the coalition forces attacked Libyan civilians and the military intervention was no different from an invasion. In some of the news reports, CCTV used images of demonstrators and said that they were against NATO&#x27;s military intervention. CCTV also mislabeled a person holding a banner which said &quot;Vive la France&quot; (&quot;long live France&quot; in French) and claimed that he was a supporter of Gaddafi. Later on 27 March, a Chinese banner that said &quot;Muammar Gaddafi is a lier. &quot; was shown in some Libyan demonstration videos on the Internet.

==== 2019 NBA free speech dispute ====
In 2019, CCTV announced that they were cancelling the broadcast of two National Basketball Association preseason games in response to a tweet by the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. After Adam Silver defended the General Manager&#x27;s right to free speech, CCTV responded with, &quot;We express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Silver&#x27;s stated support of Morey&#x27;s right to free speech. We believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability do not belong to the category of free speech,&quot; and continued, &quot;We will also immediately examine all other cooperation and exchanges with the NBA.&quot;

==== Censorship and disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
During the 2022 Winter Paralympics, CCTV censored a speech by International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine. CCTV promoted Russian disinformation such as unsubstantiated claims of biological weapons labs in Ukraine. In April 2022, CCTV repeated Russian claims that the Bucha massacre was staged.

==== Censorship during the 2022 COVID-19 protests ====

During the 2022 COVID-19 protests in China, CCTV&#x27;s coverage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup censored scenes of maskless fans in the stadium. CCTV avoided coverage of the protests directly.

==== Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant ====
In 2023, CCTV ran paid ads on social media platforms in multiple countries and languages denouncing the discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, which critics labeled part of a concerted disinformation campaign.

<text>The indri (; Indri indri), also called the babakoto, is one of the largest living lemurs, with a head-body length of about and a weight of between . It has a black and white coat and maintains an upright posture when climbing or clinging. It is monogamous and lives in small family groups, moving through the canopy, and is herbivorous, feeding mainly on leaves but also seeds, fruits, and flowers. The groups are quite vocal, communicating with other groups by singing, roaring and other vocalisations. Besides humans, it is the only mammal found that can use rhythm.

It is a diurnal tree-dweller related to the sifakas and, like all lemurs, it is native to Madagascar. It is revered by the Malagasy people and plays an important part in their myths and legends with various stories in existence accounting for its origin. The main threats faced by the indri are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to slash and burn agriculture, fuelwood gathering, and logging. It is also hunted despite taboos against this. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as &quot;critically endangered&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;indri&quot; most likely comes from a native Malagasy name for the animal, &quot;endrina&quot;. An oft-repeated, but incorrect story is that the name comes from &quot;indry&quot; , meaning &quot;there&quot; or &quot;there it is&quot;.
French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat, who first described the animal, supposedly heard a Malagasy point out the animal and took the word to be its name. It has been suggested that he may have heard the local name &quot;endrina&quot; which is used. Another Malagasy name for the animal is &quot;&quot; . &quot;Babakoto&quot; is most commonly translated as &quot;ancestor&quot; or &quot;father&quot;, but several translations are possible. &quot;Koto&quot; is a Malagasy word for &quot;little boy&quot; and &quot;Rakoto&quot; is a common name, with &quot;Koto&quot; as its diminutive. As &quot;baba&quot; is a term for &quot;father,&quot; the word &quot;babakoto&quot; may be translated as &quot;father of a little boy&quot; or &quot;father of Rakoto.&quot; The father-son dynamic of many of the babakoto origin myths helps to explain the Malagasy name.

== Physical characteristics ==

Along with the diademed sifaka, the indri is the largest lemur still in existence; both have average weights of about 6.5 kg. It can weigh up to to and perhaps up to . It has a head-body length of and can reach nearly with legs fully extended.

The indri is a vertical clinger and leaper and thus holds its body upright when traveling through trees or resting in branches. It has long, muscular legs which it uses to propel itself from trunk to trunk. Its large greenish eyes and black face are framed by round, fuzzy ears. Unlike any other living lemur, the indri has only a rudimentary tail. The silky fur is mostly black with white patches along the limbs, neck, crown, and lower back. Different populations of the species show wide variations in color, with some northern populations consisting of mostly or entirely black individuals. The face is bare with pale black skin, and it is sometimes fringed with white fur.

Due to these color variations, Colin Groves listed two subspecies of the indri in 2005: The dark &quot;Indri indri indri&quot; from the northern part of its range and the relatively pale &quot;Indri indri variegatus&quot; from the southern part. Later editions of &quot;Lemurs of Madagascar&quot; by Russell Mittermeier &quot;et al.&quot; do not recognize this classification, and recent genetic and morphological work suggests the variation in the indri is clinal.
== Behavior ==

The indri practices long-term monogamy, seeking a new partner only after the death of a mate. It lives in small groups consisting of the mated male and female and their maturing offspring. In the more fragmented forests of their range, the indri may live in larger groups with several generations. Habitat fragmentation limits the mobility and capacity of these large groups to break into smaller units.

Like many other species of lemur, indri live in a female dominant society. The dominant female often will displace males to lower branches and poorer feeding grounds, and is typically the one to lead the group during travel.

It is common for groups to move 300–700 m daily, with most distance travelled midsummer in search of fruit. Indris sleep in trees about 10–30 m above ground and typically sleep alone or in pairs. It is common for young female indris, occasionally adult females, to silently play wrestle anywhere from a few seconds up to 15 minutes. Members of a single group will urinate and defecate jointly at one of their many selected areas of defecation in their territory.

=== Reproduction ===
Indris reach sexual maturity between the ages of 7 and 9. Females bear offspring every two to three years, with a gestation period around 120–150 days. The single infant is usually born in May or June. The mother is the primary caregiver, though the father assists, remaining with his mate and offspring. Infants are born mostly or completely black and begin to show white coloration (if any) between four and six months of age. The infant clings to its mother&#x27;s belly until it is four or five months old, at which time it is ready to move onto her back. The indri begins to demonstrate independence at eight months, but it will not be fully independent from its mother until it is at least two years old.

=== Communication ===
The indri makes loud, distinctive songs, which can last from 45 seconds to more than 3 minutes. Song duration and structure varies among and even within groups, but most songs have the following three-phase pattern.

Usually, a roaring sequence lasting for several seconds will precede the more characteristic vocalizations. All members of the group except the very young participate in this roar, but the song proper is dominated by the adult pair. They follow the roar with a long note sequence, characterized by notes of up to five seconds in duration. After this is a descending phrase sequence. The wails begin on a high note and become progressively lower-pitched. It is common for two or more indri to coordinate the timing of their descending notes to form a duet.

Different indri groups typically sing sequentially, responding to one another. As well as solidifying contacts between groups, the songs may communicate territorial defense and boundaries, environmental conditions, reproductive potential of the group members, and warning signals. The indri may sing after disturbances such as thunder, airplanes, bird calls, and other lemur calls. A group will sing almost every day, up to seven times daily. The peak singing hours are between 7 and 11 am. Daily frequency of song is highest during the indri&#x27;s breeding season from December to March.

Several other indri vocalizations have been identified. The &quot;roar&quot; is also used as a warning signal for aerial predators such as hawks. The indri emit a &quot;hoot&quot; or &quot;honk&quot; to warn of terrestrial predators such as the fossa. Other vocal categories include the &quot;grunt&quot;, &quot;kiss&quot;, &quot;wheeze&quot;, and &quot;hum&quot;. The purpose of these is not well understood.

Before singing, the indri move to the tree tops, which allows them to be heard up to 4 km away.

===Diet and feeding===

The indri is herbivorous and primarily folivorous. It prefers young, tender leaves, but will also eat seeds, fruits, and flowers. Female indri seem to have greater preference for immature leaves than males do and spend more time foraging among them. A wide variety of plant species are consumed, with members of the laurel family featuring prominently in the diet. The indri consumes little nontree vegetation.

To feed, the indri plucks off a leaf or other plant part with its teeth. It uses its hands to pull tree branches closer to its mouth.

Reproductively mature females have priority access to food sources, therefore they forage higher in the trees than males.

== Distribution ==

This lemur inhabits the lowland and montane forests along the eastern coast of Madagascar, from the Réserve Spéciale d’Anjanaharibe-Sud in the north to the Mangoro River in the south. They are absent from the Masoala Peninsula and the Marojejy National Park, even though both regions are connected to forests where indri do occur less than 40 km away.

==Relationship with humans==

===Mythology===

Across Madagascar, the indri is revered and protected by &quot;fady&quot; (taboos). Countless variations are given on the legend of the indri&#x27;s origins, but they all treat it as a sacred animal, not to be hunted or harmed.

A legend tells of a man who went hunting in the forest and did not return. His absence worried his son, who went out looking for him. When the son also disappeared, the rest of the villagers ventured into the forest seeking the two, but discovered only two large lemurs sitting in the trees: the first indri. The boy and his father had transformed. In some versions, only the son transforms, and the wailing of the babakoto is analogous to the father&#x27;s wailing for his lost son.

Another human-like characteristic of the indri is its behavior in the sun. Like its sifaka relatives, the indri frequently engages in what has been described as sun-bathing or sun-worshipping. As the sun rises each morning, it will sit and face it from a tree branch with its legs crossed, back straight, hands low with palms facing out or resting on its knees, and eyes half-closed. Biologists are hesitant to call this behavior sun worship, as the term may be overly anthropomorphic. However, many Malagasy people do believe that the indri worships the sun.

===Conservation===

The first film of indri was obtained using tape lures, on an expedition forming the basis of David Attenborough&#x27;s 1961 BBC series &quot;Zoo Quest to Madagascar&quot;.

The indri is a critically endangered species. While population estimates are uncertain (1,000 – 10 000 individuals), the population appears to be rapidly shrinking and may diminish by 80% over the next three generations (~36 years). The primary threats to its existence are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to slash and burn agriculture, fuelwood gathering, and logging. This kind of destruction occurs even in protected areas.

The indri is also widely hunted, despite the many origin myths and traditional taboos (&quot;fady&quot;) that hold it sacred. Cultural erosion and immigration are partly to blame for the breakdown of traditional beliefs. In some cases, Malagasy people who resent the protective &quot;fady&quot; find ways to circumvent them. People whose &quot;fady&quot; forbid them from eating the indri may still hunt the lemurs and sell their flesh, and those forbidden to kill the indri may still purchase and consume them. Indri meat is prized as a delicacy in some regions.

Only one indri has lived over a year in captivity and none have bred successfully while captive.

<doc id="77896" wikidata="Q558689" url="?curid=77896" title="Míchel (footballer, born 1963)">
<text>José Miguel González Martín del Campo, known as Míchel (; born 23 March 1963), is a Spanish former professional footballer who played as a right midfielder, currently manager of Saudi Pro League club Al-Qadsiah.

He was most noted for his stellar crossing ability, also contributing with a fair share of goals. During his career he represented mainly Real Madrid – over a decade – achieving team and individual success.

Míchel earned 66 caps for Spain from 1985 to 1992, and appeared for the nation in two World Cups (scoring four goals in the 1990 edition) and Euro 1988. He started working as a manager in 2005, notably leading Olympiacos to two Super League Greece accolades.

==Playing career==
===Club===
The son of a footballer who had to retire from the game at 27 after a road accident, Míchel was born in Madrid and joined Real Madrid at the age of 13, his technique and physicality on the pitch quickly standing out. He moved quickly through the ranks to the first team, appearing – and scoring – once in the 1981–82 season, through a penalty in a 2–1 away win over CD Castellón on 11 April 1982.

A member of the renowned &quot;La Quinta del Buitre&quot;, which also featured Emilio Butragueño, Miguel Pardeza, Rafael Martín Vázquez and Manolo Sanchís, Míchel never played less than 31 La Liga matches from 1985 to 1994. After helping Castilla CF to the Segunda División title in 1984, he was instrumental in the capital club&#x27;s conquests, which included six leagues and two consecutive UEFA Cups; he opened the score in the 1985 final of the latter competition, against Videoton FC.

In 1989, Míchel announced he would leave Real Madrid after having signed with an Italian side, but this never came to pass and he ended up staying until 1996. In his penultimate season, he suffered a severe knee injury which rendered him unavailable for several months, but still bounced back for a final solid year, after which he left for Atlético Celaya in Mexico – where Butragueño was also playing – shortly after the arrival at Madrid of president Lorenzo Sanz. He retired from football in 1997.

Míchel&#x27;s career was not without incident: in 1988, he was hit by a bottle while on the pitch and, three years later, he was sanctioned by UEFA for using an unorthodox method of disrupting the concentration of Carlos Valderrama, in a game against Real Valladolid. The presiding judge in the case noted that &quot;manipulating in public that of your neighbour which is a gift given exclusively to males by nature&quot; violated a federation rule protecting a player&#x27;s dignity.

===International===
Míchel made his debut for the Spain national team on 20 November 1985 against Austria, going on to appear in a further 65 internationals and score 21 goals (only missed a callup due to injury). He played in the 1986 and the 1990 FIFA World Cups, netting a hat-trick against South Korea in Spain&#x27;s second fixture during the latter tournament (3–1, famously shouting &quot;I&#x27;ve earned this&quot; after his last goal) and also a penalty against Belgium in the country&#x27;s final group match.

Shortly after Javier Clemente&#x27;s arrival as national boss, Míchel was deemed surplus to requirements and never called again, although only 29. All national categories comprised, he received exactly 100 caps.

==Coaching career==
In the summer of 2005, after working as a sports commentator with RTVE after his retirement (still active, he had already worked in the capacity at the 1994 World Cup) and also writing articles for Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Marca&quot;, Míchel was appointed manager of Rayo Vallecano. The following year he returned to his &quot;alma mater&quot; as director of Real Madrid&#x27;s sports city, the entire youth system, and manager duties at Real Madrid Castilla, where he coached one of his sons, Adrián; under his management the side dropped down a level into Segunda División B and he was sacked, also leaving his post in the youth sides due to disagreements with president Ramón Calderón.

On 27 April 2009, Míchel was appointed as coach of top-flight strugglers Getafe CF until the end of the season. He replaced former FC Barcelona midfielder Víctor Muñoz, and also managed Adrián, helping the club avoid relegation in the last matchday and renewing his contract for two more years the following week. He was relieved of his duties at the end of 2010–11, with the team again managing to stay afloat after finishing 16th, just one point clear of the relegation zone.

Míchel joined Sevilla FC on 6 February 2012, replacing fired Marcelino García Toral and signing until the end of the season. On 14 January of the following year, after a 2–0 away loss to Valencia CF that left the Andalusians in 12th place, he was relieved of his duties.

Míchel moved to Olympiacos F.C. in the Super League Greece on 1 February 2013, penning a contract until June 2015. In his first 18 months in charge, he won two national championships and the 2013 Greek Cup. He was fired on 6 January 2015, whilst the side was still competing in the Europa League and only a point behind PAOK FC in the domestic campaign.

On 19 August 2015, Míchel succeeded Marcelo Bielsa at the helm of Olympique de Marseille. He was sacked the following 19 April due to concerns over his behaviour, with the team ranking 15th in Ligue 1.

Míchel became Málaga CF&#x27;s third manager of the season on 7 March 2017, following Juande Ramos and Marcelo Romero. He signed until 30 June 2018 but, on 13 January of that year, with his team in last position, he was relieved of his duties.

On 20 May 2019, Míchel was appointed at Club Universidad Nacional of the Mexican Liga MX. He resigned from office on 23 July 2020, due to personal and family issues.

Míchel returned to Getafe on 27 May 2021, replacing Valencia CF-bound José Bordalás. Having gained just one point from eight games of the season, he was dismissed on 4 October.

On 21 September 2022, Míchel returned to Olympiacos after seven years away, replacing compatriot Carlos Corberán. He resigned on 3 April 2023 following a 2–2 draw with Aris Thessaloniki F.C. despite being 2–0 up 20 minutes from time; he had allegedly lost the confidence of the board of directors and supporters due to his difficulties in handling the pressure of mounting a title challenge.

On 27 October 2023, Míchel signed with Saudi First Division League club Al Qadsiah FC.

<text>Engineering Research Associates, commonly known as ERA, was a pioneering computer firm from the 1950s. ERA became famous for their numerical computers, but as the market expanded they became better known for their drum memory systems. They were eventually purchased by Remington Rand and merged into their UNIVAC department. Many of the company founders later left to form Control Data Corporation.

==Wartime origins of ERA==
The ERA team started as a group of scientists and engineers working for the US Navy during WWII on code-breaking, a division known as the Communications Supplementary Activity - Washington (CSAW). After the war budgets were cut for most military projects, including CSAW. Joseph Wenger of the Navy&#x27;s cryptoanalytic group was particularly worried that the CSAW team would spread to various companies and the Navy would lose their ability to quickly design new machines.

==Post-war organization==
Wenger and two members of the CSAW team, William Norris and Howard Engstrom, started looking for investors interested in supporting the development of a new computer company. Their only real lead, at Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., eventually fell through.

They then met John Parker, an investment banker who had run Northwest Aeronautical Corporation (NAC), a glider subsidiary of Chase Aircraft, in St. Paul, Minnesota. NAC was in the process of shutting down as the war ended most contracts, and Parker was looking for new projects to keep the factory running. He was told nothing about the work the team would do, but after being visited by a series of increasingly high-ranking naval officers culminating with James Forrestal, he knew &quot;something&quot; was up and decided to give it a try. Norris, Engstrom, and their group incorporated ERA in January, 1946, hired forty of their codebreaking colleagues, and moved to the NAC factory. 

During the early years, the company took on any engineering work that came their way, but were generally kept in business developing new code-breaking machines for the Navy. Most of the machines were custom-built to crack a specific code, and increasingly used magnetic drum memory to process and analyze the coded texts. To ensure secrecy, the factory was declared to be a Navy Reserve base, and armed guards were posted at the entrance. ERA&#x27;s numerous military and intelligence projects contributed to Minnesota&#x27;s becoming &quot;the Land of 10,000 Top-Secret Computer Projects.&quot;

==Goldberg and Demon codebreakers==
Their first machine, Goldberg, completed in 1947, used a crude drum made by gluing magnetic tape to the surface of a large metal cylinder that could be spun at 50 RPM for reading (and much slower for writing). Over the next few years, the drum memory systems increased in capacity and speed, along with the paper tape readers needed to feed the data onto the drums. They later ended up in a major patent fight with Technitrol Engineering, who introduced a drum memory of their own in 1952.

One of the follow-on machines, Demon, was built to crack a specific Soviet code. In 1949 the code was changed, rendering the machine useless. James Pendergrass, a Navy officer attached to the codebreaking unit, had attended a series of lectures at the Moore School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946, and became convinced the only lasting solution to the code breaking problem was a computer that could be quickly re-programmed to work on different tasks. In 1947 the Navy awarded ERA a contract, &quot;Task 13&quot;, to develop what was destined to be the first stored program computer in the U.S. The machine, known as the Atlas, used drum memory and was delivered in 1950. ERA then started to sell it commercially as the ERA 1101, 1101 being binary for 13. Even before delivery of the Atlas, the Navy asked for a more powerful machine using both Williams tubes and drum memory, a machine known as the Atlas II. Work began in 1950 and the completed Atlas II was delivered to the still-secret NSA in September 1953.

==&quot;High-speed Computing Devices&quot;==
In 1950, ERA published &quot;High-speed Computing Devices,&quot; a 450-page textbook that summarized the state of computer technology at that time. It describes the basic components of digital logic, the devices and circuits used to build these components, and the principles of computer design and programming. This book was a revision of a report submitted to the Office of Naval Research, omitting references to cryptography; Mina Rees, then director of the ONR mathematical section, suggested that it should be published.

One of the book&#x27;s most successful predictions concerned the transistor, which had recently been invented at Bell Laboratories: &quot;It will probably be competitive with the electron tube in total cost per stage.&quot; (page 423)

==Legal troubles and the Remington Rand acquisition==
ERA looked to selling similar machines to a number of customers, but at about this time they became embroiled in a lengthy series of political maneuvering in Washington. Drew Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round&quot; claimed that the founding of ERA was a conflict of interest for Norris and Engstrom because they had used their war-time government connections to set up a company for their own profit. The resulting legal fight left the company drained, both financially and emotionally. In 1952 they were purchased by Remington Rand, largely as a result of these problems.

Remington Rand already had a computing division however, after they had purchased the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation in 1950. For a time the two companies operated as independent units within Remington, with ERA focusing on scientific and military customers, while Eckert–Mauchly&#x27;s UNIVACs were sold to business customers. However, in 1955 Remington merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand. Both ERA and Eckert–Mauchly were folded into a single division as Sperry-UNIVAC. Much of ERA&#x27;s work was dropped, while their drum technology was used in newer UNIVAC machines. A number of employees were not happy with this move and decamped to form Control Data Corporation under the leadership of Norris. Among them was Seymour Cray, who went on to design supercomputers and create Cray Computers.

But the core of the ERA team lived on. Eventually they were moved to a new research division where they had considerably more freedom. They worked primarily on computing systems for military use, and they pioneered a number of early command and control and guidance systems for ICBMs and satellites. There they were known as the Military Division, which was later renamed the Aerospace Division.

==The new ERA==
In the late 1970s, a number of Rand employees purchased the ERA name and started a small government contracting firm. In 1989, the new ERA became a wholly owned subsidiary of E-Systems. In 1995, it was merged into the Melpar division of its parent and the name once again disappeared.

<doc id="77904" wikidata="Q7697098" url="?curid=77904" title="Television receive-only">
<text>Television receive-only (TVRO) is a term used chiefly in North America, South America to refer to the reception of satellite television from FSS-type satellites, generally on C-band analog; free-to-air and unconnected to a commercial DBS provider. TVRO was the main means of consumer satellite reception in the United States and Canada until the mid-1990s with the arrival of direct-broadcast satellite television services such as PrimeStar, USSB, Bell Satellite TV, DirecTV, Dish Network, Sky TV that transmit Ku signals. While these services are at least theoretically based on open standards (DVB-S, MPEG-2, MPEG-4), the majority of services are encrypted and require proprietary decoder hardware. TVRO systems relied on feeds being transmitted unencrypted and using open standards, which heavily contrasts to DBS systems in the region.

The term is also used to refer to receiving digital television &quot;backhaul&quot; feeds from FSS-type satellites. Reception of free-to-air satellite signals, generally Ku band Digital Video Broadcasting, for home viewing is still common in Europe and India, although the TVRO nomenclature was never used there. Free-to-air satellite signals are also very common in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, as many rural locations cannot receive cable television and solely rely on satellites to deliver television signals to individual homes.

==&quot;Big ugly dish&quot;==
The term &quot;BUD&quot; (big ugly dish) is a colloquialism for C-Band satellite dishes used by TVRO systems. BUDs range from 4 to 16 feet in diameter, with the most popular large size being 10 feet. The name comes from their perception as an eyesore.

==History==

TVRO systems were originally marketed in the late 1970s. On October 18, 1979, the FCC began allowing people to have home satellite earth stations without a federal government license. The dishes were nearly in diameter, were remote controlled, and could only pick up HBO signals from one of two satellites.

Originally, the dishes used for satellite TV reception were 12 to 16 feet in diameter and made of solid fiberglass with an embedded metal coating, with later models being 4 to 10 feet and made of wire mesh and solid steel or aluminum. Early dishes cost more than $5,000, and sometimes as much as $10,000. The wider the dish was, the better its ability to provide adequate channel reception. Programming sent from ground stations was relayed from 18 satellites in geostationary orbit located 22,300 miles above the Earth. The dish had to be pointed directly at the satellite, with nothing blocking the signal. Weaker signals required larger dishes.

The dishes worked by receiving a low-power C-Band (3.7–4.2 GHz) frequency-modulated analog signal directly from the original distribution satellite – the same signal received by cable television headends. Because analog channels took up an entire transponder on the satellite, and each satellite had a fixed number of transponders, dishes were usually equipped with a modified polar mount and actuator to sweep the dish across the horizon to receive channels from multiple satellites. Switching between horizontal and vertical polarization was accomplished by a small electric servo motor that moved a probe inside the feedhorn throat at the command of the receiver (commonly called a &quot;polarotor&quot; setup). Higher-end receivers did this transparently, switching polarization and moving the dish automatically as the user changed channels.

By Spring of 1984, 18 C-Band satellites were in use for United States domestic communications, owned by five different companies.
The retail price for satellite receivers soon dropped, with some dishes costing as little as $2,000 by mid-1984. Dishes pointing to one satellite were even cheaper. Once a user paid for a dish, it was possible to receive even premium movie channels, raw feeds of news broadcasts or television stations from other areas. People in areas without local broadcast stations, and people in areas without cable television, could obtain good-quality reception with no monthly fees. Two open questions existed about this practice: whether the Communications Act of 1934 applied as a case of &quot;unauthorized reception&quot; by TVRO consumers; and to what extent it was legal for a service provider to encrypt their signals in an effort to prevent its reception.

The Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984 clarified all of these matters, making the following legal:

* Reception of unencrypted satellite signals by a consumer
* Reception of encrypted satellite signals by a consumer, when they have received authorization to legally decrypt it

This created a framework for the wide deployment of encryption on analog satellite signals. It further created a framework (and implicit mandate to provide) subscription services to TVRO consumers to allow legal decryption of those signals. HBO and Cinemax became the first two services to announce intent to encrypt their satellite feeds late in 1984. Others were strongly considering doing so as well. Where cable providers could compete with TVRO subscription options, it was thought this would provide sufficient incentive for competition.

HBO and Cinemax began encrypting their west coast feeds services with VideoCipher II 12 hours a day early in 1985, then did the same with their east coast feeds by August. The two networks began scrambling full time on January 15, 1986, which in many contemporary news reports was called &quot;S-Day&quot;. This met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels. As required by the Cable Communications Policy act of 1984, HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service, although at a price ($12.95 per month) higher than what cable subscribers were paying. This sentiment, and a collapse in the sales of TVRO equipment in early 1986, led to the April 1986 attack on HBO&#x27;s transponder on Galaxy 1. Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since some people would never have cable service, and the industry was starting to recover as a result. Through 1986, other channels that began full time encryption included Showtime and The Movie Channel on May 27, and CNN and CNN Headline News on July 1. Scrambling would also lead to the development of pay-per-view, as demonstrated by the early adoption of encryption by Request Television, and Viewer&#x27;s Choice. Channels scrambled (encrypted) with VideoCipher and VideoCipher II could be defeated, and there was a black market for illegal descramblers.

By the end of 1987, 16 channels had employed encryption with another 7 planned in the first half of 1988. Packages that offered reduced rates for channels in bulk had begun to appear. At this time, the vast majority of analog satellite TV transponders still were not encrypted. On November 1, 1988, NBC began scrambling its C-band signal but left its Ku band signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising. Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band. ABC and CBS were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local network affiliates.

The growth of dishes receiving Ku band signals in North America was limited by the Challenger disaster, since 75 satellites were to be launched prior to the suspension of the Space Shuttle program. Only seven Ku band satellites were in use.

In addition to encryption, DBS services such as PrimeStar had been reducing the popularity for TVRO systems since the early 1990s. Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent Ku band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the solar panels and energy efficiency of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the digital signals now used require far less signal strength at the receiver, resulting in a lower cost of entry. Each satellite also can carry up to 32 transponders in the Ku band, but only 24 in the C band, and several digital subchannels can be multiplexed (MCPC) or carried separately (SCPC) on a single transponder. General advances, such as HEMT, in noise reduction at microwave frequencies have also had an effect. However, a consequence of the higher frequency used for DBS services is rain fade where viewers lose signal during a heavy downpour. C-band&#x27;s immunity to rain fade is one of the major reasons the system is still used as the preferred method for television broadcasters to distribute their signal.

===Popularity===
TVRO systems were most popular in rural areas, beyond the broadcast range of most local television stations. The mountainous terrain of West Virginia, for example, makes reception of over-the-air television broadcasts (especially in the higher UHF frequencies) very difficult. From the late 1970s to the early 1990s DBS systems were not available, and cable television systems of the time only carried a few channels, resulting in a boom in sales of systems in the area, which led to the systems being termed the &quot;West Virginia state flower&quot;. The term was regional, known mostly to those living in West Virginia and surrounding areas. Another reason was the large sizes of the dishes. The first satellite systems consisted of &quot;BUDs&quot; twelve to sixteen feet in diameter. They became much more popular in the mid-1980s when dish sizes decreased to about six to ten feet, but have always been a source of much consternation (even local zoning disputes) due to their perception as an eyesore. Neighborhoods with restrictive covenants usually still prohibit this size of dish, except where such restrictions are illegal. Support for systems dried up when strong encryption was introduced around 1994. Many long-disconnected dishes still occupy their original spots.

== TVRO on ships ==
The term TVRO has been in use on ships since it was introduced in the 1980s. One early provider of equipment was SeaTel with its first generation of stabilized satellite antennas that was launched in 1985, the TV-at-Sea 8885 system. Until this time ships had not been able to receive television signals from satellites due to their rocking motion rendering reception impossible. The SeaTel antenna however was stabilized using electrically driven gyroscopes and thus made it possible to point to the satellite accurately enough, that is to within 2°, in order to receive a signal. The successful implementation of stabilised TVRO systems on ships immediately led to the development of maritime VSAT systems. The second generation of SeaTel TVRO systems came in 1994 and was the 2494 antenna, which got its gyro signal from the ship rather than its own gyros, improving accuracy and reducing maintenance.

As of 2010, SeaTel continues to dominate the market for stabilized TVRO systems and has according to the Comsys group, a market share of 75%. Other established providers of stabilised satellite antennas are Intellian, KNS, Orbit, EPAK and KVH.

==Current uses==
Most of the free analogue channels that BUDs were built to receive have been taken offline. Due to the number of systems in existence, their lack of usefulness, and because many people consider them an eyesore, used BUDs can be purchased for very little money. As of 2009, there are 23 C-band satellites and 38 Ku/Ka band satellites.

There were over 150 channels for people who want to receive subscription channels on a C-band dish via Motorola&#x27;s 4DTV equipment via two vendors Satellite Receivers Ltd (SRL) and Skyvision . The 4DTV subscription system shutdown on August 16, 2016.

The dishes themselves can be modified to receive free-to-air and DBS signals. The stock LNBs fitted to typical BUDs will usually need to be replaced with one of a lower noise temperature to receive digital broadcasts. With a suitable replacement LNB (provided there is no of the reflector) a BUD can be used to receive free-to-air (FTA) and DBS signals. Several companies market LNBs, LNBFs, and adaptor collars for big-dish systems. For receiving FTA signals the replacement should be capable of dual C/Ku reception with linear polarization, for DBS it will need a high band Ku LNBF using circular polarization. Older mesh dishes with perforations larger than 5mm are inefficient at Ku frequencies, because the smaller wavelengths will pass through them. Solid fiberglass dishes usually contain metal mesh with large-diameter perforations as a reflector and are usually unsuitable for anything other than C band.

Large dishes have higher antenna gain, which can be an advantage when used with DBS signals such as Dish Network and DirecTV, virtually eliminating rain fade. Restored dishes fitted with block upconverters can be used to transmit signals as well. BUDs can still be seen at antenna farms for these reasons, so that video and backhauls can be sent to and from the television network with which a station is affiliated, without interruption due to inclement weather. BUDs are also still useful for picking-up weak signals at the edge of a satellite&#x27;s broadcast &quot;footprint&quot; – the area at which a particular satellite is aimed. For this reason, BUDs are helpful in places like Alaska, or parts of the Caribbean.

===Modern equivalents===
Large parabolic antennas similar to BUDs are still in production. New dishes differ in their construction and materials. New mesh dishes have much smaller perforations and solid dishes are now made with steel instead of fiberglass. New systems usually include a universal LNB that is switched electronically between horizontal and vertical polarization, obviating the need for a failure-prone polar rotor. As a complete system they have a much lower noise temperature than old BUDs, and are generally better for digital Ku reception. The prices of these dishes have fallen dramatically since the first BUDs were produced for several thousand dollars to as little as $200 for an 8 ft mesh started BUD sold on eBay or amazon as of 2014. Typical uses for these systems include receiving free-to-air and subscription services.

<doc id="77911" wikidata="Q41235" url="?curid=77911" title="Emilio Butragueño">
<text>Emilio Butragueño Santos (; born 22 July 1963) is a Spanish retired professional footballer who played as a striker.

He was best known for his spell with Real Madrid. Nicknamed &quot;El Buitre&quot; (The Vulture), he was a member of the &quot;La Quinta del Buitre&quot; along with Manolo Sanchís, Rafael Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza.

Butragueño scored 123 La Liga goals in 341 games for his main club over 12 seasons, and represented the Spain national team in two World Cups (being the second-top scorer in the 1986 edition) and as many European Championships, scoring 26 goals for his country in a record that stood for several years.

==Club career==
In 1981, Madrid-born Butragueño joined the Real Madrid youth system, playing first for their reserves before being given his senior debut by Alfredo Di Stéfano on 5 February 1984 against Cádiz CF: he made an instant impact, scoring twice and assisting for the third goal in a 3–2 away turnaround, after Real trailed by 2–0. On 12 December that year he made his European competition debut, contributing with a hat-trick to a 6–1 home victory over R.S.C. Anderlecht in the third round of the UEFA Cup after the 3–0 loss in Brussels, as the Spaniards went on to win the competition.

At the time, Real Madrid&#x27;s form was so patchy the first team&#x27;s attendances were smaller than those of the reserve side. Butragueño was a part of their transformation, being a prominent member of the squad during the 1980s and winning numerous honours: he received the European Bronze award for best footballer in two consecutive years, and was awarded the Pichichi Trophy in 1991, while also being instrumental in the capital club&#x27;s five La Liga trophies, two Copa del Rey and two consecutive UEFA Cups.

In June 1995, having lost his place (only eight games and one goal, as Real won another league), mainly due to the emergence of 17-year-old Raúl, Butragueño signed for Atlético Celaya in Mexico and, in his first year, the team reached the final of the Liga MX. After three seasons where he was known as the &quot;Gentleman of the Pitch&quot; – never receiving a single red card during his entire career – he decided to retire in April 1998.

==International career==
Butragueño earned 69 caps for Spain, and scored 26 goals. His debut came on 17 October 1984 against Wales in a 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifier, and he closed the 3–0 win in Seville. He had already been picked as an uncapped player for the UEFA Euro 1984 tournament, where his team finished runners-up.

Butragueño was also selected for the 1986 World Cup where he played a major part, scoring four goals as Spain beat Denmark 5–1 in the round-of-16 match. He also took part in the 1990 edition in Italy, scoring no goals in four games.

==Post-retirement and other ventures==

On 19 October 2004, Butragueño replaced former Real Madrid teammate Jorge Valdano as the club&#x27;s director of football and, until the end of the 2005–06 season, also served as its vice-president. Subsequently, he acted as head of public relations for the organisation.

Still as a player, Butragueño had a computer game with his name released in 1988, for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and MSX.

<text>Year 444 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Tribunate of Atratinus, Siculus and Luscus and the Year of the Consulship of Mugillanus and Atratinus (or, less frequently, year 310 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 444 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* The conservative and democratic factions in Athens confront each other. The ambitious new leader of the conservatives, Thucydides, accuses the leader of the democratic faction, Pericles, of profligacy and criticises the way Pericles is spending money on his ambitious building plans for the city. Thucydides manages, initially, to gain the support of the ecclesia. Pericles responds by proposing to reimburse the city for all the expenses from his private property, on the condition that he would make the inscriptions of dedication in his own name. His stance is supported by the ecclesia, so Thucydides&#x27; efforts to dislodge Pericles from power are defeated.

==== Persian empire ====
* Nehemiah, the Jewish cupbearer to Artaxerxes I at Susa, is given permission by Artaxerxes to return to Jerusalem as governor of Judea, in order to rebuild parts of it.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Republic ====
* No consuls are elected in Rome, but rather military tribunes with consular power are appointed in their stead. While only patricians could be consuls, some military tribunes were plebeians. These positions had responsibility for the census, a vital function in the financial administration of Rome. So to stop the plebeians from possibly gaining control of the census, the patricians remove from the consuls and tribunes the right to take the census, and rather entrust it to two magistrates, called &quot;censores&quot; who were to be chosen exclusively from the patricians in Rome.

==== Italy ====
* Pericles founds the colony of Thurii near the site of the former city of Sybaris, in southern Italy. Its colonists include Herodotus and Lysias.

==== Persian Empire ====
* The Jewish priest Ezra assembled and led a band of approximately 5,000 Jews from Babylon to Jerusalem.

==== Greece ====
* Athens allied itself with the city state of Megara which was under pressure from Corinth. This alliance leads to war between Corinth and Athens. The first battle of the war, at Haliesis in the Gulf of Argolis, resulted in a Corinthian victory, but the next battle, the battle of Cecryphalea (modern Angistrion), went Athens&#x27; way.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Aequi occupied Tusculum. In response to the threat, the Roman Senate decided to send an army to help the allied city, under the command of consul Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis. In addition, the consul Fabius Vibulanus, who was at that point besieging Antium, moved his forces to attack Tusculum. The Tusculans were able to recapture their city. A truce was then arranged with the Aequi.

==== Sicily ====
* The Sicilian town of Morgantina was destroyed by Ducetius, Hellenised leader of the Siculi (according to Diodorus Siculus).

<text>Bree is a fictional village in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, east of the Shire. Bree-land, which contains Bree and a few other villages, is the only place where Hobbits and Men lived side by side. It was inspired by the name of the Buckinghamshire village of Brill, meaning &quot;hill-hill&quot;, which Tolkien visited regularly in his early years at the University of Oxford, and informed by his passion for linguistics.

In Bree is &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; inn, where the wizard Gandalf meets the Dwarf Thorin Oakenshield, setting off the quest to Erebor described in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and where Frodo Baggins puts on the One Ring, attracting the attention of the Dark Lord Sauron&#x27;s spies and an attack by the Black Riders.

Scholars have stated that Tolkien chose the placenames of Bree-land carefully, incorporating Celtic elements into the names to indicate that Bree was older than the Shire, whose placenames are English with Old English elements. Others have commented that Bree functions as a place of transition from the comfort and safety of home to the dangers of the journey that lies ahead.

== Fictional history ==

Bree was the starting point for the Fallohide brothers and leaders, Marcho and Blanco, when they travelled west in the year 1601 of the Third Age. They led their Hobbits across the river Baranduin and took the land there to found the Shire.

Two important events leading up to the War of the Ring take place at &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot;. The first is &quot;a chance-meeting&quot; of the Wizard Gandalf and the exiled Dwarf Thorin Oakenshield; this meeting leads to the destruction of Smaug. The second occurs during the journey of Frodo Baggins to Rivendell, when he and his companions stay at &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; for a night. After singing &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late&quot;, Frodo accidentally slips the One Ring on his finger, and becomes invisible. The minor villain Bill Ferny and a squint-eyed &quot;Southerner&quot;, a person from some land far to the south, see him vanish, and inform the Black Riders, who attack the inn. Aragorn saves him and leads the party away, after the innkeeper delivers a letter from Gandalf which he had forgotten to deliver months earlier.

== Fictional geography ==

=== Settlement ===

Bree is an ancient settlement of men in Eriador, some east of the Shire. After the collapse of the kingdom of Arnor, Bree continued to thrive without any central authority for many centuries. As Bree lies at the meeting of two large roadways, the Great East Road and the long disused Greenway or Great North Road, it has for centuries been a centre of trade and a stopping place for travellers. When Arnor in the north waned, Bree&#x27;s prosperity and size declined. Pipe-weed flourishes on the south-facing side of Bree-hill, and the Hobbits of Bree claim to have been the first to smoke it; travellers on the road including Dwarves, Rangers, and Wizards took up the habit when they visited the village on their journeys. Directly west of Bree are the Barrow-downs and the Old Forest. Bree is the chief village of Bree-land, and the only place in Middle-earth where men and hobbits live side by side. The hobbit community is older than that of the Shire, which was originally colonized from Bree. By the time of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Bree is the westernmost settlement of men in Middle-earth, and there is no other settlement of men within a hundred leagues of the Shire. Tom Bombadil knows of Bree, saying in his metrical speech &quot;four miles along the road / you&#x27;ll come upon a village, / Bree under Bree-hill, / with doors looking westward.&quot; 

Tolkien wrote of two different origins for the people of Bree. One was that Bree had been founded and populated by men of the Edain who did not reach Beleriand in the First Age, remaining east of the mountains in Eriador. The other was that they came from the same stock as the Dunlendings.

=== &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; inn ===

&quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; was Bree&#x27;s inn. It served beer to locals, and provided accommodation and food to travellers. One of Eriador&#x27;s major cross-roads was just outside the village: the meeting of the Great East Road and the Greenway. The inn was at a road junction in the centre of the village, at the base of the Bree-hill. &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; was frequented by Men, Hobbits and Dwarves. Bucklanders from the Shire occasionally travelled to the inn. The art of smoking pipe-weed was said to have begun in Bree, and from &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; it spread among the races of Middle-earth. The inn was noted for its fine beer, once sampled by Gandalf. The building is described in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;:

The philologist J. Wust considers what script the writing over the door was in. He notes that the Hobbits had learnt to write from the Dunedain of the Northern kingdom, and could read the &quot;Prancing Pony&quot; inscription but that Pippin could not read the inscriptions on the houses in Minas Tirith, the city in the Southern land of Gondor. Wust suggests that in the North, a &quot;full writing mode&quot; was used for the Tengwar inscriptions, whereas in Gondor, the abbreviated &quot;tehta&quot; mode (with dots and marks above or below the consonants to indicate vowel sounds) was employed, presenting the text quite differently.

== Tolkien&#x27;s choice of names ==

=== Placenames ===

Tolkien stated that the name &quot;Bree&quot; means &quot;hill&quot;; he justified the name by arranging the village and the surrounding Bree-land around a large hill, named Bree-hill. The name of the village of Brill, in Buckinghamshire, which Tolkien visited when he was at the University of Oxford and which inspired him to create Bree, is constructed exactly the same way: &quot;Brill&quot; is a modern contraction of &quot;Breʒ-hyll&quot;. Both syllables are words for the same thing, &quot;hill&quot; – the first is Brythonic (Celtic) and the second Old English. The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that the name &quot;Brill&quot; construction, &quot;hill-hill&quot;, is &quot;therefore in a way nonsense, exactly parallel with Chetwode (or &#x27;wood-wood&#x27;) in Berkshire close by.&quot; The first element &quot;Chet&quot; in &quot;Chetwode&quot; derives from the Brythonic &quot;ced&quot;, meaning &quot;wood&quot;. 

Shippey notes further that Tolkien stated that he had selected Bree-land placenames – Archet, Bree, Chetwood, and Combe – because they &quot;contained non-English elements&quot;, which would make them &quot;sound &#x27;queer&#x27;, to imitate &#x27;a style that we should perhaps vaguely feel to be “Celtic”&#x27;.&quot; Shippey comments that this was part of Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;linguistic heresy&quot;, his theory that the sound of words conveyed both meaning and beauty. The philologist Christopher Robinson writes that Tolkien chose a name to &quot;fit not only its designee, but also the phonological and morphological style of the nomenclature to which it belongs, as well as the linguistic scheme of his invented world.&quot; In Robinson&#x27;s view, Tolkien intentionally selected &quot;Celtic elements that have survived in the place names of England&quot; – like &quot;bree&quot; and &quot;chet&quot; – to mark them as older than the Shire placenames which embody &quot;a hint of the past&quot; with their English and Old English elements. All of this indicates the &quot;remarkable care and sophistication&quot; with which Tolkien constructed the &quot;feigned history and translation from Westron personal and placenames&quot;.

=== Personal names ===


Men of Bree often used plant names as surnames, as with the character Bill Ferny. Barliman Butterbur&#x27;s surname is the name of the herbaceous perennial &quot;Petasites hybridus&quot;. Tolkien described the butterbur as &quot;a fleshy plant with a heavy flower-head on a thick stalk, and very large leaves.&quot; He evidently chose this name as appropriate to a fat man; he suggested that translators use the name of some plant with &quot;butter&quot; in the name if possible, but in any event &quot;a fat thick plant&quot;. The Tolkien scholar Ralph C. Wood writes that the forename &quot;Barliman&quot; too is descriptive, hinting at &quot;the hops that he brews&quot; for his inn, barley being the grain used to make beer.

== A place of transition ==

The Tolkien scholar Thomas Honegger writes that Bree functions &quot;as a point of transition between the hobbit-homeland and the wide expanse of Eriador&quot;, with its mixed population of hobbits and Men. It is clearly separate from the Shire, but its architecture retains &quot;some degree of Shire homeliness and comfort.&quot; The inn is &quot;mannish&quot; but it welcomes Hobbits with rooms &quot;built into the hill, thus imitating traditional hobbit-architecture.&quot; This made it one of Frodo&#x27;s five Homely Houses. Bo Walther, in &quot;Tolkien Studies&quot;, writes that Bree, with &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot; inn, is &quot;creepy but also familiar&quot;, a place where the Hobbits can begin to face their fear of the unknown, &quot;cheered up by the recognizable bouquet of beer and the sight of jovial hobbit faces.&quot;

The scholar of humanities Brian Rosebury quotes at length from the Hobbits&#x27; approach to Bree and their arrival at &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot;, &quot;to bring out the leisurely pace, and the patient attention to sensory impressions, typical of the narrative&quot;. He comments that there is much more detail than would be found in an allegory, and that it describes the &quot;emotional experience of arriving at an unfamiliar place: the little-travelled and socially-deferential Sam (Frodo&#x27;s servant) feels an anxiety from which the others are relatively free.&quot; He states that Tolkien sets &quot;both comforting and terrifying events&quot; in &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot;, insisting that &quot;it remains resolutely unallegorical&quot;: it is &quot;neither a symbol of comfort, nor the abode of giants which it half-appears to Sam&quot;. Rosebury adds that the use of proverbs specific to Bree, like Butterbur&#x27;s &quot;there&#x27;s no accounting for East and West as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the Shire-folk, begging your pardon&quot;, provides both a comic element and &quot;fix[es] the geographical contact-but-distance between the two communities.&quot;

== In adaptations ==

Butterbur appears in both Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s animated 1978 adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Peter Jackson&#x27;s epic live-action 2001 film &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, but in both adaptations most of his scenes are cut. Alan Tilvern voiced Butterbur (credited as &quot;Innkeeper&quot;) in the animated film, while David Weatherley played him in Jackson&#x27;s epic. James Grout played Butterbur in BBC Radio&#x27;s 1981 serialization of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In the 1991 low-budget Russian adaptation of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;Khraniteli&quot;, he appears as &quot;Lavr Narkiss&quot;, played by Nikolay Burov. In the 1993 television miniseries &quot;Hobitit&quot; by Finnish broadcaster Yle, Butterbur (&quot;Viljami Voivalvatti&quot; in Finnish, meaning &quot;William Butter&quot;) was portrayed by Mikko Kivinen. 

In Jackson&#x27;s film, far from being a friendly place as in the book, Bree is constantly unpleasant and threatening; and whereas in the book the Ring just makes Frodo disappear when he puts it on in &quot;The Prancing Pony&quot;, in the film there are special effects with a strong wind, blue light, and the Eye of Sauron. A character credited as &quot;Butterbur, Sr&quot; appears briefly during the prologue of Jackson&#x27;s 2013 &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, portrayed by Richard Whiteside. 

Bree and Bree-land are featured prominently in the PC game &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, which allows the player to explore the town.

<text>DECnet is a suite of network protocols created by Digital Equipment Corporation. Originally released in 1975 in order to connect two PDP-11 minicomputers, it evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol.

DECnet was built right into the DEC flagship operating system OpenVMS since its inception. Later Digital ported it to Ultrix, OSF/1 (later Tru64) as well as Apple Macintosh and IBM PC running variants of DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows under the name PATHWORKS, allowing these systems to connect to DECnet networks of VAX machines as terminal nodes.

While the DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation, DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including ones for FreeBSD and Linux. DECnet code in the Linux kernel was marked as orphaned on February 18, 2010 and removed August 22, 2022.

==Evolution==
DECnet refers to a specific set of hardware and software networking products which implement the DIGITAL Network Architecture (DNA). The DIGITAL Network Architecture has a set of documents which define the network architecture in general, state the specifications for each layer of the architecture, and describe the protocols which operate within each layer. Although network protocol analyzer tools tend to categorize all protocols from DIGITAL as &quot;DECnet&quot;, strictly speaking, non-routed DIGITAL protocols such as LAT, SCS, AMDS, LAST/LAD are not DECnet protocols and are not part of the DIGITAL Network Architecture.

To trace the evolution of DECnet is to trace the development of DNA. The beginnings of DNA were in the early 1970s. DIGITAL published its first DNA specification at about the same time that IBM announced its Systems Network Architecture (SNA). Since that time, development of DNA has evolved through the following phases:

===1970–1980===
Phase I (1974)
Support limited to two PDP-11s running the RSX-11 operating system, or a small number of PDP-8s running the RTS-8 operating system, with communication over point-to-point (DDCMP) links between nodes.

Phase II (1975)
Support for networks of up to 32 nodes with multiple, different implementations which could inter-operate with each other. Implementations expanded to include RSTS, TOPS-10, TOPS-20 and VAX/VMS with communications between processors still limited to point-to-point links only. Introduction of downline loading (MOP), and file transfer using File Access Listener (FAL), remote file access using Data Access Protocol (DAP), task-to-task programming interfaces and network management features.

Phase III (1980). Support for networks of up to 255 nodes with 8-bit addresses, over point-to point and multi-drop links. Introduction of adaptive routing capability, record access, a network management architecture, and gateways to other types of networks including IBM&#x27;s SNA and CCITT Recommendation X.25.

===1981–1986===
Phase IV and Phase IV+ (1982).
Phase IV was released initially to RSX-11 and VMS systems, later TOPS-20, TOPS-10, ULTRIX, VAXELN, and RSTS/E gained support. Support for networks of up to 64,449 nodes (63 areas of 1023 nodes) with 16-bit addresses, datalink capabilities expanded beyond DDCMP to include Ethernet local area network support as the datalink of choice, expanded adaptive routing capability to include hierarchical routing (areas, level 1 and level 2 routers), VMScluster support (cluster alias) and host services (CTERM). CTERM allowed a user on one computer to log into another computer remotely, performing the same function that Telnet does in the TCP/IP protocol stack. Digital also released a product called the PATHWORKS client, and more commonly known as the PATHWORKS 32 client, that implemented much of DECnet Phase IV for DOS, and 16 and 32 bit Microsoft Windows platforms (all the way through to Windows Server 2003).

Phase IV implemented an 8 layer architecture similar to the OSI (7 layer) model especially at the lower levels. Since the OSI standards were not yet fully developed at the time, many of the Phase IV protocols remained proprietary.

The Ethernet implementation was unusual in that the software changed the physical address of the Ethernet interface on the network to AA-00-04-00-xx-yy where xx-yy reflected the DECnet network address of the host. This allowed ARP-less LAN operation because the LAN address could be deduced from the DECnet address. This precluded connecting two NICs from the same DECnet node onto the same LAN segment, however.

The initial implementations released were for VAX/VMS and RSX-11, later this expanded to virtually every operating system DIGITAL ever shipped with the notable exception of RT-11. DECnet stacks are found on Linux, SunOS and other platforms, and Cisco and other network vendors offer products that can cooperate with and operate within DECnet networks. Full DECnet Phase IV specifications are available.

At the same time that DECnet Phase IV was released, the company also released a proprietary protocol called LAT for serial terminal access via Terminal servers. LAT shared the OSI physical and datalink layers with DECnet and LAT terminal servers used MOP for the server image download and related bootstrap processing.

Enhancements made to DECnet Phase IV eventually became known as DECnet Phase IV+, although systems running this protocol remained completely interoperable with DECnet Phase IV systems.

===1987 &amp; beyond===
Phase V and Phase V+ (1987).
Support for very large (architecturally unlimited) networks, a new network management model, local or distributed name service, improved performance over Phase IV. Move from a proprietary network to an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) by integration of ISO standards to provide multi-vendor connectivity and compatibility with DNA Phase IV, the last two features resulted in a hybrid network architecture (DNA and OSI) with separate &quot;towers&quot; sharing an integrated transport layer. Transparent transport level links to TCP/IP were added via the IETF RFC 1006 (OSI over IP) and RFC 1859 (NSP over IP) standards &quot;(see diagram)&quot;.

It was later renamed DECnet/OSI to emphasize its OSI interconnectability, and subsequently DECnet-Plus as TCP/IP protocols were incorporated.

==Notable installations==

===DEC Easynet===

DEC&#x27;s internal corporate network was a DECnet network called Easynet, which had evolved from DEC&#x27;s Engineering Net (E-NET). It included over 2,000 nodes as of 1984, 15,000 nodes (in 39 countries) as of 1987, and 54,000 nodes as of 1990.

===The DECnet Internet===
DECnet was used at various scientific research centers which linked their networks to form an international network called the DECnet Internet. This included the U.S. Space Physics Analysis Network (US-SPAN), the European Space Physics Analysis Network (E-SPAN), Energy Sciences Network, and other research and education networks. The network consisted of over 17,000 nodes as of 1989. Routing between networks with different address spaces involved the use of either &quot;poor man&#x27;s routing&quot; (PMR) or address translation gateways. In December 1988, VAX/VMS hosts on the DECnet Internet were attacked by the Father Christmas worm.

===CCNET===
CCNET (Computer Center Network) was a DECnet network that connected the campuses of various universities in the eastern regions of the United States during the 1980s. A key benefit was the sharing of systems software developed by the operations staff at the various sites, all of which were using a variety of DEC computers. As of March 1983, it included Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, and Case Western Reserve University. By May 1986, New York University, Stevens Institute of Technology, Vassar College and Oberlin College had been added. Several other universities joined later.

<doc id="77929" wikidata="Q192761" url="?curid=77929" title="County Armagh">
<text>County Armagh ( ) is one of the six counties of Northern Ireland and one of the traditional thirty-two counties of Ireland. It is located in the province of Ulster and adjoins the southern shore of Lough Neagh. It borders the Northern Irish counties of Tyrone to the west and Down to the east. The county borders Louth and Monaghan to the south and southwest, which are in the Republic of Ireland. It is named after its county town, Armagh, which derives from the Irish &quot;Ard Mhacha&quot;, meaning &quot;Macha&#x27;s height&quot;. Macha was a sovereignty goddess in Irish mythology and is said to have been buried on a wooded hill around which the town of Armagh grew. County Armagh is colloquially known as the &quot;Orchard County&quot; because of its many apple orchards.

The county covers an area of , making it the smallest of Northern Ireland&#x27;s six counties by size and the sixth-smallest county on the island of Ireland. With a population of 194,394 as of the 2021 census, it is the fourth-most populous county in both Northern Ireland and Ulster. It is the 10th most populous of Ireland&#x27;s 32 traditional counties, as well as the fifth-most densely populated. In addition to the city of Armagh and the western portion of the city of Newry, notable towns in the county include Lurgan, Portadown and Craigavon.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Armagh&quot; derives from the Irish &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Macha&#x27;s height&quot;/&quot;Macha&#x27;s high place&quot;. Macha is a mythological figure who is mentioned in &quot;The Book of the Taking of Ireland&quot;. Macha is also said to have been responsible for the construction of the hill site of (now Navan Fort near Armagh City) to serve as the capital of the kings (who give their name to Ulster) and is believed to be the high place from which the county takes its name.

==Geography and features==
From its highest point at Slieve Gullion, in the south of the county, Armagh&#x27;s land falls away from its rugged south with Carrigatuke, Lislea and Camlough mountains, to rolling drumlin country in the middle and west of the county. In the north it gives way to flatlands where rolling flats and small hills reach sea level at Lough Neagh.

County Armagh&#x27;s boundary with Louth is marked by the rugged Ring of Gullion rising in the south of the county, whilst much of its boundary with counties Monaghan and Down goes unnoticed with seamless continuance of drumlins and small lakes. The River Blackwater marks the border with County Tyrone, and Lough Neagh otherwise marks the county&#x27;s northern boundary.

Numerous uninhabited islands are located in the county&#x27;s section of Lough Neagh: Coney Island Flat, Croaghan Flat, Padian, Phil Roe&#x27;s Flat, and the Shallow Flat.

===Climate===
Despite lying in the east of Ireland, Armagh enjoys an oceanic climate strongly influenced by the Gulf Stream: featuring damp mild winters, and temperate, wet summers. Overall temperatures rarely drop below freezing during daylight hours, though frost is not infrequent in the months November to February. Snow rarely lies for longer than a few hours even in the elevated south-east of the county. Summers are mild and wet and, although with sunshine often interspersed with showers, daylight lasts for almost 18 hours during high-summer.

On 22 July 2021 the record for highest outside air temperature ever measured in Northern Ireland was set in Armagh City when a reading of 31.4 °C was registered at Armagh Observatory&#x27;s weather station.

==History==
Ancient Armagh was the territory of the Ulaid (also known as Voluntii, Ultonians, Ulidians, Ulstermen) before the fourth century AD. It was ruled by the Red Branch, whose capital was Emain Macha (or Navan Fort) near Armagh. The site, and subsequently the city, were named after the goddess Macha. The Red Branch play an important role in the Ulster Cycle, as well as the Cattle Raid of Cooley. However, they were eventually driven out of the area by the Three Collas, who invaded in the 4th century and held power until the 12th. The Clan Colla ruled the area known as Airghialla or Oriel for these 800 years.

The chief Irish clans of the county were descendants of the Collas, the O&#x27;Hanlons and Mac Cana, and the Uí Néill, the O&#x27;Neills of Fews. Armagh was divided into several baronies: Armagh was held by the O&#x27;Rogans, Lower Fews was held by O&#x27;Neill of the Fews, and Upper Fews were under governance of the O&#x27;Larkins, who were later displaced by the MacCanns. Oneilland East was the territory of the O&#x27;Garveys, who were also displaced by the MacCanns. Oneilland West, like Oneilland East, was once O&#x27;Neill territory, until it was then held by the MacCanns, who were Lords of Clanbrassil. Upper and Lower Orior were O&#x27;Hanlon territory. Tiranny was ruled by Ronaghan. Miscellaneous tracts of land were ruled by O&#x27;Kelaghan. The area around the base of Slieve Gullion near Newry also became home to a large number of the Clan McGuinness as they were dispossessed of hereditary lands held in the County Down.

St. Patrick is considered the first bishop of the Diocese of Armagh. County Armagh is presently one of four counties of Northern Ireland to have a majority of the population from a Catholic background, according to the 2011 census.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, County Armagh was a major center of guerrilla warfare, cattle raiding, and brigandage by local Rapparees; including Count Redmond O&#x27;Hanlon, Cormacke Raver O&#x27;Murphy, and Séamus Mór Mac Murchaidh.

===The Troubles===

The southern part of the county has been a stronghold of support for the Provisional IRA, earning it the nickname &quot;Bandit Country&quot;. South Armagh is predominantly nationalist, with much of the population being opposed to any form of British presence, especially that of a military nature. The most prominent opposition to British rule was the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade.

On 10 March 2009, the Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA), a republican paramilitary group that emerged from a split in the Provisional IRA, claimed responsibility for the fatal shooting of a PSNI officer in Craigavon, County Armagh—the first police fatality in Northern Ireland since 1998. The officer was fatally shot by a sniper as he and a colleague investigated &quot;suspicious activity&quot; at a house nearby when a window was smashed by youths causing the occupant to phone the police. The PSNI officers responded to the emergency call, giving a CIRA sniper the chance to shoot and kill officer Stephen Carroll.

==Administration==
The county was administered by Armagh County Council from 1899 until the abolition of county councils in Northern Ireland in 1973.

County Armagh remains officially used for purposes such as a Lieutenancy area – the county retains a lord lieutenant who acts as representative of the British Monarch in the county.

Currently the county is covered for local government purposes by three district councils, namely Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council, approximately the western third of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and a part of Mid Ulster District Council, centred around Peatlands Park.

Armagh ceased to serve as an electoral constituency in 1983 but remains the core of the Newry and Armagh constituency represented at Westminster and the Newry and Armagh constituency represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly. County Armagh also remains as a district for legal and property purposes; however, its baronies no longer have any administrative use.

The -XZ suffix is currently used on vehicle registration plates for vehicles registered in County Armagh. Other suffixes have been -IB and -LZ. These marks are followed by up to four numbers, e.g., JLZ 6789

== Demography ==

As of the 2021 Census, County Armagh recorded a population of 194,394. It is one of four counties in Northern Ireland with a Catholic majority, with 58% of the population coming from a Catholic community background. Around 10% of the population was born outside the United Kingdom and Ireland, mainly immigrants from the European Union and concentrated in the Craigavon urban area (Lurgan, Portadown and Craigavon).

<text>Brian Boru (; modern ; 23 April 1014) was the High King of Ireland from 1002–1014. He ended the domination of the High Kingship of Ireland by the Uí Néill, and is likely responsible for ending Viking invasions of Ireland. Brian Boru is mentioned in the Annals of Inisfallen and in Chronicon Scotorum as &quot;Brian mac Cennétig&quot; (Brian, son of Cennétig). The name &quot;Brian of Bóruma&quot; or &quot;Brian Boru&quot; was given to him posthumously Brian built on the achievements of his father, Cennétig mac Lorcain, and especially his elder brother, Mathgamain. Brian first made himself king of Munster, then subjugated Leinster, eventually becoming High King of Ireland. He was the founder of the O&#x27;Brien dynasty, and is widely regarded as one of the most successful and unifying monarchs in medieval Ireland.

With a population of under 500,000 people, Ireland had over 150 kings, with greater or lesser domains. The Uí Néill king Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill, abandoned by his northern kinsmen of the Cenél nEógain and Cenél Conaill, acknowledged Brian as High King at Athlone in 1002. In the decade that followed, Brian campaigned against the northern Uí Néill, who refused to accept his claims; against Leinster, where resistance was frequent; and against the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin. Brian was described in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; as &quot;ardrí Gaidhel Erenn &amp; Gall &amp; Bretan, August iartair tuaiscirt Eorpa uile&quot; (High King of the Gaels of Ireland and the Norse foreigners and the Britons, &quot;Augustus&quot; of all north-western Europe), the only Irish king to receive that distinction in the annals.

Brian&#x27;s hard-won authority was seriously challenged in 1013 when his ally Máel Sechnaill was attacked by the Cenél nEógain king Flaithbertach Ua Néill, with the Ulstermen as his allies. This was followed by further attacks on Máel Sechnaill by the Germanic Norsemen of Dublin under their Norse king Sigtrygg Silkbeard and the Leinstermen led by Máel Mórda mac Murchada. Brian campaigned against these enemies in 1013. In 1014, his armies confronted the armies of Leinster and Dublin. In the resulting Battle of Clontarf Brian was killed; nonetheless, his army was victorious against the Leinstermen and Norsemen. The battle is widely lauded as a pivotal moment in Irish history, and is well known in popular memory.

Brian was well regarded by contemporary chroniclers. The Norse-Gaels and Scandinavians also produced works mentioning Brian, including &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot;, the &quot;Orkneyinga Saga&quot;, and the now-lost &quot;Brian&#x27;s Saga&quot;. Brian&#x27;s war against Máel Mórda and Sigtrygg was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to Gormlaith, Máel Mórda&#x27;s sister and Sigtrygg&#x27;s mother, who had been in turn the wife of Amlaíb Cuarán, king of Dublin and York, then of Máel Sechnaill, and finally of Brian himself.

==Family background==
Brian Boru was one of the twelve sons of Cennétig mac Lorcáin (d. 951), who was King of Dál gCais and king of Tuadmumu (Thomond), modern County Clare, then a sub-kingdom in the north of Munster. Cennétig was described as &quot;rígdamna Caisil&quot;, meaning that he was either heir or candidate (&quot;king material&quot;) to the kingship of Cashel or Munster, although this might be a later interpolation. Brian&#x27;s mother was Bé Binn inion Urchadh, daughter of Urchadh mac Murchadh (d. 945), king of Maigh Seóla in west Connacht. That they belonged to the Uí Briúin Seóla may explain why he received the name Brian, which was rare among the Dál gCais.

Brian&#x27;s family were descended from the Ui Tairdelbach branch of the Dal gCais (or Deis Tuisceart). This branch had recently taken power from the Ui Óengusso branch which had traditionally supplied the kings of the Dal gCais (also known as the Deisi Tuaiscirt). The Uí Toirdhealbhach had extended their influence over Thomond and in 925 the annals note that Ánrothán son of Máel Gorm assumed the kingship of Corco Mruad. In 934 Reabachán mac Mothla died and was named as &quot;King of the Dál gCais&quot; in the Annals (the earliest usage of this term). The same year of his death, his son Dub Gilla was killed by Brian&#x27;s uncle Conghalach and Brian&#x27;s grandfather Lorcáin is said to have succeeded to the kingship. He enjoyed a short reign before being succeeded by his own son Cinnéidigh who was the first King of Dál gCais to lead an army outside his own territory and lead an expedition as far north as Athlone. By his death in 951, he had been acknowledged as &quot;King of Tuadmumu&quot;. His brother, Mathgamain, built on these achievements and was the first to capture Cashel and become King of Munster.

== Early life ==
Brian was born at Kincora, his father&#x27;s residence or fort in Killaloe, a town in the region of Tuadmumu. Brian&#x27;s posthumous cognomen &quot;Bóruma&quot; (anglicised as Boru) may have referred to &quot;Béal Bóruma&quot;, a fort north of Killaloe, where the Dál gCais held sway. Another explanation, though possibly a late (re-)interpretation, is that the nickname represented Old Irish &quot;bóruma&quot; &quot;of the cattle tribute&quot;, referring to his capacity as a powerful overlord.

As the youngest of twelve brothers, Brian was highly unlikely to be heir to his father&#x27;s throne. When he was young, he was sent to a monastery to study Latin and the history of Ireland. He was taught at the monastery on the island of Innisfallen, near modern Killarney in County Kerry. His teacher or mentor was the noted monk, Maelsuthain Ua Cearbhaill, an Eóganacht chief who had become the head of the monastery, noted for starting the Annals of Inisfallen. Ua Cearbhaill would later become Brian&#x27;s &quot;anmchara&quot; (advisor). However, when Brian was ten years old, he received news that his father had been killed in battle with the Vikings of Limerick, and he was brought home.

According to a biography of Brian, he once witnessed a raid on a Dal gCáis fort by the Vikings of Limerick. The fort was located on the banks of the River Shannon, allowing the Vikings to sail up the river from Limerick to attack it. According to the story, Brian, Mathgamain, and another older brother were on a hill or high ground near the fort tending to a herd of cattle. While they were there, they saw the raid from the mountainside after hearing screams and seeing smoke in the sky. They rushed down to the town, only to find the Vikings had already left. The settlement was burnt and looted. Brian&#x27;s mother was killed, as were several of Brian&#x27;s brothers who were defending the town, along with many of the townspeople. This event horrified Brian and had a lasting impact on him.

The River Shannon served as an easy route by which raids could be made against the provinces of Connacht and Meath. Both Brian&#x27;s father, Cennétig mac Lorcáin, and his older brother Mathgamain had conducted river-borne raids, in which the young Brian would undoubtedly have participated. This may have been the root of his appreciation for naval forces in his later career.

When their father died, the kingship of Tuadmumu passed to Brian&#x27;s older brother, Mathgamain. Brian and Mathgamain campaigned together throughout Munster. When Mathgamain was killed in 976. Brian replaced him. Subsequently, he became king of the entire kingdom of Munster.

== Reign of Mathgamain ==
In 964, Brian&#x27;s older brother, Mathgamain, claimed control over the entire province of Munster by capturing the Rock of Cashel, capital of the ancient Eóganachta, the hereditary overlords or High Kings of Munster, but who in dynastic strife and with multiple assassinations had weakened themselves to the point they were now impotent. Earlier attacks from both the Uí Néill and Vikings were also factors. This situation allowed the illegitimate (from the Eóganacht perspective) but militarized Dál Cais to attempt to seize the provincial kingship. Mathgamain was never fully recognized and was opposed throughout his career in the 960s and 970s by Máel Muad mac Brain, a semi-outsider from the Cashel perspective but still a legitimate Eóganacht claimant from far south Munster.

In addition to Máel Muad, the Norse king Ivar of Limerick was a threat and may have been attempting to establish some overlordship in the province or a region of it himself, with the &quot;Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib&quot; even asserting he actually achieved this until routed by Mathgamain and Brian in the celebrated Battle of Sulcoit in 968.

Initially, Mathgamain had made peace with the Norse of Limerick. However, Brian was eager to avenge the deaths of his family members at the hands of the Vikings, and deserted with a band of his followers and launched a guerilla campaign against the Vikings from the mountains of Munster. They attacked Viking forts and patrols and survived with whatever food and weapons they found. Their attacks were successful in weakening the Vikings, but casualties began to mount and according to writings by Brian&#x27;s scribe, just 15 men remained. However, at this point Mathgamain, inspired by the courage of his younger brother, decided to attack the Vikings with Brian and drive them from Limerick and Munster once and for all.

They gathered an army of kings from all over Munster, including their former enemy Maél Muad. They ambushed and routed the Norse at the Battle of Sulcoit. They followed up their victory by looting and burning Limerick. They killed every man of fighting age and enslaved the rest of the population.

This was the first of three battles which highlighted Brian&#x27;s career. This victory was not decisive and eventually there grew up a brief alliance of sorts between Mathgamain, Máel Muad and others to drive the Norse &quot;soldiers&quot; or &quot;officials&quot; out of Munster and destroy their Limerick fortress in 972. The two Gaelic claimants were soon back to fighting and the fortuitous capture of Mathgamain in 976 by Donnubán mac Cathail allowed him to be effortlessly dispatched or murdered by Máel Muad, who would now rule as king of Cashel for two years.

== Early reign in Munster ==
Despite the death of Mathgamain, the Dál gCais remained a powerful force. Mathgamain was succeeded as King of Thomond by Brian, who quickly proved to be as fine a commander of armies as his brother was. After attacking and killing the much-weakened Ivar in the year 977, Brian pursued a new target, intending to eradicate the remaining Viking presence in Munster. Upon ascending to the throne, Imar, ruler or governor of the city of Limerick who was loyal to the now-slain Ivar, fled the city by ship down the River Shannon towards the Shannon estuary and took refuge in a monastery on Inis Cathaigh (Scattery Island), accompanied by his sons. However, in an act of revenge for the death of his brother, Brian set aside the sacred traditions and attacked the island with his troops, slaughtered the Vikings and desecrated the church.

Around the same time, in 978, Brian challenged Máel Muad to battle, and defeated him in the fateful Battle of Belach Lechta. Máel Muad was killed in the battle and afterwards the Eóganachta were no longer viable for the provincial Kingship, which was based upon lineage. Therefore, the Kingship of Munster passed to the Dál gCais, and Brian became king.

Afterwards, the last opposition remaining in Munster was an alliance consisting of the rebellious Irish led by Donnubán (Donovan), the man responsible for Mathgamain&#x27;s death, and the remaining Norse/Viking forces, possibly led by Ivar&#x27;s last remaining son and designated successor, Aralt (Harold). Brian attacked them at the Battle of Cathair Cuan, which may have been either a single battle or an extended conflict over the period 977–978. In any case, the event is mentioned in the Annals, and the later source the &quot;Cogadh&quot; describes Brian making a &quot;great slaughter&quot; of his enemies, killing both Donnubán and Aralt, and securing his position within the province.

However, he did allow some of the Norse to remain in their settlement, as they were wealthy and now central to trade in the region, particularly the slave trade, and possessed a fleet of great value, which Brian would utilise in his later naval expeditions.

Cian, the son of his brother Mathgamain&#x27;s sworn enemy Máel Muad, later became a loyal ally of Brian and served under him in a number of campaigns. According to some accounts, Cian would later marry one of Brian&#x27;s daughters, Sadbh (died 1048).

== Clashes with the High King ==

Having established unchallenged rule over his home Province of Munster, Brian turned to extending his authority over the neighboring provinces of Leinster to the east and Connacht to the north-west. By doing so, he came into conflict with High King Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill whose power base was the Province of Meath.

For the next fifteen years, from 982 to 997, High King Máel Sechnaill repeatedly led armies into Leinster and Munster, while Brian, like his father and brother before him, led his naval forces of around three hundred ships up the Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath on either side of the river. He suffered quite a few reverses in this struggle, but appears to have learned from his setbacks. He developed a military strategy that would serve him well throughout his career: the coordinated use of forces on both land and water, including on rivers and along Ireland&#x27;s coast. Brian&#x27;s naval forces, which included contingents supplied by the Hiberno-Norse cities that he brought under his control (particularly Waterford), provided both indirect and direct support for his forces on land. Indirect support involved a fleet making a diversionary attack on an enemy in a location far away from where Brian planned to strike with his army. Direct support involved naval forces acting as one arm in a strategic pincer, the army forming the other arm.

The conflict began in 982, when Brian was campaigning against the kingdom of Osraige. With Munster undefended, Maél Sechnaill attacked the Dál gCáis, destroying the sacred tree of Adair, under which many of the chiefs of the Dál gCáis had been crowned, including Brian&#x27;s father Cénnetig, his brother Mathgamain and Brian himself. In response, Brian led an army into Westmeath where he plundered the land. Brian&#x27;s fleet did suffer a setback when a squadron of his fleet attacked Connacht, where they killed a prince of Connacht, Muirgius, who was among the defenders. In retaliation, the Connachtmen attacked the ships, massacring the crews.

Mael Sechnaill launched a counter-offensive into Munster and in the ensuing battle he defeated the Dál gCáis, killing around six hundred men, including Brian&#x27;s uncle. There was a period of relative peace between the two afterwards for about nine years, with Brian continuing to campaign elsewhere as he attempted to expand his power in the south and east.

Then in 993, Brian, now in control of much of Munster and gaining ground in Leinster, and unable to make significant progress against the High King on land, decided to utilise his naval superiority to attack Mael Sechnaill. His fleet sailed up the Shannon and invaded the Kingdom of Breifne, in what is now counties Leitrim and Cavan. In doing this, he put pressure on the High King as he was now open to attack from both north and south.

In 996, Brian finally managed to control the province of Leinster, which may have been what led Máel Sechnaill to reach a compromise with him in the following year. The two kings met at Bleanphottogue, on the banks of Lough Ree in County Fermanagh, where the agreement was made. By recognising Brian&#x27;s authority over &quot;Leth Moga,&quot; that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), Máel Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over &quot;Leth Cuinn&quot;, that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, Connacht, and Ulster.

Precisely because he had submitted to Brian&#x27;s authority, the king of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by Máel Mórda mac Murchada. Given the circumstances under which Máel Mórda had been appointed, it is not surprising that he launched an open rebellion against Brian&#x27;s authority. With Leinster in rebellion, the kingdoms of both Brian and Mael Sechnaill were threatened, and thus they decided to briefly sideline their own conflict to defeat Leinster.

Brian assembled the forces of the province of Munster and Mael Sechnaill assembled those of Meath, with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by Máel Mórda&#x27;s ally and cousin, Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Together Máel Mórda and Sigtrygg determined to meet Brian&#x27;s army in battle rather than risk a siege. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the Battle of Glenmama. The Irish annals all agree that this was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had in the aftermath of the Battle of Sulcoit thirty-two years before, by capturing and sacking the enemy&#x27;s city.

Sigtrygg fled the city, seeking support from kings in Ulster, but he was turned away by the Ulaid, leaving Sigtrygg few options but to return to Dublin and submit to Brian. Once again, Brian opted for reconciliation; he requested that Sigtrygg return and resume his position as ruler of Dublin, giving Sigtrygg the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, just as he had with the Eoganacht king, Cian. It may have been on this occasion that Brian married Sigtrygg&#x27;s mother and Máel Mórda&#x27;s sister Gormflaith, the former wife of Máel Sechnaill.

== Struggle for Ireland ==
Brian made it clear that his ambitions had not been satisfied by the compromise of 997 when, in the year 1000, he led a combined Munster-Leinster-Dublin army in an attack on High King Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill&#x27;s home province of Meath. The struggle over who would control all of Ireland was renewed. Máel Sechnaill&#x27;s most important ally was the king of Connacht, Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg, but this presented a number of problems. The provinces of Meath and Connacht were separated by the Shannon River, which served as both a route by which Brian&#x27;s naval forces could attack the shores of either province and as a barrier to the two rulers providing mutual support for each other. Máel Sechnaill came up with an ingenious solution; two bridges would be erected across the Shannon. These bridges would serve as both obstacles preventing Brian&#x27;s fleet from traveling up the Shannon and a means by which the armies of the provinces of Meath and Connacht could cross over into each other&#x27;s kingdoms.

The Annals state that, in the year 1002, Máel Sechnaill surrendered his title to Brian, although they do not say anything about how or why this came about. The &quot;Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh&quot; provides a story in which Brian challenges High King Máel Sechnaill to a battle at the Hill of Tara in the province of Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. Máel Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.

There have been some doubts expressed about this explanation, given Brian&#x27;s style of engaging in war; if he had found his opponent at a disadvantage it is most likely he would have taken full advantage of it rather than allowing his enemy the time to even the odds. Also, given the length and intensity of the struggle between Máel Sechnaill and Brian, it seems unlikely that the High King would surrender his title without a fight. In any case, it is generally accepted that in 1002 Brian became the new High King of Ireland.

== High kingship ==
Brian, then in his 60s, spent the next decade or so of his life subjugating and accepting the submissions of the last of the lesser kingdoms and regions which had not already submitted to him. Those campaigns included two full circuits of the island in 1005 and 1006, demonstrating his determination and energy despite his age.

Unlike some who had previously held the title, Brian intended to be High King in more than name. To accomplish that, he needed to impose his will upon the regional rulers of the only province that did not already recognise his authority, Ulster. The kingdoms of the northern Uí Néill and Ulaid were some of the most powerful in Ireland, and it took Brian considerable time and resources to subdue them.

===Ulster campaigns===
Ulster&#x27;s geography presented a formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, and all three favoured the defenders. Brian first had to find a means of getting through or around these defensive choke points and then he had to subdue the fiercely independent regional kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the kings of Ulster were.

Brian received naval support throughout his northern campaigns from Sigtrygg Silkbeard of Dublin. Silkbeard was eager to enact revenge against the Ulaid for when they refused to assist him after he was forced out of his kingdom of Dublin by Brian following the Battle of Glenmama in 999, forcing Silkbeard to return to Dublin and submit to him.

Brian was also greatly helped by the fact that two years before his first campaign in Ulster, in the year 1003, the brutal battle of Craeb Telcha had taken place between the Northern Uí Néill and the Ulaid, in which the king of the Cenél Eoghain and of the Uí Neill was killed and most of the Ulaid royal bloodline was wiped out, with the Uí Néill gaining victory. This then led to a bloody war of succession within and between the clans of the Ulaid, and together with further attacks from the Uí Néill, which led to the kingdom&#x27;s being severely weakened. Brian accepted the submission of the Cenel Eoghain king in 1005 and later accepted the submission of many of the Ulaid clans at a sacred Ulaid site, Emain Macha.

However Flaithbertaigh Ua Néill, the new king of the Northern Uí Néill and of the Cenél Eoghan, although having already submitted to Brian, was apparently unwilling to accept fully the High King&#x27;s authority, and was quite rebellious. He was known for his continued aggression towards his neighbours despite previously accepting Brian&#x27;s rule. In 1005, after Brian had departed Ulster, he attempted to exert his overlordship over the Ulaid, and seemingly wanted to punish them for submitting to Brian, to which the Northern Uí Néill were vehemently opposed. He attacked the kingdom, killing several kings and princes of the Ulaid. He also took several hostages.

This caused Brian to return in 1006 and again in 1007 to deal with Flaithbertach. On the latter occasion, he removed the hostages of the Ulaid from Flaithbertach&#x27;s custody and took them into his own custody (according to the Annals of Inisfallen, Brian had to take the hostages forcefully). Flaithbertaigh again submitted, and also married one of Brian&#x27;s daughters, Bé Binn.

Despite this, Brian continued to be troubled by the rebellious Flaithbertaigh. In the year 1009, Flaithbertaigh blinded and then executed the king of the Cenél Chonaill. Later that year he would also launch raids in the Midlands going as far south as the River Boyne. This led to Brian&#x27;s return to Ulster yet again, this time taking hostages from the Cenél Eoghain back to his home province, finally gaining the proper submission of Flaithbertaigh.

Flaithbertaigh would then take part in campaigns against the Cenél Chonaill, the final kingdom yet to submit to Brian, in the year 1011 alongside Brian&#x27;s sons Murchad and Domnall. However, they were unsuccessful in gaining the submission of the Cenél Chonaill. Brian then personally proceeded to lead a second invasion later that year, this time successfully subjugating and receiving the submission of the Cenél Chonaill. While Flaithbertaigh would continue attacking the Ulaid and Cenél Chonaill in late 1011 and in 1012, for the time he was no longer of any threat to Brian.

Throughout his campaigns in the province, it was once again Brian&#x27;s coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian&#x27;s army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.

It was during this process that Brian pursued an alternative means of consolidating his control, not merely over the province of Ulster, but over Ireland as a whole. In contrast to its structure elsewhere, the Church in Ireland was not centred around dioceses and archdioceses, but rather around monasteries headed by powerful abbots who were members of the royal dynasties of the lands in which their monasteries resided. Among the most important monasteries was Armagh, located in the Province of Ulster.

Brian&#x27;s advisor, Maelsuthain O&#x27;Carroll, documented in the &quot;Book of Armagh&quot; that, in the year 1005, Brian donated 22 ounces of gold to this monastery and declared that Armagh was the religious capital of Ireland, to which all other monasteries should send the funds they collected. This was a clever move, for the supremacy of the monastery of Armagh would last only so long as Brian remained the High King. Therefore, it was in the interest of Armagh to support Brian with all their wealth and power.

Brian is not referred to in the passage from the &quot;Book of Armagh&quot; as the —that is, High King—but rather he is declared , &#x27;Emperor of the Gaels&#x27;.

Though it is only speculation, it has been suggested that Brian and the Church in Ireland were together seeking to establish a new form of kingship in Ireland, one that was modelled after the kingships of England and France, in which there were no lesser ranks of regional kings—simply one king who had (or sought to have) power over all others in a unitary state. In any case, whether as high king or emperor, by 1011 all of the regional rulers in Ireland acknowledged Brian&#x27;s authority. No sooner had Brian achieved this before it was lost again.

===Rebellion in Leinster===

Máel Mórda mac Murchada of Leinster had only accepted Brian&#x27;s authority grudgingly, and in 1012 he rose in rebellion. The &quot;Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh&quot; relates a story in which one of Brian&#x27;s sons insults Máel Mórda, which leads him to declare his independence from Brian&#x27;s authority and attack his neighbours.

Another possible reason was that the kings of Leinster and Dublin believed Maél Sechnaill was weak and that the Kingdom of Meath was vulnerable. This was because Flaithbertaigh Uí Néill, king of the Cenél Eoghain and the northern Uí Néill, was again becoming troublesome for Brian. In 1013, he raided the Midlands, bringing him into direct conflict with Maél Sechnaill who was the king of Meath. The two armies had a stand-off near Kells, but Maél Sechnaill retreated for unknown reasons before any battle could occur. This led to the belief in Leinster that Meath was vulnerable, which would also weaken Brian if Leinster could knock one of his allies out of any conflict.

Whatever the actual reason was, Máel Mórda sought allies with which to defy the High King. He found one in Flaithbertach Uí Neill in Ulster who had only recently submitted to Brian. Together, they attacked the province of Meath (again), where the former High King Máel Sechnaill sought Brian&#x27;s help to defend his kingdom.

In 1013, Brian led a force from his own province of Munster and from southern Connacht into Leinster, and a detachment under his son, Murchad, ravaged the southern half of the province of Leinster for three months. The forces under Murchad and Brian were reunited on 9 September outside the walls of Dublin. The city was blockaded by Brian&#x27;s fleet, but it was the High King&#x27;s army that ran out of supplies first, so that Brian was forced to abandon the siege and return to Munster around Christmas.

===Battle of Clontarf===

Máel Mórda was aware that the High King would return to Dublin in 1014 to try once more to defeat him. He may have hoped that by defying Brian, he could enlist the aid of all the other regional rulers. If so, he was sorely disappointed. The province of Connacht and most of the province of Ulster failed to support either side of the conflict, with the exception of Flaithbertach Ua Néill of the northern Uí Néill who sent troops to Máel Mórda. His inability to obtain troops from any rulers in Ireland may explain why Máel Mórda sought support from rulers outside Ireland, sending his subordinate and nephew, Sigtrygg, the ruler of Dublin, overseas to do so.

Sigtrygg sailed to Orkney, and on his return stopped at the Isle of Man. These islands had been occupied by the Vikings long before and the Hiberno-Norse had close ties with Orkney and the Isle of Man. There was even a precedent for employing Norsemen from the isles; they had been used by Sigtrygg&#x27;s father, Amlaíb Cuarán, in 980, and by Sigtrygg himself in 990. Their incentive to fight was loot, not land.

It has been argued that, contrary to the assertions made in the &quot;Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh&quot;, this was not an attempt by the Vikings to reconquer Ireland. All of the Norsemen, both the Norse-Gaels of Dublin and the Norsemen from the Isles, were in the service of Máel Mórda. The High King had &#x27;Vikings&#x27; in his army as well: the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick and probably those of Waterford, Wexford, and Cork as well. Some sources include a rival gang of Norse mercenaries from the Isle of Man, led by Brodir&#x27;s own brother, Óspak. The two brothers would go on to fight on opposite sides in the battle. Some scholars argue that, essentially, this conflict was an Irish civil war with minor foreign participation. However, the revisionist idea of Brian Boru&#x27;s campaign and the battle of Clontarf being more akin to a civil war than an international war between the Irish and Norsemen has recently been challenged by researchers from the Universities of Coventry, Oxford and Sheffield. Using network analysis to mathematically analyze the medieval text, they found over 1000 relationships between about 300 characters; as such, the traditional view may be more accurate after all.

Along with whatever troops he obtained from abroad, Brian mustered troops from his home province of Munster, southern Connacht, and the province of Meath, the latter contingent commanded by his old rival Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill. Brian&#x27;s army may have outnumbered Máel Mórda&#x27;s, since Brian felt secure enough to dispatch a mounted detachment under the command of his youngest son, Donnchad, to raid southern Leinster, presumably hoping to force Máel Mórda to release his contingents from there to return to defend their homes.

Brian was also joined by the aforementioned Óspak, a Norseman, brother of Brodir. Initially the two brothers sailed from the Isle of Man to fight against Brian with the Leinster forces. However, after a disagreement, Brodir planned to kill Óspak and his men the next morning. Óspak and his soldiers then fled during the night with 10 ships and sailed around Ireland to Connacht, where Óspak converted to Christianity and swore allegiance to Brian. He fought on the opposite side to his brother at the battle.

Brian and Máel Sechnaill sent their forces to torch and plunder much of the countryside and hinterland north of Clontarf as far as the Howth Peninsula. However, in one of their raids, one of Máel Sechnaill&#x27;s sons, Flann, was killed when a raiding party he was leading was ambushed by the Norse, with a total of over 150 Irish killed.

A disagreement between Brian and Máel Sechnaill resulted in the latter withdrawing his support. Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad and ask him to return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late. To compound Brian&#x27;s problems, Máel Mórda&#x27;s Norse contingents, led by Sigurd Hlodvirsson, Earl of Orkney, and Brodir of the Isle of Man, arrived on Palm Sunday, 18 April. The battle occurred five days later, on Good Friday, 23 April 1014, just north of the city of Dublin, at Clontarf.


All of the accounts state that the Battle of Clontarf lasted all day, but this may be an exaggeration. The fighting was incredibly bloody by all accounts. Brian&#x27;s army, however, eventually broke the enemy line and the Vikings attempted to flee for their ships which were in the bay. However at this time the tide came in and many of them drowned attempting to swim for their ships as they were relentlessly pursued by the Irish.

Brian&#x27;s Irish army won partly through a small numerical advantage, and the use of small spears which they threw at the enemy. According to one account, Maél Sechnaill had a change of heart and arrived late to the battle and, after the death of Brian, led the Irish army and completed the rout.

Apart from Brian himself, much of the Irish royal bloodline was wiped out in the battle. The king&#x27;s son and heir, Murchad, was killed. According to one account he killed over 100 enemies, but the details of his own death are unknown. He died shortly after the Viking line broke.

Brian&#x27;s grandson and Murchad&#x27;s son Toirdelbach was also killed. Aged 15, he led the Irish infantry pursuing the Vikings as they fled to the sea. He was knocked over by a wave, knocking him unconscious after hitting his head, and he drowned.

On the Leinster and Viking side, many were also killed. Maél Morda was killed in the fighting. Sigurd the Stout of Orkney was also killed by Murchad. Brodir, who likely killed Brian, was captured and executed after the battle.

== Death ==
There are many accounts of how Brian was killed. Some suggest he was killed during heroic man-to-man combat, although others specify that he was not involved in the battle
due to his advanced age and frailty. According to the &quot;Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh&quot;, the elderly Brian Boru spent the day before his death away from combat, kneeling upon a cushion, and singing the Psalms, paters, aves, and other prayers using a Pater Noster cord. He was killed by fleeing Viking mercenaries shortly after learning from his attendant that, despite his forces having won a great victory, his son Murchadh&#x27;s standard had just fallen.

The most common accounts attribute the killing of Brian Boru to the Viking mercenary Brodir of the Isle of Man while praying in his tent at Clontarf. According to the 12th century &quot;Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib&quot;, Brian was visited in a dream on the night prior to the battle by a Pre-Christian goddess from the Irish mythology named Aibell. Aibell had been demoted since St Patrick to a Fairy Queen ruling over the Celtic Otherworld of Thomond and was traditionally considered the guardian spirit, protectress, and the banshee of King Brian&#x27;s clan and dynasty. In the dream, Aibell is said to have warned Brian of his impending death and further prophesied that whichever of his sons he saw first in the morning would succeed him. Believing that the dream predicted his destiny and also, it is implied, not wishing to outlive his son Murchadh, Brian refused to seek shelter from the retreating Vikings and even chose to dismiss his bodyguards at the critical moment.

The &quot;Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh&quot; alleges that when Brian Boru and Brodir came face to face, similarly to Hamlet and Laertes, all they accomplished was to kill each other. According to &quot;Njáls saga&quot;, on the other hand, Brodir was captured almost immediately afterwards and brutally tortured to death by Ulf the Quarrelsome, a bodyguard and possibly a relative through marriage of Brian and who was fiercely loyal to the late king. Brodir&#x27;s stomach was first slashed open with a sword, his intestines were then tied to a tree, and Brodir was forced to walk around and around the tree resulting in a slow and excruciating death from both blood loss and disembowelling.

After his death, Brian&#x27;s body was taken, as he had instructed moments before Brodir&#x27;s arrival, for his Requiem Mass to the church upon Spittal Hill, in what is now Swords, County Dublin and then to Armagh to be buried in the Cathedral founded by St Patrick. His tomb is said to be in the north wall of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in the city of Armagh.

There have been further reports that the body of Brian Boru was brought back to his homeland in Munster after his death. While passing an area named Graine, located outside Urlingford on the Leinster/Munster border, Brian&#x27;s army was attacked and his corpse was tied against a tree to pretend he was directing the army. In later years, artefacts—swords and clothing—strongly suggest that his army was in this area. Graine hill today has a wall which separates the two provinces and a narrow road still exists which used to be the main road connecting the diocese of Ossory and Cashel.

Brian was succeeded as High King of Ireland by his former enemy, and later ally, Máel Sechnaill (Malachy Mór), who regained the title which he had previously lost to Brian many years before. He ruled until his death in 1022.

==Historical view==
For the last 250 years there has been a debate among historians about Ireland&#x27;s Viking age and the Battle of Clontarf. The standard, and &quot;popular&quot;, view, is that the battle ended a war between the Irish and Vikings by which Brian Boru broke Viking power in Ireland. However, revisionist historians see it as an Irish civil war in which Brian Boru&#x27;s Munster and its allies defeated Leinster and Dublin, and that there were Vikings fighting on both sides. In January 2018 researchers from the Universities of Coventry, Oxford and Sheffield, led by Coventry University professor Ralph Kenna, a theoretical physicist, published a paper in the journal &quot;Royal Society Open Science&quot; that used network science to mathematically analyse the 12th-century &quot;Cogadh Gáedhel re Gallaibh&quot; (&quot;The War of the Gaels with the Foreigners&quot;, i.e. the Danes and other Norsemen), that listed over 1000 relationships between about 300 characters, and concluded that the standard and popular view of the war between the Irish and Germanic Norsemen was broadly correct, but that the picture was nevertheless more complex than &quot;a fully &#x27;clear-cut&#x27; Irish versus Viking conflict&quot;. However one of the paper&#x27;s co-authors, PhD student Joseph Yose, added that &quot;Our statistical analysis ... cannot decisively resolve the debate&quot;.

The revisionist theory is that the popular image of Brian—the ruler who managed to unify the regional leaders of Ireland so as to free the land from a &#x27;Danish&#x27; (Viking) occupation—originates from the powerful influence of the &quot;Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh&quot;, in which Brian takes the leading role. This work is thought to have been commissioned by Brian&#x27;s great-grandson Muirchertach Ua Briain as a means of justifying the Ua Briain claim to the High Kingship, a title upon which the Uí Neill had had a near-monopoly. Recent research has suggested that it might have been commissioned by Muirchertach&#x27;s contemporary and cousin, Brian Glinne Maidhir, or at least someone favourable to the line descended from Brian&#x27;s son, Donnchad.

The influence of this book on both scholarly and popular authors cannot be exaggerated. Until the 1970s most scholarly writing concerning the Vikings&#x27; activities in Ireland, as well as the career of Brian Boru, accepted the claims of &quot;Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh&quot; at face value.

While Brian may not have freed Ireland from a Norse (Viking) occupation, simply because it was never entirely conquered by the Vikings, his rule saw consistent conflict against Vikings and Viking-founded settlements, the latter all having been founded to give raiders easier access to the interior of Ireland. In the last decade of the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, beginning in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland&#x27;s first cities: Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, and Cork. Within only a few generations, some Norse had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and had often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians refer to as the Hiberno-Norse.

Such Hiberno-Norse cities occupied a tenuous position within Ireland&#x27;s political scene long before the birth of Brian. They often suffered attacks from Irish rulers, and made alliances with others. The Norse, who initially attacked and subsequently settled in Ireland, were partially assimilated by the Irish. However, Brian&#x27;s father was likely slain by the Norse of Limerick and he himself died during a revolt that was supported by multiple Viking leaders, specifically the Norse of Mann.

==Wives and children==
Brian&#x27;s first wife was Mór, daughter of the king of Uí Fiachrach Aidne of Connacht. She is said to have been the mother of his sons Murchad, Conchobar and Flann. Later genealogies claimed that these sons left no descendants, although in fact Murchad&#x27;s son Tairrdelbach is recorded as being killed at Clontarf along with his father and grandfather.

Another wife, Echrad, was a daughter of Carlus mac Ailella, king of Uí Áeda Odba, an obscure branch of the southern Uí Néill. She was the mother of Brian&#x27;s son Tadc, whose son Toirdelbach and grandson Muirchertach rivalled Brian in power and fame.

Brian&#x27;s most famous marriage was with Gormflaith, sister of Máel Mórda of Leinster. Donnchad, who had his half-brother Tadc killed in 1023 and ruled Munster for 40 years thereafter, was the result of this union.

Brian had a sixth son, Domnall. Although he predeceased his father, Domnall apparently had at least one surviving child, a son whose name is not recorded. Domnall may perhaps have been the son of Brian&#x27;s fourth known wife, Dub Choblaig, who died in 1009. She was a daughter of King Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg of Connacht.

Brian had at least three daughters, but their mothers are not recorded. Sadb, whose death in 1048 is recorded by the &quot;Annals of Innisfallen&quot;, was married to Cian, son of Máel Muad mac Brain. Bé Binn was married to the northern Uí Néill king Flaithbertach Ua Néill. A third daughter, Sláine, was married to Brian&#x27;s stepson Sigtrygg Silkbeard of Dublin.

According to &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot;, he had a foster-son named Kerthialfad.

==Family heritage==
The descendants of Brian were known as the Uí Briain (O&#x27;Brien) clan, hence the surnames Ó Briain, O&#x27;Brien, O&#x27;Brian etc. &quot;O&quot; was originally &#x27; which in turn came from &#x27;, which means &#x27;grandson or descendant&#x27; (of a named person). The prefix is often anglicised to &quot;O&#x27;&quot;, using an apostrophe instead of the Irish ( ´ ). The O&#x27;Briens subsequently ranked as one of the chief dynastic families of the country .

Brian&#x27;s third great-granddaughter was Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd (), Princess consort of Deheubarth in Wales, leader of the patriotic revolt and battle that contributed to the Great Revolt of 1136.
The Barons Inchiquin claim descent from Brian Boru, as did Sir Donough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Baronet.

===Literature===
&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; (1939), by James Joyce, makes multiple references to Brian Boru and Clontarf, in neologisms typical of that book (&quot;clontarfminded&quot;) and obscure references (e.g. &quot;as true as the Vernons have Brian&#x27;s sword&quot;—McHugh points out that the Vernons, an Italian family, had an ancient sword said to be Brian Boru&#x27;s).

In the 1949 novel &quot;Silverlock&quot; by John Myers Myers, the death of Brian Boru is described from the main character&#x27;s viewpoint.

Morgan Llywelyn&#x27;s &quot;Lion of Ireland&quot; (1980) is a historical novel about the life of Brian Boru.

Donal O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Sons of Death&quot; (1988), a historical novel about Brian Boru, is told from the point of view of MelPatrick, a young nobleman at Brian&#x27;s court. It uses the fictional device of the long-lost &quot;Brjánssaga&quot; as its source. It is the third in a series based on Irish history, beginning (vol. 1, &quot;Crucible&quot;; vol. 2 &quot;Of Gods and Men&quot;).

The story of Brian Boru&#x27;s final battle and death is told in Frank Delaney&#x27;s novel &quot;Ireland&quot; (2005).

Robert E. Howard wrote two versions of the Battle of Clontarf in 1931; a realistic historical novellette entitled &quot;The Spears of Clontarf&quot;, which he modified to include fantastic elements such as the appearance of the God Odin and retitled &quot;The Grey God Passes&quot;. &quot;The Cairn on the Headland&quot; is a sequel to the latter set in the present day.

===Music===

His name is remembered in the title of one of the oldest tunes in Ireland&#x27;s traditional repertoire: &quot;Brian Boru&#x27;s March&quot;. It is still widely played by many traditional Irish musicians. He was the subject of at least two operas: &quot;Brian Boroihme&quot; (1810) by Johann Bernhard Logier (1777–1846) and &quot;Brian Boru&quot; (1896) by Julian Edwards (1855–1910). His burial in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral is referenced in the song &quot;Boys from the County Armagh&quot; by Thomas P. Keenan (1866–1927). His exploits in battle serve as the inspiration for Irish folk metal band Cruachan&#x27;s song, &quot;Born for War (The Rise of Brian Boru)&quot;.

<text>Pitch is a perceptual property that allows sounds to be ordered on a frequency-related scale,
or more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; in the sense associated with musical melodies. 
Pitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.

Pitch may be quantified as a frequency, but pitch is not a purely objective physical property; it is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound. Historically, the study of pitch and pitch perception has been a central problem in psychoacoustics, and has been instrumental in forming and testing theories of sound representation, processing, and perception in the auditory system.

==Perception==

===Pitch and frequency===

Pitch is an auditory sensation in which a listener assigns musical tones to relative positions on a musical scale based primarily on their perception of the frequency of vibration (audio frequency). Pitch is closely related to frequency, but the two are not equivalent. Frequency is an objective, scientific attribute which can be measured. Pitch is the subjective perception of a sound wave by the individual person, which cannot be directly measured. However, this does not necessarily mean that people will not agree on which notes are higher and lower.

The oscillations of sound waves can often be characterized in terms of &quot;frequency&quot;. &quot;Pitches&quot; are usually associated with, and thus quantified as, &quot;frequencies&quot; (in cycles per second, or hertz), by comparing the sounds being assessed against sounds with pure tones (ones with periodic, sinusoidal waveforms). Complex and aperiodic sound waves can often be assigned a &quot;pitch&quot; by this method.

According to the American National Standards Institute, pitch is the auditory attribute of sound allowing those sounds to be ordered on a scale from low to high. Since pitch is such a close proxy for frequency, it is almost entirely determined by how quickly the sound wave is making the air vibrate and has almost nothing to do with the intensity, or amplitude, of the wave. That is, &quot;high&quot; pitch means very rapid oscillation, and &quot;low&quot; pitch corresponds to slower oscillation. Despite that, the idiom relating vertical height to sound pitch is shared by most languages. At least in English, it is just one of many deep conceptual metaphors that involve up/down. The exact etymological history of the musical sense of high and low pitch is still unclear. There is evidence that humans do actually perceive that the source of a sound is slightly higher or lower in vertical space when the sound frequency is increased or reduced.

In most cases, the pitch of complex sounds such as speech and musical notes corresponds very nearly to the repetition rate of periodic or nearly-periodic sounds, or to the reciprocal of the time interval between repeating similar events in the sound waveform.

The pitch of complex tones can be ambiguous, meaning that two or more different pitches can be perceived, depending upon the observer. When the actual fundamental frequency can be precisely determined through physical measurement, it may differ from the perceived pitch because of overtones, also known as upper partials, harmonic or otherwise. A complex tone composed of two sine waves of 1000 and 1200 Hz may sometimes be heard as up to three pitches: two spectral pitches at 1000 and 1200 Hz, derived from the physical frequencies of the pure tones, and the combination tone at 200 Hz, corresponding to the repetition rate of the waveform. In a situation like this, the percept at 200 Hz is commonly referred to as the missing fundamental, which is often the greatest common divisor of the frequencies present.

Pitch depends to a lesser degree on the sound pressure level (loudness, volume) of the tone, especially at frequencies below 1,000 Hz and above 2,000 Hz. The pitch of lower tones gets lower as sound pressure increases. For instance, a tone of 200 Hz that is very loud seems one semitone lower in pitch than if it is just barely audible. Above 2,000 Hz, the pitch gets higher as the sound gets louder. These results were obtained in the pioneering works by S. Stevens and W. Snow. Later investigations, e.g. by A. Cohen, have shown that in most cases the apparent pitch shifts were not significantly different from pitch‐matching errors. When averaged, the remaining shifts followed the directions of Stevens&#x27;s curves but were small (2% or less by frequency, i.e. not more than a semitone).
===Theories of pitch perception===

Theories of pitch perception try to explain how the physical sound and specific physiology of the auditory system work together to yield the experience of pitch. In general, pitch perception theories can be divided into place coding and temporal coding. Place theory holds that the perception of pitch is determined by the place of maximum excitation on the basilar membrane.

A place code, taking advantage of the tonotopy in the auditory system, must be in effect for the perception of high frequencies, since neurons have an upper limit on how fast they can phase-lock their action potentials. However, a purely place-based theory cannot account for the accuracy of pitch perception in the low and middle frequency ranges. Moreover, there is some evidence that some non-human primates lack auditory cortex responses to pitch despite having clear tonotopic maps in auditory cortex, showing that tonotopic place codes are not sufficient for pitch responses.

Temporal theories offer an alternative that appeals to the temporal structure of action potentials, mostly the phase-lock of action potentials to frequencies in a stimulus. The precise way this temporal structure helps code for pitch at higher levels is still debated, but the processing seems to be based on an autocorrelation of action potentials in the auditory nerve. However, it has long been noted that a neural mechanism that may accomplish a delay—a necessary operation of a true autocorrelation—has not been found. At least one model shows that a temporal delay is unnecessary to produce an autocorrelation model of pitch perception, appealing to phase shifts between cochlear filters; however, earlier work has shown that certain sounds with a prominent peak in their autocorrelation function do not elicit a corresponding pitch percept, and that certain sounds without a peak in their autocorrelation function nevertheless elicit a pitch. To be a more complete model, autocorrelation must therefore apply to signals that represent the output of the cochlea, as via auditory-nerve interspike-interval histograms. Some theories of pitch perception hold that pitch has inherent octave ambiguities, and therefore is best decomposed into a pitch &quot;chroma&quot;, a periodic value around the octave, like the note names in Western music—and a pitch &quot;height&quot;, which may be ambiguous, that indicates the octave the pitch is in.

===Just-noticeable difference===

The &quot;just-noticeable difference (jnd)&quot; (the threshold at which a change is perceived) depends on the tone&#x27;s frequency content. Below 500 Hz, the jnd is about 3 Hz for sine waves, and 1 Hz for complex tones; above 1000 Hz, the jnd for sine waves is about 0.6% (about 10 cents).
The jnd is typically tested by playing two tones in quick succession with the listener asked if there was a difference in their pitches. The jnd becomes smaller if the two tones are played simultaneously as the listener is then able to discern beat frequencies. The total number of perceptible pitch steps in the human hearing range is about 1,400; the total number of notes in the equal-tempered scale, from 16 to 16,000 Hz, is 120.

===Aural illusions===

The relative perception of pitch can be fooled, resulting in &quot;aural illusions&quot;. There are several of these, such as the tritone paradox, but most notably the Shepard scale, where a continuous or discrete sequence of specially formed tones can be made to sound as if the sequence continues ascending or descending forever.

==Definite and indefinite pitch== 

Not all musical instruments make notes with a clear pitch. The unpitched percussion instruments (a class of percussion instruments) do not produce particular pitches. A sound or note of definite pitch is one where a listener can possibly (or relatively easily) discern the pitch. Sounds with definite pitch have harmonic frequency spectra or close to harmonic spectra.

A sound generated on any instrument produces many modes of vibration that occur simultaneously. A listener hears numerous frequencies at once. The vibration with the lowest frequency is called the &quot;fundamental frequency&quot;; the other frequencies are &quot;overtones&quot;.
&quot;Harmonics&quot; are an important class of overtones with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental. Whether or not the higher frequencies are integer multiples, they are collectively called the partials, referring to the different parts that make up the total spectrum.

A sound or note of indefinite pitch is one that a listener finds impossible or relatively difficult to identify as to pitch. Sounds with indefinite pitch do not have harmonic spectra or have altered harmonic spectra—a characteristic known as inharmonicity.

It is still possible for two sounds of indefinite pitch to clearly be higher or lower than one another. For instance, a snare drum sounds higher pitched than a bass drum though both have indefinite pitch, because its sound contains higher frequencies. In other words, it is possible and often easy to roughly discern the relative pitches of two sounds of indefinite pitch, but sounds of indefinite pitch do not neatly correspond to any specific pitch.

==Pitch standards and standard pitch==

A pitch standard (also concert pitch) is the conventional pitch reference that musical instruments in a group are tuned to for a performance. Concert pitch may vary from ensemble to ensemble, and has varied widely over musical history.

Standard pitch is a more widely accepted convention. The A above middle C is usually set at 440 Hz (often written as &quot;A = 440 Hz&quot; or sometimes &quot;A440&quot;), although other frequencies, such as 442 Hz, are also often used as variants. Another standard pitch, the so-called &quot;Baroque pitch&quot;, has been set in the 20th century as A = 415 Hz—approximately an equal-tempered semitone lower than A440 to facilitate transposition. The &quot;Classical pitch&quot; can be set to either 427 Hz (about halfway between A415 and A440) or 430 Hz (also between A415 and A440 but slightly sharper than the quarter tone). And ensembles specializing in authentic performance set the A above middle C to 432 Hz or 435 Hz when performing repertoire from the Romantic era.

Transposing instruments have their origin in the variety of pitch standards. In modern times, they conventionally have their parts transposed into different keys from voices and other instruments (and even from each other). As a result, musicians need a way to refer to a particular pitch in an unambiguous manner when talking to each other.

For example, the most common type of clarinet or trumpet, when playing a note written in their part as C, sounds a pitch that is called B on a non-transposing instrument like a violin (which indicates that at one time these wind instruments played at a standard pitch a tone lower than violin pitch). To refer to that pitch unambiguously, a musician calls it &quot;concert B&quot;, meaning, &quot;the pitch that someone playing a non-transposing instrument like a violin calls B.&quot;

==Labeling pitches==

Pitches are labeled using:
* Letters, as in Helmholtz pitch notation 
* A combination of letters and numbers—as in scientific pitch notation, where notes are labelled upwards from C0, the 16 Hz C
* Numbers that represent the frequency in hertz (Hz), the number of cycles per second
For example, one might refer to the A above middle C as &quot;a′&quot;, &quot;A4&quot;, or &quot;440 Hz&quot;. In standard Western equal temperament, the notion of pitch is insensitive to &quot;spelling&quot;: the description &quot;G4 double sharp&quot; refers to the same pitch as &quot;A4&quot;; in other temperaments, these may be distinct pitches.
Human perception of musical intervals is approximately logarithmic with respect to fundamental frequency: the perceived interval between the pitches &quot;A220&quot; and &quot;A440&quot; is the same as the perceived interval between the pitches &quot;A440&quot; and &quot;A880&quot;. Motivated by this logarithmic perception, music theorists sometimes represent pitches using a numerical scale based on the logarithm of fundamental frequency. For example, one can adopt the widely used MIDI standard to map fundamental frequency, &quot;f&quot;, to a real number, &quot;p&quot;, as follows.
:formula_1
This creates a linear pitch space in which octaves have size 12, semitones (the distance between adjacent keys on the piano keyboard) have size 1, and A440 is assigned the number 69. (See Frequencies of notes.) Distance in this space corresponds to musical intervals as understood by musicians. An equal-tempered semitone is subdivided into 100 cents. The system is flexible enough to include &quot;microtones&quot; not found on standard piano keyboards. For example, the pitch halfway between C (60) and C (61) can be labeled 60.5.

The following table shows frequencies in Hertz for notes in various octaves, named according to the &quot;German method&quot; of octave nomenclature:

==Scales==

The relative pitches of individual notes in a scale may be determined by one of a number of tuning systems. In the west, the twelve-note chromatic scale is the most common method of organization, with equal temperament now the most widely used method of tuning that scale. In it, the pitch ratio between any two successive notes of the scale is exactly the twelfth root of two (or about 1.05946). In well-tempered systems (as used in the time of Johann Sebastian Bach, for example), different methods of musical tuning were used.

In almost all of these systems interval of the octave doubles the frequency of a note; for example, an octave above A440 is 880 Hz. If however the first overtone is sharp due to inharmonicity, as in the extremes of the piano, tuners resort to octave stretching.

==Other musical meanings of pitch==

In atonal, twelve tone, or musical set theory, a &quot;pitch&quot; is a specific frequency while a pitch class is all the octaves of a frequency. In many analytic discussions of atonal and post-tonal music, pitches are named with integers because of octave and enharmonic equivalency (for example, in a serial system, C and D are considered the same pitch, while C4 and C5 are functionally the same, one octave apart).

Discrete pitches, rather than continuously variable pitches, are virtually universal, with exceptions including &quot;tumbling strains&quot; and &quot;indeterminate-pitch chants&quot;. Gliding pitches are used in most cultures, but are related to the discrete pitches they reference or embellish.

<text>Kevin David Mitnick (August 6, 1963 – July 16, 2023) was an American computer security consultant, author, and convicted hacker. He is best known for his high-profile 1995 arrest and five years in prison for various computer and communications-related crimes.
Mitnick&#x27;s pursuit, arrest, trial and sentence were all controversial, as were the associated media coverage, books and films. After his release from prison, he ran his own security firm, Mitnick Security Consulting, LLC, and was also involved with other computer security businesses.

==Early life and education==
Mitnick was born on August 6, 1963, in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California. His father was Alan Mitnick, his mother was Shelly Jaffe, and his maternal grandmother was Reba Vartanian. Mitnick was Jewish, and grew up in Los Angeles, California. At age 12, Mitnick convinced a bus driver to tell him where he could buy his own ticket punch for &quot;a school project&quot;, and was then able to ride any bus in the greater Los Angeles area using unused transfer slips he found in a dumpster next to the bus company garage.

Mitnick attended James Monroe High School in North Hills, during which time he became a licensed amateur radio operator with callsign WA6VPS (his license was restored after imprisonment with callsign N6NHG). He chose the nickname &quot;Condor&quot; after watching the movie &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;. He was later enrolled at Los Angeles Pierce College and USC.

==Career==
For a time, Mitnick worked as a receptionist for Stephen S. Wise Temple in Los Angeles.

===Computer hacking===
Mitnick gained unauthorized access to a computer network in 1979, at 16, when a friend gave him the telephone number for the Ark, the computer system that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for developing its RSTS/E operating system software. He broke into DEC&#x27;s computer network and copied the company&#x27;s software, a crime for which he was charged and convicted in 1988. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Near the end of his supervised release, Mitnick hacked into Pacific Bell voicemail computers. After a warrant was issued for his arrest, Mitnick fled, becoming a fugitive for two-and-a-half years.

According to the United States Department of Justice, Mitnick gained unauthorized access to dozens of computer networks while he was a fugitive. He used cloned cellular phones to hide his location and, among other things, copied valuable proprietary software from some of the country&#x27;s largest cellular telephone and computer companies. Mitnick also intercepted and stole computer passwords, altered computer networks, and broke into and read private emails.

==== Arrest, conviction, and incarceration ====

After a well-publicized pursuit, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mitnick on February 15, 1995 at his apartment in Raleigh, North Carolina, on federal offenses related to a two-and-a-half-year period of computer hacking that included computer and wire fraud. He was found with cloned cell phones, more than 100 cloned cellular phone codes, and multiple pieces of false identification.

In December 1997, the Yahoo! Web site was hacked, displaying a message calling for Mitnick&#x27;s release. According to the message, all recent visitors of Yahoo!&#x27;s site had been infected with a computer worm that would wreak havoc on Christmas Day unless Mitnick was released. Yahoo! dismissed the claims as a hoax and said that the worm was nonexistent.

In 1998, Mitnick was charged in the United States District Court for the Central District of California with 14 counts of wire fraud, eight counts of possession of unauthorized access devices, interception of wire or electronic communications, unauthorized access to a federal computer, and causing damage to a computer. As part of a plea bargain, Mitnick pleaded guilty in 1999 to four counts of wire fraud, two counts of computer fraud, and one count of illegally intercepting a wire communication. U.S. district judge Mariana Pfaelzer sentenced Mitnick to 46 months in federal prison plus 22 months for violating the terms of his 1989 supervised release sentence for computer fraud. He admitted to violating the terms of supervised release by hacking into Pacific Bell voicemail and other systems and to associating with known computer hackers, in this case co-defendant Lewis De Payne. He was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, but it was not used as evidence because he pleaded guilty before going to trial. 

Mitnick served five years in prison—four-and-a-half years&#x27; pre-trial and eight months in solitary confinement, because, according to Mitnick, law enforcement officials convinced a judge that he had the ability to &quot;start a nuclear war by whistling into a pay phone&quot;, implying that law enforcement told the judge that he could somehow dial into the NORAD modem via a payphone from prison and communicate with the modem by whistling to launch nuclear missiles. In addition, a number of media outlets reported on the unavailability of kosher meals at the prison where he was incarcerated.

Mitnick was released from prison on January 21, 2000. During his supervised release period, which ended on January 21, 2003, he was initially forbidden to use any communications technology other than a landline telephone. Under the plea deal, Mitnick was also prohibited from profiting from films or books based on his criminal activity for seven years, under a variation of the Son of Sam law.

In December 2001, a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) judge ruled that Mitnick was sufficiently rehabilitated to possess a federally issued amateur radio license.

==== Controversy ====
Mitnick&#x27;s criminal activities, arrest, and trial, along with the associated journalism, were all controversial. Though Mitnick was convicted of copying software unlawfully, his supporters argue that his punishment was excessive and that many of the charges against him were fraudulent and not based on actual losses.

John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura, who had both been part of the pursuit of Mitnick, wrote the book &quot;Takedown&quot; about Mitnick&#x27;s capture.

The case against Mitnick tested the new laws that had been enacted for dealing with computer crime and it raised public awareness of security involving networked computers. The controversy remains and the Mitnick story is often cited today as an example of the influence of news media on law enforcement personnel.

=== Consulting ===
After his release in 2000, Mitnick became a paid security consultant, public speaker, and author. He carried out security consulting for, performed penetration testing services, and taught social engineering classes to companies and government agencies. He ran Mitnick Security Consulting LLC, a computer security consultancy and was part owner of KnowBe4, provider of an integrated platform for security awareness training and simulated phishing testing, as well as an active advisory board member at Zimperium, a firm that develops a mobile intrusion prevention system.
He resided in Las Vegas, Nevada.

== Death ==
Kevin Mitnick died from pancreatic cancer on July 16, 2023, at the age of 59 at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania hospital. At the time of his death, he was married and his wife, Kimberley Mitnick (age 36), was pregnant with their first child, a son.

== Media ==
In 2000, Skeet Ulrich and Russell Wong portrayed Mitnick and Tsutomu Shimomura, respectively, in the movie &quot;Track Down&quot; (known as &quot;Takedown&quot; outside the US), which was based on the book &quot;Takedown&quot; by John Markoff and Shimomura. The DVD was released in September 2004.

Mitnick also appeared in Werner Herzog&#x27;s documentary &quot;Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World&quot; (2016).

<text>Lughnasadh, Lughnasa or Lúnasa ( , ) is a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of the harvest season. Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man. Traditionally, it is held on 1 August, or about halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox. In recent centuries, some celebrations have shifted to Sundays near this date. Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals, along with Samhain, Imbolc, and Beltane. It corresponds to the Welsh and the English Lammas. 

Lughnasadh is mentioned in early Irish literature and has pagan origins. The festival is named after the god Lugh. In the Middle Ages, it involved great gatherings that included ceremonies, athletic contests (most notably the Tailteann Games), horse racing, feasting, matchmaking, and trading. According to folklorist Máire MacNeill, evidence suggests that the religious rites included an offering of the First Fruits, a feast of the new food, the sacrifice of a bull, and a ritual dance-play. In recent centuries, Lughnasadh gatherings have typically been held on top of hills and mountains, including many of the same activities.

The festival persisted widely until the 20th century, with the event being named &quot;Garland Sunday&quot;, &quot;Bilberry Sunday&quot;, &quot;Mountain Sunday&quot;, and &quot;Crom Dubh Sunday&quot;. The tradition of climbing hills and mountains at Lughnasadh has survived in some areas and is re-cast as a Christian pilgrimage. The best known is the Reek Sunday pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick on the last Sunday in July. Several fairs are also believed to be survivors of Lughnasadh, such as the Puck Fair. Since the late 20th century, Celtic neopagans have observed Lughnasadh, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. In some places, festival elements have been revived as a cultural event.

==Name==
In Old Irish the name was (). This is a combination of (the god Lugh) and (an assembly), which is unstressed when used as a suffix. Another theory is that it originated from the word &quot;nás&quot; (death), rather than &quot;násad&quot;. Later spellings include , and .

In Modern Irish, the spelling is , which is also the name for August. The genitive case is also as in (Month of August) and (Day of Lúnasa). In Modern Scottish Gaelic (), the festival and the month are both called . In Manx (), the festival and the month are both called . The day itself may be called either or .

In Welsh (), the day is known as , originally a Latin term, meaning the &quot;Calends of August&quot;. In Breton (), the day was known as , the &quot;Feast of August&quot;.

==Mythology and folklore==

In Irish mythology, Lughnasadh is said to have been founded by the god Lugh as a funeral feast and athletic competition—funeral games—to commemorate the death of an earth goddess. Irish myths about Lughnasadh and Lughnasadh sites tend to feature a woman who is carried off or held against her will, and who dies of grief, shame, exhaustion, or unspecified natural causes. Parallels with the Greek tale of Persephone have been noted. A story about the Lughnasadh site of Tailtin says the festival was founded by Lugh as funeral games in memory of his foster-mother Tailtiu. She was said to have died of exhaustion after clearing the plains of Ireland for agriculture. Tailtiu may have been an earth goddess who represented the dying vegetation that fed mankind. Another tale, about the assembly site of Naas, says that Lugh founded the festival in memory of his two wives, the sisters Nás and Bói. One theory is that it was a mourning (or wake) for the end of summer. 

Folklorist Máire MacNeill extensively studied the later folklore and traditions of Lughnasadh. She concludes that the main theme is a struggle for the harvest between two gods. One god, usually called Crom Dubh in later folklore, guards the grain as his treasure. The other god, Lugh, must seize it for mankind. Sometimes, this was portrayed as a struggle over a woman called Eithne, who represents the grain. Lugh also fights and defeats a figure representing blight. MacNeill says that these themes can be seen in earlier Irish mythology, particularly in the tale of Lugh defeating Balor, which seems to represent the overcoming of blight, drought and the scorching summer sun. In surviving folklore, Lugh is usually replaced by Saint Patrick, while Crom Dubh is a pagan chief who owns a granary or a bull and who opposes Patrick, but is overcome and converted. Crom Dubh is likely the same figure as Crom Cruach and shares some traits with the Dagda and Donn. He may be based on an underworld god like Hades and Pluto, who kidnaps the grain goddess Persephone but is forced to let her return to the world above before harvest time.

==Historic customs==
In the Middle Ages, the or (modern spelling: ) was held each Lughnasadh at Tailtin in what is now County Meath. According to medieval literature, kings attended this &quot;óenach&quot; and a truce was declared for its duration. It was similar to the Ancient Olympic Games and included ritual athletic and sporting contests, horse racing, music and storytelling, trading, proclaiming laws and settling legal disputes, drawing-up contracts, and matchmaking. At Tailtin, young couples entered into trial marriages by joining hands through a hole in a wooden door. The trial marriage lasted a year and a day, at which time it could be made permanent or broken without consequences. After the 9th century the was celebrated irregularly and it gradually died out. It was revived for a period in the 20th century as the Tailteann Games. Another Lughnasadh gathering, the , was held in what is now County Kildare. Carman is also believed to have been a goddess, perhaps one with a similar tale as Tailtiu. The included a food market, a livestock market, and a market for foreign traders. A 15th-century version of the Irish legend &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot; (&quot;the Wooing of Emer&quot;) is one of the earliest documents to record these festivities.

From the 18th century to the mid 20th century, many Lughnasadh customs and folklore were recorded. In 1962 &quot;The Festival of Lughnasa&quot;, a study of Lughnasadh by folklorist Máire MacNeill, was published. MacNeill studied surviving Lughnasadh customs and folklore as well as the earlier accounts and medieval writings about the festival. She concluded that the evidence testified to the existence of an ancient festival around 1 August that involved the following:

A solemn cutting of the first of the corn of which an offering would be made to the deity by bringing it up to a high place and burying it; a meal of the new food and of bilberries of which everyone must partake; a sacrifice of a sacred bull, a feast of its flesh, with some ceremony involving its hide, and its replacement by a young bull; a ritual dance-play perhaps telling of a struggle for a goddess and a ritual fight; an installation of a [carved stone] head on top of the hill and a triumphing over it by an actor impersonating Lugh; another play representing the confinement by Lugh of the monster blight or famine; a three-day celebration presided over by the brilliant young god [Lugh] or his human representative. Finally, a ceremony indicating that the interregnum was over, and the chief god in his right place again.

Many of the customs described by medieval writers survived into the modern era, though they were either Christianized or shorn of any pagan religious meaning. Lughnasadh occurred during a poor time of the year for the farming community when the old crops were done and the new ones not yet ready for harvest. Many of Ireland&#x27;s prominent mountains and hills were climbed at Lughnasadh. Some of the treks were re-cast as Christian pilgrimages, the most well-known being Reek Sunday – the yearly pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick in late July. Other hilltop gatherings were secular and attended mostly by the youth. On the Iveragh Peninsula, a pilgrimage to the summit of Drung Hill was part of local Lughnasadh celebrations until it died out around 1880. 

In Ireland, bilberries were gathered and there was eating, drinking, dancing, folk music, games and matchmaking, as well as athletic and sporting contests such as weight-throwing, hurling and horse racing. At some gatherings, everyone wore flowers while climbing the hill and then buried them at the summit as a sign that summer was ending. In other places, the first sheaf of the harvest was buried. There were also faction fights, whereby two groups of young men fought with sticks. In 18th-century Lothian, Scotland, rival groups of young men built towers of sods topped with a flag. For days, each group tried to sabotage the other&#x27;s tower, and at Lughnasadh they met each other in &#x27;battle&#x27;. 

Bull sacrifices at Lughnasadh time were recorded as late as the 18th century at Cois Fharraige in Ireland, where they were offered to Crom Dubh, and at Loch Maree in Scotland, where they were offered to Saint Máel Ruba. Special meals were made with the first produce of the harvest. In the Scottish Highlands, people made a special cake called the , which may have originated as an offering to the gods.

Another custom that Lughnasadh shared with Imbolc and Beltane was visiting holy wells, some specifically clootie wells. Visitors to these wells would pray for health while walking sunwise around the well; they would then leave offerings, typically coins or s. Although bonfires were lit at some of the open-air gatherings in Ireland, they were rare and incidental to the celebrations.

Traditionally, Lughnasadh has always been reckoned as the first day of August. In recent centuries, however, much of the gatherings and festivities shifted to the nearest Sundays – either the last Sunday in July or first Sunday in August. It is believed this is because the coming of the harvest was a busy time and the weather could be unpredictable, which meant work days were too important to give up. As Sunday would have been a day of rest anyway, it made sense to hold celebrations then. The festival may also have been affected by the shift to the Gregorian calendar.

Lughnasadh was a time of unpredictable weather in Ireland. Heavy rains known as &quot;Lammas floods&quot; often coincided with beginning of August and were responsible for destroying the corn. There are many folk sayings that relate to the unpredictable weather conditions during Lughnasadh and the importance of these conditions to the harvest:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;...For Lammas floods, with crops oft havoc play,
And e&#x27;en one swept the rustic bridge away.&quot;
&quot;August needs the dew as much as men need bread.
After Lammas corn ripens as much by night as by day.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

==Today==
In Ireland some of the mountain pilgrimages have survived. By far the most popular is the Reek Sunday pilgrimage at Croagh Patrick, which attracts tens of thousands of pilgrims each year.

The Puck Fair is held each year in early August in the town of Killorglin, County Kerry. It has been traced as far back as the 16th century but is believed to be a survival of a Lughnasadh festival. At the beginning of the three-day festival, a feral goat is brought into the town and crowned &quot;king&quot;, while a local girl is crowned &quot;queen&quot;. The festival includes traditional music and dancing, a parade, arts and crafts workshops, a horse and cattle fair, and a market. It draws a great number of tourists each year.

In recent years, other towns in Ireland have begun holding yearly Lughnasa Festivals and Lughnasa Fairs. Like the Puck Fair, these often include traditional music and dancing, arts and crafts workshops, traditional storytelling, and markets. Such festivals have been held in Gweedore, Sligo, Brandon, Rathangan and a number of other places. Craggaunowen, an open-air museum in County Clare, hosts a yearly Lughnasa Festival at which historical re-enactors demonstrate elements of daily life in Gaelic Ireland. It includes displays of replica clothing, artefacts, weapons and jewellery. A similar event has been held each year at Carrickfergus Castle in County Antrim. In 2011 RTÉ broadcast a &quot;Lughnasa Live&quot; television program from Craggaunowen.

In the Irish diaspora survivals of the Lughnasadh festivities are often seen by some families still choosing August as the traditional time for family reunions and parties, though due to modern work schedules these events have sometimes been moved to adjacent secular holidays, such as the Fourth of July in the United States.

The festival is referenced in the 1990 play &quot;Dancing at Lughnasa&quot; by Brian Friel, which was adapted into a 1998 film of the same name.

===Neopaganism===
Lughnasadh, or similar festivities based on it, is observed by some modern Pagans in general and Celtic neopagans in particular. Despite their common name, such Lughnasadh celebrations can differ widely. Some attempt to emulate the historic festival as much as possible, while others (such as Wiccans) base their celebrations on various festivals, the Gaelic festival being only one of them.

Neopagans usually celebrate Lughnasadh on 1 August in the Northern Hemisphere and 1 February in the Southern Hemisphere, often beginning their festivities at sunset the evening before. Some neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the summer solstice and autumn equinox, or the full moon nearest this point. In 2022, this astronomical midpoint falls on 7 August (Northern hemisphere) or 4 February (Southern hemisphere).

====Celtic Reconstructionist====
Celtic Reconstructionist pagans strive to reconstruct ancient Celtic religion. Their practices are based on research and historical accounts, but may be modified slightly to suit modern life. They avoid syncretic or eclectic approaches that combine traditions from different cultures.

Celtic Reconstructionists who follow Gaelic traditions tend to celebrate at the time of &quot;first fruits&quot;, or on the full moon nearest this time. In the Northeastern United States, this is often the time of the blueberry harvest, while in the Pacific Northwest the blackberries are often the festival fruit. In Celtic Reconstructionism, is seen as a time to give thanks to the spirits and deities for the beginning of the harvest season, and to propitiate them with offerings and prayers not to harm the still-ripening crops. The god is honoured by many at this time, and gentle rain on the day of the festival is seen as his presence and his bestowing of blessings. Many Celtic Reconstructionists also honour the goddess Tailtiu at , and may seek to keep the from damaging the crops, much in the way appeals are made to .

====Wicca====
Wiccans use the names &quot;Lughnasadh&quot; or &quot;Lammas&quot; for the first of their autumn harvest festivals. It is one of the eight yearly &quot;Sabbats&quot; of their Wheel of the Year, following Midsummer and preceding Mabon. It is seen as one of the two most auspicious times for handfasting, the other being at Beltane. Some Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the &quot;corn god&quot; in bread, and then symbolically sacrificing and eating it.

<text>The University of North Carolina is the public university system for the state of North Carolina. Overseeing the state&#x27;s 16 public universities and the NC School of Science and Mathematics, it is commonly referred to as the UNC System to differentiate it from its first campus, UNC-Chapel Hill.

The university system has a total enrollment of 244,507 students as of fall 2021. UNC campuses conferred 62,930 degrees in 2020–2021, the bulk of which were at the bachelor&#x27;s level, with 44,309 degrees awarded. In 2008, the UNC System conferred over 75% of all baccalaureate degrees in North Carolina.

== History ==

=== Foundations ===
Founded in 1789, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (at the time called the University of North Carolina) is one of three schools to claim the title of oldest public university in the United States. It closed from 1871 to 1875, faced with serious financial and enrollment problems during the Reconstruction era. In 1877, the state of North Carolina began sponsoring additional higher education institutions. Over time, the state added a women&#x27;s college (now known as the University of North Carolina at Greensboro), a land-grant university (North Carolina State University), five historically black institutions (North Carolina A&amp;T State University, North Carolina Central University, Winston-Salem State University, Fayetteville State University, and Elizabeth City State University) and one to educate American Indians (the University of North Carolina at Pembroke). Others were created to prepare teachers for public education and to instruct performing artists.

=== Initial Consolidation ===
During the Great Depression, the North Carolina General Assembly searched for cost savings within state government. Towards this effort in 1931, it redefined the University of North Carolina, which at the time referred exclusively to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; the new &quot;Consolidated University of North Carolina&quot; was created to include the existing campuses of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina State College (now North Carolina State University), and the Woman&#x27;s College (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro). The three campuses came under the leadership of a single board of trustees and a single president, with &quot;Deans of Administration&quot; serving as day-to-day leaders of the three campuses. In 1945, the title &quot;Dean of Administration&quot; was changed to &quot;Chancellor.&quot; By 1969, three additional campuses had joined the Consolidated University through legislative action: the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, the University of North Carolina at Asheville, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.

=== 1971 to present ===
In 1971, North Carolina passed legislation bringing into the University of North Carolina all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor&#x27;s degrees. This latest round of consolidation gave each constituent school its own chancellor and board of trustees. In 1985, the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, the nation&#x27;s first public residential high school for gifted students, was declared an affiliated school of the university. In 2007, the high school became a full member of the university.

=== Presidents ===

An asterisk (*) denotes acting president.
Two asterisks (**) denotes chairman of the faculty.

== Legal mandate ==

The legal authority and mandate for the University of North Carolina is contained in the State&#x27;s first Constitution (1776), which provided in Article XLI
That a school or schools shall be established by the Legislature, for the convenient instruction of youth, ... and all useful learning shall be duly encouraged, and promoted, in one or more universities,
The state legislature granted a charter and funding for the university in 1789.

Article IX of the 1971 North Carolina Constitution deals with all forms of public education in the state. Sections 8 and 9 of that article address higher education.
* Sec. 8. Higher education.
The General Assembly shall maintain a public system of higher education, comprising The University of North Carolina and such other institutions of higher education as the General Assembly may deem wise. The General Assembly shall provide for the selection of trustees of The University of North Carolina and of the other institutions of higher education, in whom shall be vested all the privileges, rights, franchises, and endowments heretofore granted to or conferred upon the trustees of these institutions. The General Assembly may enact laws necessary and expedient for the maintenance and management of The University of North Carolina and the other public institutions of higher education.

* Sec. 9. Benefits of public institutions of higher education.
The General Assembly shall provide that the benefits of The University of North Carolina and other public institutions of higher education, as far as practicable, be extended to the people of the State free of expense.

Statutory provisions stipulate the current function and cost to students of the University of North Carolina.

== Institutions ==
Within its seventeen campuses, UNC houses two medical schools and one teaching hospital, ten nursing programs, two schools of dentistry, one veterinary school and hospital, and a school of pharmacy, as well as a two law schools, 15 schools of education, three schools of engineering, and a school for performing artists. The oldest university, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, first admitted students in 1795. The smallest and newest member is the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, a residential two-year high school, founded in 1980 and a full member of the university since 2007. The largest university is North Carolina State University, with 37,323 students as of fall 2023.

While the official names of each campus are determined by the North Carolina General Assembly, abbreviations are determined by the individual school.

===Notes===
The enrollment numbers are the official headcounts (including all full-time and part-time, undergrad and postgrad students) from University of North Carolina website. This does not include the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, the figure for NCSSM is taken from its own website.

The following universities became four-year institutions after their founding (date each became a four-year institution in parentheses):
*East Carolina University (1920)
*North Carolina Central University (1925)
*Winston-Salem State University (1925) 
*Western Carolina University (1929)
*Appalachian State University (1929)
*Elizabeth City State University (1937)
*University of North Carolina at Pembroke (1939)
*Fayetteville State University (1939)
*University of North Carolina at Asheville (1963)
*University of North Carolina at Charlotte (1963)
*University of North Carolina at Wilmington (1963)

With the exception of the University of North Carolina at Pembroke and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, the institutions that joined the University of North Carolina in 1972 did so under their current name. As of 1972, all public four-year institutions in North Carolina are members of the university.

<doc id="77944" wikidata="Q165938" url="?curid=77944" title="Hesperides">
<text>In Greek mythology, the Hesperides (; , ) are the nymphs of evening and golden light of sunsets, who were the &quot;Daughters of the Evening&quot; or &quot;Nymphs of the West&quot;. They were also called the Atlantides () from their reputed father, Atlas.

== Etymology ==
The name means &quot;originating from Hesperos&quot; (evening). &quot;Hesperos&quot;, or &quot;Vesper&quot; in Latin, is the origin of the name Hesperus, the evening star (i.e. the planet Venus) as well as having a shared root with the English word &quot;west&quot;.

== Mythology ==
=== The nymphs of the evening ===
Ordinarily, the Hesperides number three, like the other Greek triads (the Three Graces and the Three Fates). &quot;Since the Hesperides themselves are mere symbols of the gifts the apples embody, they cannot be actors in a human drama. Their abstract, interchangeable names are a symptom of their impersonality&quot;, classicist Evelyn Byrd Harrison has observed.

They are sometimes portrayed as the evening daughters of Night (Nyx), either alone, or with Darkness (Erebus), in accord with the way Eos in the farthermost east, in Colchis, is the daughter of the titan Hyperion. The Hesperides are also listed as the daughters of Atlas and Hesperis, or of Phorcys and Ceto, or of Zeus and Themis. In a Roman literary source, the nymphs are simply said to be the daughters of Hesperus, embodiment of the &quot;west&quot;.

Nevertheless, among the names given to them, though never all at once, there were either three, four, or seven Hesperides. Apollonius of Rhodes gives the number of three with their names as Aigle, Erytheis, and Hespere (or Hespera). Hyginus in his preface to the &quot;Fabulae&quot; names them as Aegle, Hesperie, and Aerica. In another source, they are named Aegle, Arethusa, and Hesperethusa, the three daughters of Hesperus.

Hesiod says that these &quot;clear-voiced Hesperides&quot;, daughters of Ceto and Phorcys, guarded the golden apples beyond Ocean in the far west of the world, gives the number of the Hesperides as four, and their names as: Aigle (or Aegle, &quot;dazzling light&quot;), Erytheia (or Erytheis), Hesperia (&quot;sunset glow&quot;) whose name refers to the colour of the setting sun, red, yellow, or gold; and lastly Arethusa. In addition, Hesperia, and Arethusa, the so-called &quot;ox-eyed Hesperethusa&quot;. Apollodorus gives the number of the Hesperides also as four, namely: Aigle, Erytheia, Hesperia (or Hesperie), and Arethusa while Fulgentius named them as Aegle, Hesperie, Medusa, and Arethusa. However, the historiographer Diodorus in his account stated that they are seven in number with no information of their names. An ancient vase painting attests the following names as four: Asterope, Chrysothemis, Hygieia, and Lipara; on another seven names as Aiopis, Antheia, Donakis, Calypso, Mermesa, Nelisa, and Tara. A pyxis has Hippolyte, Mapsaura, and Thetis. Petrus Apianus attributed to these stars a mythical connection of their own. He believed that they were the seven Hesperides, nymph daughters of Atlas and Hesperis. Their names were: Aegle, Erythea, Arethusa, Hestia, Hespera, Hesperusa, and Hespereia. A certain Crete, possible eponym of the island of Crete, was also called one of the Hesperides.

They are sometimes called the &quot;Western Maidens&quot;, the &quot;Daughters of Evening&quot;, or &quot;Erythrai&quot;, and the &quot;Sunset Goddesses&quot;, designations all apparently tied to their imagined location in the distant west. Hesperis is appropriately the personification of the evening (as Eos is of the dawn) and the Evening Star is Hesperus.

In addition to their tending of the garden, they have taken great pleasure in singing. Euripides calls them &quot;minstrel maids&quot; as they possess the power of sweet song. The Hesperides could be hamadryad nymphs or epimeliads as suggested by a passage in which they change into trees: &quot;... Hespere became a poplar and Eretheis an elm, and Aegle a willow&#x27;s sacred trunk ...&quot; and in the same account, they are described figuratively or literally to have white arms and golden heads.

Erytheia (&quot;the red one&quot;) is one of the Hesperides. The name was applied to an island close to the coast of southern Hispania, which was the site of the original Punic colony of Gades (modern Cadiz). Pliny&#x27;s Natural History (VI.36) records of the island of Gades:

The island was the home of Geryon, who was overcome by Heracles.
=== Land of Hesperides ===
The Hesperides tend a blissful garden in a far western corner of the world, located near the Atlas mountains in North Africa at the edge of the encircling Oceanus the world ocean. According to Pliny the Elder, the garden was located at Lixus, Morocco, which was also the location where Heracles fought against Antaeus.

According to the Sicilian Greek poet Stesichorus, in his poem the &quot;Song of Geryon&quot;, and the Greek geographer Strabo, in his book &quot;Geographika&quot; (volume III), the garden of the Hesperides is located in Tartessos, a location placed in the south of the Iberian peninsula.

Euesperides (in modern-day Benghazi) which was probably founded by people from Cyrene or Barca, from both of which it lies to the west, might have mythological associations with the garden of Hesperides.

By Ancient Roman times, the garden of the Hesperides had lost its archaic place in religion and had dwindled to a poetic convention, in which form it was revived in Renaissance poetry, to refer both to the garden and to the nymphs that dwelt there.

=== The Garden of the Hesperides ===
The Garden of the Hesperides is Hera&#x27;s orchard in the west, where either a single apple tree or a grove grows, producing golden apples. According to the legend, when the marriage of Zeus and Hera took place, the different deities came with nuptial presents for the latter, and among them the goddess Gaia, with branches having golden apples growing on them as a wedding gift. Hera, greatly admiring these, begged of Gaia to plant them in her gardens, which extended as far as Mount Atlas.

The Hesperides were given the task of tending to the grove, but occasionally picked apples from it themselves. Not trusting them, Hera also placed in the garden an immortal, never-sleeping, hundred-headed dragon named Ladon as an additional safeguard. In the myth of the Judgement of Paris, it was from the Garden that Eris, Goddess of Discord, obtained the Apple of Discord, which led to the Trojan War.

In later years it was thought that the &quot;golden apples&quot; might have actually been oranges, a fruit unknown to Europe and the Mediterranean before the Middle Ages. Under this assumption, the Greek botanical name chosen for all citrus species was &quot;Hesperidoeidē&quot; (Ἑσπεριδοειδῆ, &quot;hesperidoids&quot;) and even today the Greek word for the orange fruit is πορτοκάλι (Portokáli)--after the country of Portugal in Iberia near where the Garden of the Hesperides grew.

=== The Eleventh Labour of Heracles ===


After Heracles completed his first ten Labours, Eurystheus gave him two more claiming that neither the Hydra counted (because Iolaus helped Heracles) nor the Augean stables (either because he received payment for the job or because the rivers did the work). The first of these two additional Labours was to steal the apples from the garden of the Hesperides. Heracles first caught the Old Man of the Sea, the shape-shifting sea god, to learn where the Garden of the Hesperides was located. In some versions of the tale, Heracles went to the Caucasus, where Prometheus was confined. The Titan directed him concerning his course through the land of the peoples in the farthest north and the perils to be encountered on his homeward march after slaying Geryon in the farthest west.

Follow this straight road; and, first of all, thou shalt come to the Boreades, where do thou beware the roaring hurricane, lest unawares it twist thee up and snatch thee away in wintry whirlwind.

As payment, Heracles freed Prometheus from his daily torture. This tale is more usually found in the position of the Erymanthian Boar, since it is associated with Chiron choosing to forgo immortality and taking Prometheus&#x27; place.

Another story recounts how Heracles, either at the start or at the end of his task, meets Antaeus, who was immortal as long as he touched his mother, Gaia, the earth. Heracles killed Antaeus by holding him aloft and crushing him in a bearhug. Herodotus claims that Heracles stopped in Egypt, where King Busiris decided to make him the yearly sacrifice, but Heracles burst out of his chains.

Finally making his way to the Garden of the Hesperides, Heracles tricked Atlas into retrieving some of the golden apples for him, by offering to hold up the heavens for a little while (Atlas was able to take them as, in this version, he was the father or otherwise related to the Hesperides). This would have made this task – like the Hydra and Augean stables – void because he had received help. Upon his return, Atlas decided that he did not want to take the heavens back, and instead offered to deliver the apples himself, but Heracles tricked him again by agreeing to take his place on condition that Atlas relieve him temporarily so that Heracles could make his cloak more comfortable. Atlas agreed, but Heracles reneged and walked away, carrying the apples. According to an alternative version, Heracles slew Ladon instead and stole the apples.

There is another variation to the story where Heracles was the only person to steal the apples, other than Perseus, although Athena later returned the apples to their rightful place in the garden. They are considered by some to be the same &quot;apples of joy&quot; that tempted Atalanta, as opposed to the &quot;apple of discord&quot; used by Eris to start a beauty contest on Olympus (which caused &quot;The Siege of Troy&quot;).

On Attic pottery, especially from the late fifth century, Heracles is depicted sitting in bliss in the Gardens of the Hesperides, attended by the maidens.

=== Argonauts&#x27; encounter ===
After the hero Heracles killed Ladon and stole the golden apples, the Argonauts during their journey, came to the Hesperian plain the next day. The band of heroes asked for the mercy of the Hesperides to guide them to a source of water in order to replenish their thirst. The goddesses pitying the young men, directed them to a spring created by Heracles who likewise longing for a draught while wandering the land, smote a rock near Lake Triton after which the water gushed out. The following passage recounts this meeting of the Argonauts and the nymphs:

Then, like raging hounds, they [i.e. Argonauts] rushed to search for a spring; for besides their suffering and anguish, a parching thirst lay upon them, and not in vain did they wander; but they came to the sacred plain where Ladon, the serpent of the land, till yesterday kept watch over the golden apples in the garden of Atlas; and all around the nymphs, the Hesperides, were busied, chanting their lovely song. But at that time, stricken by Heracles, he lay fallen by the trunk of the apple-tree; only the tip of his tail was still writhing; but from his head down his dark spine he lay lifeless; and where the arrows had left in his blood the bitter gall of the Lernaean hydra, flies withered and died over the festering wounds. And close at hand the Hesperides, their white arms flung over their golden heads, lamented shrilly; and the heroes drew near suddenly; but the maidens, at their quick approach, at once became dust and earth where they stood. Orpheus marked the divine portent, and for his comrades addressed them in prayer: &quot;O divine ones, fair and kind, be gracious, O queens, whether ye be numbered among the heavenly goddesses, or those beneath the earth, or be called the Solitary nymphs; come, O nymphs, sacred race of Oceanus, appear manifest to our longing eyes and show us some spring of water from the rock or some sacred flow gushing from the earth, goddesses, wherewith we may quench the thirst that burns us unceasingly. And if ever again we return in our voyaging to the Achaean land, then to you among the first of goddesses with willing hearts will we bring countless gifts, libations and banquets.
So he spake, beseeching them with plaintive voice; and they from their station near pitied their pain; and lo! First of all they caused grass to spring from the earth; and above the grass rose up tall shoots, and then flourishing saplings grew standing upright far above the earth. Hespere became a poplar and Eretheis an elm, and Aegle a willow&#x27;s sacred trunk. And forth from these trees their forms looked out, as clear as they were before, a marvel exceeding great, and Aegle spake with gentle words answering their longing looks: &quot;Surely there has come hither a mighty succour to your toils, that most accursed man, who robbed our guardian serpent of life and plucked the golden apples of the goddesses and is gone; and has left bitter grief for us. For yesterday came a man most fell in wanton violence, most grim in form; and his eyes flashed beneath his scowling brow; a ruthless wretch; and he was clad in the skin of a monstrous lion of raw hide, untanned; and he bare a sturdy bow of olive, and a bow, wherewith he shot and killed this monster here. So he too came, as one traversing the land on foot, parched with thirst; and he rushed wildly through this spot, searching for water, but nowhere was he like to see it. Now here stood a rock near the Tritonian lake; and of his own device, or by the prompting of some god, he smote it below with his foot; and the water gushed out in full flow. And he, leaning both his hands and chest upon the ground, drank a huge draught from the rifted rock, until, stooping like a beast of the field, he had satisfied his mighty maw.
Thus she spake; and they gladly with joyful steps ran to the spot where Aegle had pointed out to them the spring, until they reached it. And as when earth-burrowing ants gather in swarms round a narrow cleft, or when flies lighting upon a tiny drop of sweet honey cluster round with insatiate eagerness; so at that time, huddled together, the Minyae thronged about the spring from the rock. And thus with wet lips one cried to another in his delight: &quot;Strange! In very truth Heracles, though far away, has saved his comrades, fordone with thirst. Would that we might find him on his way as we pass through the mainland!

=== Variation of the myth ===
According to Diodorus&#x27; account, the Hesperides did not have the golden apples. Instead they possessed flocks of sheep which excelled in beauty and were therefore called for their beauty, as the poets might do, &quot;golden apples&quot;, just as Aphroditê is called &quot;golden&quot; because of her loveliness. Others also say that it was because the sheep had a peculiar colour like gold that they got this designation. This version further states that Dracon (&quot;dragon&quot;) was the name of the shepherd of the sheep, a man who excelled in strength of body and courage, who guarded the sheep and slew any who might dare to carry them off.

== In the Renaissance ==
With the revival of classical allusions in the Renaissance, the Hesperides returned to their prominent position, and the garden itself took on the name of its nymphs: Robert Greene wrote of &quot;The fearful Dragon... that watched the garden called Hesperides&quot;. Shakespeare inserted the comically insistent rhyme &quot;is not Love a Hercules, Still climbing trees in the Hesperides&quot; in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot; (iv.iii) and John Milton mentioned the &quot;ladies of the Hesperides&quot; in &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; (ii.357). &quot;Hesperides&quot; (published 1647) was the title of a collection of pastoral and religious verse by the Royalist poet Robert Herrick.

<text>Aegle ( &quot;brightness&quot; or &quot;dazzling light&quot;) is the name of several different figures in Greek mythology:
*Aegle, one of the daughters of Asclepius. Her name is said to have derived from &quot;Αἴγλη&quot; (&quot;Aegle&quot;), meaning &quot;Brightness,&quot; or &quot;Splendor,&quot; either from the beauty of the human body when in good health, or from the honor paid to the medical profession.
*Aegle, the most beautiful of the Naiads, daughter of Zeus and Neaera, by whom Helios begot the Charites.
*Aegle, one of the Heliades, a sister of Phaeton, and daughter of Helios and Clymene. In her grief at the death of her brother she and her sisters were changed into poplars.
*Aegle, one of the Hesperides.
*Aegle, another name of Coronis, daughter of Phlegyas and lover of Apollo.
*Aegle, was a daughter of Panopeus, the Phocian hero. She was said to be one who was beloved by Theseus, and for whom he forsook Ariadne.
* Aegle, nurse of Dionysus

<text>Erytheia or Erythia () (&quot;the red one&quot;), part of Greek mythology, is one of the three Hesperides. The name was applied to the island close to the coast of southern Hispania, that was the site of the original Punic colony of Gadeira. Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (4.36) records of the island of Gades: &quot;On the side which looks towards Spain, at about 100 paces distance, is another long island, three miles wide, on which the original city of Gades stood. By Ephorus and Philistides it is called Erythia, by Timæus and Silenus Aphrodisias, and by the natives the Isle of Juno.&quot; The island was the seat of Geryon, who was overcome by Heracles. Erytheia was also the place where, according to one account, the sun god Helios kept his sacred cattle when the Giant Alcyoneus stole them during the Gigantomachy.

<text>A &#x27; (; , plural &#x27; ), also called a &#x27; (, plural &#x27; or  ), or &quot;mortmain&quot; property, is an inalienable charitable endowment under Islamic law. It typically involves donating a building, plot of land or other assets for Muslim religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets. A charitable trust may hold the donated assets. The person making such dedication is known as a (&#x27;donor&#x27;) who uses a &quot;mutawalli&quot; (&#x27;trustee&#x27;) to manage the property in exchange for a share of the revenues it generates. A waqf allows the state to provide social services in accordance with Islamic law while contributing to the preservation of cultural and historical sites. Although the system depended on several hadiths and presented elements similar to practices from pre-Islamic cultures, it seems that the specific full-fledged Islamic legal form of endowment called dates from the 9th century AD (see below).

==Terminology==

In Sunni jurisprudence, , also spelled (; plural , ; ) is synonymous with (, also called or and commonly rendered in French). &quot;Habs&quot; and similar terms are used mainly by Maliki jurists. In Twelver Shiism, is a particular type of , in which the founder reserves the right to dispose of the property. The person making the grant is called (or ) while the endowed assets are called (or ).

In older English-language law-related works in the late 19th/early 20th centuries, the word used for was &quot;vakouf&quot;; the word, also present in such French works, was used during the time of the Ottoman Empire, and is from the Turkish .

==Definition==
The term literally means &#x27;confinement and prohibition&#x27;, or causing a thing to stop or stand still. According to Islamic law, once an asset has been donated as &quot;waqf&quot; it cannot be sold, transferred or given as a gift. Once a &quot;waqif&quot; has verbally or in writing declared a &quot;waqf&quot; property, it is legally conceived as the property of Allah and must be used to &quot;fulfill public of family needs&quot; as a charitable social service. A &quot;waqf&quot; property can fall into one of two categories: movable or immovable. A &#x27;movable&#x27; asset includes money or shares which are used to finance educational, religious or cultural institutions such as &quot;madrasahs&quot; (Islamic schools) or &quot;mosques&quot;. The &quot;madrasahs&quot; and &quot;mosques&quot; themselves are an example of an &#x27;immovable&#x27; asset which refers to land or structures open for public use. An important function of the latter is also to provide shelter and community spaces to the poor, also known as the &quot;mawquf &#x27;alayh&quot; (beneficiaries). 

Bahaeddin Yediyıldız defines as a system comprising three elements: , , and . , the plural form of , means &#x27;goodnesses&#x27; and refers to the motivational factor behind the organization; refers to corpus and literally means &#x27;real estates,&#x27; implying revenue-generating sources such as markets (, , , etc.), land, and baths; and , in its narrow sense, is the institution(s) providing services as committed in the deed, such as , public kitchens (), , mosques, libraries, etc.

Generally, the must fulfill three primary constraints:
# The one endowing the , and its subsequent maintainers, should sequester the principal and allocate the proceeds to charity.
# The endowment should legally be removed from commodification, such that it is no longer on the market.
# Its sole purpose must be charitable, and the beneficiary group must be named.

==Origin in Islamic texts==
Although there is no direct Quranic injunction regarding , it can be inferred from Surah Al-i&#x27;-Imran (3:92): &quot;You will never achieve righteousness until you donate some of what you cherish. And whatever you give is certainly well known to Allah.&quot; Their formal conception in Islamic society has been derived from a number of hadiths. It is said that during the time of Muhammad, after the Hijrah, the first was composed of a grove of 600 date palms. The proceeds of this were meant to feed Medina&#x27;s poor.

In one tradition, it is said that: &quot;Ibn Umar reported, Umar Ibn Al-Khattab got land in Khaybar, so he came to Muhammad and asked him to advise him about it. Muhammad said, &#x27;If you like, make the property inalienable and give the profit from it to charity.&#x27; It goes on to say that Umar gave it away as alms, that the land itself would not be sold, inherited, or donated. He gave it away for the poor, the relatives, the slaves, the jihad, the travelers, and the guests. It will not be held against him who administers it if he consumes some of its yield in an appropriate manner or feeds a friend who does not enrich himself by means of it.&quot;

In another hadith, Muhammad said, &quot;When a man dies, only three deeds will survive him: continuing alms, profitable knowledge, and a child praying for him.&quot;

== Life cycle ==

=== Founding ===

Islamic law places several legal conditions on the process of establishing a .

==== Founder ====

A is a contract; therefore, the founder (called or in Arabic) must be capable of entering into a contract. For this, the founder must:
* be an adult
* be sound of mind
* be capable of handling financial affairs
* not be under interdiction for bankruptcy

Although is an Islamic institution, being a Muslim is not required to establish a , and may establish a . Finally, if a person is fatally ill, the is subject to the same restrictions as a will in Islam.

=== Characteristics of a waqf ===

* The waqf must be established by someone who is legally capable of disposing of their property, which means they must be an adult of sound mind and a responsible person. It cannot be done by a minor, an insane person, or someone lacking legal capacity.
* The person establishing the waqf (the waqif) must designate a specific beneficiary or recipient for the waqf, such as a mosque, a specific individual, or an institution. It cannot be left in his or her discretion.
* The waqf should not be subject to any conditions, hanging or temporary clauses, or be contingent on certain events, like the option to revoke it.
* The waqif (the one establishing the waqf) should not include any conditions that are contrary to the essential conditions, like a condition that allows them to sell or gift the endowed property whenever they wish, or a condition that grants them personal choice or discretion over it. 
* The waqf should be of a virtuous and moral nature, reflecting what is ethical and righteous, and it should not support or be associated with corrupt or unethical activities. It should be established with the intention of promoting goodness and benefiting society.
* The property being endowed in the waqf should either be owned by the waqif (the person establishing the waqf) or acquired with the waqif&#x27;s own funds. It should not involve borrowed money or property that the waqif does not own outright.

==== Waqfiyya (endowment document) ====
Each waqf is supposed to be recorded in an endowment deed, called a waqfiyya. Waqfiyyas follow &quot;Islamic legal and fiscal-geographical conventions.&quot; They include the names of the property, the endowed fraction (in 24–qarats), and additional descriptions, most often delimitation of their boundary. 

==== Women&#x27;s contribution to the system ====

Some of the founders of Ottoman were women, with their establishments having a crucial impact on their communities&#x27; economic life. Out of 30,000 certificates documented by the GDPFA (General Directorate of Pious Foundation in Ankara), over 2,300 of them were registered to institutions that belonged to women. Of the 491 public fountains in Istanbul that were constructed during the Ottoman period and survived until the 1930s, nearly 30% of them were registered under that belonged to women.

==== Property ====

The property (called or ) used to found a must be objects of a valid contract. The objects should not themselves be haram (e.g. wine or pork). These objects should not already be in the public domain: public property cannot be used to establish a waqf. The founder cannot also have pledged the property previously to someone else. These conditions are generally true for contracts in Islam.

The property dedicated to is generally immovable, such as an estate. All movable goods can also form , according to most Islamic jurists. The Hanafis, however, also allow most movable goods to be dedicated to a with some restrictions. Some jurists have argued that even gold and silver (or other currency) can be designated as .

Documents listing endowments (waqfiyyas) often include the name of the endower, the listed property or fiscal unit, the endowed fraction (in 24-qarats), and a description of its boundary. The boundary descriptions start in Islamic direction of prayer and go counterclockwise by listing different landscape elements. Endowment deeds most often include the conditions of the endowment and its administration. 

==== Beneficiaries ====

The beneficiaries of the can be individuals and public utilities. The founder can specify which persons are eligible for benefits (such as the founder&#x27;s family, the entire community, only the poor, travelers). Public utilities such as mosques, schools, bridges, graveyards, and drinking fountains can be the beneficiaries of a . Modern legislation divides the into &quot;charitable causes,&quot; where the beneficiaries are the public or the poor, and &quot;family&quot; , where the founder designates their relatives as beneficiaries. There can also be multiple beneficiaries. For example, the founder may stipulate that half the proceeds go to their family, while the other half goes to the poor.

Valid beneficiaries must satisfy the following conditions:
* They must be identifiable. At least some of the beneficiaries must also exist at the time of the founding of the . The Mālikīs, however, hold that a may exist for some time without beneficiaries, and the proceeds accumulated are given to beneficiaries once they come into existence. An example of a non-existent beneficiary is an unborn child.
* The beneficiaries must not be at war with the Muslims. Scholars stress that non-Muslim citizens of the Islamic state () can definitely be beneficiaries.
* The beneficiaries may not use the for a purpose in contradiction of Islamic principles.

There is dispute over whether the founder themselves can reserve exclusive rights to use . Most scholars agree that once the is founded, it cannot be taken back.

The Ḥanafīs hold that the list of beneficiaries includes a perpetual element; the must specify its beneficiaries in case.

==== Declaration of founding ====

The declaration of founding is usually a written document, accompanied by a verbal declaration, though neither are required by most scholars. Whatever the declaration, most scholars (those of the Hanafi, Shafi&#x27;i, some of the Hanbali and the Imami Shi&#x27;a schools) hold that it is not binding and irrevocable until actually delivered to the beneficiaries or put to their use. Once in their use, however, the becomes an institution in its own right.

=== Administration ===
Usually, a has a range of beneficiaries. Thus, the founder makes arrangements beforehand by appointing an administrator (called or or ) and lays down the rules for appointing successive administrators. The founder may choose to administer the during their lifetime. In some cases, however, the number of beneficiaries is quite limited. Thus, there is no need for an administrator, and the beneficiaries themselves can take care of the .

The administrator, like other persons of responsibility under Islamic law, must have the capacity to act and contract. In addition, trustworthiness and administrative skills are required. Some scholars require that the administrator of this Islamic religious institution be a Muslim, though the Hanafis drop this requirement.

=== Extinction ===
A is intended to be perpetual and last forever. Nevertheless, Islamic law envisages conditions under which the may be terminated:
* If the goods of the are destroyed or damaged. Scholars interpret this as the case where goods are no longer used in the manner intended by the founder. The remains of the goods are to revert to the founder or their heirs. Other scholars, however, hold that all possibilities must be examined to see if the goods of the can be used at all, exhausting all methods of exploitation before termination. Thus, land, according to such jurists, can never become extinguished.
* A can be declared null and void by the , or religious judge, if its formation includes committing acts otherwise illegal in Islam, or it does not satisfy the conditions of validity, or if it is against the notion of philanthropy. Since is an Islamic institution, it becomes void if the founder converts to another religion.
* According to the Mālikī school of thought, the termination of the may be specified in its founding declaration. As the would expire whenever its termination conditions are fulfilled (e.g., the last beneficiary). The property then reverts to the founder or to their heirs.

==History and location==

The practices attributed to Muhammad have promoted the institution of from the earliest part of Islamic history.

The two oldest known (deed) documents are from the 9th century, while a third one dates from the early 10th century, all three within the Abbasid Period. The oldest dated goes back to 876 CE and concerns a multi-volume edition of the Qur&#x27;an currently held by the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum in Istanbul. A possibly older is a papyrus held by the Louvre Museum in Paris, with no written date but considered to be from the mid-9th century. The next oldest document is a marble tablet whose inscription bears the Islamic date equivalent to 913 CE and states the status of an inn, but is in itself not the original deed; it is held at the Eretz Israel Museum in Tel Aviv.

According to Marom,The latter stages of the Mamluk period witnessed the encumberment of considerable properties as religious endowments [...]. Waqfization aimed [...] to control sources of revenue in a time of property confiscation and socio- economic upheavals and political insecurities. According to Islamic law, only an owner (mallāk) can dedicate properties as waqf, therefore necessitating the production, confirmation and dissemination of official legal deeds which document the process [...]. Because of the permanence [of] endowments under shari‘ah law, the Ottoman judiciary collected, copied and abridged many of these endowments, whose original deeds are otherwise lost. By the early 1800s, more than half of all arable land in the Ottoman Empire was classified as a waqf. This figure included 75 percent of arable land in present-day Turkey, one-fifth in Egypt, one-seventh in Iran, one-half in Algeria, one-third in Tunisia, and one-third in Greece. 

=== Saudi Arabia ===
The total number of registered endowments in Saudi Arabia is 33,229.

===Jerusalem===

In the 16th century, the Haseki Sultan Complex charitable complex was founded by the wife of Suleyman the Magnificent and serviced 26 villages; the institution also included shops, a bazaar, two soap plants, 11 flour mills and two bathhouses located in Ottoman Syria and Lebanon. For several centuries, the income generated by these businesses contributed in the maintenance of a mosque, a soup kitchen, and two traveler and pilgrim inns.

===Egypt===
The earliest pious foundations in Egypt were charitable gifts, and not in the form of a . The first mosque built by &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As is an example of this: the land was donated by Qaysaba bin Kulthum, and the mosque&#x27;s expenses were then paid by the . The earliest known , founded by financial official Abū Bakr Muḥammad bin Ali al-Madhara&#x27;i in 919 (during the Abbasid period), is a pond called Birkat Ḥabash together with its surrounding orchards, whose revenue was to be used to operate a hydraulic complex and feed the poor.

===India===

Early references to in India can be found in the 14th-century work by Aynul Mulk ibn Mahru. According to the book, Muhammad of Ghor dedicated two villages in favor of a congregational mosque in Multan, and, handed its administration to the Shaykh al-Islām (highest ecclesiastical officer of the Empire). In the coming years, several more were created, as the Delhi Sultanate flourished.

As per the Wakf Act 1954 (later Wakf Act 1995) enacted by the government of India, are categorized as (a) by user such as graveyards, (Sarai) and &quot;Chowltries&quot; etc., (b) under (Service Inam) such as &quot;Khazi&quot; service, &quot;Nirkhi&quot; service, &quot;Pesh Imam&quot; service and &quot;Khateeb&quot; service etc., and (c) &quot;Wakf Alal-aulad&quot; is dedicated by the Donor (&quot;Wakif&quot;) for the benefit of their kith and kin and for any purpose recognised by Muslim law as pious, religious or charitable. After the enactment Wakf Act 1954, the Union government directed to all the states governments to implement the Act for administering the wakf institutions like mosques, dargahs, hussainiyas, graveyards, , , anjumans, and various religious and charitable institutions. A statutory body under Government of India, which also oversees State Wakf Boards. In turn the State Wakf Boards work towards management, regulation and protect the Wakf properties by constituting District Wakf Committees, Mandal Wakf Committees and Committees for the individual Wakf Institutions. As per the report of Sachar Committee (2006) there are about 500,000 registered Wakfs with land in India, and Rs. 60 billion book value.

=== Zanzibar ===
While it is difficult to pinpoint the historical origins of &quot;waqf&quot; in East Africa, the practice began to formalize in the 17th Century after the Sultan of Oman, Sayyid Saïd, had cemented his control over Zanzibar and the East African coastline. Until this point, archeological evidence has unearthed several old mosques along the Swahili Coast which are believed to be informal &quot;waqf&quot; dating as far back as the 8th Century. The formalization of &quot;waqf&quot; can be traced back to 1820 when Sultan Said moved the Omani Sultanate to Stone Town, Zanzibar. This marked a shift from &quot;waqf&quot; as an Islamic scriptural imperative to a local and centralized institutional practice legitimated by the royal family. From this point onward, the urban development of the port city of the East African archipelago was shaped by &quot;waqf&quot; practices. As such, the majority of greater Stone Town became &quot;waqf&quot; property made available for free habitation or cemeteries by noblemen, approximately 6.4% of which was public housing for the poor. 

It is important to note that economic changes in Zanzibar shaped &quot;waqf&quot; practices overtime. Under Omani rule slavery and the cash crop industry was booming, specifically because of the exportation of spices, which strengthened the elite class of the Omani aristocracy. In the context of growing inequality, the nobility used &quot;waqf&quot; to provide public housing to slaves and peasants as well mosques, madrasahs and land for free habitation and cultivation. For instance, all 66 mosques in Stone Town were waqf privately financed and owned by noble waqif as a display of social status and duty to their neighborhood. Under this system, the architectural configuration of Stone Town was entirely managed by the Sultanate and its network of nobility. This effectively allowed elites to practice &quot;zakat&quot; through &quot;waqf&quot; while doubling as a means to secure control over the local population. 

The East African archipelago underwent an economic recession from 1860 to 1880 that threatened the private property of the elite class. In a time when landowners were forced to sell or mortgage their properties to foreign investors, &quot;waqf&quot; became a means to legally safeguard properties under conditions of debt. In donating assets to the public, the aristocracy managed to preserve their wealth while providing land, financial support and community spaces such as mosques to the general public. 

When Zanzibar became a British protectorate in 1890, almost half the island was &quot;waqf&quot; property. In order to establish control, the British realised that they would either have to privatise &quot;waqf&quot; or gain administrative control over them. A series of decrees were subsequently issues to incorporate all &quot;waqf&quot; properties into the colonial bureaucracy. The Waqf Property Decree which formed the Waqf Commission in 1905 was composed of a majority of British officials and a minority of Islamic authorities to represent the Sultanate who maintained a degree of influence over the island. This shift marked the further formalization of &quot;waqf&quot; into the state apparatus, a move which allowed the English to directly control the preservation and maintenance of publicly used assets as well as the surplus revenues generated from them. It was also part of what Ali Mazrui calls the &#x27;dis-Islamization&#x27; and &#x27;de-Arabization&#x27; of Swahili culture by British colonialism, a strategy used to rid the territory of Omani influence. While Mazrui speaks of this in the context of the Swahili language, it can also be seen by the way in which the British deviated from the Islamic values underpinning &quot;waqf&quot; practices. What was initially intended as a charitable practice that would provide social services was replaced by a focus on profit over public welfare. This ruptured the social and political relations that were formed between the upper and lower classes during Omani rule as the underlying values used to manage waqf were lost in translation. 

The Zanzibari Revolution which followed a year after independence in 1963 installed a new government under the helm of the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). An important part of the revolution was the prosecution of the Zanzibari elite of Arabic descent. This left a significant portion of land, much of which was &quot;waqf&quot;, to be nationalised by the newly independent state as part of their socialist development programme. The revolution highlights a crucial turn point in &quot;waqf&quot; institutions in Zanzibar, namely the &#x27;public&#x27; ownership of these assets that disposed of the need for a &quot;waqif&quot;. In this way, &quot;waqf&quot; was further cemented as a political institution regulated by a centralized state while being managed by &quot;mutawallis&quot;. It allowed the poorest inhabitants of Stone Town to reside in &quot;waqf&quot; buildings that were previously reserved for the relatives of &quot;waqif&quot; families. While this may appear to be an act of good fortune, the nationalisation of all &quot;waqf&quot; assets led to the loss and destruction of many properties because of a lack of funding because the state did not have the means to preserve &quot;waqf&quot; as effectively as it were under the private control of &quot;waqif&quot; nobility. 

According to Bowen, when practicing Islam, Muslims &quot;engage in a dialogue between potentially conflicting cultural orders: the universalistic imperatives of Islam (as locally understood) and the values embedded in a particular society&quot;. While Bowen analyzes how Islamic rituals are practiced in context, this logic can arguably be applied to how the history of waqf in Zanzibar is shaped by &quot;local cultural concerns and to universalistic scriptural imperatives&quot;. In fact, this conflict is evident in the way in which &quot;waqf&quot; has historically served a dual purpose in Zanzibar; to satisfy the inalienable Islamic law of &quot;waqf&quot; as a source of charity and thereby public welfare while doubling as a tool of domination used by the ruling class to maintain the dependence of the lower classes. While the former was somewhat preserved as a scripture-based normative foundation of &quot;waqf&quot; institutions, the nature and dynamics of the latter was contingent on the nature and dynamics of regime changes in Zanzibar. Under Omani rule, &quot;waqf&quot; was practiced by the aristocratic class as an outward demonstration of Islamic piety while simultaneously serving as a means to control slaves and the local population through social housing, educational facilities and religious institutions like mosques. When an economic recession threatened the position of the elite, noblemen used &quot;waqf&quot; to maintain ownership of their properties to avoid selling or mortgaging their land thereby altering the economic function of the practice. After the British gained control of Zanzibar and further formalized &quot;waqf&quot; as a political institution, it was used to culturally subvert the local population and gradually rid it off its Arabic origins. This persisted after independence when the newly independent state sought to further eliminate Arabic influence by nationalizing all waqf properties as a means to gain control of private property.

===Other===
The &quot;waqf&quot; institutions were not popular in all parts of the Muslim world. In West Africa, very few examples of the institution can be found, and were usually limited to the area around Timbuktu and Djenné in Massina Empire. Instead, Islamic west African societies placed a much greater emphasis on non-permanent acts of charity. According to expert Illife, this can be explained by West Africa&#x27;s tradition of &quot;personal largesse.&quot; The imam would make himself the collector and distributor of charity, thus building his personal prestige.

According to Hamas, all of historic Palestine is an Islamic waqf. This belief, a relatively recent one, forms part of the group&#x27;s mythology.

In Southeastern Europe, there are several places in Bosnia and Herzegovina that were originally built under the waqf system, such as Gornji Vakuf, and Donji Vakuf.

==Funding of schools and hospitals==

After the Islamic waqf law and madrassah foundations were firmly established by the 10th century, the number of Bimaristan hospitals multiplied throughout Islamic lands. By the 11th century, many Islamic cities had several hospitals. The waqf trust institutions funded the hospitals for various expenses, including the wages of doctors, ophthalmologists, surgeons, chemists, pharmacists, domestics and all other staff, the purchase of foods and ; hospital equipment such as beds, mattresses, bowls and perfumes; and repairs to buildings. The waqf trusts also funded medical schools, and their revenues covered various expenses such as their maintenance and the payment of teachers and students.

From the more peculiar examples of healthcare-related waqfs, in the city of Tripoli, a man had set up a waqf which employed two people who would &quot;walk through the hospitals every day and speak quietly to one another in the patients&#x27; hearing, remarking on their improvement and good colour&quot;.

==Comparisons with trust law==
The &quot;waqf&quot; in Islamic law, which developed in the medieval Islamic world from the 7th to 9th centuries, bears a notable resemblance to the English trust law. Every &quot;waqf&quot; was required to have a &quot;waqif&quot; (founder), &quot;mutawillis&quot; (trustee), &quot;qadi&quot; (judge) and beneficiaries. Under both a &quot;waqf&quot; and a trust, &quot;property is reserved, and its usufruct appropriated, for the benefit of specific individuals, or for a general charitable purpose; the corpus becomes inalienable; estates for life in favor of successive beneficiaries can be created&quot; and &quot;without regard to the law of inheritance or the rights of the heirs; and continuity is secured by the successive appointment of trustees or &quot;mutawillis&quot;.&quot;

The only significant distinction between the Islamic &quot;waqf&quot; and English trust was &quot;the express or implied reversion of the &quot;waqf&quot; to charitable purposes when its specific object has ceased to exist&quot;, though this difference only applied to the &quot;waqf ahli&quot; (Islamic family trust) rather than the &quot;waqf khairi&quot; (devoted to a charitable purpose from its inception). Another difference was the English vesting of &quot;legal estate&quot; over the trust property in the trustee, though the &quot;trustee was still bound to administer that property for the benefit of the beneficiaries.&quot; In this sense, the &quot;role of the English trustee therefore does not differ significantly from that of the &quot;mutawalli&quot;.&quot;

Personal trust law developed in England at the time of the Crusades, during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Court of Chancery, under the principles of equity, enforced the rights of absentee Crusaders who had made temporary assignments of their lands to caretakers. It has been speculated that this development may have been influenced by the &quot;waqf&quot; institutions in the Middle East.

<text>The Comateens were originally a new wave duo formed in 1978 in New York City by bassist/vocalist Nicholas Dembling (a.k.a. Nic North / Nick West) and guitarist Ramona Janquitto, who performs under the name Ramona Jan. Soon after, Lyn Byrd joined on vocals and synthesizer, and the duo became a trio. When Jan departed in 1980, North&#x27;s brother Oliver joined on guitar, completing the final lineup.

They contributed two tracks to the influential &quot;Marty Thau Presents 2x5&quot; compilation, and their debut album, the self-titled &quot;Comateens&quot; (1980), featured the band&#x27;s original compositions alongside covers of &quot;Summer in the City&quot; (The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful), &quot;TVC 15&quot; (David Bowie), and the theme song from TV&#x27;s &quot;The Munsters&quot;. &quot;Pictures on a String&quot;, their first album for Virgin Records, followed in 1983, yielding the dance club hit &quot;Get Off My Case&quot;. In 1984, the band released their final album, &quot;Deal with It&quot;, which featured live drums played by Chuck Sabo.

The band split up in 1985. Oliver North died in 1987 of asthma-related heart failure due to a heroin overdose. In 1988 Nic North (now Nicholas West) and Lyn Byrd recorded an album, &quot;West &amp; Byrd&quot;, together. In 1990 the duo, again under the name Comateens, recorded the song &quot;A Place for Me&quot;, an English language adaptation of the Julien Clerc and Françoise Hardy song &quot;Fais-moi une place&quot;, and it became a European hit. Virgin Records released a retrospective compilation of their music in 1991 called &quot;One By One: Best Of Comateens&quot; which has become a rare and much sought-after record among collectors of new wave music. In 1995, their video for &quot;The Late Mistake&quot; was mocked in a season five episode of Beavis and Butt-head called &quot;Top O&#x27;The Mountain&quot;.

In November 2023, Nicholas Dembling and Ramona Jan reunited as friends and re-released original single &quot;Danger Zone&quot; backed with &quot;Elizabeth&#x27;s Lover&quot; on Left-for-Dead Records.

<text>The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG or UNC Greensboro) is a public research university in Greensboro, North Carolina. It is part of the University of North Carolina system. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, specialist, and doctoral degrees. 

The university offers over 100 undergraduate, 61 master&#x27;s, and 26 doctoral programs. UNCG is also home to the Weatherspoon Art Museum.

==History==

The university was established as a woman&#x27;s college in 1891 by legislative enactment and opened in 1892. Credit for the establishment of UNCG is given to Charles Duncan McIver. McIver served as the institution&#x27;s first Chief Executive Officer with the title of President. This position was also known as Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor since 1945.

The school provided business, domestic science, and teaching instruction, with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray donated the original site in Greensboro, where the first building was erected, with state funds totaling $30,000. 

It is North Carolina&#x27;s first and only public university founded to educate women. In 1949, it became the nation&#x27;s largest all-female institution.

The school has seen many names over the years, changing from the State Normal and Industrial School to the State Normal and Industrial College in 1896, and again in 1919 to North Carolina College for Women. In 1932, it changed to the Woman&#x27;s College of the University of North Carolina, when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina; it changed again to the University of North Carolina at Greensboro when men were first admitted to the school in 1963.

In 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; list ranked UNC Greensboro 559th out of 650 universities, liberal arts colleges, and service academies nationwide; 202nd among public universities, and 128th among schools in the South.

==Campus==
Historic structures include the Julius I. Foust Building (1891), Spencer Hall (1904, 1907), the Quad (1919–1923), the Chancellor&#x27;s Residence (1923), the former Aycock Auditorium (1927), renamed UNCG Auditorium (2016), and Alumni House (1937). Other features include a statue of Minerva, to the east of Elliott University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university&#x27;s new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.

==Athletics==
The intercollegiate athletics program at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro reaches as far back as the late 1940s. During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in Division III (non-scholarship) and then Division II (scholarship) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, and all teams have competed in Division 1 since Fall 1991. Between 1982 and 1987 the Men&#x27;s Soccer team won the NCAA Division III national championship title every year except for 1984. Today UNCG competes in the Southern Conference, which is made up of 10 schools across five states in the Southeast.

UNCG&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team moved into a &quot;new&quot; home in 2009–10, making the Greensboro Coliseum their home court.

Former UNCG women&#x27;s basketball coach Lynne Agee, who retired following the 2010–11 season, ranks among the most successful coaches in intercollegiate women&#x27;s basketball history. She is one of just 45 coaches in the history of the women&#x27;s game to have engineered more than 600 victories. Under Agee&#x27;s guidance, UNCG reached the 20-win plateau 16 times. The Spartans also earned berths into the Division I national tournament once, the Division II tournament once and the Division III tournament seven times. With Agee at the helm, UNCG became one of only 10 teams nationally (all divisions) to reach the NCAA tournament each of the first seven years it was held (1982–88). With UNCG&#x27;s 1998 NCAA appearance, Agee became the first women&#x27;s coach in history to take teams to the NCAA tournament in all three divisions.

John Z. Kiss was appointed Dean on July 1, 2016.

UNCG requires all students, no matter what their major, to complete a General Education Curriculum (GEC) that includes courses in the traditional liberal arts, as well as courses that introduce them to new perspectives that have become increasingly important today. The college offers most of the university&#x27;s general education courses, in addition to the hundreds of more specialized courses that make up its undergraduate majors and graduate programs.

==== English Department ====
The English Department, established in 1893, offers a Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, PhD, and multiple minors. The writing program was, and continues to be, one of the most popular and successful parts of department. A writing center was established in 1985 aimed at students in the College of Arts and Sciences. Today, the university Writing Center caters to all students and faculty and is housed under the Division of Student Success along with a Speaking Center, Digital ACT Studio, and Academic Achievement Center. The department is ranked #7 in 2021 in NC for the English BA. The PhD program has been recognized on U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s 2022 Best Graduate School Rankings as the #3 PhD in English program in NC and #99 overall.

The English Department is housed in the Moore Humanities and Research Administration Building, but was previously housed in the now-demolished McIver Building, which was called &quot;the ugliest classroom building in America.&quot;

===== Notable Alumni &amp; Faculty =====

All Honors students take special Honors courses that are generally restricted to no more than 20–25 students and often have an interdisciplinary focus. For those who wish to complete &quot;International Honors&quot; or &quot;Full University Honors&quot;, an international experience and a second language are required.

=== Joseph M. Bryan School of Business and Economics ===

The Bryan School of Business and Economics is the largest of UNCG&#x27;s seven professional schools. It was founded in 1969 and is named for Joseph M.

=== School of Education ===

The School of Education has several graduate programs, notably a Doctorate in Philosophy (PhD) in Educational Studies with a Concentration in Cultural Studies from the Educational Leadership and Cultural Foundations Department.

The history of UNCG&#x27;s School of Education has its roots in the founding of the university itself. Originally designated in 1891 as the North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School, UNCG was established as a school to train women educators, based on the assumption that if women received training they would, in turn, educate their children and ultimately improve the level of education and literacy in the state.

For almost a decade after the Normal was founded, the curriculum involved diplomas awarded for work that was distinctly below college level. At the time, few public high schools turned out female graduates who were prepared to handle college-level work. The Normal School became a full-fledged College in 1897. Baccalaureate degrees followed in 1903 and graduates were awarded a &quot;diploma and life license&quot; to teach in North Carolina.

=== College of Visual and Performing Arts ===
The UNCG College of Visual and Performing Arts is home to over 900 student majors and more than 100 distinguished faculty members. On July 1, 2010, the School of Music was combined administratively with the departments of theater and dance to create the School of Music, Theatre and Dance. In 2016, the Department of Art was transferred from the College of Arts and Sciences, thus giving way to the renaming of the unit. The offices for the new combined school remain in the current music building, with the Art Department remaining at its present location.

=== School of Nursing ===
The School of Nursing was established in September 1966 under the leadership of the first dean, Eloise R. Lewis. The first class of BSN students graduated in 1970. In 1976, the MSN program was initiated. The School began the PhD program in the Fall 2005. The School continues to offer both undergraduate and graduate programs with over 4,000 alumni. The School also offers an outreach program in Hickory, North Carolina for RN to BSN students and a concentration in education for MSN students.

===School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering===
The Joint School of Nanoscience &amp; Nanoengineering (&quot;JSNN&quot;) is a collaborative project
between North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University and UNCG.

The Joint School for Nanoscience and Nanoengineering is expected to offer Professional Master of Science and PhD degrees in Nanoscience and Nanoengineering. Nanoscience and Nanoengineering training for scientists and engineers already in the workforce.

Programs of study focus on three main areas: nanobioscience, which emphasizes biological and chemical aspects of nanoscience; nanotechnology, which emphasizes engineering and ecological aspects; and environmental nanoscience, which will address the ethical and environmental implications of nanoscience. These programs of study lead to Professional Master&#x27;s or Ph.D. degrees. The biological and chemical research emphasis offered by the JSNN is the first in the nation. The only other two existing professional master&#x27;s programs in nanoscience and nanoengineering are at Rice University and University at Albany, SUNY, neither of which offers a biological or chemical emphasis.

===The Graduate School===
The Graduate School at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro directs and manages the graduate programs on campus for approximately 3600 graduate students from 33 states and 34 foreign countries.

==Other notable academic units==

===MFA Writing Program===
During the early years, the university had among its faculty several noted writers, such as Allen Tate, Caroline Gordon, John Crowe Ransom, Hiram Haydn, Peter Taylor, Robie Macauley and Randall Jarrell.
