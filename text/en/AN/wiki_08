<text>Hummus (, ; , , also spelled hommus or houmous), is a Middle Eastern dip, spread, or savory dish made from cooked, mashed chickpeas blended with tahini, lemon juice, and garlic. The standard garnish in the Middle East includes olive oil, a few whole chickpeas, parsley, and paprika.

The earliest mention of hummus was in a 13th century cookbook attributed to the historian Ibn al-Adim from Aleppo in present-day Syria.

Commonly consumed in Middle Eastern cuisine, it is usually eaten as a dip with pita bread. In the West, it is produced industrially and consumed as a snack or appetizer with crackers or vegetables.

==Etymology and spelling==
The word &quot;hummus&quot; is &#x27;chickpeas&#x27;. The full name of the prepared spread in Arabic is &#x27;chickpeas with tahini&#x27;. The colloquial Arabic word is a variant of the Arabic or which may be derived from the Aramaic language ( ), corresponding to the Syriac word for chickpeas: . The word entered the English language around the mid-20th century from the Arabic or via its borrowing for the name of the dish in .

Spelling of the word in English can be inconsistent, though most major dictionaries from American and British publishers give &quot;hummus&quot; as the primary spelling. Some American dictionaries give &quot;hommos&quot; as an alternative, while British dictionaries give &quot;houmous&quot; or &quot;hoummos&quot;.

The major British supermarkets use &quot;houmous&quot;.

Other spellings include &quot;homous&quot;, &quot;houmos&quot;, &quot;houmus&quot;, and similar variants. While &quot;humus&quot; (as it is spelled in Turkish) is sometimes found, it is avoided as a heteronym of humus, organic matter in soil.

==Origin and history==
Although multiple different theories and claims of origins exist in various parts of the Middle East, evidence is insufficient to determine the precise location or time of the invention of hummus. Its basic ingredients—chickpeas, sesame, lemon, and garlic—have been combined and eaten in Egypt and the Levant for centuries. Though regional populations widely ate chickpeas, and often cooked them in stews and other hot dishes, puréed chickpeas eaten cold with tahini do not appear in records before the Abbasid Caliphate in Egypt and the Levant.

The earliest mention of Hummus comes from Syria, in a 13th-century cookbook attributed to the Aleppine historian Ibn al-Adim. Other early written recipes for a dish resembling &quot;&quot; are recorded in cookbooks written in Cairo in the 14th-century. A cold purée of chickpeas with vinegar and pickled lemons with herbs, spices, and oil, but no tahini or garlic, appears in the &quot;Treasure Trove of Benefits and Variety at the Table&quot; (); and a purée of chickpeas and tahini called appears in Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Dishes&quot;: it is based on puréed chickpeas and tahini, and acidulated with vinegar (not lemon), but it also contains many spices, herbs, and nuts, and no garlic. It is also served by rolling it out and letting it sit overnight.

==Regional preparations==
As an appetizer and dip, diners scoop hummus with flatbread, such as pita. It is also served as part of a meze or as an accompaniment to falafel, grilled chicken, fish, or eggplant.

Hummus is a common dip in Egypt where it is eaten with pita, and frequently flavored with cumin or other spices.

In the Levant, hummus has long been a staple food, often served as a warm dish, with bread for breakfast, lunch or dinner. All of the ingredients in hummus are easily found in gardens, farms and markets, thus adding to the availability and popularity of the dish. Hummus is usually garnished with olive oil, &quot;nana&quot; mint leaves, paprika, and parsley.

Hummus is a common part of everyday meals in Israel. It is made from ingredients that, following Kashrut (Jewish dietary laws), can be combined with both meat and dairy meals. Chickpea dishes have long been part of the cuisine of Jews who lived in the Middle East and Northern Africa. The many Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from these countries brought their own unique variations, such as hummus with fried eggplant and boiled eggs prepared by Iraqi Jews. Israeli versions use large amounts of tahini for a creamier texture.

One author calls hummus, &quot;One of the most popular and best-known of all Syrian dishes&quot; and a &quot;must on any mezzeh table.&quot; Syrian and Lebanese in Canada&#x27;s Arab diaspora prepare and consume hummus along with other dishes like falafel, kibbeh and tabbouleh, even among the third- and fourth-generation offspring of the original immigrants.

In Cyprus, hummus is part of the local cuisine in both Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities where it is called &quot;humoi&quot; (). In the United Kingdom, hummus was popularized by Greek Cypriot caterers, sometimes leading to a perception of it being a Greek food.

In Turkey, hummus is considered a meze.

In France, in the region of Provence, there is a dish called poichichade that resembles hummus.

In the United States and Europe, hummus is commercially available in numerous traditional and non-traditional varieties, such as beet or chocolate.

==Nutrition==
Chickpeas, the main ingredient of conventional hummus, have appreciable amounts of dietary fiber, protein, vitamin B6, manganese and other nutrients.

As hummus recipes vary, so does nutritional content, depending primarily on the relative proportions of chickpeas, tahini, and water. Hummus provides roughly 170 calories for 100 grams, and is a good to excellent (more than 10% of the Daily Value) source of dietary fiber, vitamin B6, and several dietary minerals.

==Packaged product==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 1980s, the supermarket Waitrose was the first British supermarket to stock hummus, spelled houmous. Hummus was popularized in the UK by chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi, Claudia Roden and Anissa Helou. As of 2013, £60 million worth of hummus was sold in the UK each year, and one survey found that 41% of Britons had hummus in their fridge, twice as many as the rest of Europe. A Waitrose spokesperson said it had become a grocery staple.

===United States===
In 2006, hummus was present in 12 percent of American households, rising to 17 percent by early 2009. One commentator attributed the growth of hummus to America&#x27;s embrace of ethnic and exotic foods.

While in 2006–08 when some 15 million Americans consumed hummus, and annual national sales were about $5 million, sales growth in 2016 was reflected by an estimated 25% of US households consuming hummus. By 2016, the leading American hummus manufacturer, Sabra Dipping Company, held a 62% market share for hummus sales in the United States, and was forecast to exceed $1 billion in sales in 2017.

To meet the rising consumer demand for hummus, American farmers increased their production of chickpeas four-fold since 2009, harvesting more than in 2015, an increase from in 2009. Hummus consumption has been so popular that many tobacco farmers have switched to growing chickpeas to meet demand.

==In culture==

Hummus is often seen as an unofficial &quot;national dish&quot; of Israel, reflecting its huge popularity and significance among the entire Israeli population, which Israel&#x27;s critics describe as an appropriation of Lebanese, Palestinian or Arab culture. According to Ofra Tene and Dafna Hirsch, the dispute over ownership of hummus exposes nationalism through food and the important role played by the industrialization of hummus made by Israeli private companies in 1958. Although, hummus has traditionally been part of the cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews who lived in Arabic-speaking lands, the dish was also popularized among the Jewish immigrants from Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century. Historian Dafna Hirsch describes its adoption in their diet as part of an attempt of blending in the Middle Eastern environment, while sociologist Rafi Grosglick points out the importance of its health aspects to their diet. In recent years, through a process of gourmetization, the Arab identity of hummus became a marker of its authenticity, making famous Arab-Israeli villages such as Abu Gosh and Kafr Yasif. Hence, enthusiasts travel to the more remote Arab and Druze villages in the northern Galilee region for culinary experiences.

In October 2008, the Association of Lebanese Industrialists petitioned the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade to request protected status from the European Commission for hummus as a uniquely Lebanese food, similar to the Protected Geographical Status rights held over regional food items by various European Union countries. , the Lebanese Industrialists Association was still &quot;collecting documents and proof&quot; to support its claim.

The 2005 short film &quot;West Bank Story&quot; features a rivalry between two fictional restaurants, the Israeli &quot;Kosher King&quot; and the Palestinian &quot;Hummus Hut&quot;. A parody of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, the film won the 2006 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. In 2012, Australian filmmaker Trevor Graham released a documentary, &quot;Make Hummus Not War&quot;, on the political and gastronomic aspects of hummus.

Lebanon and Israel&#x27;s chefs have been engaged in a competition over the largest dish of hummus, as validated by the Guinness World Record, as a form of contestation of &quot;ownership&quot;. The &quot;title&quot; has gone back and forth between Israel (2008), Lebanon (2009), Israel (January 2010), and, , Lebanon (May 2010). The winning dish, cooked by 300 cooks in the village of al-Fanar, near Beirut, weighed approximately , more than double the weight of the Israeli-Arab previous record.

<text>Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (died 31 BC) was a general and politician of ancient Rome in the 1st century BC.

==Life==
During Caesar&#x27;s civil war, Ahenobarbus was captured with his father, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, at Corfinium in 49 BC, and was present at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, but did not take any further part in the war. He did not however return to Italy until 46 BC, when he was pardoned by Julius Caesar. He probably played no part in Caesar&#x27;s assassination, although some writers claim that he was one of the conspirators. He followed Brutus into Macedonia after Caesar&#x27;s death, and was condemned by the &quot;Lex Pedia&quot; in 43 BC as one of the murderers.

In 42 BC he commanded a fleet of fifty ships in the Ionian Sea, and gained considerable success against the Second Triumvirate, completely defeating Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus on the day of the first battle of Philippi, as the latter attempted to sail out of Brundisium. He was saluted imperator in consequence, and a record of this victory is preserved in the annexed coin, which represents a trophy placed upon the prow of a vessel. The head on the other side of the coin has a beard, in reference to the reputed origin of the Ahenobarbus family.

After the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, Ahenobarbus conducted the war independently of Sextus Pompey, and with a fleet of seventy ships and two legions plundered the coasts of the Ionian Sea.

In 40 BC, through the mediation of Gaius Asinius Pollio, Ahenobarbus became reconciled to Mark Antony, which greatly offended Octavian. In the peace concluded with Sextus Pompeius in 39 BC, Antony provided for the safety of Ahenobarbus, and obtained for him the promise of the consulship for 32 BC. Ahenobarbus accompanied Antony on his ill-fated invasion of Parthia in 36 BC; after one particularly devastating defeat, Antony was too despondent to boost the morale of his troops, so he gave that duty to Ahenobarbus. Antony placed him in command of Bithynia, which he governed until 35 BC or perhaps after. In 35 BC he supported Gaius Furnius, governor of Asia against Pompeius.

He became consul, according to agreement, in 32 BC, in which year the open rupture took place between Anthony and Octavian. With Gaius Sosius, Ahenobarbus fled from Rome to Antony at Ephesus, where he found Cleopatra with him, and endeavoured, in vain, to obtain her removal from the army. Many of the soldiers, disgusted with the conduct of Antony, offered the command to Ahenobarbus, but he preferred to desert the party altogether, and defected to Octavian shortly before the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. Even though he was suffering from a fever, he took a small boat to Octavian&#x27;s side. Even though Antony was greatly upset, he still sent him all his gear, his friends and his attendants. He was not, however, present at the battle itself, as he died a few days after joining Octavian. Plutarch suggests that his death was due to &quot;the shame of his disloyalty and treachery being exposed.&quot; Suetonius says that he was the best of his family.

==Family==
Ahenobarbus&#x27;s father, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, had been consul in 54 BC. His mother was Porcia, sister of Cato the Younger and half-sister of the two Servilias: Servilia (Caesar&#x27;s mistress) and Servilia Minor (second wife of Lucullus).

His wife was Aemilia Lepida and their son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus was married to Antonia Major, daughter of Mark Antony by Octavia the Younger. They became parents to a younger Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus, and grandparents of the Roman Emperor Nero. Ahenobarbus may also have been married to a daughter of Lucius Manlius Torquatus.

== Cultural depictions ==
The character of Domitius Enobarbus in the play &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; is loosely based on this man. He is Antony&#x27;s friend who deserts Antony for Caesar (Act III, sc. 13), is stricken with remorse (Act IV, sc. 6), and dies (Act IV, sc. 9).

<text>Antonia the Elder (born August/September 39 BC) was a niece of the first Roman emperor, Augustus, being the eldest daughter of Octavia the Younger and her second husband, the Triumvir Mark Antony. She married Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus and became the paternal grandmother of the emperor Nero.

==Biography==
Antonia was born in Athens, Greece, and after 36 BC she, her siblings, and her mother were brought to Rome. She was raised by her mother, her uncle, and her aunt Livia Drusilla. According to Cassius Dio, after her father died Augustus allowed her and her younger sister, Antonia Minor, to benefit from their father&#x27;s estate in Rome. Although little is known of her, Antonia was held in high regard like her sister Antonia Minor, the mother of the emperor Claudius, who was celebrated for her beauty and virtue.

==Issue==
Around 23 BC Antonia married the consul Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Three of their children are known for certain:

* Domitia the Elder - ancient sources refer to her as Domitia. She married the consul Decimus Haterius Agrippa and had a son with him Quintus Haterius Antoninus. Domitia later married Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus, consul suffect in 27, proconsul of Asia and consul in AD 44.
* Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (&quot;PIR2&quot; D127) - consul in AD 32, he married his cousin Germanicus&#x27; daughter Agrippina the Younger in 28. Agrippina and Domitius were the parents of the emperor Nero. He was accused by Tiberius, but saved by that emperor&#x27;s death (Suet. &quot;Nero&quot; 5) and lived a few years longer under Caligula&#x27;s reign until he died in AD 40. 
* Domitia Lepida (&quot;PIR2&quot; D180) - she first married her cousin, the consul Marcus Valerius Messalla Barbatus with whom she had a daughter, the empress Valeria Messalina, third wife of the emperor Claudius. After the death of her first husband, she married Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus, suffect consul in AD 31, and had a son with him, Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix (who would become consul in AD 52). At the beginning of Claudius&#x27; reign, she married Appius Junius Silanus, consul in AD 28, who was put to death in AD 42. She outlived her daughter, Messalina.

It is also likely that they had another son named Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (born between 20 and 17 BC), and possibly also a third daughter (born around 23 BC). Syme thinks its possible that the daughter may have lived to marry and produce children, but probably died before the reign of Caligula.

==Cultural depictions==
Many scholars think the Ara Pacis (an altar from the Augustan Era), displays Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and his elder sister. The woman behind Domitia and Domitius is allegedly their mother Antonia Major and the man next to Antonia Major is allegedly her husband Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, so identified in 1903 by Alfred von Domaszewski. However, the only son of Antonia and Ahenobarbus was born in 1 BC, which is after the Ara Pacis was completed and inaugurated. This means the boy on the frieze cannot be the infamous Gnaeus (father of Nero). Sir Ronald Syme has argued the two children are actually a lost elder son Lucius and another unknown sister. In reality, the entire family seems to be another family, probably the family of one of Augustus&#x27;s other three nieces. We know a lot about the children born and the children that did not survive in the imperial family. Gnaeus was born in 1 BC and had two older sisters. No surviving source mentions older siblings who died in childhood, whereas there are other branches of the imperial family that had exactly one son and one daughter between 21 and 15 BC.

<text>William Bliss Carman (April 15, 1861 – June 8, 1929) was a Canadian poet who lived most of his life in the United States, where he achieved international fame. He was acclaimed as Canada&#x27;s poet laureate during his later years.

In Canada, Carman is classed as one of the Confederation Poets, a group which also included Charles G.D. Roberts (his cousin), Archibald Lampman, and Duncan Campbell Scott. &quot;Of the group, Carman had the surest lyric touch and achieved the widest international recognition. But unlike others, he never attempted to secure his income by novel writing, popular journalism, or non-literary employment. He remained a poet, supplementing his art with critical commentaries on literary ideas, philosophy, and aesthetics.&quot;

==Life==
William Bliss Carman was born on April 15, 1861, in Fredericton, New Brunswick. &quot;Bliss&quot; was his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He was the great grandson of United Empire Loyalists who fled to Nova Scotia after the American Revolution, settling in New Brunswick (then part of Nova Scotia). His literary roots run deep with an ancestry that includes a mother who was a descendant of Daniel Bliss of Concord, Massachusetts, the great-uncle of Ralph Waldo Emerson. His sister, Jean, married the botanist and historian William Francis Ganong. And on his mother&#x27;s side he was a first cousin to the siblings Charles (later Sir Charles) G. D. Roberts and Elizabeth Roberts MacDonald.

===Education and early career===
Carman was first educated through a private tutor until 1872 due to medical issues stemmed from a severe nose injury he received at the age of four. Afterwards, he attended the Fredericton Collegiate School where he came under the influence of headmaster George Robert Parkin, who gave him a love of classical literature and introduced him to the poetry of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. He was later educated at the University of New Brunswick (UNB), from which he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1881. His first published poem was in the &quot;UNB Monthly&quot; in 1879. He then spent a year at Oxford and the University of Edinburgh (1882–1883), but returned home to receive his master&#x27;s degree from UNB in 1884.

After the death of his father in January 1885 and his mother in February 1886, Carman enrolled in Harvard University (1886–1887). At Harvard he moved in a literary circle that included American poet Richard Hovey, who would become his close friend and his collaborator on the successful &quot;Vagabondia&quot; poetry series. Carman and Hovey were members of the &quot;Visionists&quot; circle along with Herbert Copeland and F. Holland Day, who would later form the Boston publishing firm Copeland &amp; Day that would launch &quot;Vagabondia&quot;.

After Harvard Carman briefly returned to Canada, but was back in Boston by February 1890. &quot;Boston is one of the few places where my critical education and tastes could be of any use to me in earning money,&quot; he wrote. &quot;New York and London are about the only other places.&quot; Unable to find employment in Boston, he moved to New York City and became literary editor of the &quot;New York Independent&quot; at the grand sum of $20 a week. There he could help his Canadian friends get published, in the process &quot;introducing Canadian poets to its readers.&quot; However, Carman was never a good fit at the semi-religious weekly, and he was summarily dismissed in 1892. &quot;Brief stints would follow with &quot;Current Literature&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;The Chap-Book&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, but after 1895 he would be strictly a contributor to the magazines and newspapers, never an editor in any department.&quot;

To make matters worse, Carman&#x27;s first book of poetry, 1893&#x27;s &quot;Low Tide on Grand Pré&quot;, was not a success; no Canadian company would publish it, and the U.S. edition stiffed when its publisher went bankrupt.

===Literary success===
At this low point, &quot;Songs of Vagabondia,&quot; the first Hovey-Carman collaboration, was published by Copeland &amp; Day in 1894. It was an immediate success. &quot;No one could have been more surprised at the tremendous popularity of these care-free celebrations (the first of the three collections went through seven rapid editions) than the young authors, Richard Hovey and Bliss Carman.&quot; &quot;Songs of Vagabondia&quot; would ultimately &quot;go through sixteen printings (ranging from 500 to 1000 copies) over the next thirty years. The three &quot;Vagabondia&quot; volumes that followed fell slightly short of that record, but each went through numerous printings. Carman and Hovey quickly found themselves with a cult following, especially among college students, who responded to the poetry&#x27;s anti-materialistic themes, its celebration of individual freedom, and its glorification of comradeship.&quot;

The success of &quot;Songs of Vagabondia&quot; prompted another Boston firm, Stone &amp; Kimball, to reissue &quot;Low Tide...&quot; and to hire Carman as the editor of its literary journal, &quot;The Chapbook&quot;. The next year, though, the editor&#x27;s job went West (with Stone &amp; Kimball) to Chicago, while Carman opted to remain in Boston.

&quot;In Boston in 1895, he worked on a new poetry book, &quot;Behind the Arras&quot;, which he placed with a prominent Boston publisher (Lamson, Wolffe)... He published two more books of verse with Lamson, Wolffe.&quot; He also began writing a weekly column for the Boston &quot;Evening Transcript&quot;, which ran from 1895 to 1900.

In 1896 Carman met Mary Perry King, who became the greatest and longest-lasting female influence in his life. Mrs. King became his patron: &quot;She put pence in his purse, and food in his mouth, when he struck bottom and, what is more, she often put a song on his lips when he despaired, and helped him sell it.&quot; According to Carman&#x27;s roommate, Mitchell Kennerley, &quot;On rare occasions they had intimate relations at 10 E. 16 which they always advised me of by leaving a bunch of violets — Mary Perry&#x27;s favorite flower — on the pillow of my bed.&quot; If he knew of the latter, Dr. King did not object: &quot;He even supported her involvement in the career of Bliss Carman to the extent that the situation developed into something close to a &quot;ménage à trois&quot;&quot; with the Kings.

Through Mrs. King&#x27;s influence Carman became an advocate of &#x27;unitrinianism,&#x27; a philosophy which &quot;drew on the theories of François-Alexandre-Nicolas-Chéri Delsarte to develop a strategy of mind-body-spirit harmonization aimed at undoing the physical, psychological, and spiritual damage caused by urban modernity.&quot; This shared belief created a bond between Mrs. King and Carman but estranged him somewhat from his former friends.

In 1899 Lamson, Wolffe was taken over by the Boston firm of Small, Maynard &amp; Co., who had also acquired the rights to &quot;Low Tide...&quot; &quot;The rights to all Carman&#x27;s books were now held by one publisher and, in lieu of earnings, Carman took a financial stake in the company. When Small, Maynard failed in 1903, Carman lost all his assets.&quot;

Down but not out, Carman signed with another Boston company, L.C. Page, and began to churn out new work. Page published seven books of new Carman poetry between 1902 and 1905. As well, the firm released three books based on Carman&#x27;s &quot;Transcript&quot; columns, and a prose work on unitrinianism, &quot;The Making of Personality&quot;, that he&#x27;d written with Mrs. King. &quot;Page also helped Carman rescue his &#x27;dream project,&#x27; a deluxe edition of his collected poetry to 1903... Page acquired distribution rights with the stipulation that the book be sold privately, by subscription. The project failed; Carman was deeply disappointed and became disenchanted with Page, whose grip on Carman&#x27;s copyrights would prevent the publication of another collected edition during Carman&#x27;s lifetime.&quot;

Carman also picked up some needed cash in 1904 as editor-in-chief of the 10-volume project, &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Poetry&quot;.

===Later years===

After 1908 Carman lived near the Kings&#x27; New Canaan, Connecticut, estate, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, or in the summer in a cabin near their summer home in the Catskills, &quot;Moonshine.&quot; Between 1908 and 1920, literary taste began to shift, and his fortunes and health declined.

By 1920, Carman was impoverished and recovering from a near-fatal attack of tuberculosis. That year he revisited Canada and &quot;began the first of a series of successful and relatively lucrative reading tours, discovering &#x27;there is nothing worth talking of in book sales compared with reading.&#x27;&quot; &quot;&#x27;Breathless attention, crowded halls, and a strange, profound enthusiasm such as I never guessed could be,&#x27; he reported to a friend. &#x27;And good thrifty money too. Think of it! An entirely new life for me, and I am the most surprised person in Canada.&#x27;&quot; Carman was feted at &quot;a dinner held by the newly formed Canadian Authors&#x27; Association at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Montreal on 28 October 1921 where he was crowned Canada&#x27;s Poet Laureate with a wreath of maple leaves.&quot;

The tours of Canada continued, and by 1925 Carman had finally acquired a Canadian publisher. &quot;McClelland &amp; Stewart (Toronto) issued a collection of selected earlier verses and became his main publisher. They benefited from Carman&#x27;s popularity and his revered position in Canadian literature, but no one could convince L.C. Page to relinquish its copyrights. An edition of collected poetry was published only after Carman&#x27;s death, due greatly to the persistence of his literary executor, Lorne Pierce.&quot;

During the 1920s, Carman was a member of the Halifax literary and social set, The Song Fishermen. In 1927 he edited &quot;The Oxford Book of American Verse&quot;.

Carman died of a brain hemorrhage at the age of 68 in New Canaan, and was cremated in New Canaan. &quot;It took two months, and the influence of New Brunswick&#x27;s Premier J.B.M. Baxter and Canadian Prime Minister W.L.M. King, for Carman&#x27;s ashes to be returned to Fredericton.&quot; &quot;His ashes were buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Fredericton, and a national memorial service was held at the Anglican cathedral there.&quot; Twenty-five years later, on May 13, 1954, a scarlet maple tree was planted at his gravesite, to grant his request in his 1892 poem &quot;The Grave-Tree&quot;:
==Writing==

===&quot;Low Tide on Grand Pré&quot;===
As a student at Harvard, Carman &quot;was heavily influenced by Royce, whose spiritualistic idealism, combined with the transcendentalism of Ralph Waldo Emerson, lies centrally in the background of his first major poem, &quot;Low Tide on Grand Pré&quot; written in the summer and winter of 1886.&quot; &quot;Low Tide...&quot; was published in the Spring, 1887 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, giving Carman a literary reputation while still at Harvard. It was also included in the 1889 anthology &quot;Songs of the Great Dominion.&quot;

Literary critic Desmond Pacey considered &quot;Low Tide...&quot; to be &quot;the most nearly perfect single poem to come out of Canada. It will withstand any amount of critical scrutiny.&quot;

&quot;Low Tide...&quot; served as the title poem for Carman&#x27;s first book. &quot;The poems in this volume have been collected with reference to their similarity of tone,&quot; Carman wrote in his preface; a nostalgic tone of pervading loss and melancholy. Three outstanding examples are &quot;The Eavesdropper,&quot; &quot;In Apple Time&quot; and &quot;Wayfaring.&quot; However, &quot;none can equal the artistry of the title poem. What is more, although Carman would publish over thirty other volumes during his lifetime, none of them contains anything that surpasses this poem he wrote when he was barely twenty-five years old.&quot;

===&quot;Vagabondia&quot;===
Carman rose to prominence in the 1890s, a decade the poetry of which anthologist Louis Untermeyer has called marked by &quot;a cheerless evasion, a humorous unconcern; its most representative craftsmen were, with four exceptions, the writers of light verse.&quot; The first two of those four exceptions were Richard Hovey and Bliss Carman. For Untermeyer: &quot;The poetry of this period ... is dead because it detached itself from the world... But ... revolt openly declared itself with the publication of &quot;Songs from Vagabondia&quot; (1894), &quot;More Songs from Vagabondia&quot; (1896), and &quot;Last Songs from Vagabondia&quot; (1900)... It was the heartiness, the gypsy jollity, the rush of high spirits, that conquered. Readers of the &quot;Vagabondia&quot; books were swept along by their speed faster than by their philosophy.&quot;

Even modernists loved &quot;Vagabondia&quot;. In the &quot;October, 1912 issue of the &quot;London Poetry Review,&quot; Ezra Pound noted that he had &#x27;greatly enjoyed &quot;The Songs of Vagabondia&quot; by Mr. Bliss Carman and the late Richard Hovey.&#x27;&quot;

Carman&#x27;s most famous poem from the first volume is arguably &quot;The Joys of the Open Road.&quot; &quot;More Songs...&quot; contains &quot;A Vagabond Song,&quot; once familiar to a generation of Canadians. &quot;Canadian youngsters who were in grade seven anytime between the mid-1930s and the 1950s were probably exposed to ... &#x27;A Vagabond Song&#x27; [which] appeared in &quot;The Canada Book of Prose and Verse, Book One&quot;, the school reader that was used in nearly every province&quot; (and was edited by Lorne Pierce).

In 1912 Carman would publish &quot;Echoes from Vagabondia&quot; as a solo work. (Hovey had died in 1900). More of a remembrance book than part of the set, it has a distinct elegiac tone. It contains the lyric &quot;The Flute of Spring&quot;.

===&quot;Behind the Arras&quot;===
With &quot;Behind the Arras&quot; (1895), Carman continued his practice of &quot;bringing together poems that were &#x27;in the same key.&#x27; Whereas &quot;Low Tide on Grand Pré&quot; is elegiacal and melancholy, &quot;Songs from Vagabondia&quot; is mostly light and jaunty, while &quot;Behind the Arras&quot; is philosophical and heavy.&quot;

&quot;Behind the Arras&quot; the poem is a long meditation that uses the speaker&#x27;s house and its many rooms as a symbol of life and its choices. The poem does not succeed: &quot;there are so many asides that the allegory is lost along with any point the poet hoped to make.&quot;

===&quot;Ballad of Lost Haven&quot;===
In keeping with the &quot;same key&quot; idea, Carman&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of Lost Haven&quot; (1897) was a collection of poetry about the sea. Its notable poems include the macabre sea shanty &quot;The Gravedigger&quot;.

===&quot;By the Aurelian Wall&quot;===
&quot;By the Aurelian Wall&quot; is Carman&#x27;s elegy to John Keats. It served as the title poem of his 1898 collection, a book of formal elegies.

In the last poem in the book, &quot;The Grave-Tree,&quot; Carman writes about his own death.

===&quot;The Pipes of Pan&quot;===
&quot;Pan, the goat-god, traditionally associated with poetry and with the fusion of the earthly and the divine, becomes Carman&#x27;s organizing symbol in the five volumes issued between 1902 and 1905&quot; under the above title. Under the influence of Mrs. King, Carman had begun to write in both prose and poetry about the ideas of &#x27;unitrinianism,&#x27; &quot;a strategy of mind-body-spirit harmonization aimed at undoing the physical, psychological, and spiritual damage caused by urban modernity ... therapeutic ideas [which] resulted in the five volumes of verse assembled in &quot;Pipes of Pan&quot;.&quot; The &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography (DCB)&quot; calls the series &quot;a collection that contains many superb lyrics but, overall, evinces the dangers of a soporific aesthetic.&quot;

The &#x27;superb lyrics&#x27; include the much-anthologized &quot;The Dead Faun&quot; from Volume I, &quot;From the Book of Myths&quot;; &quot;From the Green Book of the Bards&quot;, the title poem of Volume II; &quot;Lord of My Heart&#x27;s Elation&quot; from the same volume; and many of the erotic poems of Volume III, &quot;Songs of the Sea Children&quot; (such as LIX &quot;I loved you when the tide of prayer&quot;). As a whole, though, the Pan series shows (perhaps more than any other work) the truth of Northrop Frye&#x27;s 1954 observation that Carman &quot;badly needs a skillful and sympathetic selection.&quot;

===&quot;Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics&quot;===
There were no such problems with Carman&#x27;s next book. Perhaps because of the underlying concept, &quot;Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics&quot; (1904) has a structure and unity that helps make it what has been called Carman&#x27;s &quot;finest volume of poetry&quot;.

Sappho was an Ancient Greek poet from the island of Lesbos, who was included in the Greek canon of nine lyric poets. Most of her poetry, which was well-known and greatly admired throughout antiquity, has been lost, but her reputation has endured, supported by the surviving fragments of some of her poems.

Carman&#x27;s method, as Charles G.D. Roberts saw it in his Introduction to the book, &quot;apparently, has been to imagine each lost lyric as discovered, and then to translate it; for the indefinable flavor of the translation is maintained throughout, though accompanied by the fluidity and freedom of purely original work&quot;. It was a daunting task, as Roberts admits: &quot;It is as if a sculptor of to-day were to set himself, with reverence, and trained craftsmanship, and studious familiarity with the spirit, technique, and atmosphere of his subject, to restore some statues of Polyclitus or Praxiteles of which he had but a broken arm, a foot, a knee, a finger upon which to build.&quot; Yet, on the whole, Carman succeeded.

&quot;Written more or less contemporaneously with the love poems in &quot;Songs of the Sea Children&quot;, the Sappho reconstructions continue the amorous theme from a feminine point of view. Nevertheless, the feelings ascribed to Sappho are pure Carman in their sensitive and elegiac melancholy.&quot;

Virtually all of the lyrics are of high quality; some often-quoted are XXIII (&quot;I loved thee, Atthis, in the long ago,&quot;), LIV (&quot;How soon will all my lovely days be over&quot;), LXXIV (&quot;If death be good&quot;), LXXXII (&quot;Over the roofs the honey-coloured moon&quot;).

&quot;Next to &quot;Low Tide on Grand Pré&quot;, &quot;Sappho: One Hundred Lyrics&quot; seems to be the collection that continues to find the most favour among Carman&#x27;s critics. D.M.R. Bentley, for example, calls it &#x27;undoubtedly one of the most attractive, engaging and satisfying works of any of the Confederation poets.&#x27;&quot; Bentley argued that &quot;the brief, crisp lyrics of the &quot;Sappho&quot; volume almost certainly contributed to the aesthetic and practice of Imagism.

===Later work===
In his review of 1954&#x27;s &quot;Selected Poems of Bliss Carman&quot;, literary critic Northrop Frye compared Carman and the other Confederation Poets to the Group of Seven: &quot;Like the later painters, these poets were lyrical in tone and romantic in attitude; like the painters, they sought for the most part uninhabited landscape.&quot; But Frye added: &quot;The lyrical response to landscape is by itself, however, a kind of emotional photography, and like other forms of photography is occasional and epigrammatic... Hence the lyric poet, after he has run his gamut of impressions, must die young, develop a more intellectualized attitude, or start repeating himself. Carman&#x27;s meeting of this challenge was only partly successful.&quot;

It is true that Carman had begun to repeat himself after &quot;Sappho.&quot; &quot;Much of Carman&#x27;s writing in poetry and prose during the decade preceding World War I is as repetitive as the title of &quot;Echoes from Vagabondia&quot; (1912) intimates&quot; says the &quot;DCB&quot;. What had made his poetry so remarkable at the beginning – that every new book was completely new – was gone.

However, Carman&#x27;s career was by no means over. He &quot;published four other collections of new poetry during his lifetime and two more were ready for publication at the time of his death: &quot;The Rough Rider, and Other Poems&quot; (1908), &quot;A Painter&#x27;s Holiday, and Other Poems&quot; (1911), &quot;April Airs&quot; (1916), &quot;Far Horizons&quot; (1925), &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1929), and &quot;Wild Garden&quot; (1929). James Cappon&#x27;s comment on &quot;Far Horizons&quot; applies almost equally to the other five volumes: &#x27;There is nothing new in its poetic quality which has the sweet sadness of age rehearsing old tunes with an art which is now very smooth though with less vivacity than it used to have.&#x27;&quot;

Not only did Carman continue to write, but he continued to write fine poems: poems such as &quot;The Old Grey Wall&quot; (&quot;April Airs&quot;), the Wilfred Campbell-ish &quot;Rivers of Canada&quot; (&quot;Far Horizons&quot;), &quot;The Ghost-yard of the Goldenrod&quot; and &quot;The Ships of Saint John&quot; (&quot;Later Poems&quot;, 1926), and &quot;The Winter Scene&quot; (&quot;Sanctuary: The &quot;Sunshine House&quot; sonnets&quot;). The best of these have the same nostalgic air of melancholy and loss with which Carman began in &quot;Low Tide...,&quot; but now even more poignant as the poet approached his own death.

==Recognition==
In 1906 Carman received honorary degrees from UNB and McGill University. He was elected a corresponding Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1925. The Society awarded him its Lorne Pierce Gold Medal in 1928. He was awarded a medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1929.

In 1945, Carman was recognized as a Person of National Historic Significance by the government of Canada.

Carman is honored by a sculpture erected on the UNB campus in 1947, which portrays him with fellow poets Sir Charles G.D. Roberts and Francis Joseph Sherman.

Bliss Carman Middle School in Fredericton, New Brunswick and Bliss Carman Senior Public School in Toronto, Ontario were named after him.

&quot;Bliss Carman Heights&quot; (an extension of the Skyline Acres subdivision) is a subdivision located in Fredericton, New Brunswick overlooking the Saint John River. It consists of Essex Street, Gloucester Crescent, Reading Street, Ascot Court, and Ascot Drive. An extension of the Bliss Carman Heights subdivision is named &quot;Poet&#x27;s Hill&quot; and consists of Bliss Carman Drive, Poets Lane and Windflower Court (named for one of Carman&#x27;s poems of the same name).

In October 1916, American composer Leo Sowerby was inspired to write his best-known organ piece, &quot;Comes Autumn Time,&quot; after reading Carman&#x27;s poem, &quot;Autumn,&quot; in the Literature section of the Sunday Edition of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; on October 16 of that year. &quot;Autumn&quot; was reprinted from &quot;The Atlantic&quot; on page 6 of the Chicago Daily Tribune on October 5, 1916.

Theodora Thayer&#x27;s “fine portrait of Bliss Carman is considered one of the memorable achievements in American miniature painting.”

<text>Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus (12 February AD 41 – 11 February AD 55), usually called Britannicus, was the son of Roman Emperor Claudius and his third wife, Valeria Messalina. For a time, he was considered his father&#x27;s heir, but that changed after his mother&#x27;s downfall in 48, when it was revealed she had engaged in a bigamous marriage without Claudius&#x27; knowledge. The next year, his father married Agrippina the Younger, Claudius&#x27; fourth and final marriage. Their marriage was followed by the adoption of Agrippina&#x27;s son, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, whose name became Nero as a result. His stepbrother would later be married to Britannicus&#x27; sister Octavia and soon eclipsed him as Claudius&#x27; heir. After his father&#x27;s death in October 54, Nero became emperor. The sudden death of Britannicus shortly before his fourteenth birthday is reported by all extant sources as being the result of poisoning on Nero&#x27;s orders; as Claudius&#x27; biological son, he represented a threat to Nero&#x27;s claim to the throne.

==Name==
Britannicus&#x27; name at birth was Tiberius Claudius Germanicus. The &quot;agnomen&quot;, his first surname Germanicus, was first awarded to his paternal grandfather, Drusus the Elder, after his death in 9 BC to commemorate his victories over the Germanic tribes. Accordingly, Drusus&#x27; sons (Claudius and Germanicus) inherited the name and passed it to their sons as well. Britannicus was given to his father in AD 43 after his conquest of Britain. Claudius never used it himself and gave the name to his son instead, and his full name became Tiberius Claudius Caesar Britannicus. He came to be known by his new name, which seems to have replaced &quot;Germanicus&quot; altogether.

==Background and family==

Britannicus was born on or about 12 February 41 in Rome, to Emperor Claudius and his third wife, Valeria Messalina. As such, he was a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, specifically of the &quot;gens Claudia&quot;. Britannicus&#x27; father had been reigning for less than a month, and his position was boosted greatly by the birth of an heir. To mark the birth, the emperor issued sestertii with the obverse &quot;Spes Augusta&quot;, the hope of the imperial family.

Britannicus had four siblings: a half-brother, Claudius Drusus, by Claudius&#x27; first wife (Plautia Urgulanilla), though he died before Britannicus was born; a half-sister, Antonia, by Claudius&#x27; second wife (Aelia Paetina); a sister by the same mother named Octavia; and an adoptive brother, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Emperor Nero), who was adopted in AD 49 and renamed Nero Claudius Caesar as a result.

Two years later, in 43, Claudius was granted the honorific &quot;Britannicus&quot; by the Senate as a reward for his conquest of Britain. The emperor never used the name himself but allowed his son to inherit it and is the name by which the boy became known to posterity. Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, a Roman historian, wrote from the late first century that Claudius adored Britannicus; carried him around at public events; and &quot;would wish him happy auspices, joined by the applauding throng&quot;.

==Father&#x27;s marriage to Messalina==
===Education===
Britannicus was tutored by Sosibius, who was a close associate of Publius Suillius Rufus and a friend of his mother. He was educated alongside Titus Vespasianus, the future emperor. They were brought up together and taught similar subjects by the same tutors.

In 47, Sosibius gave Claudius a reminder of the power and wealth, which threatened the emperor&#x27;s throne. His tutor then, as part of his mother&#x27;s contrivances, told the emperor of Decimus Valerius Asiaticus&#x27;s involvement in the murder of Caligula and of his growing popularity in Rome. Sosibius went on, saying Asiaticus meant to rally Roman legions in Germania against the throne. Asiaticus was apprehended immediately and brought to Rome in chains. Sullius successfully pursued charges against other equestrians in the Senate. According to Cassius Dio, Asiaticus was put to death as a favour to Messalina for his property (the Gardens of Lucullus).

It was later voted by the Senate for Sosibius to be given a million sesterces for giving Britannicus the benefit of his teachings and Claudius that of his counsel (his involvement in the case against Asiaticus).

===Fall of Messalina===

Britannicus took part in the celebrations of Rome&#x27;s 800th anniversary in AD 48. It was the sixth-ever &quot;Ludi Saeculares&quot; (&quot;Secular Games&quot;) and sixty-four years since the last one had been held in the summer of 17 BC by Augustus. Britannicus&#x27; father was there, as was Lucius Domitius and his mother Agrippina, the last two surviving descendants of Germanicus. Claudius watched the young nobility, including Britannicus and Domitius, enact the Battle of Troy in the circus. Tacitus says that Domitius was greeted with more enthusiasm than Britannicus.

The games were seen as the introduction of Agrippina and Domitius to public life, and Britannicus&#x27; mother, Messalina, must have been aware of that and been envious of Agrippina. Tacitus writes that Messalina was too busy engaging in an &quot;insane&quot; affair to plot the destruction of Agrippina. He says:

The affair continued into the next year. It was then that the affair between Messalina and Silius took a new turn. Silius, who had no children of his own, proposed to marry Messalina if she allowed him to adopt Britannicus. The plan was to overthrow Claudius and rule together as regents of Britannicus. She acquiesced and waited for Claudius to leave Rome before she performed the sacrifice and entered the bigamous marriage. The illegal union was made known to Claudius by Callistus and Narcissus, freedmen in his service. Claudius had Messalina, Silius and others who knew of the affair put to death. Messalina was given a knife to kill herself, but a tribune of the Praetorian Guard had to force it through her neck. Images and statues of Silius and his associates were ordered to be destroyed.

==Father&#x27;s marriage to Agrippina==
The fall of Silius and Messalina opened the way for Agrippina the Younger to become his father&#x27;s fourth wife. His father claimed to be uninterested in another marriage, but it was not long until he remarried. Unlike his uncle Germanicus, his father had never been adopted into the &quot;Julii&quot;. Claudius thought that marrying his niece would bring his family closer to that of Augustus, as Agrippina and Domitius were the last living descendants of Germanicus. Therefore, in 49, although a marriage between uncle and niece was incestuous under Roman law, his father remarried. As a daughter of Germanicus and a descendant of Augustus, she was very popular among soldiers and the people. In short, her excellent bloodline and strong political connections made her an attractive candidate for marriage.

===Rise of Nero===

In 49, during the term of consul-elect Mammius Pollio (March–June), Domitius was betrothed to his sister Octavia and thus became his equal in rank. Tacitus suggests that move had the support of those who feared the vengeance of Britannicus against those who wronged his mother.

By the insistence of Pallas, his father was convinced to adopt Domitius as his son. Claudius was convinced to do as Augustus had done in adopting Gaius and Lucius Caesar and as Tiberius had done in adopting Germanicus although he already had a son. In February 50, his father passed a law adopting Domitius into the &quot;Claudii&quot; and naming him Nero, and Domitius became &quot;Nero Claudius Caesar&quot;. Nero and Britannicus then became joint heirs to the emperor, and Agrippina was then given the title of &quot;Augusta&quot;.

In AD 51, his brother Nero assumed the &quot;toga virilis&quot; although he was not yet 14. The Senate also decided then that Nero should hold the consulship during his twentieth year (AD 56) and that as consul-elect, that he should enjoy &quot;imperium proconsulare&quot; (&quot;proconsular authority&quot;) beyond the limits of Rome with the title of &quot;princeps iuventutis&quot; (&quot;prince of the youth of Rome&quot;). The progress of Nero seems to have followed in the footsteps of Gaius and Lucius Caesar. To mark the occasion, a donative was given to the soldiery of Rome, and presents to the people. His stepbrother&#x27;s status, along with that of Agrippina, is echoed on contemporary coinage.

In contrast, Britannicus was progressively isolated. At the games of the circus, Nero appeared in triumphal robes while Britannicus was still dressed as a boy. Tacitus says their clothing at the games affected the expectations of the people: with Nero in a general&#x27;s clothing and Britannicus in the dress of boyhood. He was not due for the toga until 12 February AD 55. He and his supporters were seen as a potential problem for Nero. Agrippina replaced his tutors with her own nominees and had convinced Claudius to order their executions, including the execution of Sosibius. Not only his tutors but also the two prefects of the Praetorian Guard, Lusius Geta and Rufius Crispinus, were replaced. Tacitus reports that they were thought to be sympathetic to the cause of Britannicus and of his mother. His stepmother had them replaced with Sextus Afranius Burrus, who was a good soldier but knew to whom he owed his allegiance.

Nero&#x27;s career progressed steadily, and he gave speeches in AD 51 and 52. The speech in 51 thanked the emperor for honours given to him, and that of 52 was a vow for the safe recovery of the emperor from illness. It was in 53 that Nero married Britannicus&#x27; sister Octavia, who first had to be legally transferred to another family to obviate charges of incest. By then, it became clear that Nero was the unambiguous designate. His stepbrother became more politically active following his marriage to Octavia. He exempted the people of Ilium from all public burdens by arguing that Rome was descended from Troy through Aeneas (the founder of the Julian line), procured funds for the colony of Bononia (now Bologna, Italy), which had been devastated by fire, and the people of Rhodes had their freedom restored. Meanwhile, Britannicus himself was kept in reserve in case Nero, who was widely seen as the heir, died.

==Death of Claudius==
Historian Suetonius reports that Claudius wished Rome to have a &quot;real Caesar&quot;, and Britannicus enjoyed support from Claudius&#x27; loyal and influential freedman Narcissus. There are possible signs of support for Britannicus seen on coins from Moesia and North Africa that placed Britannicus&#x27; head and title on the obverse side. Claudius became aware of his wife&#x27;s actions and began preparing for the end of her power. His father wished to bestow upon him the toga and to declare Britannicus as his heir. According to Suetonius, when Claudius mentioned his intention to give Britannicus the toga of manhood, he said, &quot;That the Roman people may at last have a genuine Caesar.&quot;

The actions that Claudius took to preserve his rule in the short term were not easily undone as Britannicus approached manhood. In late 54, Britannicus was within six months of reaching manhood by Roman tradition and had matured early. According to Suetonius, Claudius began to mention divorcing Agrippina and dismissing Nero now that he was no longer needed. Suetonius reports that Claudius now admonished his son to grow up quickly, which implied that everything would be righted when he assumed the toga virilis.

On 13 October 54, Claudius died by natural causes or poison. In the accounts of his death by poison, Agrippina, aware of Claudius&#x27; intentions of placing Britannicus on the throne, had a well-known poisoner, Locusta, infuse mushrooms with poison that were fed to the emperor.

There were those who preferred Britannicus over Nero, such as Claudius&#x27; freedman Narcissus. Unfortunately for his cause, Narcissus was away in Campania when the emperor was poisoned, and Britannicus and his sisters, Octavia and Antonia, were kept out of sight in their rooms by Agrippina. Consequently, none could challenge Nero&#x27;s succession. If one thought that Britannicus&#x27; claim should take precedence, the response was that Nero too was the son of Claudius, with Agrippina linking him back to Augustus. It did not help that many were convinced that Britannicus was no longer in the line of succession, a direct effect of the propaganda against him by Agrippina. Nero spoke the eulogy at the emperor&#x27;s funeral and took sole power. Claudius&#x27; new will, which either granted joint rule to Britannicus and Nero or sole rule Britannicus, was suppressed by the new emperor&#x27;s men in the Senate.

==Downfall and death==

Immediately after the death of Claudius, Agrippina set upon removing those she had seen as a threat. Marcus Junius Silanus, proconsul of Asia whose brother Lucius had been eliminated by her as well, was poisoned for no other reason than that he had been the great-great-grandson of Augustus. Claudius&#x27; freedman Narcissus, Britannicus&#x27; champion according to Tacitus, had been driven to suicide after a harsh imprisonment. In Tacitus XIII, that was carried out by Agrippina against the wishes of Nero.

Before Nero&#x27;s consulship in 55, he had forbidden the persecution of a Julius Densus, an equestrian whose partiality for Britannicus had been construed as a crime.

During his consulship, Nero had become more independent from his mother&#x27;s influence. He began a relationship with a slave girl, and removed Pallas, a favourite of Agrippina, from his post as secretary of the treasury. In response, Agrippina threatened to champion the cause of Britannicus to keep her son in line. In the account of Tacitus, Agrippina says to Nero:

Tacitus recounts Nero&#x27;s numerous attempts to undermine Britannicus&#x27; image publicly. In one such attempt, during the feast of Saturn (the Saturnalia), he and Nero were playing a game among a group of their friends, and Nero chose Britannicus to sing a song with the expectation that Britannicus would embarrass himself. Britannicus, however, not only avoided humiliation but also generated sympathy amongst the guests by singing a poem telling the tale of how he had been cast aside in favour of Nero. The young emperor immediately began plotting his stepbrother&#x27;s assassination.

According to Suetonius, Nero moved against Britannicus, employing the same poisoner, Locusta, who had been hired to murder his father, Claudius. The first dose failed, and Nero decided to throw caution to the wind. In the account of Suetonius, he had Locusta brought to his room to mix a faster acting poison before his very eyes. After many tests on kids, there was a mixture that killed an animal instantly. Being pleased, Nero had the concoction brought immediately to the dining room.

Britannicus was poisoned at a dinner party attended by his sister, Octavia, Agrippina and several other notables. Tacitus&#x27; account of the event is that Britannicus was given a hot drink, which was tested by a food taster, and when he asked for it to be cooled, the poison was added to it with the cold water. The substance was instantly effective, and he &quot;lost alike both voice and breath&quot;. Nero claimed to those present that Britannicus was merely experiencing an epileptic seizure and that he had been affected by the condition since childhood. He died sometime between December 54 and 11 February 55, the day before his 14th birthday, when he was to assume manhood, just four months after his father&#x27;s death. For her service, the emperor had Locusta rewarded with large estates and even sent her pupils.

There is a theory that Britannicus was not poisoned but died of a seizure.

==Post mortem==
Britannicus was cremated and his ashes placed with those of his father in the Mausoleum of Augustus. Nero held his funeral the very next day in the rain and gave no eulogy, saying it was &quot;a tradition in the case of untimely deaths not to oppress the public with eulogies and processions.&quot; Dio states that Nero had the corpse covered in gypsum to cover the effects of the poison on the skin. While he was being carried through the Forum, the rain had uncovered the body, making plain to all who could see that he had been poisoned. The author and historian Beacham considers Dio&#x27;s account to be &quot;theatrical&quot;.

Britannicus was said to have criticised Nero&#x27;s singing voice, and referred to his adoptive brother by his original name of Lucius Domitius. In favouring Nero, Claudius sealed the fate of his son and perhaps his own. Ominously for Agrippina, Seneca and Burrus did not complain: either they had been bought off or regarded Britannicus&#x27; death as inevitable given his relationship with Nero. Instead, they concentrated on growing their influence with the new emperor.

According to Suetonius, Britannicus was good friends with the future Emperor Titus, whose father, Vespasian, had commanded legions in Britain. As part of the Flavians&#x27; attempts to link themselves with the Julio-Claudians, Titus claimed that he had been seated with Britannicus on the night he was killed. He even claimed to have tasted the poison, which resulted in a serious and long illness. Titus would go on to erect a gold statue of his childhood friend and issue coins in his memory.

==Cultural depictions==
Britannicus is portrayed in &quot;Britannicus&quot; (1669) by French playwright Jean Racine.

He was played by Graham Seed in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, a 1976 television series by Jack Pulman.

<doc id="75074" wikidata="Q806677" url="?curid=75074" title="Bank of Credit and Commerce International">
<text>The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) was an international bank founded in 1972 by Agha Hasan Abedi, a Pakistani financier. The bank was registered in Luxembourg with head offices in Karachi and London. A decade after opening, BCCI had over 4000 branches in 78 countries and assets in excess of US$20 billion, making it the seventh largest private bank in the world.

BCCI came under the scrutiny of financial regulators and intelligence agencies in the 1980s, due to concerns that it was poorly regulated. Subsequent investigations revealed that it was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes, and had illegally gained controlling interest in a major American bank. BCCI became the focus of a massive regulatory battle in 1991, and, on 5 July of that year, customs and bank regulators in seven countries raided and locked down records of its branch offices during Operation C-Chase.

Investigators in the United States and the UK determined that BCCI had been &quot;set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection&quot;.

The liquidators, Deloitte &amp; Touche, filed a lawsuit against the bank&#x27;s auditors, Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young, which was settled for $175 million in 1998. By 2013, Deloitte &amp; Touche claimed to have recovered about 75% of the creditors&#x27; lost money.

BCCI continues to be cited as a lesson to be heeded by leading figures in the world of finance and banking. In March 2023, the United States&#x27; Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael J. Hsu stated that &quot;there are strong parallels between FTX and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, better known in bank regulatory circles as BCCI, which failed in 1991 and led to significant changes in how global banks are supervised.&quot;

==History==
BCCI&#x27;s founder, Agha Hasan Abedi, established the bank in 1972. Abedi, a prolific banker, had previously set up the United Bank Limited in Pakistan in 1959 sponsored by Saigols. Preceding the nationalization of the United Bank in 1974, he sought to create a new supranational banking entity. BCCI was created with capital of which 25% was from Bank of America and the remaining 75% from Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.

BCCI expanded rapidly in the 1970s, pursuing long-term asset growth over profits, seeking high-net-worth individuals and regular large deposits. The company itself divided into BCCI Holdings with the bank under that splitting into BCCI SA (Luxembourg) and BCCI Overseas (Grand Cayman). BCCI also acquired parallel banks through acquisitions: buying the Banque de Commerce et Placements (BCP) of Geneva in 1976, and creating KIFCO (Kuwait International Finance Company), Credit &amp; Finance Corporation Ltd, and a series of Cayman-based companies held together as ICIC (International Credit and Investment Company Overseas, International Credit and Commerce [Overseas], etc.). Overall, BCCI expanded from 19 branches in five countries in 1973 to 27 branches in 1974 and 108 branches by 1976, with assets growing from $200 million to $1.6 billion. This growth caused extensive underlying capital problems. &quot;The Guardian&quot; alleged that BCCI was using cash from deposits to fund operating expenses, rather than making investments. Investigative journalist and author Joseph J. Trento has argued that the bank&#x27;s transformation was guided by the head of Saudi intelligence with a view to enabling it to finance covert American intelligence operations at a time, in the aftermath of Watergate, when the American intelligence agencies were defending themselves from investigations by domestic authorities. 

In 1973, the BCCI applied for an offshore banking licence in Singapore that was rejected by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on the basis that the bank was too new at just a year old and low in capitalisation. In 1980, they attempted to reapply but were yet again turned down by the MAS on the basis of its weak international regard.

BCCI entered the African markets in 1979, and Asia in the early 1980s. BCCI was among the first foreign banks awarded a license to operate in the Chinese Shenzhen Special Economic Zone which bore testament to Agha Hasan Abedi&#x27;s public relations skills, a feat that had yet to be achieved by the likes of Citicorp and JP Morgan. Some of China&#x27;s largest state banks were depositors in BCCI&#x27;s Shenzhen branch.

There was rigid compartmentalization; the 248 managers and general managers reported directly to Abedi and the CEO Swaleh Naqvi. It was structured in such a way that no single country had overall regulatory supervision over it so as not to hinder potential growth and expansion opportunities. Its two holding companies were based in Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands two jurisdictions where banking regulation was notoriously weak. It was also not regulated by a country that had a central bank. On several occasions, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that regulates national banks, told the Federal Reserve in no uncertain terms that BCCI must not be allowed to buy any American bank because it was poorly regulated.

By 1980, BCCI was reported to have assets of over $4 billion with over 150 branches in 46 countries. Bank of America was &quot;bewildered&quot; by BCCI and reduced its holding in 1980, and the company came to be held by a number of groups, with International Credit and Investment Corp (&#x27;ICIC&#x27;) owning 70%. By 1989, ICIC&#x27;s shareholding was reduced to 11% with Abu Dhabi groups holding almost 40%. However, large numbers of shares were held by BCCI nominees.

In 1982, 15 Middle Eastern investors bought Financial General Bankshares, a large bank holding company headquartered in Washington, D.C. All the investors were BCCI clients, but the Fed received assurances that BCCI would be in no way involved in the management of the company, which was renamed First American Bankshares. To alleviate regulators&#x27; concerns, Clark Clifford, an adviser to five presidents, was named First American&#x27;s chairman. Clifford headed a board composed of himself and several other distinguished American citizens, including former United States Senator Stuart Symington. In truth, BCCI had been involved in the purchase of FGB/First American from the beginning. Abedi had been approached about buying it as early as 1977, but by this time BCCI&#x27;s reputation in the United States was so poor that it could not hope to buy an American bank on its own (as mentioned above, the OCC was adamantly opposed to BCCI&#x27;s being allowed to buy its way into the American banking industry). Rather, it used the First American investors as nominees. Moreover, Clifford&#x27;s law firm was retained as general counsel, and also handled most of BCCI&#x27;s American legal work. BCCI was also heavily involved in First American personnel matters. The relationship between the two was so close that rumors spread BCCI was the real owner of First American.

BCCI had an unusual annual auditing system: Price Waterhouse were the accountants for BCCI Overseas, while Ernst &amp; Young audited BCCI and BCCI Holdings (London and Luxembourg). Other companies such as KIFCO and ICIC were audited by neither. In October 1985, the Bank of England and the Monetary Institute of Luxembourg (Luxembourg&#x27;s bank regulator) ordered BCCI to change to a single accountant, alarmed at reported BCCI losses on the commodities and financial markets. Price Waterhouse became the bank&#x27;s sole accountant in 1987.

In 1990, a Price Waterhouse audit of BCCI revealed an unaccountable loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. The bank approached Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who made good the loss in exchange for an increased shareholding of 78%. Much of BCCI&#x27;s documentation was then transferred to Abu Dhabi. The audit also revealed numerous irregularities. Most seriously, BCCI had made a staggering $1.48 billion worth of loans to its own shareholders, who used BCCI stock as collateral.

The audit also confirmed what many Americans who watched BCCI long suspected that BCCI secretly (and illegally) owned First American. When the Fed cleared the group of Arab investors to buy First American, it did so on condition that they supplement their personal funds with money borrowed from banks with no connection to BCCI. Contrary to that agreement, several stockholders had borrowed heavily from BCCI. Even more seriously, they pledged their First American stock as collateral. When they failed to make interest payments, BCCI took control of the shares. It was later estimated that in this manner, BCCI had ended up with 60% or more of First American&#x27;s stock.

Despite these problems, Price Waterhouse signed BCCI&#x27;s 1989 annual report, largely due to Zayed&#x27;s firm commitment to propping up the bank. Abedi was succeeded by Swaleh Naqvi as the bank&#x27;s chief, who, in the aftermath following controversy over BCCI, was replaced by Zafar Iqbal Chaudhry in the late 1980s.

==Lending practices==
BCCI contended that its growth was fueled by the increasingly large number of deposits by oil-rich states that owned stock in the bank as well as by sovereign developing nations. However, this claim failed to mollify the regulators. For example, the Bank of England ordered BCCI to cap its branch network in the United Kingdom at 45 branches.

There was particular concern over BCCI&#x27;s loan portfolio, because of its roots in areas where modern banking was still an alien concept. For instance, a large number of its customers were devout Muslims who are against charging interest on loans a major pillar of modern banking because they consider it to be &quot;riba&quot;, or usury. In many third-world countries, a person&#x27;s financial standing did not matter as much as his relationship with his banker. One particularly notable example is the Gokal family, a prominent family of shipping magnates. The three Gokal brothers, Abbas, Mustafa and Murtaza, were owners of the Gulf Group. They had a relationship with Abedi dating back to his days at United Bank. Abedi personally handled their loans, with little regard for details such as loan documents or creditworthiness. At one point, BCCI&#x27;s loans to the Gokal companies were equivalent to US$1.2 billion, three times the bank&#x27;s capital. The case of Nazmu Virani, the UK based property tycoon who borrowed £500 million unsecured, which was widely reported. Longstanding banking practice dictates that a bank not lend more than 10% of its capital to a single customer.

==Money laundering==
In addition to violations of lending laws, BCCI was also accused of opening accounts or laundering money for figures such as Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Muhammad Ershad, and Samuel Doe, and for criminal organizations such as the Medellín Cartel and Abu Nidal. Police and intelligence experts nicknamed BCCI the &quot;Bank of Crooks and Criminals International&quot; for its penchant for catering to customers who dealt in arms, drugs, and hot money. Both Syed A. Hussain (b. 1960 or 1961) and Amjad Awan, (b. 1946 or 1947) a Pakistani banker that headed the Panamanian branch of BCCI in the early 1980s, assisted Noriega with Noriega&#x27;s accounts at BCCI.

William von Raab, a former U.S. Commissioner of Customs, also told the Kerry Committee that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency held &quot;several&quot; accounts at BCCI. According to a 1991 article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the National Security Council also had accounts at BCCI, which were used for a variety of covert operations, including transfers of money and weapons during the Iran–Contra affair. In 1991, due to Congressional oversight, the CIA admitted that it was aware of BCCI&#x27;s illegal money laundering activities related to drugs.

==Investigations begin==
BCCI&#x27;s demise began in 1986, when a U.S. Customs undercover operation led by Special Agent Robert Mazur infiltrated the bank&#x27;s private client division at Tampa, Florida, and uncovered their active role soliciting deposits from drug traffickers and money launderers. This two-year undercover operation concluded in 1988 with a fake wedding that was attended by BCCI officers and drug dealers from around the world, who had established a personal friendship and working relationship with undercover agent Mazur. At the same time he was dealing undercover with BCCI executives, Mazur used his undercover operation to establish a relationship with the hierarchy of the Medellín Cartel as one of their sources for laundering drug proceeds. Mazur&#x27;s and others&#x27; roles in the sting operation were highlighted in the film &quot;The Infiltrator&quot; (2016).

In 1988, the bank was implicated as the center of a major money laundering scheme. After a six-month trial, BCCI, under immense pressure from U.S. authorities, pleaded guilty in 1990, but only on the grounds of &quot;respondeat superior&quot;. While federal regulators took no action, Florida regulators forced BCCI to pull out of the state.

In 1990, U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch presented an impassioned defense of the bank in a speech on the Senate floor. He and his aide, Michael Pillsbury, were involved in efforts to counter the negative publicity that surrounded the bank, and Hatch solicited the bank to approve a $10 million loan to a close friend, Monzer Hourani.

==Sandstorm report==
In March 1991, the Bank of England asked Price Waterhouse to carry out an inquiry. On 24 June 1991, using the code name &quot;Sandstorm&quot; for BCCI, Price Waterhouse submitted the Sandstorm report showing that BCCI had engaged in &quot;widespread fraud and manipulation&quot; that made it difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct BCCI&#x27;s financial history.

The Sandstorm report, parts of which were leaked to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, included details of how the Abu Nidal terrorist group had manipulated details and through using fake identities had opened accounts at BCCI&#x27;s Sloane Street branch in London. Britain&#x27;s internal security service, MI5, had signed up two sources inside the branch to hand over copies of all documents relating to Abu Nidal&#x27;s accounts. One source was the Syrian-born branch manager, Ghassan Qassem, the second a young British employee.

The Abu Nidal link man for the BCCI accounts was a man based in Iraq named Samir Najmeddin or Najmedeen. Throughout the 1980s, BCCI had set up millions of dollars worth of letters of credit for Najmeddin, largely for arms deals with Iraq. Qassem later swore in an affidavit that Najmeddin was often accompanied by an American, whom Qassem subsequently identified as the financier Marc Rich. Rich was later indicted in the United States for tax evasion and racketeering in an apparently unrelated case and fled the country.

Qassem also told reporters that he had once escorted Abu Nidal, who was allegedly using the name Shakir Farhan, around town to buy a tie, without realizing who he was. This revelation led in 1991 to one of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;″s best-known front-page headlines: &quot;I Took Abu Nidal Shopping&quot;.

==Forced closure==
BCCI was awaiting final approval for a restructuring plan in which it would have re-emerged as the &quot;Oasis Bank&quot;. However, after the Sandstorm report, regulators concluded BCCI was so fraught with problems that it had to be seized. It had already been ordered to shut down its American operations in March for its illegal control of First American.

On 5 July 1991, regulators persuaded a court in Luxembourg to order BCCI liquidated on the grounds that it was hopelessly insolvent. According to the court order, BCCI had lost more than its entire capital and reserves the year before. At 1 pm London time that day (8 am in New York City), regulators marched into BCCI&#x27;s offices and shut them down. Around a million depositors were immediately affected by this action.

On 7 July 1991, Hong Kong Office of the Commissioner of Banking (predecessor
of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority) ordered BCCI to shut down its business in Hong Kong on the grounds that BCCI had problem loans and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, the major shareholder of BCCI, refused to provide funds to the Hong Kong BCCI. Hong Kong BCCI was liquidated on 17 July 1991.

A few weeks after the seizure, on 29 July, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau announced that a Manhattan grand jury had indicted BCCI, Abedi and Naqvi on twelve counts of fraud, money laundering, and larceny. Morgenthau, who had been investigating BCCI for over two years, claimed jurisdiction because millions of dollars laundered by the bank flowed through Manhattan. Also, Morgenthau cited BCCI&#x27;s secret ownership of First American, which operated a subsidiary in New York City. Morgenthau said that all of BCCI&#x27;s deposits had been fraudulently collected because the bank misled depositors about its ownership structure and financial condition. He described BCCI as &quot;the largest bank fraud in world financial history&quot;.

On 15 November, BCCI, Abedi and Naqvi were indicted on federal charges that it had illegally bought control of another American bank, Independence Bank of Los Angeles, using Saudi businessman Ghaith Pharaon as the puppet owner.

Just a month later, BCCI&#x27;s liquidators (Deloitte, PWC) pleaded guilty to all criminal charges pending against the bank in the United States (both those lodged by the federal government and by Morgenthau), clearing the way for BCCI&#x27;s formal liquidation that fall. BCCI paid $10 million in fines and forfeited all $550 million of its American assets at the time, the largest single criminal forfeiture ever obtained by federal prosecutors. The money was used to repay losses to First American and Independence and to make restitution to BCCI&#x27;s depositors. None of this was enough to rescue both banks, however; Independence was seized later in 1992, while First American was forced into a sale to First Union in 1993.

Many of the major players in the scandal have never been brought to trial in American or UK courts. Abedi, for example, died in 1995. He was under indictment in the United States and UK for crimes related to BCCI, but Pakistani officials refused to give him up for extradition because they felt the charges were politically motivated. Even without this to consider, he had been in poor health since suffering a stroke in the 1980s. Pharaon remained a fugitive until his death in 2017.

In 2002, Denis Robert and Ernest Backes, former number three of financial clearing house Clearstream, discovered that BCCI had continued to maintain its activities after its official closure, with microfiches of Clearstream&#x27;s illegal unpublished accounts.

Estimates of financial losses range from $10 billion to $17 billion, though some of it has been recovered by the bank&#x27;s liquidators, Deloitte &amp; Touche.

==American inquiries and legal actions==

In 1991, Robert Mueller declared the government had been investigating BCCI since 1986 resulting in intense media coverage.

In 1992, United States Senators John Kerry and Hank Brown became the co-authors of a report on BCCI, which was delivered to the Committee on Foreign Relations. The BCCI scandal was one of a number of disasters that influenced thinking leading to the Public Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA) of 1998. The report found that Clifford and his legal/business partner Robert A. Altman had been closely involved with the bank from 1978, when they were introduced to BCCI by Bert Lance, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget, to 1991. Earlier, Pharaon was revealed to have been the puppet owner of National Bank of Georgia, a bank formerly owned by Lance before being sold back to First American (it had previously been an FGB subsidiary before Lance bought it). Clifford and Altman testified that they had never observed any suspicious activity, and had themselves been deceived about BCCI&#x27;s control of First American. However, the federal government and Morgenthau contended that the two men knew, or should have known, that BCCI controlled First American. Pharaon also was revealed to be the puppet controlling owner of CenTrust Bank in Miami, Florida.

Morgenthau and the federal government brought indictments against Clifford and Altman, but did not pursue Clifford due to his age and deteriorating health (he died in 1998). Altman was indicted and tried in New York, though he was ultimately acquitted following a jury verdict of not guilty. Altman later accepted a de-facto lifetime ban from any role in the banking industry to settle a civil suit by the Fed.

==British inquiry and litigation==
The British government set up an independent inquiry, chaired by Lord Justice Bingham, in 1992. Its House of Commons Paper, &quot;Inquiry into the Supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International,&quot; was published in October of that year. Following the report, BCCI liquidators Deloitte Touche filed suit against the Bank of England for £850m, claiming that the Bank was guilty of misfeasance in public office. The suit lasted 12 years. It ended in November 2005, when Deloitte withdrew its claims after England&#x27;s High Court ruled that it was &quot;no longer in the best interests of creditors&quot; for the litigation to continue. Deloitte eventually paid the Bank of England £73m for its legal costs. According to news reports at the time, it was the most expensive case in British legal history.

==Litigation elsewhere==
Although major litigation has ended in the case, suits and legal actions relating to the bank were still being brought in 2013, over 20 years after the bank&#x27;s failure.

<text>The haloalkanes (also known as halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are alkanes containing one or more halogen substituents. They are a subset of the general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially. They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguishants, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes that contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter. For more information, see Halomethane. Haloalkane or alkyl halides are the compounds which have the general formula &quot;RX&quot; where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).

Haloalkanes have been known for centuries. Chloroethane was produced in the 15th century. The systematic synthesis of such compounds developed in the 19th century in step with the development of organic chemistry and the understanding of the structure of alkanes. Methods were developed for the selective formation of C-halogen bonds. Especially versatile methods included the addition of halogens to alkenes, hydrohalogenation of alkenes, and the conversion of alcohols to alkyl halides. These methods are so reliable and so easily implemented that haloalkanes became cheaply available for use in industrial chemistry because the halide could be further replaced by other functional groups.

While many haloalkanes are human-produced, substantial amounts are biogenic.

==Classes==
From the structural perspective, haloalkanes can be classified according to the connectivity of the carbon atom to which the halogen is attached. In primary (1°) haloalkanes, the carbon that carries the halogen atom is only attached to one other alkyl group. An example is chloroethane (). In secondary (2°) haloalkanes, the carbon that carries the halogen atom has two C–C bonds. In tertiary (3°) haloalkanes, the carbon that carries the halogen atom has three C–C bonds.

Haloalkanes can also be classified according to the type of halogen on group 17 responding to a specific halogenoalkane. Haloalkanes containing carbon bonded to fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine results in organofluorine, organochlorine, organobromine and organoiodine compounds, respectively. Compounds containing more than one kind of halogen are also possible. Several classes of widely used haloalkanes are classified in this way chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). These abbreviations are particularly common in discussions of the environmental impact of haloalkanes.

==Properties==
Haloalkanes generally resemble the parent alkanes in being colorless, relatively odorless, and hydrophobic. The melting and boiling points of chloro-, bromo-, and iodoalkanes are higher than the analogous alkanes, scaling with the atomic weight and number of halides. This effect is due to the increased strength of the intermolecular forces—from London dispersion to dipole-dipole interaction because of the increased polarizability. Thus tetraiodomethane () is a solid whereas tetrachloromethane () is a liquid. Many fluoroalkanes, however, go against this trend and have lower melting and boiling points than their nonfluorinated analogues due to the decreased polarizability of fluorine. For example, methane () has a melting point of −182.5 °C whereas tetrafluoromethane () has a melting point of −183.6 °C.

As they contain fewer C–H bonds, haloalkanes are less flammable than alkanes, and some are used in fire extinguishers. Haloalkanes are better solvents than the corresponding alkanes because of their increased polarity. Haloalkanes containing halogens other than fluorine are more reactive than the parent alkanes—it is this reactivity that is the basis of most controversies. Many are alkylating agents, with primary haloalkanes and those containing heavier halogens being the most active (fluoroalkanes do not act as alkylating agents under normal conditions). The ozone-depleting abilities of the CFCs arises from the photolability of the C–Cl bond.

==Natural occurrence==
An estimated 4,100,000,000 kg of chloromethane are produced annually by natural sources. The oceans are estimated to release 1 to 2 million tons of bromomethane annually.

==Nomenclature==
===IUPAC===
The formal naming of haloalkanes should follow IUPAC nomenclature, which put the halogen as a prefix to the alkane. For example, ethane with bromine becomes bromoethane, methane with four chlorine groups becomes tetrachloromethane. However, many of these compounds have already an established trivial name, which is endorsed by the IUPAC nomenclature, for example chloroform (trichloromethane) and methylene chloride (dichloromethane). But nowadays, IUPAC nomenclature is used. To reduce confusion this article follows the systematic naming scheme throughout.

==Production==
Haloalkanes can be produced from virtually all organic precursors. From the perspective of industry, the most important ones are alkanes and alkenes.

===From alkanes===

Alkanes react with halogens by free radical halogenation. In this reaction a hydrogen atom is removed from the alkane, then replaced by a halogen atom by reaction with a diatomic halogen molecule. Free radical halogenation typically produces a mixture of compounds mono- or multihalogenated at various positions.

===From alkenes and alkynes===
In hydrohalogenation, an alkene reacts with a dry hydrogen halide (HX) electrophile like hydrogen chloride () or hydrogen bromide () to form a mono-haloalkane. The double bond of the alkene is replaced by two new bonds, one with the halogen and one with the hydrogen atom of the hydrohalic acid. Markovnikov&#x27;s rule states that under normal conditions, hydrogen is attached to the unsaturated carbon with the most hydrogen substituents. The rule is violated when neighboring functional groups polarize the multiple bond, or in certain additions of hydrogen bromide (addition in the presence of peroxides and the Wohl-Ziegler reaction) which occur by a free-radical mechanism.

Alkenes also react with halogens (X2) to form haloalkanes with two neighboring halogen atoms in a halogen addition reaction. Alkynes react similarly, forming the tetrahalo compounds. This is sometimes known as &quot;decolorizing&quot; the halogen, since the reagent X2 is colored and the product is usually colorless and odorless.

===From alcohols===
Alcohol can be converted to haloalkanes. Direct reaction with a hydrohalic acid rarely gives a pure product, instead generating ethers. However, some exceptions are known: ionic liquids suppress the formation or promote the cleavage of ethers, hydrochloric acid converts tertiary alcohols to choloroalkanes, and primary and secondary alcohols convert similarly in the presence of a Lewis acid activator, such as zinc chloride. The latter is exploited in the Lucas test.

In the laboratory, more active deoxygenating and halogenating agents combine with base to effect the conversion. In the &quot;Darzens halogenation&quot;, thionyl chloride () with pyridine converts less reactive alcohols to chlorides. Both phosphorus pentachloride () and phosphorus trichloride () function similarly, and alcohols convert to bromoalkanes under hydrobromic acid or phosphorus tribromide (PBr3). The heavier halogens do not require preformed reagents: A catalytic amount of may be used for the transformation using phosphorus and bromine; is formed &quot;in situ&quot;. Iodoalkanes may similarly be prepared using red phosphorus and iodine (equivalent to phosphorus triiodide).

One family of named reactions relies on the deoxygenating effect of triphenylphosphine. In the Appel reaction, the reagent is tetrahalomethane and triphenylphosphine; the co-products are haloform and triphenylphosphine oxide. In the Mitsunobu reaction, the reagents are any nucleophile, triphenylphosphine, and a diazodicarboxylate; the coproducts are triphenyl­phosphine oxide and a hydrazodiamide.

===From carboxylic acids===
Two methods for the synthesis of haloalkanes from carboxylic acids are Hunsdiecker reaction and Kochi reaction.

===Biosynthesis===
Many chloro- and bromoalkanes are formed naturally. The principal pathways involve the enzymes chloroperoxidase and bromoperoxidase.

==== From amines by Sandmeyer&#x27;s Method ====

Primary aromatic amines yield diazonium ions in a solution of sodium nitrite. Upon heating this solution with copper(I) chloride, the diazonium group is replaced by -Cl. This is a comparatively easy method to make aryl halides as the gaseous product can be separated easily from aryl halide.

When an iodide is to be made, copper chloride is not needed. Addition of potassium iodide with gentle shaking produces the haloalkane.

==Reactions==
Haloalkanes are reactive towards nucleophiles. They are polar molecules: the carbon to which the halogen is attached is slightly electropositive where the halogen is slightly electronegative. This results in an electron deficient (electrophilic) carbon which, inevitably, attracts nucleophiles.

===Substitution===
Substitution reactions involve the replacement of the halogen with another molecule—thus leaving saturated hydrocarbons, as well as the halogenated product. Haloalkanes behave as the R+ synthon, and readily react with nucleophiles.

Hydrolysis, a reaction in which water breaks a bond, is a good example of the nucleophilic nature of haloalkanes. The polar bond attracts a hydroxide ion, OH− (NaOH(aq) being a common source of this ion). This OH− is a nucleophile with a clearly negative charge, as it has excess electrons it donates them to the carbon, which results in a covalent bond between the two. Thus C–X is broken by heterolytic fission resulting in a halide ion, X−. As can be seen, the OH is now attached to the alkyl group, creating an alcohol. (Hydrolysis of bromoethane, for example, yields ethanol). Reactions with ammonia give primary amines.

Chloro- and bromoalkanes are readily substituted by iodide in the Finkelstein reaction. The iodoalkanes produced easily undergo further reaction. Sodium iodide is used as a catalyst.

Haloalkanes react with ionic nucleophiles (e.g. cyanide, thiocyanate, azide); the halogen is replaced by the respective group. This is of great synthetic utility: chloroalkanes are often inexpensively available. For example, after undergoing substitution reactions, cyanoalkanes may be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids, or reduced to primary amines using lithium aluminium hydride. Azoalkanes may be reduced to primary amines by Staudinger reduction or lithium aluminium hydride. Amines may also be prepared from alkyl halides in amine alkylation, Gabriel synthesis and Delepine reaction, by undergoing nucleophilic substitution with potassium phthalimide or hexamine respectively, followed by hydrolysis.

In the presence of a base, haloalkanes alkylate alcohols, amines, and thiols to obtain ethers, &quot;N&quot;-substituted amines, and thioethers respectively. They are substituted by Grignard reagent to give magnesium salts and an extended alkyl compound.

===Elimination===

In dehydrohalogenation reactions, the halogen and an adjacent proton are removed from halocarbons, thus forming an alkene. For example, with bromoethane and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in ethanol, the hydroxide ion HO− abstracts a hydrogen atom. A Bromide ion is then lost, resulting in ethene, H2O and NaBr. Thus, haloalkanes can be converted to alkenes. Similarly, dihaloalkanes can be converted to alkynes.

In related reactions, 1,2-dibromocompounds are debrominated by zinc dust to give alkenes and geminal dihalides can react with strong bases to give carbenes.

===Other===
Haloalkanes undergo free-radical reactions with elemental magnesium to give alkyl-magnesium compound: Grignard reagent. Haloalkanes also react with lithium metal to give organolithium compounds. Both Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds behave as the R− synthon. Alkali metals such as sodium and lithium are able to cause haloalkanes to couple in Wurtz reaction, giving symmetrical alkanes. Haloalkanes, especially iodoalkanes, also undergo oxidative addition reactions to give organometallic compounds.

==Applications==

Chlorinated or fluorinated alkenes undergo polymerization. Important halogenated polymers include polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE, or teflon).

;Alkyl fluorides: An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Most of these compounds are alkyl fluorides. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine and fluconazole. Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane.

;Alkyl chlorides: Some low molecular weight chlorinated hydrocarbons such as chloroform, dichloromethane, dichloroethene, and trichloroethane are useful solvents. Several million tons of chlorinated methanes are produced annually. Chloromethane is a precursor to chlorosilanes and silicones. Chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2) is used to make teflon.

;Alkyl bromides: Large scale applications of alkyl bromides exploit their toxicity, which also limits their usefulness. Methyl bromide is also an effective fumigant, but its production and use are controversial.

;Alkyl iodides: No large scale applications are known for alkyl iodides. Methyl iodide is a popular methylating agent in organic synthesis.

;Chlorofluorocarbons: Chlorofluorocarbons were used almost universally as refrigerants and propellants due to their relatively low toxicity and high heat of vaporization. Starting in the 1980s, as their contribution to ozone depletion became known, their use was increasingly restricted, and they have now largely been replaced by HFCs.

==Environmental considerations==
Nature produces massive amounts of chloromethane and bromomethane. Most concern focuses on anthropogenic sources, which are potential toxins, even carcinogens. Similarly, great interest has been shown in remediation of man made halocarbons such as those produced on large scale, such as dry cleaning fluids. Volatile halocarbons degrade photochemically because the carbon-halogen bond can be labile. Some microorganisms dehalogenate halocarbons. While this behavior is intriguing, the rates of remediation are generally very slow.

==Safety==
As alkylating agents, haloalkanes are potential carcinogens. The more reactive members of this large class of compounds generally pose greater risk, e.g. carbon tetrachloride.

<text>Sir Frederick Grant Banting (November 14, 1891 – February 21, 1941) was a Canadian pharmacologist, orthopedist, and field surgeon. For his co-discovery of insulin and its therapeutic potential, Banting was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with John Macleod.

Banting and his student, Charles Best, isolated insulin at the University of Toronto in the lab of Scottish physiologist John Macleod. When he and Macleod received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, Banting shared the honours and award money with Best. That same year, the government of Canada granted Banting a lifetime annuity to continue his work. Frederick Banting, who received the Nobel Prize at age 32, is the youngest Nobel laureate for Physiology/Medicine.

== Early life ==

Banting was born on November 14, 1891, in his family&#x27;s farmhouse in Essa, Ontario, two miles from nearby Alliston. He was the youngest of five children of William Thompson Banting, a farmer in Tecumseh, and Margaret Grant, the daughter of a mill manager. The Bantings were a financially stable family of British and Northern Irish origin. Banting&#x27;s distant relative, the London-based undertaker William Banting, popularised a weight-loss diet in 1864, and the word &quot;Banting&quot; entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as its description. His mother&#x27;s relatives, the Grants, were of Scottish descent.

With his family being located within a secure rural community, Banting was raised in prosperous circumstances. He was often called &quot;Fred&quot; or &quot;Freddie.&quot; Farm life largely defined most of his boyhood. He felt excluded from his siblings, all multiple years his senior, and recalled that &quot;my older brothers could not be bothered with me for the most part.&quot; When he began schooling at the age of seven in Alliston, Banting was a shy, asocial boy who tired of the attendance and was bullied frequently. Early difficulties with spelling ensured poor marks in exams: &quot;I simply could not spell. Every word seemed to have about three ways of spelling. It was a guess and I invariably guessed wrong.&quot; He later attributed these experiences as being the product of an inferiority complex.

During his childhood, Banting devoted himself to farmwork, grew close with his mother, and sympathised with animals in the absence of other company. Marion Walwyn, a cousin who first met Banting in 1901, recalled that &quot;we sat together in the swing in our yard. In an hour he didn&#x27;t say one word.&quot; He continued to struggle in school and stubbornly resisted being disciplined there. After one incident, he resolved never to continue his education but was convinced otherwise by his father. Banting&#x27;s grandfather, John Banting, had urged his own children to be educated; the philosophy had influenced William, who offered to provide a fund to his sons when they turned twenty-one. In contrast to his brothers, who spent the inheritance towards their own farms, Frederick would use it towards matriculation.

In his late teenage years, Banting grew into a tall man with engagements in school football and baseball teams. Both his mother and father hoped that he would find a vocation in the Methodist ministry. He passed physics and chemistry during junior matriculation examinations in 1909, but repeated English and was required to undertake French and Latin. The next year, he narrowly passed Latin but failed French and, for a second time, English composition. The principal later remembered his repeated efforts: &quot;We would not have picked him for one on whom fame should settle. He was a white boy, a right boy.&quot; 
=== College and service years ===
Banting finally passed examinations in July 1910. He stated on his application to university that he wished to be a teacher, although he also harbored aspirations of becoming a doctor. He toured the Canadian West for the summer, traveling to Winnipeg and Calgary, before enrolling at the University of Toronto, where he entered the General Arts course at Victoria College. Despite hard work, Banting failed his first year, but decided to become a doctor and returned to repeat the year. He petitioned to join the medical program in February 1912 and was accepted. In September, he dropped out of Victoria College to begin medical school at the University of Toronto.

Banting established himself in medical school by working diligently. His roommate, Sam Graham, remembered him for studying late into the night. Besides being a successful rugby player, however, he was otherwise undistinguished. His grades—now without the burden of language courses—saw a marked improvement, averaging approximately a B, an above-average score. Summers were spent returning to work at the farm. At Toronto&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine, Banting specialised in surgery.

At the onset of World War I, Banting, along with most Canadian men, sought to enlist in the army. He attempted to enter the Canadian Expeditionary Force on August 16, 1914, the day after Canada&#x27;s declaration of war, and then again in October, but was refused twice due to poor vision. In his third year of medical school Banting successfully joined the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1915 and was commissioned a private, then promoted to sergeant. He trained at a camp at Niagara Falls for the summer before his fourth year of school. The university accelerated the class by condensing the fifth year of medical school during the summer of 1916. The curriculum placed more emphasis on surgical procedure and trauma; a lecture dedicated to the treatment of diabetes derived itself from Frederick Madison Allen of the Rockefeller Institute, who recommended that diabetics be placed on a starvation diet for minimum metabolization.

Banting&#x27;s fourth year was committed to clinical work at Toronto General Hospital. Under the guidance of Clarence L. Starr, the chief surgeon at the Hospital for Sick Children, Banting gained training as an undergraduate house surgeon. By 1915, he had definitively resolved to practice surgery, performing his first operation—the drainage of a soldier&#x27;s abscess—next winter. On December 9, 1916, Banting graduated with his Bachelor of Medicine (M.B.) and reported for military duty the next day. After being promoted to lieutenant, he sailed from Halifax to Britain on March 26, 1917. Shortly before departing he became engaged to Edith Roach, whom he met in 1911. Starr, an orthopedist who enlisted in 1916, had been impressed by Banting&#x27;s work as an undergraduate and requested that he join him at the Granville Canadian Special Hospital in Ramsgate, Kent. On May 2, 1917, Banting assumed a position as Starr&#x27;s assistant.

For thirteen months, Banting assisted Starr, a pioneer of nerve suturing, at Granville Hospital. He oversaw 125 patients and refused to levy a fee for extra services: &quot;it gives me a certain amount of pleasure to be able to help them which repays me in a way that money never could.&quot; After some study, he gained certification in obstetrics and gynaecology, and was transferred to serve in France, arriving in June 1918. Banting&#x27;s first encounter with medical service came on August 8 at the Battle of Amiens. Several days were spent tending to and dressing the wounded on the front lines, in effect, as a general practitioner. In the lull between battles, Banting developed his knowledge of anatomy. Eager to see more active combat, he hoped to be deployed to Siberia with the Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force.

The 44th Battalion, 4th Canadian Division, where Banting served, were engaged at the Battle of Cambrai in 1918. He witnessed much of the battle&#x27;s brutality. When a German entered his aid post, Banting&#x27;s life was saved by a patient, an amputee sergeant, who shot the soldier at the post&#x27;s door. Later, Banting was struck by shrapnel from an exploding shell, ultimately ending his frontline duty. He wished to remain in battle to continue treating the wounded but his superior, Major L.C. Palmer, insisted otherwise. For his valour, Palmer would recommend Banting to be decorated. Banting was awarded the Military Cross owing to his &quot;exceptional bravery while attending the wounded under fire.&quot;

Banting returned to Canada after the war and went to Toronto to complete his surgical training. In 1918, he was awarded the license to practise medicine, surgery, and midwifery by the Royal College of Physicians of London. He studied orthopedic medicine and, in 1919–1920, was Resident Surgeon at The Hospital for Sick Children. Banting was unable to gain a place on the hospital staff and so he decided to move to London, Ontario, to set up a medical practice. From July 1920 to May 1921, he continued his general practice, while teaching orthopedics and anthropology part-time at the University of Western Ontario in London because his medical practice had not been particularly successful. From 1921 to 1922 he lectured in pharmacology at the University of Toronto. He received his M.D. degree in 1922, and was also awarded a gold medal.

== Medical research ==

=== Isolation of insulin ===

An article he read about the pancreas piqued Banting&#x27;s interest in diabetes. Banting had to give a talk on the pancreas to one of his classes at the University of Western Ontario on November 1, 1920, and he was therefore reading reports that other scientists had written. Research by Naunyn, Minkowski, Opie, Sharpey-Schafer, and others suggested that diabetes resulted from a lack of a protein hormone secreted by the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Schafer had named this putative hormone &quot;insulin&quot;. The hormone was thought to control the metabolism of sugar; its lack led to an increase of sugar in the blood which was then excreted in urine. Attempts to extract insulin from ground-up pancreas cells were unsuccessful, likely because of the destruction of the insulin by the proteolysis enzyme of the pancreas. The challenge was to find a way to extract insulin from the pancreas prior to its destruction.

Moses Barron published an article in 1920 which described experimental closure of the pancreatic duct by ligature; this further influenced Banting&#x27;s thinking. The procedure caused deterioration of the cells of the pancreas that secrete trypsin which breaks down insulin, but it left the islets of Langerhans intact. Banting realized that this procedure would destroy the trypsin-secreting cells but not the insulin. Once the trypsin-secreting cells had died, insulin could be extracted from the islets of Langerhans. Banting discussed this approach with John Macleod, professor of physiology at the University of Toronto. Macleod provided experimental facilities and the assistance of one of his students, Charles Best. Banting and Best, with the assistance of biochemist James Collip, began the production of insulin by this means.

As the experiments proceeded, the required quantities could no longer be obtained by performing surgery on living dogs. In November 1921, Banting hit upon the idea of obtaining insulin from the fetal pancreas. He removed the pancreases from fetal calves at a William Davies slaughterhouse and found the extracts to be just as potent as those extracted from the dog pancreases. By December 1921, he had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult pancreas. Pork and beef would remain the primary commercial sources of insulin until they were replaced by genetically engineered bacteria in the late 20th century. On January 11, 1922, the first ever injection of insulin was given to 14-year-old Canadian Leonard Thompson at Toronto General Hospital. In spring of 1922, Banting established a private practice in Toronto and began to treat diabetic patients. His first American patient was Elizabeth Hughes Gossett, daughter of U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes.

Banting and Macleod were jointly awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Banting split his half of the Prize money with Best, and Macleod split the other half of the Prize money with James Collip.

=== After insulin ===

Banting was appointed Senior Demonstrator in Medicine at the University of Toronto in 1922. Next year he was elected to the new Banting and Best Chair of Medical Research, endowed by the Legislature of the province of Ontario. He also served as Honorary Consulting Physician to the Toronto General, the Hospital for Sick Children, and the Toronto Western Hospital. At the Banting and Best Institute, he focused his research on silicosis, cancer, and the mechanisms of drowning.

In 1938, Banting&#x27;s interest in aviation medicine resulted in his participation with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in research concerning the physiological problems encountered by pilots operating high-altitude combat aircraft. Banting headed the RCAF&#x27;s Number 1 Clinical Investigation Unit (CIU), which was housed in a secret facility on the grounds of the former Eglinton Hunt Club in Toronto.

During the Second World War he investigated the problems of aviators, such as &quot;blackout&quot; (syncope). He also helped Wilbur Franks with the invention of the G-suit to stop pilots from blacking out when they were subjected to g-forces while turning or diving. Another of Banting&#x27;s projects during the Second World War involved using and treating mustard gas burns. Banting even tested the gas and antidotes on himself to see if they were effective.

== Public statements ==

=== Statements on Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company ===

During his 1927 Arctic trip with A. Y. Jackson, Banting realized that crew or passengers on board the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) paddle wheeler SS &quot;Distributor&quot; were responsible for spreading the influenza virus down the Slave River and Mackenzie River, a virus that had over the summer and autumn spread territory-wide, devastating the aboriginal population of the north. Returning from the trip, Banting gave an interview in Montreal with a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reporter under the agreement that his statements on HBC would remain off the record. The conversation was nonetheless published in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and rapidly reached a wide audience across Europe and Australia. Banting was angry at the leak, having promised the Department of the Interior not to make any statements to the press prior to clearing them.

The article noted that Banting had given the journalist C. R. Greenaway repeated instances of how the fox fur trade always favoured the company: &quot;For over $100,000 of fox skins, he estimated that the Eskimos had not received $5,000 worth of goods.&quot; He traced this treatment to health, consistent with reports made in previous years by RCMP officers, suggesting that &quot;the result was a diet of &#x27;flour, biscuits, tea and tobacco,&#x27; with the skins that once were used for clothing traded merely for &#x27;cheap whiteman&#x27;s goods.

The fur trade commissioner for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company called Banting&#x27;s remarks &quot;false and slanderous&quot;, and a month later, the governor and general manager of HBC met Banting at the King Edward Hotel to demand a retraction. Banting stated that the reporter had betrayed his confidence, but did not retract his statement and reaffirmed that HBC was responsible for the death of indigenous residents by supplying the wrong kind of food and introducing diseases into the Arctic. As A. Y. Jackson notes in his memoir, since neither the governor nor the general manager had been to the Arctic, the meeting ended with them asking Banting&#x27;s advice on what HBC ought to do: &quot;He gave them some good advice and later he received a card at Christmas with the Governor&#x27;s best wishes.&quot;

Banting also maintained this position in his report to the Department of the Interior:He noted that &quot;infant mortality was high because of the undernourishment of the mother before birth&quot;; that &quot;white man&#x27;s food leads to decay of native teeth&quot;; that &quot;tuberculosis has commenced. Saw several cases at Godhavn, Etah, Port Burwell, Arctic Bay&quot;; that &quot;an epidemic resembling influenza killed a considerable proportion of population at Port Burwell&quot;; and that &quot;the gravest danger faces the Eskimo in his transfer from a race-long hunter to a dependent trapper. White flour, sea-biscuits, tea and tobacco do not provide sufficient fuel to warm and nourish him.&quot; Furthermore, he discouraged the establishment of an Arctic hospital. The &quot;proposed hospital at Pangnirtung would be a waste of money, as it could be reached by only a few natives.&quot; Banting&#x27;s report contrasted starkly with the bland descriptions provided by the ship&#x27;s physician, F. H. Stringer.

== Personal life ==

Banting married twice. His first marriage was to Marion Robertson in 1924; they had one child. They divorced in 1932 and Banting married Henrietta Ball in 1937.

=== Painting ===
Banting developed an interest in painting beginning around 1921 while he was in London, Ontario. Some of his first pieces were done on the back of the cardboard in which his shirts were packed by the dry-cleaners. He became friends with the Group of Seven artists A. Y. Jackson and Lawren Harris, fellow members of the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto, sharing their love of the rugged Canadian landscape. Writing on Banting, Jackson recalls that &quot;He did not want to make a business of art and would tell [would-be purchasers] to go buy a Lismer or something else and then he would exchange it for one of his.&quot; An obituary said, &quot;A member of the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto, he was one of Canada&#x27;s most accomplished amateur painters.&quot;

In 1927, he made a sketching trip with Jackson to the St. Lawrence River in Quebec. Later that year, they travelled to RCMP outposts in the Arctic on the Canadian government supply ship &quot;Beothic&quot;. The sketches, done both in oils on birch panels and in pen and ink, were named after the places he visited: Craig Harbour, Ellesmere Island; Pond Inlet, Baylot Island; Eskimo tents at Etach; others were untitled. A collection of Banting&#x27;s paintings was acquired by and donated to the Owens Art Gallery at Mount Allison University in 1928. Jackson and Banting also made painting expeditions to Great Slave Lake, Walsh Lake (Northwest Territories), Georgian Bay, French River and the Sudbury District.

At the time of his death in 1941, Banting was one of Canada&#x27;s best-known amateur painters. Dennis Reid, the former director of Collections and Research at the Art Gallery of Ontario, views Banting&#x27;s works as very much &quot;part of the Jackson story&quot;.

=== Death ===
In February 1941, Banting died of wounds and exposure following the crash of a Lockheed L-14 Super Electra/Hudson in which he was a passenger, in Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland. After departing from Gander, Newfoundland, both of the plane&#x27;s engines failed. The navigator and co-pilot died instantly, but Banting and the pilot, Captain Joseph Mackey, survived the initial impact. According to Mackey, the sole survivor, Banting died from his injuries the next day. Banting was &quot;en route&quot; to England to conduct operational tests on the Franks flying suit developed by his colleague Wilbur Franks. 

Banting and his wife are buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto.

== Legacy ==

In 1994, Banting was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. In 2004, he was nominated as one of the top 10 &quot;Greatest Canadians&quot; by viewers of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. When the final votes were counted, Banting finished fourth behind Tommy Douglas, Terry Fox and Pierre Trudeau.

=== Namesakes ===

Banting&#x27;s namesake, the Banting Research Foundation, was created in 1925 and provides funding to support health and biomedical research in Canada.

Banting&#x27;s name is immortalized in the yearly Banting Lectures, given by an expert in diabetes, and by the creation of the Banting and Best Department of Medical Research of the University of Toronto; Sir Frederick G Banting Research Centre located on Sir Frederick Banting Driveway in the Tunney&#x27;s Pasture complex, Ottawa, ON; Banting Memorial High School in Alliston, ON; Sir Frederick Banting Secondary School in London, ON; Sir Frederick Banting Alternative Program Site in Ottawa, ON; Frederick Banting Elementary School in Montréal-Nord QC and École Banting Middle School in Coquitlam, BC.

The &quot;Major Sir Frederick Banting, MC, RCAMC Award for Military Health Research&quot;, sponsored by the True Patriot Love Foundation, is awarded annually by the Surgeon General to the researcher whose work presented at the annual Military and Veterans Health Research Forum is deemed to contribute most to military health. It was first awarded in 2011 in the presence of several Banting descendants.

The &quot;Canadian Forces Major Sir Frederick Banting Term Chair in Military Trauma Research&quot; at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre was established in 2012. The first Chair holder is Colonel Homer Tien, medical director of Sunnybrook&#x27;s Tory Regional Trauma Centre and Senior Specialist and Trauma Adviser to the Surgeon General.

The Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship Program is administered by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The fellowship provided up to two years of funding at $70,000 per year to researchers in health, natural sciences, engineering, social sciences and humanities.
=== Properties ===

Banting House, his former home located in London, Ontario, was declared a National Historic Site of Canada in 1997. The house contains a museum of the history of insulin, as well has Banting&#x27;s artwork. The Banting Interpretation Centre in Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland and Labrador is a museum named after him which focuses on the circumstances surrounding the 1941 plane crash which claimed his life. The crater Banting on the Moon is also named after him for his contributions to medicine.

During the voting for &quot;Greatest Canadians&quot; in late 2003, controversy rose over the future use of the Banting family farm in New Tecumseth which had been left to the Ontario Historical Society by Banting&#x27;s late nephew, Edward, in 1998. The dispute centred on the future use of the property and its buildings. In a year-long negotiation, assisted by a provincially appointed facilitator, the Town of New Tecumseth offered $1 million to the Ontario Historical Society (OHS). The town intended to turn the property over to the Sir Frederick Banting Legacy Foundation for preservation of the property and buildings, and the Legacy Foundation planned to erect a Camp for Diabetic Youths. The day after the November 22, 2006, deadline for the OHS to sign the agreement, the OHS announced that it had sold the property for housing development to Solmar Development for more than $2 million.

The Town of New Tecumseth announced it would designate the property under the Ontario Heritage Act. This would prevent its commercial development and obligate the owner to maintain it properly. OHS objected. The Ontario Conservation Review Board heard arguments for and against designation in September 2007 and recommended designation of the entire property in October. The Town officially passed the designation by-law on November 12, 2007.

Banting&#x27;s artwork has gained attention in the art community; A painting of his called &quot;St. Tîte des Cap&quot; sold for Can$30,000 including buyer&#x27;s premium at a Canadian art auction in Toronto.

=== Portrayals in film ===

He and his insulin discovery have also been depicted in various media formats, including comic books, the biography by Michael Bliss, and on television. The National Film Board of Canada produced a short film in 1958, &quot;The Quest&quot;. The 1988 television movie &quot;Glory Enough for All&quot; depicted the search for insulin by Banting and Best, with R. H. Thomson starring as Banting. Banting is also portrayed by Jason Priestley boarding his fatal flight in the 2006 historical drama &quot;Above and Beyond&quot;.

In 1923, the Canadian Parliament granted him a Life Annuity of $7,500. Following the Banting&#x27;s receipt of the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1927, Banting gave the 1928 Cameron Lecture in Edinburgh. He was a member of numerous medical academies and societies in Canada and abroad, including the British and American Physiological Societies, and the American Pharmacological Society. In 1934, he was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) by King George V and became an active vice-president of the Diabetic Association (now Diabetes UK). In May 1935 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 2004, Banting was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

=== Flame of Hope ===
A &quot;Flame of Hope&quot; was lit by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1989 as a tribute to Dr. Frederick Grant Banting and all the people that have lost their lives to diabetes. The flame will remain lit until there is a cure for diabetes. When a cure is found, the flame will be extinguished by the researchers who discover the cure. The flame is located at Sir Frederick Banting Square in London, Ontario, Canada beside the Banting House National Historic Site of Canada.

=== Time capsule ===
A time capsule was buried in the Sir Frederick Banting Square in 1991 to honour the 100th anniversary of Sir Frederick Banting&#x27;s birth. It was buried by the International Diabetes Federation youth representatives and Governor General of Canada Ray Hnatyshyn. It will be exhumed if a cure for diabetes is found.

<text>Charles Herbert Best (February 27, 1899 – March 31, 1978), was an American-Canadian medical scientist and one of the co-discoverers of insulin with Frederick Banting. He served as the chair of the Banting and Best Department of Medical Research at the University of Toronto and was further involved in research concerning choline and heparin. 

==Early life==
Charles Herbert Best was born in Pembroke, Maine, on February 27, 1899, to Luella (Lulu) Fisher and Herbert Huestis Best, a Canadian-born physician from Nova Scotia. His father, Herbert Best, was a doctor in a small Maine town with a limited economy based mostly on sardine-packing. His mother Lulu was a soprano singer, organist, and pianist. Charles Best grew up in Pembroke before going to Toronto, Ontario, to study medicine in 1915.

By the time Best had reached college age and was choosing between such schools as McGill University and the University of Toronto, family connections persuaded him to pursue his studies in Toronto. Family illness had guided Best&#x27;s research interests—his Aunt Anna dying of diabetes had profound effects on him. It was for this reason, and the fact that his father was a physician, that he chose to study at University of Toronto and train to become a doctor. His university studies were interrupted following his first year by the onset of the First World War. He served as an infantry soldier, reaching the rank of acting Sergeant Major. Following his service, he eventually returned to university in Toronto, but was falling behind in his classes.

==Co-discovery of insulin==
Best moved in 1915 to Toronto, Ontario, where he started studying towards a bachelor of arts degree at University College, University of Toronto. In 1918, he enlisted in the Canadian Army serving with the 2nd Canadian Tank Battalion. After the war, he completed his degree in physiology and biochemistry.

As a 22-year-old medical student at the University of Toronto he worked as an assistant to the surgeon Dr. Frederick Banting and contributed to the discovery of the pancreatic hormone insulin, which led to an effective treatment for diabetes. In the spring of 1921, Banting travelled to Toronto to visit John Macleod, professor of physiology at the University of Toronto, and asked Macleod if he could use his laboratory to isolate pancreatic extracts from dogs. Macleod was initially sceptical, but eventually agreed before leaving on holiday for the summer. Before leaving for Scotland he supplied Banting with ten dogs for experiment and two medical students, Charles Best and Edward Clark Noble, as lab assistants.

It was reported that Best and Noble flipped a coin to see who would assist Banting during the first period of four weeks. According to Best, however, this was the product of a journalist’s imagination, or &quot;newspaper fiction&quot;. Nonetheless, Frederick Banting is known to have mentioned this story when discussing the discovery of insulin.MacLeod was overseeing the work of Banting, who had no experience in physiology, and his assistant Best. In December 1921, when Banting and Best were having difficulties in refining the pancreatic extract and monitoring glucose levels, MacLeod assigned the biochemist James Collip to the team. In January 1922, while Collip was working on insulin purification, Best and Banting administered prematurely their pancreatic extracts to 14-year-old Leonard Thompson, who suffered a severe allergic reaction. Eventually, Collip succeeded in preparing insulin in a more pure, usable form. Banting, Best and Collip shared the patent for insulin, which they sold to the University of Toronto for one dollar.

In 1923, the Nobel Prize Committee honoured Banting and John Macleod with the Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of insulin, ignoring Best and Collip. Banting chose to share half of the prize money with Best. The key contribution by Collip was recognised in the Nobel speech of MacLeod, who also gave one-half of his prize money to Collip. However, &quot;if Banting was hoping that this might offer Best some consolation for not having shared in the prize, he was mistaken. Best’s resentment at having been overlooked began to irritate Banting&quot;, to the point that Banting stated in 1941 &quot;If I don’t come back and they give my [Professorial] Chair to that son-of-a-bitch Best, I’ll never rest in my grave&quot;, shortly before Banting boarded a plane for the UK which crashed and killed him. After Banting&#x27;s death, Best &quot;claimed that the crucial innovation of using alcohol to remove toxic impurities had largely been his own&quot;, even though this had actually been Collip&#x27;s key contribution. In 1972, an official history of the Nobel Committee declared that omitting Best might have been a mistake. In fact, Best was not considered because he was never nominated. Nomination for a Nobel Prize can only be made by certain individuals, including former recipients of the Prize, and his central role along with Banting was not known to those who had the ability to make nominations. Best was subsequently nominated for the 1950 Nobel Prize in physiology based on his work on choline and heparin.

Best succeeded Macleod as professor of physiology at University of Toronto in 1929. During World War II he was influential in establishing a Canadian program for securing and using dried human blood serum. In his later years, he was an adviser to the Medical Research Committee of the United Nations World Health Organization

== Personal life ==
Best later claimed that the greatest moment of his life occurred when he met his future wife, Margaret Mahon (1900–1988) following his return. Best married Margaret Hooper Mahon in Toronto in 1924 and they had two sons. One son, Henry Best was a well-regarded historian who later became president of Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. Best&#x27;s other son was Charles Alexander Best, a Canadian politician and geneticist. Best is the grandfather of Susan MacTavish Best.

Best died on March 31, 1978, in Toronto. He is interred in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto, not far from Sir Frederick Banting.

==Awards and honours==

Best was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946. He was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948. He was elected to both the American Philosophical Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1950. In 1967 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in recognition for &quot;his contribution to medicine, particularly as co-discoverer of insulin.&quot; He was a commander of the Civil Division of the Order of the British Empire and was made a member of Order of the Companions of Honour in 1971 &quot;for services to Medical Research&quot;. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of London, the Royal Society of Canada, and was the first Canadian to be elected into the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.

As a recipient of the Order of Canada, he was awarded the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977.

In 1994 he was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. In 2004, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

Dr. Charles Best Secondary School in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Dr. Charles Best Public School in Burlington, Ontario, and Charles H. Best Middle School in Toronto, Ontario, are named in his honour. His birthplace in Maine is listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="75079" wikidata="Q7892568" url="?curid=75079" title="United States military aircraft designation systems">
<text>Multiple designation systems have been used to specify United States military aircraft. The first system was introduced in 1911 by the United States Navy, but was discontinued six years later; the first system similar to that used today was designed in 1919 when the US Army&#x27;s Aeronautical Division became the United States Army Air Service. Before this, aircraft were put into service under their manufacturers&#x27; designations.

==History==
=== United States Army Air Service system 1919–1924 ===

During this period, type designations used by the United States Army Air Service consisted of a two or three letter abbreviation of the aircraft&#x27;s purpose. Examples include GA for Ground Attack aircraft, NO for Night Observation aircraft, and NBS for Night Bombardment, Short Distance aircraft.

=== Army aviation system 1924–1962 ===

From 1924 to 1947 the Air Service, United States Army Air Corps, United States Army Air Forces and United States Air Force used a designation system based on mission category, with each model in a category numbered sequentially. In 1947 when the Air Force became a separate service, the designation system was extensively overhauled, with several categories being discontinued and others renamed. For instance, the Lockheed P-80 &quot;Shooting Star&quot; (Pursuit) was redesignated as F-80 (Fighter), while the A-26 medium bomber/attack aircraft was redesignated as the B-26, reusing the designation, the Martin B-26 having retired in the meantime.

=== US Navy systems pre-1962 ===
Before 1962, the United States Navy, which also procured aircraft for the United States Marine Corps and United States Coast Guard, used several designation systems. The first was adopted in 1911, but it was replaced by the second in 1914, and aircraft still in inventory were redesignated. Both systems were based primarily on aircraft class rather than mission. In 1917, the 1914 system was dropped, and the Navy reverted to using manufacturer&#x27;s model designations. In 1922, a new designation system was adopted based on both &quot;mission&quot; and &quot;manufacturer&quot;, and lasted until 1962. 

====Airships====

Navy blimps were initially grouped by class and then used a special designation system until 1954, when this system was unified with the main 1922 system. In contrast with its other aircraft, the Navy&#x27;s four rigid airships were treated as commissioned warships, and were given hull classification symbols.

=== United States Army system 1956–1962 ===
From 1956 to 1962 the United States Army used a separate designation system from that of the United States Air Force.

=== Tri-service aircraft system (Air Force/Army/Navy) 1962–present ===
Starting 18 September 1962, a joint system of &quot;mission&quot;-based designations was used, with most of these restarting from 1. Various previously-designated models from the pre-1962 Army-Air Force system (such as the F-111) were not redesignated. 
All in-use Navy and Marine Corps aircraft from the pre-1962 system were redesignated within the new system. An attempt was made to retain the original Type Sequence numbers for as many aircraft as possible. Thus, the F2H Banshee became the F-2, the F4H Phantom II became the F-4 and the F8U Crusader became the F-8. Army aircraft from the 1956 system were similarly redesignated. 

The 1962 Tri-Service aircraft designation system is still in use today, though, since 1974, it has been presented and maintained alongside the 1963 Tri-Service rocket and guided missile designation system. DoD Directive 4120.15, first issued in 1971 and most recently updated in 2020 (4120.15E incorporating Change 02 &quot;Designating and Naming Military Aerospace Vehicles&quot;) is implemented via Air Force Instruction 16-401/Army Regulation 70-50/Naval Air Systems Command Instruction (NAVAIRINST) 13100.16 (3 November 2020) and describes both systems. A list of US military aircraft was kept via 4120.15-L Model Designation of Military Aerospace Vehicles 31 August 2018 until its transition to data.af.mil on 31 August 2018.

<text>Pre-revolutionary Imperial Russia (before 1917) did not have a single national unified system but instead relied on those provided by the manufacturers of the aircraft, like Sikorsky Ilya Muromets or Anatra Anasal.

==Pre-war Soviet system==
The Soviet system used from shortly after the revolution in 1923 and until gradually superseded after 1940, was divided by function, with numbers assigned in order by the government. Duplicate designations were common, as were multiple meanings for individual letters. Designers and manufacturers also had their own internal designations which could be confused for the official government designations. For instance, Tupolev&#x27;s designs used the designator ANT, for A.N.Tupolev and Yakovlev&#x27;s designs used AIR, for A.I.Rykov, the communist leader he reported to. Not all designations were taken up, some numbers were assigned to projects that were subsequently cancelled, often at a very early stage of development.

==Soviet system after December 9, 1940==
The system after December 9, 1940 (in accordance with order No 704) used letter abbreviations for the &quot;design office&quot;, 
then sequential numbers, sometimes with odd numbers for &quot;fighters&quot; (e.g. Yak-3, MiG-15, Su-27...) and even numbers for other types (e.g. Il-2, Tu-16, Su-34, Tu-154...). However, this latter rule was not always applied, especially for helicopters.

Contrary to western sources, official Soviet designations did not include constructors&#x27; names (e.g. Yakovlev Yak-1), only abbreviations (i.e. Yak-1) however initially full names like Yakovlev-1 were occasionally used. Numerical designations were assigned individually for each developer to aircraft when they entered service. Aircraft also frequently had development designations used within design bureaus, like aircraft 105, or ANT-105 that led to the Tu-22, or T-6 for Su-24, and an industry production name assigned to the facility where production was undertaken.

The NATO Air Standardization Coordinating Committee reporting name system (used because designations of new types were often unknown to NATO) was based on an initial letter indicating type of aircraft (B = bomber, C = cargo, F = fighter, H = helicopter, M = miscellaneous) or missile, and 1 syllable if propeller-driven or 2 if jet- or rocket-powered.

<text>This list of the military aircraft of the Soviet Union and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) includes experimental, prototypes, and operational types regardless of era. It also includes both native Soviet designs, Soviet-produced copies of foreign designs, and foreign-produced aircraft that served in the military of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and its successor states of the CIS. The service time frame begins with the year the aircraft entered military service (not the date of first flight, as reported by some sources). Stated production quantities, which are often very approximate, include all variants of the aircraft type produced for the USSR, unless otherwise noted.

Wikipedia convention is to use the Soviet or Russian names and designations for these aircraft, not the post-World War II NATO reporting names, although these will be used as redirects to guide the reader to the desired article. The reporting names assigned by Western intelligence agencies listed here are provided for ease of reference; they are by no means complete.

<text>British military aircraft designations are used to refer to aircraft types and variants operated by the armed forces of the United Kingdom.

Since the end of the First World War, aircraft types in British military service have generally been known by a service name (e.g. &#x27;Spitfire&#x27;), with individual variants recognised by mark numbers, often in combination with a letter to indicate the role. This is in contrast to identification systems used in countries such as the United States, where an aircraft type is primarily identified by an alphanumeric designation.

The British military aircraft designations (e.g. &#x27;Spitfire Mark V&#x27; or &#x27;Hercules C3&#x27;) should not be confused with the military aircraft registration (also known as its &quot;serial&quot;) used to identify individual aircraft (e.g. XR220), nor with U.S. aircraft designations (e.g. C-5, C-17, MQ-9) or manufacturer&#x27;s designations (e.g. Sikorsky S-58, Jaguar B, WS-61, AW139, WAH-64), though mark numbers were used to indicate aircraft built for other nations e.g. Hawker Hunter Mk.58 was a Hunter F.6 for the Swiss Air Force.

No designation system was introduced during World War I that covered more than the products of a single manufacturer. The Admiralty frequently referred to designs by the serial of the first aircraft of that type to be accepted for service.

==The military designation system==
In this system, which has been used since the end of World War I, each aircraft designation consists of a name, (sometimes) a role prefix, and a mark number.

A unified official naming system was introduced in February 1918 by the Ministry of Munitions, the scheme would use classes of names related to the role. Fighter aircraft were to be animals, plants or minerals; bomber aircraft were to have geographical names; and &#x27;heavy armoured machines&#x27; would be personal names from mythology. The classes were further divided by size of aircraft and land or sea-based, for example a three-seater sea-based fighter would be named after shellfish. Italian towns were to be used for single-seat land-based bombers.

Following the formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1918, the Ministry of Munitions introduced a new system as &quot;Technical Department Instruction 538&quot;. They mainly followed the February 1918 scheme, but certain names already used for engines were excluded, for example birds of prey were used by Rolls-Royce for their aero-engines. The names related to zoology, geography, and mythology were withdrawn in 1927, and the Air Ministry introduced names with the initial letters relating to role, for example C for troop carriers as used by the Handley Page Clive. A further change was made in 1932 and 1939, to use more appropriate names. Fighters were to use &quot;General words indicating speed, activity or aggressiveness&quot;, and trainer aircraft would be &quot;words indicating tuition and places of education&quot;.

Bombers were to be named after inland towns in the British Empire, for example the Avro Lancaster and Fairey Battle (after Battle, East Sussex, the site of the Battle of Hastings). With the introduction of helicopters, these were to be named after trees but only the Bristol Sycamore was named in this scheme.

===Names===
The name (&#x27;type name&#x27;) of an aircraft type would be agreed between the Air Ministry or Admiralty and the manufacturer or importer when the order was placed. Names generally followed one or a number of patterns:
*Alliteration was particularly common; e.g. aircraft from Vickers-Armstrongs were given names starting with V, Hawker Aircraft, names starting with H, etc. This began during the First World War, when aircraft manufacturers were given an initial pairing of letters to use in the naming of their aircraft: e.g. Boulton Paul Ltd were given &#x27;Bo&#x27;. From this, and the requirement to use the names of birds or insects for fighter aircraft, their first in-house fighter design was the Boulton Paul Bobolink. For bombers the additional requirement was a place-name, hence the Boulton Paul Bourges; and its contemporaries; the Airco DH.10 Amiens and Vickers Vimy (Bourges, Amiens and Vimy all being in France).
*Heavy bombers received the names of cities and towns: Short Stirling, Avro Lancaster, and Handley Page Halifax. Likewise transport aircraft also received the names of cities and towns: Avro York, Vickers Valetta, Handley Page Hastings, and Blackburn Beverley.
*Flying boats were given the names of coastal or port communities: Saro London, Supermarine Stranraer, and Short Sunderland.
*Land-based maritime patrol aircraft were named for naval explorers: Avro Anson (Admiral George Anson), Lockheed Hudson (Henry Hudson), Avro Shackleton (Ernest Shackleton), and Bristol Beaufort (Francis Beaufort).
*Aircraft for army co-operation and liaison and gliders were given names associated with mythological or legendary leaders; e.g.: Westland Lysander, Airspeed Horsa, General Aircraft Hamilcar, and Slingsby Hengist. A sense of irony was present when some of the names were chosen as Hengist and Horsa were the mythical leaders and founders of England when the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes invaded the British Isles in the 5th century.
*American aircraft, whether purchased directly or sourced under Lend-Lease, were given American-themed names following established patterns, e.g.: the Martin Baltimore and Consolidated Catalina. The American services, with the exception of the U.S. Navy, were not generally in the habit of giving aircraft names, and many British-chosen names would later be adopted; e.g.: the North American P-51 Mustang began life as the North American Mustang Mk.I with the Royal Air Force. U.S. Navy names, conversely, were being increasingly adopted by the Fleet Air Arm as 1942 and 1943 progressed, as in the case of the Grumman F4F Wildcat shedding its alternative Fleet Air Arm &#x27;Martlet&#x27; name in favour of &#x27;Wildcat&#x27;, the original American naval name.
*Naval versions of aircraft not originally ordered for the Fleet Air Arm were given the prefix &#x27;Sea&#x27;, such as with the Hawker Sea Hurricane and de Havilland Sea Venom, while Seafire for the navalised Supermarine Spitfire was a contraction of &#x27;Sea Spitfire&#x27;. Sometimes, the naval version entered service without a corresponding land-based type doing so, as with the Hawker Sea Fury and de Havilland Sea Vixen.
*Naval aircraft ordered as such had names with a nautical theme; e.g.: Supermarine Walrus, Blackburn Roc, and Fairey Gannet. Torpedo bombers were given &#x27;fish&#x27; names; e.g.: Blackburn Shark, Fairey Swordfish, and Fairey Barracuda. Mythological names, particularly with an association with water were common, such as Blackburn Iris, named for the goddess of sea and sky, and Nimrod the mighty hunter, used for the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod and Hawker Nimrod (a 1930s carrier fighter). Nimrod aside, many naval fighters were named for birds; such as the Fairey Flycatcher, Fairey Fulmar, Blackburn Skua and, before the aforementioned adoption of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s existing names for Fleet Air Arm aircraft of American origin, Grumman Martlet (the martlet being a heraldic bird) for the F4F fighter.
*Training aircraft were given names related to academic institutions: Airspeed Oxford, North American Harvard, Boulton Paul Balliol, and Fairchild Cornell. As with other American aircraft purchased, appropriate US names were used; the Harvard and Cornell universities. Alternative names for teachers were also used; De Havilland Dominie, Percival Provost, Miles Magister, and Percival Proctor.
*Aircraft built for one role, such as the Avro Anson or Armstrong Whitworth Albemarle, but converted to other roles, rarely changed their names. However significant changes in a design might result in a name change; the extensive redesign of the Avro Manchester from two engines to four was renamed Avro Lancaster, which was in turn renamed Avro Lincoln (initially Lancaster Mark.IV) as the design was improved, however the Lincoln had more in common with the Manchester than the late models of Spitfire did with the early versions so it wasn&#x27;t consistent.
*A trend might also be followed by a manufacturer; Hawker Hurricane, Typhoon, Tornado, and Tempest.
*Where civilian aircraft types have been taken into service, their existing names or alphanumeric designations have often (though not always) been retained; e.g.: the Vickers VC10 or Lockheed TriStar.

The systems began to change in the immediate post-Second World War period, with the V bombers and types such as the Supermarine Scimitar. The RAF&#x27;s three post-war jet-engined, swept wing strategic bombers were given names beginning with &#x27;V&#x27; – Vickers Valiant, Avro Vulcan, and Handley Page Victor (the V bombers).

===Role prefixes===
Role prefixes used at various times comprise:
===Mark numbers===
Starting in the interwar period, variants of each operational type were usually indicated by a mark number, a Roman numeral added to the type name, usually preceded by &#x27;Mark&#x27;, or its abbreviated form &#x27;Mk.&#x27; or &#x27;Mk&#x27;, e.g.: Fury Mk.I. Mark numbers were allocated sequentially to each new variant, the new mark number signifying a &#x27;major&#x27; change such as a new engine-type. Sometimes, an alphabetic suffix was added to the mark number to indicate a minor change, e.g.: Bulldog Mk.IIA. Occasionally, this letter indicated a change in role, e.g.: the Blenheim Mk.I bomber was adapted to the Blenheim Mk.IF long-range fighter. Sometimes a minor but otherwise significant change in an aircraft would necessitate a new mark number, e.g., when the Lancaster I was fitted with Packard-built Merlin engines, which used a different make of carburettor from the Rolls-Royce-built ones, the Lancaster I became a Lancaster III. Otherwise, these two aircraft were identical in appearance and performance, and normally indistinguishable from each other but needed to be identified differently for maintenance.

During the Second World War, as aircraft ordered for one purpose became adapted to a multitude of roles, mark numbers became prefixed with letters to indicate the role of that variant. Aircraft of the same mark that were adapted for different purpose would then be differentiated by the prefix. For instance the Defiant Mk.I was adapted to a night fighter, the Defiant NF Mk.II, some of which were later converted to target tugs as the Defiant TT Mk.II. Where there was a &quot;Sea-&quot; variant, this would have its own series of mark numbers, e.g.: the Seafire Mk.I was derived from the Spitfire Mk.V.

Occasionally, other &#x27;minor&#x27; but nonetheless important changes might be denoted by series numbers, preceded by &#x27;Series&#x27;, &#x27;Srs.&#x27;, or &#x27;Srs&#x27;, e.g.: Mosquito B Mk.IV Series I / B Mk.IV Series II – the different series number denoting the introduction, after a few initial production aircraft, of extended engine nacelles to eliminate buffeting. This design change was made standard on all subsequent production Mosquitoes. The series number denoted a revision during the production run of a particular mark. This again could then have an additional letter-suffix; e.g.: the Halifax Mk.II Series IA.

Export variants of British military aircraft are usually allocated mark numbers (sometimes without a role prefix) from a higher range of numbers, usually starting at Mark 50. A converse convention was adopted for the Canadian-designed de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk, where the sole British service variant was designated Chipmunk T.10.

Up until the end of 1942, the RAF always used Roman numerals for mark numbers, sometimes separated from its &#x27;mark&#x27; abbreviation by a period (full stop). 1943 to 1948 was a transition period, during which new aircraft entering service were given Arabic numerals for mark numbers, but older aircraft retained their Roman numerals. From 1948 onwards, Arabic numerals were used exclusively. Thus, the Spitfire PR Mk.XIX became the PR Mk.19 after 1948. With this change, the &quot;Sea-&quot; variants were allocated their own range within one common series for all variants; e.g.: the Hawker Fury Mk.I was followed by the Sea Fury F.10, Sea Fury FB.11 etc.

More recently, mark numbers have not always been used sequentially, but instead used to highlight differences in equipment installed. Specific examples include aerial refuelling tankers; the RAF Voyager is either designated as KC2, indicating two Cobham 905E underwing hose and drogue refuelling pods, whereas the KC3 indicates a total of three hose and drogue refuelling units (two underwing, and an additional centreline Cobham 805E Fuselage Refuelling Unit), there was never any &#x27;mark 1&#x27; variant of the Voyager.

===Format of designation===
The system has been largely unchanged since 1948, with the addition of more prefixes as new roles have arisen.

For example, the first Lockheed Hercules variant in Royal Air Force service was the Hercules C.1 (&#x27;Cargo, Mark 1&#x27;). A single example was adapted for weather monitoring purposes and became the Hercules W.2. The fuselage-lengthened variant became the Hercules C.3. For aircraft with a long service life, as their function evolves over time, the designation letters and sometimes the mark digit will change to reflect this. The practice of restarting the mark numbers for the naval variant where the name was changed continued; e.g., the naval version of the Hawker Siddely Harrier, the BAe Sea Harrier, marks started again at FRS Mk.1, whilst variants where the name was unchanged for the naval version such as the Lynx have a single set of numbers for both land and naval variants. In the case of the Sea King, which began as a naval aircraft, the RAF kept the name and it also has a single set of numbers.

The post-1948 mark numbers are variously presented in full, e.g.: Hercules C Mk.3; or abbreviated, e.g.: Hercules C3 forms; and either with or without a full stop between the prefix and mark number. The use of the &#x27;Mark&#x27; or &#x27;Mk.&#x27; has gradually been dropped.

==Other designation systems used for UK military aircraft==
===Specification numbers===

From 1920 to 1949, most aircraft had an associated Air Ministry specification number. Prototype aircraft would be produced under contract, and would be referred to by manufacturer name and specification number. If accepted, they would get a service name. For example, the &#x27;Fairey 6/22&#x27; was built to meet the 6th specification issued in the year 1922; it was subsequently accepted as the Fairey Flycatcher. Later, a preceding letter was added to the specification number to identify the type of aircraft; e.g.: specification B.28/35 for a bomber was the 28th specification issued in 1935; in this case the specification was specifically written for the Bristol 142M, a modification of Bristol&#x27;s Type 142 private venture civil aircraft (&quot;Britain First&quot;) for military use as a bomber, which would enter service as the Bristol Blenheim Mk.I light bomber.

===Manufacturers designations===
From about 1910, the largest single designer of aircraft for the British Army&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the Royal Aircraft Factory. The Royal Aircraft Factory designated its types according to either the layout of the aircraft or its role; e.g.: Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5, the &#x27;S.E.&#x27; prefix representing &#x27;scouting experimental&#x27;. In practice, successful Royal Aircraft Factory designs were largely built by other manufacturers, though still known by the Royal Aircraft Factory designations.

Some examples of manufacturers designations and the corresponding service designations are shown below:
*Avro 549A = Aldershot II;
*Vickers VC10 Type 1180, the tenth &#x27;Vickers Civil&#x27; design, were (Type 1106) VC10 C1 transports converted to have additional tanker role; known in service as Vickers VC10 C1K;
*Westland WAH-64 Apache = Apache AH1.

===US designations===
For some aircraft types in the UK armed services which originate from established U.S. military aircraft; e.g., the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, which is currently known in RAF service as the &#x27;C-17 Globemaster III&#x27;, have used the original US designation, rather than assigning a UK specific designation.

<doc id="75087" wikidata="Q466696" url="?curid=75087" title="Berenice (daughter of Herod Agrippa)">
<text>Berenice of Cilicia, also known as Julia Berenice and sometimes spelled Bernice (, &quot;Bereníkē&quot; or &quot;Berníkē&quot;; 28 – after 81), was a Jewish client queen of the Roman Empire during the second half of the 1st century. Berenice was a member of the Herodian Dynasty that ruled the Roman province of Judaea between 39 BC and 92 AD. She was the daughter of King Herod Agrippa I and Cypros and a sister of King Herod Agrippa II.

What little is known about her life and background comes mostly from the early historian Flavius Josephus, who detailed a history of the Jewish people and wrote an account of the Jewish Rebellion of 67. Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, Aurelius Victor, and Juvenal also write about her. She is also mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles (25:13, 23; 26:30). However, it is for her tumultuous love life that she is primarily known since the Renaissance. Her reputation was based on the bias of the Romans against Eastern princesses like Cleopatra, or later Zenobia. After two marriages in which she was widowed in her 40s, she spent much of the remainder of her life at the court of Herod Agrippa II, amidst rumors the two were carrying on an incestuous relationship, though this was neither proved nor disproved. During the First Jewish-Roman War, she began a love affair with the future emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus. However, her unpopularity among the Romans compelled Titus to dismiss her on his accession as emperor in 79. When he died two years later, she disappeared from the historical record.

== Early life ==

Berenice was born in 28 to Herod Agrippa and Cypros, as granddaughter to Aristobulus IV and great-granddaughter to Herod the Great. Her elder brother was Agrippa II (b. 27), and her younger sisters were Mariamne (b. 34) and Drusilla (b. 38). According to Josephus, there was also a younger brother called Drusus, who died before his teens. Her family constituted part of what is known as the Herodian Dynasty, who ruled the Judaea Province between 39 BC and 92 AD.

Josephus records three short-lived marriages in Berenice&#x27;s life, the first which took place sometime between 41 and 43, when she was between the ages of 13 and 15, to Marcus Julius Alexander, brother of Tiberius Julius Alexander and son of Alexander the Alabarch of Alexandria. On his early death in 44, she was married to her father&#x27;s brother, Herod of Chalcis, with whom she had two sons, Berenicianus and Hyrcanus. After her husband died in 48, she lived with her brother Agrippa for several years and then married Polemon II of Pontus, king of Cilicia, whom she subsequently deserted. According to Josephus, Berenice requested this marriage to dispel rumors that she and her brother were carrying on an incestuous relationship, with Polemon being persuaded to this union mostly on account of her wealth. However the marriage did not last, and she soon returned to the court of her brother. Josephus was not the only ancient writer to suggest incestuous relations between Berenice and Agrippa. Juvenal, in his sixth satire, outright claims that they were lovers. Whether this was based on truth remains unknown. Berenice indeed spent much of her life at the court of Agrippa and by all accounts shared almost equal power. Popular rumors may also have been fueled by the fact that Agrippa never married.

Like her brother, Berenice was a client ruler of the parts of the Roman Empire that lie in the present-day Israel. The Acts of the Apostles records that during this time, Paul the Apostle appeared before their court at Caesarea.

== During Jewish-Roman wars ==

=== Early phase of the revolt ===
In 64 emperor Nero appointed Gessius Florus as procurator of the Judaea Province. During his administration, the Jews were systematically discriminated against in favour of the Greek population of the region. Tensions quickly rose to civil unrest when Florus plundered the treasury of the Temple of Jerusalem under the guise of imperial taxes. Following riots, the instigators were arrested and crucified by the Romans. Appalled at the treatment of her countrymen, Berenice travelled to Jerusalem in 66 to personally petition Florus to spare the Jews. Not only did he refuse to comply with her requests, Berenice was nearly killed during skirmishes in the city. Likewise a plea for assistance to the legate of Syria, Cestius Gallus, met with no response.

To prevent violence from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a speech to the crowd in the company of his sister, but the insurgents burned down their palaces. They fled the city to Galilee where they later gave themselves up to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the Twelfth legion but was unable to restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.

=== Affair with Titus===
Emperor Nero then appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion; he landed in Judaea with the Fifth and Tenth legions in 67. He was later joined at Ptolemais by his son Titus, who brought with him the Fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across Galilee and by 69 marched on Jerusalem.

It was during this time that Berenice met and fell in love with Titus, who was eleven years her junior. The Herodians sided with the Flavians during the conflict, and later in 69, the Year of the Four Emperors—when the Roman Empire saw the quick succession of the emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius—Berenice reportedly used all her wealth and influence to support Vespasian in his campaign to become emperor. When Vespasian was declared emperor on 21 December 69, Titus was left in Judaea to finish putting down the rebellion. The war ended in 70 with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sack of Jerusalem, with hundreds of thousands killed and 97,000 taken captive by the Romans. Triumphant, Titus returned to Rome to assist his father in the government, while Berenice stayed behind in Judaea.

==In Rome==
It took four years until Titus and Berenice reunited, when she and her brother Agrippa II came to Rome in 75. The reasons for this long absence are unclear but have been linked to possible opposition to her presence by Gaius Licinius Mucianus, a political ally of emperor Vespasian who died sometime between 72 and 78. Agrippa II was given the rank of praetor, while Berenice resumed her relationship with Titus, living with him at the palace and reportedly acting in every respect as his wife. The ancient historian Cassius Dio writes that Berenice was at the height of her power during this time, and if it can be any indication as to how influential she was, Quintilian records an anecdote in his &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; where, to his astonishment, he found himself pleading a case on Berenice&#x27;s behalf where she presided as the judge. The Roman populace however perceived the Eastern queen as an intrusive outsider, and when the pair was publicly denounced by Cynics in the theatre, Titus caved to the pressure and sent her away.

Upon the accession of Titus as emperor in 79, she returned to Rome but was quickly dismissed amidst a number of popular measures of Titus to restore his reputation with the populace. It is possible that he intended to send for her at a more convenient time. However, after reigning barely two years as emperor, he suddenly died on 13 September 81. It is not known what happened to Berenice after her final dismissal from Rome. Agrippa II died around 92, and with him the Herodian Dynasty rule over Judaea came to an end.

<doc id="75088" wikidata="Q46768" url="?curid=75088" title="Maximian">
<text>Maximian (; ), nicknamed Herculius, was Roman emperor from 286 to 305. He was &quot;Caesar&quot; from 285 to 286, then &quot;Augustus&quot; from 286 to 305. He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, Diocletian, whose political brain complemented Maximian&#x27;s military brawn. Maximian established his residence at Trier but spent most of his time on campaign. In late 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the Bagaudae. From 285 to 288, he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine frontier. Together with Diocletian, he launched a scorched earth campaign deep into Alamannic territory in 288, refortifying the frontier.

The man he appointed to police the Channel shores, Carausius, rebelled in 286, causing the secession of Britain and northwestern Gaul. Maximian failed to oust Carausius, and his invasion fleet was destroyed by storms in 289 or 290. Maximian&#x27;s subordinate Constantius campaigned against Carausius&#x27; successor, Allectus, while Maximian held the Rhine frontier. The rebel leader was ousted in 296, and Maximian moved south to combat piracy near Hispania and Berber incursions in Mauretania. When these campaigns concluded in 298, he departed for Italy, where he lived in comfort until 305. At Diocletian&#x27;s behest, Maximian abdicated on 1 May 305, gave the Augustan office to Constantius, and retired to southern Italy.

In late 306, Maximian took the title of &quot;Augustus&quot; again and aided his son, Maxentius, and his rebellion in Italy. In April 307, he attempted to depose his son, but failed and fled to the court of Constantius&#x27; successor, Constantine (Maximian&#x27;s step-grandson and son-in-law), in Trier. At the Council of Carnuntum in November 308, Diocletian and his successor, Galerius, forced Maximian to renounce his imperial claim again. In early 310, Maximian attempted to seize Constantine&#x27;s title while the emperor was on campaign on the Rhine. Few supported him, and he was captured by Constantine in Marseille. Maximian killed himself in mid-310 on Constantine&#x27;s orders. During Constantine&#x27;s war with Maxentius, Maximian&#x27;s image was purged from all public places. However, after Constantine ousted and killed Maxentius, Maximian&#x27;s image was rehabilitated, and he was deified.

==Early life==
Maximian was born around 250 near Sirmium (modern Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) in the province of Pannonia, into a family of shopkeepers. Beyond that, the ancient sources contain vague allusions to Illyricum as his homeland, to his Pannonian virtues, and to his harsh upbringing along the war-torn Danube frontier. Maximian joined the army, serving with Diocletian under the emperors Aurelian (r. 270–275) and Probus (r. 276–282). He probably participated in the Mesopotamian campaign of Carus in 283 and attended Diocletian&#x27;s election as emperor on 20 November 284 at Nicomedia. Maximian&#x27;s swift appointment by Diocletian as Caesar is taken by the writer Stephen Williams and historian Timothy Barnes to mean that the two men were long-term allies, that their respective roles were pre-agreed and that Maximian had probably supported Diocletian during his campaign against Carinus (r. 283–285) but there is no direct evidence for this.

With his great energy, firm aggressive character and disinclination to rebel, Maximian was an appealing candidate for imperial office. The fourth-century historian Aurelius Victor described Maximian as &quot;a colleague trustworthy in friendship, if somewhat boorish, and of great military talents&quot;. Despite his other qualities, Maximian was uneducated and preferred action to thought. The panegyric of 289, after comparing his actions to Scipio Africanus&#x27; victories over Hannibal during the Second Punic War, suggested that Maximian had never heard of them. His ambitions were purely military; he left politics to Diocletian. The Christian rhetor Lactantius suggested that Maximian shared Diocletian&#x27;s basic attitudes but was less puritanical in his tastes, and took advantage of the sensual opportunities his position as emperor offered. Lactantius charged that Maximian defiled senators&#x27; daughters and traveled with young virgins to satisfy his unending lust, though Lactantius&#x27; credibility is undermined by his general hostility towards pagans.

Maximian had two children with his Syrian wife, Eutropia: Maxentius and Fausta. There is no direct evidence in the ancient sources for their birthdates. Modern estimates of Maxentius&#x27; birth year have varied from c. 276 to 283, and most date Fausta&#x27;s birth to c. 289 or 290. Theodora, the wife of Constantius Chlorus, is often called Maximian&#x27;s stepdaughter by ancient sources, leading to claims by Otto Seeck and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia and Afranius Hannibalianus. Barnes challenges this view, saying that all &quot;stepdaughter&quot; sources derive their information from the partially unreliable work of history &quot;Kaisergeschichte&quot;, while other, more reliable, sources refer to her as Maximian&#x27;s natural daughter. Barnes concludes that Theodora was born no later than c. 275 to an unnamed earlier wife of Maximian, possibly one of Hannibalianus&#x27; daughters. Julia Hillner agrees with Barnes that the &quot;stepdaughter sources&quot; are a result of political propaganda from the later Constantinian dynasty but believes that Barnes explanation fails to explain why Theodora named one of her daughters Eutropia if her mother was an unknown Afrania instead of empress Eutropia. Hillner argues that Afranius Hannibalianus was Eutropia&#x27;s brother and that Theodora was the daughter of both Maximian and Eutropia. This is in line with John Vanderspoel.

==Appointment as Caesar==
At Mediolanum (Milan, Italy) in July 285, Diocletian appointed Maximian as his heir-apparent and subordinate, with the title &quot;Caesar&quot;. The reasons for this decision are complex. With conflict in every province of the Empire, from Gaul to Syria, from Egypt to the lower Danube, Diocletian needed a lieutenant to manage his heavy workload. Historian Stephen Williams suggests that Diocletian considered himself a mediocre general and needed a man like Maximian to do most of his fighting.
Next, Diocletian was vulnerable in that he had no sons, just a daughter, Valeria, who could never succeed him. He was forced therefore to seek a co-ruler from outside his family and that co-ruler had to be someone he trusted. The historian William Seston has argued that Diocletian, like heirless emperors before him, adopted Maximian as his &quot;filius Augusti&quot; (&quot;Augustan son&quot;) upon his appointment to the office. Some agree, but the historian Frank Kolb has stated that arguments for the adoption are based on misreadings of the papyrological evidence. Maximian did take Diocletian&#x27;s &quot;nomen&quot; (family name) Valerius, however.

Finally, Diocletian knew that single rule was dangerous and that precedent existed for dual rulership. Despite their military prowess, both sole-emperors Aurelian and Probus had been easily removed from power. In contrast, just a few years earlier, the emperor Carus and his sons had ruled jointly, albeit not for long. Even the first emperor, Augustus, (r. 27 BC–AD 14), had shared power with his colleagues and more formal offices of co-emperor had existed from Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180) on.

The dual system evidently worked well. Around 287, after Maximian&#x27;s appointment as &quot;Augustus&quot;, the two rulers&#x27; relationship was re-defined in religious terms, with Diocletian assuming the title &quot;Iovius&quot; and Maximian &quot;Herculius&quot;. The titles were pregnant with symbolism: Diocletian-Jove had the dominant role of planning and commanding; Maximian-Hercules the heroic role of completing assigned tasks. Yet despite the symbolism, the emperors were not &quot;gods&quot; in the Imperial cult (although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial panegyrics). Instead, they were the gods&#x27; instruments, imposing the gods&#x27; will on earth. Once the rituals were over, Maximian assumed control of the government of the West and was dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels known as Bagaudae while Diocletian returned to the East.

==Early campaigns in Gaul and Germany==

The Bagaudae of Gaul are obscure figures, appearing fleetingly in the ancient sources, with their 285 uprising being their first appearance. The fourth-century historian Eutropius described them as rural people under the leadership of Amandus and Aelianus, while Aurelius Victor called them bandits. The historian David S. Potter suggests that they were more than peasants, seeking either Gallic political autonomy or reinstatement of the recently deposed Carus (a native of Gallia Narbonensis, in what would become southern France): in this case, they would be defecting imperial troops, not brigands. Although poorly equipped, led and trained – and therefore a poor match for Roman legions – Diocletian certainly considered the Bagaudae sufficient threat to merit an emperor to counter them. Maximian has been implicated in a massacre of Coptic Christian troops from the headquarters unit of a legion raised in Thebes at Aucanus in modern Switzerland in early 285, during the preparations for the campaign against the Bagaudae.

Maximian traveled to Gaul, engaging the Bagaudae late in mid-285. Details of the campaign are sparse and provide no tactical detail: the historical sources dwell only on Maximian&#x27;s virtues and victories. The panegyric to Maximian in 289 records that the rebels were defeated with a blend of harshness and leniency. As the campaign was against the Empire&#x27;s own citizens, and therefore distasteful, it went unrecorded in titles and official triumphs. Indeed, Maximian&#x27;s panegyrist declares: &quot;I pass quickly over this episode, for I see in your magnanimity you would rather forget this victory than celebrate it.&quot; By the end of the year, the revolt had significantly abated, and Maximian moved the bulk of his forces to the Rhine frontier, heralding a period of stability.

Maximian did not put down the Bagaudae swiftly enough to avoid a Germanic reaction. In late 285, two barbarian armies – one of Burgundians and Alamanni, the other of Chaibones and Heruli – forded the Rhine and entered Gaul. The first army was left to die of disease and hunger, while Maximian intercepted and defeated the second. He then established a Rhine headquarters in preparation for future campaigns, either at Moguntiacum (Mainz, Germany), Augusta Treverorum (Trier, Germany), or Colonia Agrippina (Cologne, Germany).

==Carausius==

Although most of Gaul was pacified, regions bordering the English Channel still suffered from Frankish and Saxon piracy. The emperors Probus and Carinus had begun to fortify the Saxon Shore, but much remained to be done. For example, there is no archaeological evidence of naval bases at Dover and Boulogne during 270–285. In response to the pirate problem, Maximian appointed Mausaeus Carausius, a Menapian from Germania Inferior (southern and western Netherlands) to command the Channel and to clear it of raiders. Carausius fared well, and by the end of 285 he was capturing pirate ships in great numbers.

Maximian soon heard that Carausius was waiting until the pirates had finished plundering before attacking and keeping their booty himself instead of returning it to the population at large or into the imperial treasury. Maximian ordered Carausius&#x27; arrest and execution, prompting him to flee to Britain. Carausius&#x27; support among the British was strong, and at least two British legions (II Augusta and XX Valeria Victrix) defected to him, as did some or all of a legion near Boulogne (probably XXX Ulpia Victrix). Carausius quickly eliminated the few remaining loyalists in his army and declared himself Augustus.

Maximian could do little about the revolt. He had no fleet – he had given it to Carausius – and was busy quelling the Heruli and the Franks. Meanwhile, Carausius strengthened his position by enlarging his fleet, enlisting Frankish mercenaries, and paying his troops well. By late 286, Britain, much of northwestern Gaul, and the entire Channel coast, was under his control. Carausius declared himself head of an independent British state, an &quot;Imperium Britanniarum&quot; and issued coin of a markedly higher purity than that of Maximian and Diocletian, earning the support of British and Gallic merchants. Even Maximian&#x27;s troops were vulnerable to Carausius&#x27; influence and wealth.

==Maximian appointed Augustus==

Spurred by the crisis with Carausius, on 1 April 286, Maximian took the title of &quot;Augustus&quot; (emperor). This gave him the same status as Carausius – so the clash was between two &quot;Augusti&quot;, rather than between an &quot;Augustus&quot; and a &quot;Caesar&quot; – and, in Imperial propaganda, Maximian was proclaimed Diocletian&#x27;s brother, his equal in authority and prestige. Diocletian could not have been present at Maximian&#x27;s appointment, causing Seeck to suggest that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war. This suggestion has not won much support, and the historian William Leadbetter has recently refuted it. Despite the physical distance between the emperors, Diocletian trusted Maximian enough to invest him with imperial powers, and Maximian still respected Diocletian enough to act in accordance with his will.

In theory, the Roman Empire was not divided by the dual &quot;imperium&quot;. Though divisions did take place – each emperor had his own court, army, and official residences – these were matters of practicality, not substance. Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome, a &quot;patrimonium indivisum&quot;. As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian: &quot;So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you, without any discord, nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you, but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two Heracleidae, the Spartan Kings, had done.&quot; Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors&#x27; names, and the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire. Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximian&#x27;s province of Africa; Maximian could presumably have done the same for Diocletian&#x27;s territory.

==Campaigns against Rhenish tribes==

===Campaigns in 286 and 287===
Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress Carausius and campaigned instead against Rhenish tribes. These tribes were probably greater threats to Gallic peace anyway and included many supporters of Carausius. Although Maximian had many enemies along the river, they were more often in dispute with each other than in combat with the Empire. Few clear dates survive for Maximian&#x27;s campaigns on the Rhine beyond a general range of 285 to 288.
While receiving the consular &quot;fasces&quot; on 1 January 287, Maximian was interrupted by news of a barbarian raid. Doffing his toga and donning his armor, he marched against the barbarians and, although they were not entirely dispersed, he celebrated a victory in Gaul later that year.

Maximian believed the Burgundian and Alemanni tribes of the Moselle-Vosges region to be the greatest threat, so he targeted them first. He campaigned using scorched earth tactics, laying waste to their land and reducing their numbers through famine and disease. After the Burgundians and Alemanni, Maximian moved against the weaker Heruli and Chaibones. He cornered and defeated them in a single battle. He fought in person, riding along the battle line until the Germanic forces broke. Roman forces pursued the fleeing tribal armies and routed them. With his enemies weakened from starvation, Maximian launched a great invasion across the Rhine. He moved deep into Germanic territory, bringing destruction to his enemies&#x27; homelands and demonstrating the superiority of Roman arms. By the end of 287, he had the advantage and the Rhenish lands were free of Germanic tribesmen. Maximian&#x27;s panegyrist declared: &quot;All that I see beyond the Rhine is Roman.&quot;

===Joint campaign against the Alamanni===
Early the next year, as Maximian made preparations for dealing with Carausius, Diocletian returned from the East. The emperors met that year, but neither date nor place is known with certainty. They probably agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni and a naval expedition against Carausius.

Later in the year, Maximian led a surprise invasion of the Agri Decumates – a region between the upper Rhine and upper Danube deep within Alamanni territory – while Diocletian invaded Germany via Raetia. Both emperors burned crops and food supplies as they went, destroying the Germans&#x27; means of sustenance. They added large swathes of territory to the Empire and allowed Maximian&#x27;s build-up to proceed without further disturbance. In the aftermath of the war, towns along the Rhine were rebuilt, bridgeheads created on the eastern banks at such places as Mainz and Cologne, and a military frontier was established, comprising forts, roads, and fortified towns. A military highway through Tornacum (Tournai, Belgium), Bavacum (Bavay, France), Atuatuca Tungrorum (Tongeren, Belgium), Mosae Trajectum (Maastricht, Netherlands), and Cologne connected points along the frontier.

===Constantius, Gennobaudes, and resettlement===
In early 288, Maximian appointed his praetorian prefect Constantius Chlorus, husband of Maximian&#x27;s daughter Theodora, to lead a campaign against Carausius&#x27; Frankish allies. These Franks controlled the Rhine estuaries, thwarting sea-attacks against Carausius. Constantius moved north through their territory, wreaking havoc, and reaching the North Sea. The Franks sued for peace and in the subsequent settlement Maximian reinstated the deposed Frankish king Gennobaudes. Gennobaudes became Maximian&#x27;s vassal and, with lesser Frankish chiefs in turn swearing loyalty to Gennobaudes, Roman regional dominance was assured.

Maximian allowed a settlement of Frisii, Salian Franks, Chamavi and other tribes along a strip of Roman territory, either between the Rhine and Waal rivers from Noviomagus (Nijmegen, Netherlands) to Traiectum, (Utrecht, Netherlands) or near Trier. These tribes were allowed to settle on the condition that they acknowledged Roman dominance. Their presence provided a ready pool of manpower and prevented the settlement of other Frankish tribes, giving Maximian a buffer along the northern Rhine and reducing his need to garrison the region.

==Later campaigns in Britain and Gaul==

===Failed expedition against Carausius===
By 289, Maximian was prepared to invade Carausius&#x27; Britain, but for some reason the plan failed. Maximian&#x27;s panegyrist of 289 was optimistic about the campaign&#x27;s prospects, but the panegyrist of 291 made no mention of it. Constantius&#x27; panegyrist suggested that his fleet was lost to a storm, but this might simply have been to diminish the embarrassment of defeat. Diocletian curtailed his Eastern province tour soon after, perhaps on learning of Maximian&#x27;s failure. Diocletian returned in haste to the West, reaching Emesa by 10 May 290, and Sirmium on the Danube by 1 July 290.

Diocletian met Maximian in Milan either in late December 290 or January 291. Crowds gathered to witness the event, and the emperors devoted much time to public pageantry. Potter, among others, has surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian&#x27;s continuing support for his faltering colleague. The rulers discussed matters of politics and war in secret, and they may have considered the idea of expanding the imperial college to include four emperors (the Tetrarchy). Meanwhile, a deputation from the Roman Senate met with the rulers and renewed its infrequent contact with the imperial office. The emperors would not meet again until 303.

Following Maximian&#x27;s failure to invade in 289, an uneasy truce with Carausius began. Maximian tolerated Carausius&#x27; rule in Britain and on the continent but refused to grant the secessionist state formal legitimacy. For his part, Carausius was content with his territories beyond the Continental coast of Gaul. Diocletian, however, would not tolerate this affront to his rule. Faced with Carausius&#x27; secession and further challenges on the Egyptian, Syrian, and Danubian borders, he realized that two emperors were insufficient to manage the Empire. On 1 March 293 at Milan, Maximian appointed Constantius to the office of Caesar. On either the same day or a month later, Diocletian did the same for Galerius, thus establishing the &quot;Tetrarchy&quot;, or &quot;rule of four&quot;. Constantius was made to understand that he must succeed where Maximian had failed and defeat Carausius.

===Campaign against Allectus===
Constantius met expectations quickly and efficiently and by 293 had expelled Carausian forces from northern Gaul. In the same year, Carausius was assassinated and replaced by his treasurer, Allectus. Constantius marched up the coast to the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries where he was victorious over Carausius&#x27; Frankish allies, taking the title &quot;Germanicus maximus&quot;. His sights now set on Britain, Constantius spent the following years building an invasion fleet. Maximian, still in Italy after the appointment of Constantius, was apprised of the invasion plans and, in mid-296, returned to Gaul. There, he held the Rhenish frontiers against Carausius&#x27; Frankish allies while Constantius launched his invasion of Britain. Allectus was killed on the North Downs in battle with Constantius&#x27; praetorian prefect, Asclepiodotus. Constantius himself had landed near Dubris (Dover) and marched on Londinium (London), whose citizens greeted him as a liberator.

==Campaigns in North Africa==

With Constantius&#x27; victorious return, Maximian was able to focus on the conflict in Mauretania (Northwest Africa). As Roman authority weakened during the third century, nomadic Berber tribes harassed settlements in the region with increasingly severe consequences. In 289, the governor of Mauretania Caesariensis (roughly modern Algeria) gained a temporary respite by pitting a small army against the Bavares and Quinquegentiani, but the raiders soon returned. In 296, Maximian raised an army, from Praetorian cohorts, Aquileian, Egyptian, and Danubian legionaries, Gallic and German auxiliaries, and Thracian recruits, advancing through Spain later that year. He may have defended the region against raiding Moors before crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into Mauretania Tingitana (roughly modern Morocco) to protect the area from Frankish pirates.

By March 297, Maximian had begun a bloody offensive against the Berbers. The campaign was lengthy, and Maximian spent the winter of 297–298 resting in Carthage before returning to the field. Not content to drive them back into their homelands in the Atlas Mountains – from which they could continue to wage war – Maximian ventured deep into Berber territory. The terrain was unfavorable, and the Berbers were skilled at guerrilla warfare, but Maximian pressed on. Apparently wishing to inflict as much punishment as possible on the tribes, he devastated previously secure land, killed as many as he could, and drove the remainder back into the Sahara. His campaign was concluded by early 298 and, on 10 March, he made a triumphal entry into Carthage. Inscriptions there record the people&#x27;s gratitude to Maximian, hailing him – as Constantius had been on his entry to London – as &quot;redditor lucis aeternae&quot; (&quot;restorer of the eternal light&quot;). Maximian returned to Italy in early 299 to celebrate another triumph in Rome.

After his Mauretanian campaign in 299, Maximian returned to the north of Italy, living a life of leisure in palaces in Milan and Aquilea, and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius. Maximian was more aggressive in his relationship with the Senate than Constantius, and Lactantius contends that he terrorized senators, to the point of falsely charging and subsequently executing several, including the prefect of Rome in 301–2. In contrast, Constantius kept up good relations with the senatorial aristocracy and spent his time in active defense of the empire. He took up arms against the Franks in 300 or 301 and in 302 – while Maximian was resting in Italy – continued to campaign against Germanic tribes on the Upper Rhine.

According to Aurelius Victor, he also built a palace near his home town of Sirmium. In addition to the imperial palace in Sirmium another palace has been found at Glac, which may be that of Maximian.

==Retirement==
Diocletian&#x27;s &quot;vicennalia&quot;, the 20-year anniversary of his reign, was celebrated in Rome in 303. Some evidence suggests that it was then that Diocletian exacted a promise from Maximian to retire together, passing their titles as &quot;Augusti&quot; to the &quot;Caesars&quot; Constantius and Galerius. Presumably Maximian&#x27;s son Maxentius and Constantius&#x27;s son Constantine – children raised in Nicomedia together – would then become the new &quot;Caesars&quot;. While Maximian might not have wished to retire, Diocletian was still in control and there was little resistance. Before retirement, Maximian received one final moment of glory by officiating at the Secular Games in 304.

On 1 May 305, in separate ceremonies in Milan and Nicomedia, Diocletian and Maximian retired simultaneously. The succession did not go entirely to Maximian&#x27;s liking: perhaps because of Galerius&#x27; influence, Galerius&#x27; former army comrade Severus and Galerius&#x27; nephew Maximinus (both of whom had long military careers) were appointed &quot;Caesar&quot;, thus excluding Constantine and Maxentius. Maximian quickly soured to the new tetrarchy, which saw Galerius assume the dominant position Diocletian once held. Although Maximian led the ceremony that proclaimed Severus as &quot;Caesar&quot;, within two years he was sufficiently dissatisfied to support his son&#x27;s rebellion against the new regime. Diocletian retired to the expansive palace he had built in his homeland, Dalmatia near Salona on the Adriatic. Maximian retired to villas in Campania, Lucania or Sirmium, where he lived a life of ease and luxury. Although far from the political centers of the Empire, Diocletian and Maximian remained close enough to stay in regular contact.

==Maxentius&#x27; rebellion==
After the death of Constantius on 25 July 306, Constantine assumed the title of Augustus. This displeased Galerius, who instead offered Constantine the title of Caesar, which Constantine accepted. The title of &quot;Augustus&quot; then went to Severus. Maxentius was jealous of Constantine&#x27;s power, and on 28 October 306, he persuaded a cohort of imperial guardsmen to declare him &quot;Augustus&quot;. Uncomfortable with sole leadership, Maxentius sent a set of imperial robes to Maximian and saluted him as &quot;Augustus for the second time&quot;, offering him theoretic equal rule but less actual power and a lower rank.

Galerius refused to recognize Maxentius and sent Severus with an army to Rome to depose him. As many of Severus&#x27; soldiers had served under Maximian, and had taken Maxentius&#x27; bribes, most of the army defected to Maxentius. Severus fled to Ravenna, which Maximian besieged. The city was strongly fortified so Maximian offered terms, which Severus accepted. Maximian then seized Severus and took him under guard to a public villa in southern Rome, where he was kept as a hostage. In late 307, Galerius led a second force against Maxentius but he again failed to take Rome, and retreated north with his army mostly intact.
While Maxentius built up Rome&#x27;s defenses, Maximian made his way to Gaul to negotiate with Constantine. A deal was struck in which Constantine would marry Maximian&#x27;s younger daughter Fausta and be elevated to Augustan rank in Maxentius&#x27; secessionist regime. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius, and support Maxentius&#x27; cause in Italy but would remain neutral in the war with Galerius. The deal was sealed with a double ceremony in Trier in late 307, at which Constantine married Fausta and was declared Augustus by Maximian.

Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–8 but soon fell out with his son and in early 308 challenged his right to rule before an assembly of Roman soldiers. He spoke of Rome&#x27;s sickly government, disparaged Maxentius for having weakened it, and ripped the imperial toga from Maxentius&#x27; shoulders. He expected the soldiers to recognize him, but they sided with Maxentius; afterward, Maximian was forced to leave Italy in disgrace.

On 11 November 308, to resolve the political instability, Galerius called Diocletian (out of retirement) and Maximian to a general council meeting at the military city of Carnuntum on the upper Danube. There, Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to &quot;Caesar&quot;, with Maximinus the &quot;Caesar&quot; in the east. Licinius, a loyal military companion to Galerius, was appointed &quot;Augustus&quot; of the West. In early 309 Maximian returned to the court of Constantine in Gaul, the only court that would still accept him. After Constantine and Maximinus refused to be placated with the titles of &quot;Sons of the Augusti&quot;, they were promoted in early 310, with the result that there were now four &quot;Augusti&quot;.

==Rebellion against Constantine==

In 310, Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the Emperor was on campaign against the Franks. Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine&#x27;s army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. In Arles, Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the imperial purple. Although Maximian offered bribes to all who would support him, most of Constantine&#x27;s army remained loyal, and Maximian was compelled to leave the city. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and moved quickly to southern Gaul, where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia (Marseille). The town was better able to withstand a long siege than Arles, but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured, reproved for his crimes, and stripped of his title for the third and last time. Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310, Maximian hanged himself.

Despite the earlier rupture in relations, after Maximian&#x27;s suicide Maxentius presented himself as his father&#x27;s devoted son. He minted coins bearing his father&#x27;s deified image and proclaimed his desire to avenge his death.

Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a eunuch in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted. In addition to the propaganda, Constantine instituted a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.

Constantine defeated Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312. Maxentius died, and Italy came under Constantine&#x27;s rule. Eutropia swore on oath that Maxentius was not Maximian&#x27;s son, and Maximian&#x27;s memory was rehabilitated. His apotheosis under Maxentius was declared null and void, and he was re-consecrated as a god, probably in 317. He began appearing on Constantine&#x27;s coinage as &quot;divus&quot;, or divine, by 318, together with the deified Constantius and Claudius Gothicus. The three were hailed as Constantine&#x27;s forebears. They were called &quot;the best of emperors&quot;. Through his daughters Fausta and Theodora, Maximian was grandfather or great-grandfather to every reigning emperor from 337 to 363.

<text>In chemistry, a racemic mixture or racemate () is one that has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule or salt. Racemic mixtures are rare in nature, but many compounds are produced industrially as racemates.

==History==
The first known racemic mixture was racemic acid, which Louis Pasteur found to be a mixture of the two enantiomeric isomers of tartaric acid. He manually separated the crystals of a mixture, starting from an aqueous solution of the sodium ammonium salt of racemate tartaric acid. Pasteur benefited from the fact that ammonium tartrate salt gives enantiomeric crystals with distinct crystal forms (at 77 °F). Reasoning from the macroscopic scale down to the molecular, he reckoned that the molecules had to have non-superimposable mirror images.
A sample with only a single enantiomer is an &quot;enantiomerically pure&quot; or &quot;enantiopure&quot; compound.

==Etymology==
From racemic acid found in grapes; from Latin &quot;racemus&quot;, meaning a bunch of grapes. This acid, when naturally produced in grapes, is only the right-handed version of the molecule, better known as tartaric acid. In many Germanic languages racemic acid is called “grape acid” e.g. German &quot;traubensäure&quot; and Swedish &quot;druvsyra&quot;. Carl von Linné gave red elderberry the scientific name &quot;Sambucus racemosa&quot; as the Swedish name, &quot;druvfläder&quot;, means &#x27;grape elder&#x27;, so called because its berries grow in a grape-like cluster.

== Nomenclature ==
A racemic mixture is denoted by the prefix (±)- or dl- (for sugars the prefix - may be used), indicating an equal (1:1) mixture of dextro and levo isomers. Also the prefix rac- (or racem-) or the symbols RS and SR (all in &quot;italic&quot; letters) are used.

If the ratio is not 1:1 (or is not known), the prefix (+)/(−), - or d/l- (with a slash) is used instead.

The usage of d and l is discouraged by IUPAC.

==Properties==
A racemate is optically inactive (achiral), meaning that such materials do not rotate the polarization of plane-polarized light. Although the two enantiomers rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, the rotations cancel each other out because they are present in equal amounts of negative (-) counterclockwise (levorotatory) and positive (+) clockwise (dextrorotatory) enantiomers.

In contrast to the two pure enantiomers, which have identical physical properties except for the direction of rotation of plane-polarized light, a racemate sometimes has different properties from either of the pure enantiomers. Different melting points are most common, but different solubilities and boiling points are also possible.

Pharmaceuticals may be available as a racemate or as the pure enantiomer, which might have different potencies. Because biological systems have many chiral asymmetries, pure enantiomers frequently have very different biological effects; examples include glucose and methamphetamine.

==Crystallization==
There are four ways to crystallize a racemate; three of which H. W. B. Roozeboom had distinguished by 1899:

;Conglomerate (sometimes racemic conglomerate):If the molecules of the substance have a much greater affinity for the same enantiomer than for the opposite one, a mechanical mixture of enantiomerically pure crystals will result. The mixture of enantiomerically pure R and S crystals forms a eutectic mixture. Consequently, the melting point of the conglomerate is always lower than that of the pure enantiomer. Addition of a small amount of one enantiomer to the conglomerate increases the melting point. Roughly 10% of racemic chiral compounds crystallize as conglomerates.

;Racemic compound (sometimes true racemate):If molecules have a greater affinity for the opposite enantiomer than for the same enantiomer, the substance forms a single crystalline phase in which the two enantiomers are present in an ordered 1:1 ratio in the elementary cell. Adding a small amount of one enantiomer to the racemic compound decreases the melting point. But the pure enantiomer can have a higher or lower melting point than the compound. A special case of racemic compounds are kryptoracemic compounds (or kryptoracemates), in which the crystal itself has handedness (is enantiomorphic), despite containing both enantiomorphs in a 1:1 ratio.

;Pseudoracemate (sometimes racemic solid solution): When there is no big difference in affinity between the same and opposite enantiomers, then in contrast to the racemic compound and the conglomerate, the two enantiomers will coexist in an unordered manner in the crystal lattice. Addition of a small amount of one enantiomer changes the melting point slightly or not at all.

;Quasiracemate: A quasiracemate is a co-crystal of two similar but distinct compounds, one of which is left-handed and the other right-handed. Although chemically different, they are sterically similar (isosteric) and are still able to form a racemic crystalline phase. One of the first such racemates studied, by Pasteur in 1853, forms from a 1:2 mixture of the bis ammonium salt of (+)-tartaric acid and the bis ammonium salt of (−)-malic acid in water. Re-investigated in 2008, the crystals formed are dumbbell-shape with the central part consisting of ammonium (+)-bitartrate, whereas the outer parts are a quasiracemic mixture of ammonium (+)-bitartrate and ammonium (−)-bimalate.

==Resolution==
The separation of a racemate into its components, the individual enantiomers, is called a chiral resolution. Various methods exist for this separation, including crystallization, chromatography, and the use of various reagents.

==Synthesis==
Without a chiral influence (for example a chiral catalyst, solvent or starting material), a chemical reaction that makes a chiral product will always yield a racemate. That can make the synthesis of a racemate cheaper and easier than making the pure enantiomer, because it does not require special conditions. This fact also leads to the question of how biological homochirality evolved on what is presumed to be a racemic primordial earth.

The reagents of, and the reactions that produce, racemic mixtures are said to be &quot;not stereospecific&quot; or &quot;not stereoselective&quot;, for their indecision in a particular stereoisomerism. A frequent scenario is that of a planar species (such as an sp2 carbon atom or a carbocation intermediate) acting as an electrophile. The nucleophile will have a 50% probability of &#x27;hitting&#x27; either of the two sides of the planar grouping, thus producing a racemic mixture:

==Racemic pharmaceuticals==
Some drug molecules are chiral, and the enantiomers have different effects on biological entities. They can be sold as one enantiomer or as a racemic mixture. Examples include thalidomide, ibuprofen, cetirizine and salbutamol. A well known drug that has different effects depending on its ratio of enantiomers is amphetamine. Adderall is an unequal mixture of both amphetamine enantiomers. A single Adderall dose combines the neutral sulfate salts of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, with the dextro isomer of amphetamine saccharate and D/L-amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. The original Benzedrine was a racemic mixture, and isolated dextroamphetamine was later introduced to the market as Dexedrine. The prescription analgesic tramadol is also a racemate.

In some cases (e.g., ibuprofen and thalidomide), the enantiomers interconvert or racemize &quot;in vivo&quot;. This means that preparing a pure enantiomer for medication is largely pointless. However, sometimes samples containing pure enantiomers may be made and sold at a higher cost in cases where the use requires specifically one isomer (e.g., for a stereospecific reagent); compare omeprazole and esomeprazole. Moving from a racemic drug to a chiral specific drug may be done for a better safety profile or an improved therapeutic index. This process is called chiral switching and the resulting enantiopure drug is called a chiral switch. As examples, esomeprazole is a chiral switch of (±)-omeprazole and levocetirizine is a chiral switch of (±)-cetirizine.

While often only one enantiomer of the drug may be active, there are cases in which the other enantiomer is harmful, like salbutamol and thalidomide. The (R) enantiomer of thalidomide is effective against morning sickness, while the (S) enantiomer is teratogenic, causing birth defects. Since the drug racemizes, the drug cannot be considered safe for use by women of child-bearing age, and its use is tightly controlled when used for treating other illness.

Methamphetamine is available by prescription under the brand name Desoxyn. The active component of Desoxyn is dextromethamphetamine hydrochloride. This is the right-handed isomer of methamphetamine. The left-handed isomer of methamphetamine, levomethamphetamine, is an OTC drug that is less centrally-acting and more peripherally-acting. Methedrine during the 20th century was a 50:50 racemic mixture of both methamphetamine isomers (levo and dextro).

==Wallach&#x27;s rule==
Wallach&#x27;s rule (first proposed by Otto Wallach) states that racemic crystals tend to be denser than their chiral counterparts. This rule has been substantiated by crystallographic database analysis.

<doc id="75090" wikidata="Q773370" url="?curid=75090" title="Phocomelia">
<text>Phocomelia is a congenital condition that involves malformations of human arms and legs which result in a flipper-like appendage. A prominent cause of phocomelia is the mother being prescribed the use of the drug thalidomide during pregnancy; however, the causes of most cases are to be determined.

Occurrence in an individual results in various abnormalities to the face, limbs, ears, nose, vessels and many other underdevelopments. Although operations may improve some abnormalities, many are not surgically treatable due to the lack of nerves and other related structures.

The term is from Ancient Greek φώκη &quot;phōkē&quot;, &quot;seal (animal)&quot; + &quot;-o-&quot; interfix + μέλος &quot;melos&quot;, &quot;limb&quot; + ια &quot;-ia&quot; suffix). Phocomelia is an extremely rare congenital disorder involving malformation of the limbs (dysmelia). Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire coined the term in 1836.

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms of phocomelia syndrome are undeveloped limbs and absent pelvic bones; however, various abnormalities can occur to the limbs and bones. Usually the upper limbs are not fully formed and sections of the &quot;hands and arms may be missing&quot;. Short arm bones, fused fingers, and missing thumbs will often occur. Sometimes hands or fingers will be present but limp due to having no bones or being loosely attached. Legs and feet are also affected similarly to the arms and hands. Individuals with phocomelia will often lack thigh bones, and the hands or feet may be abnormally small or appear as stumps due to their close &quot;attachment to the body&quot;.

According to National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), individuals carrying phocomelia syndrome will generally show symptoms of growth retardation previous to and after birth. The syndrome can also cause severe mental deficiencies in infants. Infants born with phocomelia will normally have a petite head with &quot;sparse hair&quot; that may appear &quot;silvery-blonde&quot;. Hemangioma, the abnormal buildup of blood vessels, will possibly develop around the facial area at birth and the eyes may be set widely apart, a condition known as orbital hypertelorism. The pigment of the eyes will be a bluish white. Phocomelia can also cause: an undeveloped nose with slender nostrils, disfigured ears, irregularly petite jaws (a condition known as micrognathia), and a cleft lip with cleft palate. According to NORD, severe symptoms of phocomelia include:
* A fissure of the skull and a projecting brain known as encephalocele
* An accumulation of spinal fluid under the skull also known as hydrocephalus, causing vomiting and migraines
* An abnormally shaped uterus (bicornuate)
* Inability to clot blood efficiently due to a low amount of platelets running through the blood
* Malformations in the kidney and heart
* Shortened neck
* Abnormalities in the urethra

===Thalidomide syndrome symptoms===
When an individual is born with phocomelia due to drugs or pharmaceuticals, it is known as thalidomide syndrome. The symptoms of thalidomide syndrome are defined by absent or shortened limbs, causing flipper hands and feet. According to Anthony J Perri III and Sylvia Hsu they can additionally receive:
* Palsy disorder of the face
* Ear and eye abnormalities, resulting in limited/complete loss of hearing or sight
* Gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract disorders
* Ingrown genitalia
* Undeveloped/missing lungs
* Distorted digestive tract, heart, kidney
* Hypoplastic or absent bones

The infants that were exposed to thalidomide during development phases had a 40% chance of survival. The McCredie–McBride hypothesis explains that the limbs of the infants become malformed as a result of the thalidomide harming the neural tissue—simply because the neural tissue has such a large impact on formation and development of the limbs.

==Causes==

===Thalidomide===

Thalidomide was released onto the market in 1958 in West Germany under the name Contergan. Primarily prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic, thalidomide also claimed to cure &quot;anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and tension&quot;. Afterwards it was used against nausea and to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an over-the-counter drug in Germany around 1960, i.e. it could be bought without a prescription. Shortly after the drug was sold, in Germany between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with phocomelia. Only 40% of these children survived.

Research also proves that although phocomelia did exist through the 1940s and 1950s, cases of severe phocomelia multiplied in the 1960s when thalidomide was released in Germany; the direct cause was traced to thalidomide. The statistic was given that &quot;50 percent of the mothers with deformed children had taken thalidomide during the first trimester of pregnancy.&quot; Throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States, 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Thalidomide became effectively linked to death or severe disabilities among babies. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included deformed eyes, hearts, alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness.

===Genetic inheritance===
According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), when phocomelia is transmitted (in its familial genetic form) it is seen as an autosomal recessive trait and the mutation is linked to chromosome 8.

A study of Roberts syndrome, a genetic disorder showing similar symptoms to phocomelia, has shed light on the possible causes. An individual afflicted with Roberts Syndrome will have chromosome copies that do not connect at the centromeres, making them unable to line up accordingly. As a result, the newly made cells contain an excess or reduced number of chromosomes. In both Roberts syndrome and phocomelia the cells cease to develop, or die, preventing proper development of the limbs, eyes, brain, palate, or other structures.

==Treatment==
Prosthesis is a synthetic alternative for missing limbs, teeth, and various other body parts. Advances in materials, pigments and manufacturing methods during the twentieth century have rendered artificial limbs lighter in weight and more realistic-looking. Myoelectric prostheses take all their input from the nervous system and muscles at the site of attachment in the form of electric signals.

Children born with phocomelia are recommended to have a prosthetic mitten fitted to get used to the sensation of wearing an aid early on; typically a hook is added around the age of two years until the necessary tissues, bone structures, proprioception and motor coordination have developed to permit use of a myoelectric prosthetic limb.

==Notable cases==
* Matthias Buchinger (1674 - 1740) was born without hands or legs and was an artist and performer who travelled across Northern Europe. Despite his handicap Buchinger was an incredibly accomplished micro-engraver, magician, marksman and musician. He was married 4 times and had 14 children.
* Louis Joseph César Ducornet, (1806 – 1856) was a French painter who painted with his foot. He is known primarily for biblical and historical scenes, as well as portraits.
* Ame Barnbrook was born without arms and only the lower half of her left leg, and three toes. She has a rarer form of phocomelia, meaning all of her limbs are affected. She graduated from the University of Wollongong with a Bachelor of Creative Arts. Barnbrook plays the trumpet with her foot and is a competitive sailor. She sails a SKUD18 at world championship level. She did not qualify for the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, but she trained for the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. 
* Sarah Biffen (c. 1784 – 1850), was an English painter born without arms and only vestigial legs. She learnt to paint by mouth, was taught by William Craig, and exhibited at the Royal Academy. Biffen was commissioned to paint miniatures of the Royal Family, and Queen Victoria later awarded her pension.
* Eli Bowen (1844 - 1924), who made his living performing in sideshows.
* Mat Fraser (1962 - ) was born with phocomelia due to his mother taking thalidomide while she was pregnant. He is known as the drummer of rock bands including Fear of Sex, The Reasonable Strollers, Joyride, The Grateful Dub, and Living in Texas. He is also an actor and performing artist.
* Rahma Haruna (~1996 - 2016) was born in Nigeria with severe phocomelia. She had no limbs, except for a partially formed right hand that was attached to her axilla. Rahma&#x27;s story came out when a local journalist saw her on the street with her brother, after which the story was shared widely on social media. She died at the age of 19, on 25 December 2016.
* Alison Lapper (1965 - ) was born in England with phocomelia. She is arm deficient and has shortened bones and legs. Lapper graduated from Brighton University in 1994, established herself as a visual artist, and in 2000 gave birth to a son, Parys. Lapper produces cards and calendars for The Mouth and Foot Painters&#x27; Association. She does not wear prosthetic limbs.
* Hee Ah Lee (1985 - ), a South Korean pianist who has two fingers on each hand.
* Thomas Quasthoff (1959 - ), a German Lieder and opera singer.
* Enos Stutsman (1826 - 1874), Pioneer settler of North Dakota. Namesake of Stutsman County.
* Ronan Tynan (1964 - ) was born in Ireland with phocomelia. He became a track and field athlete, competing in the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics. Tynan went on to a career as a physician, and later, a singer.
* Sheetal Devi (2007 - ), born in India, is the first and only armless para-archer to reach world number one in compound women&#x27;s para-archery ranking.

<text>Alexander Helios (; late 40 BC – unknown, but possibly between 29 and 25 BC) was a Ptolemaic prince and son of Pharaoh Cleopatra VII of the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman triumvir Mark Antony. Alexander&#x27;s fraternal twin sister was Cleopatra Selene II. Cleopatra named her son after Alexander the Great. His second name in Ancient Greek means &quot;Sun&quot;; this was the counterpart of his twin sister&#x27;s second name Selene (Σελήνη), meaning &quot;Moon&quot;.

==Life==
Alexander Helios was born and educated in Alexandria. He was the second of Cleopatra&#x27;s three sons, Caesarion being the oldest. In late 34 BC, at the Donations of Alexandria, Alexander Helios, aged six, was dressed in a Median costume and was given the title king of Kings and the ruler of Armenia, Media, Parthia and any countries yet to be discovered between the Euphrates and Indus Rivers. Although most of this territory stood outside of their control at that time. These areas were, in fact, already ruled by Artaxias II of Armenia (who had been elected King that same year after Antony captured his father Artavasdes II), Artavasdes I of Media Atropatene and Phraates IV of Parthia. In 33 BC, Alexander was engaged to his distant relative Iotapa, a princess of Media Atropatene and daughter of Artavasdes I. However, Mark Antony and Cleopatra were defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. The next year, they committed suicide as Octavian and his army invaded Egypt. Iotapa left Egypt to return to her father and later married her maternal cousin King Mithridates III of Commagene, who was of Armenian and Greek descent.

When Octavian conquered Egypt he spared Alexander but took him, his sister and his brother, Ptolemy Philadelphus, from Egypt to Rome. Octavian celebrated his military triumph in Rome by parading the children in heavy gold chains in the streets behind an effigy of their mother clutching an asp to her arm. It is unclear whether Ptolemy Philadelphus survived the journey to Rome, as Cassius Dio mentions the twins only in his &quot;History of Rome&quot;. Octavian gave the children to Octavia Minor, his elder sister and a former wife of Mark Antony, to be raised under her guardianship in Rome. They were generously received by Octavia, who educated them with her own children.

===Later life===
The fate of Alexander Helios is unknown. Plutarch, Cassius Dio and Suetonius state that Octavian killed Antony&#x27;s son Marcus Antonius Antyllus and Cleopatra&#x27;s son with Julius Caesar, Caesarion. The only further mention of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus comes from Cassius Dio, who states that when their sister, Cleopatra Selene II, married King Juba II, Octavian (by then named Augustus) spared the lives of Alexander Helios and Ptolemy Philadelphus as a favor to the couple. After Helios arrives in Rome he disappears from historical records.

<doc id="75094" wikidata="Q155375" url="?curid=75094" title="Archibald Hill">
<text>Archibald Vivian Hill (26 September 1886 – 3 June 1977), better known to friends and colleagues as A. V. Hill, was a British physiologist, one of the founders of the diverse disciplines of biophysics and operations research. He shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his elucidation of the production of heat and mechanical work in muscles.

== Biography ==
Born in Bristol, he was educated at Blundell&#x27;s School and graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge as third wrangler in the mathematics tripos before turning to physiology. While still an undergraduate at Trinity College, he derived in 1909 what came to be known as the Langmuir equation. 

This is closely related to Michaelis–Menten kinetics. In this paper, Hill&#x27;s first publication, he derived both the equilibrium form of the Langmuir equation, and also the exponential approach to equilibrium. The paper, written under the supervision of John Newport Langley, is a landmark in the history of receptor theory, because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the &quot;receptive substance&quot; at the neuromuscular junction.

While a student he had enrolled in the Officers Training Corps; he was a crack shot. In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, Hill became the musketry officer of the Cambridgeshire Regiment.

At the end of 1915, while home on leave he was asked by Horace Darwin from the Ministry of Munitions to come for a day to advise them on how to train anti-aircraft gunners. On site, Hill immediately proposed a simple two mirror method to determine airplanes&#x27; heights. Transferred to Munitions, he realized that the mirrors could measure where smoke shells burst and if he fitted this data with the equations describing a shell&#x27;s flight they could provide accurate range tables for anti-aircraft guns. To measure and compute he assembled the Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section, a team of men too old for conscription, Ralph H. Fowler (a wounded officer), and lads too young for service including Douglas Hartree, Arthur Milne and James Crowther. Someone dubbed his motley group &quot;Hill&#x27;s Brigands&quot;, which they proudly adopted. Later in the war they also worked on locating enemy planes from their sound. He sped between their working sites on his beloved motorcycle. At the end of the war, Major Hill issued certificates to more than one hundred Brigands. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

In 1923, he succeeded Ernest Starling as professor of physiology at University College London, a few years later becoming a Royal Society Research professor there, where he remained until retirement in 1951. In 1933, he became with William Beveridge and Lord Rutherford a founder member and vice-president of the Academic Assistance Council (which in 1936 became the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning). By the start of the Second World War, the organisation had saved 900 academics (18 of whom went on to win Nobel Prizes) from Nazi persecution. He prominently displayed in his laboratory a toy figure of Adolf Hitler with saluting arm upraised, which he explained was in gratitude for all the scientists Germany had expelled, some of whom were now working with him. Hill believed that &quot;Laughter is the best detergent for nonsense&quot;.

In 1935, he served with Patrick Blackett and Sir Henry Tizard on the committee that gave birth to radar. He was also biological secretary of the Royal Society; William Henry Bragg was president. Both had been frustrated by the delay in putting scientists to work in the previous war. The Royal Society collated a list of scientists and Hill represented the Society at the Ministry of Labour. When the war came Hill led a campaign to liberate refugee scientists who had been interned. He served as an independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridge University from 1940 to 1945. In 1940, he was posted to the British Embassy in Washington to promote war research in the still neutral United States. He was authorized to swap secrets with the Americans, but this could not work: how do you place a value on another&#x27;s secret? Hill saw the answer and persuaded the British to show the Americans everything they were working on (except for the atomic bomb). The mobilization of Allied scientists was one of the major successes in the war.

He visited India between November 1943 and April 1944 to survey scientific and technological research. His suggestions influenced the establishment of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) in the following decade.

After the war he rebuilt his laboratory at University College and vigorously carried on research. In 1951, his advocacy was rewarded by the establishment of a Biophysics Department under his leadership. 

In 1952, he became head of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and Secretary General of the International Council of Scientific Unions. He was President of the Marine Biological Association from 1955 to 1960. In 1967, he retired to Cambridge where he gradually lost the use of his legs. He died &quot;held in the greatest affection by more than a hundred scientific descendants all over the world&quot;.

== Cooperativity of protein binding and enzyme kinetics ==
Although Hill&#x27;s work in muscle physiology is probably the most important, and certainly responsible for his Nobel Prize, he is also very well known in biochemistry for the &quot;Hill equation&quot;, which is used to quantify binding of oxygen to haemoglobin, written here as a kinetic equation:

: formula_1

Here formula_2 is the rate of reaction at concentration formula_3 of substrate, formula_4 is the rate at saturation, formula_5 is the value of formula_3 that gives formula_7, and the exponent formula_8 is a parameter that expresses the degree of departure from Michaelis–Menten kinetics: &quot;positive cooperativity&quot; for formula_9, no cooperativity for formula_10, and &quot;negative cooperativity&quot; for formula_11. Note that there is no implication that formula_8 is an integer, and in most experimental cases, apart from the trivial case of formula_10, it is not. Although many authors use formula_14 or formula_15 rather than formula_8 these symbols are misleading if taken to imply that it shows the number of binding sites on the protein. Hill himself avoided any such interpretation.

The equation can be rearranged as follows:

: formula_17

This shows that when the Hill equation is accurately obeyed a plot of formula_18 gives a straight line of slope formula_8. This is called a &quot;Hill plot&quot;. In practice the line is uually not straght, and is curved at the extremes.

== Muscle physiology ==
Hill made many exacting measurements of the heat released when skeletal muscles contract and relax. A key finding was that heat is produced during contraction, which requires investment of chemical energy, but not during relaxation, which is passive. His earliest measurements used equipment left behind by the Swedish physiologist Magnus Blix, Hill measured a temperature rise of only 0.003 °C. After publication he learned that German physiologists had already reported on heat and muscle contraction and he went to Germany to learn more about their work. He continually improved his apparatus to make it more sensitive and to reduce the time lag between the heat released by the preparation and its recording by his thermocouple. 
Hill is regarded, along with Hermann Helmholtz, as one of the founders of biophysics.

Hill returned briefly to Cambridge in 1919 before taking the chair in physiology at the Victoria University of Manchester in 1920 in succession to William Stirling. Using himself as the subject — he ran every morning from 7:15 to 10:30 — he showed that running a dash relies on energy stores which afterwards are replenished by increased oxygen consumption. Paralleling the work of German Otto Fritz Meyerhof, Hill elucidated the processes whereby mechanical work is produced in muscles. The two shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for this work. Hill introduced the concepts of maximal oxygen uptake and oxygen debt in 1922.

== Personal life ==
In 1913, he married Margaret Neville Keynes (1885-1974), daughter of the economist John Neville Keynes, and sister of the economist John Maynard Keynes and the surgeon Geoffrey Keynes. They had two sons and two daughters:

* Polly Hill (1914–2005), economist, married K.A.C. Humphreys, registrar of the West African Examinations Council.
* David Keynes Hill (1915–2002), physiologist, married Stella Mary Humphrey
* Maurice Hill (1919–1966), oceanographer, married Philippa Pass
* Janet Hill (1918–2000) child psychiatrist, married the immunologist John Herbert Humphrey.

== Honors and awards ==
* Officer of the Order of the British Empire (1918)
* Fellow of the Royal Society (1918)
* Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1922)
* In 1926, he was invited to deliver the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;Nerves and Muscles: How We Feel and Move&quot;.
* International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1934)
* International Member of the American Philosophical Society (1938)
* Associate Fellow in the National Academy of Kinesiology (1938)
* International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences (1941)
* Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (1946)
* Copley Medal of the Royal Society (1948)
* President of the British Association (1952)

== Blue plaque ==

On 9 September 2015, an English Heritage Blue plaque was erected at Hill&#x27;s former home, 16 Bishopswood Road, Highgate, where he had lived from 1923 to 1967. Since then the house had been divided into flats and owned by Highgate School, where Hill was a Governor from 1929 to 1960. It has now been sold, redeveloped and renamed as Hurstbourne. In Hill&#x27;s time, according to his grandson Nicholas Humphrey, regular guests at the house included 18 exiled Nobel laureates, his brother-in-law, the economist John Maynard Keynes, and also friends as diverse and unexpected as Sigmund Freud and Stephen Hawking, he met during the course of his long and extraordinary life. After-dinner conversations in the drawing room would inevitably involve passionate debates about science or politics. &quot;Every Sunday we would have to attend a tea party at grandpa’s house and apart from entertaining some extraordinary guests, he would devise some great games for us, such as frog racing in the garden or looking through the lens of a (dissected) sheep’s eye&quot;. Sir Ralph Kohn FRS who proposed the Blue plaque, said: &quot;The Nobel Prize winner A. V. Hill contributed vastly to our understanding of muscle physiology. His work has resulted in wide-ranging application in sports medicine. As an outstanding Humanitarian and Parliamentarian, he was uncompromising in his condemnation of the Nazi regime for its persecution of scientists and others. A. V. Hill played a crucial role in assisting and rescuing many refugees to continue their work in this country&quot;.

<doc id="75095" wikidata="Q2528157" url="?curid=75095" title="Asian brown cloud">
<text>The Indian Ocean brown cloud or Asian brown cloud is a layer of air pollution that recurrently covers parts of South Asia, namely the northern Indian Ocean, India, and Pakistan. Viewed from satellite photos, the cloud appears as a giant brown stain hanging in the air over much of the Indian subcontinent and the Indian Ocean every year between October and February, possibly also during earlier and later months. The term was coined in reports from the UNEP Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX). It was found to originate mostly due to farmers burning stubble in northern Indian states such as Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, as well as in the Punjab region of Pakistan. The debilitating air quality in Delhi is also due to the stubble burning in Punjab.

The term &quot;atmospheric brown cloud&quot; is used for a more generic context not specific to the Asian region.

==Causes==
The Asian brown cloud is created by a range of airborne particles and pollutants from combustion (e.g., woodfires, cars, and factories), biomass burning and industrial processes with incomplete burning. The cloud is associated with the winter monsoon (October/November to February/March) during which there is no rain to wash pollutants from the air.

==Observations==
This pollution layer was observed during the Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) intensive field observation in 1999 and described in the UNEP impact assessment study published 2002. Scientists in India claimed that the Asian Brown cloud is not something specific to Asia. 
Subsequently, when the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) organized a follow-up international project, the subject of study was renamed &quot;the Atmospheric Brown Cloud&quot; with focus on Asia.

The cloud was also reported by NASA in 2004 and 2007.

Although aerosol particles are generally associated with a global cooling effect, recent studies have shown that they can actually have a global warming effect in certain regions such as the Himalayas.

==Impacts==

===Health problems===
One major impact is on health. A 2002 study indicated nearly two million people die each year, in Asia alone, from conditions related to the brown cloud.

===Regional weather===
A second assessment study was published in 2008. It highlighted regional concerns regarding:
* Changes of rainfall patterns with the Asian monsoon, as well as a delaying of the start of the Asian monsoon, by several weeks. The observed weakening Indian monsoon and in China northern drought and southern flooding is influenced by the clouds.
* Increase in rainfall over the Australian Top End and Kimberley regions. A CSIRO study has found that by displacing the thermal equator southwards via cooling of the air over East Asia, the monsoon which brings most of the rain to these regions has been intensified and displaced southward.
* Retreat of the Hindu Kush-Himalayan glaciers and snow packs. The cause is attributed to rising air temperatures that are more pronounced in elevated regions, a combined warming effect of greenhouse gases and the Asian Brown Cloud. Also deposition of black carbon decreases the reflection and exacerbates the retreat. Asian glacial melting could lead to water shortages and floods for the hundreds of millions of people who live downstream.
* Decrease of crop harvests. Elevated concentrations of surface ozone are likely to affect crop yields negatively. The impact is crop specific.

===Cyclone intensity in Arabian Sea===
A 2011 study found that pollution is making Arabian Sea cyclones more intense as the atmospheric brown clouds has been producing weakening wind patterns which prevent wind shear patterns that historically have prohibited cyclones in the Arabian Sea from becoming major storms. This phenomenon was found responsible for the formation of stronger storms in 2007 and 2010 that were the first recorded storms to enter the Gulf of Oman.

===Global warming and dimming===
The 2008 report also addressed the global concern of warming and concluded that the brown clouds have masked 20 to 80 percent of greenhouse gas forcing in the past century. The report suggested that air pollution regulations can have large amplifying effects on global warming.

Another major impact is on the polar ice caps. Black carbon (soot) in the Asian Brown Cloud may be reflecting sunlight and dimming Earth below but it is warming other places by absorbing incoming radiation and warming the atmosphere and whatever it touches. Black carbon is three times more effective than carbon dioxide—the most common greenhouse gas—at melting polar ice and snow. Black carbon in snow causes about three times the temperature change as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. On snow—even at concentrations below five parts per billion–dark carbon triggers melting, and may be responsible for as much as 94 percent of Arctic warming.

<doc id="75097" wikidata="Q39589" url="?curid=75097" title="Caesarion">
<text>Ptolemy XV Caesar (; , ; 47 BC – late August 30 BC), nicknamed Caesarion (, , &quot;Little Caesar&quot;), was the last pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt, reigning with his mother Cleopatra VII from 2 September 44 BC until her death by 12 August 30 BC, then as sole ruler until his death was ordered by Octavian (who would become the first Roman emperor as Augustus).

Caesarion was the eldest son of Cleopatra and the only known biological son of Julius Caesar, after whom he was named. He was the last member of the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt.

==Early life==

Ptolemy Caesar was born in Egypt in mid to late 47 BC. His mother Cleopatra gave him the royal names Theos Philopator Philometor (lit. &#x27;father-loving, mother-loving God&#x27;) and insisted that he was the son of Roman politician and dictator Julius Caesar. While he was said to have inherited Caesar&#x27;s looks and manner, Caesar did not officially acknowledge him. All accusations of bastardy against Caesarion were cast from a Roman perspective; their intention was not to portray Caesarion as inappropriate for the throne of Egypt, but rather to deny that he was Julius&#x27; heir by Roman law. One of Caesar&#x27;s supporters, Gaius Oppius, even wrote a pamphlet which attempted to prove that Caesar could not have fathered Caesarion. Nevertheless, Caesar may have allowed Caesarion to use his name. The matter became contentious when Caesar&#x27;s adopted son, Octavian, came into conflict with Cleopatra.

Caesarion spent two of his infant years, from 46 to 44 BC, in Rome, where he and his mother were Caesar&#x27;s guests at his villa, Horti Caesaris. Cleopatra hoped that her son would eventually succeed his father as the head of the Roman Republic, as well as of Egypt. After Caesar&#x27;s assassination on 15 March 44 BC, Cleopatra and Caesarion returned to Egypt. Caesarion was named co-ruler by his mother on 2 September 44 BC at the age of three, although he was pharaoh in name only, with Cleopatra keeping actual authority. Cleopatra compared her relationship to her son with that of the Egyptian goddess Isis and her divine child Horus.

There is no historical record of Caesarion between 44 BC until the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC. Two years later he also appears at the Donations of Alexandria. Cleopatra and Antony staged both &quot;Donations&quot; to donate lands dominated by Rome and Parthia to Cleopatra&#x27;s children: Caesarion, the twins Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus (the last three were his maternal half-siblings fathered by Mark Antony). Octavian gave public approval to the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC, which have been described as an Antonian strategy to rule the East making use of Cleopatra&#x27;s unique royal Seleucid lineage in the regions donated.

== Pharaoh ==
In 34 BC, Antony granted further eastern lands and titles to Caesarion and his own three children with Cleopatra in the Donations of Alexandria. Caesarion was proclaimed to be a god, a son of [a] god, and &quot;King of Kings&quot;. This grandiose title was &quot;unprecedented in the management of Roman client-king relationships&quot; and could be seen as &quot;threatening the &#x27;greatness&#x27; of the Roman people&quot;. Antony also declared Caesarion to be Caesar&#x27;s true son and heir. This declaration was a direct threat to Octavian (whose claim to power was based on his status as Julius Caesar&#x27;s grandnephew and adopted son). These proclamations partly caused the fatal breach in Antony&#x27;s relations with Octavian, who used Roman resentment over the Donations to gain support for war against Antony and Cleopatra.

== Death ==

After the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Cleopatra seems to have groomed Caesarion to take over as &quot;sole ruler without his mother&quot;. She may have intended to go into exile, perhaps with Antony, who may have hoped that he would be allowed to retire as Lepidus had. Caesarion reappears in the historical record in 30 BC, when Octavian invaded Egypt and searched for him. Cleopatra may have sent Caesarion, 17 years old at the time, to the Red Sea port of Berenice for safety, possibly as part of plans for an escape to India. Plutarch does say that Caesarion was sent to India, but also that he was lured back by false promises of the kingdom of Egypt: Caesarion, who was said to be Cleopatra&#x27;s son by Julius Caesar, was sent by his mother, with much treasure, into India, by way of Ethiopia. There Rhodon, another tutor like Theodorus, persuaded him to go back, on the ground that [Octavian] Caesar invited him to take the kingdom.

Octavian captured the city of Alexandria on 1 August 30 BC, the date that marks the official annexation of Egypt to the Roman Republic. Around this time Mark Antony and Cleopatra died, traditionally said to be by suicide.

Octavian may have temporarily considered permitting Caesarion to succeed his mother and rule Egypt (though now a smaller and weaker kingdom), however, he is supposed to have had Caesarion executed in Alexandria in late August, possibly on 29 August 30 BC, following the advice of his companion Arius Didymus, who said &quot;Too many Caesars is not good&quot; (a pun on a line in Homer). Surviving information on the death of Caesarion is scarce. Octavian then assumed absolute control of Egypt. The year 30 BC was considered the first year of the new ruler&#x27;s reign according to the traditional chronological system of Egypt.

==Depictions==

Few images of Caesarion survive. He is thought to be depicted in a partial statue found in the harbour of Alexandria in 1997 and is also portrayed twice in relief, as an adult pharaoh, with his mother on the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. His infant image appears on some bronze coins of Cleopatra.

==Egyptian names==
In addition to his Greek name and nicknames, Caesarion also had a full set of royal names in the Egyptian language:
*&quot;Iwapanetjer entynehem&quot; – &quot;Heir of the god who saves&quot;
*&quot;Setepenptah&quot; – &quot;Chosen of Ptah&quot;
*&quot;Irmaatenre&quot; – &quot;Carrying out the rule of Ra&quot; or &quot;Sun of righteousness&quot;
*&quot;Sekhemankhamun&quot; – &quot;Living image of Amun&quot;

<text>Bovines (subfamily Bovinae) comprise a diverse group of 10 genera of medium to large-sized ungulates, including cattle, bison, African buffalo, water buffalos, and the four-horned and spiral-horned antelopes. The members of this group are classified into loose tribes rather than formal subgroups, as the evolutionary relationships within the groups are still uncertain. General characteristics include cloven hooves and usually at least one of the sexes of a species having true horns. The largest extant bovine is the gaur.

In many countries, bovid milk and meat is used as food by humans. Cattle are kept as livestock almost everywhere except in parts of India and Nepal, where they are considered sacred by most Hindus. Bovids are used as draft animals and as riding animals. Small breeds of domestic bovid, such as the Miniature Zebu, are kept as pets. Bovid leather is durable and flexible and is used to produce a wide range of goods including clothing and bags.

<text>Seminole County (, ) is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 470,856, making it the 13th-most populated county in Florida. Its county seat and largest city is Sanford. Seminole County is part of the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
On July 21, 1821, two counties formed Florida: Escambia to the west and St. Johns to the east. In 1824, the area to the south of St. Johns County was designated Mosquito County, with its seat at Enterprise. The county&#x27;s name was changed to Orange County in 1845 when Florida became a state, and over the next 70 years several other counties were created. Seminole County was one of the last to split.

Seminole County was created on April 25, 1913, out of the northern portion of Orange County by the Florida Legislature. It was named for the Seminole people who historically lived throughout the area. The name &quot;Seminole&quot; is thought to be derived from the Spanish word &quot;cimarron,&quot; meaning &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;runaway&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (10.4%) is water. It is Florida&#x27;s fourth-smallest county by land area and third-smallest by total area.

Seminole County&#x27;s location between Volusia County and Orange County has made it one of Florida&#x27;s fastest-growing counties. The Greater Orlando Metropolitan District which includes Seminole, Osceola, and the surrounding counties of Lake and Orange counties, together with neighboring Volusia and Brevard counties create a viable, progressive, and diverse setting for economic growth and residential development.

==Government and politics==
Seminole County is part of the strongly Republican belt of central and southwest Florida that was the first portion of the state to politically distance itself from the &quot;Solid South&quot;, until Joe Biden carried the county in 2020; the last Democratic Party candidate to win the county in a presidential election had been Harry Truman in 1948, and the last Democrat to win a majority of votes in the county being Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. , Republicans outnumbered Democrats 122,489 to 113,260, in registered voters.










The government operates under a County Charter adopted in 1989 and amended in November 1994. Policymaking and the legislative authority are vested in the Board of County Commissioners, a five-member board elected to four-year terms in partisan, countywide elections and from single member districts. The board adopts the county budget, levies property taxes and other fees, and hires the county manager and county attorney. In addition to the board, five constitutional officers are elected to partisan, four-year terms in accordance with the constitution of the State of Florida.

The constitutional officers, clerk of the circuit and county courts, sheriff, tax collector, property appraiser, and supervisor of elections, maintain separate accounting records and budgets. The board funds a portion or, in certain instances, all of the operating budgets of the county&#x27;s constitutional officers.

The county provides a full range of services: the construction and maintenance of the county&#x27;s infrastructure, public safety, recreation, health and human services, and development and protection of the physical and economic environment.

In addition to the county government described above, there are other political entities which are controlled by the county, but have their own appointed boards; the Seminole County Expressway Authority, the Seminole County Port Authority, the Fred R. Wilson Memorial Law Library and the US 17-92 Community Redevelopment Agency.

===County elected officials===
Republicans control all of Seminole County&#x27;s partisan elected offices. In 2020, despite Joe Biden narrowly winning Seminole County in the presidential election, Republican candidates for county office won by wide margins over their Democratic opponents.

<text>Sumter County is a county located in the central portion of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population is 129,752. It has the oldest median age (68.3 years) of any US county and the highest percentage of residents aged 65 and older—at 55.6% in 2014–2018 (in 2009–2013). Its county seat is Bushnell, and the largest city is Wildwood. Although the community of The Villages has more residents, it is a part of unincorporated Sumter County. 

Sumter County coincides with the Wildwood-The Villages, FL Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the Orlando-Lakeland-Deltona, FL Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Sumter County was created in 1853. It was named for General Thomas Sumter, a general in the American Revolutionary War. The county in the past, and to this day by some, is nicknamed &quot;Hog County&quot; most likely because it is home to a large population of wild hogs. Hog hunting is still a favorite pastime of locals in the more rural portions of the county.

Although long extremely rural, in recent years Sumter County has sustained an exceptionally large increase in population, almost solely due to the expansion of The Villages retirement complex, a significant portion of which is in the county. This has dramatically changed the demographics of the county and has brought in significant income.

Sumter County was affected by the massive Florida tornado outbreak of February 2, 2007, and a state of emergency was declared.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (5.7%) is water.

The MSA was first defined in or before 2003 as The Villages, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA) with The Villages as the principal city. The area was designated an MSA in or before 2013. In 2023, Wildwood was added as a principal city and the name of the MSA.

<text>Suwannee County is a county located in the north central portion of the state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 43,474, up from 41,551 in 2010. Its county seat is Live Oak. Suwannee County was a dry county until August 2011, when the sale of alcoholic beverages became legal in the county.

==History==
Suwannee County was created in 1858, as railways were constructed through the area connecting it to Jacksonville, Tallahassee, and points north. It was named after the Suwannee River, which forms the county&#x27;s northern, western, and much of its southern border. The word &quot;Suwannee&quot; may either be a corruption of the Spanish &quot;San Juan&quot; (&quot;Saint John&quot;) or from the Cherokee &quot;sawani&quot; (&quot;echo river&quot;).

During the American Civil War, Company K of the 3rd Florida Infantry Regiment was composed almost entirely of men from Suwannee County. In 1884, Florida&#x27;s volunteer militia was reorganized and the Suwanee Rifles were established. The Rifles were among the twelve companies from Florida that were activated for service during the Spanish–American War.

The rural areas supported numerous lumber and turpentine camps. In the 1930s, anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston did research in North Florida timber camps.

==Geography==

==Libraries==
Suwannee County is served by the Suwannee River Regional Library System, which contains eight branches and also serves Hamilton and Madison counties.
* Branford
* Dowling Park
* Greenville
* Jasper
* Jennings
* Lee
* Live Oak
* Madison
* White Springs
Suwannee River Regional Library was first formed by a contractual agreement between Suwannee and Lafayette counties, making it the first regional library in Florida. In 1957, the local Library Board learned that they might get a grant for a new library if they joined with another county. The Suwannee Board convinced the Mayo Woman&#x27;s Club in Lafayette County to have their county join with Suwannee County and organize the first library region in Florida. With the formation of the duo-county, Suwannee-Lafayette Library Region, it immediately received $28,224 in funds. A small library was established at Mayo in Lafayette County in October 1957. The library started as a 3,100 book collection but soon grew to some 10,000 titles, some loaned from the State Library. A bookmobile was also added and put on the road.

After being successful with its new library, the Suwannee River Regional Library System was approached by a number of nearby counties interested in the project, and in 1959 Columbia, Gilchrist, Hamilton, Madison and Taylor counties qualified for membership and became a part of the system. Greenville, Jasper, Lake City, Madison, and Perry had small libraries operated by a Woman&#x27;s Club that were also absorbed into the organization. By 1960, the library system now had 23,500 books in its collection, 3,000 of which were a gift from the Miami Public Library. On August 2 of that year, Dixie County became the last one to be invited to join in. Later, the Cross City library observed its official opening December 1, 1960. In May 1990 Madison County expanded by establishing a small satellite branch library in the Town of Lee. The Suwannee County library in Live Oak is the headquarters of the organization, as it has been since the establishment of the Suwannee River Regional Library System.

==Transportation==

===Airports===
Suwannee County is accessed by air from Suwannee County Airport, located two miles west of Live Oak. It is a publicly operated airport run by the county government that has a paved runway in excess of 4,000 feet, major aircraft maintenance, training, car rental, as well as selling 100LL aviation fuel from the FBO. There are also many private airparks scattered throughout the county.

===Railroads===
Suwannee County has one surviving railroad line. The primary one is a Florida Gulf &amp; Atlantic Railroad line formerly owned by CSX, Seaboard System Railroad, Seaboard Coast Line Industries and Seaboard Air Line Railroad that served Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; until it was truncated to New Orleans in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. Union Depot and Atlantic Coast Line Freight Station was Suwannee County&#x27;s premiere railroad station on the corner of US 129 &amp; SR 136 in Live Oak, and served both the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and Seaboard Air Line Railroad but has not been in use since 1971, with the termination of the Louisville and Nashville and Seaboard Coast Line&#x27;s &quot;Gulf Wind&quot; (New Orleans - Jacksonville). The Seaboard Air Line operated two passenger trains a day in each direction until 1966 or 1967. Various abandoned lines also exist within the county, one of which was converted into the Suwannee River Greenway Trail, along the southeastern part of the county.

===Major roads===

* (Interstate 10) is the main interstate highway through Swuannee County, running west and east through the panhandle from Alabama to Jacksonville. Three interchanges exist in the county at US 90 east of Falmouth, (Exit 275), US 129 in Live Oak (Exit 283), and CR 137 north of Wellborn (Exit 292).
* (Interstate 75) also is an interstate highway, running south and north, but only in a remote area of eastern Suwannee County known as Pouchers Corner, and only has an interchange with SR 136 (Exit 439).
* runs from southeast to northwest along the southern portion of the county, from the Ichetucknee River Bridge at the Ichetucknee Springs State Park thru the Frank R. Norris Bridge over the Suwannee River in Branford.
* was the main west-to-east route through Suwannee County until it was supplanted by I-10.
* is the main south-to-north route within the county. It enters the county at a bridge across the Santa Fe River north of Bell, Florida in Gilcrhrist County, then joins US 27 from Hildreth to Branford, only to continue north through Live Oak eventually crossing the Suwannee River, this time entering Hamilton County.
* is a south to north state highway that enters Suwannee County from the Hal W. Adams Bridge then runs northeast towards Live Oak, where it serves as a hidden state road for US 129 north through the Hamilton County Line. 
* ; Columbia County Road 136 is a county extension of SR 136. It begins at Columbia CR 250 in Dowling Park and runs along the east side of the Suwannee River, then turns east towards SR 51 in Live Oak. The route overlaps SR 51 even as that route overlaps US 129, then leaves US 129.SR 51 to continue east, becoming a state road before the interchange with I-75 only to cross the Hamilton-Columbia county line.
* is a northeast to southwest road that spans from Branford, and terminates at US 90 in western Lake City, just east of US 90&#x27;s interchange with I-75 in Columbia County.

<doc id="75109" wikidata="Q58328" url="?curid=75109" title="Jean-Baptiste Biot">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Biot (; ; 21 April 1774 – 3 February 1862) was a French physicist, astronomer, and mathematician who co-discovered the Biot–Savart law of magnetostatics with Félix Savart, established the reality of meteorites, made an early balloon flight, and studied the polarization of light.

The biot (a CGS unit of electrical current), the mineral biotite, and Cape Biot in eastern Greenland were named in his honour.

== Biography ==
Jean-Baptiste Biot was born in Paris on 21 April 1774 the son of Joseph Biot, a treasury official.

He was educated at Lyceum Louis-le-Grand and École Polytechnique in 1794. Biot served in the artillery before he was appointed professor of mathematics at Beauvais in 1797. He later went on to become a professor of physics at the Collège de France around 1800, and three years later was elected as a member of the French Academy of Sciences. In July 1804, Biot joined Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac for the first scientific hot-air balloon ride to measure how the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field varies with elevation (NNDB 2009, Reese 2004, O&#x27;Connor and Robertson 1997). They reached a height of 4000 metres (13,100 feet) (NNDB 2009, Reese 2004). Later, in Sept. 1804, a solo flight took Gay-Lussac up to 7010 metres (23,000 ft) (quite dangerous without supplementary oxygen (Reese 2004)).

Biot was also a member of the Legion of Honour; he was elected chevalier in 1814 and commander in 1849. In 1815, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London, in 1816 a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In addition, Biot received the Rumford Medal in 1840, awarded by the Royal Society in the field of thermal or optical properties of matter. (O’Connor and Robertson 1997). In 1850 Jean-Baptiste Biot published in the &quot;Journal des savants&quot; a 7-page memoir from his recollections of the period of the late 1790s and early 1800s concerning his encounters with Laplace.

Jean-Baptiste Biot had a single son, Édouard Constant Biot, an engineer and Sinologist, born in 1803. Edouard died in 1850 and his father made extraordinary efforts to ready for publication the second half of Edouard&#x27;s last book, a reference translation of the Chinese classic &quot;Tcheou-li&quot;. It had been left in manuscript, unfinished. To publish it in correct form, Jean-Baptiste Biot wrote, he had to consult Stanislas Julien, the famous Sinologist, but also, especially for the translation of the most difficult part, the Kaogongji, he himself visited many workshops and questioned artisans and craftsmen about their methods and vocabulary in order to verify his son&#x27;s work. Biot&#x27;s translation remains to this day the only translation into a Western language of this book.

He died in Paris on 3 February 1862.

== Work ==

=== Electromagnetism ===
Jean-Baptiste Biot made many contributions to the scientific community in his lifetime – most notably in optics, magnetism, and astronomy. In 1804, he used lines of equal magnetic field intensity in an article authored together with the Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. he Biot–Savart law in magnetism is named after Biot and his colleague Félix Savart for their work in 1820. In their experiment they showed a connection between electricity and magnetism by &quot;starting with a long vertical wire and a magnetic needle some horizontal distance apart [and showing] that running a current through the wire caused the needle to move&quot; (Parsley).

=== Meteorites ===
In 1803 Biot was sent by the Académie française to report back on 3000 meteorites that fell on L&#x27;Aigle, in Normandy, France (see L&#x27;Aigle (meteorite)). He found that the meteorites, called &quot;stones&quot; at the time, were from outer space. With his report, Biot helped support the German physicist Ernst Chladni&#x27;s argument, published in 1794, that meteorites were debris from space.
Prior to Biot&#x27;s thorough investigation of the meteorites that fell near l&#x27;Aigle, France in 1803, very few truly believed that rocks found on Earth could have extraterrestrial origins. There were anecdotal tales of unusual rocks found on the ground after fireballs had been seen in the sky, but such stories were often dismissed as fantasy. Serious debate concerning the unusual rocks began in 1794 when Ernst Chladni published a book claiming that such rocks had an extraterrestrial origin (Westrum). Only after Biot was able to analyse the rocks at l&#x27;Aigle was it commonly accepted that the fireballs seen in the sky were meteors falling through the atmosphere. Since Biot&#x27;s time, analysis of meteorites has resulted in accurate measurements of the chemical composition of the solar system. The composition and position of meteors in the solar system have also given astronomers clues as to how the solar system formed.

=== Polarized light ===

In 1812, Biot turned his attention to the study of optics, particularly the polarization of light. Prior to the 19th century, light was believed to consist of discrete packets called . During the early 19th century, many scientists began to disregard the corpuscular theory in favor of the wave theory of light. Biot began his work on polarization to show that the results he was obtaining could appear only if light were made of corpuscles.

In 1815 he demonstrated that &quot;polarized light, when passing through an organic substance, could be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise, dependent upon the optical axis of the material.&quot; His work in chromatic polarization and rotary polarization greatly advanced the field of optics, although it was later shown that his findings could also be obtained using the wave theory of light.

Biot&#x27;s work on the polarization of light has led to many breakthroughs in the field of optics. Liquid crystal displays (LCDs), such as television and computer screens, use light that is polarized by a filter as it enters the liquid crystal, to allow the liquid crystal to modulate the intensity of the transmitted light. This happens as the liquid crystal&#x27;s polarisation varies in response to an electric control signal applied across it. Polarizing filters are used extensively in photography to cut out unwanted reflections or to enhance reflection.

=== Cream of Tartar ===
Potassium bitartrate was first discovered inside a wine container in Iran. The modern application of the substance began in 1768, and in 1832, Jean Baptiste Biot discovered the physical properties of cream of tartar. The item gained most of its popularity when the French began using it frequently in their cooking.

=== Arc measurement ===
In August 1806, he was commissioned by the Bureau des Longitudes, together with François Arago, to continue the measurement of a meridian arc in France and Spain begun by Delambre and Méchain (the meridian arc of Delambre and Méchain).

<doc id="75110" wikidata="Q171340" url="?curid=75110" title="Biot–Savart law">
<text>In physics, specifically electromagnetism, the Biot–Savart law ( or ) is an equation describing the magnetic field generated by a constant electric current. It relates the magnetic field to the magnitude, direction, length, and proximity of the electric current. 

The Biot–Savart law is fundamental to magnetostatics. It is valid in the magnetostatic approximation and consistent with both Ampère&#x27;s circuital law and Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism. When magnetostatics does not apply, the Biot–Savart law should be replaced by Jefimenko&#x27;s equations. The law is named after Jean-Baptiste Biot and Félix Savart, who discovered this relationship in 1820.

==Equation==
In the following equations, it is assumed that the medium is not magnetic (e.g., vacuum). This allows for straightforward derivation of magnetic field B, while the fundamental vector here is H.

===Electric currents (along a closed curve/wire)===

The Biot–Savart law is used for computing the resultant magnetic flux density B at position r in 3D-space generated by a filamentary current &quot;I&quot; (for example due to a wire). A steady (or stationary) current is a continual flow of charges which does not change with time and the charge neither accumulates nor depletes at any point. The law is a physical example of a line integral, being evaluated over the path &quot;C&quot; in which the electric currents flow (e.g. the wire). The equation in SI units teslas (T) is

\right) &amp;= -4\pi \delta(\mathbf r - \boldsymbol{\ell})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
(where is the Dirac delta function), using the fact that the divergence of J is zero (due to the assumption of magnetostatics), and performing an integration by parts, the result turns out to be
formula_1
i.e. Ampère&#x27;s circuital law. (Due to the assumption of magnetostatics, formula_2, so there is no extra displacement current term in Ampère&#x27;s law.)

In a &quot;non&quot;-magnetostatic situation, the Biot–Savart law ceases to be true (it is superseded by Jefimenko&#x27;s equations), while Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism and the Maxwell–Ampère law are still true.

==Theoretical background==
Initially, the Biot–Savart law was discovered experimentally, then this law was derived in different ways theoretically. In The Feynman Lectures on Physics, at first, the similarity of expressions for the electric potential outside the static distribution of charges and the magnetic vector potential outside the system of continuously distributed currents is emphasized, and then the magnetic field is calculated through the curl from the vector potential. Another approach involves a general solution of the inhomogeneous wave equation for the vector potential in the case of constant currents. The magnetic field can also be calculated as a consequence of the Lorentz transformations for the electromagnetic force acting from one charged particle on another particle. Two other ways of deriving the Biot–Savart law include: 1) Lorentz transformation of the electromagnetic tensor components from a moving frame of reference, where there is only an electric field of some distribution of charges, into a stationary frame of reference, in which these charges move. 2) the use of the method of retarded potentials.

<text>Taylor County is a county located in the Big Bend region in the northern part of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 21,796. Its county seat is Perry. The county hosts the annual Florida Forest Festival and has been long known as the &quot;Tree Capital of the South&quot; since a 1965 designation from then-Governor W. Haydon Burns.

==History==
Taylor County was created on December 23, 1856, from Madison County on the same day as Lafayette County was also split off from Madison County. It was named for Zachary Taylor, twelfth president of the United States, who served from 1849 to 1850. Taylor won most counties in northern Florida during the election of 1848 and was largely responsible for the ultimate U.S. victory in the Second Seminole War.

During the American Civil War, Taylor County was home to William Strickland and his band of deserters and Unionists called &quot;The Royal Rangers&quot; or the &quot;Independent Rangers&quot;. In 1864, a Confederate colonel tasked with hunting down deserters, broke into Strickland&#x27;s home and found a membership list of 35 men who &quot;bear true allegiance to the United States of America.&quot; Despite their names being identified and homes burned to the ground, few members of the Rangers surrendered.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (15.3%) is water.

<text>Union County is a county located in the north central portion of the U.S. state of Florida, the smallest in the state by area. As of the 2020 census, the population was 16,147. The county seat is Lake Butler.

==History==
Union County was created in 1921 from part of Bradford County. It was named to honor the concept of unity. Union County is the location of Union Correctional Institution and the Reception and Medical Center (RMC). Union CI is a maximum security prison and is home to part of Florida&#x27;s Death Row. The death chamber is located at nearby Florida State Prison (FSP) in Bradford County. Florida State Prison also houses some death-row inmates.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of , of which is land and (2.5%) is water. It is the smallest county by area in Florida.

* Columbia County (west)

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 16,147 people, 4,008 households, and 2,873 families residing in the county.

At the 2000 census, there were 13,442 people, 3,367 households and 2,606 families residing in the county. The population density was 56 per square mile (22/km2). There were 3,736 housing units at an average density of 16 per square mile (6/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 73.62% White, 22.84% Black or African American, 0.66% Native American, 0.31% Asian, 0.02% Pacific Islander, 1.04% from other races, and 1.50% from two or more races. 3.55% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

Of the 3,367 households, 41.80% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 57.70% were married couples living together, 15.00% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.60% were non-families. 19.50% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.10% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.76 and the average family size was 3.13.

For every 100 females there were 183.00 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 215.20 males.

<doc id="75113" wikidata="Q494541" url="?curid=75113" title="Volusia County, Florida">
<text>Volusia County (, ) is a county located in the east-central part of the U.S. state of Florida between the St. Johns River and the Atlantic Ocean. As of the 2020 census, the county was home to 553,543 people, an increase of 11.9% from the 2010 census. It was founded on December 29, 1854, from part of Orange County, and was named for the community of Volusia, located in northwestern Volusia County. Its first county seat was Enterprise. Since 1887, its county seat has been DeLand. Volusia County is part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach metropolitan statistical area, as well as part of the larger Orlando–Deltona–Daytona Beach Combined statistical area.

== Etymology ==
The origins of the word &quot;Volusia&quot; are unclear, though several theories exist:
# The name came from a word meaning &quot;Land of the Euchee&quot;, from the Euchee Indians who migrated into the area after the Timucua Indian cultures declined in the early 1700s. The Euchees (or Uchees) lived in the area of Spring Gardens, about 10 miles south of Volusia.
# It was named after a British settler named Voluz, who owned a plantation located on the St. Johns River in the late 1700s.
# The name originated from the Veluche, the surname of a French or Belgian owner of the trading post in Volusia. According to some, this was during the British regime, and according to others, it was around 1818. Over time, the name Veluche became anglicized to Volusia.
# The town was established by and named for Jere Volusia.
# The settlement was named by the Spanish after the celebrated Roman jurist Lucius Volusius Maecianus, who wrote 30 books and tutored Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor and philosopher.

==History==
Volusia County was named after its largest community, Volusia, when the Florida Legislature created it by dividing Orange County on December 29, 1854. At the time, Volusia County had about 600 residents.

The land area of present-day Volusia County was long inhabited by the indigenous Timucua and Mayaca peoples. Neither historic group exists today as distinct ethnic tribes, having been decimated by disease and war in the decades after contact with European traders and settlers. The large shell middens at Tomoka State Park and other evidence of their historic habitation can still be seen in various areas of Volusia County.

During the British occupation of Florida, a colony known as New Smyrna was started in southeast Volusia County by Andrew Turnbull. This colony was connected to St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, via the Kings Road. After the failure of the colony the settlers, many of whom were ethnic Menorcan and Greek, traveled the to move to St. Augustine.

The Seminole Indians, descendants of the Creek tribe of Alabama and Georgia who resisted forced relocation to Indian Territory, also camped in various parts of Volusia County. During the Second Seminole War (1836–1842), the Seminole burned a large sugar plantation in what is today the city of Daytona Beach.

On the east shore of the St. Johns River in Volusia, in present-day DeBary, General Winfield Scott established a fort/depot in 1836 named Fort Florida.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (23.1%) are covered by water.

Volusia County is bordered on the west by the St. Johns River and Lake Monroe, and by the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Roughly the size of Rhode Island, Volusia is situated northeast of Orlando, north of the Kennedy Space Center, and south of Jacksonville.

===Regions===
The Volusia County government divides the county into three regions. This parallels the three calling regions used by BellSouth, the regional phone company:

*East Volusia, also known as the greater Daytona Beach area, or the Halifax area (named for the Halifax River that runs through the area), includes the cities of Daytona Beach, Daytona Beach Shores, Holly Hill, Ormond Beach, Ponce Inlet, Port Orange, and South Daytona; and the surrounding unincorporated areas close to these cities.
*Southeast Volusia, also known as the greater New Smyrna Beach area, includes the cities of New Smyrna Beach, Edgewater, and Oak Hill; also the unincorporated areas close to these cities.
*West Volusia, also called St. Johns River country (named for the St. Johns River, which lies nearby), includes the cities of Barberville, DeBary, DeLand, DeLeon Springs, Deltona, Glenwood, Enterprise, Lake Helen, Orange City, Pierson, and Seville, and the surrounding unincorporated areas close to these cities. Deltona is the largest city in Volusia County.

==Politics==
Until 1952, Volusia County was reliably Democratic, with Republicans only winning it once in 1928. From 1952 to 1988, Democrats only carried the county twice, in 1964 and 1976. Democrats then gained ground again by winning the county five times in a row before the county shifted to the right from 2012 onwards.












==Law and government==
Under Volusia County&#x27;s council-manager form of government, voters elect a county council, which consists of seven members who serve four-year terms. Five are elected by district; the county chairman and at-large representative are elected county-wide.

The county council establishes ordinances and policies for the county. It also reviews and approves the county budget annually. The county council appoints a county manager, who carries out the will of the council and handles day-to-day business.

===Elected officials===
County commissioners:

* County chair: Jeff Brower
* Councilman-at-large: Jake Johansson
* District 1 council member - Don Dempsey
* District 2 council member - Matt Reinhart
* District 3 council member - Danny Robins

* Daytona Beach Administration Building, 250 N. Beach St., Daytona Beach 32114
* New Smyrna Beach Administration Office, 111 Canal St., New Smyrna Beach 32168
* Orange City Administration Office, 2744 Enterprise Rd., Orange City 32763

===Justice===
The county&#x27;s courts operate from facilities in both DeLand and Daytona Beach. There, they preside over a variety of cases, including felonies, misdemeanors, traffic, and domestic cases in their dockets. An elected prosecutor tries cases for the public. Defendants may find representation through the office of the elected public defender.

The power of electing the county&#x27;s sheriff lies with the county&#x27;s residents. The county sheriff is directly responsible to the courts, but also to the state for the enforcement of state laws. The county sheriff&#x27;s deputies provide law enforcement to the unincorporated areas of Volusia County, and assist the various municipal police departments, such as the Daytona Beach Police Department.

Many volunteers work alongside the paid professionals. Included are Citizen Observer Program (COP), who are volunteers working under the direction of the county sheriff and play a part in the county&#x27;s policing operations.

The Volusia County Correctional Center and the Volusia County Branch Jail are both located on U.S. Highway 92, also known as International Speedway Boulevard, which is roughly equidistant between DeLand and Daytona Beach. The county&#x27;s jail imprisons inmates awaiting trial, convicted offenders who have yet to be sentenced, or those who have been sentenced for a term of a year or less. Longer sentences may be served in the Florida state prison system or alternatively in the federal prison system according to the dictates of the offense.

===Libraries===
The county centrally controls 14 libraries, with DeLand and Daytona Beach-City Island being the largest two. Each library branch is administered by geographic region.

Collections included 869,491 books, 83,943 videos, 58,784 audio materials, 2,051 magazines and newspapers, over 100,000 government documents, and 51 licensed databases. Personal computers for public use are hooked up on broadband in all libraries. An estimated 230,000 Volusia County residents have library cards. One library card is valid at all locations, and materials are lent between locations through a daily courier service and outside the libraries by interlibrary loan. Library cards are free for all Volusia County residents.

Depending on size, the branches have different operating hours; six are open every day of the week (Ormond Beach, Daytona Beach-City Island, Port Orange, New Smyrna Beach, DeLand, and Deltona), three are open six days a week (Edgewater, Hope Place, and DeBary), and five are open five days a week (Daytona Beach-Keech Street, Oak Hill, Pierson, Lake Helen, and Orange City).

The Volusia County Library System was officially started in 1961. Prior to 1961, there were small libraries throughout Volusia County that were maintained by different organizations prevalent in the county. In 1949, Charlotte Smith started an effort to organize the public library system within Volusia County. In 1960, 10 libraries existed in Volusia County, however they were not connected together in a centralized library system. In September 1960, state officials met with librarians and county officials to discuss how the Library Services Act could be applied to Volusia County. A committee was formed to study the conditions of the libraries within the county and determine if organizing the libraries in the county into a centralized system was an appropriate move. After a year the committee found that a countywide library system would be the best course of action for the county. With the development of the Volusia County Library System, a library board was appointed by the governor and the board hired Bradley Simon to be the first director of the Volusia County Library System. During this time, bookmobiles were purchased and sent to rural areas in Volusia County to provide residents there with library services. By 1962, nine public libraries and the bookmobiles were part of the Volusia County Library System, and within the next four years Holly Hill, Ormond Beach, and Orange City joined the system. As new funds were made available, new construction of library facilities occurred, with many of the libraries in the Volusia County Library System being granted new buildings. In 1976 the Deltona Library opened and became the only library that the county fully owned. In 1977 the Dickerson Community Center Library opened and served the black community of Daytona Beach, and is now the John H. Dickerson Heritage Library. Expansion in the 1980s included the construction of buildings for the Port Orange Regional Library in 1984, the Lake Helen Public Library and the Edgewater Public Library in 1988, and the DeLand Regional Library in 1989.

===Voter registration===
According to the secretary of state&#x27;s office, Republicans are a plurality of registered voters in Volusia County.

==Economy==
The overall gross metro product (GMP) for Volusia County economy increased from $12.98 billion in 2005 to $13.69 billion in 2006; a $709.9 million increase. The GMP is an annual measurement of the total economic output and sales of goods and services provided within the metropolitan statistical area that comprises all of Volusia County and its 16 cities. A GMP of $13.69 billion represents a significant circulation of new capital resources in an economy populated by just over 500,000 residents.

Local consumer confidence and a continued immigration of an estimated 28,800 new residents, new capital investments for new construction exceeding $1.11 billion, and the steady growth of professional and health-care services continued to drive much of the county&#x27;s economic viability.

Volusia County&#x27;s manufacturing sector maintained a steady and stable position within the local economy contrary to the declining trends being experienced elsewhere within Florida. The overall number of manufacturers present within the county increased to over 430 in 2006 and accounted for a large portion of the county&#x27;s GMP. Manufacturing maintains one of the highest of all average wage levels within the county and generates a higher rate of circulation of economic impact than any other business sector that comprises the local economy.

Volusia County&#x27;s manufacturing sector generated an average annual wage of $37,632 in 2006, well above the county&#x27;s average annual wage of $32,200 for all workers.

<text>Timothy Eaton (March 1834 – 31 January 1907) was a Northern Irish-Canadian businessman who founded the Eaton&#x27;s department store, one of the most important retail businesses in Canada&#x27;s history.

==Early life and family==
He was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, Ireland (now Northern Ireland). His parents were Scottish Protestants, John Eaton and Margaret Craig. As a 20-year-old Irish apprentice shopkeeper, Timothy Eaton sailed from Ireland to settle with other family members in southern Ontario, Canada. On 28 May 1862, Eaton married Margaret Wilson Beattie. They had five sons and three daughters. Among the sons were John Craig Eaton and Edward Young Eaton. One of the daughters, Josephine Smyth Eaton, survived the sinking of RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; off the Irish coast in 1915. His granddaughter, Iris Burnside, was lost in that sinking.

==T. Eaton Co. Limited==
In 1854, he worked for a short time in a haberdashery store in Glen Williams, Ontario. His sister married William Reid; they owned a farm in Georgetown, Ontario, a short distance from Glen Williams. In 1865, with the help of his brothers, Robert and James, Timothy Eaton set up a bakery business in the town of Kirkton, Ontario, which went under after only a few months. Undaunted, he opened a dry goods store in St. Marys, Ontario.

In 1869, Eaton purchased an existing dry-goods and haberdashery business at 178 Yonge Street in Toronto. In promoting his new business, Eaton embraced two retail practices that were ground-breaking at the time: first, all goods had one price (no haggling) with no credit given, and second, all purchases came with a money-back guarantee (a practice expressed in what would become the long-standing store slogan of &quot;Goods Satisfactory or Money Refunded&quot;).

Starting in 1884, Eaton introduced Canada to the wonders of the mail-order catalogue, reaching thousands of small towns and rural communities with an array of products previously unattainable. In these tiny communities, the arrival of Eaton&#x27;s catalogue was a major event. More than clothing, furniture, or the latest in kitchen gadgetry, the catalogue offered such practical items as milking machines, in addition to just about every other contraption or new invention desirable. And, when rendered obsolete by the new season&#x27;s catalogue, it served another important use in the outdoor privy of most every rural home.

Eaton spawned a colossal retail empire that his offspring would expand coast to coast, reaching its high point during World War II, when the T. Eaton Co. Limited employed more than 70,000 people. Although Eaton did not invent the department store, nor was he the first retailer in the world to implement a money-back guarantee, the chain he founded popularized both concepts and revolutionized retailing in Canada.

==Death and legacy==

Eaton died of pneumonia on 31 January 1907, and is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto. He was succeeded by his son, John Craig Eaton.

In 1919, two life-sized statues of Timothy Eaton were donated by the Eaton&#x27;s employees to the Toronto and Winnipeg stores in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the company. For years, it was tradition for customers in both Toronto and Winnipeg to rub the toe of the statue for good luck. The Toronto statue is now housed by the Royal Ontario Museum, and the Winnipeg statue sits in the city&#x27;s arena, Canada Life Centre (formerly MTS Centre and Bell MTS Place), in almost exactly the same spot where it stood in the now demolished Eaton&#x27;s store (albeit one storey higher). Museum-goers in Toronto and hockey fans in Winnipeg continue to rub Timothy Eaton&#x27;s toe for luck.

His grandson was flying ace Henry John Burden. In 1985, his great-great-granddaughter, Nancy Eaton, was murdered by a childhood friend, who was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Timothy Eaton Memorial Church, in Toronto, was erected in 1914.

The town of Eatonia, Saskatchewan was named after Timothy Eaton.

The ground of Ballymena RFC, originally the sports grounds of the Mid-Antrim Sports Association, is called Eaton Park.

A school in the Scarborough district of Toronto, Timothy Eaton Business and Technical Institute, was named after him. It opened in 1971 for classes and closed its doors permanently in 2009.

==In popular culture==

Brian Rhodes portrays Eaton in &quot;Invention Convention&quot; (July 31, 2012), episode 9 of season 5 of the Canadian television period drama Murdoch Mysteries.

<text>Wakulla County is a county located in the Big Bend region in the northern portion of the U.S. state of Florida. As of the 2020 census, the population was 33,764. Its county seat is Crawfordville. Wakulla County is part of the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. Wakulla County has a near-absence of any municipal population, with two small municipalities holding about 3% of the population. The county seat, Crawfordville, is one of only two unincorporated county seats among Florida&#x27;s 67 counties.

== History ==

=== First Spanish period ===
In 1528, Pánfilo de Narváez found his way to what would be Wakulla County from the future Pinellas County, Florida, camping at the confluence of the Wakulla and St. Marks rivers. Narváez determined this was a very suitable spot for a fort. In 1539, Hernando de Soto&#x27;s expedition passed through &quot;La Florida&quot; with a similar route.

The Fort San Marcos de Apalache began with a wooden fort in the late 1600s. The vicinity around the fort was not settled until 1733. Spanish colonial officials began constructing a stone fort, which was unfinished in the mid-1760s when Great Britain took over.

=== British period ===
The British divided Florida into East Florida, which included present-day Wakulla County, and West Florida. The boundary was the Apalachicola River; at that time, West Florida extended all the way to the Mississippi River. Twenty years later when the Spanish returned, they kept the East and West divisions, with the administrative capitals remaining at St. Augustine and Pensacola, respectively.

===Second Spanish period===
The area to become Wakulla County was an active place in the early 19th century. A former British officer named William Augustus Bowles attempted to unify and lead 400 Creek Indians against the Spanish outpost of San Marcos, capturing it. This provoked Spain, and a Spanish flotilla arrived some five weeks later to restore control.

In 1818, General Andrew Jackson invaded the area, capturing Fort San Marcos. Two captive British citizens, Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, were tried, found guilty of inciting Indian raids, and executed under Jackson&#x27;s authority – causing a diplomatic nightmare between the U.S. and Britain. The U.S. Army garrison of 200 infantry and artillery men occupied the fort for the better part of a year (1818–1819).

In 1821, Florida was ceded to the United States and Fort St. Marks, as the Americans called it, was again garrisoned by U.S. troops.

=== Florida&#x27;s territorial period ===
In 1824, the fort was abandoned and turned over to the Territory of Florida.

By 1839, the fort was returned to the Federal government and a merchant marine hospital was built. The hospital provided care for seamen and area yellow fever victims.

==== American forts in Wakulla County ====
* 1840 - Camp Lawson, northwest of Wakulla and northeast of Ivan, on the St. Marks River. A log stockade also known as Fort Lawson (2).
* 1841-1842 - Fort Many located near Wakulla Springs.
* 1839 - Fort Number Five (M) located near Sopchoppy.
* 1839-1843 - Fort Stansbury was located on the Wakulla River from St. Marks.
* 1841-1843 - Fort Port Leon. Abandoned after a hurricane destroyed it. Site was later used for a CSA Army artillery battery.
* 1839 - James Island Post located on James Island.

=== Antebellum Wakulla ===
Wakulla County was created from Leon County in 1843. It may (although this is disputed) be named for the Timucuan Indian word for &quot;spring of water&quot; or &quot;mysterious water&quot;. This is in reference to Wakulla County&#x27;s greatest natural attraction, Wakulla Springs, which is one of the world&#x27;s largest freshwater springs, both in terms of depth and water flow. In 1974, the water flow was measured at per day—the greatest recorded flow ever for a single spring.

In an 1856 book, adventurer Charles Lanman wrote of the springs:

Another possible origin for the name Wakulla, not as widely accepted, is that it means &quot;mist&quot; or &quot;misting&quot;, perhaps in reference to the Wakulla Volcano, a 19th-century phenomenon in which a column of smoke could be seen emerging from the swamp for miles.

The town of Port Leon was once a thriving cotton-shipping hub, with a railroad from Tallahassee that carried over 50,000 tons of cotton a year to be put on ships, usually for shipment direct to Europe. Port Leon was the sixth-largest town in Florida, with 1,500 residents. However, a hurricane and the accompanying storm surge wiped out the entire town. New Port (today known as Newport, Florida) was built two miles (3 km) upstream but never quite achieved the prosperity of Port Leon.

=== Civil War ===
During the Civil War, Wakulla County was blockaded from 1861 to 1865 by a Union Navy squadron at the mouth of the St. Marks River. Confederates took the old Spanish fort known as San Marcos de Apalache, or Fort St. Marks, and renamed it Fort Ward.

The Battle of Natural Bridge eventually stopped the Union force that intended to take Fort Ward and nearby Tallahassee, the only Confederate state capital other than Austin Texas which had not been captured. The Union was not able to land all of its forces, but they still outnumbered the Confederates, who chose to make their stand at a place where the St. Marks River goes underground: the &quot;Natural Bridge&quot; referred to. However, the Confederate Army had over a day to prepare its defenses, and the Union Army retreated. Most of the dead were African-American Union soldiers.

=== 20th century and beyond ===
In Gloria Jahoda&#x27;s book &quot;The Other Florida&quot;, she writes movingly of the extreme poverty of Wakulla County from the early 1900s to 1966 when Wakulla still had no doctor and no dentist, few stores, and a county newspaper produced just once a month on a mimeograph machine.

Today, Wakulla has several doctors and dentists, several supermarkets and big-box retailers, a golf resort, and a thriving seafood business.

== Etymology ==
The name Wakulla is corrupted from Guacara. Guacara is a Spanish phonetic spelling of an original Indian name, and Wakulla is a Muskhogean pronunciation of Guacara. The Spanish &quot;Gua&quot; is the equivalent of the Creek &quot;wa&quot;, and as the Creek alphabet does not exhibit an &quot;R&quot; sound, the second element &quot;cara&quot; would have been pronounced &quot;kala&quot; by the Creeks. The Creek voiceless &quot;L&quot; is always substituted for the Spanish &quot;R&quot;. Thus the word Guacara was pronounced Wakala by the Seminoles who are Muskhogean in their origin and language.

Because Wakulla was probably a Timucuan word, it is unlikely that its meaning will ever be known. It may contain the word kala, which signified a &quot;spring of water&quot; in some Indian dialects.. It may refer to the Whip-poor-will, known as waxkula in Creek.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (17.6%) is water. 

Wakulla County was added to the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in 1973. The county was removed from the Tallahassee MSA in 1983. It was re-added to the MSA (for the second time) in 2003.

No railroads currently operate within Wakulla County, but it was formerly served by two different railroads.

The Georgia, Florida and Alabama Railroad, completed in 1893, passed through Sopchoppy on its route between Tallahassee and Carrabelle until its abandonment in 1948. South of Sopchoppy, the line followed H.T. Smith Road. The railroad bridge crossing the Ochlocknee River at MacIntyre still exists as pilings blocking all but a portion of the river on the south side. 

The Tallahassee Railroad, the first railroad in Florida, was completed in 1836 and was abandoned by its successor, the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, in 1983. of that right-of-way became the Tallahassee-St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail in 1988.

<text>Walton County is a county located on the Emerald Coast in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida, with its southern border on the Gulf of Mexico. As of the 2020 census, the population was 75,305. Its county seat is DeFuniak Springs. The county is home to the highest natural point in Florida: Britton Hill, at . Walton County is included in the Crestview–Fort Walton Beach–Destin Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Walton County was organized by European Americans in 1824. It was named for Colonel George Walton Jr., secretary of the Florida Territory from 1821 to 1826. Walton, the son of George Walton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was born August 15, 1786, in Augusta, Georgia, and died March 20, 1859, in Petersburg, Virginia.

Between 1763 and 1783 the territory that has since become Walton County was part of the colony of British West Florida. During this time British settlers permanently settled in the area, becoming the first English-speaking people to permanently reside in what is now Walton County. During this period Scottish settlers migrated from the backcountry of the Carolinas and settled in the Defuniak Springs area while English settlers, most of whom were either farmers or fishermen, settled in the southern portion of the county by the sea, settling throughout the area that has since become Santa Rosa Beach, Sandestin, Miramar Beach, Point Washington, Seaside and Topsail Hill Preserve State Park and Point Washington State Forest.

While the Scottish settlers had come from a recently established Scottish-majority settlement in North Carolina, the English settlers came largely from the English regions of Norfolk, Dorset and the western half of Sussex. Both the Scots village in the northern portion of the county and the English community along the coast were largely self-contained and had economies that were entirely operational without external trade, as all products in use were made within the two respective communities, and the only external trade was between the Scots in Defuniak Springs and the English farmers/fishermen by the coast. Neither community exported the goods they produced for profit, nor did they have any imported goods at all as both communities relied on self-produced subsistence agriculture. The original settlements were in the Euchee (Yuchi) Valley, near the landing on the Choctawhatchee River that was maintained by a mixed-race Yuchi named Sam Story, whose mother was Yuchi and father was an early Scots trader in the area. The white settlers founded one of the first Presbyterian churches in Northwest Florida. It is still an operating parish and has a historical cemetery.

When the Spanish regained control of Florida in 1783, roughly two-thirds of the British settlers in Pensacola left the colony to find permanent habitation elsewhere, including in the Bahamas and Bermuda, however none of the English or Scottish settlers in what has since become Walton County left with them. The Spanish came to regard the English and Scottish settlers in what has since become Walton County as &quot;stubborn&quot; and &quot;ungovernable&quot; as the Spanish were unable to make them obey Spanish law. They unanimously refused to convert to Catholicism, despite the fact that Spanish law said they were only allowed to remain in Florida if they did so and the Spanish were unable to compel them to pay taxes to the local Spanish government. As settlers from the newly created United States of America began migrating into north Florida the English and Scottish settlers in what has since become Walton County became gradually absorbed into this community, which would subsequently become the majority population in North Florida.

In 1860, there were roughly 573 military aged men in Walton County. Of that population, 62, or 11%, went to serve in the Union unit, the 1st Florida Cavalry Regiment that was mustered in on October 29, 1863. The first Confederate monument in Florida, located at the Walton County Courthouse, records the names of 94 soldiers who died fighting for the Confederacy.

In 1995, three planned communities designed by Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk of the Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company were founded. The communities, named Alys Beach, Seaside, and Rosemary Beach are examples of a style of urban planning known as New Urbanism. The final plan for Seaside was complete around 1985.

Seaside was used as the main filming location of the 1998 film &quot;The Truman Show&quot;.

<text>Washington County is a county located in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Florida, in the Panhandle. As of the 2020 census, the population was 25,318. Its county seat is Chipley. Washington County is included in the Panama City—Panama City Beach, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Washington County was created in 1825, and was nearly twice the size of the State of Delaware, stretching all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. After a century of boundary shifts, the county, with over of rolling hills covered in thick, stately pines and mixed hardwood forests, now covers a large portion of the central Florida Panhandle.

Over a span of more than 150 years, Washington County has seen Native American, Spanish and English cultural influences. The county&#x27;s historical lore is rich with stories of the exploits of Andrew Jackson. There are numerous Native American mounds and evidence of strong settlements still being discovered.

Named after George Washington, the first US president, the area was first settled by those seeking both economic and political freedom in this frontier land of vast timber and mineral resources. Inland waterway transportation brought about heavy river settlements. The arrival of railroads in the late 1800s boosted economic, social and political developments.

Vernon, the geographical center of the county, is named for George Washington&#x27;s Virginia home, Mt. Vernon. The pioneer town was also the site of a major Indian settlement.

The county courthouse was located in Vernon during the early part of this century, until a railroad town in northeastern Washington County, Chipley, became the new and present county seat in 1927.

Washington County was once a dry county, meaning that the sale of alcoholic beverages was banned in the county. In January 2022, this restriction was removed following a voter referendum in which about two-thirds of voters supported the removal.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (5.4%) is water.

<text>Charles Dillon &quot;Casey&quot; Stengel (; July 30, 1890 – September 29, 1975) was an American Major League Baseball right fielder and manager, best known as the manager of the championship New York Yankees of the 1950s and later, the expansion New York Mets. Nicknamed &quot;the Ol&#x27; Perfessor&quot;, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in .

Stengel was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1890. In 1910, he began a professional baseball career that would span over half a century. After almost three seasons in the minor leagues, Stengel reached the major leagues late in 1912, as an outfielder, for the Brooklyn Dodgers. His six seasons there saw some success, among them playing for Brooklyn&#x27;s 1916 National League championship team, but he also developed a reputation as a clown. After repeated clashes over pay with the Dodgers owner, Charlie Ebbets, Stengel was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1918; however, he enlisted in the Navy that summer, for the remainder of World War I. After returning to baseball, he continued his pay disputes, resulting in trades to the Philadelphia Phillies (in 1919) and to the New York Giants (in 1921). There, he learned much about baseball from the manager, John McGraw, and had a number of highlights in his career, including hitting an inside-the-park home run in Game 1 of the 1923 World Series to defeat the Yankees. His major league playing career ended with the Boston Braves in 1925, but he then began a career as a manager.

The first twenty years of Stengel&#x27;s second career brought mostly poor finishes, especially during his MLB managerial stints with the Dodgers (1934–1936) and Braves (1938–1943). He thereafter enjoyed some success on the minor league level, and Yankee general manager George Weiss hired him as manager in October 1948. Stengel&#x27;s Yankees won the World Series five consecutive times (1949–1953), the only time that has been achieved. Although the team won ten pennants in his twelve seasons, and won seven World Series, his final two years brought less success, with a third-place finish in 1959, and a loss in the 1960 World Series. By then aged 70, he was dismissed by the Yankees shortly after the defeat.

Stengel had become well known for his humorous and sometimes disjointed way of speech during his time with the Yankees, and these skills of showmanship served the expansion Mets well when they hired him in late 1961. He promoted the team tirelessly, as well as managing it to a 40–120 win–loss record, the most losses of any 20th century MLB team. The team finished last all four years he managed it, but was boosted by considerable support from fans. Stengel retired in 1965, and became a fixture at baseball events for the rest of his life. Although Stengel is sometimes described as one of the great managers in major league history, others have contrasted his success during the Yankee years with his lack of success at other times, and concluded he was a good manager only when given good players. Stengel is remembered as one of the great characters in baseball history.

==Early life==
Charles Dillon Stengel was born on July 30, 1890, in Kansas City, Missouri. His ancestry included German and Irish; his parents—Louis Stengel and Jennie (Jordan) Stengel—were from the Quad Cities area of Illinois and Iowa, and had moved to Kansas City soon after their 1886 wedding so Louis could take an insurance job. &quot;Charlie&quot; was the youngest of three children, and the second son. Charlie Stengel played sandlot baseball as a child, and also played baseball, football and basketball at Kansas City&#x27;s Central High School. His basketball team won the city championship, while the baseball team won the state championship.

As a teenager, Stengel played on a number of semipro baseball teams. He played on the traveling team called the Kansas City Red Sox during the summers of 1908 and 1909, going as far west as Wyoming and earning a dollar a day. He was offered a contract by the minor league Kansas City Blues for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, &quot;So I put down my paper and signed. You could never change that boy&#x27;s mind anyway&quot;.

==Playing career==

===Minor leagues===
Before reporting to spring training for the Blues in early 1910 at Excelsior Springs, Missouri, Stengel was approached by his neighbor, Kid Nichols, a former star pitcher, who advised him to listen to his manager and to the older players, and if he was minded to reject their advice, at least think it over for a month or so first. Stengel failed to make the ball club, which was part of the American Association, considered one of the top minor leagues. Kansas City optioned Stengel to the Kankakee Kays of the Class D Northern Association, a lower-level minor league, to gain experience as an outfielder. He had a .251 batting average with Kankakee when the league folded in July. He found a place with the Shelbyville Grays, who moved mid-season and became the Maysville Rivermen, of the Class D Blue Grass League, batting .221. He returned to the Blues for the final week of the season, with his combined batting average for 1910 at .237.

Uncertain of whether he would be successful as a baseball player, Stengel attended Western Dental College in the 1910–1911 offseason. He would later tell stories of his woes as a left-handed would-be dentist using right-handed equipment. The Blues sold Stengel to the Aurora Blues of the Class C Wisconsin–Illinois League. He led the league with a .352 batting average. Brooklyn Dodgers scout Larry Sutton took a trip from Chicago to nearby Aurora, noticed Stengel, and the Dodgers purchased his contract on September 1, 1911. Brooklyn outfielder Zach Wheat later claimed credit for tipping off Sutton that Stengel was worth signing. Stengel finished the season with Aurora and returned to dental school for the offseason.

The Dodgers assigned Stengel to the Montgomery Rebels of the Class A Southern Association for the 1912 season. Playing for manager Kid Elberfeld, Stengel batted .290 and led the league in outfield assists. He also developed a reputation as an eccentric player. Scout Mike Kahoe referred to Stengel as a &quot;dandy ballplayer, but it&#x27;s all from the neck down&quot;. After reporting to Brooklyn in September and getting a taste of the big leagues, he spent a third offseason at dental school in 1912–1913. He did not graduate, though whenever his baseball career hit a bad patch in the years to follow, his wife Edna would urge him to get his degree.

===Brooklyn years (1912–1917)===
In later years, Casey Stengel told stories of his coming to Brooklyn to play for the Dodgers; most focused on his naïveté and were, at least, exaggerated. Wheat was from the Kansas City area and watched over Stengel, getting the young player a locker next to his and working with him on outfield technique. Stengel made his MLB debut at Brooklyn&#x27;s Washington Park on September 17, 1912, as the starting center fielder, and went 4–4 with a walk, two stolen bases and two tie-breaking runs batted in, leading seventh-place Brooklyn to a 7–3 win over the Pirates. Stengel continued to play well, finishing the season with a .316 batting average, though hitting .351 when right-handers started against Brooklyn and only .250 when left-handers started.

After holding out for better pay, Stengel signed with the Dodgers for 1913. He won the starting center fielder job. The Dodgers had a new ballpark, Ebbets Field, and Stengel became the first person to hit a home run there, first an inside-the-park home run against the New York Yankees in an exhibition game to open the stadium, and then in the regular season. During the 1913 season, Stengel acquired the nickname &quot;Casey&quot;; there are varying stories of how this came to be, though his home town of Kansas City likely played a prominent role—sportswriter Fred Lieb stated that the ballplayer had &quot;Charles Stengel—K.C.&quot; stenciled on his bags. Although he missed 25 games with injuries, he hit .272 with seven official home runs in his first full season as a major leaguer. Prior to 1914 spring training, Stengel coached baseball at the University of Mississippi. Though the position was unpaid, he was designated an assistant professor for the time he was there, something that may have been the source of Stengel&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Ol&#x27; Perfessor&quot;.

The Dodgers were an improving team in Stengel&#x27;s first years with them, and he was greatly influenced by the manager who joined the team in 1914, Wilbert Robinson. Stengel also avoided a holdout in 1914; Dodgers owner Charlie Ebbets was anxious to put his players under contract lest they jump to the new Federal League, and nearly doubled Stengel&#x27;s salary to $4,000 per year. During spring training, the Dodgers faced the minor league Baltimore Orioles and their rookie, Babe Ruth, who pitched. Ruth hit a triple over Stengel&#x27;s head but gave up two doubles to him, and Stengel chased down a long Ruth fly ball to right in the Dodgers&#x27; loss. Both Brooklyn and Stengel started the season slowly, but both recovered with a hot streak that left the Dodgers only 4 games under .500, their best record since 1903, and Stengel finished with a .316 batting average, fifth best in the league. His on-base percentage led the league at .404, though this was not yet an official statistic. With the Federal League still active, Stengel was rewarded with a two-year contract at $6,000 per year.

Stengel reported to spring training ill and thin; he was unable to work out for much of the time the Dodgers spent in Florida. Although the team stated that he had typhoid fever, still common in 1915, Lieb wrote after Stengel&#x27;s death in 1975 that the ballplayer had gonorrhea. Stengel may have been involved in a well-known incident during spring training when Robinson agreed to catch a baseball dropped from an airplane piloted by Ruth Law—except that it proved not to be a baseball, but a small grapefruit, much to the manager&#x27;s shock, as he assumed the liquid on him was blood. Law stated that she dropped the grapefruit as she had forgotten the baseball, but Stengel retold the story, imitating Robinson, many times in his later years, with himself as grapefruit dropper, and is often given the credit for the stunt. Stengel&#x27;s batting average dipped as low as the .150s for part of the season; though he eventually recovered to .237, this was still the worst full season percentage of his major league career.
Soon after the 1916 season started, it became clear that the Dodgers were one of the better teams in the league. Robinson managed to squeeze one more year of productivity out of some older veterans such as Chief Meyers, who said of Stengel, &quot;It was Casey who kept us on our toes. He was the life of the party and just kept all us old-timers pepped up all season.&quot; Stengel, mostly playing right field, hit .279 with eight home runs, one less than the team leader in that category, Wheat. Stengel&#x27;s home run off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, who won 33 games that year, in the second game of a doubleheader on September 30, provided the margin of victory as the Dodgers went into first place to stay, qualifying for their first World Series, against the Boston Red Sox. Despite getting two hits in a Game 1 loss at Boston, Stengel was benched for Game 2 because the Red Sox were pitching a left-hander, Babe Ruth, and Stengel hit better against right-handers. Stengel, back in the lineup for Game 3, got a hit in Brooklyn&#x27;s only victory of the series. He was benched again in Game 4 against left-hander Dutch Leonard, though he was inserted as a pinch runner, and got another hit in the Game 5 loss, finishing 4 for 11, .364, the best Dodger batting average of the Series.

Despite the successful season, Ebbets was determined to cut his players&#x27; salaries, including Stengel, whom he considered overpaid. By then, the Federal League was defunct, and the reserve clause prevented players from jumping to other major league clubs. The owner sent Stengel a contract for $4,600, and when that was rejected, cut it by another $400. A holdout ensued, together with a war of words waged in the press. With little leverage, Stengel became willing to sign for the original contract, and did on March 27, 1917, but missed most of spring training. Stengel&#x27;s batting average dropped from .279 to .257 as the defending league champion Dodgers finished seventh in the eight-team league, but he led the team in games, hits, doubles, triples, home runs and runs batted in. After the season, Ebbets sent Stengel a contract for $4,100, and the outfielder eventually signed for that amount, but on January 9, 1918, Ebbets traded him along with George Cutshaw to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Burleigh Grimes, Al Mamaux and Chuck Ward.

=== Pittsburgh and Philadelphia (1918–1921) ===
The Pirates had been the only National League team to do worse than the Dodgers in 1917, finishing last. Stengel met with the Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss to seek a salary increase, but found Dreyfuss reluctant to deal until Stengel proved himself as a Pirate. On June 3, 1918, Stengel was ejected for arguing with the umpire, and was fined by the league office for taking off his shirt on the field. The U.S. had been fighting in World War I for a year, and Stengel enlisted in the Navy. His wartime service was playing for and managing the Brooklyn Navy Yard&#x27;s baseball team, driving in the only run to beat Army, 1–0, before 5,000 spectators at the Polo Grounds. He also occasionally helped paint a ship—he later stated he had guarded the Gowanus Canal, and not a single submarine got into it.

The Armistice renewed the conflict between Stengel and Dreyfuss, and the outfielder held out again to begin the 1919 season. Both wanted to see Stengel traded, but no deal was immediately made. By then, Stengel&#x27;s position as regular right fielder had been taken by Billy Southworth, and he had difficulty breaking back into the lineup. Stengel played better than he had before he enlisted, and by the time Dreyfuss traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for Possum Whitted on August 9, he was batting .293 with four home runs. But before being traded, Stengel pulled one of his most famous stunts, on May 25 at Ebbets Field, as a member of the visiting Pirates. It was not unusual at Ebbets Field for right fielders of either team, rather than go to the dugout after three were out, to go to the Dodgers&#x27; bullpen, in foul territory down the right field line, if they were not likely to bat in the upcoming inning. Stengel did so to visit old friends, and discovered that pitcher Leon Cadore had captured a sparrow. Stengel took it, and quietly placed it under his cap when called to bat in the sixth inning. He received mixed boos and cheers from the Brooklyn crowd as a former Dodger, took a deep bow at the plate, and doffed his cap, whereupon the bird flew away to great laughter from the crowd.

The trade to the Phillies ended Stengel&#x27;s major league season for 1919, as he refused to report unless he got a raise, and when one was not forthcoming, returned to Kansas City to raise a barnstorming team. In the offseason, he came to terms with William Baker, the owner of the Phillies, and hit .292 in 1920 with nine home runs. However, racked by injuries and no longer young for a ballplayer, he did not play much in the early part of the 1921 season. On June 30, 1921, the Phillies traded Stengel, Red Causey and Johnny Rawlings to the New York Giants for Lee King, Goldie Rapp and Lance Richbourg. The Giants were one of the dominant teams in the National League, and Stengel, who had feared being sent to the minor leagues, quietly placed a long-distance call once informed to ensure he was not the victim of a practical joke.

=== New York Giants and Boston Braves (1921–1925) ===
When Stengel reported to the Giants on July 1, 1921, they were managed, as they had been for almost 20 years, by John McGraw. Stengel biographer Robert W. Creamer said of McGraw, &quot;his Giants were the most feared, the most respected, the most admired team in baseball&quot;. Stengel biographer Marty Appel noted, &quot;McGraw and Stengel. Teacher and student. Casey was about to learn a lot about managing&quot;. Stengel had time to learn, playing in only 18 games for the Giants in 1921, mostly as a pinch hitter, and watched from his place on the bench as McGraw led the Giants from a 7 game deficit on August 24 to the National League pennant. Although he was on the 25-player postseason roster, Stengel did not appear in the 1921 World Series against the Yankees, as McGraw used only 13 players (4 of them pitchers) in beating the Yankees, five games to three. The only contribution Stengel made to the box score was being ejected from Game 5 for arguing.

McGraw brought several outfielders into spring training with the Giants. When Stengel was not included with the starters when the manager split the squad, some sportswriters assumed he would not be with the team when the regular season began. Stengel, at McGraw&#x27;s request, acted as a coach to the young players on the &quot;B&quot; squad, and worked hard, getting key hits in spring training games, and making the Giants as a reserve outfielder. McGraw and Stengel sometimes stayed up all night, discussing baseball strategy. With two Giant outfielders injured by June, Stengel was put in center field, and hit .368 in 84 games, as McGraw platooned him against right-handers. If Stengel had enough plate appearances to qualify for the league batting championship, he would have finished second to Rogers Hornsby of the St. Louis Cardinals, who hit .401. The Giants played the Yankees again in the 1922 World Series; Stengel went 1–4 in Game 1, nursing an injured right leg muscle, which he aggravated running out an infield single in his first at bat in Game 2. Stengel was obviously limping when he was advanced to second base on another single, and McGraw sent in a pinch runner. He did not use Stengel again in the Series, which the Giants won, four games to zero, with one tie. After the Series, Stengel and other major leaguers went on a barnstorming tour of Japan and the Far East.
The year 1923 started much the same as the year before, with Stengel detailed to the &quot;B&quot; squad as player and coach in spring training, making the team as a reserve, and then inserted as center fielder when righties pitched. Similar also were Stengel&#x27;s hot batting streaks, helping the Giants as they contended for their third straight pennant. Stengel was ejected several times for brawling or arguing with the umpire, and the league suspended him for ten games in one incident. McGraw continued to use him as a means of exerting some control over the younger players. During that summer, Stengel fell in love with Edna Lawson, a Californian who was running part of her father&#x27;s building contracting business; they were married the following year. Near the end of the season, he sustained a mild foot injury, causing McGraw to rest him for a week, but he played the final two games of the regular season to finish at .339 as the Giants and Yankees each won their leagues.

Until 1923, the Yankees had been tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds, but had opened Yankee Stadium that year, and this was the site for Game 1 of the 1923 World Series on October 10. Casey Stengel&#x27;s at bat in the ninth inning with the score tied 4–4 was &quot;the stuff of legend&quot;, as Appel put it in his history of the Yankees. Before the largest crowd he had ever played before, Stengel lined a changeup from Joe Bush for a hit that went between the outfielders deep to left center. Hobbled by his injury and even more as a sponge inside his shoe flew out as he rounded second base, Stengel slowly circled the bases, and evaded the tag from catcher Wally Schang for an inside-the-park home run, providing the winning margin. Thus, the first World Series home run in old Yankee Stadium&#x27;s history did not go to Babe Ruth, &quot;that honor, with great irony, would fall to the aging reserve outfielder Casey Stengel&quot;.

After the Yankees won Game 2 at the Polo Grounds, the Series returned to Yankee Stadium for Game 3. Stengel won it, 1–0, on a home run into the right field bleachers. As the Yankee fans booed Stengel, he thumbed his nose at the crowd and blew a kiss toward the Yankee players, outraging the team&#x27;s principal owner, Jacob Ruppert, who demanded that Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis fine or suspend Stengel. Judge Landis declined, saying &quot;a man who wins two games with home runs may feel a little playful, especially if he&#x27;s a Stengel&quot;. The Yankees won the next three games to take the Series; Stengel batted .417 in the six games, completing his World Series career as a player with a .393 batting average.

On November 13, 1923, twenty-nine days after the World Series ended, Stengel was traded to the perennial second-division-dwelling Boston Braves with Dave Bancroft and Bill Cunningham for Joe Oeschger and Billy Southworth. Stengel had enjoyed his time in New York and was initially unhappy at the trade, especially since he had become close to McGraw. He soon cooled down, and later praised McGraw as &quot;the greatest manager I ever played for&quot;. Despite nagging pains in his legs, Stengel played in 134 games during the 1924 season, the most since his days with the Dodgers, and hit .280 with a team-leading 13 stolen bases, but the Braves finished last. After the season, Stengel joined a baseball tour of Europe organized by McGraw and Charles Comiskey, with Edna Stengel accompanying the team. Casey Stengel met King George V and the Duke of York, later to become King George VI; Edna sipped tea with Queen Mary, an experience that strained her nerves. That winter, the Stengels moved into a house built by Edna&#x27;s father in Glendale, California, where they would live the rest of their lives. The marriage produced no children.

==Early managerial career (1925–1948)==
=== Minor leagues (1925–1931) ===
Stengel started 1925 on the active roster of the Braves, but was used as a pinch hitter and started only once, in right field against the Pirates on May 14, a game in which he got his only MLB hit of 1925, the final one of his major league career, a single. His average sank to .077. Braves owner Emil Fuchs purchased the Worcester Panthers of the Eastern League, and hired Stengel as player-manager and team president. Appel noted that in joining the Panthers, Stengel was &quot;starting out on a managing career that would eventually take him to Cooperstown&quot;. With fans enjoying Stengel&#x27;s on-field antics and his World Series heroics still recent, he was the Eastern League&#x27;s biggest attendance draw. Between run-ins with the umpires, Stengel hit .302 in 100 games as the Panthers finished third.

The Panthers were not a box office success, and Fuchs planned to move the team to Providence, Rhode Island for the 1926 season, with Stengel to remain in his roles. McGraw, with whom Stengel had remained close, wanted him to take over as manager of the Giants&#x27; top affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association, at an increase in salary. Stengel was still under contract to the Braves, and Mud Hens president Joseph O&#x27;Brien was unwilling to send them money or players in order to get him. When Stengel asked Fuchs what to do if a higher-level club wanted to draft him, Fuchs half-heartedly suggested releasing himself as a player, which would automatically terminate his Braves contract. Stengel took up Fuchs on his suggestion, releasing himself as a player, then firing himself as manager and resigning as president, clearing the way for him to move to the Mud Hens. Fuchs was outraged, and went to Judge Landis, who advised him to let the matter go.

Stengel&#x27;s six years in Toledo would be as long as he would spend anywhere as manager, except his time with the Yankees of the 1950s. McGraw sent talented players down to Toledo, and the Mud Hens threatened for the pennant in Stengel&#x27;s first year before falling back to third. In 1927, the team won its first pennant and defeated the Buffalo Bisons, five games to one, in the Little World Series. Stengel missed part of the 1927 campaign, as he was suspended by the league for inciting the fans to attack the umpire after a close play during the first game of the Labor Day doubleheader. Stengel continued as an occasional player as late as 1931 in addition to his managerial role, hitting a game-winning home run (the last of his professional career) in 1927 for the Mud Hens. Since minor league clubs suffer large turnovers in their rosters, the team&#x27;s success did not carry over to 1928, when it finished sixth, and then eighth in the eight-team league in 1929. The team recovered for third in 1930, but by then both Stengel and the team (in which he had invested) were having financial problems due to the start of the Great Depression. The team finished last again in 1931, and, after Landis was convinced no money had been skimmed off to benefit Stengel and other insiders, the team went into receivership, and Stengel was fired.

=== Brooklyn and Boston (1932–1943) ===

Stengel had approached the new manager of the Dodgers, Max Carey, an old teammate from his time with the Pirates, seeking a job, and was hired as first base coach. Stengel thus ended an exile of seven years from the major leagues: Appel suggested that Stengel&#x27;s reputation as a clown inhibited owners from hiring him although he was known as knowledgeable and able to manage the press. Sportswriter Dan Daniel described Stengel&#x27;s hiring as &quot;the return of an ancient Flatbush landmark&quot;, which might satisfy old Dodger fans upset at Robinson&#x27;s dismissal at the end of 1931. Brooklyn finished third and then sixth with Stengel in the first base coaching box. Among the players was catcher Al Lopez; the two became close friends and would be managing rivals in the 1950s American League.

During the winter following the 1933 season, the manager of the world champion Giants, Bill Terry was interviewed by the press about the other teams in the National League. When asked about the Dodgers, Terry responded, &quot;Brooklyn? Gee, I haven&#x27;t heard a peep out of there. Is Brooklyn still in the league?&quot; This angered Brooklyn&#x27;s management, and they expected Carey to make a full-throated response. When he remained silent, he was fired. One sportswriter regarded the hiring of Stengel as too logical a thing to happen in Brooklyn, but on February 24, 1934, Stengel faced the press for the first time as the manager of a major league team. McGraw, Stengel&#x27;s mentor, was too ill to issue a statement on seeing him become a major league manager; he died the following day.

Stengel, hired only days before spring training, had a limited opportunity to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, where they would end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia&#x27;s Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel went out to the mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel got the last laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, squandered that lead, and with two games remaining in the season, were tied with St. Louis. The final two games were against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry&#x27;s comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.

The Dodgers finished fifth in 1935 and seventh in 1936. Dodger management felt Stengel had not done enough with the talent he had been given, and he was fired during the 1936 World Series between the Yankees and Giants. Stengel was paid for one year left on his contract, and he was not involved in baseball during the 1937 season. Stengel had invested in oil properties, as advised by one of his players, Randy Moore, a Texan; the investment helped make the Stengels well-to-do, and they put the profits in California real estate. Stengel considered going in the oil business full-time, but Braves president Bob Quinn offered him the Boston managerial job in late 1937, and he accepted.

Stengel was both manager and an investor in the Braves. In his six years there, 1938 to 1943, his team never finished in the top half of the league standings, and the Boston club finished seventh four straight years between 1939 and 1942, saved from last place by the fact that the Phillies were even worse. The entry of the United States in World War II meant that many top players went into the service, but for the Braves, the changeover made little difference in the standings. Among the young players to join the Braves was pitcher Warren Spahn, who was sent down to the minor leagues by the manager for having &quot;no heart&quot;. Spahn, who would go on to a Hall of Fame career, much of it with the Braves, would play again for Stengel on the woeful New York Mets in 1965, and joke that he was the only person to play for Stengel both before and after he was a genius.

A few days before the opening of the 1943 season, Stengel was hit by a vehicle while crossing Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, and he severely fractured a leg. He missed the first two months of the season, receiving many well-wishers, and reading get-well cards jokingly misaddressed to the hospital&#x27;s psychiatric ward. For the rest of his life, Stengel walked with a limp. At the end of the season, Braves management, tired of minimal progress, fired Stengel, and he received no immediate job offers. Stengel testified about this part of his career before a Senate subcommittee fifteen years later, &quot;I became a major league manager in several cities and was discharged. We call it discharged because there is no question I had to leave&quot;.

=== Return to the minors (1944–1948) ===

Stengel thought the 1943 season would be his last in baseball; Edna urged him to look after the family business interests full-time, and Casey, who had always been an athlete, was reluctant to show himself at a baseball stadium with the imperfectly healed injury. But early in the 1944 season, the minor-league Milwaukee Brewers had a managing vacancy to fill, as the Chicago Cubs had hired away the Brewer manager, Charlie Grimm, who had played with Stengel on the 1919 Pirates. Grimm told the Cubs he was obliged to see the Brewers had a competent replacement, and urged the Brewers to hire Stengel. The team owner, Bill Veeck, stationed as a Marine on Guadalcanal, thought ill of Stengel as a manager, and was very reluctant in his consent when reached by cable. Stengel was adept at fostering good relations with reporters, and the very talented team continued to win; by the end of May, Veeck had withdrawn his objections. The team won the American Association pennant, but lost in the playoffs to Louisville. Veeck, having returned to the United States, offered to rehire Stengel for 1945, but Stengel preferred another offer he received. This was from George Weiss of the New York Yankees, to manage the team Stengel had begun with, the Kansas City Blues, by then a Yankee farm club. Kansas City had finished last in the American Association as Milwaukee won the pennant, making it something of a comedown for Stengel, who hoped to return to the major leagues. Nevertheless, it was in his old home town, allowing him to see friends and relations, and he took the job. The Blues finished seventh in the eight-team league in 1945.

Although there was no major league managing vacancy Stengel could aspire to, the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League had fired their manager, and approached Stengel. The baseball played in the PCL was close to major league level, and the league featured many aging big leaguers finishing their careers. Also attractive to Stengel was that the league had three teams in Southern California, allowing him to spend more time at his home in Glendale. To that time, the club had won only one pennant, and was something of a weak sister to its crossbay rivals, the San Francisco Seals, but owner Brick Laws believed Stengel could mold the players into a winning team.

The Oaks finished second in the league behind the Seals in 1946, winning the first round of the playoffs against Los Angeles before losing to San Francisco in the finals. They finished fourth in 1947, beating San Francisco in the first round before losing to Los Angeles. Stengel managed the Oaks for a third year in 1948, with the roster heavy with former major leaguers. Among the younger players on the team was 20-year-old shortstop Billy Martin. Stengel was impressed by Martin&#x27;s fielding, baseball acuity, and, when there were brawls on the field, fighting ability. The Oaks clinched the pennant on September 26, and defeated Los Angeles and the Seattle Rainiers to win the Governors&#x27; Cup. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Stengel the Minor League Manager of the Year.

== Glory days: Yankee dynasty (1949–1960) ==
=== Hiring and 1949 season ===

Stengel had been talked about as a possible Yankee manager in the early 1940s, but longtime team boss Ed Barrow (who retired in 1945) refused to consider it. Yankee manager Joe McCarthy retired during the 1946 season, and after the interim appointment of catcher Bill Dickey as player-manager, Bucky Harris was given the job in 1947. Stengel&#x27;s name was mentioned for the job before Harris got it; he was backed by Weiss, but Larry MacPhail, then in charge of the franchise, was opposed. Harris and the Yankees won the World Series that year, but finished third in 1948, though they were not eliminated until the penultimate day. Harris was fired, allegedly because he would not give Weiss his home telephone number. MacPhail could no longer block Stengel&#x27;s hiring, as he had sold his interest in the Yankees after the 1947 season. Weiss, who became general manager after MacPhail&#x27;s departure, urged his partners in the Yankees to allow the appointment of Stengel, who aided his own cause by winning the championship with Oakland during the time the Yankee job stood open. Del Webb, who owned part of the Yankees, had initial concerns but went along. Yankee scouts on the West Coast recommended Stengel, and Webb&#x27;s support helped bring around co-owner Dan Topping.

Stengel was introduced as Yankee manager on October 12, 1948, the 25th anniversary of his second World Series home run to beat the Yankees. Joe DiMaggio attended the press conference as a sign of team support. Stengel faced obstacles to being accepted—Harris had been popular with the press and public, and the businesslike Yankee corporate culture and successful tradition were thought to be ill matched with a manager who had the reputation of a clown and who had never had a major league team finish in the top half of the standings. Stengel&#x27;s MLB involvement had been in the National League, and there were several American League parks in which he had neither managed nor played.

Stengel tried to keep a low profile during the 1949 Yankee spring training at St. Petersburg, Florida, but there was considerable media attention as Stengel shuttled rookies from one position on the field to another, and endlessly shuffled his lineup. He had the advantage of diminished expectations, as DiMaggio, the Yankee superstar, was injured with a bone spur in his heel, and few picked New York to win the pennant. There were other injuries once the season began, and Stengel, who had initially planned a conservative, stable lineup in his first American League season, was forced to improvise. Although platooning, playing right-handed batters against left-handed pitchers and the reverse, against whom they are on average more able to hit, had been known for some years, Stengel popularized it, and his use gave the practice its name, coined by a sportswriter and borrowed from football. For example, in the early part of the 1949 season, Stengel might play Bobby Brown at third base and Cliff Mapes and Gene Woodling in the outfield against right-handers. Against left-handers, Stengel might play Billy Johnson at third with Johnny Lindell and Hank Bauer in the outfield.

After the team blew leads and lost both ends of a doubleheader in Philadelphia on May 15, Stengel called a team meeting in which he criticized the players responsible for the two losses, but also predicted greatness for them, and told the team it was going to win. The team then won 13 of its next 14 games. Yankee sportscaster Curt Gowdy, who was present, later stated, &quot;that speech in Philadelphia was the turning point of the season&quot;.

DiMaggio returned from injury on June 28 after missing 65 games. He hit four home runs in three games to help sweep Boston and extend the Yankees&#x27; league lead. Despite DiMaggio&#x27;s return, the lineup remained plagued with injuries. After consulting with Stengel, Weiss obtained Johnny Mize from the Giants, but he was soon sidelined with a separated shoulder. Twelve games behind on the Fourth of July, the Red Sox steadily gained ground on the Yankees, and tied them by sweeping a two-game set at Fenway September 24 and 25, the first time the Yankees had not been in sole possession of first place since the third game of the season. The Red Sox took the lead the following day with a comeback win in a makeup game, as Stengel lost his temper at the umpire for the first time in Yankee uniform; although he was not ejected, he was fined by the league.

The season came down to a two-game set with the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium, with the home team one game behind and needing to win both. Stengel, during the 1949 season, had shown himself more apt than his peers to bring in a relief pitcher, and when during the first game, starter Allie Reynolds gave up the first two runs in the third inning, the manager brought in Joe Page. Though Page walked in two more runs, he shut out the Red Sox the rest of the way as the Yankees came back to win, 5–4. This set up a winner-take-all game for the league title. The Yankees took a 5–0 lead before Boston scored three in the ninth, but Vic Raschi was able to prevent further damage, giving the Yankees the pennant, Stengel&#x27;s first as a major league manager.

In the 1949 World Series, Stengel&#x27;s first as a participant since 1923, the Yankees faced the Brooklyn Dodgers, who were assembling the team that would challenge the Yankees through much of his time in New York. The teams split the first two games, at Yankee Stadium. Before Game 3 at Ebbets Field, Stengel was called upon to introduce his surviving teammates from the 1916 pennant-winning Brooklyn club, which he did emotionally. The Yankees won Game 3, and during Game 4, a Yankee victory, Stengel left the dugout to shout to catcher Yogi Berra to throw the ball to second base, which Berra did to catch Pee Wee Reese trying to take an extra base. For this breach of baseball&#x27;s rules, Stengel was reprimanded after the game by Commissioner Happy Chandler. The Yankees won Game 5 as well to take the Series, and during the celebration after the game, Del Webb said of Stengel to the press, &quot;I knew he would win, whether we got some more players for him or not&quot;.

=== Repeating success (1950–1953) ===

During the 1949 season, Stengel had been more subdued than he usually was, but being the manager of the defending world champions and the Major League Manager of the Year relieved his inhibitions, and he was thereafter his talkative self. He also was more forceful in running the team, not always to the liking of veteran players such as DiMaggio and Phil Rizzuto. As part of his incessant shuffling of the lineup, Stengel had DiMaggio play first base, a position to which he was unaccustomed and refused to play after the first game. Stengel considered DiMaggio&#x27;s decline in play as he neared the end of his stellar career more important than his resentment. In August, with the slugger in the middle of a batting slump, Stengel benched him, stating he needed a rest. DiMaggio returned after six games, and hit .370 for the rest of the season, winning the slugging percentage title. Other young players on the 1950 team were Billy Martin and Whitey Ford. The ascendence of these rookies meant more of the Yankees accepted Stengel&#x27;s techniques, and diminished the number of those from the McCarthy era who resented their new manager. The Detroit Tigers were the Yankees&#x27; main competition, leading for much of the summer, but the Yankees passed them in the middle of September to win the pennant by three games. In the 1950 World Series, the Yankees played the Phillies, another of Stengel&#x27;s old teams. The Yankees won in four games.

Before spring training in 1950, the Yankees had pioneered the idea of an instructional school for rookies and other young players. This was the brainchild of Stengel and Weiss. Complaints from other teams that the Yankees were violating time limits on spring training and were using their money for competitive advantage led to modifications, but the concept survived and was eventually broadly adopted. Among those invited to the 1951 early camp was 19-year-old Mickey Mantle, whose speed and talent awed Stengel, and who had spent the previous year in the minor leagues. Stengel moved Mantle from shortstop to the outfield, reasoning that Rizzuto, the shortstop, was likely to play several more years. Both Mantle and the Yankees started the 1951 season slowly, and on July 14, Mantle was sent to Kansas City to regain his confidence at the plate. He was soon recalled to the Yankees; although he hit only .267 for the season, this was four points better than DiMaggio, in his final season. Much of the burden of winning a third consecutive pennant fell on Berra, who put together an MVP season. The White Sox and then the Indians led the league for much of the summer, but the Yankees, never far behind, put together a torrid final month of the season to win the pennant by five games.
The Yankee opponent in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan&#x27;s Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle&#x27;s career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio stepped to the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left-hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right-handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.

DiMaggio&#x27;s retirement after the 1951 season gave Stengel greater control over the players, as the relationship between superstar and manager had sometimes been fraught. Stengel moved Mantle from right to center field in DiMaggio&#x27;s place. The Yankees were not the favorites to win the pennant again in 1952, with DiMaggio retired, Mantle still recovering from his injury and several Yankees in military service, deployed in the Korean War. Sportswriters favored the Indians. Younger players, some of whom Stengel had developed, came to the fore, with Martin the regular second baseman for the first time. Mantle proved slow to develop, but hit well towards the end of the season to finish at .311. The Yankee season was also slow to get on track; the team had a record of 18–17 on May 30, but they improved thereafter. Stengel prepared nearly 100 different lineup cards for the 1952 season. The race was still tight in early September, and on September 5, Stengel lectured the team for excessive levity on the train after the Yankees lost two of three to Philadelphia. Embarrassed by the episode, which made its way into print, the Yankees responded by winning 15 of their next 19, clinching the pennant on September 27.

The 1952 World Series was against the Brooklyn Dodgers, who by then had their stars of the 1950s such as Jackie Robinson, Gil Hodges and Duke Snider, with the team later nicknamed &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot;. The teams split the first four games. With his pitching staff tired, Stengel gave the start to late-season acquisition Ewell Blackwell, who surrendered four runs in five innings, and the Yankees lost the game in 11 innings to the Dodgers behind Carl Erskine&#x27;s complete game. Needing to win two in a row at Ebbets Field, Stengel pitched Raschi in Game 6, who won it with a save from Reynolds. With no tomorrow in Game 7, Stengel sent four pitchers to the mound. Mantle hit a home run to break a 2–2 tie, Martin preserved the lead by making a difficult catch off a Robinson popup, and Kuzava again secured the final outs for a Series victory, as the Yankees won 4–2 for their fourth straight World Series victory, matching the record set in 1936–1939, also by the Yankees.

The sportswriters had picked other teams to win the pennant in Stengel&#x27;s first four years as Yankee manager; in 1953 they picked the Yankees, and this time they were proven correct. An 18-game winning streak in June placed them well in front, and they coasted to their fifth consecutive league championship, the first time a team had won five straight pennants. The Yankees played the Dodgers again in the World Series, which was less dramatic than the previous year&#x27;s, as the Yankees won in six games, with Mantle, Martin, Berra and Gil McDougald—players developed under Stengel—taking the fore. The Yankees and Stengel won the World Series for the fifth consecutive year, the only team to accomplish that feat. Stengel, having taken the managerial record for consecutive pennants from McGraw (1921–1924) and McCarthy (1936–1939) and for consecutive titles from the latter, would say, &quot;You know, John McGraw was a great man in New York and he won a lot of pennants. But Stengel is in town now, and he&#x27;s won a lot of pennants too&quot;.

=== Middle years (1954–1958) ===
The Yankees started the defense of their title in 1954 with an opening day loss to the Washington Senators in the presence of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Even though the Yankees won 103 games, the most regular season victories they would have under Stengel, they lost by eight games to the Indians, managed by Stengel&#x27;s old friend Al Lopez. In spite of the defeat, Stengel was given a new two-year contract at $75,000 per year.

By the mid-1950s, Stengel was becoming a national figure, familiar from television broadcasts of the Yankees on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Game of the Week&quot;, and from managing in most World Series and All-Star Games during his tenure. National magazines such as &quot;Look&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; did feature stories about Stengel, and his turn of phrase became known as &quot;Stengelese&quot;. The magazines not only told stories about the manager&#x27;s one-liners and jokes, but recounted the pranks from his playing days, such as the grapefruit dropped from the plane and the sparrow under the cap. According to Richard Bak in his biography of Stengel, &quot;people across the country grew enamored of the grandfatherly fellow whose funny looks and fractured speech were so at odds with the Yankees&#x27; bloodless corporate image&quot;.
The Yankees won the pennant again in 1955, breaking open a close pennant race in September to take the American League. They played the Dodgers again in the World Series, which the Dodgers won in seven games. The Dodgers won Game 7, 2–0, behind the pitching of Johnny Podres and Stengel, after losing his first World Series as a manager, blamed himself for not instructing his hitters to bat more aggressively against Podres. Billy Martin stated, &quot;It&#x27;s a shame for a great manager like that to have to lose&quot;.

There was not much of a pennant race in the American League in 1956, with the Yankees leading from the second week of the season onwards. With little suspense as to the team&#x27;s standing, much attention turned to Mantle&#x27;s batting, as he made a serious run at Babe Ruth&#x27;s record at the time of 60 home runs in a season, finishing with 52, and won the Triple Crown. On August 25, Old-Timers&#x27; Day, Stengel and Weiss met with the little-used Rizzuto, the last of the &quot;McCarthy Yankees&quot; and released him from the team so they could acquire Enos Slaughter. Never a Stengel fan, the process left Rizzuto bitter.

The World Series opponent that year was again the Dodgers, who won the first two games at Ebbets Field. Stengel lectured the team before Game 3 at Yankee Stadium and the team responded with a victory then and in Game 4. For Game 5, Stengel pitched Don Larsen, who had been knocked out of Game 2, and who responded with a perfect game, the only one in major league postseason history. The Dodgers won Game 6 as the Series returned to Ebbets Field. Many expected Whitey Ford to start Game 7, but Stengel chose Johnny Kucks, an 18-game winner that season who had been used twice in relief in the Series. Kucks threw a three-hit shutout as the Yankees won the championship, 9–0, Stengel&#x27;s sixth as their manager.

New York got off to a slow start in the 1957 season, and by early June was six games out. By then, the team was making headlines off the field. Some of the Yankees were known for partying late into the night, something Stengel turned a blind eye to as long as the team performed well. The May 16 brawl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York involved Martin, Berra, Mantle, Ford, Hank Bauer and other Yankees, resulted in the arrest of Bauer (the charge of assault was later dropped) and exhausted Yankee management&#x27;s patience with Martin. Stengel was close to Martin, who took great pride in being a Yankee, and Topping and Weiss did not involve the manager in the trade talks that ensued. On June 15, Martin was traded to the Kansas City Athletics. Martin wrote in his autobiography that Stengel could not look him in the eye as the manager told him of the trade. The two, once close friends, rarely spoke in the years to come.

The Yankees recovered from their slow start, winning the American League pennant by eight games. They faced the Milwaukee Braves in the 1957 World Series. The Braves (Stengel had managed them when they played in Boston) defeated the Yankees in seven games, with Lew Burdette, who had been a Yankee until traded in 1950, beating New York three times. Stengel stated in an interview, &quot;We&#x27;re going to have Burditis on our minds next year&quot;.

What was seen as a failure to keep discipline on the team hurt Stengel&#x27;s standing with the Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67 and had several times fallen asleep in the dugout, and players complained that he was growing more irritable with the years. Former Yankee catcher Ralph Houk, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel&#x27;s first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel&#x27;s contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the 1958 World Series. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of Bob Turley (who got two wins and a save in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.

=== Final years and firing (1959–1960) ===
The Yankees finished 79–75 in 1959, in third place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won the pennant. There was considerable criticism of Stengel, who was viewed as too old and out of touch with the players.

After the 1959 season, Weiss made a trade with Kansas City to bring Roger Maris to the Yankees. Stengel was delighted with the acquisition and batted Maris third in the lineup, just in front of Mantle, and the new Yankee responded with an MVP season in 1960. Stengel had health issues during the season, spending ten days in the hospital in late May and early June, with the illness variously reported as a bladder infection, a virus or influenza. The Yankees were challenged by the Baltimore Orioles for most of the year but won the pennant by eight games, Stengel&#x27;s tenth as manager, tying the major league record held by McGraw.

The Yankees played the Pittsburgh Pirates, again a team Stengel had played for, in the 1960 World Series. Stengel picked Art Ditmar, who had won the most games, 15, for the Yankees, as the Game 1 starter rather than the established star, Whitey Ford. The Pirates knocked Ditmar out of the box in the first inning, and won Game 1. Ditmar was also knocked out of Game 5; Ford won Games 3 and 6 of the seven-game series with shutouts, but could not pitch Game 7, as he might have if Stengel had used him in Games 1 and 5. The Pirates defeated the Yankees in Game 7, 10–9, on a ninth-inning home run by Bill Mazeroski.

Shortly after the Yankees returned to New York, Stengel was informed by the team owners that he would not be given a new contract. His request, that the termination be announced at a press conference, was granted and on October 18, 1960, Topping and Stengel appeared before the microphones. After Topping evaded questions from the press about whether Stengel had been fired, Stengel took the microphone, and when asked if he had been fired, stated, &quot;Quit, fired, whatever you please, I don&#x27;t care&quot;. Topping stated that Stengel was being terminated because of his age, 70, and alleged that this would have happened even had the Yankees won the World Series.

==The Amazins&#x27;: Casey and the Mets (1962–1965)==
=== Hiring and 1962 season ===
Two days after dismissing Stengel, the Yankees announced the hiring of Houk as his replacement—part of the reason for Stengel&#x27;s firing was so that New York would not lose Houk to another team. Stengel returned to Glendale, and spent the 1961 season out of baseball for the first time since 1937. He turned down several job offers to manage, from the Tigers, San Francisco Giants and the expansion Los Angeles Angels. He spent the summer of 1961 as vice president of the Glendale Valley National Bank, which was owned by members of Edna Stengel&#x27;s family.

As part of baseball&#x27;s expansion in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, to play in the National League beginning in 1962, and to be known as the New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that Stengel took the job to give something back to the game that had been his life for half a century.

Weiss was convinced his scouting staff would make the Mets a respectable team in five to six years, but in the interim New York would most likely do poorly. He hoped to overcome the challenge of attracting supporters to a losing team in the &quot;City of Winners&quot; by drafting well-known players who would draw fans to the Polo Grounds, where the Mets would initially play. Thus, the Mets selected a number of over-the-hill National Leaguers, some of whom had played for the Dodgers or Giants, including Gil Hodges, Roger Craig, Don Zimmer and Frank Thomas. Selected before them all was journeyman catcher Hobie Landrith; as Stengel explained, &quot;You have to have a catcher or you&#x27;ll have a lot of passed balls&quot;.

The return of Casey Stengel to spring training received considerable publicity, and when the Mets played the Yankees in an exhibition game, Stengel played his best pitchers while the Yankees treated it as a meaningless game, and the Mets won, 4–3. The team won nearly as many games as it lost in spring training, but Stengel warned, &quot;I ain&#x27;t fooled. They play different when the other side is trying too&quot;. The Mets lost their first nine games of the regular season; in the meantime the Pirates were 10–0, meaning the Mets were already 9 games out of first place. Some light appeared in May, when the Mets won 11 of 18 games to reach eighth place in the ten-team league. They then lost 17 in a row, returning to last place, where they would spend the remainder of the season.

According to sportswriter Joseph Durso, on days when [Stengel&#x27;s] amazing Mets were, for some reason, amazing, he simply sat back and let the writers swarm over the heroes of the diamond. On days when the Mets were less than amazing—and there were many more days like that—he stepped into the vacuum and diverted the writers&#x27; attention, and typewriters, to his own flamboyance ... the perfect link with the public was formed, and it grew stronger as the team grew zanier.

The Mets appealed to the younger generation of fans and became an alternative to the stuffy Yankees. As the losing continued, a particular fan favorite was &quot;Marvelous&quot; Marv Throneberry, who was a &quot;lightning-rod for disaster&quot; in the 1962 season, striking out to kill rallies, or dropping pop flies and routine throws to first base. During one game, Throneberry hit a massive shot to right, winding up on third base, only to be called out for missing first. Stengel came from the dugout to argue, only to be told that Throneberry had missed second base as well.

Stengel tried incessantly to promote the Mets, talking to reporters or anyone else who would listen. He often used the word &quot;amazin (as he put it) and soon this became the &quot;Amazin&#x27; Mets&quot;, a nickname that stuck. Stengel urged the fans, &quot;Come out and see my amazin&#x27; Mets. I been in this game a hundred years but I see new ways to lose I never knew existed before&quot;. Stengel was successful in selling the team to some extent, as the Mets drew 900,000 fans, half again as many as the Giants had prior to their departure, though the games against the Giants and Dodgers accounted for half of the total. The team was less successful on the field, finishing with a record of 40–120, the most losses of any 20th century major league team. They finished 60 games behind the pennant-winning Giants, and 18 games behind ninth-place Chicago.

=== Later seasons and retirement (1963–1965) ===
The 1963 season unfolded for the Mets much like the previous year&#x27;s, though they lost only eight games to begin the season, rather than nine, but they still finished 51–111, in last place. One highlight, though it did not count in the standings, was the Mayor&#x27;s Trophy Game on June 20 at Yankee Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 6–2.

In 1964, the Mets moved into the new Shea Stadium; Stengel commented that &quot;the park is lovelier than my team&quot;. The Mets finished 53–109, again in last place. By this time, the fans were starting to be impatient with the losing, and a number of people, including sportscaster Howard Cosell and former Dodger Jackie Robinson, criticized Stengel as ineffective and prone to fall asleep on the bench. Stengel was given a contract for 1965, though Creamer suggested that Weiss, Grant and Payson would have preferred that the 74-year-old Stengel retire.

The early part of the 1965 season saw similar futility. On July 25, the Mets had a party at Toots Shor&#x27;s for the invitees to the following day&#x27;s Old-Timers&#x27; Game. Sometime during that evening, Stengel fell off a barstool and broke his hip. The circumstances of his fall are not known with certainty, as he did not realize he had been severely injured until the following day. Stengel spent his 75th birthday in the hospital. Recognizing that considerable rehabilitation would be required, he retired as manager of the Mets on August 30, replaced by Wes Westrum, one of his coaches. The Mets would again finish in last place.

==Later years and death==
The Mets retired Stengel&#x27;s uniform number, 37, on September 2, 1965, after which he returned to his home in California. He was kept on the team payroll as a vice president, but for all intents and purposes he was out of baseball. His life settled into a routine of attending the World Series (especially when in California), the All-Star Game, Mets spring training, and the baseball writers&#x27; dinner in New York. The writers, who elect members of baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame, considered it unjust that Stengel should have to wait the usual five years after retirement for election, and waived that rule. On March 8, 1966, at a surprise ceremony at the Mets spring training site in St. Petersburg, Stengel was told of his election; he was inducted in July along with Ted Williams. Thereafter, he added the annual Hall of Fame induction ceremony to his schedule. In 1969, the &quot;Amazin&#x27; Mets&quot; justified their nickname by unexpectedly winning the World Series over the favored Orioles. Stengel attended the Series, threw out the first ball for Game 3 at Shea, and visited the clubhouse after the Mets triumphed in Game 5 to win the Series. The Mets presented him with a championship ring.

Stengel also participated in Old-Timers&#x27; Day at a number of ballparks, including, regularly, Shea Stadium. In 1970, the Yankees invited him to Old-Timers&#x27; Day, at which his number, 37, was to be retired. By this time, the Yankee ownership had changed, and the people responsible for his dismissal were no longer with the team. He accepted and attended, and Stengel became the fifth Yankee to have his number retired. He thereafter became a regular at the Yankees&#x27; Old-Timers&#x27; Day.

By 1971, Edna Stengel was showing signs of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and in 1973, following a stroke, she was moved into a nursing home. Casey Stengel continued to live in his Glendale home with the help of his housekeeper June Bowdin. Stengel himself showed signs of senility in his last years, and during the final year of his life, these increased. In his last year, Stengel cut back on his travel schedule, and was too ill to attend the Yankees&#x27; Old-Timers Day game in August 1975, at which it was announced that Billy Martin would be the new team manager. A diagnosis of cancer of the lymph glands had been made, and Stengel realized he was dying. In mid-September, he was admitted to Glendale Memorial Hospital, but the cancer was inoperable. He died there on September 29, 1975. Stengel was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale.

The tributes to Stengel upon his death were many. Maury Allen wrote, &quot;He is gone and I am supposed to cry, but I laugh. Every time I saw the man, every time I heard his voice, every time his name was mentioned, the creases in my mouth would give way and a smile would come to my face&quot;. Richie Ashburn, a member of the 1962 Mets, stated, &quot;Don&#x27;t shed any tears for Casey. He wouldn&#x27;t want you to ... He was the happiest man I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Jim Murray of the &quot;Los Angeles Times &quot; wrote, &quot;God is certainly getting an earful tonight&quot;.

Edna Stengel died in 1978, and was interred next to her husband. In addition to the marker at their graves in Forest Lawn Cemetery, there is a plaque nearby in tribute to Casey Stengel, which besides biographical information contains a bit of Stengelese: &quot;There comes a time in every man&#x27;s life, and I&#x27;ve had plenty of them&quot;.

==Managerial record==
==Awards and honors==


As part of professional baseball&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 1969, Stengel was voted its &quot;Greatest Living Manager&quot;. He had his uniform number, 37, retired by both the Yankees and the Mets. He is the first man in MLB history to have had his number retired by more than one team based solely upon his managerial accomplishments, and was joined in that feat in 2011 by the late Sparky Anderson, who had called Stengel &quot;the greatest man&quot; in the history of baseball. The Yankees dedicated a plaque in Yankee Stadium&#x27;s Monument Park in Stengel&#x27;s memory on July 30, 1976, reading: &quot;Brightened baseball for over 50 years; with spirit of eternal youth; Yankee manager 1949–1960 winning 10 pennants and 7 world championships including a record 5 consecutive, 1949–1953&quot;. He was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in 1981.

Stengel is the only man to have worn the uniform (as player or manager) of all four Major League Baseball teams in New York City in the 20th century: the Dodgers, Giants, Yankees and Mets. He is the only person to have played or managed for the home team in five New York City major league venues: Washington Park, Ebbets Field, the Polo Grounds, Shea Stadium and the original Yankee Stadium. In 2009, in an awards segment on the MLB Network titled &quot;The Prime 9&quot;, he was named &quot;The Greatest Character of The Game&quot;, beating out Yogi Berra.

== Managerial techniques ==
Stengel re-invigorated platooning in baseball. Most of Stengel&#x27;s playing days were after offensive platooning, choosing left-handed batters against a right-handed pitcher and the converse, was used successfully by the World Series champion 1914 Boston &quot;Miracle&quot; Braves. This set off widespread use of platooning: Stengel himself was several times during his playing career platooned against right-handers, but the practice fell into disuse around 1930. Stengel reintroduced it to the Yankees, and its prominent use amid the team&#x27;s success caused it to be imitated by other teams. Bill James deemed Stengel and Earl Weaver the most successful platoon managers.

This strategic selection also applied to the pitchers, as Stengel leveraged his staff, starting his best pitchers against the best opponents. Although Stengel is best known for doing this with the Yankees, he also did it in his days managing Brooklyn and Boston, and to a very limited extent with the Mets. Rather than have a regular pitching rotation to maximize the number of starts a pitcher will have, Stengel often rested pitchers longer to take advantage of situational advantages which he perceived. For example, Stengel started Eddie Lopat against Cleveland whenever possible, because he regularly beat them. Stengel&#x27;s 1954 Yankees had the highest sabermetrics measurement of Leverage Points Average of any 20th century baseball team. Leveraging became unpopular after choices of starting pitchers based on it backfired on Lopez in the 1959 World Series and on Stengel in the following year&#x27;s—he waited until Game 3 to start Whitey Ford because he felt Ford would be more effective at Yankee Stadium rather than at the small Forbes Field. Ford pitched two shutouts, including Game 6 at Forbes Field, but could not pitch in the Yankees&#x27; Game 7 loss. Stengel&#x27;s philosophy took another blow in 1961 when Houk used Ford in a regular rotation and the pitcher went 25–4 and won the Cy Young Award—he had never won 20 games under Stengel. Today, teams prefer, for the most part, a regular rotation.

James noted that Stengel was not only the most successful manager of the 1950s, he was the most dominant manager of any single decade in baseball history. Stengel used his entire squad as Yankee manager, in contrast to other teams when he began his tenure, on which substitutes tended to get little playing time. Stengel&#x27;s use of platooning meant more players saw more use, and he was generally more prone to put in a pinch hitter or replace his pitcher than other managers. Although only once in Stengel&#x27;s time (1954) did the Yankees lead the league in number of pinch hitters, Stengel was known for using them in odd situations, once pinch-hitting for Moose Skowron in the first inning after a change of pitcher. Additionally, according to James, Stengel &quot;rotated lineups with mad abandon, using perhaps 70 to 100 different lineups in a 154 game season&quot;. Although Stengel was not the first Yankee manager to use a regular relief pitcher—Harris had seen success with Joe Page in 1947—his adoption of the concept did much to promote it.

Stengel often rotated infielders between positions, with the Yankees having no real regular second baseman or shortstop between 1954 and 1958. Despite this, the Yankees had a strong defensive infield throughout. Stengel gave great attention to the double play, both defensively and in planning his lineup, and the Yankees responded by being first in the league in double plays as a defense six times in his twelve-year tenure, and the batters hit into the fewest double plays as a team eight times in that era. Having had few players he could rely upon while managing Brooklyn and Boston, Stengel treated his Yankee roster with little sentimentality, trading players quickly when their performance seemed to decline, regardless of past accomplishments. Assured of quality replacements secured by the Yankee front office, the technique worked well, but was not a success with the Mets, where no quality replacements were available, and the technique caused confusion and apathy among the players.

==Appraisal==
Marty Appel wrote of Stengel, &quot;He was not a man for all seasons; he was a man for baseball seasons&quot;. Stengel remains the only manager to lead his club to victory in five consecutive World Series. How much credit he is due for that accomplishment is controversial, due to the talent on the Yankee teams he managed—&quot;Total Baseball&quot; deemed that the Yankees won only six games more than expected during the Stengel years, given the number of runs scored and allowed. According to Bak, &quot;the argument—even among some Yankees—was that the team was so good &quot;anybody&quot; could manage it to a title&quot;. Rizzuto stated, &quot;You or I could have managed and gone away for the summer and still won those pennants&quot;. Appel noted, &quot;There was no doubt, by taking on the Mets job, he hurt his reputation as a manager. Once again, it was clear that with good players he was a good manager, and with bad players, not. Still, his Yankee years had put him so high on the list of games won, championships won, etc., that he will always be included in conversations about the greatest managers&quot;.

Bill Veeck said of Stengel in 1966, soon after the manager&#x27;s retirement, &quot;He was never necessarily the greatest of managers, but any time he had a ball club that had a chance to win, he&#x27;d win&quot;. Stengel&#x27;s American League rival, Al Lopez, once said of him &quot;I swear I don&#x27;t understand some of the things he does when he manages&quot;. Though platooning survives, Stengel&#x27;s intuitive approach to managing is no longer current in baseball, replaced by the use of statistics, and the advent of instant replay makes obsolete Stengel&#x27;s tendency to charge from the dugout to confront an umpire over a disputed call.

Stengel has been praised for his role in successfully launching the Mets. Appel deemed the Mets&#x27; beginnings unique, as later expansion teams have been given better players to begin with, &quot;few expansion teams in any sport have tried the formula—a quotable, fan-popular man who would charm the press and deflect attention away from ineptness on the field&quot;. Arthur Daley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;he gave the Mets the momentum they needed when they needed it most. He was the booster that got them off the ground and on their journey. The smoke screen he generated to accompany the blast-off obscured the flaws and gave the Mets an acceptance and a following they could not have obtained without him&quot;. James wrote, &quot;Stengel became such a giant character that you really can&#x27;t talk about him in the past. He became an enduring part of the game&quot;. Commissioner William Eckert said of Stengel, &quot;he&#x27;s probably done more for baseball than anyone&quot;.

A child of the Jim Crow era, and from a border state (Missouri) with southern characteristics, Stengel has sometimes been accused of being a racist, for example by Roy Campanella Jr., who stated that Stengel made racist remarks from the dugout during the World Series towards his father Roy Campanella, Jackie Robinson and other black stars of the Dodgers. Bak noted, though, that Stengel was a &quot;vicious and inventive&quot; bench jockey, hazing the other team with whatever might throw off their performance. Stengel had poor relations with Robinson; each disliked the other and was a vocal critic. One widely quoted Stengel comment was about catcher Elston Howard, who became the first black Yankee in 1955, eight years after Robinson had broken the color barrier, &quot;they finally get me a nigger, I get the only one who can&#x27;t run&quot;. Howard, though, denied that Stengel had shouted racial epithets at the Dodgers, and said &quot;I never felt any prejudice around Casey&quot;. Al Jackson, a black pitcher with the Mets under Stengel, concurred, &quot;He never treated me with anything but respect&quot;. According to Bill Bishop in his account of Stengel, &quot;Casey did use language that would certainly be considered offensive today, but was quite common vernacular in the fifties. He was effusive in his praise of black players like Satchel Paige, Larry Doby and Howard&quot;. Conscious of changing times, Stengel was more careful in his choice of words while with the Mets.
Stengel was sometimes considered thoughtless or even cruel towards his players. Examples of this include his playing Joe DiMaggio at first base, and sometimes batting Phil Rizzuto ninth, behind the pitcher, as well as his dismissal of the shortshop on Old-Timers&#x27; Day in 1956. In spite of their falling out over the 1957 trade, Billy Martin, by then manager of the Yankees, wore a black armband in remembrance of Stengel during the 1976 season, the sole Yankee to do so. According to Creamer, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t seem to be stretching the point too far to say that Ned Hanlon begat John McGraw who begat Casey Stengel who begat Billy Martin&quot;.

<doc id="75127" wikidata="Q627537" url="?curid=75127" title="Monoplane">
<text>A monoplane is a fixed-wing aircraft configuration with a single mainplane, in contrast to a biplane or other types of multiplanes, which have multiple wings.

A monoplane has inherently the highest efficiency and lowest drag of any wing configuration and is the simplest to build. However, during the early years of flight, these advantages were offset by its greater weight and lower manoeuvrability, making it relatively rare until the 1930s. Since then, the monoplane has been the most common form for a fixed-wing aircraft.

==Characteristics==
===Support and weight===
The inherent efficiency of the monoplane is best achieved in the cantilever wing, which carries all structural forces internally. However, to fly at practical speeds the wing must be made thin, which requires a heavy structure to make it strong and stiff enough.

External bracing can be used to improve structural efficiency, reducing weight and cost. For a wing of a given size, the weight reduction allows it to fly slower and with a lower-powered and more economical engine. For this reason, all monoplane wings in the pioneer era were braced and most were up until the early 1930s. However, the exposed struts or wires create additional drag, lowering aerodynamic efficiency and reducing the maximum speed.

High-speed and long-range designs tend to be pure cantilevers, while low-speed short-range types are often given bracing.
Besides the general variations in wing configuration such as tail position and use of bracing, the main distinction between types of monoplane is where the wing is mounted vertically on the fuselage.

===Low===

A low wing is one which is located on or near the bottom of the fuselage.

Placing the wing low allows good visibility upwards and frees the central fuselage from the wing spar carry-through. By reducing pendulum stability, it makes the aircraft more maneuverable, as on the Spitfire; but aircraft that value stability over maneuverability may then need some dihedral.

A feature of the low-wing position is its significant ground effect, giving the plane a tendency to float farther before landing. Conversely, this ground effect permits shorter takeoffs.

===Mid===
A mid wing is mounted midway up the fuselage. The carry-through spar structure can reduce the useful fuselage volume near its centre of gravity, where space is often in most demand.

===Shoulder===

A shoulder wing (a category between high-wing and mid-wing) is a configuration whereby the wing is mounted near the top of the fuselage but not on the very top. It is so called because it sits on the &quot;shoulder&quot; of the fuselage, rather than on the pilot&#x27;s shoulder. Shoulder-wings and high-wings share some characteristics, namely: they support a pendulous fuselage which requires no wing dihedral for stability; and, by comparison with a low-wing, a shoulder-wing&#x27;s limited ground effect reduces float on landing. Compared to a low-wing, shoulder-wing and high-wing configurations give increased propeller clearance on multi-engined aircraft.
On a large aircraft, there is little practical difference between a shoulder wing and a high wing; but on a light aircraft, the configuration is significant because it offers superior visibility to the pilot. On light aircraft, shoulder-wings tend to be mounted further aft than a high wing, and so may need to be swept forward to maintain correct center of gravity. Examples of light aircraft with shoulder wings include the ARV Super2, the Bölkow Junior, Saab Safari and the Barber Snark.
A high wing has its upper surface on or above the top of the fuselage. It shares many advantages and disadvantages with the shoulder wing, but on a light aircraft, the high wing has poorer upwards visibility. On light aircraft such as the Cessna 152, the wing is usually located above the cabin, so that the wing spar passes over the occupants&#x27; heads, leaving the wing in the ideal fore-aft position.
An advantage of the high-wing configuration is that the fuselage is closer to the ground which eases cargo loading, especially for aircraft with a rear-fuselage cargo door. Military cargo aircraft are predominantly high-wing designs with a rear cargo door.

===Parasol===

A parasol wing is not directly attached to the fuselage but held above it, supported by either cabane struts or a pylon. Additional bracing may be provided by struts or wires extending from the fuselage sides.

The first parasol monoplanes were adaptations of shoulder wing monoplanes, since raising a shoulder mounted wing above the fuselage greatly improved visibility downwards, which was useful for reconnaissance roles, as with the widely used Morane-Saulnier L.
The parasol wing allows for an efficient design with good pilot visibility, and was adopted for some fighters such as the Fokker D.VIII and Morane-Saulnier AI in the later part of the First World War.

A parasol wing also provides a high mounting point for engines and during the interwar period was popular on flying boats, which need to lift the propellers clear of spray. Examples include the Martin M-130, Dornier Do 18 and the Consolidated PBY Catalina.

Compared to a biplane, a parasol wing has less bracing and lower drag. It remains a popular configuration for amphibians and small homebuilt and ultralight aircraft.

==History==
Although the first successful aircraft were biplanes, the first attempts at heavier-than-air flying machines were monoplanes, and many pioneers continued to develop monoplane designs. For example, the first aeroplane to be put into production was the 1907 Santos-Dumont Demoiselle, while the Blériot XI flew across the English Channel in 1909. Throughout 1909–1910, Hubert Latham set multiple altitude records in his Antoinette IV monoplane, eventually reaching .
The equivalent German language term is &quot;Eindecker&quot;, as in the mid-wing Fokker Eindecker fighter of 1915 which for a time dominated the skies in what became known as the &quot;Fokker scourge&quot;. The German military Idflieg aircraft designation system prior to 1918 prefixed monoplane type designations with an &quot;E&quot;, until the approval of the Fokker D.VIII fighter from its former &quot;E.V&quot; designation. However, the success of the Fokker was short-lived, and World War I was dominated by biplanes. Towards the end of the war, the parasol monoplane became popular and successful designs were produced into the 1920s.

Nonetheless, relatively few monoplane types were built between 1914 and the late 1920s, compared with the number of biplanes. The reasons for this were primarily practical. With the low engine powers and airspeeds available, the wings of a monoplane needed to be large in order to create enough lift while a biplane could have two smaller wings and so be made smaller and lighter.

Towards the end of the First World War, the inherent high drag of the biplane was beginning to restrict performance. Engines were not yet powerful enough to make the heavy cantilever-wing monoplane viable, and the braced parasol wing became popular on fighter aircraft, although few arrived in time to see combat. It remained popular throughout the 1920s.

On flying boats with a shallow hull, a parasol wing allows the engines to be mounted above the spray from the water when taking off and landing. This arrangement was popular on flying boats during the 1930s; a late example being the Consolidated PBY Catalina. It died out when taller hulls became the norm during World War II, allowing a high wing to be attached directly to the hull.

As ever-increasing engine powers made the weight of all-metal construction and the cantilever wing more practical — first pioneered together by the revolutionary German Junkers J 1 factory demonstrator in 1915–16 — they became common during the post–World War I period, the day of the braced wing passed, and by the 1930s, the cantilever monoplane was fast becoming the standard configuration for a fixed-wing aircraft. Advanced monoplane fighter-aircraft designs were mass-produced for military services around the world in both the Soviet Union and the United States in the early–mid 1930s, with the Polikarpov I-16 and the Boeing P-26 Peashooter respectively.

Most military aircraft of WWII were monoplanes, as have been virtually all aircraft since, except for a few specialist types.

Jet and rocket engines have even more power and all modern high-speed aircraft, especially supersonic types, have been monoplanes.
