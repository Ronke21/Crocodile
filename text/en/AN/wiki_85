<text>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is the military engineering branch of the United States Army. A direct reporting unit (DRU), it has three primary mission areas: Engineer Regiment, military construction, and civil works. USACE has 37,000 civilian and military personnel, making it one of the world&#x27;s largest public engineering, design, and construction management agencies. The USACE workforce is approximately 97% civilian, 3% active duty military. The civilian workforce is mainly located in the United States, Europe and in select Middle East office locations. Civilians do not function as active duty military and are not required to be in active war and combat zones; however, volunteer (with pay) opportunities do exist for civilians to do so. 

The day-to-day activities of the three mission areas are administered by a lieutenant general known as the chief of engineers/commanding general. The chief of engineers commands the Engineer Regiment, comprising combat engineer, rescue, construction, dive, and other specialty units, and answers directly to the Chief of Staff of the Army. Combat engineers, sometimes called sappers, form an integral part of the Army&#x27;s combined arms team and are found in all Army service components: Regular Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve. Their duties are to breach obstacles; construct fighting positions, fixed/floating bridges, and obstacles and defensive positions; place and detonate explosives; conduct route clearance operations; emplace and detect landmines; and fight as provisional infantry when required. For the military construction mission, the chief of engineers is directed and supervised by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for installations, environment, and energy, whom the President appoints and the Senate confirms. Military construction relates to construction on military bases and worldwide installations.

On 16 June 1775, the Continental Congress, gathered in Philadelphia, granted authority for the creation of a &quot;Chief Engineer for the Army&quot;. Congress authorized a corps of engineers for the United States on 11 March 1779. The Corps as it is known today came into being on 16 March 1802, when the president was authorized to &quot;organize and establish a Corps of Engineers ... that the said Corps ... shall be stationed at West Point in the State of New York and shall constitute a Military Academy.&quot; A Corps of Topographical Engineers, authorized on 4 July 1838, merged with the Corps of Engineers in March 1863.

Civil works are managed and supervised by the Assistant Secretary of the Army. Army civil works include three U.S. Congress-authorized business lines: navigation, flood and storm damage protection, and aquatic ecosystem restoration. Civil works is also tasked with administering the Clean Water Act Section 404 program, including recreation, hydropower, and water supply at USACE flood control reservoirs, and environmental infrastructure. The civil works staff oversee construction, operation, and maintenance of dams, canals and flood protection in the U.S., as well as a wide range of public works throughout the world. Some of its dams, reservoirs, and flood control projects also serve as public outdoor recreation facilities. Its hydroelectric projects provide 24% of U.S. hydropower capacity. 

The Corps of Engineers is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and has a budget of $7.8 billion (FY2021).

The corps&#x27;s mission is to &quot;deliver vital public and military engineering services; partnering in peace and war to strengthen our nation&#x27;s security, energize the economy and reduce risks from disasters.&quot;

Its most visible civil works missions include:

* Planning, designing, building, and operating locks and dams. Other civil engineering projects include flood control, beach nourishment, and dredging for waterway navigation.
* Design and construction of flood protection systems through various federal mandates.
* Design and construction management of military facilities for the Army, Air Force, Army Reserve, and Air Force Reserve as well as other Department of Defense and federal government agencies.
* Environmental regulation and ecosystem restoration.

==History==
===18th century===

The history of United States Army Corps of Engineers can be traced back to the American Revolution. On 16 June 1775, the Continental Congress organized the Corps of Engineers, whose initial staff included a chief engineer and two assistants. Colonel Richard Gridley became General George Washington&#x27;s first chief engineer. One of his first tasks was to build fortifications near Boston at Bunker Hill. The Continental Congress recognized the need for engineers trained in military fortifications and asked the government of King Louis XVI of France for assistance. Many of the early engineers in the Continental Army were former French officers.

Louis Lebègue Duportail, a lieutenant colonel in the French Royal Corps of Engineers, was secretly sent to North America in March 1777 to serve in George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army. In July 1777 he was appointed colonel and commander of all engineers in the Continental Army and, on 17 November 1777, he was promoted to brigadier general. When the Continental Congress created a separate Corps of Engineers in May 1779, Duportail was appointed as its commander. In late 1781 he directed the construction of the allied U.S.-French siege works at the Battle of Yorktown.

On 26 February 1783, the Corps was disbanded. It was re-established during the Presidency of George Washington.

From 1794 to 1802, the engineers were combined with the artillery as the Corps of Artillerists and Engineers.

===19th century===

The Corps of Engineers, as it is known today, was established on 16 March 1802, when President Thomas Jefferson signed the Military Peace Establishment Act, whose aim was to &quot;organize and establish a Corps of Engineers ... that the said Corps ... shall be stationed at West Point in the State of New York and shall constitute a military academy.&quot; Until 1866, the superintendent of the United States Military Academy was always an Engineer Officer.

The General Survey Act of 1824 authorized the use of Army engineers to survey road and canal routes for the growing nation. That same year, Congress passed an &quot;Act to Improve the Navigation of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers&quot; and to remove sand bars on the Ohio and &quot;planters, sawyers, or snags&quot; (trees fixed in the riverbed) on the Mississippi, for which the Corps of Engineers was identified as the responsible agency.

Separately authorized on 4 July 1838, the Corps of Topographical Engineers consisted only of officers and was used for mapping and the design and construction of federal civil works and other coastal fortifications and navigational routes. It was merged with the Corps of Engineers on 31 March 1863, at which point the Corps of Engineers also assumed the Lakes Survey District mission for the Great Lakes.

In 1841, Congress created the Lake Survey. The survey, based in Detroit, Michigan, was charged with conducting a hydrographical survey of the Northern and Northwestern lakes and preparing and publishing nautical charts and other navigation aids. The Lake Survey published its first charts in 1852.

In the mid-19th century, Corps of Engineers&#x27; officers ran Lighthouse Districts in tandem with U.S. Naval officers.

====Civil War====

The Army Corps of Engineers played a significant role in the American Civil War. Many of the men who would serve in the top leadership in this organization were West Point graduates. Several rose to military fame and power during the Civil War. Some examples include Union generals George McClellan, Henry Halleck, and George Meade; and Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, Joseph Johnston, and P.G.T. Beauregard. The versatility of officers in the Army Corps of Engineers contributed to the success of numerous missions throughout the Civil War. They were responsible for building pontoon and railroad bridges, forts and batteries, destroying enemy supply lines (including railroads), and constructing roads for the movement of troops and supplies. Both sides recognized the critical work of engineers. On 6 March 1861, once the South had seceded from the Union, its legislature passed an act to create a Confederate Corps of Engineers.

The South was initially at a disadvantage in engineering expertise; of the initial 65 cadets who resigned from West Point to accept positions with the Confederate Army, only seven were placed in the Corps of Engineers. The Confederate Congress passed legislation that authorized a company of engineers for every division in the field; by 1865, the CSA had more engineer officers serving in the field of action than the Union Army.

One of the main projects for the Army Corps of Engineers was constructing railroads and bridges. Union forces took advantage of such Confederate infrastructure because railroads and bridges provided access to resources and industry. The Confederate engineers, using slave labor, built fortifications that were used both offensively and defensively, along with trenches that made them harder to penetrate. This method of building trenches was known as the zigzag pattern.

===20th century===

The National Defense Act of 1916 authorized a reserve corps in the Army, and the Engineer Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps and the Engineer Enlisted Reserve Corps became one of the branches. Some of these personnel were called into active service for World War I.

From the beginning, many politicians wanted the Corps of Engineers to contribute to both military construction and civil works. Assigned the military construction mission on 1 December 1941, after the Quartermaster Department struggled with the expanding mission, the Corps built facilities at home and abroad to support the U.S. Army and Air Force. During World War II the USACE program expanded to more than 27,000 military and industrial projects in a $15.3 billion mobilization effort. Included were aircraft, tank assembly, and ammunition plants; camps for 5.3 million soldiers; depots, ports, and hospitals; and the rapid construction of such landmark projects such as the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, Hanford and Oak Ridge among other places, and the Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters across the Potomac from Washington, DC.

In civilian projects, the Corps of Engineers became the lead federal navigation and flood control agency. Congress significantly expanded its civil works activities, becoming a major provider of hydroelectric energy and the country&#x27;s leading provider of recreation. Its role in responding to natural disasters also grew dramatically, especially following the devastating Mississippi Flood of 1927. In the late 1960s, the agency became a leading environmental preservation and restoration agency.

In 1944, specially trained army combat engineers were assigned to blow up underwater obstacles and clear defended ports during the invasion of Normandy. During World War II, the Army Corps of Engineers in the European Theater of Operations was responsible for building numerous bridges, including the first and longest floating tactical bridge across the Rhine at Remagen, and building or maintaining roads vital to the Allied advance across Europe into the heart of Germany. In the Pacific theater, the &quot;Pioneer troops&quot; were formed, a hand-selected unit of volunteer Army combat engineers trained in jungle warfare, knife fighting, and unarmed jujitsu (hand-to-hand combat) techniques. Working in camouflage, the Pioneers cleared jungle, prepared routes of advance and established bridgeheads for the infantry, as well as demolishing enemy installations.

Five commanding generals (chiefs of staff after the 1903 reorganization) of the United States Army held engineer commissions early in their careers. All transferred to other branches before being promoted to the top position. They were Alexander Macomb, George B. McClellan, Henry W. Halleck, Douglas MacArthur, and Maxwell D. Taylor.

===Notable dates and projects===
* The General Survey Act of 1824 authorized use of army engineers to survey roads and canals. The next month, an act to improve navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers initiated the Corps of Engineers&#x27; permanent civil works construction mission. Although the 1824 act to improve the Mississippi and Ohio rivers is often called the first rivers and harbors legislation, the act passed in 1826 was the first to combine authorizations for both surveys and projects, thereby establishing a pattern that continues to the present day.
* Survey and construction of the National Road until Federal funds were withdrawn (1838)
* The tall Washington Monument, completed under the direction and command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey, 1884
* Panama Canal, completed under supervision of Army Engineer officers, 1914
* Flood Control Act of 1936 made flood control a federal policy and officially recognized the Corps of Engineers as the major federal flood control agency
* Bonneville Dam, completed in 1937
* Flood Control Act of 1941, which channelized the Los Angeles River and parts of the Santa Ana River
* USACE took over all real estate acquisition, construction, and maintenance for army facilities, 1941
* There was no road between Costa Rica and Panama until the Corps began one in 1941–1943. The concern was access to the Panama Canal during wartime.
* The Manhattan Project (1942–1946)
* Planning and construction of the Pentagon, completed in 1943 just 16 months after groundbreaking
* Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, first authorized by congress in 1948
* USACE began construction support for NASA leading to major activities at the Manned Spacecraft Center and Kennedy Space Center, 1961
* King Khalid Military City 1973–1987
* The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 86) brought major change in financing by requiring non-federal contributions toward most federal water resource projects
* Cross Florida Barge Canal
* Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway
Occasional civil disasters, including the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, resulted in greater responsibilities for the Corps of Engineers. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore provide other examples of this.

==Organization==
===Headquarters===
The Chief of Engineers and Commanding General (Lt. general) of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has three mission areas: combat engineers, military construction, and civil works. For each mission area the Chief of Engineers/Commanding General is supervised by a different person. For civil works the Commanding General is supervised by the civilian Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works). Three deputy commanding generals (major generals) report to the chief of engineers, who have the following titles: Deputy Commanding General, Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operation, and Deputy Commanding General for Military and International Operations. The Corps of Engineers headquarters is located in Washington, D.C. The headquarters staff is responsible for Corps of Engineers policy and plans the future direction of all other USACE organizations. It comprises the executive office and 17 staff principals. USACE has two civilian directors who head up Military and Civil Works programs in concert with their respective DCG for the mission area.

===Divisions and districts===
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is organized geographically into eight permanent divisions, one provisional division, one provisional district, and one research command reporting directly to the HQ. Within each division, there are several districts. Districts are defined by watershed boundaries for civil works projects and by political boundaries for military projects.
* Great Lakes and Ohio River Division (LRD), located in Cincinnati. Reaches from the St Lawrence Seaway, across the Great Lakes, down the Ohio River Valley to the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers. Covers , parts of 17 states. Serves 56 million people. Its seven districts are located in Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Louisville, Nashville, Pittsburgh, and Huntington, West Virginia. The division commander serves on two national and international decision-making bodies: co-chair of the Lake Superior, Niagara, and Ontario/St Lawrence Seaway boards of control; and the Mississippi River Commission.
* Mississippi Valley Division (MVD), located in Vicksburg, Mississippi. Reaches from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Covers , and portions of 12 states bordering the Mississippi River. Serves 28 million people. Its six districts are located in St. Paul, Minnesota, Rock Island, Illinois, St. Louis, Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans. MVD serves as headquarters for the Mississippi River Commission.
* North Atlantic Division (NAD), headquartered at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, New York. Reaches from Maine to Virginia, including the District of Columbia, with an overseas mission to provide engineering, construction, and project management services to the U.S. European Command and U.S. Africa Command. Serves 62 million people. Its six districts are located in New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Concord, Massachusetts, and Wiesbaden, Germany. NAD has the largest Superfund program in USACE with 60% of the funding. NAD&#x27;s Europe District has done work in dozens of countries and has offices in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Turkey, Georgia, Romania, Bulgaria, Israel, Spain, and soon Botswana.
* Northwestern Division (NWD), located in Portland, Oregon. Reaches from Canada to California, and from the Pacific Ocean to Missouri. Covers nearly in all or parts of 14 states. Its five districts are located in Omaha, Portland, Seattle, Kansas City, and Walla Walla. NWD has 35% of the total Corps of Engineers&#x27; water storage capacity and 75% of the total hydroelectric capacity.
* Pacific Ocean Division (POD), located at Fort Shafter, Hawaii. Reaches across 12 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean from the Arctic Circle to American Samoa below the equator and across the International Date Line, and into Asia. Includes the territories of Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as well as the Freely Associated States including the Republic of Palau, Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. Its four districts are located in Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Anchorage, Alaska; and Honolulu. Unlike other military work, POD designs and builds for all of the military services — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines — in Japan, Korea, and Kwajalein Atoll.
* South Atlantic Division (SAD), located in Atlanta. Reaches from North Carolina to Alabama as well as the Caribbean, and Central and South America. Covers all or parts of six states. Its five districts are located in Wilmington, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, Savannah, Jacksonville, and Mobile. One-third of the stateside Army and one-fifth of the stateside Air Force are located within the division boundaries. The largest single environmental restoration project in the world — the Everglades Restoration — is managed by SAD.
* South Pacific Division (SPD), located in San Francisco. Reaches from California to Colorado and New Mexico. Covers all or parts of seven states. Its four districts are located in Albuquerque, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Francisco. Its region is host to 18 of the 25 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the nation.
* Southwestern Division (SWD), located in Dallas. Reaches from Mexico to Kansas. Covers all or part of seven states. Its four districts are located in Little Rock, Tulsa, Galveston, and Fort Worth. SWD&#x27;s recreation areas are the most visited in USACE with more than of shoreline and 1,172 recreation sites.
* Transatlantic Division (TAD), located in Winchester, Virginia. Supports Federal programs and policies overseas. Consists of the Gulf Region District, the Afghanistan Engineer District South, the Afghanistan Engineer District North, the Middle East District, the USACE Deployment Center and the TAD G2 Intelligence Fusion Center. TAD oversees thousands of projects overseas. TAD overseas locations are staffed primarily by civilian volunteers from throughout USACE. The Corps of Engineers built much of Afghanistan&#x27;s original Ring Road in the early 1960s and returned in 2002. Supports the full spectrum of regional support, including the Afghan National Security Forces, U.S. and Coalition Forces, Counter Narcotics and Border Management, Strategic Reconstruction support to USAID, and the Commander&#x27;s Emergency Response Program.

===The Engineer Regiment===

U.S. Army engineer units outside of USACE Districts and not listed below fall under the Engineer Regiment of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which comprises the majority of Army engineer soldiers. The Regiment includes combat engineers, whose duties are to breach obstacles; construct fighting positions, fixed/floating bridges, and obstacles and defensive positions; place and detonate explosives; conduct route clearance operations; emplace and detect landmines; and fight as provisional infantry when required. It also includes support engineers, who are more focused on construction and sustainment. Headquartered at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, the Engineer Regiment is commanded by the Engineer Commandant, currently a position filled by an Army brigadier general.

The Engineer Regiment includes the U.S. Army Engineer School (USAES) which publishes its mission as: Generate the military engineer capabilities the Army needs: training and certifying Soldiers with the right knowledge, skills, and critical thinking; growing and educating professional leaders; organizing and equipping units; establishing a doctrinal framework for employing capabilities; and remaining an adaptive institution in order to provide Commanders with the freedom of action they need to successfully execute Unified Land Operations.

===Other USACE organizations===
There are several other organizations within the Corps of Engineers:
* Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) — the Corps of Engineers research and development command. ERDC comprises seven laboratories. (see research below)
* U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) — provides engineering and technical services, program and project management, construction management, and innovative contracting initiatives, for programs that are national or broad in scope or not normally provided by other Corps of Engineers elements
* Finance Center, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CEFC) — supports the operating finance and accounting functions throughout the Corps of Engineers
* Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) — provides administrative and operational support for Headquarters, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and various field offices.
* Army Geospatial Center (AGC)  — provides geospatial information, standards, systems, support, and services across the Army and the Department of Defense.
* Marine Design Center (CEMDC) — provides total project management including planning, engineering, and shipbuilding contract management in support of USACE, Army, and national water resource projects in peacetime, and augments the military construction capacity in time of national emergency or mobilization
* Institute for Water Resources (IWR) — supports the Civil Works Directorate and other Corps of Engineers commands by developing and applying new planning evaluation methods, policies and data in anticipation of changing water resources management conditions.
* USACE Logistics Activity (ULA)- Provides logistics support to the Corps of Engineers including supply, maintenance, readiness, materiel, transportation, travel, aviation, facility management, integrated logistics support, management controls, and strategic planning.
* Enterprise Infrastructure Services (CEEIS) — designs information technology standards for the Corps, including automation, communications, management, visual information, printing, records management, and information assurance. CEEIS outsources the maintenance of its IT services, forming the Army Corps of Engineers Information Technology (ACE-IT). ACE-IT is made up of both civilian government employees and contractors.
* Deployable Tactical Operations System (DTOS) — provides mobile command and control platforms in support of the quick ramp-up of initial emergency response missions for the Corps. DTOS is a system designed to respond to District, Division, National, and International events.
*Until 2001 local Directorates of Engineering and Housing (DEH), being constituents of the USACE, had been responsible for the housing, infrastructure and related tasks as environmental protection, garbage removal and special fire departments or fire alarm coordination centers in the garrisons of the U.S. Army abroad as in Europe (e.g. Germany, as in Berlin, Wiesbaden, Karlsruhe etc.) Subsequently, a similar structure called DPWs (Directorates of Public Works), subordinate to the United States Army Installation Management Command, assumed the tasks formerly done by the DEHs.

===Directly reporting military units===
* 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power) — generates and distributes prime electrical power in support of fighting wars, disaster relief, stability and support operations as well as provides advice and technical assistance in all aspects of electrical power and distribution systems.
* 911th Engineer Company — (formerly the MDW Engineer Company) provides specialized technical search and rescue support for the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; it is also a vital support member of the Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region, which is charged with the homeland security of the United States capital region.
* 412th Theater Engineer Command, U.S. Army Reserve, located in Vicksburg, MS.
* 416th Theater Engineer Command, U.S. Army Reserve, located in Darien, IL.

==Mission areas==

===Warfighting===
USACE provides support directly and indirectly to the warfighting effort. They build and help maintain much of the infrastructure that the Army and the Air Force use to train, house, and deploy troops. USACE built and maintained navigation systems and ports provide the means to deploy vital equipment and other material. Corps of Engineers Research and Development (R&amp;D) facilities help develop new methods and measures for deployment, force protection, terrain analysis, mapping, and other support.

USACE directly supports the military in the battle zone, making expertise available to commanders to help solve or avoid engineering (and other) problems. Forward Engineer Support Teams, FEST-A&#x27;s or FEST-M&#x27;s, may accompany combat engineers to provide immediate support, or to reach electronically into the rest of USACE for the necessary expertise. A FEST-A team is an eight-person detachment; a FEST-M is approximately 36. These teams are designed to provide immediate technical-engineering support to the warfighter or in a disaster area. Corps of Engineers&#x27; professionals use the knowledge and skills honed on both military and civil projects to support the U.S. and local communities in the areas of real estate, contracting, mapping, construction, logistics, engineering, and management experience. Prior to their respective troop withdrawals in 2021, this included support for rebuilding Iraq, establishing infrastructure in Afghanistan, and supporting international and inter-agency services.

In addition, the work of almost 26,000 civilians on civil-works programs throughout USACE provides a training ground for similar capabilities worldwide. USACE civilians volunteer for assignments worldwide. For example, hydropower experts have helped repair, renovate, and run hydropower dams in Iraq in an effort to help get Iraqis to become self-sustaining.

===Homeland security===
USACE supports the United States&#x27; Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) through its security planning, force protection, research and development, disaster preparedness efforts, and quick response to emergencies and disasters.

The CoE conducts its emergency response activities under two basic authorities — the Flood Control and Coastal Emergency Act (), and the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (). In a typical year, the Corps of Engineers responds to more than 30 Presidential disaster declarations, plus numerous state and local emergencies. Emergency responses usually involve cooperation with other military elements and Federal agencies in support of State and local efforts.

===Infrastructure support===

Work comprises engineering and management support to military installations, global real estate support, civil works support (including risk and priorities), operations and maintenance of Federal navigation and flood control projects, and monitoring of dams and levees.

More than 67 percent of the goods consumed by Americans and more than half of the nation&#x27;s oil imports are processed through deepwater ports maintained by the Corps of Engineers, which maintains more than of commercially navigable channels across the U.S.

In both its Civil Works mission and Military Construction program, the Corps of Engineers is responsible for billions of dollars of the nation&#x27;s infrastructure. For example, USACE maintains direct control of 609 dams, maintains or operates 257 navigation locks, and operates 75 hydroelectric facilities generating 24% of the nation&#x27;s hydropower and three percent of its total electricity. USACE inspects over 2,000 Federal and non-Federal levees every two years.

Four billion gallons of water per day are drawn from the Corps of Engineers&#x27; 136 multi-use flood control projects comprising of water storage, making it one of the United States&#x27; largest water supply agencies.

The 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power), the only active duty unit in USACE, generates and distributes prime electrical power in support of warfighting, disaster relief, stability and support operations as well as provides advice and technical assistance in all aspects of electrical power and distribution systems. The battalion deployed in support of recovery operations after 9/11 and was instrumental in getting Wall Street back up and running within a week. The battalion also deployed in support of post-Katrina operations.

All of this work represents a significant investment in the nation&#x27;s resources.

===Water resources===

Through its Civil Works program, USACE carries out a wide array of projects that provide coastal protection, flood protection, hydropower, navigable waters and ports, recreational opportunities, and water supply. Work includes coastal protection and restoration, including a new emphasis on a more holistic approach to risk management. As part of this work, USACE is one of the top providers of outdoor recreation in the U.S., so there is a significant emphasis on water safety.

Army involvement in works &quot;of a civil nature,&quot; including water resources, goes back almost to the origins of the U.S. Over the years, as the nation&#x27;s needs have changed, so have the Army&#x27;s Civil Works missions.

Major areas of emphasis include the following:

* Navigation. Supporting navigation by maintaining and improving channels was the Corps of Engineers&#x27; earliest Civil Works mission, dating to Federal laws in 1824 authorizing the Corps to improve safety on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and several ports. Today, the Corps of Engineers maintains more than of inland waterways and operates 235 locks. These waterways—a system of rivers, lakes and coastal bays improved for commercial and recreational transportation—carry about of the nation&#x27;s inter-city freight, at a cost per ton-mile about that of rail or that of trucks. USACE also maintains 300 commercial harbors, through which pass of cargo a year, and more than 600 smaller harbors. New locks are needed, according to the Corps and barge shippers, where existing locks are in poor condition, requiring frequent closures for repairs, and/or because a lock&#x27;s size causes delays for barge tows. 
* Flood Risk Management. The Engineers were first called upon to address flood problems along the Mississippi river in the mid-19th century. They began work on the Mississippi River and Tributaries Flood Control Project in 1928, and the Flood Control Act of 1936 gave the Corps the mission to provide flood protection to the entire country.
* Recreation. The Corps of Engineers is the nation&#x27;s largest provider of outdoor recreation, operating more than 2,500 recreation areas at 463 projects (mostly lakes) and leasing an additional 1,800 sites to state or local park and recreation authorities or private interests. USACE hosts about 260 million visits a year at its lakes, beaches and other areas, and estimates that 25 million Americans (one in ten) visit a Corps&#x27; project at least once a year. Supporting visitors to these recreation areas generates 600,000 jobs.
* Hydroelectric Power. The Corps of Engineers was first authorized to build hydroelectric plants in the 1920s, and today operates 75 power plants, producing one fourth of the nation&#x27;s hydro-electric power—or three percent of its total electric energy. This makes USACE the fifth largest electric supplier in the United States.
* Shore Protection. With a large proportion of the U.S. population living near our sea and lake shores, and an estimated 75% of U.S. vacations being spent at the beach, there has been Federal interest — and a Corps of Engineers mission — in protecting these areas from hurricane and coastal storm damage.
* Dam Safety. The Corps of Engineers develops engineering criteria for safe dams, and conducts an active inspection program of its own dams.
* Water Supply. The Corps first got involved in water supply in the 1850s, when they built the Washington Aqueduct. Today USACE reservoirs supply water to nearly 10 million people in 115 cities. In the drier parts of the Nation, water from Corps reservoirs is also used for agriculture.
* Water Safety. The Corps of Engineers has taken an interest in recreational water safety, with current initiatives for increasing the use rate of life jackets and preventing the use of alcohol while boating.

===Environment===

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers environmental mission has two major focus areas: restoration and stewardship. The Corps supports and manages numerous environmental programs, that run the gamut from cleaning up areas on former military installations contaminated by hazardous waste or munitions to helping establish/reestablish wetlands that helps endangered species survive. Some of these programs include Ecosystem Restoration, Formerly Used Defense Sites, Environmental Stewardship, EPA Superfund, Abandoned Mine Lands, Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program, Base Realignment and Closure, 2005, and Regulatory.

This mission includes education as well as regulation and cleanup.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has an active environmental program under both its Military and Civil Programs.
The Civil Works environmental mission that ensures all USACE projects, facilities and associated lands meet environmental standards. The program has four functions: compliance, restoration, prevention, and conservation. The Corps also regulates all work in wetlands and waters of the United States.

The Military Programs Environmental Program manages design and execution of a full range of cleanup and protection activities:
* cleans up sites contaminated with hazardous waste, radioactive waste, or ordnance
* complies with federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations
* strives to minimize our use of hazardous materials
* conserves our natural and cultural resources

The following are major areas of environmental emphasis:

* Wetlands and Waterways Regulation and Permitting
* Ecosystem Restoration
* Environmental Stewardship
* Radioactive site cleanup through the Formerly Used Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP)
* Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC)
* Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS)
* Support to EPA&#x27;s Superfund Program

See also Environmental Enforcement below.

=== Sustainability ===
The Army adopted a sustainability policy in the early 2000s to make military bases, and the force as a whole, more resilient and less dependent on fossil fuels. Since the US military is one of the world&#x27;s largest institutional energy consumers, this would have a significant impact on reducing waste, improving efficiency, and ensuring that public resources are used effectively.

The Army has developed and adopted its own triple bottom line framework shifting from the traditional &quot;People Planet, and Profit&quot; to &quot;Mission, Community, and Environment&quot;. To meet these new sustainability targets, it has implemented regulations such as designing all new projects to meet the LEED silver standard. Additional regulations are detailed in the Sustainable Design and Development Policy.

The 2017 revision to the Sustainable Design and Development Policy outlines the updated goals and requirements the Army established in an effort to successfully complete the sustainability mission. Most of these requirements result in stricter regulations on the planning, design and construction of new projects and major renovations:

* Siting and site development
* Energy performance and security
* Indoor and outdoor water use
* Metering, monitoring, and subsystem measurement
* Indoor environmental quality
* Waste and recyclables management
* New and underused technologies
* Commissioning and plans for operation

Many of these goals fall directly onto USACE, as it oversees most construction and maintenance of Army bases and infrastructure. To embrace the branch&#x27;s movement toward sustainability, USACE added sustainability as an overarching mission with several specific focus areas:

* Gaining expertise and becoming a leader in industry technology and advancement; primarily in areas surrounding construction and energy to enable high-performance buildings and civil works projects, as well as energy security
* Planning and implementing a number of approaches to mitigate the potential environmental changes due to the climate crisis specifically with regard to the nation&#x27;s water infrastructure
* Focusing on purchases that further the sustainability mission and prioritizing designs/technology that are recycled, bio-based, or benefit the environment
* Releasing annual Sustainability Report and Implementation Plans for accountability and to track progress toward achieving energy goals

This challenge is not without its difficulties. The first report issued in 2008 showed that 78% of new projects were built to the LEED silver standard (without actually getting the certification) instead of the 100% required. In addition, there was an 8.4% and 32% reduction in energy use intensity and water use, respectively, and a 35% increase in hazardous waste production.

Later reports show some improvement toward resilience and sustainability. The 2020 Sustainability Report and Implementation Plan show a further 12% reduction in water use as well as 35% total reduction in energy use intensity since 2003. Future projections show that USACE intends to continue to build on these focus areas and drive down its demands in areas such as fuel, electricity and water.

==Operational facts and figures==
Summary of facts and figures as of 2007, provided by the Corps of Engineers:
* One HQ, 8 Divisions, 2 Provisional Division, 45 Districts, 6 Centers, one active-duty unit, 2 Engineer Reserve Command
* At work in more than 90 countries
* Supports 159 Army installations and 91 Air Force installations
* Owns and operates 609 dams
* Owns or operates 257 navigation lock chambers at 212 sites
* Largest owner-operator of hydroelectric plants in the US. Owns and operates 75 plants—24% of U.S. hydropower capacity (3% of the total U.S. electric capacity)
* Operates and maintains of commercial inland navigation channels
* Maintains 926 coast, Great Lakes, and inland harbors
* Dredge annually for construction or maintenance
* Nation&#x27;s &quot;number one provider of outdoor recreation&quot; with more than 368 million visits annually to 4,485 sites at 423 USACE projects (383 major lakes and reservoirs)
* Total water supply storage capacity of 
* Average annual damages prevented by Corps flood risk management projects (1995–2004) of $21 billion (see &quot;Civil works controversies&quot; below)
* Approximately 137 environmental protection projects under construction (September 2006 figure)
* Approximately of wetlands restored, created, enhanced, or preserved annually under the Corps&#x27; Regulatory Program
* Approximately $4 billion in technical services to 70 non-DoD Federal agencies annually
* Completed (and continuing work on) thousands of infrastructure projects in Iraq at an estimated cost over $9 billion: school projects (324,000 students), crude oil production , potable water projects (3.9 million people (goal 5.2 million)), fire stations, border posts, prison/courthouse improvements, transportation/communication projects, village road/expressways, railroad stations, postal facilities, and aviation projects. More than 90 percent of the USACE construction contracts have been awarded to Iraqi-owned businesses — offering employment opportunities, boosting the economy, providing jobs, and training, promoting stability and security where before there was none. Consequently, the mission is a central part of the U.S. exit strategy.
* The Corps of Engineers has one of the strongest Small Business Programs in the Army—Each year, approximately 33% of all contract dollars are obligated with Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Women Owned Small Businesses, Historically Underutilized Business Zones, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Jackie Robinson-Burnette was named the Chief of the Corps&#x27; Small Business Program in May 2010. The program is managed through an integrated network of over 60 Small Business Advisors, 8 Division Commanders, 4 Center Directors, and 45 District Commanders.
==Environmental protection and regulatory program==
The regulatory program is authorized to protect the nation&#x27;s aquatic resources. USACE personnel evaluate permit applications for essentially all construction activities that occur in the nation&#x27;s waters, including wetlands. Two primary authorities granted to the Army Corps of Engineers by Congress fall under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (codified in Chapter 33, Section 403 of the United States Code) gave the Corps authority over navigable waters of the United States, defined as &quot;those waters that are subject to the ebb and flow of the tide and/or are presently being used, or have been used in the past, or may be susceptible for use to transport interstate or foreign commerce.&quot; Section 10 covers construction, excavation, or deposition of materials in, over, or under such waters, or any work that would affect the course, location, condition or capacity of those waters. Actions requiring section 10 permits include structures (e.g., piers, wharfs, breakwaters, bulkheads, jetties, weirs, transmission lines) and work such as dredging or disposal of dredged material, or excavation, filling or other modifications to the navigable waters of the United States. The Coast Guard also has responsibility for permitting the erection or modification of bridges over navigable waters of the U.S.

Another of the major responsibilities of the Army Corps of Engineers is administering the permitting program under Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, also known as the Clean Water Act. The Secretary of the Army is authorized under this act to issue permits for the discharge of dredged and fill material in waters of the United States, including adjacent wetlands. The geographic extent of waters of the United States subject to section 404 permits fall under a broader definition and include tributaries to navigable waters and adjacent wetlands. The engineers must first determine if the waters at the project site are jurisdictional and subject to the requirements of the section 404 permitting program. Once jurisdiction has been established, permit review and authorization follows a sequence process that encourages avoidance of impacts, followed by minimizing impacts and, finally, requiring mitigation for unavoidable impacts to the aquatic environment. This sequence is described in the section 404(b)(1) guidelines.

There are three types of permits issued by the Corps of Engineers: Nationwide, Regional General, and Individual. 80% of the permits issued are nationwide permits, which include 50 general type of activities for minimal impacts to waters of the United States, as published in the Federal Register. Nationwide permits are subject to a reauthorization process every 5 years, with the most recent reauthorization occurring in March, 2012. To gain authorization under a nationwide permit, an applicant must comply with the terms and conditions of the nationwide permit. Select nationwide permits require preconstruction notification to the applicable corps district office notifying them of his or her intent, type and amount of impact and fill in waters, and a site map. Although the nationwide process is fairly simple, corps approval must be obtained before commencing with any work in waters of the United States. Regional general permits are specific to each corps district office. Individual permits are generally required for projects that impact greater than of waters of the United States. Individual permits are required for activities that result in more than minimal impacts to the aquatic environment.

==Research==
The Corps of Engineers has two research organizations, the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) and the Army Geospatial Center (AGC).

ERDC provides science, technology, and expertise in engineering and environmental sciences to support both military and civilian customers. ERCD research support includes:
* Dam safety systems
* Mapping and topography terrain analysis
* Infrastructure design, construction, operations and maintenance
* Structural engineering
* Cold-regions science and engineering
* Coastal and hydraulic engineering, producing products such as HEC-RAS
* Environmental quality, including toxic chemistry of bay mud and other dredge spoils
* Geotechnical engineering
* Earthquake engineering
* High performance computing and information technology

AGC coordinates, integrates, and synchronizes geospatial information requirements and standards across the Army and provides direct geospatial support and products to warfighters. See also Geospatial Information Officer.

==Insignia==
The Corps of Engineers branch insignia, the Corps Castle, is believed to have originated on an informal basis. In 1841, cadets at West Point wore insignia of this type. In 1902, the Castle was formally adopted by the Corps of Engineers as branch insignia. The &quot;castle&quot; is actually the Pershing Barracks at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.

A current tradition was established with the &quot;Gold Castles&quot; branch insignia of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, West Point Class of 1903, who served in the Corps of Engineers early in his career and had received the two pins as a graduation gift of his family. In 1945, near the conclusion of World War II, General MacArthur gave his personal pins to his Chief Engineer, General Leif J. Sverdrup. On 2 May 1975, upon the 200th anniversary of the Corps of Engineers, retired General Sverdrup, who had civil engineering projects including the landmark -long Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel to his credit, presented the Gold Castles to then-Chief of Engineers Lieutenant General William C. Gribble, Jr., who had also served under General MacArthur in the Pacific. General Gribble then announced a tradition of passing the insignia along to future Chiefs of Engineers, and it has been done so since.

==Controversies==
===Civil works===
Some of the Corps of Engineers&#x27; civil works projects have been characterized in the press as being pork barrel or boondoggles such as the New Madrid Floodway Project and the New Orleans flood protection. Projects have allegedly been justified based on flawed or manipulated analyses during the planning phase. Some projects are said to have created profound detrimental environmental effects or provided questionable economic benefit such as the Mississippi River–Gulf Outlet in southeast Louisiana. Faulty design and substandard construction have been cited in the failure of levees in the wake of Hurricane Katrina that caused flooding of 80% of the city of New Orleans.

Review of Corps of Engineers&#x27; projects has also been criticized for its lack of impartiality. The investigation of levee failure in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina was sponsored by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) but funded by the Corps of Engineers and involved its employees.

Corps of Engineers projects can be found in all 50 states, and are specifically authorized and funded directly by Congress. Local citizen, special interest, and political groups lobby Congress for authorization and appropriations for specific projects in their area.

Senator Russ Feingold and Senator John McCain sponsored an amendment requiring peer review of Corps projects to the Water Resources Development Act of 2006, proclaiming &quot;efforts to reform and add transparency to the way the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers receives funding for and undertakes water projects.&quot; A similar bill, the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, which included the text of the original Corps&#x27; peer review measure, was eventually passed by Congress in 2007, overriding Presidential veto.

===Military construction===
A number of Army camps and facilities designed by the Corps of Engineers, including the former Camp O&#x27;Ryan in New York State, have reportedly had a negative impact on the surrounding communities. Camp O&#x27;Ryan, with its rifle range, has possibly contaminated well and storm runoff water with lead. This runoff water eventually runs into the Niagara River and Lake Ontario, sources of drinking water to millions of people. This situation is exacerbated by a failure to locate the engineering and architectural plans for the camp, which were produced by the New York District in 1949.

===Greenhouse whistleblower suit===
Bunnatine &quot;Bunny&quot; Greenhouse, a formerly high-ranking official in the Corps of Engineers, won a lawsuit against the United States government in July 2011. Greenhouse had objected to the Corps accepting cost projections from KBR in a no-bid, noncompetitive contract. After she complained, Greenhouse was demoted from her Senior Executive Service position, stripped of her top secret security clearance, and even, according to Greenhouse, had her office booby-trapped with a trip-wire from which she sustained a knee injury. A U.S. District court awarded Greenhouse $970,000 in full restitution of lost wages, compensatory damages, and attorney fees.

<text>Alphesiboea () was the name of several characters in Greek mythology:

*Alphesiboea, mother of Adonis with Phoenix.
*Alphesiboea, a Psophian princess as the daughter of King Phegeus in Arcadia. She was the sister of Axion and Temenus, and married Alcmaeon who was purified by her father for the murder of his mother Eriphyle. Alphesiboea was deserted by her husband for the love of Callirhoe, daughter of the river-god Achelous. In revenge, her brothers Axion and Temenus at the command of their father treacherously slew their brother-in-law. Phegeus was also said to have murdered Alcmaeon himself and also Alphesiboea&#x27;s unnamed daughter. Later on, the widowed sister, Alphesiboea killed her own brothers in revenge of her husbands&#x27;s death. In some versions of this myth, she is called Arsinoe.
*Alphesiboea, a daughter of Bias and Pero, and sister to Aretus and Perialkes. She was the wife of Pelias. This character, however, is usually called Anaxibia or other sources had Phylomache, Minyan daughter of King Amphion of Orchomenus as the spouse of Pelias.
*Alphesiboea, an Indian nymph, who was obsessively coveted by Dionysus, but she refused to yield to his wishes, that is until the god changed himself into a tiger, and thus compelled her by fear of threat to allow him to carry her across the river Sollax, which from this circumstance received the name of Tigris. With him, she eventually became mother of Medes.

<text>Althaea or Althea (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλθαία &quot;Althaía&quot; &quot;healer&quot; from ἀλθαίνω &quot;althaino&quot;, &quot;to cure&quot;, also &quot;a kind of mallow&quot;) was the queen of Calydon in Greek mythology.

== Family ==
Althaea was the daughter of King Thestius and Eurythemis, and was sister to Leda, Hypermnestra, Iphiclus, Euippus. She was also the wife of Oeneus, king of Calydon, and mother of sons, Meleager, Toxeus, Thyreus (Pheres or Phereus), Clymenus, Agelaus (Ageleus), Periphas and daughters, Deianeira, Gorge, Melanippe and Eurymede (the latter two were included in the Meleagrids). According to some writers, Meleager was the result of a liaison with the Greek god Ares, and Deianeira the progeny of Althaea and the god Dionysus. In some accounts, Ancaeus was called her son by the god Poseidon.

== Mythology ==
Althaea is especially remembered in ancient story about the fate of her son Meleager; they became the cause of each other&#x27;s deaths. When Meleager was born, the Moirai (the Fates) predicted he would only live until a brand, burning in the family hearth, was consumed by fire.

:Oeneus and Mars both slept one night with Althaea, daughter of Thestius. When Meleager was born from them, suddenly in the palace the Fates, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, appeared. They thus sang his fate: Clotho said that he would be noble, Lachesis that he would be brave, but Atropos looking at a brand burning on the hearth and said, &quot;He will live only as long as this brand remains unconsumed.&quot; When Althaea, the mother, heard this, she leaped from the bed, put out the fatal brand, and buried it in the midst of the palace, so that it shouldn&#x27;t be destroyed by fire.

In Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Libation Bearers&quot; Althaea is mentioned by the Chorus of captive slaves, serving women of Clytemnestra, in a recollection of &#x27;hatreds that stopped at nothing&#x27;.
:Let anyone whose mind is steady remember this, once he has learned the story of Thestius&#x27; daughter, ruthless Althaea, who killed her own son. She contrived a plot to burn the brand that fate assigned to span his life; it had been kept since the day he came out crying from his mother&#x27;s loins. Deliberately, deceitfully, she set on fire what was to have kept pace with him from birth to death. It glowed bright red before the fire blackened it.

Meleager grew to be a well-respected prince. One spring Oeneus sacrificed the first fruits of the seasons to all the gods, omitting Artemis by mistake. Enraged by the slight, Artemis sent a boar of unnatural size and strength to ruin the land of Calydon. Meleager was one of the warriors who hunted the boar, along with the famous huntress Atalanta and Althaea&#x27;s brothers. Meleager dealt the killing strike to the boar, but gave the skin to Atalanta both because he had fallen in love with her and because she had landed the first and many subsequent blows onto the animal. When Althaea&#x27;s brothers, &quot;thinking scorn that a woman should get the prize in the face of men, took the skin from her, alleging that it belonged to them by right of birth if Meleager did not choose to take it,&quot; Meleager flew into a rage and killed both of his uncles.

When Althaea learned what had happened, she retrieved the brand from where she had concealed it and placed the brand back upon the fire, killing him. Some say that she and Meleager&#x27;s wife Cleopatra later hanged themselves, others that she killed herself with a dagger.

<text>In Greek mythology, Meleager (, ) was a hero venerated in his &quot;temenos&quot; at Calydon in Aetolia. He was already famed as the host of the Calydonian boar hunt in the epic tradition that was reworked by Homer. Meleager is also mentioned as one of the Argonauts.

==Biography==
Meleager was a Calydonian prince as the son of Althaea and the vintner King Oeneus or according to some, of the god Ares. He was the brother of Deianeira, Toxeus, Clymenus, Periphas, Agelaus (or Ageleus), Thyreus (or Phereus or Pheres), Gorge, Eurymede and Melanippe.

Meleager was the father of Parthenopeus by Atalanta but he married Cleopatra, daughter of Idas and Marpessa. They had a daughter, Polydora, who became the bride of Protesilaus, who left her bed on their wedding-night to join the expedition to Troy.

==Mythology==

=== Calydonian boar hunt ===

When Meleager was born, the Moirai (the Fates) predicted he would only live until a piece of wood, then burning in the family hearth, was consumed by fire. Overhearing them, Althaea immediately doused and hid it.

Oeneus sent Meleager to gather up heroes from all over Greece to hunt the Calydonian boar that had been terrorizing the area and rooting up the vines, as Oeneus had omitted Artemis at a festival in which he honored the other gods. In addition to the heroes he required, he chose Atalanta, a fierce huntress, whom he loved. According to one account of the hunt, when Hylaeus and Rhaecus, two centaurs, tried to rape Atalanta, Meleager killed them. Then Atalanta wounded the boar and Meleager killed it. He awarded her the hide since she had drawn the first drop of blood.

Meleager&#x27;s uncles Toxeus, the &quot;archer&quot;, and Plexippus grew enraged that the prize was given to a woman. Meleager killed them in the following argument. He also killed Iphicles and Eurypylus for insulting Atalanta. When Althaea found out that Meleager had killed her brothers, she placed the piece of wood that she had stolen from the Fates (the one that the Fates predicted, once engulfed with fire, would kill Meleager) upon the fire, thus fulfilling the prophecy and killing Meleager, her own son. Meleager&#x27;s sisters who mourned his death excessively were turned into guineafowl (&quot;meleagrides&quot;).

===Afterlife===
In the underworld, his was the only shade that did not flee Heracles, who had come after Cerberus. In Bacchylides&#x27; Ode V, Meleager is depicted as still in his shining armor, so formidable, in Bacchylides&#x27; account, that Heracles reached for his bow to defend himself. Heracles was moved to tears by Meleager&#x27;s account; Meleager had left his sister Deianira unwedded in his father&#x27;s house, and entreated Heracles to take her as his bride; here Bacchylides breaks off his account of the meeting, without noting that in this way Heracles in the underworld chooses a disastrous wife.

According to Pliny the Elder&#x27;s Natural History, Book 37, Chapter 11, Sophocles believed that amber is produced in the countries beyond India, from the tears that are shed for Meleager, by the birds called &quot;meleagrides&quot;.

==Influences==
Among the Romans, the heroes assembled by Meleager for the Calydonian hunt provided a theme of multiple nudes in striking action, to be portrayed frieze-like on sarcophagi.

Meleager&#x27;s story has similarities with the Scandinavian &quot;Norna-Gests þáttr&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, the name Toxeus or Toxius () refers to the following individuals:

*Toxius, son of Caelus (Uranus) who was the inventor of building with clay, it having been suggested to him from swallows&#x27; nests.
*Toxeus, a Pleuronian prince as the son of King Thestius and thus, brother of Althaea. He participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar but was angry that the prize of the boar&#x27;s hide had been given to a woman (Atalanta) by his nephew Meleager, who then killed him in the ensuing argument.
*Toxeus, a Calydonian prince as the son of King Oeneus and Althaea (which makes him a nephew of the above Toxeus). He was the brother of Meleager, Clymenus, Periphas, Agelaus (or Ageleus), Thyreus (or Phereus or Pheres), Deianeira, Gorge, Eurymede and Melanippe. Toxeus was killed by his father for leaping over the trench which had been dug around Calydon. (This is paralleled by Remus overleaping that of Rōmulus. Cf. also the story of Poemander).
*Toxeus, an Oechalian prince as son of King Eurytus and Antiope or Antioche and brother of Clytius and Molion. All three were slain by Heracles. His other siblings were Iole, Deioneus, Didaeon and Iphitos.

<doc id="83188" wikidata="Q3113" url="?curid=83188" title="Allier">
<text>Allier ( , , ; ) is a department in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region that borders Cher to the west, Nièvre to the north, Saône-et-Loire and Loire to the east, Puy-de-Dôme to the south, and Creuse to the south-west. Named after the river Allier, it had a population of 334,872 in 2021. Moulins is the prefecture; Montluçon and Vichy are the subprefectures. Its INSEE and post code is 03.

Before 2018, the inhabitants of the department did not have a demonym. The inhabitants of the department have officially been known in French as &quot;Bourbonnais&quot; since 2018, a reference to the historic province of Bourbonnais. Until then, the unofficial term &quot;Elavérins&quot; had been used.

== Geography ==
Allier department is composed of almost all of the former Duchy of Bourbonnais. It is part of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and it was part of the historical, cultural and administrative region of Auvergne until 2016.

===Principal communes===

The most populous commune is Montluçon; the prefecture Moulins is the third-most populous. As of 2021, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

The department also includes the spa towns Bourbon-l&#x27;Archambault, Néris-les-Bains and Vichy.

=== Relief ===
Bourbonnais bocage covers most of the western and central parts of the department (including the Forest of Tronçais), followed by the Bourbonnais &quot;Sologne&quot; in the east north-east, the Bourbonnais Mountain (near Vichy) which is the highest point of Bourbonnais together with Montoncel (peaking at 1,287 metres), and finally in the south of the department, the Bourbonnais &quot;Limagne&quot;, which extends from Varennes to Gannat, and is the breadbasket of the department.

;The Bourbonnais Bocage
To the north and just over 500 metres above sea level, the Bourbonnais Bocage occupies one-third of the department, with two parts: the centre and the west (for the part between the Val de Cher and western boundaries of the territory). The bocage is especially remarkable for its rich forests and woodlands including the Forest of Tronçais but also the forests of Moladier Bagnolet, Civrais, Soulongis, Grosbois, Dreuille, Lespinasse and Suave.

Almost all of the southern area consists of Combrailles which is sometimes called High Bourbonnais, in an area that goes beyond the departmental boundaries of Creuse and Puy-de-Dôme. This area of the department rises to 778 metres at Bosse. The rivers Sioule, Bouble, and Cher have carved the most picturesque gorges in Allier.

;The Bourbonnais Sologne
To the east, between the Val d&#x27;Allier and the borders of Nièvre and Saône-et-Loire, the Bourbonnais Sologne has a nice balance between pastures, crops, woods and ponds: the balance between agriculture and semi-wilderness constituting a very favorable setting for fauna and flora.

;The Bourbonnais Mountains
In its southern extension, the Bourbonnais Mountain rises from the Puy Saint-Ambroise (442 metres) near Saint-Léon and then extends to the massif of Assise and the Black Woods at the edge of Puy-de-Dôme and Loire which is marked by the Puy de Montoncel (1,287 metres) – the highest point in Allier.

;The Bourbonnais Limagne
Commonly grouped under the name of &quot;Val d&#x27;Allier&quot;, the Limagne and Forterre extend on both sides of the river between Vichy and Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule with an essential quality of fertility. Limogne, together with Sioule and Allier, is part of the Gannat / Escurolles / Saint-Pourçain triangle while Forterre covers the Canton of Varennes-sur-Allier ending near Jaligny.

=== Hydrography ===

;Watercourses:
* to the west: the Cher
* in the centre: the Allier and its tributary the Sioule
* to the east the Loire and its tributary the Besbre

=== Climate ===
A transition zone in the middle of the country, Allier is actually a free zone between north and south. The department is wide open to Atlantic influences and enjoys a mild and humid climate dominated by westerly winds which helps a little to differentiate it from other parts of Auvergne. The weather variances coincide with the diversity of Bourbonnais territory such as: flat regions, low altitude Bourbonnais Sologne and large floodplains, the hill country, the average altitude of 300 to 600 metres, the central part of the department, and the semi-mountainous southern townships bordering the Combraille and Forez between 700 and 1,200 metres.

There are two periods of maximum precipitation in June and October and a minimum in January and February with average of 694 millimetres in Montluçon (altitude 207 metres), 763 mm in Moulins (245 m), 778 mm in Vichy (251 m), 791 mm in Lapalisse (285 m) and nearly 1,200 mm in Assisi (1,050 m). As noted Atlantic winds are dominant from the west, northwest, or southwest. The influence of topography, especially in the valleys of Cher and Allier, also contributes to the south and north variance.

== History ==
The history of Allier corresponds to the Duchy of Bourbon (Bourbonnais) with which it shares almost the entire territory.

Allier is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from parts of the former provinces of Auvergne and Bourbonnais.

In 1940, the government of Marshal Philippe Pétain chose the town of Vichy as its capital. Vichy also became the department&#x27;s second sub-prefecture in 1940, since the department now found itself split by the demarcation line between the occupied and (relatively, at least initially) free zones of France.

=== Heraldry ===
== Demography ==
On 1 January 2017 the population of Allier was estimated at 337,988 inhabitants which represented an average density of 46 people/km2. Many areas have a density less than 20 people/km2. Because of its low population density, it is considered to fall within the empty diagonal.

Since the early 1980s Allier has faced many demographic handicaps. The ratio of older people is important and with low fertility rates the natural growth is negative. Net migration was negative between 1968 and 1999, and slightly positive between 1999 and 2017.

Allier has three major cities: Montluçon, Vichy, and Moulins by size. The rest of the department includes some small towns and villages, scattered mainly along the rivers. The few villages are far from one another, and it is generally a sparsely-populated department. Until the end of the 19th century, however, the population was increasing because the development of its cities (industries at Montluçon and Moulins, spas in Vichy) compensated by the rural exodus. The department then passed 420,000 inhabitants. After losses of the First World War, the population stabilized and grew a little again in the 1960s. Since then, the continuing rural exodus and especially the decline of old industries has made the population decrease and age steadily, from 386,533 inhabitants in 1968 to 337,988 in 2017.

The population of the department is approximately equal of the country of Iceland.

== Politics and administration ==

=== Prefecture ===
Valérie Hatsch is prefect of Allier since 28 March 2022.

Jean-Luc Marx, the prefect of Lot, was named the prefect of Allier on 1 June 2011, replacing Pierre Monzani who was appointed Prefect of Seine-et-Marne on 25 May 2011.

Monzani had been prefect of Allier since 14 January 2009. Born on 12 May 1958 in Villerupt (Meurthe-et-Moselle), he holds a civil service &quot;agrégation&quot; in history and a &quot;DEA&quot; in history and civilization. A former student of the École Normale Supérieure (Saint-Cloud) and of École nationale d&#x27;administration (ENA), since August 2006 he has been director of INHES (National Institute of Advanced Security Studies).

=== Two senators ===
After 2020 Senate elections, the two senators of Allier are Bruno Rojouan and Claude Malhuret.

In the Senate elections in 2008 the left took one of the two Senate seats in Allier formerly held by the right. Mireille Schurch, PCF Mayor of Lignerolles, was elected:

* Gérard Dériot DVD
* Mireille Schurch PCF

=== Representatives in the National Assembly ===
The elections of 2007 returned three Socialists (Bernard Lesterlin for Montluçon, Jean Mallot for Saint-Pourçain, and Guy Chambefort for Moulins) and one PRG (Gérard Charasse for Vichy).

The current representatives are:

=== Departmental Council ===

The current president of the Departmental Council is Claude Riboulet, elected in 2017. In the 2021 departmental election, the Departmental Council of Allier was elected as follows:

In the local elections of March 2008, Allier department was won by a majority of the left. The URB (Republican Union for Bourbonnais, right) had headed the department between 2001 and 2008, with the last year with only one vote majority. From 2008 the left coalition was in control also with a majority of one vote (10 PC, 6 PS, 2 PRG, 18 seats in total), facing 17 councilors from the URB.

=== History of the left in Allier ===
The department was distinguished by communist votes in early voting which continued until after the Second World War with the two major political parties of the left being the PCF and the SFIO which have now become the Socialist Party.

The small town of Commentry has the distinction of being the first town in France to elect a socialist mayor in 1882: Christophe Thivrier. Another local figure, Pierre Brizon, an MP in 1910, was typically a member for sharecroppers.

Earlier, Ledru-Rollin achieved a very good result in 1848 (14%) with Democratic and socialist candidates in the following year (44% of the vote, against 35% for all of France). Similarly, resistance to the coup of 2 December 1851 was important after an attempt to support the uprising in June 1849. Republicans were in the majority in 1876 and held all six parliamentary seats. After neighbouring results of 15% of enrolled voters from 1893 to 1906 the Socialists rose to 31% of enrolled votes (42% of those cast) in 1910 and maintained this in 1914

Allier remains a land of rural communism (still 14.66% in the 2004 regional elections – the second best result for the party after Somme) in a sometimes difficult cohabitation with the Socialist Party.

For the causes of their success it may be noted that historically Allier has been a department where vast properties were combined into sharecropping. Sharecropping only spread in the 15th century and was not disturbed by the sale of national assets to the Revolution. In the 19th century large properties (100 hectares or more) occupied about half of the land, and even more than 70% in the north of the department. In the south, small properties dominate.

Sharecropping continued as a form of land development and it involved 40% of the land in 1892 (only 7% overall for France). Adverse conditions made sharecroppers promote the creation of rural unions between 1904 and 1911 (the third greatest number per department in France after Hérault and Landes). Despite poor results the mobilization was important and promoted the election of left-wing candidates.

== Economy ==
The industries most represented are the food industry, wood and furniture, chemical, foundries and metalworking, rubber, machinery and electrical equipment, automotive, weaponry, textiles, building, and the spas.

According to studies by INSEE agriculture would be about 7 to 8% of departmental gross domestic product.

== Tourism ==
Marked by the imprint of the Dukes of Bourbon, Allier is a land of rivers, bocage, and small mountains. Landscapes such as Bourbonnais bocage, the gorges of the Sioule, and the Forest of Tronçais are places suitable for the practice of outdoor activities: hiking, fishing, and white water sports. Hydrotherapy is one of the leading sectors of Bourbonnais tourism with the international spa at Vichy.

This nature preserve also features over 500 castles, Romanesque churches and a number of houses which represent the heritage of the Bourbons. Bourbon cuisine reflects the history of the province and provides a number of local products, including Pâté aux pommes de terre, Charolais beef, wines from Saint-Pourçain AOC, Charroux mustard, and Vichy pastilles.

Among the tourist sites to visit are:
;Monuments:
* the Château de La Palice and its Renaissance chambered ceilings,
* the &quot;Bourbon-l&#x27;Archambault Castle&quot;, &quot;Cradle of the Bourbons&quot;

;Churches and abbeys:
* Moulins Cathedral and the triptych of the Virgin in glory
* the &quot;Priory Church of Saint Peter&quot; at Souvigny, more commonly called the &quot;Saint-Denis&quot; of the Bourbons
* the Abbey of Saint Vincent de Chantelle

;Museums:
* The &quot;National Centre of Stage Costume&quot;
* Maison Mantin in Moulins

;Activities:
* &quot;Le Pal&quot;, an amusement and animal park in Dompierre-sur-Besbre
* &quot;Paleopolis&quot; in Gannat, a site designed to understand life sciences and the earth through paleontology
* Three cities stand out:
* Moulins for its historical heritage from the 15th century
* Montluçon, a medieval and festive city dominated by its castle
* Vichy, an important spa town.

== Gastronomy and viticulture ==

The pâté aux pommes de terre is one of the specialities of the Allier, as well as of the neighboring Limousin region. The river Allier is one of the rare places in Southern Europe where the freshwater grayling (&quot;Thymallus thymallus&quot;), known in French as &quot;ombre des rivières&quot;, occurs in a natural habitat. This fish is much valued in French gastronomy for its fine and delicate texture and is best eaten along with a light wine.

&quot;Pompe aux grattons&quot; or &quot;brioche aux griaudes&quot;, a kind of brioche-like bread with cracklings, is a specialty of the Bourbonnais.

Saint-Pourçain AOC wine is produced in Allier and the oak from the forest of Tronçais is one of the most favoured in the construction of wine barrels.

=== Second homes ===
In 2020 the quantity of dwellings in the department which were second homes was 7.2%. The table below shows the main communes of Allier with second homes and which exceed 10% of total housing.

The department has attracted many foreigners, English, Belgian, Swiss, and Dutch, and they have acquired many second homes. Therefore many communes have become &quot;European&quot;, such as Pouzy-Mésangy, which today has many English and Swiss residents.

== Culture ==

=== Sister Regions ===
The Conseil Départemental of Allier co-operates with the following foreign administrative units:

* Niafunké (Mali) since 1988.
* Khemisset (Morocco) since 2009.
* Övörkhangai (Mongolia) since 2000.
* Cluj (Romania) since 2002.
* M&#x27;bour Department (Senegal) since 2016.
* Nguékhokh (Senegal) since 2002.

=== Regional languages ===
Allier is traversed by the border between Occitan and French.

For a long period the people of Allier did not speak standard French but one of the following local languages:

* Bourbonnais: Dialect oïl, north of a line from Montluçon to Saint-Pourçain-sur-Sioule to Lapalisse
* Auvergnat: (a dialect of Occitan) in the extreme south
* the area between the two, sometimes called &quot;Bourbon d&#x27;oc&quot; is part of the &quot;Occitan Crescent&quot;, an area of mixing of French and Occitan considered by most linguists as Occitan with French pronunciation. Some consider the speech of the Crescent to be a full Occitan dialect and use the term &quot;Marchois&quot;.

Qualifications:

* Note that in the south-east of the department (notably in Forterre and the Bourbonnais Mountain) the influence of Francoprovencal arises.
* Similarly, in the north-west (and especially in the old part of the Bourbonnais department of Cher to Saint-Amand-Montrond), the Bourbon dialects are close to the Berrichon dialect.

<text>Hautes-Alpes (; ; ) is a department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of Southeastern France. It is located in the heart of the French Alps, after which it is named. Hautes-Alpes had a population of 141,220 as of 2019, which makes it the third least populated French department. Its prefecture is Gap; its sole subprefecture is Briançon. Its INSEE and postal code is 05.

== History ==
Hautes-Alpes is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It consists of the southeast of the former province of Dauphiné and the north of Provence. At the time when the department was created, the two mountain communes of La Grave and Villar-d&#x27;Arêne successfully campaigned to be included in Hautes-Alpes and not in the neighbouring department of Isère to which they had originally been assigned. This was because they hoped to benefit from the relative autonomy and certain fiscal privileges enjoyed by the region since the 14th century under the terms of the Statute of the Briançon Escartons.

Napoleon passed through Gap when he returned to reclaim France after his exile on Elba using what is now known as Route Napoléon. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, the department was occupied by Austrian and Piedmontese troops from 1815 to 1818.

During World War II, Italy occupied Hautes-Alpes from November 1942 to September 1943.

== Geography ==

The department is surrounded by the following French departments: Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Drôme, Isère and Savoie. Italy borders it on the east with the Metropolitan City of Turin and the province of Cuneo, region of Piedmont.

Hautes-Alpes is located in the Alps mountain range. The average elevation is over 1000 m; the highest elevation is over 4000 m. The only three sizable cities are Gap, Briançon and Embrun, which was a subprefecture until 1926.

The third-highest settlement in all of Europe is the Hautes-Alpes village of Saint-Véran. Gap and Briançon are the highest prefecture and subprefecture in France, respectively.

The following rivers flow through the department: Durance, Guisane, Buëch, Drac and Clarée. The Durance has been dammed to create one of the largest artificial lakes in Western Europe: the Lac de Serre-Ponçon. The Queyras valley is located in the eastern part of the department and is noted by many as being an area of outstanding beauty.

===Principal communes===
The most populous commune is the prefecture Gap. As of 2019, there are 2 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants, and 6 communes with more than 3,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
The inhabitants of the department are called &quot;Haut-Alpins&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Haut-Alpines&quot; (feminine) in French.

The extremely mountainous terrain explains the sparse population, which was about 120,000 in 1791. It changed little during the 19th century, but fell to about 85,000 after World War I. Thanks in large part to tourism, the population has risen from 87,436 in 1962 to 141,107 in 2016, principally in the town of Gap.

Population development since 1791:

==Politics==
===Departmental Council of Hautes-Alpes===
The President of the Departmental Council of Hautes-Alpes has been Jean-Marie Bernard of The Republicans since the 2015 departmental elections.

===Members of the National Assembly===
Hautes-Alpes elected the following members of the National Assembly in the 2017 legislative election:

== Tourism ==
The tourist industry is largely dependent on skiing in winter. In summer the Alpine scenery and many outdoor activities attract visitors from across Europe (sailing, hiking, climbing and aerial sports such as gliding). The Tour de France passes through the department regularly. This draws many cycling fanatics to cycle the cols and watch the race.

<doc id="83191" wikidata="Q122818613" url="?curid=83191" title="Amphinomus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Amphinomus (; &quot;Amphínomos&quot;; literally &quot;grazing all about&quot;) may refer to the following personages:

* Amphinomus, the Aetolian father of Thyrie (Hyria) who became the mother of Cycnus by Apollo.
* Amphinomus, a prince of Dulichium as the son of King Nisos. He was one of the suitors of Penelope and was considered the best-behaved of them. Despite Odysseus&#x27;s warning, Amphinomus was compelled by Athena to stay, as he had been a suitor nonetheless. He was killed by a spear thrown by Telemachus during the Ithaca massacre; ironically, Amphinomus had twice tried to dissuade the suitors from killing Telemachus.
* Amphinomus, son of Diomedes and the daughter of King Daunus of Apulia in Italy.
* Amphinomus, brother of Anapias (named in latin: &quot;Pii Fratres&quot;, ): they are legendary characters of the Greek Catania (Sicily, Italy), who saved their parents from an eruption of Etna, carrying them on their shoulders.

There was also a Greek geometer called Amphinomus. He is thought to have flourished in the fourth century BC, but is otherwise unknown. He is mentioned a few times by Proclus in his &quot;Commentary on the First Book of Euclid&#x27;s Elements&quot;.

<doc id="83193" wikidata="Q5306021" url="?curid=83193" title="Drawbridge mentality">
<text>Drawbridge mentality, also known as fortress mentality is a conservative and anti-immigrant attitude of prior immigrants in an established community. Drawbridge mentality can encompass denying immigration to people, businesses and also denying building developments which could facilitate immigration, such as affordable housing. The conflict of drawbridge mentality often emerges between city councils which wish to expand, and residents concerned about losing property value or other economic or political assets.

It is often unclear whether the intention of certain policies is to achieve a drawbridge mentality, or if the policies have other economic or political goals. For example, impact fees reduce immigration by raising entry costs, but can also be argued to offset lowering property taxes. The drawbridge mentality can allow governments or communities to avoid providing humanitarian aid to immigrants by denying responsibility entirely. 

The term can imply a selfish attitude and can be taken as an insult, and it often overlaps with the Not in My Back Yard attitude. The drawbridge mentality is one of many ways in which residents can respond to change, viewed as conservatively preserving the existing status quo. 

There are many different reasons for immigration, for example due to ecological collapse by droughts and famine caused by physical and climate changes, floods, cyclones, and other natural disasters. There are also other economic and political factors motivating immigration. However, drawbridge mentality not generally concerned about the reason for immigration. Instead, the main focus is on social and economic effects of immigration like the changing urban density, property values, predominant lifestyles and cultures, and whether these changes are desirable for existing residents.

== Examples ==

=== Eli Home in Anaheim Hills, California ===
Eli Home, a nonprofit organisation founded in the 1980s which maintains homeless shelters for abused children, tried to expand to Anaheim Hills in 1994. The organisation was endorsed and praised by former United States presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, but Anaheim Hills community residents were strongly opposed to the decision, and tried to stop the development. The Not in My Back Yard attitude was the main reasoning for the opposition, suggesting that the shelter will increase crime rates and make neighborhoods less friendly. The development was nonetheless approved by the council and later led to an exodus of Anaheim Hills residents. Since then, Eli Home as an organisation claims to serve over 1,000 abused children and their families annually, and also expanded services to drug rehabilitation, although the organisation had low donations in the decades since.

=== Acton, Massachusetts ===
In 2020, the Housing Production Plan for Acton, Massachusetts was released by the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development, which detailed the methods to achieve at least 10% of its housing be designated &#x27;affordable&#x27; as according to legislation set in 2008. Boston, which Acton is a suburb of, experiences significant racial disparity due to redlining, an issue reported to have gradually increased since the late 1960s. Negative racial stereotypes have been used to justify these redlining practices, but in the case of Acton it is believed these policies are mainly motivated by &quot;the indifference of average citizens&quot; and that the drawbridge mentality is considered a rational response to maintain property value. In this perspective, it is unclear whether the drawbridge mentality was an unintended effect of maintaining property value or nature preservation, or if isolating the community from immigrants was the primary goal.

<text>Antenor (, &quot;Antḗnōr&quot;;  BC) was an Athenian sculptor. He is recorded as the creator of the joint statues of the tyrannicides Harmodius and Aristogeiton funded by the Athenians on the expulsion of Hippias. These statues were carried away to Susa by Xerxes I of Persia during the Greco-Persian Wars. Archaeologists have also established that a basis signed by &quot;Antenor son of Eumares&quot; belonged to a set of female figures in an archaic style which were displayed in the acropolis. The sculptor of the &quot;Harmodius and Aristogeiton&quot; is usually listed as the son of Euphranor.

<doc id="83199" wikidata="Q576170" url="?curid=83199" title="Anticlea">
<text>In Greek mythology, Anticlea or Anticlia (; Ancient Greek: &quot;Ἀντίκλεια&quot;, literally &quot;without fame&quot;) was a queen of Ithaca as the wife of King Laërtes.

== Family ==
Anticlea was the daughter of Autolycus and Amphithea. The divine trickster and messenger of the gods, Hermes, was her paternal grandfather. Anticlea was the mother of Odysseus by Laërtes (though some say by Sisyphus). Ctimene was also her daughter by her husband Laertes.

== Mythology ==

=== Early years ===
According to Callimachus, when she was young, Anticlea served the goddess Artemis, and accompanied her in hunting, bearing arrow and quiver.

According to some later sources, including a fragment of Aeschylus&#x27; lost tragedy &quot;The Judgment of Arms&quot;, Odysseus was the child of Anticlea by Sisyphus, not Laërtes. In this version of the story, Autolycus, an infamous trickster, stole Sisyphus&#x27; cattle. At some point, Sisyphus recognized his cattle while on a visit to Autolycus and subsequently seduced Anticlea, Autolycus&#x27; daughter. Odysseus was the result of this union, which took place before Anticlea&#x27;s marriage to Laërtes. When Anticlea was brought to a place about the Alalcomeneum in Boeotia, she delivered Odysseus. Later on, her son called the city of Ithaca by the same name, to renew the memory of the place in which he had been born.

===&quot;Odyssey&quot;===
In Book XI of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus makes a trip to the underworld to seek the advice of the dead prophet Tiresias. In the underworld, he encounters many spirits, among them is that of his mother, Anticlea. Initially, he rebuffs her since he is waiting for the prophet to approach.

After speaking with Tiresias, however, Odysseus allows his mother to come near and lets her speak. She asks him why he is in the underworld while alive, and he tells her about his various troubles and failed attempts to get home. Then he asks her how she died and inquires about his family at home. She tells him that she died of grief, longing for him while he was at war. Anticlea also says that Laërtes (Odysseus&#x27; father) &quot;grieves continually&quot; for Odysseus and lives in a hovel in the countryside, clad in rags and sleeping on the floor. Anticlea further describes the condition of Odysseus&#x27; wife Penelope and son Telemachus.

Penelope has not yet remarried but is overwhelmed with sadness and longing for her husband while Telemachus acts as magistrate for Odysseus&#x27; properties. Odysseus attempts to embrace his mother three times but discovers that she is incorporeal, and his arms simply pass through her. She explains that this is how all ghosts are, and he expresses great sorrow.

In some accounts, Anticleia killed herself on hearing a false report about her son from Nauplius.

The encounter between Odysseus and his mother in the underworld is also the concept of a work by the Northern Irish poet Michael Longley, titled &quot;Anticleia&quot;.

<doc id="83200" wikidata="Q463107" url="?curid=83200" title="Autolycus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Autolycus (; Ancient Greek: Αὐτόλυκος &quot;Autolykos&quot; &#x27;the wolf itself&#x27;) was a successful robber who had the power to metamorphose or make invisible the things he stole. He had his residence on Mount Parnassus and was renowned among men for his cunning and oaths. 

==Family==
There are a number of different accounts of the birth of Autolycus. According to most, he was the son of Hermes and Chione or Philonis. In Ovid&#x27;s version, Autolycus was conceived after Hermes had intercourse with the virgin Chione. Pausanias instead states that Autolycus&#x27; real father was Daedalion. In some accounts, his mother was also called Telauge.

Depending on the source, Autolycus was the husband of Mestra (who could change her shape at will and was a daughter of Erysichthon), or of Neaera, or of Amphithea. He became the father of Anticlea (who married Laertes of Ithaca and was the mother of Odysseus) and several sons, of whom only Aesimus, father of Sinon was named. Autolycus&#x27; other daughter was Polymede, mother of Jason, the famous Argonaut who led a group of men to find the coveted Golden Fleece.

== Mythology ==

=== Adventures ===
According to &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, Autolycus was counted as one of the Argonauts.

Autolycus obtained most of the same skills that his supposed father Hermes possesses, such as the arts of theft and trickery. It was said that he &quot;loved to make white of black, and black of white, from a hornless animal to a horned one, or from horned one to a hornless&quot;. He was given the gift that his thievery could not be caught by anyone.

Autolycus, master of thievery, was also well known for stealing Sisyphus&#x27; herd right from underneath him – Sisyphus, who was commonly known for being a crafty king that killed guests, seduced his niece and stole his brothers&#x27; throne and was banished to the throes of Tartarus by the gods. However, according to other versions of the myth, Autolycus failed to steal Sisyphus&#x27; herd and the king banished him from his city. 

Heracles, the great Greek hero, was taught the art of wrestling by Autolycus. However, Autolycus was a source of trouble in Heracles&#x27; life, because when Autolycus stole some cattle from Euboea and Eurytus, they accused Heracles of the deed; upon going mad from these accusations, Heracles killed them and another one of Eurytus&#x27; sons, Iphitus. This led to Heracles serving three years of punishment to repent the deed.

=== Odysseus&#x27; name ===
Through Anticleia, Autolycus was also the grandfather of the famous warrior Odysseus, and he was responsible for the naming of the child as well. This happened when the nurse of the child Eurycleia &quot;laid the child upon his knees and spoke, and addressed him: Autolycus, find now thyself a name to give to thy child&#x27;s own child; be sure he has long been prayed for&quot;. Then Autolycus answered: &quot;Since I have been angered (ὀδυσσάμενος &quot;odyssamenos&quot;) with many, both men and women, let the name of the child be Odysseus&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Although not as well known as many other Greek mythological figures, Autolycus has appeared in works of fiction.

* Autolycus appears as a paragon of thievery in Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s &quot;On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts&quot;.
* A comic thief in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; boasts that he is named after Autolycus and, like the latter&#x27;s father, Mercury/Hermes, is &quot;a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Philammon (Ancient Greek: Φιλάμμων) was an excellent musician, a talent he received from his father Apollo.

== Family ==
Philammon&#x27;s mother was either Chione (or Philonis), daughter of Daedalion, or Leuconoe, daughter of Eosphoros, or Chrysothemis, daughter of Carmanor of Crete. By Argiope, a nymph of Mount Parnassos, he had Thamyris.

== Mythology ==
Philammon was unnaturally beautiful and thus, one of the nymphs (Argiope) seduced the youth and became pregnant. But Philammon refused to take her into his house as his wife and for being ashamed of the pregnancy, the girl left the Peloponnese and came to the Akte (shore) where she gave birth to a boy, Thamyris.

Philammon was said to have established the tradition of the hymns celebrating the births of Artemis and Apollo, written by himself, being performed by choruses of girls at Delphi. He was the second winner of the most ancient singing contest at Delphi, after Chrysothemis and before his son Thamyris. Some ascribe to him the foundation of the Lernaean mysteries. He was also reported to have been among the Argonauts.

<text>In Greek mythology, Antiphus or Ántiphos (; Ancient Greek: Ἄντιφος) is a name attributed to multiple individuals:

*Antiphus, a Phthian prince as the son of King Myrmidon and Peisidice, and brother of Actor. He may be the same with Antippus, the father of Hippea who became the mother of Polyphemus, Caeneus and Ischys by Elatus, king of the Lapiths.
*Antiphus, the Thespian son of Heracles and Laothoe, daughter of King Thespius of Thespiae. Antiphus and his 49 half-brothers were born of Thespius&#x27; daughters who were impregnated by Heracles in one night, for a week or in the course of 50 days while hunting for the Cithaeronian lion. Later on, the hero sent a message to Thespius to keep seven of these sons and send three of them in Thebes while the remaining forty, joined by Iolaus, were dispatched to the island of Sardinia to found a colony.
*Antiphus, a defender of Thebes in the war of the Seven against Thebes who was killed by Amphiaraus and Apollo.
*Antiphus, son of Thessalus, the son of Heracles, and Chalciope. With his brother Pheidippus, Antiphus lead the forces of Calydnae, Cos, Carpathus, Casus and Nisyrus on the side of the Greeks against Troy. He was also believed to have invaded a region of Greece that he named Thessaly after his father.
*Antiphus, a Trojan prince as one of the 50 sons of King Priam and son of Hecuba. During the Trojan War, he killed Leucus, and later was killed by Agamemnon. In another account, Antiphus and his brothers, Agavus, Agathon, and Glaucus, were all slain by Ajax, son of Telamon.
*Antiphus of Maeonia, son of Talaemenes and brother of Mesthles; both he and his brother were allies of Priam in the Trojan War.
*Antiphus, son of Aegyptius and brother of Eurynomus. He was a Greek commander who sailed from Troy with Odysseus. Having previously escaped death at the hand of Eurypylus (son of Telephus), Antiphos was devoured by Polyphemus.
*Antiphus, an old friend of the house of Odysseus.

The name Antiphus is not to be confused with Antiphōs (Ἀντίφως), which refers to a soldier in the army of the Seven against Thebes who killed Chromis but was himself killed by Hypseus.

<text>Ardennes () is a department in the region of northeastern France named after the broader Ardennes. Its prefecture is the town Charleville-Mézières. The department has 270,582 inhabitants. The inhabitants of the department are known as or .

== Geography ==
=== Political geography ===
The department of Ardennes is bounded by Aisne to the west, Marne to the south, Meuse to the east and Belgium (Provinces of Namur, Luxembourg and Hainaut) to the north.

=== Human geography===
The district is crossed in its northern part by the winding Meuse valley where most people live and activities are focused. Charleville-Mézières and Sedan are the main urban centres.

It is in the catchment of the Academy of Reims and the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal of Reims.

The statistical code and Post Code prefix is 08.

=== Physical geography ===
Ardennes is part of the Ardennes, a plateau deeply cut by the Meuse and its many tributaries which reach into Wallonia in Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany (Eifel), and the north of the neighbouring department of Meuse.

Covering , the department was the smallest among the four contributors to Champagne-Ardenne. It is diverse in climate, topography, natural vegetation and land use, which is a mixture of forest and arable farming.

The highest point is 504 m, on the southern slopes of the Croix Scaille shared by French commune Les Hautes-Rivières and the Belgian commune of Gedinne.

It is in this part of the Ardennes mountains or high hills that the Meuse winds through, known locally as &quot;the valley&quot;. Flowing into the northern part of the department, it waters the main cities of Sedan, Charleville-Mézières, and Nouzonville. It has numerous tributaries – the main ones locally being the Semois and the Chiers.

As to the south, the Aisne flows through the vast near-treeless plain of Champagne chalk (historically by the landed class and bourgeoisie disparaged as flea-ridden Champagne) extended to the south-west by the small, grain-growing Porcien, Thiérache in the west and Argonne in the east are fringe grasslands with very distinctive upper soils.

=== Climate ===
The department does not have a uniform climate throughout its territory, especially most winters.

From the north near Aisne and the border with Belgium, through the centre near the canton of Omont, to the south of the valley of the Meuse, the climate is considered &quot;degraded continental&quot; (heavy rainfall in autumn and frequent frosts in winter). The rest of the department has a &quot;degraded oceanic&quot; or &quot;temperate continental&quot; climate (relative to an oceanic climate, the winters are colder and the summers are hotter, rainfall in the lowlands is lower and winds are of lower strength). All this stems from location, midway between the English Channel, the North Sea and parts of the continent relatively far from any sea.

Winter can be as cold as inner continental lowland Europe some winters and quite often snowier, particularly near main settlements Rocroi, Givet and Sedan in the north.

This climatic difference is particularly pronounced in the presence of frost especially in the valleys of the Meuse, Semoy, the plateau of Rocroi, and around the Croix-Scaille where it can be very marked and persists longer in the year with great influence on vegetation.

Across lands further west and south frontal zones (affecting air and precipitation) are tempered more by the English Channel, Bay of Biscay and North Sea; nearby seeing quite flat terrain – isolated small ranges or lower regions of hills, excluding the mountains across much of the south-eastern third of France.

== Demography ==
=== The evolution and distribution of the population ===
Despite a high birth rate (the highest rate in France in 1968), the department continues to lose population: 275,371 in 2016 due to high unemployment (hence &quot;migration&quot; continues). The two world wars have each time resulted in a loss of population (such as the &quot;exodus&quot; of 1940). There were 330,000 people at the end of the 19th century.

That the major urban areas of the department are the most affected is characterized by a stagnation of the population – a population decline of up to 2% compared to 1999 in the city centres and suburbs (Charleville-Mézières, Revin, Fumay, Givet, Rethel).

The communes, however, are gaining inhabitants (the phenomenon of urban sprawl). This is explained by the search for better living in the countryside which matches the desire of many people to build a small land-holding, typically a house with land to the detriment of their proximity to their workplace. This highly contemporary concept favours commuting between Home and Work. This is the phenomenon of suburbanization which has become common in the whole of France from which Ardennes does not escape.

On 1 January 2006, the Ardennes population stood at 295,653 inhabitants. The population is declining in urban areas but five times less than in rural areas. The limited decline in the urban space where two-thirds of the Ardennes people live is the result of two opposite dynamics. Semi-urban communes have gained 0.5% of inhabitants per year over the period 1999–2006 at the expense of urban centres (downtown and suburbs) which lost 0.6% per year. For thirty years the population has lagged in the main cities of Ardennes. Between 1999 and 2006, the annual decline was 0.2% for Sedan and Rethel, 1.8% for Revin, and 1% for Charleville-Mézières. The most unfavourable rural population change came from degradation of rural employment centres, such as Fumay or Vouziers and to a lesser extent that of their periphery. This was slightly mitigated by a small increase in population in other rural communes.

=== Main towns ===
The most populous commune is the prefecture Charleville-Mézières. As of 2019, there are seven communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:


== History ==
The department is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790 under the Act of 22 December 1789. It includes part of the former provinces of Champagne and Argonne, several principalities including those of Arches and Sedan, countships (such as Rethel), and different areas returned to France (from the former Spanish Netherlands) in the 18th century.

On 12 May 1793, the department expanded itself with the Bailiwick of Liège, Couvin, and the countships from the Holy Roman Empire of Fagnolle and on 26 October 1795 a part of the Duchy of Bouillon.

After the victory of the allies in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, the second Treaty of Paris subtracted territory from Ardennes to attach to the Netherlands: Duchy of Bouillon, Couvin, Mariembourg, Fagnolle, and Philippeville. In addition, the department was occupied by Prussian troops from June 1815 to November 1818.

On 2 September 1870, Sedan was the place of surrender for Napoleon III at the Battle of Sedan against the troops of the Prussian states, a coalition commanded by Helmut von Moltke. The King of Prussia Wilhelm I, the future emperor of the Imperial Germany, and Bismarck viewed the battle from the hills overlooking Sedan. The defeat marked the end of the Second Empire, and at the same time the birth of the French Third Republic on 4 September 1870.
During the two world wars, for strategic reasons, the region each time became the passage for the invading armies because of the narrow width of the Meuse and its deep valley. The French military believed that the region was defended by its terrain and thick forests present in the northern of the department and so neglected the defence of the territory. During the First World War, the Battle of the Ardennes was fought in the department, and Charleville-Mézières became the headquarters of the German Crown Prince. It was at Vouziers and other places that the Czechoslovak legions fought, and it was also near the same city that the aeroplane of Roland Garros was shot down.

It was the only French department to have been fully occupied during that conflict, except for northern Lorraine (Moselle) and Alsace, which had been under German administration since 1871.

During the Second World War, the main effort of the German army was again focused on this area, especially on the right bank of the River Meuse, symbolized by the breakthrough at Sedan which would lead the French troops into the strategic trap the Yellow Plan designed by General von Manstein and approved by Hitler.

It is in this department that the Maginot Line ended: the last fort of the line (Fort Villy la Ferte) was located about five kilometres from Carignan. The French General staff did not want to continue the line of defence along the border with Belgium, a neutral and friendly country. Furthermore, they hoped that the unique geography and the forest would stop the German army.

After the armistice of 1940, Ardennes was declared a &quot;forbidden zone&quot; (actually a German settlement area) throughout the occupation by the Nazi army.

In 1944, the Battle of the Bulge was fought partly in this department.

=== Etymology ===
The name of the department is related to the toponym &quot;Ardenne&quot; which could derive from the Gallic &quot;ardu&quot; meaning &quot;high&quot;. It would have been transformed into &quot;Arduenna&quot; by the Romans to designate the ancient Ardennes forest and the mountains mentioned by Julius Caesar in the work attributed to him: &quot;Commentaries on the Gallic War&quot;. &quot;Arduenna Sylva&quot; was used for the pine forest on the plateau of Bastogne. It was then transformed into &quot;Ardenna&quot; in the 6th century.

This toponym is absent from the names of communes in the department of Ardennes while those of Argonne (Beaumont-en-Argonne), Porcien (Château-Porcien, Novion-Porcien, Chaumont-Porcien, and even Champagne (Vaux-Champagne) are sometimes fused and all have a connotation of regional belonging. This is why the name of &quot;Ardenne&quot; is not specific to the department as it is found in many other parts of France – for example in western and central-western France, Belgium, and Luxembourg where it has its usual sense – from Celtic origin – of &quot;high&quot;, &quot;high woods&quot; or &quot;forest&quot;.

=== Heraldry ===
== Administration ==

=== Administrative organization ===
The seat of the prefecture of the department is at Charleville-Mézières and the three sub-prefectures are Rethel, Sedan, and Vouziers. Rocroi was also a sub-prefecture until 1926. In addition, the departmental seat of the &quot;General Council of Ardennes&quot; is located at Charleville-Mézières.

=== Territorial organization ===
The Ardennes is composed of 452 communes which are grouped into 19 cantons and four arrondissements of varying sizes.

The largest arrondissement of the department is that of Charleville-Mézières while the smallest is Sedan which is half the size. The two arrondissements that occupy the northern part of the Ardennes, however, have four-fifths of the departmental population.

The other two arrondissements, Rethel and Vouziers, occupy the southern part of the department with roughly comparable areas but are very sparsely populated.

Before the Poincaré decree of 10 September 1926 which removed many sub-prefectures in France, the department had five arrondissements. In addition to the four mentioned above, the fifth was that of Rocroi – a small historic city in the north-west of the department close to Belgium – which has been since annexed in its entirety to the district of Charleville-Mézières. The former arrondissement of Rocroi then consisted of six cantons – including four on the border with Belgium – which were Givet, Fumay, Revin, Rocroi, Rumigny, and Signy-le-Petit.

Under the intercommunality framework, Ardennes consists of an urban community organized around the city préfecture, called &quot;Heart of Ardennes&quot; and has fifteen communities of communes including in Sedan the &quot;Communauté de communes du Pays sedanais&quot; which is the most important.

In addition, the Ardennes has 33 communes that do not adhere to any Intercommunal cooperative organisation (EPCI).

== Politics ==
The President of the Departmental Council is Noël Bourgeois of The Republicans.

== Economy ==
The economy of the department, after previously resting on agriculture (forestry and livestock – crops are poor), has been based for over a century now on industry (now in a difficult position) and the services sector, although the proportion of the Ardennes labour force working in this sector is lower than the national average. At the beginning of the 19th century, the region was the largest in France for metal working using charcoal. There was no coal found in the department (only slate from Fumay was usable) but the metallurgical industry developed there (bolts, screws, nails). The railway with many branches (&quot;Compagnie des chemins de fer des Ardennes&quot; from the Sellière family which merged with the Compagnie de l&#x27;Est) accelerated the industrialization at the end of the 19th century in Charleville, Sedan (which had its trams), and Revin. The newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Usine ardennaise&quot; (The Ardennes Factory) became &quot;L&#x27;Usine nouvelle&quot; (The New Factory). The crisis in the 1970s precipitated the decline of metallurgical activity in the department (the blast furnace and small workshops closed one after the other: Blagny, Vireux-Molhain, Murtin-et-Bogny, etc.). Today there are still many subcontractors for the railway industry (TGV for example) and the car industry (GMC, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Mercedes-Benz, among others), Hermès has recently installed themselves at Murtin-et-Bogny, PSA Peugeot Citroën is installed at Les Ayvelles. There is also a nuclear site – the Chooz Nuclear Power Plant with several reactors including the first pressurized water reactor (REP) in France. Agriculture has grown considerably using industrial techniques (wheat, maize, sugar beet).

There are direct TGV trains from the Gare de l&#x27;Est in Paris to Charleville-Mézières (1h 35 m), Sedan, and several TGV trains to Reims with a change for Charleville-Mézières.

A &quot;Y&quot; road has also been set up with the A4 Reims-Paris, the A34 (freeway), and the links to Lille and Brussels which need to take the N5 to join the motorway ring of Charleroi. Similarly, the junction with the highway leading to Luxembourg and Cologne needs to use a portion of highway in France. Improved means of land communication (TGV and A34 motorway) provides the benefit of relative proximity to Paris, Reims, Metz and Belgian cities such as Liège, Charleroi and Brussels.

Every year in September, the Sedan fair is a big shopping event (2nd in the region) which attracts about 250,000 people each year.

== Tourism ==

In the department there are iconic landmarks that attract many visitors each year, such as the &quot;Château de Sedan&quot; (the busiest paying attraction in the Ardennes, with an average of 60,000 admissions per year), the fortified site of Charlemont at Givet, the fort at Les Ayvelles, and the fortress of Rocroi. There are also many fortified churches and medieval sites in the department. There is the Ardennes forest, the &quot;Green Way&quot; (a bicycle path connecting Montcy-Notre Dame near Charleville-Mézières to Givet along the Meuse valley) promoting weekend tourism and tourist routes (green tourism).

Cultural tourism is booming with many music festivals (Le Cabaret Vert, the Douzy&#x27;k festival, the Aymon Folk Festival) not to mention museums (such as the Museum of the Ardennes) and castles and the growing interest in industrial heritage.

Finally, the creation of the Natural Regional Park of Ardennes (Regional Natural Park of Ardennes) on 21 December 2011 should continue to increase this type of tourism.

=== Second homes ===
Home purchases by Belgians and Dutch people are common in the region because the prices are much lower than in their countries of residence. However, as of 2020, 3.5% of available housing in the department are second homes which is rather low.

== Culture ==
=== Festivals ===

For more than 40 years (the first time in 1961 at the initiative of Jacques Félix) there has been in Charleville-Mézières the &quot;World Festival of Puppet Theatre&quot; (now every three years). At the last festival in 2009 more than 200,000 people were present. In the same city there is also a school: the International Institute of Puppetry. The &quot;Rock Festival and Territory Le Cabaret Vert&quot; had more than 50,000 festival-goers at the seventh festival in 2011 and this takes place every year in Charleville-Mézières making it the 7th largest festival in France by attendance. The festival &quot;The Poetic Otherworld&quot; organizes events in October in some Ardennes communes.

At Sedan the medieval festival is held every year around the Castle of Sedan, the largest castle in Europe. This is an event that brings together more than 30,000 spectators.

At Rethel there are the famous festivals of Saint Anne which have been held for over 200 years.

At Bogny-sur-Meuse there is the &quot;Aymon Folk Festival&quot; which brings together nearly 10,000 people.

The Ardennes also has other well-known festivals such as the &quot;Festimeuse&quot; which attracts 10,000 people, the festival of &quot;Cassine&quot; with 7,000 people at the 3rd festival in 2010.

The metal festival of Vouziers attracts about 2000 people. The Rock festival in El Mont at Aiglemont hosted more than 2,000 people in 2010. Lastly there is at Douzy every July and every second year the Douzy&#x27;k Festival which brings between 5,000 and 7,000 people each time.

The Argonne does not have only two musical events. For 14 years, the village of Louvergny has staged a lyrical festival called &quot;Encounters of Louvergny&quot; in early August as the heart of the Argonne campaign, with singers from different countries. More recently &quot;Notes of Argonne&quot; propose to cross the Argonne mountains with concerts of classical music with regional and national performers. The May 2008 festival included Patrice Fontanarosa and his wife Marielle Nordmann. Both events had an immediate success in the region and the public has not stopped coming since.

=== Tales and legends ===
For a long time the region was a land of legends with its rocks, rivers, lakes, and thick dark forests: for example The Four Sons of Aymon, knights on their horse called Bayard helped by the enchanter Maugis who gave his name to village of Noyers-Pont-Maugis at the time of Charlemagne.

=== Literature ===
The play by William Shakespeare, &quot;As you Like It&quot; (1599), is set in the Forest of Arden, an imagined hybrid of the Ardennes and the Arden woods near his birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

The novel by Yves Gibeau, &quot;Les gros sous&quot; (The big money) (1953) takes place in the south-west of the department.

The Ardennes serves as the backdrop to the novel by Julien Gracq, &quot;A Balcony in the Forest&quot; (&quot;Un balcon en forêt&quot;), published in 1958 and for which Michel Mitrani made a film in 1979 with Jacques Villeret. This novel/story is based on the experience as a soldier by the author at the beginning of the Second World War.

The region serves as a backdrop for the Ardennes writer André Dhôtel (1900–1991), especially in &quot;Le Pays où l&#x27;on n’arrive jamais&quot; (The country where one never arrives).

=== Cinema ===
The department has a varied natural environment (the Meuse valley, the border between Belgium and France, the Ardennes plateau, forests, etc.) which attracts filmmakers and television which first began in the late 1960s and in the 1970s.

* &quot;Le Train&quot; (The Train) (1973) with Jean-Louis Trintignant and Romy Schneider was partly filmed in the valley of the Meuse
* &quot;Maigret chez les Flamands&quot; (Maigret and the Flemes)&quot; (1976), a novel by Georges Simenon who knew the area nearby (Liège). Since then he travelled a lot and located the action at Givet (the TV movie with Jean Richard was shot here).
* The film by Claude Autant-Lara, &quot;Les Patates&quot; (The Potatoes), produced in 1969 with Pierre Perret, was shot entirely in Bourg-Fidèle, a village on the plateau of Rocroi.
* In 2006, &quot;Les Enfants du Pays&quot; (The children of the country) by Pierre Javaux with Michel Serrault was located in a small village lost in the Ardennes Forest in May 1940 when five Senegalese Tirailleurs are isolated from their regiment and lost, meet an old man and his two small children left alone after the exodus of the population.
* In 2007, Marcel Trillat made &quot;Silence dans la vallée&quot; (Silence in the valley), a documentary about the liquidation of the ironworks at Nouzonville, the &quot;Ateliers Thomé-Génot&quot; (workshops Thomé-Génot) by American buyers who empty the cash for themselves. Cellatex suffered the same fate at Givet in 2000.

<text>In Roman mythology, Evander (from Greek &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;good man&quot; or &quot;strong man&quot;: an etymology used by poets to emphasize the hero&#x27;s virtue) was a culture hero from Arcadia, Greece, who was said to have brought the pantheon, laws, and alphabet of Greece to ancient Italy, where he founded the city of Pallantium on the future site of Palatine Hill, Rome, sixty years before the Trojan War. He instituted the festival of the Lupercalia. Evander was deified after his death and an altar was constructed to him on the Aventine Hill.

In addition, Strabo mentions a story that Rome was an Arcadian colony founded by Evander.

==Genealogy==
Dionysius of Halicarnassus writes that Evander was the son of Hermes and a local nymph of the Arcadians, called Themis. He also mentions that the writers of the early history of Rome called her, in their native language, Carmenta. Strabo writes that the Romans honour the mother of Evander, regarding her as one of the nymphs, and have renamed her Carmenta (a derivation of the Latin word for song).
Evander&#x27;s wisdom was beyond that of all Arcadians. His son Pallas apparently died childless; however, the &quot;gens&quot; Fabia claimed descent from Evander through his grandson Fabius, son of Hercules by a daughter of Evander.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus also mentions that some writers, including Polybius of Megalopolis say that Lavinia was the daughter of Evander and had a son with Heracles who was named Pallas.

==In the &quot;Aeneid&quot;==
Evander plays a major role in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; Books VIII-XII. Previous to the Trojan War, Evander gathered a group of native Latins to a city he founded in Italy near the Tiber river, which he named Pallantium. Virgil states that he named the city in honour of his Arcadian ancestor, Pallas, although Pausanias, Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus say that originally Evander&#x27;s birth city was Pallantium in Arcadia, after which he named the new city. The reasons for Evander&#x27;s fleeing his homeland are unclear; Ovid states that Evander had angered the gods and had been sent into exile by way of a trial; Dionysius describes a civil unrest in Arcadia which led to Evander and his people being forced to leave; the commentator Servius, however, recounts that Evander&#x27;s mother persuaded him to murder his father, Hermes, leading to the pair being banished from Arcadia, although other commentators have it that Evander killed his mother. Evander settled in Pallantium where it is said he killed the three-souled Erulus, the king of Italy, three times in one day, prior to becoming the most powerful King of Italy. 

The oldest tradition of its founding ascribes to Evander the erection of the Great Altar of Hercules in the Forum Boarium. In &quot;Aeneid&quot;, VIII, where Aeneas and his crew first come upon Evander and his people, they were venerating Hercules for dispatching the giant Cacus. Virgil&#x27;s listeners would have related this scene to the same Great Altar of Hercules in the Forum Boarium of their own day, one detail among many in the Aeneid that Virgil used to link the heroic past of myth with the Age of Augustus. Also according to Virgil, Hercules was returning from Gades with Geryon&#x27;s cattle when Evander entertained him. Evander then became the first to raise an altar to Hercules&#x27; heroism. This archaic altar was destroyed in the Great Fire of Rome, AD 64.

Because of their traditional ties, Evander aids Aeneas in his war against Turnus and the Rutuli: the Arcadian had known the father of Aeneas, Anchises, before the Trojan War, and shares a common ancestry through Atlas with Aeneas&#x27;s family. In the Aeneid, it is said that Evander took possession of the country Italy by force, murdering king Herilus, the king of Praeneste.

<doc id="83209" wikidata="Q3361" url="?curid=83209" title="Doubs">
<text>Doubs (, ; ; ) is a department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in Eastern France. Named after the river Doubs, it had a population of 543,974 in 2019. Its prefecture is Besançon and subprefectures are Montbéliard and Pontarlier.

Situated in the east of France and the east of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region, it shares a border with Switzerland of almost 170 km and most of its territory is included in the Jura Mountains. Its highest point is the Mont d&#x27;Or (1,463 m), and the three main rivers that flow through it are the Doubs, the Ognon and the Loue.

Economically, the Doubs département is one of the most industrialised in France, specialising in car manufacturing with the historic location of the Peugeot plant (Stellantis group) in Sochaux, metalworking and food processing. The Doubs is also home to many companies in the microtechnology sector, as well as being the historic cradle of the French watchmaking industry. Its agriculture, mainly focused on livestock and milk production, is symbolised by its cheeses (comté, mont d&#x27;or, morbier, cancoillotte) and charcuteries (Morteau sausage, Montbéliard sausage, smoked ham).

The department&#x27;s main tourist attractions are the citadel of Besançon and the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans, both UNESCO World Heritage sites, as well as the Château de Joux. The Doubs is renowned for its many remarkable natural sites, including the Lac de Saint-Point, the Saut du Doubs, the sources of the Doubs, Loue and Lison rivers, the Cirque de Consolation, the Grotte d&#x27;Osselle and the Gouffre de Poudrey. 

==History==

As early as the 13th century, inhabitants of the northern two-thirds of Doubs spoke Franc-Comtois, a dialect of the &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot;. Residents of the southern third of Doubs spoke a dialect of the Arpitan language. Both languages co-existed with French, the official language of law and commerce, and continued to be spoken frequently in rural areas into the 20th century. They are both still spoken today but not on a daily basis.

Doubs was important as a portal to Switzerland through the pass at Cluse de Pontarlier. Many famous people, including Mirabeau, Toussaint Louverture and Heinrich von Kleist, were imprisoned in the Château de Joux.

Doubs is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from part of the former province of Franche-Comté. The prefecture (capital) is Besançon.

In 1793, the republic of Mandeure was annexed by France and incorporated into the department. This district was passed between various territories and departments in the ensuing administrative reorganisations and wars, but was restored to Doubs in 1816 when the former principality of Montbéliard was also added to the department.

However, the commune of Le Cerneux-Péquignot was annexed by the Canton of Neuchâtel under the terms of the 1814 Treaty of Paris, and since remained Swiss territory.

Between the defeat of France at the Battle of Waterloo and November 1818, Doubs was included in the area occupied by Austrian troops.

Victor Hugo, Gustave Courbet, Armand Peugeot, Auguste and Louis Lumière and Frank Darabont are among the famous people born in Doubs.

<text>In Greek mythology, Busiris (Ancient Greek: Βούσιρις) was the name shared by two figures:

* Busiris, an Egyptian prince as one of the sons of King Aegyptus. He suffered the same fate as his other brothers, save Lynceus, when they were slain on their wedding night by their wives who obeyed the command of their father King Danaus of Libya. Busiris was the son of Aegyptus by Argyphia, a woman of royal blood and thus full brother of Lynceus, Proteus, Enceladus, Lycus and Daiphron. In some accounts, he could be a son of Aegyptus either by Eurryroe, daughter of the river-god Nilus, or Isaie, daughter of King Agenor of Tyre. Busiris married the Danaid Automate, daughter of Danaus and Europe. 
* Busiris, a king of Egypt, who used to sacrifice strangers and was killed by Heracles.

<text>Aube ( ) is a French department in the Grand Est region of northeastern France. As with sixty departments in France, this department is named after a river: the Aube. With 310,242 inhabitants (2019), Aube is the 74th department in terms of population. The inhabitants of the department are known as &quot;Aubois&quot; or &quot;Auboises&quot;.

The department was constituted by a decree of the National Assembly of 15 January 1790.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The Aube department is located in the southwest side of the Grand Est region. It borders the departments of Marne in the north (about 130 km long), Haute-Marne to the east (about 100 km long), Côte-d&#x27;Or in the southeast (about 45 km long), Yonne in the southwest (about 175 km long), and Seine-et-Marne in the west (about 45 km long).

=== Subregions of Aube ===
Within the department regions of natural or traditional countryside can be identified as follows:
* northwest quarter: &quot;Champagne crayeuse&quot; (chalky Champagne soil)
* northwestern tip: the &quot;Nogentais&quot;
* southwest of Troyes: the Othe region
* to the south: &quot;le Chaourçois&quot;
* to the northeast: the &quot;Briennois&quot;
* to the east: the &quot;Barrois&quot;
* between Troyes and Barrois: Champagne wetlands

=== Communes of Aube ===
Aube is divided into 431 communes totalling 310,242 inhabitants (2019). The most populous commune is the prefecture Troyes. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

All of those communes, except Romilly-sur-Seine, are part of the agglomeration of Troyes.

=== Topography and geology ===
=== Hydrography ===
There are 23 rivers throughout the department, the four main rivers being the Seine, the Aube (tributary of the Seine), the Armance (tributary of the Armançon), and the Vanne (a tributary of the Yonne).

=== Forests and lakes ===
The department has 140,000 hectares of forests.

Located in the Community of communes of Forests, lakes, and lands in Champagne, the Orient Forest Regional Natural Park was one of the first natural parks created in France.

In the same place, there is the Orient Lake and the Amance and Temple lakes where fishing, recreational water sports, and bathing are available. Each lake specialises in one or more of these activities.

=== Climate ===
The climate is moderate without intense cold or excessive heat which represents a climate similar to continental and oceanic.

Between 1950 and 1985 the average annual temperature recorded in the department was 10.1 °C which is equivalent to the Paris basin and the cities of north-eastern France. The average sunshine hours per year is 1771.

Average annual rainfall is quite high (653.4 mm over 115 days of rain). In general there is more rain in autumn than in winter but rainfall is highest during spring. In contrast summer is the season when rainfall is lowest. There is, however, more rain in the south-east than the north-west.

Snow is relatively infrequent. Prevailing wind is from the west.

=== Channels of communication and transport ===

==== Road network ====
The department has 150 km of autoroutes, 33 km of national roads, 4,517 km of departmental roads and 2,116 km of local roads.

==== Communal transport ====
In the Agglomeration of Troyes &quot;TCAT&quot; (Transport for the Communes of Troyes) provides a transport network between communes. Unlike many networks that are provided by other operators, the agglomeration community of the city is the owner of the company. The network currently serves eleven communes including two outside the Troyes agglomeration. Other cities, including Romilly-sur-Seine, have no transport network.

Aube also has intercity transport networks. 21 regular bus routes are operated between the major cities of the department. The use of these lines is entrusted to private coaches: &quot;Transdev – The Carriers of Aube&quot; has 15 routes, &quot;Keolis Sud Lorraine&quot; has 4 routes, &quot;Procars Champagne&quot; has 2 routes, &quot;Autocars Bardy&quot; has one route.

==== Rail network ====
Five railway stations are currently in operation. These are: Nogent-sur-Seine, Romilly-sur-Seine, Troyes, Vendeuvre-sur-Barse, Bar-sur-Aube.

Aube does not have a strong rail coverage. Only one main non-electrified line passes through Aube – the line that connects Paris-Est to Mulhouse.

==== Navigable waterways ====
The department has 34.8 km of navigable waterways. The city of Nogent-sur-Seine has two river ports for grain.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The first inhabitants of Aube were the Tricasses and Lingones with a substantial human settlement around the year 400 BC.

Saints Potentian and Savinian, Greek priests from Samos, came to preach the gospel from the middle of the 3rd century. Saint Patroclus was one of the first martyrs of the new faith in the year 259. Shortly after &quot;Saint Jule&quot; and some notables of the city of Tricasses also suffered martyrdom. Nevertheless, as elsewhere, the Christian community became large enough to accommodate a bishop. &quot;Saint Amateur&quot; was the first in 340. In the year 286 the Bagaudae ravaged the land which forms Aube. Emperor Julian came to Troyes with his army and rescued it.

The territory making up Aube was first attached to France in 843, following the Treaty of Verdun.

=== The 12th century and the monasteries ===
Two important monasteries were founded in the department: one at Clairvaux in 1114, created by Bernard of Clairvaux, the other was the Abbey of the Paraclete near Nogent-sur-Seine, by his illustrious rival, Pierre Abélard and of which Héloïse d&#x27;Argenteuil was the first abbess. Bernard of Clairvaux was noted for his eloquence at the Council of Troyes and his preaching of the Second Crusade which had no result and whose outcome was disastrous.

The reunion of Champagne with the kingdom of France was finalised in 1361. Yet people wanted absolutely the incorporation of Champagne but in 1328 King Philip VI gave the city of Bar-sur-Seine to Philippe de Croy. The inhabitants, however, ransomed him to return it to the king on the condition that it become inalienable.

=== Definitive reunion with Kingdom of France ===
The decree of the National Assembly of 15 January 1790 formally established the department of Aube. Its first president was Augustin-Henri-Marie Picot and his first deputy was Louis Antoine Joseph Robin. Jacques Claude Beugnot was elected attorney-general and also MP.

After the victory of the allies in the battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, the department was occupied by Russian troops from June 1815 to November 1818.

In 1911, following the revolt of the vineyards of Champagne, large riots broke out in the department.

In 1919, a decree allowed Aube department to produce champagne for the first time.

In 1932, Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk visited Aube and signed a friendship treaty with France there on 4 July 1938.

=== Heraldry ===
== Politics and administration ==

=== Departmental council ===
The departmental council of Aube is located in Troyes. Its president is Philippe Pichery (Miscellaneous right). It includes the 34 councillors of the 17 cantons of Aube. Of these, 32 are from the Right (mainly the UMP), the others are from the Miscellaneous left.

Aube returns three Deputies to the National Assembly, two of whom are from The Republicans (LR), and two Senators: one UMP and one right-wing independent.

=== Breakdown of population by socio-professional categories ===
== Economy ==

=== General ===
The economy of Aube has focused on the textile industry since the 19th century. This sector is now in crisis due to the department being in an area of real economic change.

In 2017, the departmental workforce totalled 137,774 with 114,530 persons in employment and 23,244 people unemployed. Men accounted for 51.4% of the active population and women 48.6%.

The Aube department has a high rate of feminization in employment. Nearly half of people with active jobs (48.1% in 2017) are women. The main areas affected by the feminization are trade, transport, textiles, utilities, education, and health. Women are slightly more affected than men by unemployment (51.3% of the unemployed in 2017). This is mainly due to layoffs in the textile sector.

<text>Aude ( ; ) is a department in Southern France, located in the Occitanie region and named after the river Aude. The departmental council also calls it &quot;Cathar Country&quot; (French: &quot;Pays cathare&quot;) after a group of religious dissidents active in the 12th to 14th centuries.

Its prefecture is Carcassonne and its subprefectures are Limoux and Narbonne. As of 2019, it had a population of 374,070. Aude is a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Eudo, brother of Saint Hubertus. Aude was the name of Roland&#x27;s fiancée in the &quot;chansons de geste&quot;.

==Geography==

===Location===
Aude is located between the Mediterranean Sea and the Pyrenees Mountains.

It is part of the current region of Occitanie. It is surrounded by the departments of Pyrénées-Orientales, Ariège, Haute-Garonne, Tarn, and Hérault, with the Golfe du Lion on the east.

===Natural regions===

The countryside in this department falls into several natural regions:
* 1 – Lauragais
* 2 – Montagne Noire
* 3 – Cabardès
* 4 – Carcassonais
* 5 – Razès
* 6 – Quercorb
* 7 – Pays de Sault
* 8 – Minervois
* 9 – Corbières
* 10 – Narbonnais

===Landscapes===

Each natural region of the Aude has its own particular landscape. In the east, lagoons or coastal lakes separate land and sea. These were formed by accumulations of sediments carried down by the rivers Aude, Orb and Hérault. There are many such lakes of brackish water. This environment is demanding for flora and fauna, as it suffers from the rigours of sea, sun, dryness and floods. Halophile (i.e., salt-loving) plants grow there. The area is also noted for the pink flamingo and the white stilt.

Inland to the west, shrub and scrub dominate the landscape of the drylands of the Aude and the Corbières Massif. This landscape is the result of forest clearance, maintained by the raising of livestock. The flora is varied and characterized by many species of orchids. The Sault countryside is dominated by beech groves and fir plantations up to the mountains. These forests are known for their mushrooms, and have a rich flora and fauna, including the Pyrenean lily, the euproctis moth and horsetail of the woods.

To the north and west, the Black Mountain country is made up of forests of oak and beech. The Lauragais is a wooded landscape where grain farming has shaped the hills. There are bodies of water like the Lac de la Ganguise. Finally, the high valley of the Aude, otherwise called the Razès, consists of a riparian forest made of beech, alder, poplar or ash. It includes some peatlands that are very rare in southern France.

===Geology===

The landscapes of Aude can be explained by its geology. In the south, there are sedimentary rocks folded during the formation of the Pyrenees. To the north and centre of Aude, the sedimentary rocks are less folded. At the extreme east, near the Mediterranean, the rocks are carved by normal collapse faults which are due to the opening of the Golfe du Lion.

In the north, the Black Mountain and Minervois consist of schist and marble, forming the southern edge of the Massif Central. These ancient rocks are over 300 million years old and were deformed by the formation of the Hercynian chain. The Montagne d&#x27;Alaric (Alaric&#x27;s Mountain) is an antiform fold in the shape of a vault and made of limestone.

===Climate===

Aude is under the influence of a Mediterranean climate.

The autumn is characterized by violent and short storms.
The summer is often hot and dry, which is favorable to the culture of the vine and the olive-trees. Yet, the department has several contrasts in climate:
In the north, the Montagne Noire and, in the south, the Pays de Sault, have a mountainous climate with temperatures sometimes very low in winter.
In the west, the climate is under Aquitaine influence with heavier precipitation, while in the east the climate is purely Mediterranean.
In the centre, in the Limouxin, Carcassonnais and Razès areas, the climate is known as intermediary with significant exposure to winds.
The winds are often present in Aude. It is one of the windiest French departments, with 300 to 350 days of wind per year. This phenomenon is due mostly to the variations in relief north and south which create a kind of corridor.

In the north-west blows the Cers, called Tramontane in Provence, which is a ground wind. It is a dry, somewhat violent wind and cold in winter. In the south-east blows the Autan, locally called the Marin, which is hot and wet and comes from the sea.

These regular winds made it possible to install an industrial park of wind turbines, as in the area of Avignonet-Lauragais.

===Hydrography===
The drainage system of Aude is dominated by its river of the same name. The river rises at the Roc d&#x27;Aude and passes through the Matemale and Puyvalador dams on the Capcir plateau at 1500m, then crosses the department from south to north across Axat, Limoux, and Quillan following the upper valley of the Aude. At Carcassonne, the river changes direction toward the Mediterranean Sea to the east, where it empties near Fleury.

==Principal towns==

The most populous commune is Narbonne; the prefecture Carcassonne is the second-most populous. As of 2019, there are 5 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

==History==

===Prehistory===

Hammers and worked tools have been found on the hill of Grazailles at Carcassonne, dating from between 690,000 and 300,000 years ago. Most interesting is the skull of Tautavel Man, discovered in 1971 by Henry de Lumley in the commune of Tautavel in the Pyrénées-Orientales department. It is the oldest-known skull in Europe. It dates from about 450,000 years BC. It is likely that Tautavel Man lived in all of this region.

===Roman Era===
The Romans, led by the consul-general Domitius Ahenobarbus, first occupied the oppidum of Montlaurès in 118 BC, a few kilometres to the north of Narbonne. This became the provincial capital and a very active mercantile port. The position was strategically important since it stood at the crossroads of two Roman roads, the Via Aquitania and the Via Domitia, as well as by the sea near the mouth of the river Aude. Carcassonne became Latin in 30 BC with the creation of numerous grain farms. For almost two centuries, Aude enjoyed peace and strong economic growth.

===Barbarian invasions===
The Visigoths invaded the area in 435 AD at a time when Flavius Aetius, the Roman senator, was busy suppressing the Bagaudes, who were brigands or lawless types in central and northern Gaul. Roman authority was restored until 462. In 507, the victory of Clovis I at the battle of Vouillé permitted him to conquer Toulouse and Aquitaine. However, he could not recover the Aude territory, which, thanks to the help of the King of the Ostrogoths, remained in the hands of the Visigoths. His troops defeated Clovis&#x27;s son in 508. The region was part of Septimania, so called because it was composed of seven bishoprics that the Visigoth kings had established there: Elne, Agde, Narbonne, Lodève, Béziers, Maguelonne, and Nîmes. Septimania covered the Aude but also the whole region of Languedoc-Roussillon.

===Middle Ages===
In 817, Louis le Débonnaire detached Carcassès and Razès from Septimania to reunite them with the marquisate of Toulouse and the kingdom of Aquitaine. The first Count of Carcassonne was Oliba from the family of the Counts of Barcelona. He established himself in 819. Razès was another county that was formed by an archbishop of Narbonne who had been chased from his town by the Saracens. He had transferred his episcopal seat to Razès and had procured the honours of the feudal title for the area. Narbonne formed a third county. Thus, in the ninth century, the département of Aude consisted of three counties: Carcassonne, Razès and Narbonne. In 880, the County of Razès was united by marriage to that of Carcassonne, never to be separated.

===Catharism in Aude===
In the 13th century, the region saw the development of Catharism: a dualistic Christian sect with similarities to Gnosticism. This religion was very quickly judged as heretical by the Catholic Church. Faced with its growing strength in the counties of Carcassonne and Toulouse, Pope Innocent III in 1209 declared a crusade against the Albigensians. The barons of the north united to form an army under the command of Simon de Montfort. Whereas the count of Toulouse Raymond VI received absolution, the Count of Carcassonne confronted the army alone. The city of Carcassonne became the refuge of numerous Cathars.

===The Protestant crisis and economic expansion of the department===
In 1561, religious troubles again arose at Carcassonne in the form of a Protestant crisis. Duke Henri I de Montmorency, the Governor of the Languedoc, joined the Reformed side in 1574. On the Catholic side, the Duke Anne de Joyeuse became head of the Catholic League. In September 1632, Henri II de Montmorency fought against the royal troops at the Battle of Castelnaudary and was defeated. He was condemned to death and executed at Toulouse.

===The creation of the department===
The present department is one of the original 83 departments created by the Constituent Assembly during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. It was created from part of the former province of Languedoc.
Administrative divisions were amended by the Act of 28 Pluviôse of Year 8, which created four arrondissements (reduced to three by Premier Raymond Poincaré in 1926) and reduced the number of cantons from 45 to 31.

===The 20th century===
The Aude enjoyed strong wine production whilst at the same time the grain farmers of Lauragais faced great difficulties. However, the department suffered from overproduction and a slump in sales of wine. In 1907 the crisis produced a winemakers&#x27; revolt. This led to the establishment of many Winemaking cooperatives in Aude from 1909.

===Heraldry===
==Economy==

===Overview===

===Agriculture and fisheries===

Aude is an agricultural area dominated by vineyards. In the east are the wines of Corbieres and La Clape, in the centre are Minervois and Côtes de Malepère, and in the south Limoux wine. In Lauragais grain is predominant, whereas in the Montagne Noire only sheep farming is possible. More recently there has been an increase in cultivation of olive trees for their oil.

Port-la-Nouvelle is the biggest fishing port in the department followed by Gruissan. In 1996 there were 127 vessels in Aude including 75 in Port-la-Nouvelle and 52 in Gruissan. These vessels were as follows:
* Fishing trawlers: 19 in Port-la-Nouvelle
* tuna boats: 2 in Port-la-Nouvelle
* small craft: 106 including 54 in Port-La-Nouvelle and 52 in Gruissan

Small craft are recreational boats such as dinghies with one man fishing a lake or motor launches with up to three people fishing in coastal waters. About 85% of small craft are intended for lake fishing as in the Étang de Thau.

===Viticulture===

Viticulture is the main economic activity of the department due to its rich and varied soils. It was the Greeks who established vineyards in Aude and the Romans who determined the rights of exploitation. The first vines were planted in Minervois in the 1st century.

But the grapes and wines were not consumer products or self-sufficient for many years. Cereals and olive trees dominated the fertile plains of Aude. It was at the beginning of the 19th century that the wine industry developed in Aude and the rest of Languedoc-Roussillon. Wine then became a consumer product. Higher output was needed and vineyards replaced cereals on the plains. There was an initial period of prosperity to 1850 before phylloxera appeared towards 1870. At the end of the 19th century, Aude experienced a second period of prosperity but there was a wine crisis triggered in 1901 because of over-production, fraud, and slumping sales. It reached its peak during the winemakers revolt in 1907. The wine growers regrouped themselves into winemaking cooperatives to prevent fraud and deception. In 1919 then in 1935, a law of AOC was adopted under the leadership of Jean Capus. The INAO was set up as a body to control the application of the new laws.

After the Second World War, the vineyards were revitalized and the region saw a mass of viticulture. The wine was produced in large quantities and satisfied a very demanding population. The product was supplied in large quantities at very low prices. In 1970 the market evolved replacing demand for quantity with demand for quality and causing a second wine crisis. Many events, negotiations, and attacks paralyzed the region and the economy. Emile Pouytès and the CRS Joel le Gof died at Montredon-des-Corbières on 4 March 1976 during this crisis. A large change in the Aude viticulture business started with a reorganization of the profession and the wine-growing region. Quality had to become the mark of wine from Aude.

The rich and varied soil of Aude together with abundant sunshine abounds enables Aude to produce quality wines. Many wines emanate from the department, ranging in quality from table wines to AOCs, passing through vins de pays and VDQS.

There are seven main areas of production:
* Cabardès AOC (1),
* Corbières AOC (6),
* Côtes Malepère AOC near Carcassonne (2),
* Coteaux du Languedoc on the plain of Narbonnais (5),
* Fitou AOC (7),
* Limoux wine (3),
* Minervois AOC (4).

These areas produce different wines such as &quot;Blanquette de Limoux&quot;, Chardonnay and sparkling wine from Limoux, &quot;La Clape&quot;, Corbières, Fitou, and Cabardès.

===Industry and energy===
Industrial activity is strong in the upper valley of the Aude. It has been especially prominent around Limoux since the late nineteenth century; and the Lafarge brick plant there is still booming.

Since the 1970s, however, the Aude has seen a rapid decline in its traditional industries such as shoe and hat making. More recent activity is mostly centred around Narbonne, particularly dock facilities and oil depots in Port-la-Nouvelle.

From 1889, the high valley of Aude became increasingly important in generating hydroelectric power. Aude was the first department in France to transmit such power, from its plants at Alet-les-Bains and Quillan. Joachim Estrade established the first electricity company in France, the Southern Power Transmission Company (SMTF), in 1901. Its plant at Axat-Saint-Georges supplied the cities of Carcassonne and Narbonne at 20 kilovolts.

Today Aude is the leading department in France for the number of wind turbines installed. There are 113 in operation. They produce some 91 megawatts, which is the domestic electricity consumption of about 100,000 people. With the proliferation of these machines, the prefecture is seeking to establish with stakeholders a charter of good conduct for wind turbines.

===Crafts===
Crafts are very well represented in Aude with 14.6% of the population involved. Some 5,400 businesses operating in 250 craft professions achieved in the late 1990s an annual turnover of 3 billion francs (400 million Euros).

==Demography==
The inhabitants of Aude are known as &quot;Audois&quot;. The 1990 census confirmed a growth in population since the 1960s with about 700 people more per year. This growth is explained by the return of pensioners aged over 60 years to their place of origin and to immigration from the Mediterranean basin.

At the last census, the population of Aude represented 0.5% of the French population and 14.1% of the population of Languedoc-Roussillon. It is predominantly rural with a density of 48 inhabitants per km2, which is slightly less than half the national average. The two main cities, Carcassonne and Narbonne, are medium-sized cities comprising only one third of the inhabitants of the department. In 2017, the department had 370,260 inhabitants.

==Transport==
Two major roads cross the Aude. From west to east the A61 autoroute (Autoroute des Deux Mers) connects Narbonne and Toulouse via Carcassonne. From north to south, following the Mediterranean coast, the A9 autoroute links Montpellier with Spain.

The rail network follows the same route as the road network. It is a low speed system, but a project is under way to build a fast line to Spain as part of the Trans-European Rail network.

Finally, Aude is crossed by the Canal du Midi which is a major waterway that allows tourists to pass from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. It comes into the west of Aude at Seuil de Naurouze then joins the Mediterranean at Sète.

==Politics==

The people of Aude expressed royalist opinions until the end of the Bourbon Restoration. In 1830 republican ideas began to develop and made this department a bastion of the left. This growth is symbolized by two men, Armand Barbès and Theophile Marcou. Armand Barbès is a symbol of the struggle for a social democratic Republic.

It was in Aude that François Mitterrand had his highest score in the 1981 presidential election with just over 63% of the vote.

Only affluent coastal areas surrounding Narbonne and the department&#x27;s prefecture, Carcassonne give consideration to the right.

The President of the Departmental Council is Hélène Sandragné of the Socialist Party.

===National Assembly Representatives (before 2022)===

==Education==
Aude department in 2008 had 364 primary schools (schools of the first degree) serving 30,771 students.
 Between 2000 and 2007, primary school enrollment steadily increased from 28,331 students to 30,491 students At secondary level, the department had 31 colleges and 17 public and private high schools for about 23,000 students in 2006.

Education in Aude now includes teaching in the Occitan language.

==Culture==

===Festivals and traditions===
The Carnival of Limoux is an Aude festival which takes place over a period of ten weeks or more. This is one of the longest carnivals in the world. It takes place in the town of Limoux on the Place de la République every weekend from mid-January to the end of March. It is characterized by bands in Pierrot costumes (known as &quot;les fécos&quot;) accompanied by musicians. In the region around Limoux a major celebration of gastronomy known as &quot;Toques et Clochers&quot; (literally, &quot;Tall Hats &amp; Steeples&#x27;) organized by the winegrowers from Sieur d&#x27;Arques&#x27; takes place over the weekend of Palm Sunday. It permits the sale of a large quantity of wine in order to enhance local patronage.

===Sport===
Aude is the land of rugby league (rugby à XIII) with the teams of Limoux, Carcassonne and Lézignan among the elite. Puig Aubert (1925–1994) was a famous rugby league player who played with AS Carcassonne. There are numerous amateur rugby league clubs dotted all over the area.

Rugby union (rugby à XV) is also played in Aude. It appeared early in the twentieth century and the US-Quillan club dominated in the late 1920s. Jean Bourrel won the title in 1929 against Lézignan. After the Second World War, the Carcassonne team took the lead. Recently, however, rugby union in the Aude has faced an uphill struggle in a sport that has become both globalized and more professional. The Narbonne team (known as Racing Club Narbonne-Mediterranean) has nevertheless managed to develop in the Pro D2 championship.

Every 15 August, in Quillan, an international cycling competition takes place. This is the oldest of such contests in France.

The Tour de l&#x27;Aude is one of the most important female cycling events in the calendar. It generally takes place in May.

===Gastronomy===

, a traditional type of fricasee of pork from Corbières, can be found throughout the department. It is made from pork and pig&#x27;s liver with a local variety of white beans (Lingots de Castelnaudary) flavoured with garigue herbs. On the coast, eel stew (borrida d’anguilles) is a dish of choice. Finally, the cassoulet of Castelnaudary, made from white beans and sausage, is a typical dish of the Lauragais.

Other specialties exist such as oysters from Gruissan and Leucate. Olive oil is also very widespread in the Aude and is a speciality of Bize-Minervois. &quot;Cartagena&quot; is a liqueur marketed by some manufacturers. Finally, the Blanquette de Limoux is a sparkling white wine popular in the department whose origin dates back to the sixteenth century.

===Occitan===
Occitan is spoken in the Aude in its Languedoc variant. The language emerged during the High Middle Ages from the Latin used in the south of Gaul.

In Aude, Occitan was rarely used in writing before the 11th century. However, several poets and troubadours such as Raimon de Miraval used language based on courtly love in the 12th and 13th centuries. In the 14th and 15th centuries, Occitan was used to draw up local administrative documents. In the 16th century, Occitan was used less than royal French, whose use was made compulsory by the edict of Villers-Cotterêts in 1539. However, it survived very well among the people until the 19th century, when public schools were established with teaching solely in French.

In the 1970s and the 1980s, new demands were made for the dignity of the language and for its teaching. Occitan speech reached a wider audience and singers like Claudi Marti, &quot;Mans de Brèish&quot;, and &quot;La Sauze&quot; promoted its use.

It was in Aude that the first Occitan radio station broadcast in the region of Languedoc-Roussillon: Ràdio Lenga (Occitan) at 95.5 FM.

==Tourism==
Aude is a tourist department with a rich cultural heritage and varied natural sites. Since the 1990s, the Aude has developed the attractiveness of its territory by focusing on the development of the publicity surrounding Catharism. The Aude has been named &quot;Cathar Country&quot; by the General Council to mark the authentic and mysterious nature of the department, especially with its many Cathar castles.

Tourism is also promoted through a stock of hotel rooms in all categories of 313,500 beds available year-round. Aude estimates the number of tourist overnight stays to be 17.11 million in 2010 with a turnover of 842 million euros providing 5,800 full-time jobs and 9,500 seasonal jobs.

In a very limited section of the Orbiel Valley the department has had occasional pollution problems because of its abandoned gold mines (with mercury and arsenic).

===Overview of tourist areas===
Carcassonne has been restored to much of its medieval appearance. Narbonne is a tourist destination due to its Roman ruins.
Other towns and villages worth visiting include Limoux, Quillan, Lézignan-Corbières, Lagrasse, Sigean and Leucate.

Limoux lies in the upper Aude valley, 24 km south of Carcassonne. It is known for its local wine, Blanquette, a sparkling white wine which is said to have been the forerunner of Champagne. Limoux hosts an extensive and varied market each Friday.

Quillan lies 27 km further south in the upper Aude valley and is at the head of the branch railway from Carcassonne.

Lézignan-Corbières lies on the main road between Carcassonne and Narbonne. It is called the capital of the Corbières and has a Wednesday morning market.

Lagrasse stands on the River Orbieu and has an 8th-century abbey, two very attractive bridges and an unchanged and very compact and delightful medieval stone village centre.

Sigean, 18 km south of Narbonne, lies between the A9 autoroute and the coast and has an African Reserve.

Leucate is a hilltop village, about 30 km south of Narbonne, which has spread down to the coast where Leucate Plage is a popular beach resort.

The Corbières Massif forms the central part of the department. This is an area of dissected plateaux and escarpments which form an effective barrier to direct road communication. It is a very attractive and sometimes wild area of steep hills, hidden valleys, woodland and vines, and contains some of the most memorable Cathar sites including Quéribus, Peyrepertuse and Villerouge-Termenès.

The Lauragais, that spreads on both sides of the administrative border between Aude and Haute-Garonne, is a historic and cultural area known since the Middle Ages for its abundant agricultural productions. With Castelnaudary as a central and major city, this region is also famous for the role it played during the Albigensian Crusade and for its local heritage: Canal du Midi and its springs, abbeys and churches, castles, disk-shaped steles, dovecotes, windmills, bastides, etc.

Wine production is extensive across Aude, and local chateaux and domaines provide free tastings as well as sales of wine and other local produce. With the decline of some local wine production, local government policy is now to attract more tourists to the area, and to assist with this the Corbières area is now labelled on maps and road signs as Cathar country.

===Architectural heritage===
The Aude has about fifteen bastides which were built after the Treaty of Meaux in 1229 when the region was attached to the Capetian crown of France. The bastide is a type of town based on a grid created in one building project on a greenfield site. The purpose of such construction was to weaken the local lords and attract people to new economic centres. These bastides came into competition with fortified villages based on ecclesiastical or seigneurial power. Chalabre, Camps-sur-l&#x27;Agly and the Bastide Saint-Louis in Carcassonne are examples of bastides in the Aude.
The department has many castles that have been developed by the General Council of the Aude to stimulate tourism. The fortresses are often located on rocky peaks, such as the castles of Quéribus and Lastours, which gave them a strategic position. The city of Carcassonne was the logistical hub of the country at the time of conflict with the Kingdom of Aragon.

Many abbeys exist throughout the department of Aude. The best known are Fontfroide Abbey, Lagrasse Abbey, the abbey of Sainte-Marie Villelongue-d&#x27;Aude, and the Abbey of Saint-Hilaire.

Narbonne Cathedral is a remarkable Gothic cathedral and remains unfinished. It is a symbol of the French presence in Languedoc in the Middle Ages.

===Caving===
Aude has many caves suitable for speleological exploration. The &quot;Pays de Sault&quot; consists of one of the largest limestone areas of the Pyrenees. This geology lends itself to the formation of cavities and there are many &#x27;barrencs&#x27; (the local name for Pit caves). This plateau is home to a cave, the TM71, which is a superb cavity classified as a natural reserve since 1987. This is unique in France.

Other natural cavities of the Aude contain concretions like the Pit cave of Cabrespine, the Aguzou Grotto, and the grotto of Limousis. The latter contains the largest block of aragonite yet discovered. In the Massif of Corbières on the plateau of Lacamp there are cavities formed by detrital rocks (marls, clays and puddingstone) carved by erosion.

===Secondary housing===
According to INSEE 25.4% of available housing in Aude consisted of secondary residences. The following table indicates the main communes in Aude (population more than 2,000) where second homes or occasional residences comprise more than 10% of total housing.

===Cinema===
The diversity of the landscape, its authenticity, and the uniqueness of its monuments have attracted many filmmakers. Thus, the city of Carcassonne has been the setting for many films. The excellent state of preservation of this city offers an outstanding setting for historical films. In 1908 filmmakers abandoned scenery on canvas and Louis Feuillade filmed in front of the city towers for the &quot;Return of the cross&quot;, &quot;Engagement oath&quot;, and &quot;Enchanted guitar&quot;. In 1924 major films were produced such as &quot;Le Miracle des Loups&quot; by Raymond Bernard. In 1928 for the two thousandth anniversary of the city of Carcassonne, Jean Renoir made &quot;Le Tournoi dans la cité&quot;. In 1965 the city of Carcassonne appeared in &quot;The Sucker&quot; by Gerard Oury. In 1968 &quot;The Little Bather&quot; by Robert Dhéry (with Louis de Funès and Michel Galabru) shot at &quot;Cabanes de Fleury&quot; (at the mouth of the Aude).

More recently, the Count&#x27;s castle in the city was the setting for &quot;The Visitors&quot; by Jean-Marie Poire in 1972, while the Château de Puivert was used in &quot;La Passion Béatrice&quot; by Bertrand Tavernier in 1987, and &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; by Roman Polanski in 1999. The Beach at Gruissan is present in Betty Blue by Jean-Jacques Beineix.

===Painters===
As for the cinema, it is the city of Carcassonne which attracts the greatest painters. Jacques Ourtal is the one who painted most of the city in trying to depict the city in different eras. Originally from Fontiers-Cabardès, the Aude painter &quot;Eugène Pech&quot; has created paintings of the city many times which are today scattered in various public and private collections. The four eras of the city can still be found in settings for &quot;The City Hall&quot;.

Another Aude artist, Marie-Louise Petiet, is known for her transcriptions of scenes of popular life such as &quot;La marchande d&#x27;oranges&quot; (The Orange Seller) or &quot;La jeune fille aux oies&quot; (The young girl and the geese). Several of her works are visible at the Petiet Museum in Limoux. &quot;Les blanchisseuses&quot; (The Laundresses) depicting a laundry lesson is particularly remarkable and well-known. Finally, Paul Sibra, an expert in landscape-painting, nicknamed &quot;le peintre du Lauragais&quot;, produced thousands of paintings and drawings of scenes from or based on the rural life of the people of &quot;Lauragais&quot; in the 1940s.

Achilles Laugé (born 1861 in Arzens, died 1944 in Cailhau), misunderstood because of his pointillist technique, was able to show the dawning of spring especially with the broom and almond trees in bloom.

Another artist, Lina Bill (Louis Bonnot), born at Gruissan in 1855 and died in Avignon in 1936, painted Provence and the Mediterranean (museums of Narbonne, Carcassonne, and the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris).

<text>Aveyron (; ) is a department in the region of Occitania, Southern France. It was named after the river Aveyron. Its inhabitants are known as &quot;Aveyronnais&quot; (masculine) or &quot;Aveyronnaises&quot; (feminine) in French. The inhabitants of Aveyron&#x27;s prefecture, Rodez, are called &quot;Ruthénois&quot;, based upon the first settlers in the area, the Ruteni. With an area of and a population of 279,595, Aveyron is a largely rural department with a population density of .

==History==

Aveyron is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790. The earliest known inhabitants of the region were the Rutenii tribe, though the area was inhabited prior to their tenure. The department has many prehistoric monuments, including over a thousand dolmens, the most of any department in France.
During the medieval and early modern periods, and until the 1790s, the territory included within Aveyron was a province known as Rouergue. In 1797, Victor of Aveyron (a feral child) was found wandering the woods in the area. The story of Victor is told in the film &quot;The Wild Child&quot;.

In 1817, a local prosecutor, Antoine Bernardin Fualdès, was assassinated. The sordid circumstances of his death, following which his body was found floating in the river Aveyron, led to the matter becoming publicised as a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;. Recent studies have indicated that he met his end at the initiative of a right-wing royalist organisation known as the &quot;Chevaliers de la Foi&quot; (Knights of Faith).

===Heraldry===
== Geography ==
Aveyron is the centre of a triangle formed by the cities of Toulouse, Clermont-Ferrand, and Montpellier. The department approximately follows the outline of the former province of Rouergue. It is the 5th largest department in metropolitan France in terms of area (). Its prefecture is Rodez.

The department comes under the jurisdiction of the Academy of Toulouse and the Montpellier Court of Appeal. The INSEE and Post Code is 12. Aveyron is located in the south of the Massif Central. The highest point in the department is the summit of the &quot;Signal de Mailhebiau&quot; at 1469m on the Plateau of Aubrac. The Aveyron department is divided into several natural regions such as the Grand Causses and Rougiers.

Aveyron department consists of an ancient high rocky plateau of great geological diversity. The Truyère, Lot, Aveyron, and Tarn rivers have carved a number of deep gorges. The department is surrounded by those of Tarn, Tarn-et-Garonne, Lot, Hérault, Gard, Lozère and Cantal. The Lac de Villefranche-de-Panat is used as a reservoir to provide drinking water supplies for the region.

==Culture==

===Regional sub-dialect===
The regional sub-dialect spoken in Aveyron is a form of Languedoc Occitan called &quot;Rouergat&quot;. Faced with the risk of disappearance of the language several associations asked the State and political communities for an ambitious language policy. 
In Rouergat, &quot;Aveyron&quot; is written:
*&quot;Avairon&quot; (traditional Occitan spelling) – e.g. &quot;Roergue forma lo despartament de l&#x27;Avairon&quot;
*Oboyróu (spelling of Father Vayssier) – e.g. &quot;Rouergue fouórmo lou desportomén de l&#x27;Oboyróu&quot;

== Tourism ==
Aveyron contains part of the Cévennes National Park. Tourist attractions include the castle of Najac, a medieval ruin perched high on a hill, and other castles and monasteries such as Conques Abbey, Sylvanès Abbey, Bonneval Abbey and Loc-Dieu Abbey, located near Martiel in a region with many dolmens. The small city of Millau is the site of the world&#x27;s tallest bridge, the Millau viaduct, opened by President Chirac in December 2004.

Activities include horseriding, fishing, swimming in the &quot;Lacs du Lévézou&quot; and hiking/camping. The inhabitants are also very good craftsmen, and Aveyron is full of various craft objects, handmade, that can be found locally. Examples include the &quot;couteau de Laguiole&quot;, the world famous &quot;Roquefort&quot; cheese, from the village of the same name and other local produce. Markets take place every Saturday on market places around the region.

Saint-Sernin-sur-Rance is the commune where the feral child Victor of Aveyron was found in the late 18th century.

<text>Mars 1, also known as 1962 Beta Nu 1, Mars 2MV-4 and Sputnik 23, was an automatic interplanetary station launched in the direction of Mars on November 1, 1962, the first of the Soviet Mars probe program, with the intent of flying by the planet at a distance of about . It was designed to image the surface and send back data on cosmic radiation, micrometeoroid impacts and Mars&#x27; magnetic field, radiation environment, atmospheric structure, and possible organic compounds.

After leaving Earth orbit, the spacecraft and the Molniya booster&#x27;s fourth stage separated and the solar panels were deployed. Early telemetry indicated that there was a leak in one of the gas valves in the orientation system so the spacecraft was transferred to gyroscopic stabilization. It made sixty-one radio transmissions, initially at two-day intervals and later at five days, containing a large amount of interplanetary data. 

On March 21, 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of from Earth on its way to Mars, communications ceased, probably due to failure of the spacecraft&#x27;s antenna orientation system. Mars 1&#x27;s closest approach to Mars probably occurred on June 19, 1963 at a distance of approximately , after which the spacecraft entered an orbit around the Sun.

== Spacecraft design ==

Mars 1 was a modified Venera-type spacecraft in the shape of a cylinder long and in diameter. The spacecraft measured across with the solar panels and radiators deployed. The cylinder was divided into two compartments. The upper , the orbital module, contained guidance and on-board propulsion systems. The experiment module, containing the scientific instrumentation, comprised the bottom of the cylinder. A parabolic high gain antenna was used for communication, along with an omnidirectional antenna and a semi-directional antenna. Power was supplied by two solar panel wings with a total area of affixed to opposite sides of the spacecraft. Power was stored in a 42 ampere-hour cadmium-nickel battery.

Mars 1 was equipped with three primary radio systems operating at wavelengths of 1.6 meters, 32 centimeters, and in the centimeter range (5 and 8 centimeters). The 32-centimeter wavelength transmitter, situated in the orbital module, utilized a high-gain antenna, primarily transmitting on 922.76 MHz. It was supplemented by the 1.6-meter wavelength transmitter, linked with omnidirectional antennae on the solar panels, which operated on 183.6 MHz for downlink and likely near 102 MHz for uplink, serving both for telemetry and as a backup communication system in case of orientation system failure.

For detailed observations, the 8-centimeter wavelength transmitter in the experiment module was dedicated to transmitting television images, utilizing a signal coherent with the main 922.76 MHz link but at a higher frequency of 3691.04 MHz. Additionally, an impulse transmitter operating in the 5-centimeter band (around 5840-5890 MHz range) was also housed in the experiment module. This system, characterized by impulse modulation, was designed to transmit image data at approximately 90 pixels/sec using pulse-position modulation, with an average power consumption of 50 watts and peak power of 25 kilowatts per pulse.

The Mars 1 station was initially programmed for automatic data transmission every two days, later adjusted to every five days post December 13. Ground commands could also trigger transmissions from the station as required. 

Temperature control was achieved using a binary gas–liquid system and hemispherical radiators mounted on the ends of the solar panels. The craft carried various scientific instruments including a magnetometer probe, television photographic equipment, a spectroreflexometer, radiation sensors (gas-discharge and scintillation counters), a spectrograph to study ozone absorption bands, and a micrometeoroid instrument.

== Scientific results ==
* The probe recorded one micrometeorite strike every two minutes at altitudes ranging from from Earth&#x27;s surface due to the Taurids meteor shower, and also recorded similar densities at distances from from Earth.
* Magnetic field intensities of 3–4 nanoteslas (nT, also known as gammas) with peaks as high as 6–9 nT were measured in interplanetary space.
* The solar wind was detected. 
* The radiation zones around Earth were detected, and their magnitude confirmed.

== Designation ==
This spacecraft is also referenced as &quot;Sputnik 23&quot; and &quot;Mars 2MV-4&quot;. It was originally designated &quot;Sputnik 30&quot; in the U.S. Naval Space Command Satellite Situation Summary.

Although it was called Mars 1, there were at least three other probes prior to this, that were failures: Mars 2MV-4 No.1, Mars 1M No.2, and Mars 1M No.1

<text>Mars 2MV-3 No.1 also known as Sputnik 24 in the West, was a Soviet spacecraft, which was launched in 1962 as part of the Mars program, and was intended to land on the surface of Mars. Due to a problem with the rocket which launched it, it did not depart low Earth orbit, and it decayed several days later. It was the only Mars 2MV-3 spacecraft to be launched.

== Launch ==
The spacecraft was launched at 15:35:15 UTC on 4 November 1962, atop a Molniya 8K78 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. About 260 seconds into the flight, the oxidiser pressurisation system malfunctioned, resulting in cavitation within the feed lines and turbopump. The same problem developed in the propellant feed lines thirty-two seconds later. Although the lower stages of the rocket were still able to place the upper stage and payload into a low Earth orbit, vibrations caused by either the cavitation problem, or a separate problem with the next stage, caused a fuse to become dislodged in the electrical system controlling the upper stage engine. This prevented the Blok L upper stage igniting, leaving the spacecraft in its parking orbit. It decayed from orbit the next day. However, some debris remained in orbit until 27 December, and the upper stage ullage motor platform remained in orbit until 19 January 1963.

== Designation ==
The designations Sputnik 31, and later Sputnik 24, were used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart geocentric orbit.

<doc id="83219" wikidata="Q2249850" url="?curid=83219" title="Luna E-6 No.2">
<text>Luna E-6 No.2, also identified as No.1, and sometimes known in the West as Sputnik 25, was a Soviet spacecraft which launched in 1963, but was placed into a useless orbit due to a problem with the upper stage of the rocket that launched it. It was a Luna Ye-6 spacecraft, the first of twelve to be launched. It was intended to be the first spacecraft to perform a soft landing on the Moon, a goal which would eventually be accomplished by the final Ye-6 spacecraft, Luna 9.

There was a pause of almost three years between the last Luna E-3 attempts in 1960, both of which ended in failure, and the first E-6 launches. The crowded Soviet space schedule meant that no resources for lunar missions were available and plans for more advanced second-generation probes were delayed, especially as the goal of a soft landing on the Moon was a difficult one that many engineers were hesitant to tackle. The 8K72 booster used for the first generation Luna probes could only deliver 325 kg (716 pounds) to the Moon on an inaccurate direct ascent trajectory, and the E-6 probe would weigh a minimum of 1,500 kg (3,306 pounds) so it would require the new, more powerful 8K78 booster developed for the planetary missions, which also allowed a much more accurate parking orbit launch. As a further weight saving measure, the control system for the entire launch vehicle would be integrated into the probe itself. But the 8K78 had so far not accumulated any better launch record than the 8K72 and of ten 8K78 launches as 1962 ended, only two had not experienced a malfunction. Experience had shown that a given rocket or missile had to fly at least 20 times before the R&amp;D phase was over and it could be considered operational. The first E-6 probe was only completed and shipped to Baikonur in December 1962 and stacked on the booster, vehicle T103-09. Its estimated chance of success was about 10%.

Luna E-6 No.2 was launched at 08:49 UTC on 4 January 1963, atop a Molniya-L 8K78L carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The booster performed perfectly through orbital injection but there was no indication of Blok L start, which was supposed to take place while the stage was over the Gulf of Guinea, out of range of Soviet tracking stations. It was not clear why this happened, but one theory that was advanced held that leaking LOX during the coasting phase had caused an explosion when the engine was started. A tracking ship with a telemetry decoder hastily departed Odessa for the Gulf of Guinea. Data received from the Blok L determined that the engine did not receive the start commands from the control system. It was eventually concluded that the failure lay in failures of the carbonized brushes in the PT-500 converter inside the instrument compartment, which was filled with nitrogen and could cause the brushes to dry out. Ground testing was unable to replicate the exact in-flight environment but it was decided to add a small amount of water and oxygen to the container to keep the brushes slightly moistened. It remained in low Earth orbit until it decayed on 11 January 1963. It was the first spacecraft to be launched in 1963, and consequently the first to be assigned an International Designator, under the new system which had been introduced at the start of the year.

The spacecraft consisted of a cylindrical section containing rockets and fuel for maneuvering, attitude control and landing, as well as radio transmitters, and a instrumented probe, which would have been ejected onto the surface after the spacecraft landed, carrying a camera and devices to measure radiation. It was intended to return data on the mechanical characteristics of the lunar surface, the hazards presented by the topology — such as craters, rocks, and other obstructions — and radiation, in preparation for future crewed landings.

The designations Sputnik 33, and later Sputnik 25 were used by the United States Naval Space Command to identify the spacecraft in its Satellite Situation Summary documents, since the Soviet Union did not release the internal designations of its spacecraft at that time, and had not assigned it an official name due to its failure to depart geocentric orbit.

<text>NCR Voyix Corporation, previously known as NCR Corporation and National Cash Register, is an American software, consulting and technology company providing several professional services and electronic products. It manufactured self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, automated teller machines, check processing systems, and barcode scanners.

NCR was founded in Dayton, Ohio, in 1884. It grew to become a dominant market leader in cash registers, then decryption machinery, then computing machinery, and computers over the subsequent 100 years.
By 1991, it was still the fifth-largest manufacturer of computers. That year, it was acquired by AT&amp;T.

A restructuring of AT&amp;T in 1996 led to NCR&#x27;s re-establishment on January 1, 1997, as a separate company and involved the spin-off of Lucent Technologies from AT&amp;T. In June 2009, the company sold most of the Dayton properties and moved its headquarters to the Atlanta metropolitan area, near Duluth. In early January 2018, the new NCR Global Headquarters opened in Midtown Atlanta near Technology Square (adjacent to the Georgia Tech).

In October 2023, NCR Corporation was split into two independent public companies: NCR Voyix legally succeeded NCR Corporation, while the ATM business was spun-off as NCR Atleos.

==History==

===Early years===
 
The company began as the National Manufacturing Company of Dayton, Ohio, and was established to manufacture and sell the first mechanical cash register invented in 1879 by James Ritty. In 1884, the company and patents were bought by John Henry Patterson and his brother Frank Jefferson Patterson, and the firm was renamed the National Cash Register Company. Patterson formed NCR into one of the first modern American companies by introducing new, aggressive sales methods and business techniques. He established the first sales training school in 1893 and introduced a comprehensive social welfare program for his factory workers.

Other significant figures in the early history of the company were Thomas J. Watson, Sr., Charles F. Kettering and Edward A. Deeds.

Watson—later fired by Patterson in 1914—eventually worked his way up to general sales manager. At an uninspiring sales meeting, Watson interrupted, saying &quot;The trouble with every one of us is that we don&#x27;t think enough. We don&#x27;t get paid for working with our feet — we get paid for working with our heads&quot;. Watson then wrote THINK on the easel. Signs with this motto were later erected in NCR factory buildings, sales offices and club rooms during the mid-1890s. &quot;THINK&quot; later became a widely known symbol of IBM, which was created by Watson after he joined the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR).

Kettering designed the first cash register powered by an electric motor in 1906. Within a few years he developed the Class 1000 register which was in production for 40 years, and the O.K. Telephone Credit Authorization system for verifying credit in department stores.

Deeds and Kettering went on to found Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company which later became the Delco Electronics Division of General Motors.

In 1913, the company&#x27;s market share was dominant and it was successfully prosecuted under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The ruling was appealed and executives avoided at least some of the court&#x27;s strictures.

===American Selling Force===

When John H. Patterson and his brother took over the company, cash registers were expensive (US$50) and only about a dozen of &quot;Ritty&#x27;s Incorruptible Cashier&quot; machines were in use. There was little demand for the expensive device, but Patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks. He created a sales team known as the &quot;American Selling Force&quot; which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script, the &quot;N.C.R. Primer.&quot; This was the first known sales training manual in existence. The philosophy was to sell a business function rather than just a piece of machinery. Sales demonstrations were set up in hotels (away from the distractions of the buyer&#x27;s business) depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash. The sale prospect was described as the &quot;P.P.&quot; or &quot;Probable Purchaser.&quot; Once initial objections were swept aside and the P.P. admitted to internal theft losses, the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams. The deal was sealed with a 25 cent cigar.

Patterson also invented the formal sales training academy, a summer event first set up in canvas tents and called &quot;Sugar Camp.&quot; The first known form of direct mail advertising also came courtesy of Patterson, who sent mail pieces to a predetermined list of addresses about his products. Patterson&#x27;s &quot;Get a Receipt&quot; campaign was one of the world&#x27;s first advertising campaigns.

=== Welfare work ===
NCR undertook extensive welfare work and was referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s model factory.&quot; Some historians have referred to company owner John Patterson as the &quot;father of industrial welfare.&quot; The company had its own welfare department and is considered a pioneer in America for this work.

Some of the company&#x27;s welfare initiatives include safety devices, drinking fountains, baths, lockers, chairs and back support for machine operators, indoor bathrooms and a ventilation system to provide clean air. There were special provisions for female employees including restrooms, shorter work hours, high-back chairs, a women&#x27;s dining room, and lessons in domestic science. In 1893, NCR constructed the first &quot;daylight factory&quot; buildings with floor-to-ceiling glass windows that let in light and could be opened to let in fresh air as well.

===Expansion===
NCR expanded quickly and became multi-national in 1888. Between 1893 and 1906 it acquired a number of smaller cash register companies.

By 1911 it had sold one million machines and had grown to almost 6,000 employees. Combined with rigorous legal attacks, Patterson&#x27;s methods enabled the company to fight off bankruptcy, buy-out over 80 of its early competitors, and achieve control of 95% of the U.S. market.

In 1912 the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Deeds, Watson and 25 other NCR executives and managers were convicted of illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public due to the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio, floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.

In 1918, the company signed a contract with the US Army to produce 100,000 M1911 pistols for use in World War I. The contract was canceled a few months later after the war ended, with no pistols having been delivered.
Two million units were sold by 1922, the year John Patterson died. In January, 1926, NCR went public with an issue of $55 million in stock, at that time the largest public offering in United States history. During the first World War, NCR manufactured fuses and aircraft instrumentation, and during World War II built aero-engines, bomb sights and code-breaking machines, including the American bombe designed by Joseph Desch.

====US Navy Bombe, code breaking machine====
The US Navy Bombe was built by NCR for the United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory to decrypt the Enigma machine that encrypted German military messages.

The NCR-made American bombes (decryption machines) were faster, and soon more available, than the British bombes at Bletchley Park and its outstations. 
The American bombe was essentially the same as the English bombe, though it functioned better (six times faster) as they were not handicapped by having to make it, as Keen was forced to do owing to production difficulties, on the framework of a three-wheel machine. By late autumn 1943, new American machines were coming into action at the rate of about two a week, the ultimate total being in the region of 125.

===Post-war===

Building on its wartime experience with secret communication systems, high speed counters and cryptanalytic equipment, NCR became a major post-war force in developing new computing and communications technology.

In 1953, chemists Barrett K. Green and Lowell Schleicher of NCR in Dayton submitted a patent &quot;Pressure responsive record materials&quot; for a carbon-less copy paper. This became US Patent 2,730,457 and was commercialized as &quot;NCR Paper.&quot;

In February 1953, the company acquired the Computer Research Corporation (CRC), after which it created a specialized electronics division. In 1956, NCR introduced its first electronic device, the Class 29 Post-Tronic, a bank machine using magnetic stripe technology. With the General Electric Company (now known as GE), the company manufactured its first transistor-based computer in 1957, the NCR 304. Also in the 1950s NCR introduced MICR (magnetic ink character recognition) and the NCR 3100 accounting machines.

In 1962, NCR introduced the NCR 315 Electronic Data Processing System which included the CRAM storage device, the first automated mass storage alternative to magnetic tape libraries accessed manually by computer operators. The NCR 390 and 500 computers were also offered to customers who did not need the full power of the 315. The NCR 390 accepted four types of input: magnetic ledger cards, punched cards, punched tape, and keyboard entry, with a tape read speed of 400 characters a second.
The company&#x27;s first all-integrated circuit computer was the Century 100 of 1968. The Century 200 was added in 1970. The line was extended through the Century 300 in 1973. The Century series was followed by the Criterion series in 1976, NCR&#x27;s first virtual machine system.

During this period, NCR also produced the 605 minicomputer for in-house use. It was the compute engine for the 399 and 499 accounting machines, several generations of in-store and in-bank controllers, and the 82xx/90xx IMOS COBOL systems. The 605 also powered peripheral controllers, including the 658 disk subsystem and the 721 communications processor.

In 1974, scanners and computers developed by NCR marked the first occasion where items with the Universal Product Code (UPC) was scanned at the checkout of a supermarket, Troy&#x27;s Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio, a few miles away from NCR&#x27;s Dayton Headquarters. It was treated as a ceremonial occasion and involved a little bit of ritual. The night before, a team of Marsh&#x27;s supermarket staff had moved in to put bar codes on hundreds of items in the store while NCR installed their scanners and computers.

In 1982, NCR&#x27;s Peripheral Products Division in Wichita, Kansas, together with peripheral manufacturer, Shugart Associates, helped propel the computer industry into a new era of intelligent standardized peripheral communications with the development the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI). The SCSI standard enabled such diverse devices as disks, tapes, printers, and scanners to share a common interface to one or more computer systems in a way that was never before possible and a model for subsequent interfaces to follow. NCR developed the world&#x27;s first SCSI interface chip, the NCR 5380, based on the SCSI interface standard collaboratively developed. In the third quarter of 1982, NCR announced the release of a 32-bit VLSI processor architecture and chipset called NCR/32. These devices were used in several of their 9x00 and System 10000 computer systems.

By 1986, the count of American mainframe computer manufacturers had dwindled from 8 (IBM and the &quot;seven dwarfs,&quot; namely Burroughs, UNIVAC, NCR, Control Data, Honeywell, General Electric, and RCA) to 6 (IBM and the &quot;BUNCH&quot;) and further reduced to 4 (IBM, Unisys, NCR, and Control Data Corporation).

The adoption of the name NCR Corporation occurred in 1974.

===Small computers===

In 1982, NCR became involved in open systems architecture. Its first such system was the UNIX-powered TOWER 16/32, the success of which (approximately 100,000 were sold) established NCR as a pioneer in bringing industry standards and open systems architecture to the computer market. These 5000-series systems were based on Motorola 68k CPUs and supported NCR&#x27;s proprietary transaction processing system TMX, which was mainly used by financial institutions. This product line also saw the first time NCR had offered its products through other than its own direct sales channels since the early 1900s. Formally added to its company structure in March 1981, NCR&#x27;s OEM System&#x27;s Division spearheaded the design, sales revenue and market awareness and acceptance of NCR&#x27;s Tower family. Part of the cause of this success was the decision by NCR senior management to hire reseller industry veterans for key positions within the fledgling operation and have that unit work with, but not answerable to, NCR&#x27;s traditional management structure. The industry shift from proprietary minicomputers brought personnel with minicomputer and reseller backgrounds such as division heads Roger Nielsen (ex-Data General), Robert Hahn (ex-Data General), and Dan Kiegler (ex-Datapoint marketing), marketing manager and later Director of Field Sales, Dave Lang (ex-DEC reseller marketing director and salesperson) and other critical contributors at corporate levels; who then hired a complementary field sales organization primarily made up of proven people from DEC, Wang and other faltering minicomputer firms.

In the 1980s, NCR sold various PC compatible AT-class computers, like the small NCR-3390 (called an &quot;intelligent terminal&quot;). They proposed a customized version of MS-DOS named NCR-DOS, which for example offered support for switching the CPU between 6, 8 or 10 MHz speeds. The computers featured an improved CGA adapter, the NGA, which had a 640×400 text mode more suitable for business uses than the original 640×200 mode, with characters drawn using single-pixel-wide lines, giving an appearance similar to that of classic IBM 3270 terminals. The additional four-color 640×400 graphical mode was identical to CGA&#x27;s 320×200 mode from a programming point of view.

NCR also manufactured two proprietary series of mini-to-midrange computers:

* I-Series: 9010 (IDPS Operating System), 9020 and 9100 (IMOS Operating System), 9040 and 9050 (IRX Operating System), 9200 / 9300 / 9300IP / 9400 / 9400IP / 9500 / System 10000 models 35 / 55 / 65 / 75 (ITX Operating System). These were &quot;I&quot; (Interactive) computers allowing TTY terminals to be connected. Later models supported all industry-standard communication protocols.
* V-Series: 8500 (VRX Operating System) and 9800 (VRX/E Operating System). These were &quot;V&quot; series, comparable to mainframes, supporting &quot;Page mode&quot; terminals. The hardware did have similarities with the I-Series while the operating system and user interface was totally different.

In 1990, NCR introduced the System 3000, a seven-level family of computers based on Intel&#x27;s 386 and 486 CPUs. The majority of the System 3000 range utilised IBM&#x27;s Micro Channel architecture rather than the more prevalent ISA architecture, and utilised SCSI peripherals as well as the more popular parallel and serial port interfaces, resulting in a premium product with premium pricing. The 3600, through NCR subsidiary Applied Digital Data Systems supported both the Pick Operating System and Prime Information.

The 1970s saw the widespread installations of the Model 770 in National Westminster and Barclays banks throughout the UK, but it was not until the Model 5070, developed at its Dundee plant in Scotland and introduced in 1983 that the company began to make more serious inroads into the ATM market. Subsequent models included the 5084, and 58xx (Personas) series. In early 2008, the company launched its new generation of ATMs—the 662x/663x SelfServ series. NCR currently commands over a third of the entire ATM market, with an estimated $18 trillion being withdrawn from NCR ATMs every year. In addition, NCR&#x27;s expertise in this field led the company to contract with the U.S. military to support the Eagle Cash program with customized ATMs.

====NCR 5xxx series====
The NCR 5xxx-series is the range of (ATMs) produced by NCR from the early 1980s. Most models were designed and initially manufactured at its Dundee factory in Scotland, but later produced at several other locations around the world.

There have been several distinct generations:
* 50xx-series; The initial models introduced in 1983 were the 5070 (interior vestibule) and 5080 (Through The Wall or TTW) introduced a number of features which have become standard among ATMs. Most notably, the individual functions of the ATM are divided among discrete modules which can be easily removed and replaced for repair or replenishment. The 5080 featured the standard anti-vandal smoked perspex screen which covered the keypad and screen until the cardholder inserted their card. The enhanced 5084 TTW model appeared in 1987, and had an improved anti-vandal fascia and was the first ATM to dispense with the need for the retracting perspex screen. The 5085 offered the first crude deposit function; with the machine supplying the deposit envelopes which were subsequently stored in the machine&#x27;s safe for subsequent back office processing.
* 56xx-series; produced from 1991 to 1997. Enhanced functions such as color displays and improved security and usability functions became available. The introduction of Media Entry Indicators (MEI) which highlight the card entry slot to the customer was also a part of this series. Some 56xx machines produced between 1994 and 1996 were badged as &quot;AT&amp;T&quot; rather than &quot;NCR&quot;, mirroring the company&#x27;s brief ownership under the telecoms giant in the mid-1990s. 56xx models have included the 5670 (interior lobby cash dispense only), 5675 (interior lobby multifunction—dispense &amp; deposit), 5684 (exterior TTW dispense only), 5688 (exterior TTW drive-up multifunction) and 5685 (exterior TTW multifunction).
* 58xx-series marketed as Personas from 1998 until 2008. These models were characterised by the gradual move towards greater ATM functionality including intelligent, envelopeless deposit by means of automated check recognition modules, coin dispense, and electronic cash recognition functions which allows bank customers to deposit cash and checks with instant processing of the transaction. The 58xx series has also been characterised by the gradual introduction of LCD displays instead of the traditional CRT monitor. Models have included the 5870 (compact interior lobby dispense only), 5873 (interior lobby with cash accept &amp; deposit only), 5874 (Exterior TTW cash dispense), 5875 (Multifunction TTW). The latest TTW versions of the Personas line, introduced in 2000 and marketed as M-Series added functions such as cash recycling, coin dispense, barcode reading, a larger 12&quot; LCD display with touchscreen option, and for the first time, a common wall footprint for both the Multifunction (5886) or single function (5887). Owing to the growth of drive-through bank traffic, a custom 5890 drive-up ATM was also released, designed to be installed outside with no need for a bunker. This unit had a dual safe design that could house both a currency dispenser and note acceptor in the larger left-hand safe, and a cheque acceptor or envelope depositor in the smaller right-hand safe.

====NCR 66XX series====
NCR&#x27;s 6th generation of ATMs have been noted for the further move towards intelligent deposit and the expansion of secondary functions such as barcode reading.
* 667x-series marketed under the Personas M-Series brand were sold from 2005 to 2010. These models consist of the 6676 (interior lobby multifunction) and 6674 (through-the-wall multifunction). The design language is very different from the original Personas model; for example, on the front-access 6676s, the entire front cover is opened upwards in a clamshell design, which was designed to save space both for installation and servicing.

====NCR Self-Serv 20 and 30 series====
NCR&#x27;s latest ATM services, introduced in 2008.

This series is a complete redesign of both outlook and technological contents. It is also a cost down product.

Self-Serv 20 series are single-function (e.g. cash-out) ATMs, while Self-Serv 30 series are full-function (cash-out and intelligent deposit) machines.

====NCR Atleos 668x / 20xx machines====
Starting in 2015, the SelfServ series was updated with new design language (called MFR or Multi-Function Refresh), modernizing the look of the product line. This corresponded with a change in class numbers, from the 20/30 series to the 80 Series (6681 kiosk model, 6682 lobby model, 6684 through-the-wall model, and 6688 island / drive-through model).

Next-generation dispensers, depositors, high-resolution display panels and anti-skimming technology are all standard with the MFR units.

In 2021, the 206x and 208x line of products was released, incorporating cash recycling technology.

===AT&amp;T===

==== Acquisition by AT&amp;T ====
NCR was acquired by AT&amp;T Corporation on September 19, 1991, for $7.4 billion and was joined with Teradata Corporation on February 28, 1992. As an AT&amp;T subsidiary, its 1992 year-end headcount was 53,800 employees and contractors. By 1993, the subsidiary produced a year-end $1.287 billion net loss on $7.265 billion in revenue. The net losses continued in 1994 and 1995, losses that required repeated subsidies from the parent company and resulted in a 1995 year-end headcount of 41,100. During these three years, AT&amp;T was the former NCR&#x27;s largest customer, accounting for over $1.5 billion in revenue.

On February 15, 1995, the company sold its microelectronics division and storage systems division to Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix) who renamed it Symbios Logic. At the time it was the largest purchase of an American company by a Korean company.

For a while, starting in 1994, the subsidiary was renamed AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, but in 1995, AT&amp;T decided to spin off the company, and at the start of 1996, changed its name back to NCR in preparation for the spin-off. The company outlined its reasons for the spin-off in an Information Statement sent to its stockholders, which cited, in addition to &quot;changes in customer needs&quot; and &quot;need for focused management time and attention&quot;, the following:
:...[A]dvantages of vertical integration [which had motivated ATT&#x27;s earlier acquisition of NCR] are outweighed by its costs and disadvantages...[T]o varying degrees, many of the actual and potential customers of Lucent and NCR are or will be competitors of AT&amp;T&#x27;s communications services businesses. NCR believes that its efforts to target the communications industry have been hindered by the reluctance of AT&amp;T&#x27;s communications services competitors to make purchases from an AT&amp;T subsidiary.

The newly renamed NCR commissioned the renowned graphic designer Saul Bass to design its new logo and corporate identity as one of his final projects before his death in April 1996, and subsequently re-emerged as a stand-alone company on January 1, 1997.

==== Teradata merger and spin-off ====
NCR had partnered with Teradata in 1990. After AT&amp;T acquired NCR, it also acquired Teradata and made into a unit of NCR. Mark Hurd took over the company&#x27;s Teradata division in 1999 and is credited with expanding NCR&#x27;s Teradata business. Hurd streamlined operations and invested in research. The Teradata division at NCR became profitable in 2002. In 2007, NCR split Teradata into its own company.

===Independence===

One of NCR&#x27;s first significant acquisitions after becoming independent from AT&amp;T came in July 1997, when it purchased Compris Technologies, a privately held company in Kennesaw, Georgia that produced software for restaurant chains. In November 1997, NCR purchased Dataworks Inc., a 60-person privately held company in San Antonio, Texas.

The Montgomery County Historical Society and NCR Corporation joined in 1998 into a partnership committed to preserving the historic and voluminous NCR Archive. In 1999, NCR moved an estimated three million items from NCR&#x27;s Building 28 into the Historical Society&#x27;s Research Center.

In 1998, NCR sold its computer hardware manufacturing assets to Solectron and ceased to produce general-purpose computer systems, focusing instead on the retail and financial industries. In 2000, NCR acquired customer relationship management provider Ceres Integrated Solutions and services company 4Front Technologies. Recent acquisitions include self-service companies Kinetics, InfoAmerica and Galvanon, and software company DecisionPoint.

In April 2003, NCR purchased Copient Technologies, an Indiana-based retail marketing software company.

CEO Lars Nyberg announced his resignation from the company in February 2003 in order to address family matters. NCR promoted Mark Hurd to replace Nyberg as CEO in March 2003. Early on in his new role, Hurd made changes in order to cut costs, including layoffs and converting an executive parking lot into an ATM training center. Within his first year as CEO, the company&#x27;s stock doubled and NCR became a market leader in ultra high-end data-warehousing software.

=== Bill Nuti&#x27;s management ===

In 2006, NCR acquired software company IDVelocity and the ATM manufacturing division of Tidel, a cash security equipment manufacturer specializing in retail markets.

On January 8, 2007, NCR announced its intention to separate into two independent companies by spinning off Teradata to shareholders. Bill Nuti would continue his role as president and CEO of NCR, while Teradata Senior VP Mike Koehler would assume leadership of Teradata. On October 1, 2007, NCR Corporation and Teradata jointly announced the Teradata business unit spin-off was complete, with Michael Koehler as the first CEO of Teradata.

On January 11, 2007, NCR announced plans to restructure its entire ATM manufacturing operations, with 650 jobs at its Dundee plant being cut. A further 450 jobs were cut in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. In 2009, the Dundee manufacturing facility was closed, along with plants in São Paulo and Budapest, citing global economic conditions.

NCR extended its self-service portfolio into the digital media market with the January 2007 announcement of NCR Xpress Entertainment, a multichannel entertainment kiosk. NCR&#x27;s acquisition of Touch Automation LLC was announced on December 31, 2007.

On October 15, 2008, NCR announced a global reseller partnership with Experticity, a Seattle based software company.

In 2009, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from Dayton, Ohio to near Duluth, Georgia; Dayton had served as NCR&#x27;s home for 125 years.

In 2009, NCR became the second largest DVD Kiosk operator in North America with the acquisitions of The New Release and DVD Play. In 2010, NCR completed the acquisition of digital signage company, Netkey.

In August 2011, NCR purchased Radiant Systems, a hospitality and retail systems company, for US$1.2 billion. Radiant&#x27;s hospitality division turned into a new Hospitality Line of Business within NCR. Radiant&#x27;s petroleum and convenience retail business became part of its retail line of business. Several Radiant executives remained on board, including Scott Kingsfield, who was a general manager of NCR&#x27;s Retail Line of Business and left NCR in 2014, and Andy Heyman, who became general manager of NCR&#x27;s Financial Services line of business.

In August 2012, the company was hit with charges of avoiding U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, greatly affecting its stock price.

In February 2013, NCR completed its acquisition of Retalix (NASDAQ: RTLX), a provider of retail software and services, for approximately $650 million in cash.

In January 2014, NCR completed its acquisition of Digital Insight Corporation, a provider of online and mobile banking to mid-market financial institutions, from equity firm Thoma Bravo, LLC for $1.65 billion in cash.

In September 2016, Mark Benjamin was named president and chief operating officer of NCR. Benjamin is a 24-year veteran of human resources management and will report directly to Bill Nuti.

=== Relocation and split-off ===
In January 2018, NCR relocated its corporate headquarters from near Duluth, Georgia to a new office in Midtown Atlanta. NCR&#x27;s mailing address is 864 Spring St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308.

In April 2018, Mike Hayford was named CEO. He led the company&#x27;s strategic shift from hardware provider to software- and services-led enterprise technology provider.

In October 2018, NCR announced an agreement to purchase payment processor JetPay. This has allowed NCR to offer unified POS and payment packages to SMBs.

In 2019, NCR announced plans to start building a campus in Belgrade, Serbia.

In January 2021, NCR reached an agreement to acquire ATM operator Cardtronics in a deal valued at $2.5 billion.

In October 2021, NCR&#x27;s largest IT center and campus in Europe was opened in New Belgrade, Serbia.

On September 16, 2022, NCR announced it would split its Digital Commerce and ATM businesses in two separate companies. The split was completed on October 16, 2023. Their names were unveiled on July 24, 2023, with Digital Commerce business being named NCR Voyix and ATM business being named NCR Atleos.

On August 6, 2024, NCR Voyix announced a definitive agreement to sell its cloud-based digital banking business to Veritas Capital for $2.45 Billion. The transaction was approved by NCR Voyix&#x27;s board of directors and is expected to close by year-end 2024, but remains subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. The digital-first banking platform was a pioneer in online and mobile banking.

<text>Kosmos 21 ( meaning &quot;Cosmos 21&quot;) was a Soviet spacecraft. This mission has been tentatively identified by NASA as a technology test of the Venera series space probes. It may have been an attempted Venus impact, presumably similar to the later Kosmos 27 mission, or it may have been intended from the beginning to remain in geocentric orbit. In any case, the spacecraft never left Earth orbit after insertion by the Molniya launcher. The orbit decayed on 14 November 1963, three days after launch.

== Launch ==
Kosmos 21 was launched at 06:23:34 GMT on 11 November 1963, atop a Molniya 8K78 s/n G103-18 carrier rocket flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

== Spacecraft designation ==
Beginning in 1963, the name Kosmos was given to Soviet spacecraft which remained in Earth orbit, regardless of whether that was their intended final destination. The designation of this mission as an intended planetary probe is based on evidence from Soviet and non-Soviet sources and historical documents. Typically Soviet planetary missions were initially put into an Earth parking orbit as a launch platform with a rocket engine and attached probe. The probes were then launched toward their targets with an engine burn with a duration of roughly 4 minutes. If the engine misfired or the burn was not completed, the probes would be left in Earth orbit and given a Kosmos designation.

The spacecraft&#x27;s original development name before being given the Kosmos 21 denomination once it reached orbit was 3MV-1 No.1.

This was the first &quot;third-generation&quot; deep space planetary probes of the 3MV series of the Soviet Union. Like the second generation, Soviet engineers planned four types of the 3MV, the 3MV-1 (for Venus impact), 3MV-2 (for Venus flyby), 3MV-3 (for Mars impact), and 3MV-4 (for Mars flyby). The primary difference over the second-generation was vastly improved (and in many cases doubled) orientation system elements as well as improved onboard propulsion systems. While these four versions were meant to study Mars and Venus, the Soviets conceived of two additional variants of the series, similar but not
identical to the 3MV-1 and 3MV-4 versions, with the designations 3MV-1A and 3MV-4A.

These &quot;Object-Probes&quot; (ob&#x27;yekt-zond) were designed to verify key technological systems during simpler missions into deep space and back to Earth. A government decree on 21 March 1963 had approved two to three such &quot;object-probe&quot; missions, one of which (a 3MV-1A) was designed to depart from Earth&#x27;s ecliptic (the orbital plane of Earth around the Sun) out to 12–16 million kilometers from Earth and then return to Earth after about six months when its orbit intersected with that of Earth again, aided by two mid-course corrections using its S5.45 main engine. The latter, capable of two firings, was a lighter version of that used on the 2MV model with higher specific impulse and longer burn time.

==Mission==
During this mission, the third and fourth stages separated abnormally, and after reaching Earth orbit, ground control lost telemetry (at 06:45:44 GMT) from the Blok L upper stage designed to send the vehicle past the Moon. As a result, the spacecraft remained stranded in Earth orbit. The main engine turbopump of stage probably exploded upon ignition destroying the spacecraft. On 11 November 1963, it had a perigee of and an apogee of , with an inclination of 64.8°, and an orbital period of 88.5 minutes. The spacecraft was decay on 14 November 1963. With this mission, the Soviets began the practice of giving Kosmos designations to obscure the failure of lunar and planetary probes that remained stranded in Earth orbit. If the spacecraft had successfully departed from Earth orbit, it would probably have been called Zond 1.

<text>The Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) was a NASA &quot;Discovery&quot;-class space probe that failed shortly after its July 2002 launch. It was the only Discovery mission to fail.

The two comets scheduled to be visited were Encke and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3, and the third target was d&#x27;Arrest. It was hoped that a new comet would have been discovered in the inner Solar System between 2006 and 2008, in which case the spacecraft trajectory would have been changed if possible to rendezvous with the new comet. Scientific objectives included imaging the nuclei at resolutions of up to , performing spectral mapping of the nuclei at resolutions of up to , and obtaining detailed compositional data on gas and dust in the near-nucleus environment, with the goal of improving knowledge of the characteristics of comet nuclei.

After the solid rocket motor intended to inject the spacecraft into solar orbit was ignited on August 15, 2002, contact with the probe could not be re-established. Ground-based telescopes later found three objects along the course of the satellite, leading to the speculation that it had disintegrated. Attempts to contact the probe were ended on December 20, 2002. The probe thus accomplished none of its primary scientific objectives, but did prove some spaceflight technologies, such as the APL-developed non-coherent Doppler tracking spacecraft navigation technique, which was later used on the New Horizons spacecraft.

==Spacecraft==
===Design and construction===
The &quot;CONTOUR&quot; spacecraft was constructed in-house at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. &quot;CONTOUR&quot; was shaped as an octagonal prism, measuring at tall and long, had a total fueled mass of at launch, not including the mass of the Star 30 booster it was attached to, during the launch phase of the mission. The spacecraft was fitted with a whipple shield, similar to the one used on &quot;Stardust&quot;, on its leading face, designed with four layers of nextel fabric and seven layers of kevlar. The shield was built to allow the spacecraft to withstand the respective 28.2 and 14 km/s velocity flybys of comets Encke and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3, where the spacecraft would be subjected to numerous particles ejecting from the nuclei of the comets. Although mission scientists predicted that the spacecraft would take no significant damage during the Encke and Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 encounters, the shield and its prototypes were tested vigorously during the construction of the spacecraft, including one where a shield prototype was shot at with surrogate nylon particles from a two stage light-gas gun. The results of the earlier tests allowed mission planners to determine a safe distance from which the &quot;CONTOUR&quot; would pass by comets targeted on the mission. Three of the four scientific instruments aboard the spacecraft were embedded within this shield.

===Spacecraft subsystems===

====Power====
Power for &quot;CONTOUR&quot; derives from solar cells, which are mounted onto the spacecraft, decorating the sides and rear and generating up to 670 watts of power. A nickel–cadmium battery designed to last up to nine ampere hours was also installed aboard the spacecraft in the event that the solar cell system fails, or does not provide enough power for the spacecraft or its instruments to function.

====Communications and data====

====Propulsion and guidance====
Unlike many interplanetary missions, CONTOUR was not designed to be propelled beyond Earth orbit by the rocket that launched it, instead it exited Earth orbit using a STAR-30 solid rocket booster built into the spacecraft. This STAR-30 engine provided 1,922 meters per second of delta-v. The firing of this engine is the reason the CONTOUR spacecraft was destroyed. In addition, there were 16 hydrazine thrusters for normal propulsion and course corrections. These thrusters were divided into four clusters of four.

===Scientific payload===
* CIDA
:The Comet Impact Dust Analyzer (CIDA)

* CRISP
:The CONTOUR Remote Imager/Spectrograph (CRISP)

* CAI
:The CONTOUR Aft Imager (CAI), also known as the CONTOUR Forward Imager (CFI)

* NGIMS
:Neutral Gas Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS)

==Mission==

CONTOUR launched on a Delta 7425 (a Delta II Lite launch vehicle with four strap-on solid-rocket boosters and a Star 27 third stage) on July 3, 2002, at 6:47:41 UT (2:47:41 a.m. EDT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It was launched into a high-apogee Earth orbit with a period of 5.5 days. Following a series of phasing orbits, the Star 30 solid rocket motor was used to perform an injection maneuver on August 15, 2002, to put CONTOUR in the proper trajectory for an Earth flyby on August 15, 2003, followed by an encounter with comet Encke on November 12, 2003, at a distance of 100 to 160 km and a flyby speed of 28.2 km/s, 1.07 AU from the Sun and 0.27 AU from Earth. During the August 2002 injection maneuver, the probe was lost.

Three more Earth flybys would have followed, on August 14, 2004, February 10, 2005, and February 10, 2006. On June 18, 2006, CONTOUR would have encountered comet Schwassmann-Wachmann-3 at 14 km/s, 0.95 AU from the Sun and 0.33 AU from Earth. Two more Earth flybys were scheduled in February 2007 and 2008, and a flyby of comet d&#x27;Arrest might have occurred on 16 August 2008 at a relative velocity of 11.8 km/s, 1.35 AU from the Sun and 0.36 AU from Earth. All flybys would have had a closest encounter distance of about 100 km and would have occurred near the period of maximum activity for each comet. After the comet Encke encounter, CONTOUR might have been retargeted towards a new comet if one was discovered with the desired characteristics (e.g. active, brighter than absolute magnitude 10, perihelion within 1.5 AU).
==Investigation into failure==
According to NASA: &quot;An investigation board concluded that the most likely cause of the mishap was structural failure of the spacecraft due to plume heating during the solid-rocket motor burn. Alternate possible but less likely causes determined were catastrophic failure of the solid rocket motor, collision with space debris, and loss of dynamic control of the spacecraft.&quot;

==Proposed reflight==
After the loss of CONTOUR, a replacement spacecraft – CONTOUR 2 – was proposed, scheduled for launch in 2006. However, the replacement did not ultimately materialize.

<doc id="83236" wikidata="Q170345" url="?curid=83236" title="Kees van Dongen">
<text>Cornelis Theodorus Maria &quot;Kees&quot; van Dongen (26 January 1877 – 28 May 1968) was a Dutch-French painter who was one of the leading Fauves. Van Dongen&#x27;s early work was influenced by the Hague School and symbolism and it evolved gradually into a rough pointillist style. From 1905 onwards – when he took part at the controversial 1905 Salon d&#x27;Automne exhibition – his style became more and more radical in its use of form and colour. The paintings he made in the period of 1905–1910 are considered by some to be his most important works. The themes of his work from that period are predominantly centered on the nightlife. He painted dancers, singers, masquerades, and theatre. Van Dongen gained a reputation for his sensuous – at times garish – portraits, especially of women.

== Life and work ==
Kees van Dongen was born in Delfshaven, then on the outskirts, and today a borough, of Rotterdam. He was the second of four children in a middle-class family. In 1892, at age 16, Kees van Dongen started his studies at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Rotterdam, working with J. Striening and J.G. Heyberg. During this period (1892–97), Van Dongen frequented the Red Quarter seaport area, where he drew scenes of sailors and prostitutes. He met Augusta Preitinger at the Academy, a fellow painter.
In 1897, Van Dongen lived in Paris for several months, where there was a large emigre community. In December 1899, he returned from Rotterdam to Paris, where Preitinger had moved before him and found work.

== Marriage and family ==
He returned to join Augusta Preitinger (&quot;Guus&quot;), whom he had met at the Academy. They married on 11 July 1901. They had two children together: a son died a couple of days after birth in December 1901; their daughter Augusta, called &quot;Dolly&quot;, was born 18 April 1905. Around that time, Van Dongen produced a painting of Fernande Olivier, which was the reason why — according to Gertrude Stein in her 1933 book &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas&quot; — he &quot;broke into notoriety&quot;. Apparently, according to Stein:
Guus took Dolly to see their families in Rotterdam in the summer of 1914, where they were caught by the outbreak of World War I. They were not able to return to Paris until 1918. Preitinger and Van Dongen divorced in 1921.

In 1917, Van Dongen had become involved with a married socialite, the fashion director Léa Alvin, also known as Jasmy Jacob. Their relationship lasted until 1927.

== Career ==
Van Dongen began to exhibit in Paris, and participated in the controversial 1905 Salon d&#x27;Automne exhibition along with Henri Matisse, André Derain, Albert Marquet, Maurice de Vlaminck, Charles Camoin, and Jean Puy. The bright colours of this group of artists led to them being called &quot;Fauves&quot; (&#x27;Wild Beasts&#x27;) by art critic Louis Vauxcelles. Van Dongen was also briefly a member of the German Expressionist group &quot;Die Brücke.&quot;

In these years, he was part of an avant-garde wave of painters, including Maurice de Vlaminck, Othon Friesz, Henri Rousseau, Robert Delaunay, Albert Marquet, Édouard Vuillard, who aspired to a renewal of painting which they thought was stuck in neo-impressionism.

In 1906, Preitinger and Van Dongen moved to the Bateau Lavoir at 13 rue Ravignan in Montmartre, where they were friends with the circle surrounding Pablo Picasso and his girlfriend Fernande Olivier.
He taught at the Académie Vitti in 1912.

In addition to selling his paintings, Van Dongen also gained an income by selling satirical sketches to the newspaper &quot;Revue Blanche.&quot; He also organised very successful costume balls in Montparnasse, to which people paid admission, to gain extra income.

After the First World War, under the influence of his companion, the fashion director Lea Alvin (Jasmy Jacob), among others, Van Dongen developed the lush colours of his Fauvist style. This earned him a solid reputation with the French bourgeoisie and upper class, where he was in demand for his portraits. As a fashionable portraitist, he was commissioned for subjects including Arletty, Louis Barthou, Sacha Guitry, Leopold III of Belgium, Anna de Noailles, Madame Grès and Maurice Chevalier.

With a playful cynicism he remarked of his popularity as a portraitist with high society women, &quot;The essential thing is to elongate the women and especially to make them slim. After that it just remains to enlarge their jewels. They are ravished.&quot; This remark is reminiscent of another of his sayings: &quot;Painting is the most beautiful of lies&quot;.

In 1957, Kay Thompson featured one of his paintings in her book &quot;Eloise in Paris&quot;.

The social and commercial appeal of his later work (such as a 1959 portrait of Brigitte Bardot in a little black dress, with her hair tousled) did not match the artistic promise or the bohemian eroticism of his first three decades of work.

From 1959, Kees van Dongen lived in Monaco. He died in his home in Monte Carlo in 1968. An extensive collection of van Dongen&#x27;s work is held by the New National Museum of Monaco. His work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="83237" wikidata="Q220450" url="?curid=83237" title="David Gemmell">
<text>David Andrew Gemmell (; 1 August 1948 – 28 July 2006) was a British author of heroic fantasy, best known for his debut novel, &quot;Legend&quot;. A former journalist and newspaper editor, Gemmell had his first work of fiction published in 1984. He went on to write over thirty novels. Gemmell&#x27;s works display violence, yet also explore themes of honour, loyalty and redemption. There is always a strong heroic theme but nearly always the heroes are flawed in some way. With over one million copies sold, his work continues to sell worldwide.

The David Gemmell Awards for Fantasy were awarded from 2009 to 2018, with a stated goal to &quot;restore fantasy to its proper place in the literary pantheon&quot;. A steering group of 18 authors was chaired by writer Stan Nicholls and the award was decided by a public vote.

==Early life==

David Gemmell was born in 1948 in west London. Raised alone by his mother until the age of 6, he experienced a harsh upbringing in a tough urban area, suffering bullying and taunts from his peers, partly due to the absence of his father, and often sustained serious injuries through fighting. Preferring reading books to fighting, he was compelled to take up boxing by his stepfather, who insisted he learn how to stand up for himself without &quot;hiding behind walls or running away&quot;; this philosophy informed much of Gemmell&#x27;s later writing. As a child, he said he &quot;would have given anything&quot; to stand beside King Harold II at the Battle of Hastings. As a teenager, he wanted to stand with Marshal Will Kane in the film &quot;High Noon&quot;.

Gemmell was expelled from school at the age of 16, for organizing a gambling syndicate, and as a youth was arrested several times. He claimed that one psychologist&#x27;s report at the time labelled him a psychopath.

Gemmell went on to work as a labourer, a lorry-driver&#x27;s mate, and a nightclub bouncer before his mother set up a job interview with a local newspaper. Of 100 applicants, he was probably the least qualified for the position but was hired owing to his display of arrogance during the interview, which was mistaken for self-confidence. He went on to work as a journalist for several local newspapers in East Sussex, for five of which he eventually became editor-in-chief. He also worked freelance as a stringer for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Daily Express&quot; national newspapers.

Coming from a staunch socialist family, Gemmell carried banners and campaigned for eventual Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in the 1960s, although he nevertheless admitted a grudging alignment with Thatcherite policies on issues of foreign policy, especially the Falklands Conflict, and with Reaganite views on East-West relations.

==Writing career==
Gemmell first attempted writing a novel in the 1970s, but &quot;The Man from Miami&quot; failed to find a publisher. He later admitted that the book &quot;was so bad it could curdle milk at 50 paces.&quot; In 1976, after being diagnosed with a cancer he believed to be terminal, he wrote &quot;The Siege of Dros Delnoch&quot; in order to take his mind off his illness and to realise his ambition of having a novel published before he died. Written in two weeks, the novel told of a siege resisted against overwhelming odds, at the time serving as a metaphor for his illness; the fortress at the center of the tale was Gemmell, the invaders were his cancer. Leaving the ending of the novel open, he planned to let the fortress stand or fall dependent upon his own prognosis. When Gemmell later learned that he had suffered a misdiagnosis, he set &quot;The Siege of Dros Delnoch&quot; to one side until 1980, when a friend read the manuscript and convinced Gemmell to sharpen up the novel in order to make one last attempt at publication. It was accepted in 1982 and published in 1984 under the new title, &quot;Legend&quot;, going on to achieve considerable commercial success. Gemmell said that while it had &quot;all the flaws you expect in a first novel&quot;, the writing of &quot;Legend&quot; was &quot;a golden time&quot; in his life, citing it as the favourite of all his novels. He said that while he could &quot;write it better&quot; after becoming an established author, &quot;[its heart] wouldn&#x27;t be bettered by improving its style.&quot; Gemmell&#x27;s journalism career overlapped with his career writing novels until the publication of his third novel &quot;Waylander&quot; in 1986, when he was fired after using colleagues&#x27; names for characters in the book. Gemmell later said that his Managing Director had regarded it &quot;a poisonous attack on his integrity.&quot;

After the publication of &quot;Waylander&quot;, Gemmell became an author full-time, writing over thirty novels in total, some as part of long-running series, others as standalone works. Most of his novels were in the heroic fantasy genre; &quot;White Knight, Black Swan&quot; was a crime thriller, appearing under the pseudonym Ross Harding, and was Gemmell&#x27;s only novel not to become a bestseller. Two of Gemmell&#x27;s novels have also been adapted into graphic novel format. Gemmell&#x27;s books have sold more than one million copies.

Gemmell married twice; his first marriage to Valerie produced two children before he met his second wife, Stella who had already been acknowledged in many of his books. The couple made their home in Hastings on the south-east coast of England until the author&#x27;s death.

==Death, posthumous publication and legacy==
In mid-2006, Gemmell was on a trip to Alaska when he became discomforted. He immediately travelled back to the UK, where he underwent quadruple heart bypass surgery in a private London hospital. Within two days he was able to take physical exercise and returned home to resume work on his latest novel. On the morning of 28 July 2006, four days before his 58th birthday, Gemmell was discovered by his wife, slumped over his computer, having died of coronary artery disease.

At the time of his death, Gemmell had completed 70,000 words of the final novel in his Troy series, an alternative-history trilogy based upon the legend of the siege of Troy. Only hours after his death, Gemmell&#x27;s wife Stella resolved to complete the second half of the novel based upon his chapter plan and notes, and she contacted Gemmell&#x27;s publisher two weeks after his funeral in order to make the offer. As a former junior reporter, aspiring novelist, and subeditor, and having been involved in Gemmell&#x27;s writing process for a number of years, Stella Gemmell felt she was &quot;the only one who could do it.&quot; Preparing for the task, she reread her husband&#x27;s previous work, deconstructing the battle scenes in order to build her own. &quot;Troy: Fall of Kings&quot; was published in 2007 under the joint authorship of David and Stella Gemmell.

Up until his death, Gemmell was also patron of the Hastings Writers&#x27; Group, following founder member Catherine Cookson. As patron, he was the main judge in the national literary competition run by the group, the Legend Writing Award, which was named after his breakthrough novel. In 2008, the David Gemmell Legend Award was established, intended to &quot;restore fantasy to its proper place in the literary pantheon&quot;; a steering group of 18 authors is chaired by writer Stan Nicholls, and the award is decided by a public vote. At the inaugural ceremony in June 2009, the first recipient was the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, for his novel &quot;Blood of Elves&quot;. The youngest author to be nominated for this award was 17-year-old Liam Gillen.

Military historian Ross Cowan dedicated &quot;For the Glory of Rome: A History of Warriors and Warfare&quot; (2007) to Gemmell: &quot;This book is dedicated to the memory of David Gemmell. He wrote about warriors and heroes, many of them ancient Greeks and Romans. His novel Ghost King introduced me to the legend of the Ninth Legion and ignited my interest in the Roman army.&quot;

==Influences and themes==
Originally intending to be a historical novelist, Gemmell was intrigued by events which ended badly for the protagonists. Citing the Battle of the Alamo and the grisly fate of William Wallace as influences, he said that had he written about the 13th century Scottish revolutionary, he would have found a way in which Wallace was ultimately victorious despite the odds, then eventually realised this kind of storytelling would be more palatable in a fantasy setting.

Gemmell&#x27;s work typically deals with themes of honour and loyalty, advancing age, lost causes and the possibility of redemption for even the most corrupt (he was interested in the &quot;true nature&quot; of heroes, considering most to be unreliably so). The consistent presence of redemption in Gemmell&#x27;s work reflects his Christian beliefs. He claimed that all of his novels have a religious basis, calling them &quot;essentially Christian books&quot; and saying that Christianity stopped him from &quot;promoting the cause of evil&quot; by writing &quot;mindless savagery&quot; in the vein of George G. Gilman&#x27;s &quot;Edge&quot; westerns. Often didactic, his work typically features a charismatic warrior tortured by loss and self-doubt, who bands together with a group of unlikely companions in order to defeat a dark enemy, usually aided by mystical forces. While all his novels are violent, successes are often Pyrrhic and the villains complex.

Gemmell credited his time as a journalist with providing him with his pacey, succinct style, although critics labelled his work &quot;macho&quot; and would often cite his limited vocabulary and the repetitive nature of his stories. Violent events usually provide the sole impetus for plot development, and are resolved by physical violence or heroics.

Gemmell, known for his strong characterisation, attributed this to his tendency to draw from real life; having been acquainted with violent men, he understood and enjoyed writing them. Gemmell based the hero from his novel &quot;Legend&quot; on his stepfather Bill Woodford, calling men like him &quot;…the havens, the safe harbours of childhood. They are the watch hounds who keep the wolves at bay.&quot; Bill reappeared in many of Gemmell&#x27;s subsequent novels, in many different forms. When Bill died during the writing of &quot;Ravenheart&quot;, as a tribute Gemmell reworked the novel to give the &quot;Bill&quot; character centre stage. Gemmell has also been cited as saying that a major influence was classic western movies, which is evidenced at the end of &quot;Stormrider&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Ravenheart&quot;, when some of his characters enter a mystical world akin to the Native American (First Nation) spirit world. References to John Wayne movies are also found throughout the first two books in the &quot;Rigante&quot; series, &quot;Sword in the Storm&quot; and even more-so in &quot;Midnight Falcon&quot;, where his main character Bane, is a gladiator.

<doc id="83238" wikidata="Q8420" url="?curid=83238" title="1964 Summer Olympics">
<text>The , officially the and commonly known as Tokyo 1964 (), were an international multi-sport event held from 10 to 24 October 1964 in Tokyo, Japan. Tokyo had been awarded the organization of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but this honor was subsequently passed to Helsinki due to Japan&#x27;s invasion of China, before ultimately being cancelled due to World War II. Tokyo was chosen as the host city during the 55th IOC Session in West Germany on 26 May 1959.

The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia, and marked the first time South Africa was excluded for using its apartheid system in sports. Until 1960, South Africa had fielded segregated teams, conforming to the country&#x27;s racial classifications; for the 1964 Games the International Olympic Committee demanded a multi-racial delegation to be sent, and after South Africa refused, they were excluded from participating. The country was, however, allowed to compete at the 1964 Summer Paralympics, also held in Tokyo, its Paralympic Games debut.

The 1964 Games were also the first to be telecast internationally without the need for tapes to be flown overseas, as they had been for the 1960 Olympics four years earlier. The games were telecast to the United States using Syncom 3, the first geostationary communication satellite, and from there to Europe using Relay 1. These were also the first Olympic Games to have color telecasts, albeit partially. Certain events such as the sumo wrestling and judo matches, sports popular in Japan, were tried out using Toshiba&#x27;s new colour transmission system, but only for the domestic market. The entire 1964 Olympic Games was chronicled in the ground-breaking 1965 sports documentary film &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot;, directed by Kon Ichikawa.

The games were scheduled for mid-October to avoid the city&#x27;s midsummer heat and humidity and the September typhoon season. The previous Olympics in Rome in 1960 started in late August and experienced hot weather. The following games in 1968 in Mexico City also began in October. The 1964 Olympics were also the last to use a traditional cinder track for the track events. Since 1968, a smooth, synthetic, all-weather track has been used. The United States topped the gold medal table at these Games, while the Soviet Union won the most medals overall.

In 2021, due to delay over the COVID-19 pandemic, Tokyo hosted the 2020 Summer Olympics, making it the first city in Asia to host the Summer Olympic Games twice. Japan also hosted the Winter Olympics twice with the Sapporo 1972 and Nagano 1998 games.

==Host city selection==

Tokyo won the rights to the Games on 26 May 1959 at the 55th IOC Session in Munich, West Germany, over bids from Detroit, Brussels and Vienna.

Toronto was an early bidder again in 1964 after the failed attempt for 1960 and failed to make the final round.

==Highlights==


* Yūji Koseki composed the theme song of the opening ceremony.
* Yoshinori Sakai, who lit the Olympic flame, was born in Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, the day an atomic bomb was dropped on that city. He was chosen for the role to symbolize Japan&#x27;s postwar reconstruction and peace.
* Kumi-daiko was first exhibited to a worldwide audience at the Festival of Arts presentation.
* Judo and volleyball, both popular sports in Japan, were introduced to the Olympics. Japan won gold medals in three judo events, but Dutchman Anton Geesink won the Open category. The Japanese women&#x27;s volleyball team won the gold medal, with the final being broadcast live.
* The women&#x27;s pentathlon (shot put, high jump, hurdling, sprint and long jump) was introduced to the athletics events.
* Reigning world champion Osamu Watanabe capped off his career with a gold medal for Japan in freestyle wrestling, surrendering no points and retiring from competition as the only undefeated Olympic champion to date at 189–0.
* Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina won two gold medals, a silver medal and two bronze medals. She had held the record for most Olympic medals at 18 (nine gold, five silver, four bronze) which stood until broken by American swimmer Michael Phelps in 2012.
* Czechoslovakian gymnast Věra Čáslavská won three gold medals, including the individual all-around competition, crowning her the new queen over the reigning champion Larisa Latynina.
* Australian swimmer Dawn Fraser won the 100 m freestyle event for the third time in a row, a feat matched by Soviet Vyacheslav Ivanov in rowing&#x27;s single scull event.
* Don Schollander won four gold medals in swimming.
* Abebe Bikila (Ethiopia) became the first person to win the Olympic marathon twice.
* 15-year-old Sharon Stouder won four medals in women&#x27;s swimming, three of them gold.
* New Zealand&#x27;s Peter Snell became the third person (after British Albert Hill in 1920 and Australian Edwin Flack in 1896) to win gold medals in both the 800 m and 1500 m in the same Olympics.
* Billy Mills, an unfancied runner, became the only American, as well as the first Native American, to win the gold in the men&#x27;s 10,000 m.
* Bob Hayes won the 100 metre title in a time of 10.06 seconds, equaling the world record, and set the current record for the fastest relay leg in the 4×100 m.
* Joe Frazier, future heavyweight champion of the world, won a gold medal in heavyweight boxing while competing with a broken thumb.
* This was the last Summer Olympics to use a cinder running track for athletic events, and the first to use fiberglass poles for pole vaulting.
* Zambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the 1964 Summer Olympics, thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic games as one country, and left it as another. This was celebrated in the ceremony itself by the team using a placard with &quot;Zambia&quot; instead of the &quot;Northern Rhodesia&quot; placard from the opening ceremony. Zambia was the only team to use a placard in the closing ceremony.
* The start of operations for the first Japanese &quot;bullet train&quot; (the Tōkaidō Shinkansen) between Tokyo Station and Shin-Ōsaka Station was scheduled to coincide with the Olympic games. The first regularly scheduled train ran on 1 October 1964, just nine days before the opening of the games, transporting passengers in about four hours, and connecting the three major metropolitan areas of Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka.
* Ranatunge Karunananda who represented Ceylon in men&#x27;s 10,000 meters, continued to run alone even after the others had finished the race. Spectators first started to jeer at him. But when he came around a second time, there was silence. Finally he finished the race amid cheers and applause. Karunananda&#x27;s Olympic story has been entered into Japanese school textbooks titled &#x27;Uniform Number 67&#x27;, &#x27;Bottom Ranked Hero&#x27;.

Ninety-four nations participated in the 1964 Games. Sixteen nations made their first Olympic appearance in Tokyo: Algeria, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (as &quot;Ivory Coast&quot;), Dominican Republic, Libya (but it withdrew before the competition), Madagascar, Malaysia, Mali, Mongolia, Nepal, Niger, Northern Rhodesia, Senegal, and Tanzania (as &quot;Tanganyika&quot;).

Northern Rhodesia achieved full independence as Zambia on the same day as the closing ceremony. Athletes from Southern Rhodesia competed under the banner of Rhodesia; this was the last of three appearances at the Summer Olympics by a Rhodesian representation. Zimbabwe would later make its first appearance at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

Athletes from East Germany and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany, as they had done previously in 1956 and 1960. The nations would enter separate teams beginning with the 1968 Winter Olympics.

Indonesia was banned from the 1964 Olympics, due to its refusal to allow Israeli and Taiwanese athletes visas at the 1962 Asian Games. Indonesia was originally banned on the meeting which took place in Lausanne on 7 February 1963. The decision was changed on 26 June 1964 citing the changed position of the Government of Indonesia towards the Tokyo games.


* also took part in the Opening Ceremony, but its lone athlete (a marathon runner) withdrew from competition.

==Transportation and communications==
These games were the first to be telecast internationally. The games were telecast to the United States using Syncom 3, the first geostationary communication satellite, and from there to Europe using Relay 1, an older satellite which allowed only 15–20 minutes of broadcast during each of its orbits. Total broadcast time of programs delivered via satellite was 5 hours 41 minutes in the United States, 12 hours 27 minutes in Europe, and 14 hours 18 minutes in Canada. Pictures were received via satellite in the United States, Canada, and 21 countries in Europe. Several broadcasters recorded some sports from Japan and flown over to their countries. While the agreement to use satellite to transmit the games live to the United States was a proud achievement for the American government and Hughes Corporation which developed the satellites, NBC the rights holder had little interest in the project. NBC&#x27;s participation was due to pressure from the Under-Secretary of State for Political Affairs Averell Harriman, and NBC intended to record the live transmissions for later use in sponsored shows. NBC broadcast the opening ceremonies live on the East coast of the United States, but delayed the broadcast on the West coast to 1:00 a.m. so Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; would not be interrupted. When pressed on the issue NBC announced there would be no more live telecasts which angered the American State Department which saw the broadcasts as a matter of national prestige, and also the Hughes Aircraft Company who won the bid to build the satellite system over RCA which owned NBC.

TRANSPAC-1, the first trans-Pacific communications cable from Japan to Hawaii was also finished in June 1964 in time for these games. Before this, most communications from Japan to other countries were via shortwave.

The start of operations for the first Japanese bullet train (the Tokaido Shinkansen) between Tokyo Station and Shin-Ōsaka Station was scheduled to coincide with the Olympic games. The first regularly scheduled train ran on 1 October 1964, just nine days before the opening of the games, transporting passengers in about four hours, and connecting the three major metropolitan areas of Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka.

Some already-planned upgrades to both highways and commuter rail lines were rescheduled for completion in time for these games. Of the eight main expressways approved by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in 1959, No. 1, No. 4 and a portion of No. 2 and No. 3 were completed for the games. Two subway lines totaling were also completed in time for the games, and the port of Tokyo facilities were expanded to handle the anticipated traffic.

==Visual identity==

As a visual aid for foreign visitors to the Games, this Olympics was the first to use pictograms, created by Masasa Katzumie, to represent each event visually. This became a standard visual component of the modern Olympics ever since. The mythical kappa, which featured on a pin issued with the Olympic logo, is considered an unofficial mascot of the Games. Pins with a kappa were made annually beginning in 1956 for the Tokyo Sport festival, with the 1964 edition specifically commemorating the Olympics.

==Cost==
&quot;The Oxford Olympics Study&quot; established the outturn cost of the Tokyo 1964 Summer Olympics at 282 million in 2015-dollars. This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) &quot;operational costs&quot; incurred by the organizing committee for the purpose of staging the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) &quot;direct capital costs&quot; incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are &quot;not&quot; included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost for Tokyo 1964 compares with costs of US$4.6 billion for Rio 2016, US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history. Average cost for Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.

== Legacy ==
The 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo celebrated Japan&#x27;s progress and reemergence on the world stage. The new Japan was no longer a wartime enemy, but a peaceful country that threatened no one, and this transformation was accomplished in fewer than 20 years.

To host such a major event, Tokyo&#x27;s infrastructure needed to be modernized in time for large numbers of expected tourists. Enormous energy and expense was devoted to upgrading the city&#x27;s physical infrastructure, including new buildings, highways, stadiums, hotels, airports and trains. There was a new satellite to facilitate live international broadcast. Multiple train and subway lines, a large highway building project, and the Tokaido Shinkansen, the fastest train in the world, were completed. Tokyo International Airport and the Port of Tokyo were modernized. International satellite broadcasting was initiated, and Japan was now connected to the world with a new undersea communications cable. The YS-11, a commercial turboprop plane developed in Japan, was used to transport the Olympic Flame within Japan. For swimming, a new timing system started the clock by the sound of the starter gun and stopped it with touchpads. The photo finish using a photograph with lines on it was introduced to determine the results of sprints. All of this demonstrated that Japan was now part of the first world and a technological leader, and at the same time demonstrated how other countries might modernize. In preparation for the games, 200,000 stray cats and dogs were rounded up and killed.

However, the construction projects resulted in environmental damage, forced relocations for residents, and loss of industry. In addition, corruption by politicians and construction companies resulted in cost overruns and shoddy work.

Although public opinion about the Olympics in Japan had initially been split, by the time the games started almost everyone was behind them. The broadcast of the opening ceremony was watched by over 70% of the viewing public, and the women&#x27;s volleyball team&#x27;s gold medal match was watched by over 80%.

As with many other Olympics, observers later stated that 1964 Olympic preparation and construction projects had had a negative effect on the environment and lower income people.

The Cary Grant film &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot; was filmed during the Tokyo Olympics, and set in Tokyo during the Olympics. A message at the beginning of the film thanks the Japanese Government and Tokyo Police for putting up with them filming in crowded Tokyo.

The Studio Ghibli film &quot;From Up on Poppy Hill&quot; takes place one year before the Tokyo Olympics and refers to the upcoming games. The official poster can be seen several times in the film.

Tokyo attempted to bring the Olympic Games back to the city, having unsuccessfully bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which were awarded to Rio de Janeiro. Tokyo was chosen to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics games, making it the first Asian city to host the games twice. The worldwide coronavirus pandemic, however, forced the organizers to postpone the games to summer 2021, the first time that an Olympic Games was cancelled or rescheduled during peacetime.

The Japan Society Fall 2019 exhibition, &quot;Made in Tokyo: Architecture and Living, 1964/2020&quot;, is an architectural exhibition that examines the social, cultural, economic, and political impacts of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics on the modernization of the Tokyo landscape (Homes, Offices, Retail Businesses, Athletic Stadiums, Hotels, and Transportation Stations). The exhibition was curated by the Japanese architectural firm Atelier Bow-Wow.

The majority of Japanese castles were smashed and destroyed in the late 19th century in the Meiji restoration by the Japanese people and government in order to modernize and westernize Japan and break from their past feudal era of the Daimyo and Shoguns. It was only due to the 1964 Olympics in Japan that cheap concrete replicas of those castles were built in preparation for tourists. The vast majority of castles in Japan today are new replicas made out of concrete. In 1959 a concrete keep was built for Nagoya castle.

== Boycotting countries ==
North Korea withdrew its athletes from the 1964 Summer Olympics just before the Games were due to start, as the IOC were refusing to accept any athletes who had participated in the Games of the New Emerging Forces (GANEFO) held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1963. China and Indonesia also chose not to attend the Tokyo Games due to GANEFO issues.

<doc id="83239" wikidata="Q155644" url="?curid=83239" title="Uzi">
<text>The Uzi (; ; officially cased as UZI) is a family of Israeli open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine guns and machine pistols first designed by Major Uziel &quot;Uzi&quot; Gal in the late 1940s, shortly after the establishment of the State of Israel. It is one of the first weapons to incorporate a telescoping bolt design, which allows the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon.

The Uzi prototype was finished in 1950. It was first introduced to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) special forces in 1954, and the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The IDF supplied Uzis to rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tank crews, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces.

The Uzi has been exported to over 90 countries. Over its service lifetime, it has been manufactured by Israel Military Industries, FN Herstal, and other manufacturers. From the 1960s through to the 1980s, more Uzi submachine guns were sold to more military, law enforcement and security markets than any other submachine gun ever made.

== Design ==
The Uzi uses an open-bolt, blowback-operated design, quite similar to the Jaroslav Holeček-designed Czech ZK 476 (prototype only) and the production Sa 23, Sa 24, Sa 25, and Sa 26 series of submachine guns. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. However, it means that since the bolt is held to the rear when cocked, the receiver is more susceptible to contamination from sand and dirt. It uses a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip, allowing for a heavier, slower-firing bolt in a shorter, better-balanced weapon.

The weapon is constructed primarily from stamped sheet metal, making it less expensive per unit to manufacture than an equivalent design machined from forgings. With relatively few moving parts, the Uzi is easy to strip for maintenance or repair. The magazine is housed within the pistol grip, allowing for intuitive and easy reloading in dark or difficult conditions, under the principle of &quot;hand finds hand&quot;. The pistol grip is fitted with a grip safety, making it difficult to fire accidentally. However, the protruding vertical magazine makes the gun awkward to fire when prone. The Uzi features a bayonet lug.
===Operation===
The non-reciprocating charging handle on the top of the receiver cover is used to retract the bolt. Variants have a ratchet safety mechanism which will catch the bolt and lock its movement if it is retracted past the magazine, but not far enough to engage the sear. When the handle is fully retracted to the rear, the bolt will cock (catch) on the sear mechanism and the handle and cover are released to spring fully forward under power of a small spring. The cover will remain forward during firing since it does not reciprocate with the bolt. The military and police versions will fire immediately upon chambering a cartridge as the Uzi is an open bolt weapon.

There are two external safety mechanisms on the Uzi. The first is the three-position selector lever located at the top of the grip and behind the trigger group. The rear position is &quot;S&quot;, or &quot;safe&quot; (S = Sicher or Secure on the MP2), which locks the sear and prevents movement of the bolt.

The second external safety mechanism is the grip safety, which is located at the rear of the grip. It is meant to help prevent accidental discharge if the weapon is dropped or the user loses a firm grip on the weapon during firing.

The trigger mechanism is a conventional firearm trigger, but functions only to control the release mechanism for either the bolt (submachine gun) or firing pin holding mechanism (semi-auto) since the Uzi does not incorporate an internal cocking or hammer mechanism. While the open-bolt system is mechanically simpler than a closed-bolt design (e.g. Heckler &amp; Koch MP5), it creates a noticeable delay between when the trigger is pulled and when the gun fires.

The magazine release button or lever is located on the lower portion of the pistol grip and is intended to be manipulated by the non-firing hand. The paddle-like button lies flush with the pistol grip in order to help prevent accidental release of the magazine during rigorous or careless handling.

When the gun is de-cocked the ejector port closes, preventing entry of dust and dirt. Though the Uzi&#x27;s stamped-metal receiver is equipped with pressed reinforcement slots to accept accumulated dirt and sand, the weapon can still jam with heavy accumulations of sand in desert combat conditions when not cleaned regularly. The magazine must be removed prior to de-cocking the weapon.

=== Stocks ===

There are different stocks available for the Uzi proper. There is a wooden stock with a metal buttplate that comes in three similar variations that were used by the IDF. The first version had a flat butt and straight comb and had hollows for a cleaning rod and gun oil bottle. The second had an angled butt and a straight comb and no hollows. The third had an angled butt and curved comb and no hollows; a polymer version is currently available from IMI. The wooden stocks originally had a quick-release base but the ones sold in the United States often had a permanent base for legal reasons, as detachable stocks on pistols or other short-barreled weapons upgrade the weapon to NFA status.

Choate made an aftermarket polymer stock with a rubber butt-pad that had a flat butt, a straight comb, and a permanent base.

In 1956, IMI developed a downward-folding twin-strut metal stock with two swivelling sections that tuck under the rear of the receiver. The Mini Uzi has a forward-folding single-strut metal stock that is actually an inch longer than the Uzi&#x27;s. Its buttplate can be used as a foregrip when stowed. The Micro Uzi has a similar model.

=== Magazines ===
The original box magazines for the 9mm Uzi had a 25-round capacity. Experimental 40- and 50-round extended magazines were tried but were found to be unreliable. A 32-round extended magazine was then tried and was later accepted as standard. The Mini Uzi and Micro Uzi use a shorter 20-round magazine. Available extended magazines include 40-, and 50-round magazines. Other high-capacity aftermarket magazines exist such as the Vector Arms 70-round and Beta Company (Beta C-Mag) 100-round drums.

The .45 ACP Uzi used a 16- or 22-round magazine, while the .45 ACP Micro Uzi and Mini Uzi used a 12-round magazine. A conversion kit by Vector Arms allowed the .45-caliber Uzi to use the same 30-round magazines as the M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot;.

=== Caliber conversions ===
The Uzi was available with caliber conversion kits in .22 LR or .41 AE. The operator just has to change the barrel, bolt and magazine. The .22 LR had 20-round magazines; the original IMI kit used a barrel insert while the aftermarket Action Arms kit used a full replacement barrel. The .41 AE also had a 20-round magazine; since it has the same bolt face as the 9×19mm Parabellum, only the barrel and magazine needed to be changed.

IMI also manufactured a .45ACP conversion kit both in full auto/open bolt with a 10.2&quot; barrel for the 9mm SMG and a semi only/closed bolt with a 16&quot; barrel for the carbine version. Magazine capacity is limited, with 2 sizes of 16 and 10 rds each.

== History and operational use ==
The Uzi submachine gun was designed by Captain (later Major) Uziel Gal of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The weapon was submitted to the Israeli Army for evaluation and won out over more conventional designs due to its simplicity and economy of manufacture. Gal did not want the weapon to be named after him, but his request was ignored. The Uzi was officially adopted in 1951. First introduced to IDF special forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The first Uzis were equipped with a short, fixed wooden buttstock, and this is the version that initially saw combat during the 1956 Suez Campaign. Later models would be equipped with a folding metal stock.

The Uzi was used as a personal defense weapon by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces. The Uzi&#x27;s compact size and firepower proved instrumental in clearing Syrian bunkers and Jordanian defensive positions during the 1967 Six-Day War. Though the weapon was phased out of frontline IDF service in the 1980s, some Uzis and Uzi variants were still used by a few IDF units until December 2003, when the IDF announced that it was retiring the Uzi from all IDF forces. It was subsequently replaced by the fully automatic Micro Tavor.

In general, the Uzi was a reliable weapon in military service. However, even the Uzi fell victim to extreme conditions of sand and dust. During the Sinai Campaign of the Yom Kippur War, IDF Army units reaching the Suez Canal reported that of all their small arms, only the 7.62mm FN MAG machine gun was still in operation.

The Uzi proved especially useful for mechanized infantry needing a compact weapon and for infantry units clearing bunkers and other confined spaces. However, its limited range and accuracy in automatic fire (approximately ) could be disconcerting when encountering enemy forces armed with longer-range small arms, and heavier support weapons could not always substitute for a longer-ranged individual weapon. These failings eventually caused the phasing out of the Uzi from IDF front-line assault units.

The Uzi has been used in various conflicts outside Israel and the Middle East during the 1960s and 1970s. Quantities of 9 mm Uzi submachine guns were used by Portuguese cavalry, police, and security forces during the Portuguese Colonial Wars in Africa.

== Worldwide sales ==

Total sales of the weapon to date (end of 2001) has netted IMI over 2 billion US dollars, with over 90 countries using the weapons either for their armed forces or in law enforcement.
* The Royal Netherlands Army first issued the Uzi in 1956. It was the first country other than Israel to use it as a service weapon. Their models are distinct in that they have a wooden stock (made to their specifications) that is more angular, an angled butt and a curved comb, and is 2 inches longer than the IDF model. The wooden stock versions were mainly used by the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Marine Corps. The Army and Airforce received the metal foldable stock versions as replacement. No bayonets were issued.
* The German Bundeswehr (especially its tank crews) used the Uzi since 1959 under the designation MP2. It replaced the MP1 (Beretta M1938/49) and Thompson M1 in service. The MP2 was fitted with the IDF-style wooden stock and the later MP2A1 was fitted with the metal folding stock. It can be recognized by its distinctive three-position &quot;DES&quot; selector switch: &quot;D&quot; for &quot;Dauerfeuer&quot; (&quot;continuous-fire&quot;, or &quot;automatic&quot;), &quot;E&quot; for &quot;Einzelfeuer&quot; (&quot;single-fire&quot;, or &quot;semi-automatic&quot;), and &quot;S&quot; for &quot;Sicher&quot; (&quot;secure&quot;, or &quot;safe&quot;). It was replaced with the Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 Personal Defense Weapon in 2007.
* The Belgian Armed Forces have used Uzi machine pistols in 9mm, .45 ACP and 22LR calibres, license-made by FN Herstal from 1958 to 1971. They were also issued to the paramilitary Gendarmerie.
* The Irish Gardaí ERU and RSU were issued the Uzi from the 1970s to 2012. It was replaced with the Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 in March 2014.
* In Rhodesia, the Uzi was produced under license from 1976 until the fall of Rhodesia in 1980. It was made from Israeli-supplied (and later Rhodesian-made) components.
* Sri Lanka ordered a few thousand Mini Uzi and Uzi carbines in 1990s. Currently those are deployed with the Sri Lanka Army, Sri Lanka Navy Elite Forces, and the Sri Lanka Police Special Task Force as their primary weapon when providing security for VIPs.
* The United States Secret Service used the Uzi as their standard submachine gun from the 1960s until the early 1990s, when it was phased out and replaced with the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 and FN P90. When President Ronald Reagan was shot on March 30, 1981, Secret Service Special Agent Robert Wanko pulled an Uzi out of a briefcase and covered the rear of the presidential limousine as it sped to safety with the wounded president inside.
* All merchant mariners of the Zim Integrated Shipping line are trained in the use of, and issued, the Uzi.

== Military variants ==
The standard Uzi has a barrel. It has a rate of automatic fire of 600 rounds per minute (rpm) when chambered in 9mm Parabellum; the .45 ACP model&#x27;s rate of fire is slower at 500 rpm.

The Mini Uzi is a smaller version of the regular Uzi, first introduced in 1980. The Mini Uzi is long or long with the stock folded. Its barrel length is , its muzzle velocity is and its effective range is . It has a greater automatic rate of fire of 950 rounds per minute due to the shorter bolt. Its weight is approximately .

The Micro Uzi is an even further scaled down version of the Uzi, introduced in 1986. The Micro Uzi is long, reduced to with the stock folded, and its barrel length is . It has a closed bolt compared to its original counterpart. Its muzzle velocity is and its cyclic rate of fire is 1,200 rpm. It weighs slightly over .

The Uzi Pro, an improved variant of the Micro Uzi, was launched in 2010 by Israel Weapon Industries Ltd. (I.W.I.), formerly the &quot;magen&quot; (&quot;small arms&quot;) division of Israel Military Industries. The Uzi Pro is a blowback-operated, select-fire, closed-bolt submachine gun with a large lower portion, comprising grip and handguard, entirely made of polymer to reduce weight; the grip section was redesigned to allow two-handed operation and facilitate control in full-automatic fire of such a small-sized firearm. The Uzi Pro features four Picatinny rails, two at the sides of the barrel, which can be removed, one below the barrel for the addition of foregrips and one on the top for optics. The under barrel rail is often shown with a specialised foregrip which attaches to the pistol grip to form a hand guard. In addition, the cocking handle has been moved to the left side. The new weapon weighs and has a length of with an extended stock, and while collapsed. As of 2011 it has been purchased by the IDF in limited numbers for evaluation and it is yet to be decided whether or not to order additional units for all of its special forces.

== Civilian variants ==
===Uzi carbine===
The Uzi carbine is similar in appearance to the Uzi submachine gun. The Uzi carbine is fitted with a barrel, to meet the minimum rifle barrel length requirement for civilian sales in the United States. A small number of Uzi carbines were produced with the standard length barrel for special markets. It fires from a closed-bolt position in semi-automatic mode only and uses a floating firing pin as opposed to a fixed firing pin. The FS-style selector switch has two positions (the automatic setting was blocked): &quot;F&quot; for &quot;fire&quot; (semi-auto) and &quot;S&quot; for &quot;safe&quot;. Uzi carbines are available in .22 LR, 9mm, .41 AE, and .45 ACP calibers.

The Uzi carbine has two main variants, the Model A (imported from 1980 to 1983) and the Model B (imported from 1983 until 1989). The Type A was the same as the fully automatic Uzi, while the Type B had a firing pin safety and improved sights and sling swivels. These two variants were imported and distributed by Action Arms.

The American firm Group Industries made limited numbers of a copy of the Uzi &quot;B&quot; model semiauto carbine for sale in the US along with copies of the Uzi submachine gun for the U.S. collectors&#x27; market. After registering several hundred submachine guns transferable to the general public through a special government-regulated process, production was halted due to financial troubles at the company. Company assets (including partially made Uzi submachine guns, parts, and tooling) were purchased by an investment group later to become known as Vektor Arms. Vektor Arms built and marketed numerous versions of the Uzi carbine and the Mini Uzi. As of 2024, average prices can be over $25,000.00 USD.

Today, while the civilian manufacture, sale and possession of post-1986 select-fire Uzi and its variants is prohibited in the United States, it is still legal to sell templates, tooling and manuals to complete such conversion. These items are typically marketed as being &quot;post-sample&quot; materials for use by federal firearm licensees for manufacturing/distributing select-fire variants of the Uzi to law enforcement, military and overseas customers.

===Mini Uzi carbine===
The Mini Uzi carbine is similar in appearance to the Mini Uzi machine pistol. The Mini Uzi carbine is fitted with a barrel, to meet the minimum rifle overall length requirement for civilian sales in the United States. It fires from a closed-bolt position in semi-automatic mode only.

===Uzi pistol===

The Uzi pistol is a semi-automatic, closed bolt, and blowback-operated pistol variant. Its muzzle velocity is 345 m/s. It is a Micro Uzi with no shoulder stock or full-automatic firing capability. The intended users of the pistol are various security agencies in need of a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, or civilian shooters who want a gun with those qualities and the familiarity of the Uzi style. It was introduced in 1984 and produced until 1993.

===Uzi Pro pistol===
The Uzi Pro pistol is a current version of the Uzi pistol. It has rails on the top and bottom, and there is an optional stabilizing brace. Unlike any other Uzi variant, the Uzi Pro pistol has a side charging handle, rather than a top charging handle, and has a three-stage safety. There are three safeties on the Uzi Pro pistol: a thumb safety, a grip safety, and a firing pin block. This model was intended for law enforcement and civilian use, due to the compact size, rails, and a semi-automatic rate of fire. Unlike other Uzi variants, the Uzi Pro pistol is only chambered for 9×19 Parabellum.

===AG Strojnica ERO===

The &quot;Arma Grupa&quot; Strojnica ERO (Arms Group &quot;ERO machine-gun&quot;) was a Croatian Uzi clone made locally by &quot;Arma Grupa&quot; of Zagreb during the Yugoslav War. It was made entirely from steel stampings, causing it to weigh more (). The only difference from the Uzi is the selector switch, which is marked &quot;R&quot; (&quot;Rafalno&quot; {&quot;burst&quot;}, for full automatic fire), &quot;P&quot; (&quot;Pojedinačno&quot;, for single shot) and &quot;Z&quot; (&quot;Zaključan&quot; {locked}, for safe) and its rate of fire is 650 rounds per minute. It uses the 32-round magazine as standard, but can use any 9mm Uzi-interface magazine of 25 rounds or larger.

The Strojnica Mini ERO is a clone of the Micro Uzi; it differs in that it had a heavy-gauge folding wire stock like the Skorpion Machine Pistol. It weighs unloaded and is overall with the folding stock extended and with the stock folded. It uses the 20-round Mini Uzi magazine.

The EROs were used by the Croatians as early as 1992.

===BA93 and BA94===
The BA93 and BA94 are Myanmar made clones of the Uzi. Production started in Myanmar after 1991 when an Israeli delegation visited the country and supplied the &quot;Tatmadaw&quot; with Uzis. It also included the rights to manufacture the Uzi under license.

The BA93 is based on the Uzi, but with a longer barrel and fixed stock. It was introduced in 1993. It is commonly seen with Myanmar soldiers and special forces units operating in commando or VIP protection operations.

The BA94 was introduced in 1994. Improvements made include moving the charging handle from the top to the left with a shorter barrel. This model is mostly seen with Myanma police forces.

As of 2018, both weapons were renamed MA-13.

===Socimi Type 821===
===Norinco M320===
Norinco of China manufactures an unlicensed copy of the Uzi Model B that is sold as the M320. Early versions were marked &quot;POLICE Model&quot; in English. Modifications were made to avoid the US Assault Weapon Import Ban: the folding stock was replaced with a wooden thumbhole stock, the barrel nut was welded in place, and the bayonet lug was removed. The gun had a gray parkerized finish, a carbine-length barrel and is overall.

===TK-K12===
The TK-K12 (or TL-K12) is a Vietnamese clone of the IMI Micro Uzi since 2013.

===Zastava M97===
The Zastava M97 is a Serbian clone of the Mini Uzi. Two variants consist of the M97 with an barrel and the M97K with a barrel and no folding stock with a vertical foregrip permanent attached.

===Hamas clone===
From 1993 to 1996, Hamas manufactured a total of 350 Uzi clones, until its production was dismantled by the Palestinian Security Services&#x27; intelligence unit led by Moussa Arafat.

<text>Clermont-Ferrand (, , ; or simply ; ) is a city and commune of France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, with a population of 147,284 (2020). Its metropolitan area () had 504,157 inhabitants at the 2018 census. It is the prefecture (capital) of the Puy-de-Dôme département. Olivier Bianchi is its current mayor.

Clermont-Ferrand sits on the plain of Limagne in the Massif Central and is surrounded by a major industrial area. The city is known for the chain of volcanoes, the Chaîne des Puys, which surround it. This includes the dormant volcano Puy de Dôme, 10 kilometres (6 miles) away, one of the highest in the surrounding area, which is topped by communications towers and visible from the city. Clermont-Ferrand has been listed as a &quot;tectonic hotspot&quot; since July 2018 on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

One of the oldest French cities, it was known by Greeks as the capital of the Arvernie tribe before developing in the Gallo-Roman era under the name of Augustonemetum in the 1st century BC. The forum of the Roman city was located on the top of the Clermont mound, on the site of the present cathedral. During the decline of the Western Roman Empire it was subjected to repeated looting by the peoples who invaded Gaul, including Vandals, Alans, Visigoths and Franks. It was later raided by Vikings as the Carolingian Empire weakened in the early Middle Ages. Growing in importance under the Capetian dynasty, in 1095 it hosted the Council of Clermont, where Pope Urban II called the First Crusade. In 1551, Clermont became a royal town, and was declared an inseparable property of the Crown in 1610.

Today Clermont-Ferrand hosts the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival (), one of the world&#x27;s leading festivals for short films. It is also home to the corporate headquarters of Michelin, the global tyre company founded in the city more than 100 years ago. With a quarter of the municipal population being students, and some 6,000 researchers, Clermont-Ferrand is the first city in France to join the UNESCO Learning City Network.

Along with its highly distinctive black lava stone Gothic styled Cathedral, Clermont-Ferrand&#x27;s other famous sites include the public square Place de Jaude, in which stands a grand statue of Vercingetorix astride a warhorse and brandishing a sword. The inscription reads ). This statue was sculpted by Frédéric Bartholdi, who also created the Statue of Liberty.

==History==
===Name===

Clermont-Ferrand&#x27;s first name was &quot;Augustonemetum&quot;, Latin for &quot;sanctuary for Augustus&quot;, or &quot;Civitas Arvernorum&quot; (town of the Arverni people). It originated on the central knoll where the cathedral is situated today, overlooking the capital of . The fortified castle of Clarus Mons gave its name to the whole town in 848, to which the small episcopal town of Montferrand was attached in 1731, together taking the name of Clermont-Ferrand. The amalgamation of the two towns was decreed by Louis XIII and confirmed by Louis XV. The old part of Clermont is delimited by the route of the ramparts as they existed at the end of the Middle Ages.

===Prehistory and Roman era===

Clermont ranks among the oldest cities of France. The first known mention was by the Greek geographer Strabo, who called it the &quot;metropolis of the Arverni&quot; (meaning their &quot;oppidum civitas&quot; or tribal capital). The city was at that time called &quot;Nemessos&quot; – a Gaulish word for a sacred forest, and was situated on the mound where the cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand stands today. Somewhere in the area around Nemossos, the Arverni chieftain Vercingetorix (later to head a unified Gallic resistance to the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar) was born around 72 BC. Nemossos was situated not far from the plateau of Gergovia, where Vercingetorix repulsed the Roman assault at the Battle of Gergovia in 52 BC. After the Roman conquest, the city became known as &quot;Augustonemetum&quot;.

===Early Middle Ages===
The city became the seat of a bishop in the 5th century, at the time of the bishop Namatius, who built a cathedral here described by Gregory of Tours. Clermont went through a dark period after the disappearance of the Roman Empire and during the High Middle Ages was pillaged by the peoples who invaded Gaul. Between 471 and 475, Auvergne was often the target of Visigothic expansion, and the city was frequently besieged, including once by Euric. Although defended by Sidonius Apollinaris, at the head of the diocese from 468 to 486, and the patrician Ecdicius, the city was ceded to the Visigoths by emperor Julius Nepos in 475 and remained part of the Visigothic kingdom until 507. A generation later, it became part of the Kingdom of the Franks. On 8 November 535 the first Council of Clermont opened at Arvernis (Clermont), with fifteen bishops participating, including Caesarius of Arles, Nizier of Lyons, the Bishop of Trier, and Saint Hilarius, Bishop of Mende. The Council issued 16 decrees. The second canon reiterated the principle that the granting of episcopal dignity must be made according to merit and not as a result of intrigues.

In 570, Bishop Avitus ordered the Jews of the city, who numbered over 500, to accept Christian baptism or be expelled.

In 848, the city was renamed &quot;Clairmont&quot;, after the castle Clarus Mons. During this era, it was an episcopal city ruled by its bishop. Clermont was not spared by the Vikings at the time of the weakening of the Carolingian Empire: it was ravaged by the Normans under Hastein in 862 and 864 and, while its bishop Sigon carried out reconstruction work, again in 898 (or 910, according to some sources). Bishop Étienne II built a new Romanesque cathedral which was consecrated in 946. It was almost entirely replaced by the current Gothic cathedral, though the crypt survives and the towers were only replaced in the 19th century.

===Middle Ages===

Clermont was the starting point of the First Crusade, in which Christendom sought to retake Muslim-ruled Jerusalem. Pope Urban II called for the crusade in 1095 at the Second Council of Clermont. In 1120, following repeated crises between the counts of Auvergne and the bishops of Clermont and in order to counteract the clergy&#x27;s power, the counts founded the rival city of Montferrand on a mound next to the fortifications of Clermont, on the model of the new cities of the Midi that appeared in the 12th and 13th centuries. Until the early modern period, the two remained separate cities: Clermont, an episcopal city; Montferrand, a comital one.

===Early modern and modern eras===

Clermont became a royal city in 1551, and in 1610, the inseparable property of the French Crown. On 15 April 1630 the Edict of Troyes (the First Edict of Union) joined the two cities of Clermont and Montferrand. This union was confirmed in 1731 by Louis XV with the Second Edict of Union. At this time, Montferrand was no more than a satellite city of Clermont, and it remained so until the beginning of the 20th century. Wishing to retain its independence, Montferrand made three demands for independence, in 1789, 1848, and 1863. The Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) was completed in 1844.

In the 20th century, the construction of the Michelin factories and of city gardens, which shaped modern Clermont-Ferrand, united the two cities, although two distinct downtowns survive and Montferrand retains a strong identity.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Clermont-Ferrand has an oceanic climate (Cfb). The city is in the rain shadow of the Chaîne des Puys, giving it one of the driest climates in metropolitan France, except for a few places around the Mediterranean Sea. The mountains also block most of the oceanic influence of the Atlantic, which creates a much more continental climate than in nearby cities west or north of the mountains, like Limoges and Montluçon. Thus the city has comparatively cold winters and hot summers. From November to March, frost is very frequent, and the city, being at the bottom of a valley, is frequently subject to temperature inversion, in which the mountains are sunny and warm, and the plain is freezing cold and cloudy. Snow is quite common, although usually short-lived and light. Summer temperatures often exceed , with sometimes violent thunderstorms. The highest temperature was reached in 2019 of while the lowest was .
===Main sights===
====Religious architecture====

Clermont-Ferrand has two famous churches. One is Notre-Dame du Port, a Romanesque church which was built during the 11th and 12th centuries (the bell tower was rebuilt during the 19th century). It was nominated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1998. The other is Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral (&quot;Cathédrale Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Assomption de Clermont-Ferrand&quot;), built in Gothic style between the 13th and the 19th centuries.

====Parks and gardens====

* Jardin Lecoq
* Parc de Montjuzet
* Jardin botanique de la Charme
* Arboretum de Royat
* Jardin botanique d&#x27;Auvergne

== Economy and infrastructure ==
Food production and processing as well as engineering are major employers in the area, as are the many research facilities of leading computer software and pharmaceutical companies.

The city&#x27;s industry was for a long time linked to the French tyre manufacturer Michelin, which created the radial tyre and expanded from Clermont-Ferrand to become a worldwide leader in its industry. For most of the 20th century, it had extensive factories throughout the city, employing up to 30,000 workers. While the company has maintained its headquarters in the city, most of the manufacturing is now done in foreign countries. This downsizing took place gradually, allowing the city to court new investment in other industries, thus avoiding the fate of many post-industrial cities and keeping it a very wealthy and prosperous area home to many high-income executives.

=== Transport ===

The main railway station has connections to Paris and several regional destinations: Lyon, Moulins via Vichy, Le Puy-en-Velay, Aurillac, Nîmes, Issoire, Montluçon and Thiers.

The A71 motorway connects Clermont-Ferrand with Orléans and Bourges, the A75 with Montpellier and the A89 with Bordeaux, Lyon and Saint-Étienne (A72). The airport offers flights within France. Recently, Clermont-Ferrand was France&#x27;s first city to get a new Translohr transit system, the Clermont-Ferrand Tramway, thereby linking the city&#x27;s north and south neighbourhoods.

The TGV will arrive in Auvergne after 2030. It will be one of the last regions not to have a TGV stop.

Clermont-Ferrand Auvergne Airport serves only a handful of mostly domestic destinations.

==Culture==

Clermont-Ferrand was the home of mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal, who tested Evangelista Torricelli&#x27;s hypothesis concerning the influence of gas pressure on liquid equilibrium. This is the experiment in which a vacuum is created in a mercury tube; Pascal&#x27;s experiment had his brother-in-law carry a barometer to the top of the Puy-de-Dôme. The Université Blaise-Pascal (or Clermont-Ferrand II) was located primarily in the city and is named after him.

Clermont-Ferrand also hosts the Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival, the world&#x27;s first international short film festival, which originated in 1979. This festival, which brings thousands of people every year (137,000 in 2008) to the city, is the second French film Festival after Cannes in terms of visitors, but ranks first for spectators (in Cannes, visitors are not allowed in theatres, only professionals). This festival has revealed many young talented directors who are now well known in France and internationally, such as Mathieu Kassovitz, Cédric Klapisch and Éric Zonka.

Beside the short film festival, Clermont-Ferrand hosts more than twenty music, film, dance, theatre and video and digital art festivals every year. With more than 800 artistic groups from dance to music, Clermont-Ferrand and the Auvergne region&#x27;s cultural life is significant in France. One of the city&#x27;s nicknames is &quot;The Liverpool of France&quot;. Groups such as The Elderberries and Cocoon were formed there.

Additionally, the city was the subject of the acclaimed documentary &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;, which used Clermont-Ferrand as the basis of the film, telling the story of France under Nazi occupation and the Vichy regime of Marshal Pétain. Pierre Laval, Pétain&#x27;s &quot;handman&quot;, was an &quot;Auvergnat&quot;.

&quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; (), a 1969 French drama film by Éric Rohmer, was set and filmed in Clermont-Ferrand in and around Christmas Eve. It is the third film (fourth in order of release) in his series of &quot;Six Moral Tales&quot;. Pascal&#x27;s wager, a philosophical and theological thought experiment from Blaise Pascal&#x27;s &quot;Pensées&quot;, is a major theme in the film. Pascal was born in Clermont-Ferrand in 1623.

The city also hosts &quot;L&#x27;Aventure Michelin&quot;, the museum dedicated to the history of Michelin group.

===Sport===
A racing circuit close to the city, the Charade Circuit, using closed-off public roads, held the French Grand Prix in 1965, 1969, 1970 and 1972. It was a daunting circuit, with such harsh elevation changes that some drivers became ill as they drove. Winners included Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart (twice), and Jochen Rindt.

Clermont-Ferrand has some experience in hosting major international sports tournaments, including the FIBA EuroBasket 1999. The city was the finish of Tour de France stages in 1951 and 1959, and will host the start of the 2023 Tour de France Femmes.

The city is also home to a rugby union club competing at international level, ASM Clermont Auvergne, as well as Clermont Foot Auvergne, a football club that has competed in France&#x27;s top tier, Ligue 1, since the 2021/22 season.

In the sevens version of rugby union, Clermont-Ferrand has hosted the France Women&#x27;s Sevens, the final event in each season&#x27;s World Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Series, since 2016.

<text>The 1960 Summer Olympics (), officially known as the Games of the XVII Olympiad () and commonly known as Rome 1960 (), were an international multi-sport event held from 25 August to 11 September 1960 in Rome, Italy. Rome had previously been awarded the administration of the 1908 Summer Olympics. However, following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, the city had no choice but to decline and pass the honour to London. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals at the 1960 Games.

The 1st Paralympic Games were held in Rome in conjunction with the 1960 Summer Olympics, marking the first time such events coincided.

==Host city selection==
On 15 June 1955, at the 50th IOC Session in Paris, France, Rome won the right to host the 1960 Games, having beaten Brussels, Mexico City, Tokyo, Detroit, Budapest and finally Lausanne. Tokyo and Mexico City would subsequently host the proceeding 1964 and 1968 Summer Olympics respectively.

Toronto was initially interested in the bidding, but was automatically removed from consideration when it failed to return the IOC&#x27;s mandatory questionnaire by the deadline. The questionnaire may have been mislaid in the confusion following the death of the Toronto bid&#x27;s chief organiser, Robert Hood Saunders, in a plane crash weeks before the deadline. This was the first of five unsuccessful attempts by Toronto to secure the Summer Olympics, the most recent being a bid for the 2008 Games. 

==Highlights==

* Swedish sprint canoeist Gert Fredriksson won his sixth Olympic title.
* Fencer Aladár Gerevich of Hungary won his sixth consecutive gold medal in the team sabre event.
* The Japanese men&#x27;s gymnastics team won the first of five successive golds (see 1976 Summer Olympics).
* The United States men&#x27;s national basketball team—led by promising college players Walt Bellamy, Jerry Lucas, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West—captured its fifth straight Olympic gold medal.
* Danish sailor Paul Elvstrøm won his fourth straight gold medal in the Finn class. Others to emulate his performance in an individual event are Al Oerter, Carl Lewis, Michael Phelps, Kaori Icho, Mijaín López and, if the Intercalated (Interspaced) Games of 1906 are included, Ray Ewry.
* German Armin Hary won the 100 metres in an Olympic record time of 10.2 seconds. American Dave Sime also ran 10.2 s in the final, but was credited with silver after a controversial video review.
* Wilma Rudolph, a former polio patient, won three gold medals in sprint events on the track. She was acclaimed as &quot;the fastest woman in the world&quot;.
* Jeff Farrell won two gold medals in swimming. He underwent an emergency appendectomy six days before the Olympic Trials.

* Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia won the marathon barefooted to become the first African and Ethiopian Olympic champion.
* 18-year-old Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, won boxing&#x27;s light-heavyweight gold medal. Ramon &quot;Buddy&quot; Carr was his coach.
* Herb Elliott of Australia won the men&#x27;s 1500 meters in one of the most dominating performances in Olympic history.
* Rafer Johnson defeated his rival, fellow U.C.L.A. Bruin and friend C.K. Yang in one of the greatest Decathlon events in Olympic history.
* Lance Larson of the United States was controversially denied a 100 metres freestyle swimming gold, despite showing the best time.
* 16-years-old phenom Chris von Saltza won four medals in women&#x27;s swimming, three of them gold.
* The future Constantine II, last King of Greece (abdicated and ended hybrid monarchy, 1973) won his country a gold in sailing: dragon class.
* The Pakistani Men&#x27;s Field Hockey team broke a run of Indian team victories since 1928, defeating India in the final and winning Pakistan&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal.
* Wrestlers Shelby Wilson, and Doug Blubaugh, who wrestled together growing up, won gold medals in their respective weight classes.

===Lowlights===
* Danish cyclist Knud Jensen collapsed during the 100km team race because of heat stroke and later died in the hospital. It was suspected that he had been under the influence of Roniacol, a blood circulation stimulant. The International Olympic Committee stated on its website that &quot;drugs were implicated, although that was never proven.&quot; It was the second time (and as of 2024, the most recent) an athlete died in competition at the Olympics, after the death of Portuguese marathon runner Francisco Lázaro at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

===Historical landmarks===
* South Africa appeared in the Olympic arena for the last time under its apartheid regime. It would not be allowed to return until 1992, by when apartheid in sport was being abolished.
* Singapore competed for the first time under its own flag, which was to become its national flag after independence, as the British had granted it self-government a year earlier. Tan Howe Liang won silver in the Weightlifting lightweight category, which was the first time (and the only time until 2008) that an athlete from Singapore won an Olympic medal.

===Non-medal winners===
* Finnish Vilho Ylönen, a field shooter, shot a bullseye to a wrong target, and in doing so he dropped from second place to fourth.
* Peter Camejo, a 2004 American vice-presidential candidate for the Green Party, competed in yachting for Venezuela.
* The future Queen Sofía of Spain represented her native Greece in sailing events.

==Broadcasting==
* CBS paid (equivalent to $ in ) for the exclusive right to broadcast the Games in the United States. This was the first Summer Olympic games to be telecast in North America. In addition to CBS in the United States, the Olympics were telecast for the first time in Canada (on CBC Television) and in Mexico (through the networks of Telesistema Mexicano). Since television broadcast satellites were still two years into the future, CBS, CBC, and TSM shot and edited videotapes in Rome, fed the tapes to Paris where they were re-recorded onto other tapes which were then loaded onto jet planes to North America. Planes carrying the tapes landed at Idlewild Airport in New York City, where mobile units fed the tapes to CBS, to Toronto for the CBC, and to Mexico City for TSM. Despite this arrangement, many daytime events were broadcast in North America, especially on CBS and CBC, the same day they took place.

<text>The Victoria University of Manchester, usually referred to as simply the University of Manchester, was a university in Manchester, England. It was founded in 1851 as Owens College. In 1880, the college joined the federal Victoria University. After the demerger of the Victoria University, it gained an independent university charter in 1904 as the Victoria University of Manchester.

On 1 October 2004, the Victoria University of Manchester merged with the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) to form a new, larger entity named the University of Manchester.

==History==

===1851–1951===

Owens College was founded in 1851, named after John Owens, a textile merchant, who left a bequest of £96,942 for the purpose. Its first accommodation was at Cobden House on Quay Street, Manchester, in a house which had been the residence of Richard Cobden. In 1859, Owens College was approved as a provincial examination centre for matriculation candidates of the University of London. As the college progressed the premises became inadequate so a move to Chorlton on Medlock was planned in 1871. Alfred Waterhouse was the architect of the new college building, west of Oxford Road, which was opened in 1873.

Owens College became the first affiliate college of the federal Victoria University in 1880. In 1884, University College Liverpool also joined the Victoria University, followed in 1887 by the Yorkshire College in Leeds. In 1903, University College Liverpool left the Victoria University to become the independent University of Liverpool; Leeds followed in 1904 to become the University of Leeds.

The new Victoria University of Manchester was established by royal charter on 15 July 1903; the university and Owens College were merged by Act of Parliament on 24 June 1904. The Manchester University Press was founded by James Tait in 1904 (as the Publications Committee of the University), initially to publish academic research being undertaken at the Victoria University of Manchester. The office was accommodated in a house in Lime Grove. Distribution was then in the hands of Sherratt &amp; Hughes of Manchester; from 1913 the distributors were Longmans, Green &amp; Co. though this arrangement came to an end in the 1930s. The MUP offices moved several times to make way for other developments within the university. Since 1951 these have been Grove House, Oxford Road, then the former University Dental Hospital of Manchester (&quot;illustrated&quot;) and until the present time the Manchester Medical School in Coupland Street.

===1951–2004===
In the mid-1960s the university and the city corporation commissioned Hugh Wilson and Lewis Womersley to produce a new plan for the campus. The final report was issued in 1966; it recommended removing traffic from Oxford Road to the adjacent main routes east and west, and building of the Precinct Centre – subsequently constructed in 1970–1972. The Precinct Centre building included the oldest part of the Manchester Business School, Devonshire House and Crawford House and St Peter&#x27;s House, the University Chaplaincy. It stood on Booth Street East and Booth Street West and Oxford Road ran through it at ground level. The architects were Wilson &amp; Womersley, in association with the university&#x27;s planning officer, H. Thomas; for St Peter&#x27;s House the architects were Cruickshank &amp; Seward. The Precinct Centre was the largest public building completed in the campus redevelopment, containing office and shopping space, a pub, library and post office amongst other town centre facilities, designed to separate pedestrians from traffic.

The Precinct Centre was demolished in August 2015 as part of Manchester University&#x27;s £50m redevelopment of Manchester Business School.

On 5 March 2003 it was announced that the university was to merge with UMIST on 1 October 2004, to form the largest conventional university in the UK, the University of Manchester, following which the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST would cease to exist. The new university was inaugurated on 1 October 2004.

The university had more than 18,000 full-time students (including 2500 international students from more than 120 countries) by the time it merged with UMIST. It was regarded as one of the top universities in the country, frequently achieving top ratings for research.

==Officers==
:&quot;See also :Category:Vice-chancellors of the Victoria University of Manchester&quot;

The chief officers of the university were the vice-chancellor, the registrar, the bursar and the librarian. In later years many administrative changes were made that increased the independence of the Director of Estates and Services, the Director of the Manchester Computing Centre, and eventually combined the offices of registrar and bursar as that of registrar and secretary, the last holder of this post was Eddie Newcomb (1995–2004).

==Notable people==

In the early decades of Owens College, a few outstanding faculty members set high standards for the new institution. These included statistician Stanley Jevons, jurist James Bryce, William Eyre Walker (Art Master) and particularly Henry Enfield Roscoe Professor of Chemistry and Principal of the college. It also educated the young J. J. Thomson before he went to Trinity College, Cambridge

Since the later 1800s, many notable people have worked and studied at the Victoria University of Manchester as, for example, Benedict Cumberbatch.

==Motto and arms==
The motto of the university was &quot;Arduus ad solem&quot;, meaning &quot;striving towards the sun&quot;. It is a metaphor for aspiring to enlightenment. It is quoted from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Book II, and the archives do not record the reasons for its choice. The original verse refers to a serpent and the sun, both of which featured in the university coat of arms. The serpent is traditionally associated with wisdom. The arms were granted in October 1871 to Owens College while the Victoria University had arms of its own which fell into abeyance from 1904 upon the merger of the college with the University.

According to Norman Marlow (A. N. Marlow, Senior Lecturer in Latin, Department of Classics at the university in the 1960s), the motto &quot;Arduus ad solem&quot; – taken from Aeneid II – was a play on words, relating to Manchester&#x27;s geographical situation. The Virgilian context referred to Pyrrhus, appearing in shining armour &#x27;like a snake which has sloughed its skin, reaching upwards with an effort towards the sun&#x27;; the motto was chosen by the Professor of Latin at the time (Augustus Wilkins) and the coat of arms was applied for – suggesting both the idea of the institution striving towards excellence, and the city (with its particularly high annual rainfall) &#x27;reaching upwards with difficulty towards the sun&#x27;.

The emblem of the university in use for a number of years (last used September 2004) was based on the archway into the quadrangle from Oxford Road, where there are two coats of arms, of the Victoria University and the Victoria University of Manchester, flanking the gates.

<text>Yacht racing is a sailing sport involving sailing yachts and larger sailboats, as distinguished from dinghy racing, which involves open boats. It is composed of multiple yachts, in direct competition, racing around a course marked by buoys or other fixed navigational devices or racing longer distances across open water from point-to-point. It can involve a series of races with buoy racing or multiple legs when point-to-point racing.

==History==
Yachting, that is, recreational boating, is very old, as exemplified in the ancient poem Catullus 4:

&lt;poem&gt;
The yacht you see there, friends, 
says that she&#x27;s been
The fastest piece of timber ever seen;
She swears that once she could have overhauled
All rival boats, whether the challenge called
For racing under canvas or with oars.
&lt;/poem&gt;
(trans. James Michie)

&quot;Yacht&quot; is referred to as deriving from either Norwegian (&quot;jagt&quot;), Middle Low German (&quot;jaght&quot;) or from the Dutch word jacht, which means &quot;a swift light vessel of war, commerce or pleasure. The sporting element in the word lies in the derivation of jaght from the root jaghen, which means to hunt, chase or pursue….&quot;

The formal racing of boats is believed to have started with sailboats in the Netherlands sometime in the 17th century. Soon, in England, custom-built racing &quot;yachts&quot; began to emerge and the Royal Yacht Squadron was established in 1815. In 1661 John Evelyn recorded a competition between &quot;Katherine&quot; and &quot;Anne&quot;, two large royal sailing vessels both of English design, &quot;…the wager 100-1; the race from Greenwich to Gravesend and back.&quot; One of the vessels was owned, and sometimes steered, by Charles II.

In 1782, the Cumberland Fleet, a class of sailing vessel known for its ability to sail close to the wind, were painted racing up the Thames River with spectators viewing from a bridge. Much like today, this obsession with sailing close to the wind with speed and efficiency fueled the racing community.

In the 19th century, most yacht races were started by allotting starting positions to the competitors. Buoys were laid in a straight line, to which the competitors attached their yachts by means of spring ropes. The yachts were required to keep all the sails forward of the mainmast on deck until the starting signal was given. 
The Yacht Racing Association was founded in 1875 by Prince Batthyany-Strattman, Captain J. W. Hughes, and Mr. Dixon Kemp. The Y.R.A. wrote standardised yacht racing rules which included the &#x27;Flying Start&#x27; used today.

Bringing yacht racing to the forefront of public life, the America&#x27;s Cup was first raced in 1851 between the New York Yacht Club and the Royal Yacht Squadron. Not ruled or regulated by measurement criteria as today, it is the second-place finisher was Aurora, &quot;and but for the fact that time allowance had been waived for the race she would have been the winner by a handsome margin.&quot; Subsequently, the Cup races were conducted, usually every three to four years, based on a challenge issued by one club to the current Cup holder, which until 1983 was the NYYC.

As at 2017, the La Ciotat Based Yacht Partridge 1885 is documented as being the world&#x27;s oldest, still fully operational classic racing yacht.

==Rules and ratings==

As yacht racing became more prevalent, and yacht design more diverse, it was necessary to establish systems of measurements and time allowances due to the differences in boat design. Longer yachts are inherently faster than shorter ones; therefore, in the interests of fairness, in the 1820s a “primitive system of time allowance was introduced on the Solent.” Larger yachts were handicapped; but owners with the biggest vessels had a problem with the allowance system, for they preferred that crossing the finish line first, much as in foot and horse races, should suffice to win the contest. As a result, both ratings and “one-design” competition were developed.

Ratings systems rely upon some formulaic analysis of usually very specific yacht-design parameters such as length, sail area, displacement, and hull shape. During the 1920s and through the 1970s the Cruising Club of America established a formula by which most racing/cruising boats were designed during that period. After its descendant, the mathematically complex International Offshore Rule (IOR) of the 1970s, contributed to much decreased seaworthiness (and even speed), the simpler Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF) system was adopted. The PHRF uses only proven performance characteristics, especially theoretical sailing speed, as a means to allow dissimilar yachts—typically crewed by friends and families at clubs rather than by professional crews—to race together. Most popular family-oriented cruising sailboats will have a rating filed with a local chapter of the PHRF.

The most prevalent handicap rating systems today are the Offshore Racing Congress (ORC), Offshore Racing Rule (ORR), International Rating Certificate (IRC), and the Performance Handicap Racing Fleet (PHRF). Many countries organise their own handicap systems which do not take into account the size, weight, or sail area of the yacht, but performance is measured on the basis of previous race results. The Irish E.C.H.O. system is such a handicap system.

One-design racing was invented by Thomas (Ben) Middleton in 1886 in Killiney Bay close to Dublin City, Republic of Ireland. Middleton was concerned that winning a yacht race was more reliant on having an expensive new yacht, than it was on the skill of the yachtsman. One design yacht racing is conducted with classes of similar boats, all built—often via mass-production—to the same design, with the same sail area and rig, and the same number of crew, so that crew ability and tactical expertise are more likely to decide a race than boat type, or age, or even weather. Popular racing boats such as The Water Wag, Laser, the J/22 and J/24, the Etchells, and the Star and New York 30 of Nathanael Herreshoff are examples of one-design boats.

In general, modern yacht-racing contests are conducted according to the Racing Rules of Sailing, first established in 1928. Though complex, the RRS are intended primarily simply ensure fairness and safety. The Rules are revised and updated every four years by the body now known as World Sailing.

Some yacht-racing rules give &quot;line honours&quot; to the first boat to cross the finish line and &quot;handicap honours&quot; to the corrected time winner, which may be a slower boat with a lower handicap.

==Notable races==
The major races of today can be classified as inshore, offshore, ocean, and around the world. They adhere to one set of rules, but use diverse handicapping standards.

===Inshore===
The Admiral&#x27;s Cup was created in 1957 by the Admiral of the Royal Ocean Racing Club. Each country involved is allowed to send one team and three boats of a chosen one-design class. Formerly it was raced every two years. It appears that due to international disagreements that this event no longer takes place.

The America&#x27;s Cup was established in 1851. This is the oldest, and arguably the most prestigious, event in yacht racing. Participants are restricted to a measurement formula for the boats, and the rules concerning this formula have been controversial since the beginning. The English, who were the challengers for the first 132 years of the race, commented &quot;England rules the waves, but America waives the rules.&quot; This race was not traditionally an inshore race, due to the requirement that the British boat would sail to the racing area, which involved sailing trans-Atlantically.

The Auckland Anniversary Regatta was founded in 1840. It includes the Heather Cup, which has been contested on over 170 yearly occasions since establishment. (It was halted briefly during the Second Boer War.)

===Offshore===
The Vic-Maui Yacht Race runs from Victoria, Canada to Lahaina, Hawaii — a distance of 2,308 nautical miles ((4,274 km)). The race was started in 1965 and is held every other year. It is the longest of the Pacific-Hawaii races.

The Transpacific Yacht Race (Transpac) starts off Point Fermin (San Pedro, near Los Angeles) and ends off Diamond Head Lighthouse in Honolulu — a distance of around . It is one of yachting&#x27;s premier offshore races, attracting entrants from all over the world. Started in 1906, the race is organized by the Transpacific Yacht Club.

Fastnet was established in 1924 with 7 boats. The race covers approximately 600 miles starting at Cowes on the Isle of Wight, rounding Fastnet rock on the southern coast of Ireland, and finishing at Cherbourg, France. Until 2019, the race finished at Plymouth.

The Tour De France A La Voile was established in 1978 with 20 boats. The race parallels the cycling event and takes place along France&#x27;s three coasts: English Channel, Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean. It covers over 1000 miles.

The Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race was established in 1945. This Australian race runs from Sydney, New South Wales to Hobart, Tasmania — a distance of over .

The Newport to Bermuda race started in 1906. It runs from Newport, Rhode Island to Bermuda.

The Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac was founded in 1898 with five boats. The race runs over 300 miles, from Chicago to Mackinac Island on the northern tip of the lower peninsula of Michigan.

The Marblehead to Halifax race was founded in 1905. The race runs for over 360 miles, from Marblehead, Massachusetts to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

The Coastal Classic, started in 1982, is held in New Zealand. At about 125 miles, it is shorter than most offshore races. It runs north from Auckland to Russell, which is at the northern tip of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

===Oceanic===
Ostar was organised by the Royal Western Yacht Club and first held in 1960. The Ostar runs from Plymouth to Newport (in 1960 the finish line was in New York). It is a single-handed race against the prevailing wind and current in the North Atlantic. The race is held every 4 years but has become an amateur race in the early 21st century. Originally, the Ostar was the main race for offshore sailors, but has meanwhile lost its status to the Route du Rhum. The race covers about 3,000 miles.

Route Du Rhum was established in 1978. This race happens every four years, starting in November. It is primarily a single-handed race, but crewed boats do compete. It starts in France&#x27;s north coast and runs to Guadeloupe, a French Island in the Caribbean. The race covers about 3700 miles.

Mini Transat started in 1977 and runs every two years. This is a singlehanded race that crosses the Atlantic on a similar route as the Route Du Rhum. This race is broken up into two legs, the first going from France to the Canary Islands and the second to Guadeloupe Island in the Caribbean.

The South Atlantic Race was established in 1971 as &quot;Cape to Rio&quot; with over 50 entries. The race runs from Cape Town, South Africa to Rio de Janeiro — some 3600 miles.

The Round Ireland Yacht Race is held bi-annually. Running approximately 704 miles, it starts and finishes in Wicklow, and includes all the offshore islands except Rockall.

===Around-the-world===
* The Ocean Race – formerly known as The Volvo Ocean Race as well as the Whitbread Round the World Race, it started in 1973/74. This race is one of the pinnacles of yacht racing, mostly professionally crewed. Originally a four leg race constituting 27,930 miles, it is now a nine leg race.
* Velux 5 Oceans Race – formerly known as the BOC Challenge and later the Around Alone, this race started in 1982 with 17 entries. It is a single-handed race around the world, originally with 4 legs but now with 3.
* Global Challenge – this race was established in 1992/93 by Scottish sailing icon Sir Chay Blythe, the first person to sail around the world alone against the prevailing winds and currents. This is what makes this race unique, participants “beat” their way against the sea which makes for very uncomfortable, but safer, sailing conditions than sailing downwind. The race is sailed in one-design boats that are designed and built specifically for the race. The crews cannot be professional, and are made up of novice sailors who pay for a berth.
* Vendée Globe – this race, known as the &quot;Everest of the Seas&quot; for its difficulty, started November 26, 1989 with 13 entries. It is a single handed, non-stop, without assistance race. The first race took 120 days, and only 7 finished.
* Jules Verne Trophy – established in 1993 the race was designed to be a race against the clock, not other boats. Participants can start any time, have any design, any number of crew, and the only two rules are: 1)start and finish at the Ile d’Ouessant, and 2) complete the journey under 80 days.
* Clipper Round the World Yacht Race - established by Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first man to perform a single-handed non-stop circumnavigation of the globe, the first Clipper race took place in 1996. The race is sailed in a fleet of 12 one-design boats that are designed and built specifically for the race. Each yacht is crewed by a professional skipper and paying novice sailors. It is the longest yacht race, with multiple stopovers and taking 11 months to complete the circumnavigation.
* Barcelona World Race – double-handed (two-crew) non-stop sailing around the world on IMOCA Open 60 yachts and organized by Fundació Navegació Oceànica Barcelona.

<text>The S1G reactor is a naval reactor used by the United States Navy to provide electricity generation and propulsion on warships. The S1G designation stands for:

* S = Submarine platform
* 1 = First generation core designed by the contractor
* G = General Electric was the contracted designer

== History ==
This nuclear reactor was constructed by General Electric as a prototype for the USS &quot;Seawolf&quot; (SSN-575) submarine. It was a liquid metal cooled reactor using pure sodium to cool the core instead of water, because the higher temperature of liquid sodium (compared to pressurized water) enabled the production of more superheated steam in the steam generators. This resulted in a more efficient thermal cycle, yielding more shaft horsepower for a given reactor size. The reactor design had problems because of limited operating temperature constraints. The major disadvantage of this concept was the ignition of sodium when exposed to air. The reactor core was beryllium-moderated.

S1G was used for testing and training. Eventually a sodium leak resulted in a fire, and the facility was shut down. In the meantime, the S1W and S2W pressurized water reactors, conceived for the USS &quot;Nautilus&quot; (SSN-571), had demonstrated their superior reliability. The S1G reactor facility and its Horton sphere were later reused for the D1G prototype destroyer reactor.

<text>The University of Manchester is a public research university in Manchester, England. The main campus is south of Manchester City Centre on Oxford Road. The university owns and operates major cultural assets such as the Manchester Museum, The Whitworth art gallery, the John Rylands Library, the Tabley House Collection and the Jodrell Bank Observatory – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The University of Manchester is considered a red brick university, a product of the civic university movement of the late 19th century. The current University of Manchester was formed in 2004 following the merger of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) and the Victoria University of Manchester. This followed a century of the two institutions working closely with one another.

The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology had its origins in the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, which was founded in 1824. The present University of Manchester considers this date, which is also the date of foundation of the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery, one of the predecessor institutions of the Victoria University of Manchester, as its official foundation year, as indicated in its crest and logo. The founders of the institute believed that all professions somewhat relied on scientific principles. As such, the institute taught working individuals branches of science applicable to their existing occupations. They believed that the practical application of science would encourage innovation and advancements within those trades and professions. The Victoria University of Manchester was founded in 1851, as Owens College. Academic research undertaken by the university was published via the Manchester University Press from 1904.

Manchester is the third-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment and receives over 92,000 undergraduate applications per year, making it the most popular university in the UK by volume of applications. The University of Manchester is a member of the Russell Group, the N8 Group, and the US-based Universities Research Association. The University of Manchester, inclusive of its predecessor institutions, has had 26 Nobel laureates amongst its past and present students and staff, the fourth-highest number of any single university in the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Origins (1824 to 2004)===
The University of Manchester traces its roots to the formation of the Mechanics&#x27; Institute (later UMIST) in 1824, and its heritage is linked to Manchester&#x27;s pride in being the world&#x27;s first industrial city. The English chemist John Dalton, together with Manchester businessmen and industrialists, established the Mechanics&#x27; Institute to ensure that workers could learn the basic principles of science.

John Owens, a textile merchant, left a bequest of £96,942 in 1846 (around £5.6 million in 2005 prices) to found a college to educate men on non-sectarian lines. His trustees established Owens College in 1851 in a house on the corner of Quay Street and Byrom Street which had been the home of the philanthropist Richard Cobden, and subsequently housed Manchester County Court. The locomotive designer Charles Beyer became a governor of the college and was the largest single donor to the college extension fund, which raised the money to move to a new site and construct the main building now known as the John Owens building. He also campaigned and helped fund the engineering chair, the first applied science department in the north of England. He left the college the equivalent of £10 million in his will in 1876, at a time when it was in great financial difficulty. Beyer funded the total cost of construction of the Beyer Building to house the biology and geology departments. His will also funded Engineering chairs and the Beyer Professor of Applied mathematics.

The university has a rich German heritage. The Owens College Extension Movement formed their plans after a tour of mainly German universities and polytechnics. A Manchester mill owner, Thomas Ashton, chairman of the extension movement, had studied at Heidelberg University. Sir Henry Roscoe also studied at Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen and they collaborated for many years on research projects. Roscoe promoted the German style of research-led teaching that became the role model for the red-brick universities. Charles Beyer studied at Dresden Academy Polytechnic. There were many Germans on the staff, including Carl Schorlemmer, Britain&#x27;s first chair in organic chemistry, and Arthur Schuster, professor of physics. There was even a German chapel on the campus.

In 1873, Owens College moved to new premises on Oxford Road, Chorlton-on-Medlock, and from 1880 it was a constituent college of the federal Victoria University. This university was established and granted a royal charter in 1880, becoming England&#x27;s first civic university; following Liverpool and Leeds becoming independent, it was renamed the Victoria University of Manchester in 1903 and absorbed Owens College the following year.

By 1905, the two institutions were large and active forces. The Municipal College of Technology, forerunner of UMIST, was the Victoria University of Manchester&#x27;s Faculty of Technology while continuing in parallel as a technical college offering advanced courses of study. Although UMIST achieved independent university status in 1955, the universities continued to work together. However, in the late-20th century, formal connections between the university and UMIST diminished and in 1994 most of the remaining institutional ties were severed as new legislation allowed UMIST to become an autonomous university with powers to award its own degrees. A decade later the development was reversed. The Victoria University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology agreed to merge into a single institution in March 2003.

Before the merger, Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST counted 23 Nobel Prize winners amongst their former staff and students, with two further Nobel laureates being subsequently added. Manchester has traditionally been strong in the sciences; it is where the nuclear nature of the atom was discovered by Ernest Rutherford, and the world&#x27;s first electronic stored-program computer was built at the university. Notable scientists associated with the university include physicists Ernest Rutherford, Osborne Reynolds, Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Arthur Schuster, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and Balfour Stewart. Contributions in other fields such as mathematics were made by Paul Erdős, Horace Lamb and Alan Turing and in philosophy by Samuel Alexander, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Alasdair MacIntyre. The author Anthony Burgess, Pritzker Prize and RIBA Stirling Prize-winning architect Norman Foster and composer Peter Maxwell Davies all attended, or worked at, Manchester.

===Post-merger (2004 to present)===

The current University of Manchester was officially launched on 1 October 2004 when Queen Elizabeth II bestowed its royal charter. The university was named the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; University of the Year in 2006 after winning the inaugural &quot;Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; University of the Year prize in 2005.

The founding president and vice-chancellor of the new university was Alan Gilbert, former vice-chancellor of the University of Melbourne, who retired at the end of the 2009–2010 academic year. His successor was Dame Nancy Rothwell, who had held a chair in physiology at the university since 1994. Nancy served as Vice Chancellor from 2010 to 2024 before handing over to Duncan Ivison. The Nancy Rothwell Building was named in her honour. One of the university&#x27;s aims stated in the &quot;Manchester 2015 Agenda&quot; is to be one of the top 25 universities in the world, following on from Alan Gilbert&#x27;s aim to &quot;establish it by 2015 among the 25 strongest research universities in the world on commonly accepted criteria of research excellence and performance&quot;. In 2011, four Nobel laureates were on its staff: Andre Geim, Konstantin Novoselov, Sir John Sulston and Joseph E. Stiglitz.

The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) announced in February 2012 the formation of the National Graphene Institute. The University of Manchester is the &quot;single supplier invited to submit a proposal for funding the new £45m institute, £38m of which will be provided by the government&quot; – (EPSRC &amp; Technology Strategy Board). In 2013, an additional £23 million of funding from European Regional Development Fund was awarded to the institute taking investment to £61 million.

In August 2012, it was announced that the university&#x27;s Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences had been chosen to be the &quot;hub&quot; location for a new BP International Centre for Advanced Materials, as part of a $100 million initiative to create industry-changing materials. The centre will be aimed at advancing fundamental understanding and use of materials across a variety of oil and gas industrial applications and will be modelled on a hub and spoke structure, with the hub located at Manchester, and the spokes based at the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

In 2020 the university saw a series of student rent strikes and protests in opposition to the university&#x27;s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, rent levels and living conditions in the university&#x27;s halls of residence. The protests ended with a negotiated rent reduction.

In 2023, a second rent strike and student protest in opposition to the university&#x27;s rent price and living conditions in the halls of residence started. The protests included occupations, marches and student&#x27;s withholding their rent in University accommodation. The university&#x27;s response to the protests included using bailiffs to evict occupiers and taking disciplinary action against some occupiers. Despite outcry from the students - which included a referendum where 97% of students voted for the university to reduce rent prices, the following year the university continued to increase rent prices for its students. Some of the university-owned accommodation increased by up to 10% in rent price, compared to the previous year.

==Campus==
The university&#x27;s main site contains most of its facilities and is often referred to as the &quot;campus&quot;, however Manchester is not a campus university as the concept is commonly understood. It is centrally located in the city and its buildings are integrated into the fabric of Manchester, with non-university buildings and major roads between.

The campus comprises two parts:
*&quot;North campus&quot; or &quot;Sackville Street Campus&quot;, centred on Sackville Street in Manchester
*&quot;South campus&quot; or &quot;Oxford Road Campus&quot;, centred on Oxford Road
Student accommodation is located on three residential campuses: the City campus, adjacent to the academic departments; the Fallowfield campus approximately south of the main site; and the Victoria Park campus between the City and Fallowfields campuses.

===Old Quadrangle===

The buildings around the Old Quadrangle date from the time of Owens College, and were designed in a Gothic style by Alfred Waterhouse. The first to be built was the John Owens Building (1873), formerly the Main Building; the others were added over the next thirty years. These include the Beyer Building (1887), the Manchester Museum (1887), the Christie Library (1898) and Whitworth Hall (1902), which is used for the university&#x27;s graduations.

===Other notable buildings===
The University of Manchester estate includes over 30 listed buildings. Besides the buildings some the Old Quadrangle, other notable buildings on the Oxford Road Campus include the Stephen Joseph Studio, a former German Protestant church and the Samuel Alexander Building, a grade II listed building erected in 1919 and home of the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures.

Notable buildings on the Sackville Street Campus include the Sackville Street Building, formerly the UMIST Main Building, which was opened in 1902 by the then Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour. Built using Burmantofts terracotta, the building is now Grade II listed. It was extended along Whitworth Street, towards London Road, between 1927 and 1957 by the architects Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope, completion being delayed due to the depression in the 1930s and the Second World War.

===Cultural institutions===

The university&#x27;s Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire is a World Heritage Site and home to the 76-m Lovell Telescope. Other cultural institutions at the university include the John Rylands Research Institute and Library, the Whitworth art gallery and the Manchester Museum. The special collections at the John Rylands Library, and the entire collections at the Whitworth and the Manchester Museum are designated under the Arts Council England&#x27;s Designation Scheme as being among the &quot;pre-eminent collections held in museums, libraries and archives across England&quot;.

==Organisation and administration==

===Faculties and schools===
The University of Manchester is divided into three faculties: biology, medicine and health; science and engineering; and humanities.

====Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health====

The faculty is divided into the School of Biological Sciences, the School of Medical Sciences and the School of Health Sciences.

Biological sciences have been taught at Manchester as far back as the foundation of Owens College in 1851. At UMIST, biological teaching and research began in 1959, with the creation of a biochemistry department. The present school, though unitary for teaching, is divided into a number of sections for research purposes.

The medical college was established in 1874 and is one of the largest in the country, with more than 400 medical students trained in each clinical year and more than 350 students in the pre-clinical/phase 1 years. The university is a founding partner of the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, established to focus high-end healthcare research in Greater Manchester. In November 2018, Expertscape recognized it as one of the top ten institutions worldwide in COPD research and treatment.

In 1883, a department of pharmacy was established at the university and, in 1904, Manchester became the first British university to offer an honours degree in the subject. The School of Pharmacy benefits from links with Manchester Royal Infirmary and UHSM/ Wythenshawe and Salford Royal (formally known as Hope) hospitals providing its undergraduate students with hospital experience.

====Faculty of Science and Engineering====

The Faculty of Science and Engineering is divided into two schools. The School of Engineering comprises the departments of: chemical engineering and analytical science; computer science; electrical and electronic engineering; and mechanical, aerospace and civil engineering. The School of Natural Sciences comprises the departments of: chemistry; earth and environmental sciences; physics and astronomy; materials; and mathematics.

The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics comprises the university&#x27;s astronomical academic staff in Manchester and Jodrell Bank Observatory on rural land near Goostrey, about west of Macclesfield. The observatory&#x27;s Lovell Telescope is named after Sir Bernard Lovell, a professor at the Victoria University of Manchester who first proposed the telescope. Constructed in the 1950s, it is the third largest fully movable radio telescope in the world. It has played an important role in the research of quasars, pulsars and gravitational lenses, and in confirming Einstein&#x27;s theory of General Relativity.

====Faculty of Humanities====
The Faculty of Humanities is home to four schools:

* the School of Arts, Languages and Cultures (SALC), incorporating Archaeology; Art History &amp; Visual Studies; Classics and Ancient History; Drama; English and American Studies; History; Linguistics; Modern Languages; Museology; Music; Religions and Theology, and the University Language Centre.
* the School of Environment, Education and Development (SEED), incorporating Geography, Development, Planning, Property, Environmental Management, the Manchester Institute of Education, and the Manchester School of Architecture, which is administered in conjunction with Manchester Metropolitan University.
* the School of Social Sciences (SoSS), incorporating Law, Criminology, Economics, Politics, Sociology, Philosophy, Social Anthropology, and Social Statistics.
* Alliance Manchester Business School

Additionally, the faculty comprises a number of research institutes: the Centre for New Writing, the Institute for Social Change, the Brooks World Poverty Institute, Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute, the Manchester Institute for Innovation Research, the Research Institute for Cosmopolitan Cultures, the Centre for Chinese Studies, the Institute for Development Policy and Management, the Centre for Equity in Education and the Sustainable Consumption Institute.

===Professional services===
A number of professional services, organised as &quot;directorates&quot;, support the university. These include: Directorate of Compliance and Risk, Directorate of Estates and Facilities, Directorate of Finance, Directorate of Planning, Directorate of Human Resources, Directorate of IT Services, Directorate of Legal Affairs and Board Secretariat and Governance Office, Directorate of Research and Business Engagement, Directorate for the Student Experience, Division of Communications and Marketing, Division of Development and Alumni Relations, Office for Social Responsibility and the University Library. Additionally, professional services staff are found within the faculty structure, in such roles as technician and experimental officer.

Each directorate reports to the registrar, secretary and chief operating officer, who in turn reports to the president of the university. There is also a director of faculty operations in each faculty, overseeing support for these areas.

===Finances===
In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of Manchester had a total income of £1.365 billion (2022/23 – £1.346 billion) and total expenditure of £1.025 billion (2022/23 – £1.239 billion). Key sources of income included £714.3 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £659.9 million), £151.0 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £184.2 million), £287.9 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £271.1 million), 31.2 million from investment income (2022/23 – 17.4 million) and £8.3 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £18.6 million).

At year end, Manchester had endowments of £240.2 million (2023 – £221.6 million) and total net assets of £2.215 billion (2023 – £1.870 billion). It holds the seventh-largest endowment of any university in the UK.

==Academic profile==
The University of Manchester is the largest university in the UK (following The Open University and University College London). The University of Manchester attracts international students from 160 countries around the world.

Well-known members of the university&#x27;s current academic staff include computer scientist Steve Furber, economist Richard Nelson, novelist Jeanette Winterson, and 
Professor Brian Cox.

===Research===
The University of Manchester is a major centre for research and a member of the Russell Group of leading British research universities. In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and eighth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (tenth when including specialist institutions). In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the university was ranked fifth in the UK in terms of research power and fifteenth for grade point average quality of staff submitted among multi-faculty institutions (seventeenth when including specialist institutions). Manchester has the sixth largest research income of any English university (after Oxford, University College London (UCL), Cambridge, Imperial and King&#x27;s College London), and has been informally referred to as part of a &quot;golden diamond&quot; of research-intensive UK institutions (adding Manchester to the Oxford–Cambridge–London &quot;Golden Triangle&quot;). Manchester has a strong record in terms of securing funding from the three main UK research councils, EPSRC, Medical Research Council (MRC) and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), being ranked fifth, seventh and first respectively. In addition, the university is one of the richest in the UK in terms of income and interest from endowments: an estimate in 2008 placed it third, surpassed only by Oxford and Cambridge.

The University of Manchester has attracted the most research income from UK industry of any institution in the country. The figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), show that Manchester attracted £24,831,000 of research income in 2016–2017 from UK industry, commerce and public corporations.

Historically, Manchester has been linked with high scientific achievement: the university and its constituent former institutions combined had 25 Nobel laureates among their students and staff, the fourth largest number of any single university in the United Kingdom (after Oxford, Cambridge and UCL) and the ninth largest of any university in Europe. Furthermore, according to an academic poll two of the top ten discoveries by university academics and researchers were made at the university (namely the first working computer and the contraceptive pill). The university currently employs four Nobel Prize winners amongst its staff, more than any other in the UK. The Langworthy Professorship, an endowed chair at the university&#x27;s Department of Physics and Astronomy, has been historically given to a long line of academic luminaries, including Ernest Rutherford (1907–19), Lawrence Bragg (1919–37), Patrick Blackett (1937–53) and more recently Konstantin Novoselov, all of whom have won the Nobel Prize. In 2013 Manchester was given the Regius Professorship in Physics, the only one of its kind in the UK; the current holder is Andre Geim.

===Libraries===
The University of Manchester Library is the largest non-legal deposit library in the UK and the third-largest academic library after those of Oxford and Cambridge. It has the largest collection of electronic resources of any library in the UK.

The John Rylands Library, founded in memory of John Rylands by his wife Enriqueta Augustina Rylands as an independent institution, is situated in a Victorian Gothic building on Deansgate, in the city centre. It houses an important collection of historic books and other printed materials, manuscripts, including archives and papyri. The papyri are in ancient languages and include the oldest extant New Testament document, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, commonly known as the &quot;St John Fragment&quot;. In April 2007 the Deansgate site reopened to readers and the public after major improvements and renovations, including the construction of the pitched roof originally intended and a new wing.

===Collections===
====Manchester Museum====
The Manchester Museum holds nearly 4.25 million items sourced from many parts of the world. The collections include butterflies and carvings from India, birds and bark-cloth from the Pacific, live frogs and ancient pottery from America, fossils and native art from Australia, mammals and ancient Egyptian craftsmanship from Africa, plants, coins and minerals from Europe, art from past civilisations of the Mediterranean, and beetles, armour and archery from Asia. In November 2004, the museum acquired a cast of a fossilised &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; called &quot;Stan&quot;.

The museum&#x27;s first collections were assembled in 1821 by the Manchester Society of Natural History, and subsequently expanded by the addition of the collections of Manchester Geological Society. Due to the society&#x27;s financial difficulties and on the advice of evolutionary biologist Thomas Huxley, Owens College accepted responsibility for the collections in 1867. The college commissioned Alfred Waterhouse, architect of London&#x27;s Natural History Museum, to design a museum on a site in Oxford Road to house the collections for the benefit of students and the public. The Manchester Museum was opened to the public in 1888.

====Whitworth Art Gallery====
The Whitworth Art Gallery houses collections of internationally known British watercolours, textiles and wallpapers, modern and historic prints, drawings, paintings and sculpture. Its collection contains 31,000 items. A programme of temporary exhibitions runs throughout the year and the Mezzanine Court displays sculpture.

The gallery was founded by Robert Darbishire with a donation from Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1889, as &quot;The Whitworth Institute and Park&quot;. In 1959, the gallery became part of the Victoria University of Manchester. In October 1995, the Mezzanine Court in the centre of the building was opened. It was designed to display sculptures and won a RIBA regional award.

===Rankings and reputation===
According to the 2020 Graduate Market Review published by High Fliers, Manchester is the most targeted university by the top 100 graduate employers in the UK.

As of 2021, the University of Manchester has been recognised as the 27th best university in the world by QS. The university was ranked 6th nationally. The University of Manchester was ranked 36th in the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2020. It had the 5th highest ranking of UK universities on this list. In 2019, the university placed 4th nationally in Reuters&#x27; list of the World&#x27;s Most Innovative Universities.

According to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2006, &quot;Manchester has a formidable reputation spanning most disciplines, but most notably in the life sciences, engineering, humanities, economics, sociology and the social sciences&quot;. Manchester was given a prestigious award for Excellence and Innovation in the Arts by the &quot;Times Higher Education Awards 2010&quot;.

In 2017, the Alliance Manchester Business School was ranked 3rd in UK, 10th in Europe and 30th in the world by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in its global MBA ranking.

However, while world rankings (such as QS, ARWU, THE) typically place the university within the top 10 in the UK, the university ranks slightly less favourably in national studies. &#x27;The Complete University Guide 2022&#x27; ranked Manchester 13th out of universities in the UK, and ‘The Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide 2021&#x27; placed it at 18th. A 2016 poll voted Manchester as the third &quot;most underrated university in the UK&quot;.
In 2022, the University of Manchester was ranked at number 38 in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).

Deputy President and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Professor Luke Georgiou, said: “The ranking tables, despite their limitations, give a consistent picture of The University of Manchester’s excellence in national and global terms.”

===Admissions===
More students apply to Manchester than to any other university in the country, with 79,925 UCAS main scheme applications for undergraduate courses in 2020. Manchester had the 16th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2019, with new students averaging 165 UCAS points, equivalent to 3/8th of a grade below A*A*A* in A-level grades. The university gave offers of admission to 51.5% of its undergraduate applicants in 2022, the 16th lowest offer rate across the country.

15.7% of Manchester&#x27;s undergraduates are privately educated, the 23rd highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities. 49.9% of international students enrolled at the institution are from China, the fifth highest proportion out of all mainstream universities in the UK.

===Manchester University Press===

Manchester University Press is the university&#x27;s academic publishing house. It publishes academic monographs, textbooks and journals, most of which are works from authors based elsewhere in the international academic community, and is the third-largest university press in England after Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Union===

The University of Manchester Students&#x27; Union is the representative body of students at the university and the UK&#x27;s largest students&#x27; union. It was formed out of the merger between UMIST Students&#x27; Association and University of Manchester Union when the parent organisations UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester merged on 1 October 2004.

Unlike many other students&#x27; unions in the UK, it does not have a president, but is run by an eight-member executive team who share joint responsibility.

===Sport===

The University of Manchester operates sports clubs through its athletics union while student societies are operated by the Students&#x27; Union.

The university has more than 80 health and fitness classes while over 3,000 students are members of the 44 various Athletic Union clubs. The sports societies vary widely in their level and scope. Many more popular sports operate several university teams and departmental teams which compete in leagues against other teams within the university. Teams include: badminton, lacrosse, korfball, dodgeball, field hockey, rugby league, rugby union, football, basketball, fencing, netball, squash, water polo, ultimate, and cricket.

The athletic union was formed at Owens College in 1885 from four clubs: rugby, lacrosse, cricket and tennis. In 1901 the women&#x27;s athletic union was founded. In 1981 the two unions were amalgamated. After the acquisition of the Firs estate in Fallowfield a sports ground and pavilion were provided there. From 1940 the McDougall Centre in Burlington Street was also in use as a sports centre. Ron Hill, Rowena Sweatman, James Hickman, Cyril Holmes and Harry Whittle are former students who have achieved Olympic success.

The Manchester Aquatics Centre, the swimming pool used for the Manchester Commonwealth Games is on the campus and used for water sports. The main facilities used for sports are the Sugden Centre in Grosvenor Street, the Armitage Site near Owens Park and the Wythenshawe Sports Ground.

The university has achieved success in the BUCS (British University &amp; College Sports) competitions, with its men&#x27;s water polo 1st team winning the national championships (2009, 2010, 2011) under the tutelage of their coach Andy Howard. It was positioned in eighth place in the overall BUCS rankings for 2009/10.

The university competes annually in 28 different sports against Leeds and Liverpool universities in the Christie Cup, which Manchester has won for seven consecutive years. The Christie Cup is an inter-university competition between Liverpool, Leeds and Manchester in numerous sports since 1886. After the Oxford and Cambridge rivalry, the Christie&#x27;s Championships is the oldest Inter–University competition on the sporting calendar: the cup was a benefaction of Richard Copley Christie.

Every year elite sportsmen and sportswomen are selected for membership of the &quot;XXI Club&quot;, a society formed in 1932 to promote sporting excellence at the university. Most members have gained a Full Maroon for representing the university and many have excelled at a British Universities or National level. No more than 21 active members are allowed, each elected for up to three years (after graduating they become passive members).

An example of the university clubs is the lacrosse club which was founded in the season 1883–84 and in the following years won the North of England Flags twice and maintained its position among the leading English clubs. In 1885 it was one of the four founding clubs of the athletic union. The merging of Owens College with the university in 1904 affected the club by restricting the pool of players available for selection. However, when the English Universities Lacrosse Championship was set up in 1925–26 with five university teams the Manchester team won in the first season and again in 1932–33 and continued to do so in the 1930s.

===&quot;University Challenge&quot; quiz programme===
In the eight years up to 2013, Manchester has won the BBC2 quiz programme &quot;University Challenge&quot; four times, drawing equal with Magdalen College, Oxford, for the highest number of series wins. Since merging as the University of Manchester, the university has consistently reached the latter stages of the competition, progressing to at least the semi-finals in every appearance between 2005 and 2014.

In 2006, Manchester beat Trinity Hall, Cambridge, to record the university&#x27;s first win in the competition. The next year, the university finished in second place after losing to the University of Warwick in the final. In 2009, the team battled hard in the final against Corpus Christi College, Oxford. At the gong, the score was 275 to 190 in favour of Corpus Christi College after a winning performance from Gail Trimble. However, the title was eventually given to the University of Manchester after it was discovered that Corpus Christi team member Sam Kay had graduated eight months before the final was broadcast, so the team was disqualified.

Manchester reached the semi-finals in the 2010 competition before being beaten by Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The university did not enter the 2011 series for an unknown reason. However, Manchester did enter a year later and won University Challenge 2012. Manchester has since defended its title to win University Challenge 2013, beating University College London, 190 to 140.

===Student housing===

Before they merged, the two former universities had for some time been sharing their residential facilities.

====City Campus====

Whitworth Park Halls of Residence is owned by the University of Manchester and houses 1,085 students, located next to Whitworth Park. It is notable for its triangular shaped accommodation blocks. Their designer took inspiration from a hill created from excavated soil which had been left in 1962 from an archaeological dig led by John Gater. A consequence of the triangular design was a reduced cost for the construction company. A deal struck between the university and Manchester City Council meant the council would pay for the roofs of all student residential buildings in the area. They were built in the mid-1970s.
The site of the halls was previously occupied by many small streets whose names have been preserved in the names of the halls. Grove House is an older building that has been used by the university for many different purposes over the last sixty years. Its first occupants in 1951 were the Appointments Board and the Manchester University Press. The shops in Thorncliffe Place were part of the same plan and include banks and a convenience store.
Notable people associated with the halls include Friedrich Engels, whose residence is commemorated by a blue plaque on Aberdeen House; the physicist Brian Cox; and Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International.

The former UMIST Campus has four halls of residence near to Sackville Street building (Weston, Lambert, Fairfield, and Wright Robinson). The Grosvenor Halls of Residence were demolished in 2015 to make way for a new engineering campus. Chandos Hall, a former residence, has been closed and demolished.

Other residences include Vaughn House, once the home of the clergy serving the Church of the Holy Name, and George Kenyon Hall at University Place; Crawford House and Devonshire House adjacent to the Manchester Business School and Victoria Hall on Upper Brook Street.

====Victoria Park Campus====

The Victoria Park Campus has several halls of residence including St. Anselm Hall with Canterbury Court, Dalton-Ellis Hall, Hulme Hall (including Burkhardt House) and Opal Gardens Hall. Halls at Victoria Park are generally more traditional, and more likely to be catered.

Hulme Hall, which opened in 1887 in Plymouth Grove, is the oldest hall of residence at the university. It moved to its current site in Victoria Park in 1907.

====Fallowfield Campus====
The Fallowfield Campus, south of the Oxford Road Campus is the largest of the university&#x27;s residential campuses, built largely in the 1960s as a &#x27;Student Village&#x27;. The Owens Park group of halls with a landmark tower is at its centre, while Oak House is another hall of residence. Woolton Hall is next to Oak House. Allen Hall is a traditional hall near Ashburne Hall (Sheavyn House being annexed to Ashburne). Richmond Park is a recent addition to the campus, as well as Unsworth Park which opened in 2019.

==Notable people==

Many notable people have worked or studied at the University of Manchester, or its predecessor institutions, including 26 Nobel Prize laureates. Some of the best-known scientists are: John Dalton (founder of modern atomic theory), Ernest Rutherford who proved the nuclear nature of the atom whilst working at Manchester, Ludwig Wittgenstein (considered one of the most significant philosophers of the 20th century, who studied for a doctorate in engineering), George E. Davis (founder of the discipline of chemical engineering), Alan Turing (a founder of computer science and AI, and notable figure in gay rights history), Marie Stopes (pioneer of birth control and campaigner for women&#x27;s rights), Bernard Lovell (a pioneer of radio astronomy), Tom Kilburn and Frederic Calland Williams (who developed the Manchester Baby, the world&#x27;s first stored-program computer at Victoria University of Manchester in 1948), and physicist and television presenter Brian Cox.

Notable politicians and public figures associated with the university include: two current presidents - Michael D Higgins of the Republic of Ireland and Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania - and two current prime ministers - Abdalla Hamdok of Sudan and Gaston Browne of Antigua and Barbuda - as well as several ministers in the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Chaim Weizmann, a senior lecturer at the university, was the first president of Israel. Irene Khan is a former secretary general of Amnesty International.

In the arts, alumni include: the author Anthony Burgess and Robert Bolt (two times Academy Award winner and three times Golden Globe winner for writing the screenplay for &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;). A number of well-known actors have studied at the university, including Benedict Cumberbatch, who most notably portrays Doctor Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sherlock Holmes in the TV series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, as well as playing the role of Manchester&#x27;s own Alan Turing in the 2014 Oscar-winning biopic &quot;The Imitation Game.&quot; The university also educated some of the leading figures of alternative comedy: Ben Elton, Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall.

<text>The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was an informal organization, in the circle around the colleagues Herbert Van de Sompel, Carl Lagoze, Michael L. Nelson and Simeon Warner, to develop and apply technical interoperability standards for archives to share catalogue information (metadata). The group got together in the late late 1990s and was active for around twenty years. OAI coordinated in particular three specification activities: OAI-PMH, OAI-ORE and ResourceSync. All along the group worked towards building a &quot;low-barrier interoperability framework&quot; for archives (institutional repositories) containing digital content (digital libraries) to allow people (service providers) harvest metadata (from data providers). Such sets of metadata are since then harvested to provide &quot;value-added services&quot;, often by combining different data sets.

OAI has been involved in developing a technological framework and interoperability standards for enhancing access to eprint archives, which make scholarly communications like academic journals available, associated with the open access publishing movement. The relevant technology and standards are applicable beyond scholarly publishing.

The OAI technical infrastructure, specified in the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) version 2.0, defines a mechanism for data providers to expose their metadata. This protocol mandates that individual archives map their metadata to the Dublin Core, a common metadata set for this purpose. OAI standards allow a common way to provide content, and part of those standards is that the content has metadata that describes the items in Dublin Core format. Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) defines standards for the description and exchange of aggregations of web resources.

Funding for the initiative came from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Coalition for Networked Information (CNI), Digital Library Federation (DLF), National Science Foundation (NSF), the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and other organizations.

<doc id="83310" wikidata="Q6283446" url="?curid=83310" title="Sting operation">
<text>In law enforcement, a sting operation is a deceptive operation designed to catch a person attempting to commit a crime. A typical sting will have an undercover law enforcement officer, detective, or co-operative member of the public play a role as criminal partner or potential victim and go along with a suspect&#x27;s actions to gather evidence of the suspect&#x27;s wrongdoing. Mass media journalists occasionally resort to sting operations to record video and broadcast to expose criminal activity.

Sting operations are common in many countries, such as the United States, but they are not permitted in some countries, such as Sweden. There are prohibitions on conducting certain types of sting operations, such as in the Philippines, where it is illegal for law enforcers to pose as drug dealers to apprehend buyers of illegal drugs. In countries like France, Germany, and Italy, sting operations are relatively rare.

==Examples==

* Police in Columbus, Ohio, used a bait car outfitted with surveillance technology to catch three 15- and 17-year-old car thieves.
* In 2004, a joint operation between US, British and Australian police used fake websites - otherwise known as honeypots - to catch hackers and pedophiles.
* Wearing luxury timepieces to catch a watch thief. In late 2022, the London Met Police twice had officers pose as potential victims by wearing high-quality watches such as Rolex. According to them, there was a reduction in watch robberies as a result of the operations.
* A man was ordered released from prison by a US judge who criticized the Federal Bureau of Investigation for relying on an &quot;unsavory&quot; informant for a fake conspiracy to blow up a synagogue in New York City and shoot down planes belonging to the National Guard. The defendants, according to prosecutors, spent months scouting out targets and securing what they believed to be explosives and missiles. They were arrested after allegedly planting fake bombs that had been packed with FBI-supplied inert explosives.
* Luring fugitives out of hiding by sending them mail telling them that they have won a vacation or sports tickets in a competition, which can be collected. In a 1985 sting known as Operation Flagship, US Marshals arrested over 100 fugitives by posing as a television company inviting them to the Washington Convention Center to claim free tickets for a Washington Redskins match. Another established a fictitious airline offering free tickets, arresting those who came to the fake check-in desk at Miami International Airport. Such arrests are significantly safer than arresting the fugitive at their home, as the target will often be unarmed and off-guard.
* Arranging for someone under the legal drinking or smoking age to buy alcoholic beverages or tobacco products from a store, or to ask an adult to buy the products for them.
* Police from Belgium posed as a documentary film crew to lure a Somali pirate to the country where he was thought to have hijacked a Belgian-registered ship. He was arrested at Brussels Airport and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
* Canadian and American police coordinated a fake wedding for two undercover FBI agents, and the celebration was in fact an operation targeting an international smuggling and counterfeiting operation based out of China. A total of eight guests were stopped by local police en route to the event. Authorities said the defendants had been smuggling highly-realistic counterfeit American currency, bootleg cigarettes, drugs and illegal weapons.
* Posting a newspaper advertisement seeking a type of rare item known to have been stolen. In 1998, three agencies joined forces to conduct a sting operation where they successfully recovered the Honduras Goodwill Moon Rock from a vault in Miami. The sting operation was known as &quot;Operation Lunar Eclipse&quot; and the participating agencies were NASA Office of Inspector General, the United States Postal Inspection Service and U.S. Customs. The moon rock was offered to the undercover agents for  million. Journalist Christina Reed broke that story in Geotimes in 2002. Operation Lunar Eclipse and the Moon Rock Project were the subject of the book &quot;The Case of the Missing Moon Rocks&quot; by Joe Kloc.
* In 2021, David Ballantyne Smith, a security guard working at the British Embassy in Berlin was caught passing secret information to Russian authorities. The undercover operation was prompted by a letter he sent in 2020 to a military staff member at the Russian embassy in Berlin. Smith allegedly received money in exchange for secret information; there were unaccounted-for funds including €800 at his home in Potsdam. One undercover British operative posed as a &quot;walk-in&quot; Russian informant under the alias of Dmitry, when Smith escorted him into the building, after which Smith was seen on CCTV recording the earlier footage of Dmitry. A second undercover operative met him in the street and claimed to be a Russian intelligence officer named &quot;Irina&quot; who had been deployed to play the role of a GRU officer investigating whether Dmitry had been giving the UK information that had been potentially damaging to Russia. Smith, covertly recorded, told Irina that he needed to speak to &quot;someone&quot; (that someone being Dmitry) first before divulging any information.
* Posing as a minor on the internet, luring and catching online predators in the act.

<text>Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner (born 2 October 1951), known as Sting, is an English musician, activist and actor. He was the frontman, principal songwriter and bassist for new wave band the Police from 1977 until their breakup in 1986. He launched a solo career in 1985 and has included elements of rock, jazz, reggae, classical, new-age, and worldbeat in his music. 

Sting has sold a combined total of more than 100 million records as a solo artist and as a member of the Police. He has received three Brit Awards, including Best British Male Artist in 1994 and Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2002; a Golden Globe; an Emmy; and four Academy Award nominations. As a solo musician and as a member of the Police, Sting has received 17 Grammy Awards. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Police in 2003. Sting has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors; a CBE from Queen Elizabeth II for services to music; Kennedy Center Honors; and the Polar Music Prize. In May 2023, he was made an Ivor Novello Fellow.

==Early life==

Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner was born at Sir G B Hunter Memorial Hospital in Wallsend, Northumberland, England, on 2 October 1951, the eldest of four children of Audrey (née Cowell), a hairdresser, and Ernest Matthew Sumner, a milkman and former fitter at an engineering works. He grew up near Wallsend&#x27;s shipyards, which made an impression on him. As a child, he was inspired by the Queen Mother waving at him from a Rolls-Royce to divert from the shipyard prospect towards a more glamorous life. He helped his father deliver milk and by ten was &quot;obsessed&quot; with an old Spanish guitar left by an emigrating friend of his father.

Sting attended St Cuthbert&#x27;s Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne. He visited nightclubs such as Club A&#x27;Gogo to see Cream and Manfred Mann, who influenced his music. He learned to sing and play simultaneously by listening to records at 78 rpm. After leaving school in 1969, he enrolled at the University of Warwick in Coventry, but left after a term. After working as a bus conductor, building labourer, and tax officer, he attended the Northern Counties College of Education (now Northumbria University) from 1971 to 1974 and qualified as a teacher. He taught at St Paul&#x27;s First School in Cramlington for two years.

Sting performed jazz in the evenings, on weekends, and during breaks from college and teaching, playing with the Phoenix Jazzmen, Newcastle Big Band and Last Exit. He gained his nickname after his habit of wearing a black and yellow jumper with hooped stripes with the Phoenix Jazzmen. Bandleader Gordon Solomon thought he looked like a bee (or according to Sting himself, &quot;they thought I looked like a wasp&quot;), which prompted the name &quot;Sting&quot;. In the 1985 documentary &quot;Bring On the Night&quot; a journalist called him Gordon, to which he replied, &quot;My children call me Sting, my mother calls me Sting, who is this Gordon character?&quot; In 2011, he told &quot;Time&quot; that &quot;I was never called Gordon. You could shout &#x27;Gordon&#x27; in the street and I would just move out of your way&quot;. Despite this, he chose not to legally change his name to &quot;Sting&quot;.

==Musical career==
===1977–1984: The Police and early solo work===

In January 1977, Sting joined Stewart Copeland and Henry Padovani (soon replaced by Andy Summers) to form the Police, becoming the band&#x27;s lead singer, bass player, and primary songwriter. From 1978 to 1983, the Police had five UK chart-topping albums, won six Grammy Awards and won two Brit Awards (for Best British Group and for Outstanding Contribution to Music). Their initial sound was punk-inspired, but they switched to reggae rock and minimalist pop. Their final album, &quot;Synchronicity&quot;, was nominated for five Grammy Awards including Album of the Year in 1983. It included their most successful song, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, written by Sting.

According to Sting, appearing in the documentary &quot;Last Play at Shea&quot;, he decided to leave the Police while onstage during a concert of 18 August 1983 at Shea Stadium in New York City because he felt that playing that venue was &quot;[Mount] Everest&quot;. While never formally breaking up, after &quot;Synchronicity&quot;, the group agreed to concentrate on solo projects. As the years went by, the band members, especially Sting, dismissed the possibility of reforming. In 2007, however, the band did reform temporarily for the purpose of undertaking a reunion tour.

Four of the band&#x27;s five studio albums appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and two of the band&#x27;s songs, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot;, each written by Sting, appeared on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In addition, &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot; were among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In 2003, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were also included in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; and VH1&#x27;s lists of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.

In 1978, Sting collaborated with members of Hawkwind and Gong as the Radio Actors on the one-off single &quot;Nuclear Waste&quot;. In September 1981, Sting made his first live solo appearance, on all four nights of the fourth Amnesty International benefit The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball in London&#x27;s Drury Lane theatre at the invitation of producer Martin Lewis. He performed solo versions of &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;. He also led an all-star band (dubbed &quot;the Secret Police&quot;) on his own arrangement of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;. The band and chorus included Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Robin Gibb, Cliff Richard, Phil Collins, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, all of whom (except Beck and Gibb) later performed at Live Aid. His performances were in the album and movie of the show. &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot; began his growing involvement in political and social causes. In 1982 he released a solo single, &quot;Spread a Little Happiness&quot; from the film of the Dennis Potter television play &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot;. The song was a reinterpretation of the 1920s musical &quot;Mr. Cinders&quot; by Vivian Ellis and a Top 20 hit in the UK.

===1985–1989: Solo debut===

His first solo album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of the Blue Turtles&quot;, featured jazz musicians including Kenny Kirkland, Darryl Jones, Omar Hakim and Branford Marsalis. It included the hit singles &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot; (backed with the non-LP song &quot;Another Day&quot;), &quot;Fortress Around Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Love Is the Seventh Wave&quot; and &quot;Russians&quot;, the latter of which was based on a theme from the &quot;Lieutenant Kijé Suite&quot;. Within a year, the album reached Triple Platinum. The album received Grammy nominations for Album of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Jazz Instrumental Performance and Best Engineered Recording.

In November 1984, Sting was part of Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, which raised money for famine victims in Ethiopia. Released in June 1985, Sting sang the line &quot;I Want My MTV&quot; on &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; by Dire Straits. In July 1985, Sting performed Police hits at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London. He also joined Dire Straits in &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; and he sang two duets with Phil Collins. In 1985, Sting provided spoken vocals for the Miles Davis album &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot;, taking the role of a French-speaking police officer. He also sang backing vocals on Arcadia&#x27;s single &quot;The Promise&quot;, on two songs from Phil Collins&#x27; album &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, and contributed &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; to the Hal Willner-produced tribute album &quot;Lost in the Stars: The Music of Kurt Weill&quot;. In September 1985, he performed &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot; at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards at the Radio City Music Hall in New York. The 1985 film &quot;Bring On the Night&quot;, directed by Michael Apted, documented the formation of his solo band and its first concert in France.

Sting released &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun&quot; in 1987, including singles, &quot;We&#x27;ll Be Together&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;Englishman in New York&quot; and &quot;Be Still My Beating Heart&quot;, dedicated to his mother, who had recently died. It went Double Platinum. &quot;The Secret Marriage&quot; from this album was adapted from Hanns Eisler and &quot;Englishman in New York&quot; was about Quentin Crisp. The album&#x27;s title is from William Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnet 130. The album won Best British Album at the 1988 Brit Awards and in 1989 received three Grammy nominations including his second consecutive nomination for Album of the Year. &quot;Be Still My Beating Heart&quot; earned nominations for Song of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance. In 1989, &quot;...Nothing Like the Sun&quot; was ranked number 90 and his Police album &quot;Synchronicity&quot; was ranked number 17 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 100 greatest albums of the 1980s.

In February 1988, he made &quot;Nada como el sol&quot;, four songs from &quot;Nothing like the Sun&quot; he sang in Spanish and Portuguese. In 1987, jazz arranger Gil Evans placed him in a big band setting for a live album of Sting&#x27;s songs, and on Frank Zappa&#x27;s 1988 &quot;Broadway the Hard Way&quot; he performed an arrangement of &quot;Murder by Numbers&quot;, set to &quot;Stolen Moments&quot; by Oliver Nelson and dedicated to evangelist Jimmy Swaggart. In October 1988 he recorded a version of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot; with the London Sinfonietta conducted by Kent Nagano. It featured Vanessa Redgrave, Ian McKellen, Gianna Nannini and Sting as the soldier.

===1990–1997: Greater solo success===
His 1991 album, &quot;The Soul Cages&quot;, was dedicated to his late father. It included &quot;All This Time&quot; and the Grammy-winning title track. The album, which went platinum, included an Italian version of &quot;Mad About You&quot;. Also in 1991, he appeared on &quot;Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John and Bernie Taupin&quot;. He performed &quot;Come Down in Time&quot; for the album, which also features other popular artists and their renditions of John/Taupin songs. 

Sting&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Ten Summoner&#x27;s Tales&quot;, peaked at two in the UK and US album charts in 1993 and went triple platinum in just over a year. The album was recorded at his Elizabethan country home, Lake House in Wiltshire. &quot;Ten Summoner&#x27;s Tales&quot; was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 1993 and for the Grammy for Album of the Year in 1994. The title is a wordplay on his surname, Sumner and &quot;The Summoner&#x27;s Tale&quot;, one of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer. Hit singles on the album include &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;, a song inspired by the barley fields next to his Wiltshire home, with the music video featuring a silhouette of Sting walking through a village containing common features seen throughout the UK during that time such as a red telephone box and &quot;If I Ever Lose My Faith in You&quot;, the latter earning his second award for best male pop singer at the 36th Grammy Awards.

In May 1993, he covered his own Police song from the &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; album, &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, for the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; film. With Bryan Adams and Rod Stewart, Sting performed &quot;All for Love&quot; for the film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. The song stayed at the top of the U.S. charts for three weeks, topped multiple other charts worldwide and reached number two in the UK. In February, he won two Grammy Awards and was nominated for three more. Berklee College of Music awarded him his second honorary doctorate of music in May. In November, he released the compilation, &quot;Fields of Gold: The Best of Sting&quot;, which was certified Double Platinum. That year, he sang with Vanessa Williams on &quot;Sister Moon&quot; and appeared on her album &quot;The Sweetest Days&quot;. At the 1994 Brit Awards in London, he was Best British Male.

Sting&#x27;s 1996 album, &quot;Mercury Falling&quot;, debuted strongly, with the single &quot;Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot&quot; reaching number 15 in the UK Singles Chart, but the album soon dropped from the charts. He reached the UK Top 40 with two further singles the same year with &quot;You Still Touch Me&quot; (number 27 in June) and &quot;I Was Brought To My Senses&quot; (number 31 in December). The song &quot;I&#x27;m So Happy I Can&#x27;t Stop Crying&quot; from this album also became a US country music hit in 1997 in a version with Toby Keith. Sting recorded music for the Disney film &quot;Kingdom of the Sun&quot;, which was reworked into &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot;. The film&#x27;s overhauls and plot changes were documented by Sting&#x27;s wife, Trudie Styler, as the changes resulted in some songs not being used.

On 4 September 1997, Sting performed &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot; with Puff Daddy at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards in tribute to Notorious B.I.G. On 15 September 1997, Sting appeared at the &quot;Music for Montserrat&quot; concert at the Royal Albert Hall, London, performing with fellow English artists Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and Mark Knopfler.

===1998–2005: &quot;Brand New Day&quot; and soundtrack work===

A period of relative musical inactivity followed from 1997, before Sting eventually re-emerged in September 1999, with a new album &quot;Brand New Day&quot;, which gave him two more UK Top 20 hits in the title track &quot;Brand New Day&quot; (a UK number 13 hit featuring Stevie Wonder on harmonica) and &quot;Desert Rose&quot; (a UK number 15 hit). The album went Triple Platinum by January 2001. In 2000, he won Grammy Awards for &quot;Brand New Day&quot; and the song of the same name. At the awards ceremony, he performed &quot;Desert Rose&quot; with his collaborator on the album version, Cheb Mami.

In 2000, the soundtrack for &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Groove&quot; was released with complete songs from the previous version of the film. The final single used to promote the film, &quot;My Funny Friend and Me&quot;, was Sting&#x27;s first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Song.

In February 2001, he won another Grammy for &quot;She Walks This Earth (Soberana Rosa)&quot; on &quot;A Love Affair: The Music Of Ivan Lins&quot;. His &quot;After the Rain Has Fallen&quot; made it into the Top 40. His next project was a live album at his villa in Figline Valdarno, released as a CD and DVD as well as being broadcast on the internet. The CD and DVD were to be entitled &quot;On Such a Night&quot; and intended to feature re-workings of Sting favourites such as &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot;. The concert, scheduled for 11 September 2001, was altered due to the terrorist attacks in America that day. The webcast shut after one song (a reworked version of &quot;Fragile&quot;), after which Sting let the audience decide whether to continue the show. They decided to go ahead and the album and DVD appeared in November as &quot;...All This Time&quot;, dedicated &quot;to all those who lost their lives on that day&quot;. He performed &quot;Fragile&quot; with Yo-Yo Ma and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir during the opening ceremonies of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, US.

In 2002, he won a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Until...&quot; from the film &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot;. Written and performed by him, &quot;Until...&quot; was his second nomination for an Academy Award for Best Song. At the 2002 Brit Awards in February, Sting received the prize for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In May 2002 he received the Ivor Novello Award for Lifetime Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours 2003 Sting was made a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire &quot;For services to the Music Industry&quot;. At the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards in September, Sting won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety Or Music Program, for his A&amp;E special, &quot;Sting in Tuscany... All This Time&quot;.

In 2003, Sting released &quot;Sacred Love&quot;, a studio album featuring collaborations with hip-hop artist Mary J. Blige and sitar performer Anoushka Shankar. He and Blige won a Grammy for their duet, &quot;Whenever I Say Your Name&quot;. The song is based on Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Praeambulum 1&quot; C-Major (BWV 924) from the Klavierbuechlein fuer Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, though Sting said little about this adaptation. In 2004, he was nominated for the third time for an Academy Award for Best Song, for &quot;You Will Be My Ain True Love&quot;, from &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, sung in duet with Alison Krauss. The pair performed the song at the 76th Academy Awards.

His autobiography &quot;Broken Music&quot; was published in October. He embarked on a &quot;Sacred Love&quot; tour in 2004 with performances by Annie Lennox. Sting went on the Broken Music tour, touring smaller venues, with a four-piece band, starting in Los Angeles on 28 March 2005 and ending on 14 May 2005. Sting was on the 2005 &quot;Monkey Business&quot; CD by hip-hop group the Black Eyed Peas, singing on &quot;Union&quot;, which samples his &quot;Englishman in New York&quot;. Continuing with Live Aid, he appeared at Live 8 at Hyde Park, London in July 2005.

===2006–2010: Experimental albums and the Police reunion===

In 2006, Sting was on the Gregg Kofi Brown album, with &quot;Lullaby to an Anxious Child&quot; produced and arranged by Lino Nicolosi and Pino Nicolosi of Nicolosi Productions.

In October 2006, he released an album entitled &quot;Songs from the Labyrinth&quot; featuring the music of John Dowland (an Elizabethan-era composer) and accompaniment from Bosnian lute player Edin Karamazov. Sting&#x27;s interpretation of this English Renaissance composer and his cooperation with Edin Karamazov brought recognition in classical music. As promotion of this album, he appeared on the fifth episode of &quot;Studio 60&quot; to perform a segment of Dowland&#x27;s &quot;Come Again&quot; as well as his own &quot;Fields of Gold&quot; in arrangement for voice and two archlutes.

On 11 February 2007, he reunited with Police to open the 2007 Grammy Awards, singing &quot;Roxanne&quot;, and announced a reunion tour, the first concert of which was in Vancouver on 28 May 2007 for 22,000 fans. The Police toured for more than a year, beginning with North America and crossing to Europe, South America, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Tickets for the British tour sold out within 30 minutes, the band playing two nights at Twickenham Stadium, southwest London on 8 and 9 September 2007. The last concert was at Madison Square Garden on 7 August 2008, during which his three daughters appeared with him. 

&quot;Brand New Day&quot; was the final song of the night for the &quot;Neighborhood Ball&quot;, one of ten inaugural balls honouring President Barack Obama on Inauguration Day, 20 January 2009. Sting was joined by Stevie Wonder on harmonica.

Sting entered the studio in early February 2009 to begin work on a new album, &quot;If on a Winter&#x27;s Night...&quot;, released in October 2009. Initial reviews by fans that had access to early promotional copies were mixed, and some questioned Sting&#x27;s artistic direction with this album. In 2009, Sting appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th anniversary concert, playing &quot;Higher Ground&quot; and &quot;Roxanne&quot; with Stevie Wonder and &quot;People Get Ready&quot; with Jeff Beck. Sting himself was inducted in 2003, as a member of the Police.

In October 2009, Sting played a concert in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for an arts and cultural festival organised by the Forum of Culture and Arts of Uzbekistan Foundation. Despite claiming he thought the concert was sponsored by UNICEF, he faced criticism in the press for receiving a payment of between one and two million pounds from Uzbek president Islam Karimov for the performance. Karimov is accused by the UN and Amnesty of human rights abuses and UNICEF stated they had no connection with the event.

===2010–2016: &quot;The Last Ship&quot; and joint tours with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel===

In 2010–2011, Sting continued his Symphonicity Tour, touring South Korea, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South America and Europe. In the second half of 2011, Sting began his Back to Bass Tour, which would continue (with periodic breaks) through 2013. In October 2010, Sting played two concerts in Arnhem, Netherlands, for &quot;Symphonica in Rosso&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Sting one of the 100 most influential people in the world. On 26 April he performed &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Desert Rose&quot; at the Time 100 Gala in New York City.

Sting recorded a song called &quot;Power&#x27;s Out&quot; with Nicole Scherzinger. The song, originally recorded in 2007, was to have been included on Scherzinger&#x27;s shelved album, &quot;Her Name is Nicole&quot;. The song was released on Scherzinger&#x27;s 2011 debut album, &quot;Killer Love&quot;. Sting recorded a new version of the song &quot;Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot&quot; as a duet with &quot;Glee&quot; actor/singer Matthew Morrison, which appears on Morrison&#x27;s 2011 eponymous debut album. On 15 September 2011, Sting performed &quot;Fragile&quot; at the 92nd Street Y in New York City, to honour the memory of his friend, financier-philanthropist Herman Sandler, who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.

For several years, Sting worked on a musical, &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, inspired by Sting&#x27;s own childhood experiences and the shipbuilding industry in Wallsend. &quot;The Last Ship&quot; tells a story about the demise of the British shipbuilding industry in 1980s Newcastle and debuted in Chicago in June 2014 before transferring to Broadway in the autumn. Sting&#x27;s eleventh studio album, titled &quot;The Last Ship&quot;, and inspired by the play, was released on 24 September 2013. The album features guest artists with roots in northeast England, including Brian Johnson, vocalist from AC/DC.

In February 2014, Sting embarked on a joint concert tour titled On Stage Together with Paul Simon, playing 21 concerts in North America. The tour continued in early 2015, with ten shows in Australia and New Zealand, and 23 concerts in Europe, ending on 18 April 2015. On 26 June 2015 in Bergen, Norway (at the Bergen Calling Festival), Sting embarked on a 21-date Summer 2015 solo tour of Europe in Trondheim, Norway (at the Olavsfestdagene), visiting Denmark, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Sweden.

On 28 August 2015, &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, a duet with French singer Mylène Farmer was released. It is a cover from Sting&#x27;s 2003 seventh solo studio album, &quot;Sacred Love&quot;, and will serve as the first single from Farmer&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Interstellaires&quot;. On its release, the song went straight to number one over French iTunes music download charts, subsequently hitting number one on the main French singles chart and giving Sting his first number one in France. In 2016, Sting performed a 19-date joint concert summer tour of North America with Peter Gabriel.

===2016–2020: &quot;57th &amp; 9th&quot;, &quot;44/876&quot; and &quot;My Songs&quot;===
On 18 July 2016, Sting&#x27;s first rock album in many years was announced. &quot;57th &amp; 9th&quot; was released on 11 November 2016. The title is a reference to the New York City intersection he crossed every day to get to the studio where much of the album was recorded. It has contributions by long-time band members Vinnie Colaiuta and Dominic Miller, and Jerry Fuentes and Diego Navaira of the Last Bandoleros. The album was produced by Sting&#x27;s manager, Martin Kierszenbaum. On 9 November 2016, Sting performed two shows at Irving Plaza, in Manhattan, New York City, playing songs from &quot;57th &amp; 9th&quot; for the first time live in concert: a &quot;57th &amp; 9th iHeartRadio Album Release Party&quot; show and a Sting Fan Club Member Exclusive Show later that night. Named the 57th &amp; 9th Tour, a world tour of theatres, clubs and arenas in support of &quot;57th &amp; 9th&quot; (with special guests Joe Sumner and the Last Bandoleros) began on 1 February 2017 in Vancouver at the Commodore Ballroom and continued into October.
On 4 November 2016, management of the Bataclan theatre announced that Sting would perform an exclusive concert in Paris on 12 November 2016 for the re-opening of the Bataclan, a year after the terrorist attack at the venue. The Police&#x27;s former guitar player, French native Henry Padovani, joined the band on stage for &quot;Next to You&quot;, one of the encores.

Sting was announced as the joint winner of the 2017 Polar Music Prize, a Swedish international award given in recognition of excellence in the world of music. The award committee stated: &quot;As a composer, Sting has combined classic pop with virtuoso musicianship and an openness to all genres and sounds from around the world.&quot; In 2018, he scheduled a musical and story-telling performance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art honouring Hudson River School artist Thomas Cole.
On 7 February 2018, Sting performed as special guest at the Italian Sanremo Music Festival, singing &quot;Muoio per te&quot;, the Italian version of &quot;Mad About You&quot;, the lyrics of which were written by his friend and colleague Zucchero Fornaciari and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Wait&quot; with Shaggy. &quot;44/876&quot;, Sting and Shaggy&#x27;s first studio album as a duo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sting Shaggy 44/876&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was released in April 2018. On 21 April 2018, Sting was among the artists to perform at The Queen&#x27;s Birthday Party held at the Royal Albert Hall. In 2019, he received a BMI Award when &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, a hit single by the Police, became the most-played song in radio history. 

Sting&#x27;s fourteenth album, titled &quot;My Songs&quot;, was released on 24 May 2019. The album features 14 studio (and one live) re-recorded versions of his songs released throughout his solo career and his time with the Police. In support of the album, a world tour named the My Songs Tour started on 28 May 2019 at La Seine Musicale in Paris and ended on 2 September 2019 at Kit Carson Park in Taos, New Mexico. A 16-date residency from 22 May to 2 September 2020 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada was rescheduled due to COVID-19, with the first date taking place on 29 October 2021. His six nights at the London Palladium were rescheduled to April 2022.

On 14 April 2020, Sting recorded a duet cover of &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; with the girl group All Saints. The same year, he appeared on the song &quot;Simple&quot; available on the EP &quot;Pausa&quot; by Ricky Martin. Also in 2020, Sting was listed as number 32 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the top 50 greatest bassists of all time.

===2021–present: &quot;Duets&quot; and &quot;The Bridge&quot;===
On 19 March 2021, Sting released &quot;Duets&quot;, a compilation album comprising 17 tracks of collaborations with various artists including Eric Clapton, Mary J. Blige, Shaggy, Annie Lennox and Sam Moore. 

Sting released his fifteenth studio album, &quot;The Bridge&quot;, on 19 November 2021. It was preceded by the release of the lead single &quot;If It&#x27;s Love&quot; on 1 September 2021. Sting wrote the set of pop-rock songs &quot;in a year of global pandemic, personal loss, separation, disruption, lockdown and extraordinary social and political turmoil&quot;. On 20 November 2021, Sting&#x27;s single &quot;What Could Have Been&quot;, with Ray Chen, was featured in the third act of the &quot;League of Legends&quot; animated series &quot;Arcane&quot;; this single was released the same day. Sting then opened The Game Awards 2021 with the song; Todd Marten, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote &quot;The Game Awards began this year with an opening that might have launched the Grammy Awards&quot;.

In February 2022, Sting collaborated with Swedish DJ supergroup Swedish House Mafia, releasing a song and music video titled &quot;Redlight&quot;. The song used lyrics from the Police&#x27;s 1979 hit &quot;Roxanne&quot; with a dark electronic feeling. Sting made an appearance in the music video, the song being part of the new album from Swedish House Mafia titled &quot;Paradise Again&quot;. In February 2022, it was announced that Universal Music Group purchased Sting&#x27;s catalogue of solo works and those with the Police for an undisclosed amount. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him as the highest-paid solo musician of 2022, with an estimated earnings of $210 million.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Sting gave a private performance on 17 January 2023 for fifty top Microsoft executives at the 2023 World Economic Forum at Davos. The next day Microsoft announced plans to lay off 10,000 people in what some employees called &quot;as a bad look&quot; for the company. &quot;Some employees thought it wasn&#x27;t the right time for a company-sponsored Sting concert,&quot; wrote Tom Dotan and Sam Schechner. &quot;The theme of the event was sustainability.&quot; The event quickly went viral.

==Activism==

Sting&#x27;s involvement in human rights began in September 1981, when Martin Lewis included him in the fourth Amnesty International gala, &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;, a benefit show co-founded by Monty Python member John Cleese. Sting states, &quot;before [the Ball] I did not know about Amnesty, I did not know about its work, I did not know about torture in the world.&quot; Following the example set at the 1979 show by Pete Townshend, Sting performed &quot;Roxanne&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; appearing on all four nights at Theatre Royal in London. He also led other musicians (&quot;The Secret Police&quot;) including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Phil Collins, Donovan, Bob Geldof and Midge Ure in the finale – Sting&#x27;s reggae-tinged arrangement of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;. The event was the first time that Sting worked with Geldof. His association with Amnesty continued throughout the 1980s and beyond and he took part in Amnesty&#x27;s human rights concerts.

Sting had shown his interest in social and political issues in his 1980 song &quot;Driven to Tears&quot;, an indictment of apathy to world hunger. In November 1984, he joined Band Aid, a charity supergroup primarily made up of the biggest British and Irish musicians of the era, and sang on &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; which was recorded at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London. This led to the Live Aid concert in July 1985 at Wembley Stadium, in which Sting performed with Phil Collins and Dire Straits. On 2 July 2005, Sting performed at the Live 8 concert at Hyde Park, London, the follow-up to 1985&#x27;s Live Aid. In 1984, Sting sang a re-worded version of &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, titled &quot;Every Bomb You Make&quot; for episode 12 of the first series of the British satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. The video for the song shows the puppets of world leaders and political figures of the day, usually with the figure matching the altered lyrics.

In June 1986, Sting reunited with the Police for the last three shows of Amnesty&#x27;s six-date A Conspiracy of Hope concerts in the US. The day after the final concert, he told NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve been a member of Amnesty and a support member for five years.&quot; In 1988, he joined musicians including Peter Gabriel and Bruce Springsteen for a six-week Human Rights Now! tour commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

With his wife, Trudie Styler and Raoni Metuktire, a Kayapo Indian leader in Brazil, Sting founded the Rainforest Foundation Fund to help save the rainforests and protect indigenous peoples there. In 1989, he flew to the Altamira Gathering to offer support while promoting his charity. His support continues and includes an annual benefit concert at Carnegie Hall, which has featured Billy Joel, Elton John, James Taylor and others. A species of Colombian tree frog, &quot;Dendropsophus stingi&quot;, was named after him for his &quot;commitment and efforts to save the rainforest&quot;. In 1988, the single &quot;They Dance Alone (Cueca Sola)&quot; chronicled the plight of the mothers, wives and daughters of the &quot;disappeared&quot;, political opponents killed by the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile.
On 15 September 1997, Sting joined Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Phil Collins and Mark Knopfler at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall for Music for Montserrat, a benefit for the Caribbean island devastated by a volcano. Sting and Styler were awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award in Sherborn, Massachusetts, on 30 June 2000. In September 2001, Sting took part in &quot;&quot; singing &quot;Fragile&quot; to raise money for families of victims of the 9/11 attacks in the US. In February 2005, Sting performed the Leeuwin Estate Concert Series in Western Australia: the concert raised $4 million for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami relief.

In 2007, Sting joined Andy Summers and Stewart Copeland for the closing set at the Live Earth concert at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Joined by John Mayer and Kanye West, Sting and the Police ended the show singing &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; In 2008 Sting contributed to &quot;Songs for Tibet&quot; to support Tibet and the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso. On 22 January 2010, Sting performed &quot;Driven to Tears&quot; during &quot;Hope for Haiti Now&quot;. On 25 April 2010, he performed on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in the 40th anniversary celebration of Earth Day. Sting is a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. 

In 2011, Sting joined more than 30 others in an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron for &quot;immediate decriminalisation of drug possession&quot; if a policy review showed it had failed. Sting was quoted: &quot;Giving young people criminal records for minor drug possession serves little purpose — it is time to think of more imaginative ways of addressing drug use in our society.&quot;

On 4 July 2011, Sting cancelled a concert for the Astana Day Festival in Astana, Kazakhstan. Amnesty International convinced him to cancel due to concerns over the rights of Kazakh oil and gas workers and their families. On 2 November 2012, Sting appeared on &quot;Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together&quot; and sang a version of &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; to raise funds for those affected by a storm on the east coast of the US that week. The show reportedly raised $23 million. Sting also participated as a co-host and musician during the day-long 2015 Norwegian TV campaign, dedicated to the preservation of the rainforest.

In August 2014, Sting was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to reject Scottish independence from the UK in September&#x27;s referendum on the issue.

Sting publicly opposed Brexit and supported remaining in the European Union. On 23 June 2016, in a referendum, the British public voted to leave. In October 2018, Sting was among a group of British musicians who signed an open letter sent to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof, calling for &quot;a 2nd vote&quot;, stating that Brexit will &quot;impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation&quot;, the letter added: &quot;We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and, in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.&quot;

In January 2018, it was reported that Sting had joined the board of advisors of an impact investing fund of JANA Partners LLC named JANA Impact Capital, aimed at serving environmental and social causes. On 6 January 2018, JANA Partners, together with the California State Teachers&#x27; Retirement System issued a public letter imploring Apple Inc. to take a more responsible approach towards smartphone addiction among children. The letter cited several pieces of evidence that show that smartphone use by children increases the risk of their having mental health problems and worsens academic performance.

==Personal life==
Sting married actress Frances Tomelty on 1 May 1976. They had two children: Joseph (b. 23 November 1976), and Fuschia Katherine &quot;Kate&quot; (b. 17 April 1982) Sumner. In 1980, Sting became a tax exile in Galway, Ireland. In 1982, after the birth of his second child, he separated from Tomelty. Tomelty and Sting divorced in 1984 following Sting&#x27;s affair with actress Trudie Styler. The split was controversial; as &quot;The Independent&quot; reported in 2006, Tomelty &quot;just happened to be Trudie&#x27;s best friend (Sting and Frances lived next door to Trudie in Bayswater, west London, for several years before the two of them became lovers)&quot;.

Sting married Styler at Camden Registry Office on 20 August 1992, and the couple had their wedding blessed two days later in the twelfth-century parish church of St Andrew in Great Durnford, Wiltshire, south-west England. Sting and Styler have four children, three of whom were born before their marriage: Brigitte Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; (b. 19 January 1984), Jake (b. 24 May 1985), Eliot Paulina &quot;Coco&quot; (b. 30 July 1990), and Giacomo Luke (b. 17 December 1995) Sumner. Coco is founder and lead singer of the group I Blame Coco. Giacomo Luke is the inspiration behind the name of Kentucky Derby-winning horse Giacomo.

In April 2009, the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; estimated Sting&#x27;s wealth at £175million and ranked him the 322nd wealthiest person in Britain. A decade later, Sting was estimated to have a fortune of £320million in the 2019 &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot;, making him one of the ten wealthiest people in the British music industry.

Both of Sting&#x27;s parents died of cancer: his mother in 1986 and his father in 1987. He did not attend either funeral, in order not to draw media attention to them.

In 1989, a western film written specifically for Sting was organized by his own and former Police video director Lol Creme. Sting&#x27;s manager at the time Miles Copeland became involved, and the project was later passed to director Ridley Scott, but was never undertaken from there.

In 1995, Sting gave evidence in court against his former accountant (Keith Moore), who had misappropriated £6 million of his money. Moore was jailed for six years. Sting owns several homes worldwide, including Lake House and its sixty-acre estate near Salisbury, Wiltshire; a penthouse at 220 Central Park South in New York City; and the Villa Il Palagio estate in Figline Valdarno, Tuscany. He owned a house in Highgate, 2 The Grove for a number of years, which had previously been the home of violinist Yehudi Menuhin.

For much of his life, Sting&#x27;s spare time interests and activities have revolved around mental and physical fitness. For many years, he ran five miles (8 km) a day and also performed aerobics. He participated in running races at Parliament Hill and charity runs (including the Race Against Time for Sport Aid in both 1986 and 1988). Around 1990, Danny Paradise introduced him to yoga and he began practising the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga series, though he now practises Tantra and Jivamukti Yoga as well. He wrote a foreword to &quot;Yoga Beyond Belief&quot;, written by Ganga White in 2007. In 2008, he was reported to practise Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s Transcendental Meditation technique. He also practises pilates regularly.
Also a keen chess player, Sting played chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in an exhibition game in 2000, along with four bandmates: Dominic Miller, Jason Rebello, Chris Botti and Russ Irwin. Kasparov beat all five simultaneously within fifty minutes.

In 1969, Sting read the Gormenghast trilogy by Mervyn Peake and later bought the film rights. He named pets, a racehorse, his publishing company and one of his daughters (Fuschia, in the books actually Fuchsia) after characters from the books.

Sting supports his hometown Premier League football club Newcastle United and in 2009 backed a supporters&#x27; campaign against the plan of owner Mike Ashley to sell off naming rights of the club&#x27;s home stadium St James&#x27; Park. He wrote a song in support of Newcastle, called &quot;Black and White Army (Bringing The Pride Back Home)&quot;.

In a 2011 interview in &quot;Time&quot;, Sting said that he was agnostic and that the certainties of religious faith were dangerous.

In August 2014, Sting donated money to The Friends of Tynemouth Outdoor Pool to regenerate the 1920s lido at the southern end of Longsands Beach in Tynemouth, northeast England, a few miles from where he was born.

Sting follows a macrobiotic diet, meaning that he avoids processed foods.
