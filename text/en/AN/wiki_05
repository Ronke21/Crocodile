<doc id="74732" wikidata="Q275045" url="?curid=74732" title="List of Navarrese monarchs">
<text>This is a list of the kings and queens of [[kingdom of Pamplona|Pamplona]], later [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]. Pamplona was the primary name of the kingdom until its union with Aragon (1076–1134). However, the territorial designation Navarre came into use as an alternative name in the late tenth century, and the name Pamplona was retained well into the twelfth century.
==House of Íñiguez, 824?–905==
The Íñiguez dynasty are credited with founding the Navarrese kingdom (of Pamplona) in or around 824 when they are said to have risen against an attempt to extend Frankish (Carolingian) authority into the region. The Cordoban sources referred to them as sometimes-rebellious vassals, rather than in the manner used to refer to the Christian realms outside their control. They were supplanted in 905 when an anti-Cordoba coalition placed the succeeding Jiménez dynasty in power.

==House of Jiménez, 905–1234==
In 905, a coalition of neighbors forced Fortún Garcés to retire to a monastery, and enthroned in his place a scion of a new dynasty. Under their reign, the name Navarre began to supplant that of Pamplona.

With the assassination of Sancho IV, Navarre was partitioned by his cousins Alfonso VI of León and Sancho Ramírez of Aragón, and the latter made king, leading to more than half a century of Aragonese control.

The death of Alfonso led to a succession crisis in Aragón and the nobles of Navarre took advantage to reestablish an independent monarchy, crowning a grandnephew (through an illegitimate brother) of the assassinated Sancho IV.

==House of Champagne, 1234–1284==

The death of Sancho VII, the last of the Jiménez kings, led to the crown of Navarre being inherited by the son of his sister Blanche, Countess of Champagne, she having been regent during much of her brother&#x27;s reign.

==Capetian dynasty, 1284–1441==

===House of Capet, 1284–1349===
Henry&#x27;s unexpected death left his infant daughter Joan as the only heir to the throne. Joan&#x27;s mother Blanche of Artois served as regent for the next ten years. In 1284 Joan was married to the future Philip IV of France, ending Blanche&#x27;s regency. Philip assumed the throne of France a year later as &quot;King of France and Navarre&quot;.

===House of Évreux, 1328–1441===

After the deaths of Louis and his infant son John, his brothers Philip and Charles held the crowns of France and Navarre until their own deaths. At that time, the crown of France passed to Philip of Valois, a distant cousin who was not descended from Joan I, and the crown of Navarre was allowed to pass to Louis&#x27; daughter Joan II, despite her presumed illegitimacy. Joan reigned together with her husband Philip III until his death, and then alone until her own death.

==House of Trastámara, 1425–1479==

Blanche I reigned together with her husband John II. In 1458, John additionally inherited the crown of Aragon from his older brother; after his death, the Navarrese crown was given to Eleanor, the only living child of him and Blanche, while his Aragonese crown was given to Ferdinand II of Aragon, son of John and his second wife Juana Enríquez. 
|John II the Great&lt;br&gt;1425–1441 (&quot;jure uxoris&quot;)&lt;br&gt;1425–1479 (&quot;de facto&quot;)||||29 June 1397&lt;br&gt;Medina del Campo&lt;br&gt;son of Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque||Blanche&lt;br&gt;6 November 1419&lt;br&gt;4 children&lt;br&gt;Juana Enríquez&lt;br&gt;2 children&lt;br&gt;||20 January 1479&lt;br&gt;Barcelona&lt;br&gt;aged 81

|}

===Claimants===
After Blanche&#x27;s death in 1441, John retained the crown of Navarre for himself until he died 38 years later, keeping it from his son and elder daughter, Charles IV and Blanche II. Conflict with his son led to the Navarrese Civil War. Though some of the sources regard Charles and Blanche as the legitimate monarchs, the &quot;de facto&quot; king of Navarre was still John II. Eleanor did not claim to be the queen until her father&#x27;s death.
|Charles IV&lt;br&gt;1441–1461 (&quot;de jure, titular&quot;)||||29 May 1421&lt;br&gt;Peñafiel&lt;br&gt;son of John II of Aragon and Blanche I of Navarre||Agnes of Cleves&lt;br&gt; No children||23 September 1461&lt;br&gt;Barcelona&lt;br&gt;aged 40

|}

==House of Foix, 1479–1517==

Eleanor, who had allied with her father against her brother and sister, outlived her father by only three weeks. By that time she was the widow of Gaston IV, Count of Foix, and their oldest son Gaston of Foix, Prince of Viana had also died. She was thus succeeded by her grandson Francis.

|}

==House of Albret, 1484–1516==
Catherine reigned together with her husband John III. After his death, she reigned alone for eight months until her own death. During their reign, Navarre was defeated by Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1512, resulting in the loss of all its territory south of the Pyrenees, including the royal capital of Pamplona. Ferdinand, the son of John II and his second wife and thus the half-brother of Catherine&#x27;s grandmother Eleanor, was then crowned King of Navarre, and that branch of the title descended through the Aragonese and Spanish monarchs. Catherine and John III were left with Lower Navarre, that small fraction of the kingdom&#x27;s former territory that is on the north side of the Pyrenees, which was united with other lands in France that were under their control.

|}

== Division of Kingdom ==
=== Lower Navarre ===
In 1530, Charles V decided to renounce definitively any claim to Lower Navarre due to the impossibility of controlling it, and because it was being effectively ruled by Henry II. However, Charles V and his mother Joana III continued as kings in Upper Navarre.

Catherine and John III were left with that small fraction of the kingdom&#x27;s former territory that is on the north side of the Pyrenees, which was united with other lands in France that were under their control.

==== House of Bourbon, 1572–1620 ====
Jeanne III reigned together with her husband Antoine until his death, and then alone until her own death. Their son Henry became King of France in 1589, taking possession of the kingdom in 1593 as the French Wars of Religion came to a close. Thereafter the crown of Navarre passed to the kings of France. In 1620, the Kingdom was merged into France; however, the French kings continued to use the title &quot;King of Navarre&quot; until 1791, and it was revived again from 1814 to 1830 during the Bourbon Restoration.

==Current claimants==
* Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria is the current heir-general to the kingdom of Navarre, under the kingdom&#x27;s own laws which allowed female succession, unlike the Salic law of France.
* Prince Louis, Duke of Anjou, is the current Legitimist claimant to the kingdoms of France and (Lower) Navarre. His claim to the Navarrese throne is based on its unification with the French throne under Louis XIII, excluding any subsequent female succession following French succession law. 
*Jean, Count of Paris, is the current Orleanist claimant to the kingdoms of France and (Lower) Navarre. His claim to the Navarrese throne is based on its unification with the French throne under Louis XIII, excluding any subsequent female succession following French succession law.
* Felipe VI of Spain uses the title King of Navarre (Upper Navarre) as part of his more extended titulary, inherited from earlier monarchs of Spain (Castile and Aragon) and based on the conquest of the majority of the ancient kingdom by Ferdinand II of Aragon.
* Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma (Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain) claims the title King of Navarre (Upper Navarre) as all titles of the Hispanic Monarchy based on the conquest of the ancient kingdom by Ferdinand II of Aragon. He considers himself legitimate successor about the traditional laws of Catholic Monarchy of Spains of Carlos María Isidro.

The &quot;de facto&quot; rulers of Navarre are the King of Spain for Upper Navarre (currently Felipe VI) and the French president for Lower Navarre (currently Emmanuel Macron, who is also an &quot;ex officio&quot; co-prince of the Principality of Andorra).

<doc id="74746" wikidata="Q476068" url="?curid=74746" title="Act of Congress">
<text>An act of Congress is a statute enacted by the United States Congress. Acts may apply only to individual entities (called private laws), or to the general public (public laws). For a bill to become an act, the text must pass through both houses with a majority, then be either signed into law by the president of the United States, be left unsigned for ten days (excluding Sundays) while Congress remains in session, or, if vetoed by the president, receive a congressional override from of both houses.

== Public law, private law, designation ==
In the United States, acts of Congress are designated as either public laws, relating to the general public, or private laws, relating to specific institutions or individuals. Since 1957, all Acts of Congress have been designated as &quot;Public Law X–Y&quot; or &quot;Private Law X–Y&quot;, where X is the number of the Congress and Y refers to the sequential order of the bill (when it was enacted). For example, P. L. 111–5 (American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) was the fifth enacted public law of the 111th United States Congress. Public laws are also often abbreviated as Pub. L. No. X–Y.

When the legislation of those two kinds are proposed, it is called public bill and private bill respectively.

==Usage==
The word &quot;act&quot;, as used in the term &quot;act of Congress&quot;, is a common, not a proper noun. The capitalization of the word &quot;act&quot; (especially when used standing alone to refer to an act mentioned earlier by its full name) is deprecated by some dictionaries and usage authorities. However, the Bluebook requires &quot;Act&quot; to be capitalized when referring to a specific legislative act. The United States Code capitalizes &quot;act&quot;.

The term &quot;act of Congress&quot; is sometimes used in informal speech to indicate something for which getting permission is burdensome. For example, &quot;It takes an act of Congress to get a building permit in this town.&quot;

==Promulgation (United States)==

An act adopted by simple majorities in both houses of Congress is promulgated, or given the force of law, in one of the following ways:
# Signature by the president of the United States,
# Inaction by the president after ten days from reception (excluding Sundays) while the Congress is in session, or
# Reconsideration by the Congress after a presidential veto during its session. (A bill must receive a majority vote in both houses to override a president&#x27;s veto.)

The president promulgates acts of Congress made by the first two methods. If an act is made by the third method, the presiding officer of the house that last reconsidered the act promulgates it.

Under the United States Constitution, if the president does not return a bill or resolution to Congress with objections before the time limit expires, then the bill automatically becomes an act; however, if the Congress is adjourned at the end of this period, then the bill dies and cannot be reconsidered (see pocket veto). If the president rejects a bill or resolution while the Congress is in session, a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress is needed for reconsideration to be successful.

Promulgation in the sense of publishing and proclaiming the law is accomplished by the president, or the relevant presiding officer in the case of an overridden veto, delivering the act to the archivist of the United States. The archivist provides for its publication as a slip law and in the United States Statutes at Large after receiving the act. Thereafter, the changes are published in the United States Code.

== Judicial review and constitutionality ==
Through the process of judicial review, an act of Congress that violates the Constitution may be declared unconstitutional by the courts. A judicial declaration that an act of Congress is unconstitutional does not remove the act from the Statutes at Large or the United States Code; rather, it prevents the act from being enforced. However, the act as published in annotated codes and legal databases is marked with annotations indicating that it is no longer good law.

<doc id="74748" wikidata="Q159701" url="?curid=74748" title="Glaucoma">
<text>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the &quot;silent thief of sight&quot; because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP). It is associated with old age, a family history of glaucoma, and certain medical conditions or the use of some medications. The word &quot;glaucoma&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning &#x27;gleaming, blue-green, gray&#x27;.

Of the different types of glaucoma, the most common are called open-angle glaucoma and closed-angle glaucoma. Inside the eye, a liquid called aqueous humor helps to maintain shape and provides nutrients. The aqueous humor normally drains through the trabecular meshwork. In open-angle glaucoma, the draining is impeded, causing the liquid to accumulate and pressure inside the eye to increase. This elevated pressure can damage the optic nerve. In closed-angle glaucoma, the drainage of the eye becomes suddenly blocked, leading to a rapid increase in intraocular pressure. This may lead to intense eye pain, blurred vision, and nausea. Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency requiring immediate attention.

If treated early, slowing or stopping the progression of glaucoma is possible. Regular eye examinations, especially if the person is over 40 or has a family history of glaucoma, are essential for early detection. Treatment typically includes prescription of eye drops, medication, laser treatment or surgery. The goal of these treatments is to decrease eye pressure.
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asians. It occurs more commonly among older people, and closed-angle glaucoma is more common in women.
==Epidemiology==
In 2013 for the population aged 40-80 years, the global prevalence of glaucoma was estimated at 3.54%, thus affecting 64.3 million worldwide. The same year, 2.97 million people in North America had open-angle glaucoma. By 2040, the prevalence of all types of glaucoma was projected to increase to 111.82 million worldwide and to 4.72 million in North America.

Globally, glaucoma is the second-leading cause of blindness, while cataracts are a more common cause. In the United States, glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness for African Americans, who have higher rates of primary open-angle glaucoma, and Hispanic Americans. Bilateral vision loss can negatively affect mobility and interfere with driving.

A meta-analysis published in 2009 found that people with primary open-angle glaucoma do not have increased mortality rates, or increased risk of cardiovascular death.

A 2024 &quot;JAMA Ophthalmology&quot; article reports that in 2022, an estimated 4.22 million people in the U.S. had glaucoma, with 1.49 million experiencing vision impairment due to the condition, according to a meta-analysis. The study found that Black adults were about twice as likely to be affected by glaucoma as White adults. Glaucoma prevalence was 1.62% among individuals aged 18 and older and 2.56% among those aged 40 and older, while vision-affecting glaucoma occurred in 0.57% and 0.91% of these age groups, respectively.

Open-angle glaucoma usually presents with no symptoms early in the course of the disease, but it may gradually progress to involve difficulties with vision. It usually involves deficits in the peripheral vision followed by central vision loss as the disease progresses, but less commonly it may present as central vision loss or patchy areas of vision loss. On an eye examination, optic nerve changes are seen indicating damage to the optic nerve head (increased cup-to-disc ratio on fundoscopic examination).

Acute angle-closure glaucoma, a medical emergency due to the risk of impending permanent vision loss, is characterized by sudden ocular pain, seeing halos around lights, red eye, very high intraocular pressure, nausea and vomiting, and suddenly decreased vision. Acute angle-closure glaucoma may further present with corneal edema, engorged conjunctival vessels, and a fixed and dilated pupil on examination.

Opaque specks may occur in the lens in glaucoma, known as glaukomflecken. The word is German, meaning &quot;glaucoma-specks&quot;.

==Risk factors==
Glaucoma can affect anyone. Some people have a higher risk or susceptibility to develop glaucoma due to certain risk factors, including increasing age, high intraocular pressure, a family history of glaucoma, and use of steroid medications. 

=== Ocular hypertension ===
Ocular hypertension (increased pressure within the eye) is an important risk factor for glaucoma, but only about 10-70% of people - depending on ethnic group - with primary open-angle glaucoma actually have elevated ocular pressure. Ocular hypertension—an intraocular pressure above the traditional threshold of or even above —is not necessarily a pathological condition, but it increases the risk of developing glaucoma. 

A study with 1636 persons aged 40-80 who had an intraocular pressure above 24mmHg in at least one eye, but no indications of eye damages, showed that after five years, 9.5% of the untreated participants and 4.4% of the treated participants had developed glaucomatous symptoms, meaning that only about one in 10 untreated people with elevated intraocular pressure will develop glaucomatous symptoms over that period of time. Therefore, whether every person with an elevated intraocular pressure should receive glaucoma therapy is a matter of debate. As of 2018, most ophthalmologists favored treatment of those with additional risk factors.

For eye pressures, a value of above atmospheric pressure is often used, with higher pressures leading to a greater risk. However, some may have high eye pressure for years and never develop damage. Conversely, optic nerve damage may occur with normal pressure, known as normal-tension glaucoma. In case of above-normal intraocular pressure, the mechanism of open-angle glaucoma is believed to be the impeded exit of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork, while in closed-angle glaucoma, the iris blocks the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis is achieved by performing an eye examination. Often, the optic nerve shows an abnormal amount of cupping.

===Family history and genetics===
Positive family history is a risk factor for glaucoma. The relative risk of having primary open-angle glaucoma is increased about two- to four-fold for people who have a sibling with glaucoma. Glaucoma, particularly primary open-angle glaucoma, is associated with mutations in several genes, including &quot;MYOC, ASB10, WDR36, NTF4&quot;, &quot;TBK1&quot;, and &quot;RPGRIP1.&quot; Many of these genes are involved in critical cellular processes that are implicated in the development and progression of glaucoma, including regulation of intraocular pressure, retinal ganglion cell health, and optic nerve function. Normal-tension glaucoma, which comprises 30-90% of primary open-angle glaucoma (depending on ethnic group), is also associated with genetic mutations (including &quot;OPA1&quot; and &quot;OPTN&quot; genes).

Additionally, some rare genetic conditions increase the risk of glaucoma, such as Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and primary congenital glaucoma, which is associated with mutations in &quot;CYP1B1&quot; or &quot;LTBP2.&quot; They are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is associated with &quot;PITX2&quot; or &quot;FOXC1&quot;.

===Ethnicity===
The total prevalence of glaucoma is about the same in North America and Asia, but the prevalence of angle-closure glaucoma is four times higher in Asia than in North America.

In the United States, glaucoma is more common in African Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans.

===Other===

Other factors can cause glaucoma, known as &quot;secondary glaucoma&quot;, including prolonged use of steroids (steroid-induced glaucoma); conditions that severely restrict blood flow to the eye, such as severe diabetic retinopathy and central retinal vein occlusion (neovascular glaucoma); ocular trauma (angle-recession glaucoma); plateau iris; and inflammation of the middle layer of the pigmented vascular eye structure (uveitis), known as uveitic glaucoma.

==Pathophysiology==

The main effect of glaucoma is damage to the optic nerve. Eventually, this damage leads to vision loss, which can deteriorate with time. The underlying cause of open-angle glaucoma remains unclear. Several theories exist on its exact etiology. Intraocular pressure is a function of production of liquid aqueous humor by the ciliary processes of the eye, and its drainage through the trabecular meshwork. Aqueous humor flows from the ciliary processes into the posterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the lens and the zonules of Zinn, and anteriorly by the iris. It then flows through the pupil of the iris into the anterior chamber, bounded posteriorly by the iris and anteriorly by the cornea.

From here, the trabecular meshwork drains aqueous humor via the scleral venous sinus (Schlemm&#x27;s canal) into scleral plexuses and general blood circulation.

In open/wide-angle glaucoma, flow is reduced through the trabecular meshwork, due to the degeneration and obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, whose original function is to absorb the aqueous humor. Loss of aqueous humor absorption leads to increased resistance and thus a chronic, painless buildup of pressure in the eye.

In primary angle-closure glaucoma, the iridocorneal angle is narrowed or completely closed, obstructing the flow of aqueous humor to the trabecular meshwork for drainage. This is usually due to the forward displacement of the iris against the cornea, resulting in angle closure. This accumulation of aqueous humor causes an acute increase in pressure and damage to the optic nerve.

The pathophysiology of glaucoma is not well understood. Several theories exist regarding the mechanism of the damage to the optic nerve in glaucoma. The biomechanical theory hypothesizes that the retinal ganglion-cell axons (which form the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer) are particularly susceptible to mechanical damage from increases in the intraocular pressure as they pass through pores at the lamina cribrosa. Thus, increases in intraocular pressure would cause nerve damage as seen in glaucoma. The vascular theory hypothesizes that a decreased blood supply to the retinal ganglions cells leads to nerve damage. This decrease in blood supply may be due to increasing intraocular pressures, and may also be due to systemic hypotension, vasospasm, or atherosclerosis. This is supported by evidence that those with low blood pressure, particularly low diastolic blood pressure, are at an increased risk of glaucoma. 

The primary neurodegeneration theory hypothesizes that a primary neurodegenerative process may be responsible for degeneration at the optic nerve head in glaucoma. This would be consistent with a possible mechanism of normal tension glaucoma (those with open-angle glaucoma with normal eye pressures) and is supported by evidence showing a correlation of glaucoma with Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia and other causes of cognitive decline.
Both experimental and clinical studies implicate that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of open-angle glaucoma as well as in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Degeneration of axons of the retinal ganglion cells (the optic nerve) is a hallmark of glaucoma. The inconsistent relationship of glaucomatous optic neuropathy with increased intraocular pressure has provoked hypotheses and studies on anatomic structure, eye development, nerve compression trauma, optic nerve blood flow, excitatory neurotransmitter, trophic factor, retinal ganglion cell or axon degeneration, glial support cell, immune system, aging mechanisms of neuron loss, and severing of the nerve fibers at the scleral edge.

==Diagnosis==
Screening for glaucoma is an integral part of a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. The workup for glaucoma involves taking a thorough case history, with the emphasis on assessment of risk factors. 

The baseline glaucoma evaluation tests include intraocular pressure measurement by using tonometry, anterior chamber angle assessment by optical coherence tomography, inspecting the drainage angle (gonioscopy), and retinal nerve fiber layer assessment with a fundus examination, measuring corneal thickness (pachymetry), and visual field testing.

=== Types ===
Glaucoma has been classified into specific types:

===Primary glaucoma and its variants===
Primary glaucoma (H40.1-H40.2)
*Primary open-angle glaucoma, also known as chronic open-angle glaucoma, chronic simple glaucoma, glaucoma simplex
:*High-tension glaucoma
:*Low-tension glaucoma
*Primary angle closure glaucoma, also known as primary closed-angle glaucoma, narrow-angle glaucoma, pupil-block glaucoma, acute congestive glaucoma
:*Acute angle closure glaucoma (&quot;aka&quot; AACG)
:*Chronic angle closure glaucoma
:*Intermittent angle closure glaucoma
:*Superimposed on chronic open-angle closure glaucoma (&quot;combined mechanism&quot; – uncommon)

Variants of primary glaucoma
*Pigmentary glaucoma
*Exfoliation glaucoma, also known as pseudoexfoliative glaucoma or glaucoma capsulare
*Primary juvenile glaucoma

Primary angle closure glaucoma is caused by contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork, which in turn obstructs outflow of the aqueous humor from the eye. This contact between iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises. In over half of all cases, prolonged contact between iris and TM causes the formation of synechiae (effectively &quot;scars&quot;).

These cause permanent obstruction of aqueous outflow. In some cases, pressure may rapidly build up in the eye, causing pain and redness (symptomatic, or so-called &quot;acute&quot;-angle closure). In this situation, the vision may become blurred, and halos may be seen around bright lights. Accompanying symptoms may include a headache and vomiting.

Diagnosis is made from physical signs and symptoms - pupils mid-dilated and unresponsive to light, cornea edematous (cloudy), reduced vision, redness, and pain. However, the majority of cases are asymptomatic. Prior to the very severe loss of vision, these cases can only be identified by examination, generally by an eye-care professional.

===Developmental glaucoma===
Developmental glaucoma (Q15.0)
*Primary congenital glaucoma
*Infantile glaucoma
*Glaucoma associated with hereditary or familial diseases

===Secondary glaucoma===
Secondary glaucoma (H40.3-H40.6)
*Inflammatory glaucoma
:*Uveitis of all types
:*Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis
*Phacogenic glaucoma
:*Angle-closure glaucoma with mature cataract
:*Phacoanaphylactic glaucoma secondary to rupture of lens capsule
:*Phacolytic glaucoma due to phacotoxic meshwork blockage
:*Subluxation of lens
*Glaucoma secondary to intraocular hemorrhage

:*Hyphema
:*Hemolytic glaucoma, also known as erythroclastic glaucoma
*Traumatic glaucoma
:*Angle recession glaucoma: Traumatic recession on anterior chamber angle
:*Postsurgical glaucoma
::*Aphakic pupillary block
::*Ciliary block glaucoma
*Neovascular glaucoma (see below for more details)
*Drug-induced glaucoma
:*Corticosteroid induced glaucoma
:*Alpha-chymotrypsin glaucoma. Postoperative ocular hypertension from use of alpha chymotrypsin.
*Glaucoma of miscellaneous origin
:*Associated with intraocular tumors
:*Associated with retinal detachments
:*Secondary to severe chemical burns of the eye
:*Associated with essential iris atrophy
:*Toxic glaucoma

Neovascular glaucoma, an uncommon type of glaucoma, is difficult or nearly impossible to treat, and is often caused by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). It may also be triggered by other conditions that result in ischemia of the retina or ciliary body. Individuals with poor blood flow to the eye are highly at risk for this condition.

Neovascular glaucoma results when new, abnormal vessels begin developing in the angle of the eye that begin blocking the drainage. People with such condition begin to rapidly lose their eyesight. Sometimes, the disease appears very rapidly, especially after cataract surgery procedures.

Toxic glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma with an unexplained significant rise of intraocular pressure following unknown pathogenesis. Intraocular pressure can sometimes reach . It characteristically manifests as ciliary body inflammation and massive trabecular edema that sometimes extends to Schlemm&#x27;s canal. This condition is differentiated from malignant glaucoma by the presence of a deep and clear anterior chamber and a lack of aqueous misdirection. Also, the corneal appearance is not as hazy. A reduction in visual acuity can occur followed neuroretinal breakdown.

===Absolute glaucoma===
Absolute glaucoma (H44.5) is the end stage of all types of glaucoma. The eye has no vision, absence of pupillary light reflex and pupillary response, and has a stony appearance. Severe pain is present in the eye. The treatment of absolute glaucoma is a destructive procedure like cyclocryoapplication, cyclophotocoagulation, or injection of 99% alcohol.

==Visual field defects in glaucoma==
In glaucoma visual field defects result from damage to the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Field defects are seen mainly in primary open angle glaucoma. Because of the unique anatomy of the RNFL, many noticeable patterns are seen in the visual field. Most of the early glaucomatous changes are seen within the central visual field, mainly in Bjerrum&#x27;s area, 10-20° from fixation.

Following are the common glaucomatous field defects:

* Generalized depression: Generalized depression is seen in early stages of glaucoma and many other conditions. Mild constriction of central and peripheral visual field due to isopter contraction comes under generalized depression. If all the isopters show similar depression to the same point, it is then called a contraction of visual field. Relative paracentral scotomas are the areas where smaller and dimmer targets are not visualized by the patient. Larger and brighter targets can be seen. Small paracentral depressions, mainly superonasal are seen in normal tension glaucoma (NTG). The generalized depression of the entire field may be seen in cataract also.
* Baring of blind spot: &quot;Baring of blind spot&quot; means exclusion of blind spot from the central field due to inward curve of the outer boundary of 30° central field. It is only an early non-specific visual field change, without much diagnostic value in glaucoma.
* Small wing-shaped Paracentral scotoma: Small wing-shaped Paracentral scotoma within Bjerrum&#x27;s area is the earliest clinically significant field defect seen in glaucoma. It may also be associated with nasal steps. Scotoma may be seen above or below the blind spot.
* Siedel&#x27;s sickle-shaped scotoma: Paracentral scotoma joins with the blind spot to form the Seidel sign. 
* Arcuate or Bjerrum&#x27;s scotoma: It is formed at later stages of glaucoma by extension of Seidel&#x27;s scotoma in an area either above or below the fixation point to reach the horizontal line. Peripheral breakthrough may occur due to damage of nerve fibers.
* Ring or Double arcuate scotoma: Two arcuate scotomas join to form a Ring or Double arcuate scotoma. This defect is seen in advanced stages of glaucoma.
* Roenne&#x27;s central nasal step: It is created when two arcuate scotomas run in different arcs to form a right angled defect. This is also seen in advanced stages of glaucoma.
* Peripheral field defects: Peripheral field defects may occur in early or late stages of glaucoma. Roenne&#x27;s peripheral nasal steps occur due to contraction of peripheral isopter.
* Tubular vision: Since macular fibers are the most resistant to glaucomatous damage, the central vision remains unaffected until end stages of glaucoma. Tubular vision or Tunnel vision is the loss of peripheral vision with retention of central vision, resulting in a constricted circular tunnel-like field of vision. It is seen in the end stages of glaucoma. Retinitis pigmentosa is another disease that causes tubular vision.
* Temporal island of vision: It is also seen in end stages of glaucoma. The temporal islands lie outside of the central 24 to 30° visual field, so it may not be visible with standard central field measurements done in glaucoma.

==Screening==
The United States Preventive Services Task Force stated, as of 2013, that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for glaucoma. Therefore, there is no national screening program in the US. Screening, however, is recommended starting at age 40 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

There is a glaucoma screening program in the UK. Those at risk are advised to have an eye examination at least once a year.

==Treatment==
The goal of glaucoma management for patients with increased intraocular pressure is to decrease the intraocular pressure (IOP), thus slowing the progression of glaucoma and preserving the quality of life for patients, with minimal side-effects. This requires appropriate diagnostic techniques and follow-up examinations, and judicious selection of treatments for the individual patient. Although increased IOP is only one of the major risk factors for glaucoma, lowering it via various pharmaceuticals and/or surgical techniques is currently the mainstay of glaucoma treatment. 

Vascular flow and neurodegenerative theories of glaucomatous optic neuropathy have prompted studies on various neuroprotective therapeutic strategies, including nutritional compounds, some of which may be regarded by clinicians as safe for use now, while others are on trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOI10.1016/B978-0-323-88442-6.00039-X&quot;&gt;Yu Jun Wo, Ching‐Yu Cheng, Rachel S. Chong: &quot;Vascular health and glaucoma.&quot; In: Kevin Gillmann, Kaweh Mansouri (Eds.): &quot;The Science of Glaucoma Management. From Translational Research to Next-Generation Clinical Practice&quot;, Elsevier 2023, ISBN 978-0-323-88443-3, p. 63–79, , preview Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental stress is also considered as consequence and cause of vision loss which means that stress management training, autogenic training and other techniques to cope with stress can be helpful.

===Medication===

There are several pressure-lowering medication groups that could be used in lowering the IOP, usually eyedrops. The choice of medication usually depends on the dose, duration and the side effects of each medication. However, in general, prostaglandin analogues are the first-line treatment for glaucoma.

Prostaglandin analogues, such as latanoprost, bimatoprost and travoprost, reduce the IOP by increasing the aqueous fluid outflow through the draining angle. It is usually prescribed once daily at night. The systemic side effects of this class are minimal. However, they can cause local side effects including redness of the conjunctiva, change in the iris color and eyelash elongation.

There are several other classes of medications that could be used as a second-line in case of treatment failure or presence of contraindications to prostaglandin analogues. These include:

* Topical beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, such as timolol, levobunolol, and betaxolol, decrease aqueous humor production by the epithelium of the ciliary body.
* Alpha2-adrenergic agonists, such as brimonidine and apraclonidine, work by a dual mechanism, decreasing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow.
* Less-selective alpha agonists, such as epinephrine, decrease aqueous humor production through vasoconstriction of ciliary body blood vessels, useful only in open-angle glaucoma. Epinephrine&#x27;s mydriatic effect, however, renders it unsuitable for closed-angle glaucoma due to further narrowing of the uveoscleral outflow (i.e. further closure of trabecular meshwork, which is responsible for absorption of aqueous humor).
* Miotic agents (parasympathomimetics), such as pilocarpine, work by contraction of the ciliary muscle, opening the trabecular meshwork and allowing increased outflow of the aqueous humour. Echothiophate, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, is used in chronic glaucoma.
* Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as dorzolamide, brinzolamide, and acetazolamide, lower secretion of aqueous humor by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary body.

Each of these medicines may have local and systemic side effects. Wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops may result in fewer adverse effects. Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes.

The possible neuroprotective effects of various topical and systemic medications are also being investigated.

==== Adherence ====
Poor compliance with medications and follow-up visits is a major reason for treatment failure and disease progression in glaucoma patients. Poor adherence could lead to increased complication rates, thus increasing the need of non-pharmacological interventions including surgery. Patient education and communication must be ongoing to sustain successful treatment plans for this lifelong disease with no early symptoms.

===Laser===
Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) may be used to treat open-angle glaucoma, but this is a temporary solution, not a cure. A 50-μm argon laser spot is aimed at the trabecular meshwork to stimulate the opening of the mesh to allow more outflow of aqueous fluid. Usually, half of the angle is treated at a time. Traditional laser trabeculoplasty uses a thermal argon laser in an argon laser trabeculoplasty procedure.

Nd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) may be used in patients susceptible to or affected by angle closure glaucoma or pigment dispersion syndrome. During laser iridotomy, laser energy is used to make a small, full-thickness opening in the iris to equalize the pressure between the front and back of the iris, thus correcting any abnormal bulging of the iris. In people with narrow angles, this can uncover the trabecular meshwork. In some cases of intermittent or short-term angle closure, this may lower the eye pressure. Laser iridotomy reduces the risk of developing an attack of acute angle closure. In most cases, it also reduces the risk of developing chronic angle closure or of adhesions of the iris to the trabecular meshwork. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have shown that an optimal iridotomy size to relieve the pressure differential between the anterior and posterior side of the iris is around 0.1 mm to 0.2 mm. This coincides with clinical practice of LPI where an iridotomy size of 150 to 200 microns is commonly used. However, larger iriditomy sizes are sometimes necessary.

===Surgery===

Both laser and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma. Surgery is the primary therapy for those with congenital glaucoma. Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is not yet a cure for glaucoma.

====Canaloplasty====
Canaloplasty is a nonpenetrating procedure using microcatheter technology. To perform a canaloplasty, an incision is made into the eye to gain access to the Schlemm&#x27;s canal in a similar fashion to a viscocanalostomy. A microcatheter will circumnavigate the canal around the iris, enlarging the main drainage channel and its smaller collector channels through the injection of a sterile, gel-like material called viscoelastic. The catheter is then removed and a suture is placed within the canal and tightened.

By opening the canal, the pressure inside the eye may be relieved, although the reason is unclear, since the canal (of Schlemm) does not have any significant fluid resistance in glaucoma or healthy eyes. Long-term results are not available.

====Trabeculectomy====
The most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma is the trabeculectomy. Here, a partial thickness flap is made in the scleral wall of the eye, and a window opening is made under the flap to remove a portion of the trabecular meshwork. The scleral flap is then sutured loosely back in place to allow fluid to flow out of the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure and the formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.

Scarring can occur around or over the flap opening, causing it to become less effective or lose effectiveness altogether. Traditionally, chemotherapeutic adjuvants, such as mitomycin C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), are applied with soaked sponges on the wound bed to prevent filtering blebs from scarring by inhibiting fibroblast proliferation. Contemporary alternatives to prevent the scarring of the meshwork opening include the sole or combinative implementation of nonchemotherapeutic adjuvants such as the Ologen collagen matrix, which has been clinically shown to increase the success rates of surgical treatment.

Collagen matrix prevents scarring by randomizing and modulating fibroblast proliferation in addition to mechanically preventing wound contraction and adhesion.

====Glaucoma drainage implants====

The first glaucoma drainage implant was developed in 1966. Since then, several types of implants have followed on from the original: the Baerveldt tube shunt, or the valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve implant or the ExPress Mini Shunt and the later generation pressure ridge Molteno implants. These are indicated for glaucoma patients not responding to maximal medical therapy, with previous failed guarded filtering surgery (trabeculectomy). The flow tube is inserted into the anterior chamber of the eye, and the plate is implanted underneath the conjunctiva to allow a flow of aqueous fluid out of the eye into a chamber called a bleb.

*The first-generation Molteno and other nonvalved implants sometimes require the ligation of the tube until the bleb formed is mildly fibrosed and water-tight. This is done to reduce postoperative hypotony—sudden drops in postoperative intraocular pressure.
* Valved implants, such as the Ahmed glaucoma valve, attempt to control postoperative hypotony by using a mechanical valve.
* Ab interno implants, such as the Xen Gel Stent, are transscleral implants by an ab interno procedure to channel aqueous humor into the non-dissected Tenon&#x27;s space, creating a subconjunctival drainage area similar to a bleb. The implants are transscleral and different from other ab interno implants that do not create a transscleral drainage, such as iStent, CyPass, or Hydrus.

The ongoing scarring over the conjunctival dissipation segment of the shunt may become too thick for the aqueous humor to filter through. This may require preventive measures using antifibrotic medications, such as 5-fluorouracil or mitomycin-C (during the procedure), or other nonantifibrotic medication methods, such as collagen matrix implant, or biodegradable spacer, or later on create a necessity for revision surgery with the sole or combinative use of donor patch grafts or collagen matrix implant.

====Laser-assisted nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy====
The most common surgical approach currently used for the treatment of glaucoma is trabeculectomy, in which the sclera is punctured to alleviate intraocular pressure.

Nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (NPDS) surgery is a similar, but modified, procedure, in which instead of puncturing the scleral bed and trabecular meshwork under a scleral flap, a second deep scleral flap is created, excised, with further procedures of deroofing the Schlemm&#x27;s canal, upon which, percolation of liquid from the inner eye is achieved and thus alleviating intraocular pressure, without penetrating the eye. NPDS is demonstrated to have significantly fewer side effects than trabeculectomy. However, NPDS is performed manually and requires higher level of skills that may be assisted with instruments. In order to prevent wound adhesion after deep scleral excision and to maintain good filtering results, NPDS as with other non-penetrating procedures is sometimes performed with a variety of biocompatible spacers or devices, such as the Aquaflow collagen wick, ologen Collagen Matrix, or Xenoplast glaucoma implant.

Laser-assisted NPDS is performed with the use of a CO2 laser system. The laser-based system is self-terminating once the required scleral thickness and adequate drainage of the intraocular fluid have been achieved. This self-regulation effect is achieved as the CO2 laser essentially stops ablating as soon as it comes in contact with the intraocular percolated liquid, which occurs as soon as the laser reaches the optimal residual intact layer thickness.

==== Clear lens extraction ====

For people with chronic closed-angle glaucoma, lens extraction can relieve the block created by the pupil and help regulate the intraocular pressure. A study found that CLE is even more effective than laser peripheral iridotomy in patients with angle closure glaucoma. A systematic review comparing lens extraction and laser peripheral iridotomy for treating acute primary angle closure found that lens extraction potentially provides better intraocular pressure control and reduces medication needs over time. However, it remains uncertain if it significantly lowers the risk of recurrent episodes or reduces the need for additional operations. 

=== Treatment approaches for primary glaucoma ===
Primary angle closure glaucoma: Once any symptoms have been controlled, the first line (and often definitive) treatment is laser iridotomy. This may be performed using either Nd:YAG or argon lasers, or in some cases by conventional incisional surgery. The goal of treatment is to reverse and prevent contact between the iris and trabecular meshwork. In early to moderately advanced cases, iridotomy is successful in opening the angle in around 75% of cases. In the other 25%, laser iridoplasty, medication (pilocarpine) or incisional surgery may be required.

Primary open-angle glaucoma: Prostaglandin agonists work by opening uveoscleral passageways. Beta-blockers, such as timolol, work by decreasing aqueous formation. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease bicarbonate formation from ciliary processes in the eye, thus decreasing the formation of aqueous humor. Parasympathetic analogs are drugs that work on the trabecular outflow by opening up the passageway and constricting the pupil. Alpha 2 agonists (brimonidine, apraclonidine) both decrease fluid production (via inhibition of AC) and increase drainage. A review of people with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension concluded that medical IOP-lowering treatment slowed down the progression of visual field loss.

=== Neovascular glaucoma ===
Anti-VEGF agents as injectable medications, along with other standard of care treatment for decreasing intraocular pressure, may improve pressure in people with neovascular glaucoma for short periods of time. Evidence suggests that this improvement may last 4–6 weeks. There is no sufficient evidence to suggest that anti-VEGF medications are effective either for short-term or for longer-term treatment. The short, medium, and long-term safety of anti-VEGF treatment has not been well investigated.

=== Other ===
*Cannabis is not suggested for treatment of glaucoma by the American Glaucoma Society for adults or for children.
*Sepetaprost, investigational new drug

==Prognosis==
In open-angle glaucoma, the typical progression from normal vision to complete blindness takes about 25 years to 70 years without treatment, depending on the method of estimation used.

== History ==
The association of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma was first described by Englishman Richard Banister in 1622: &quot;...that the Eye be grown more solid and hard, then naturally it should be...&quot;. Angle-closure glaucoma was treated with cataract extraction by John Collins Warren in Boston as early as 1806. The invention of the ophthalmoscope by Hermann Helmholtz in 1851 enabled ophthalmologists for the first time to identify the pathological hallmark of glaucoma, the excavation of the optic nerve head due to retinal ganglion cell loss. The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist Hjalmar August Schiøtz in 1905. About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Bern, Switzerland, developed his applanation tonometer which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor. In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research like insufficient blood supply – often associated with low or irregular blood pressure – to the retina and optic nerve head. The first drug to reduce IOP, pilocarpine, was introduced in the 1870s; other major innovations in pharmacological glaucoma therapy were the introduction of beta blocker eye drops in the 1970s and of prostaglandin analogues and topical (locally administered) carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the mid-1990s. Early surgical techniques like iridectomy and fistulating methods have recently been supplemented by less invasive procedures like small implants, a range of options now widely called MIGS (micro-invasive glaucoma surgery).

===Etymology===
The word &quot;glaucoma&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek , a derivative of &quot;(glaukos),&quot; which commonly described the color of eyes which were not dark (i.e. blue, green, light gray). Eyes described as due to disease might have had a gray cataract in the Hippocratic era, or, in the early Common Era, the greenish pupillary hue sometimes seen in angle-closure glaucoma. This colour is reflected in the Chinese word for glaucoma, 青光眼 &quot;(qīngguāngyǎn),&quot; literally “cyan-light eye”. An alternative hypothesis connects the name to the Ancient Greek noun for &#x27;owl&#x27;, or (both &quot;glaux&quot;).

==Research==
=== Eye drops vs. other treatments ===
The TAGS randomised controlled trial investigated if eye drops or trabeculectomy is more effective in treating advanced primary open-angle glaucoma. After two years researchers found that vision and quality of life are similar in both treatments. At the same time eye pressure was lower in people who underwent surgery and in the long-run surgery is more cost-effective.

The LiGHT trial compared the effectiveness of eye drops and selective laser trabeculoplasty for open angle glaucoma. Both contributed to a similar quality of life but most people undergoing laser treatment were able to stop using eye drops. Laser trabeculoplasty was also shown to be more cost-effective.

===Comparison of effects of brimonidine and timolol===
A 2013 Cochrane systematic review compared the effect of brimonidine and timolol in slowing the progression of open angle glaucoma in adult participants. The results showed that participants assigned to brimonidine showed less visual field progression than those assigned to timolol, though the results were not significant, given the heavy loss-to-followup and limited evidence. The mean intraocular pressures for both groups were similar. Participants in the brimonidine group had a higher occurrence of side effects caused by medication than participants in the timolol group.

==Social disparities in glaucoma care and research==

A study conducted in UK showed that people living in an area of high deprivation were likely to be diagnosed in the later stage of the disease. It also showed that there were lack of professional ophthalmic services in the area of high deprivation.

A study in 2017 shows that there is a huge difference in the volume of glaucoma testing depending on the type of insurance in the US. Researchers reviewed 21,766 persons age ≥ 40 years old with newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma (OAG) and found that Medicaid recipients had substantially lower volume of glaucoma testing performed compared to patients with commercial health insurance.

Results from a meta-analysis of 33,428 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) participants published in 2021 suggest that there are substantial ethnic and racial disparities in clinical trials in the US. Although ethnic and racial minorities have a higher disease burden, the 70.7% of the study participants was White as opposed to 16.8% Black and 3.4% Hispanic/Latino.

<doc id="74761" wikidata="Q657886" url="?curid=74761" title="Miller cycle">
<text>In engineering, the Miller cycle is a thermodynamic cycle used in a type of internal combustion engine. The Miller cycle was patented by Ralph Miller, an American engineer, dated Dec 24, 1957. The engine may be two- or four-stroke and may be run on diesel fuel, gases, or dual fuel. It uses a supercharger or a turbocharger to offset the performance loss of the Atkinson cycle.

This type of engine was first used in ships and stationary power-generating plants, and is now used for some railway locomotives such as the GE PowerHaul. It was adapted by Mazda for their KJ-ZEM V6, used in the Millenia sedan, and in their Eunos 800 sedan (Australia) luxury cars. Subaru combined a Miller-cycle flat-4 with a hybrid driveline for their concept &quot;Turbo Parallel Hybrid&quot; car, known as the Subaru B5-TPH. Nissan introduced a small three-cylinder engine with variable intake valve timing that claims to operate an Atkinson cycle at low load (thus the lower power density is not a handicap) and a Miller cycle when under light boost.

==Overview==
A traditional reciprocating internal combustion engine uses four strokes, of which two can be considered high-power: the compression stroke (high power flow from crankshaft to the charge) and power stroke (high power flow from the combustion gases to crankshaft).

In the Miller cycle, the intake valve is left open longer than it would be in an Otto-cycle engine. In effect, the compression stroke is two discrete cycles: the initial portion when the intake valve is open and final portion when the intake valve is closed. This two-stage compression stroke creates the so-called &quot;fifth&quot; stroke that the Miller cycle introduces. As the piston initially moves upwards in what is traditionally the compression stroke, the charge is partially expelled back out through the still-open intake valve. Typically, this loss of charge air would result in a loss of power. However, in the Miller cycle, this is compensated for by the use of a supercharger. The supercharger typically will need to be of the positive-displacement (Roots or screw) type due to its ability to produce boost at relatively low engine speeds. Otherwise, low-speed power will suffer. Alternatively, a turbocharger can be used for greater efficiency, if low-speed operation is not required, or supplemented with electric motors.

In the Miller-cycle engine, the piston begins to compress the fuel-air mixture only after the intake valve closes; and the intake valve closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total piston travel of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the fuel-air mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the compression stroke. During the initial part of the compression stroke, the piston pushes part of the fuel-air mixture through the still-open intake valve, and back into the intake manifold.

===Charge temperature===
The charge air is compressed using a supercharger (and cooled by an intercooler) to a pressure higher than that needed for the engine cycle, but filling of the cylinders is reduced by suitable timing of the inlet valve. Thus the expansion of the air and the consequent cooling take place in the cylinders and partially in the inlet. Reducing the temperature of the air/fuel charge allows the power of a given engine to be increased without making any major changes such as increasing the cylinder/piston compression relationship. When the temperature is lower at the beginning of the cycle, the air density is increased without a change in pressure (the mechanical limit of the engine is shifted to a higher power). At the same time, the thermal load limit shifts due to the lower mean temperatures of the cycle.

This allows ignition timing to be advanced beyond what is normally allowed before the onset of detonation, thus increasing the overall efficiency still further. An additional advantage of the lower final charge temperature is that the emission of NOx in diesel engines is decreased, which is an important design parameter in large diesel engines on board ships and power plants.

===Compression ratio===
Efficiency is increased by having the same effective compression ratio and a larger expansion ratio. This allows more work to be extracted from the expanding gases as they are expanded almost to atmospheric pressure. In an ordinary spark ignition engine at the end of the expansion stroke of a wide open throttle cycle, the gases are at around five atmospheres when the exhaust valve opens. Because the stroke is limited to that of the compression, still some work could be extracted from the gas. Delaying the closing of the intake valve in the Miller cycle in effect shortens the compression stroke compared to the expansion stroke. This allows the gases to be expanded to atmospheric pressure, increasing the efficiency of the cycle. 

===Supercharger losses or turbocharger lag===
The benefits of using positive-displacement superchargers come with a cost due to parasitic load. About 15 to 20% of the power generated by a supercharged engine is usually required to do the work of driving the supercharger, which compresses the intake charge (also known as boost). On the other hand while turbochargers aren&#x27;t as high in terms of being a parasitic load, the spooling up of the turbine from the exhaust gases would result in the engine being stuck in the Atkinson cycle at lower RPM. This inconsistency could in principle be addressed with techniques like the MGU-H that was used in Formula 1 but this has never been implemented on commercial engines and much less specifically on Atkinson cycle engines. 

===Major advantage/drawback===
The major advantage of the cycle is that the expansion ratio is greater than the compression ratio. By intercooling after the external supercharging, an opportunity exists to reduce NOx emissions for diesel, or knock for spark ignition engines. However, multiple tradeoffs on boosting system efficiency and friction (due to the larger displacement) need to be balanced for every application.

==Summary of the patent==
The overview given above may describe a modern version of the Miller cycle, but it differs in some respects from the 1957 patent. The patent describes &quot;a new and improved method of operating a supercharged intercooled engine&quot;. The engine may be two-cycle or four-cycle and the fuel may be diesel, dual fuel, or gas. It is clear from the context that &quot;gas&quot; means gaseous fuel and not gasoline. The pressure-charger shown in the diagrams is a turbocharger, not a positive-displacement supercharger. The engine (whether four-stroke or two-stroke) has a conventional valve or port layout, but an additional &quot;compression control valve&quot; (CCV) is in the cylinder head. The servo mechanism, operated by inlet manifold pressure, controls the lift of the CCV during part of the compression stroke and releases air from the cylinder to the exhaust manifold. The CCV would have maximum lift at full load and minimum lift at no load. The effect is to produce an engine with a variable compression ratio. As inlet manifold pressure goes up (because of the action of the turbocharger) the effective compression ratio in the cylinder goes down (because of the increased lift of the CCV) and vice versa. This &quot;will insure proper starting and ignition of the fuel at light loads&quot;.

==Atkinson-cycle engine==
A similar delayed valve-closing method is used in some modern versions of Atkinson cycle engines, but without the supercharging. These engines are generally found on hybrid electric vehicles, where efficiency is the goal, and the power lost compared to the Miller cycle is made up through the use of electric motors.

<doc id="74773" wikidata="Q156778" url="?curid=74773" title="Nero Claudius Drusus">
<text>Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus (38–9 BC), commonly known in English as Drusus the Elder, was a Roman politician and military commander. He was a patrician Claudian but his mother was from a plebeian family. He was the son of Livia Drusilla and the stepson of her second husband, the Emperor Augustus. He was also brother of the Emperor Tiberius; the father of the Emperor Claudius and general Germanicus; paternal grandfather of the Emperor Caligula, and maternal great-grandfather of the Emperor Nero.

Drusus launched the first major Roman campaigns across the Rhine and began the conquest of Germania, becoming the first Roman general to reach the Weser and Elbe rivers. In 12 BC, he led a successful campaign into Germania, subjugating the Sicambri. Later that year he led a naval expedition against Germanic tribes along the North Sea coast, conquering the Batavi and the Frisii, and defeating the Chauci near the mouth of the Weser. In 11 BC, he conquered the Usipetes and the Marsi, extending Roman control to the Upper Weser. In 10 BC, he launched a campaign against the Chatti and the resurgent Sicambri, subjugating both. The following year, while serving as consul, he conquered the Mattiaci and defeated the Marcomanni and the Cherusci, the latter near the Elbe. His Germanic campaigns were cut short in the summer of 9 BC by his death after a riding accident.

Drusus was a very able commander. His death slowed the northward expansion of the Roman Empire, and foreshadowed the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. He was enormously popular among his men, who erected the Drususstein in his honor; his memory was elevated during the reign of his son Claudius. Drusus&#x27; accomplishments in battle were considerable. He fought numerous Germanic chiefs in single combat, and was likely the fourth and final Roman to achieve the &quot;spolia opima&quot; (for taking the armor and weapons of an enemy king after defeating them in single combat), though he died before he could be honored for it.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Drusus was the youngest son of Livia Drusilla from her marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero, who was legally declared his father before the couple divorced. Drusus was born between mid-March and mid-April 38 BC, three months after Livia married Augustus on 17 January. Gerhard Radke has proposed the date of 28 March as his most likely birthday, while Lindsay Powell interprets Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Fasti&quot; as indicating a date of 13 January. Rumors arose that Augustus was the child&#x27;s real father, although impossible as Livia was already pregnant when she met her future husband (Emperor Claudius nonetheless encouraged the rumor during his reign to create an impression of more direct lineage from Augustus).

Drusus was raised in Claudius Nero&#x27;s house with his brother, the future emperor Tiberius, until his legal father&#x27;s death. The two brothers developed a famously close relationship that would last the rest of their lives. Tiberius named his eldest son after his brother, although eldest sons were usually named after their father or grandfather. Drusus named his second son (future emperor Claudius) after Tiberius.

===Name===

According to Suetonius, Drusus was originally given the name &quot;Decimus&quot; as his praenomen, but his full name was later changed to &quot;Nero Claudius Drusus&quot;. It is not known when or why the change occurred. The names were unusual at the time, both putting heavy emphasis on his maternal ancestry by using Livia&#x27;s father&#x27;s cognomen instead of that of her husband; in his original name the use of the praenomen Decimus was also atypical for prevalent families of the late Republic (especially for a patrician). The eventual use of his father&#x27;s cognomen Nero as a praenomen was highly unconventional as well. His full name given at his &quot;Dies lustricus&quot; is generally assumed to have been &quot;Decimus Claudius Drusus&quot;, but some historians such as Andrew Pettinger, Pierre Grimal, T. P. Wiseman, Greg Rowe, Barbara Levick and Eric D. Huntsman believe it may have been &quot;Decimus Claudius Nero&quot;, &quot;Decimus Claudius Nero Drusus&quot; or &quot;Decimus Claudius Drusus Nero&quot; instead.

Livia may have passed down her father&#x27;s cognomen to her son simply because, besides her adoptive brother Marcus Livius Drusus Libo, there was no one else to pass it down for the future. In 1988 C.J. Simpson asserted that there are three moments in history where the name change is probable to have happened; when his brother Tiberius was adopted by Marcus Gallius, when their father died in 33 BC, or when he assumed the toga virilis. Simpson personally argued against the time of adoption of his brother as a plausible time for his name change since Simpson believed the event may even have happened before Drusus was born; he also rejected the point of death of their father as likely since it would have probably have brought attention to the circumstances surrounding Livia&#x27;s divorce and remarriage, which had become a part of Mark Antony&#x27;s propaganda at the time. Simpson stated that in his opinion Livia chose the names Decimus and Drusus for her younger son to minimize association with her ex-husband after she married Octavian due to the former&#x27;s poor status at the time, but that several years after the man&#x27;s death it was opportune to emphasize her younger son&#x27;s connection with his elder brother and that the name change was probably done upon him assuming the toga virilis. Levick believed the adoption of Tiberius necessitated Drusus wearing the name of the Nerones. Simpson responded 1993 in that he believes that Levick&#x27;s interpretation is incompatible with Suetonius account as he cannot accept that Livia and Octavian (once married) would have allowed the adoption of the boy to take place at all, due to Gallius opposition of Octavian. Since Seutonius makes it clear that Tiberius did use Gallius name (although briefly) but dropped it out of respect for his step-father the adoption must have happened before Drusus was born.

Jean Mottershead proposed in her commentary of Suetonius&#x27;s &quot;Divus Claudius&quot; that Drusus&#x27; &quot;praenomen&quot; derived from his father&#x27;s maternal side of the family, possibly the Junii or Laelii as they were the only senatorial families who regularly used the praenomen &quot;Decimus&quot;. She also believes that the name change happened when his father died and he moved into Octavian&#x27;s household. Klaus Scherberich is critical of Mottershead&#x27;s proposal, he argues that there are no examples of a conservative patrician family like the Claudii Nerones adopting a completely new praenomen from a maternal ancestor, especially when said gentes were non-patrician. Scherberich is also sceptical of Simpson&#x27;s explanation.

Lindsay Powell believes that Drusus personally (despite his young age) may have changed his name directly after his father&#x27;s death to preserve and honor his memory. In his opinion another motivation for the boy may have been the meaning of the name &quot;Nero&quot;, which in ancient Sabine (the language of the people which the Claudii descended from) meant &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;valiant&quot;, a fitting name for a boy from such a distinguished clan.

== Marriage ==

Drusus married Antonia Minor, the daughter of Mark Antony and Augustus&#x27; sister, Octavia Minor, and gained a reputation of being completely faithful to her. Their children were Germanicus, Claudius, a daughter named Livilla (&#x27;little Livia&#x27;), and at least two others who did not survive childhood. After Drusus&#x27; death, Antonia never remarried, though she outlived him by nearly five decades. Three emperors were direct descendants of Drusus: his son Claudius, his grandson Caligula, and his great-grandson Nero.

==Career==
Augustus bestowed many honors on his stepsons. In 19 BC, Drusus was granted the ability to hold all public offices five years before the minimum age. When Tiberius left Italy during his term as praetor in 16 BC, Drusus legislated in his place. He became quaestor the following year, fighting against Raetian bandits in the Alps. Drusus repelled them, gaining honors, but was unable to smash their forces, and required reinforcement from Tiberius. The brothers easily defeated the local Alpine tribes.

Drusus arrived in Gaul in late 15 BC to serve as &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot; (governor on Augustus&#x27; behalf with the authority of a praetor) of the three Gaulish provinces. His contribution to the ongoing building and urban development in Gaul can be seen in the establishment of the &quot;pes Drusianus&quot;, or ‘Drusian foot’, of about , which was in use in Samarobriva (modern Amiens) and among the Tungri. From 14 to 13 BC, Augustus himself was also active in Gaul, whether in Lugdunum (modern Lyon) or along the Rhine frontier.

As governor of Gaul, Drusus made his headquarters at Lugdunum, where he decided to establish the &quot;concilium Galliarum&quot; or ‘council of the Gaulish provinces’ sometime between 14 and 12 BC. This council would elect from its members a priest to celebrate games and venerate Rome and Augustus as deities every 1 August at the altar of the three Gauls that Drusus established at Condate in 10 BC. Drusus&#x27; son Tiberius—the future emperor Claudius—was born in Lugdunum on the same day that this altar was inaugurated.

===Germanic campaigns===

Starting in 14 BC, Drusus built a string of military bases along the Rhine—fifty according to Florus—and established an alliance with the Batavi in preparation for military action in Germania Libera. He is likely to have had seven legions under his command. In spring of 12 BC, he embarked an expeditionary force, perhaps consisting of the Legiones I Germanica and V Alaudae, by ship from the vicinity of modern Nijmegen, making use of one or more canals he had built for the purpose. Drusus sailed to the mouth of the Ems and penetrated into the territory of the Chauci in present-day Lower Saxony. The Chauci concluded a treaty acknowledging Roman supremacy, and would remain allies of Rome for years to come. As they continued to ascend the Ems, the Romans were attacked by the Bructeri in boats. Drusus&#x27; forces defeated the Bructeri, but, as it was now late in the campaign season, turned back for their winter quarters in Gaul, taking advantage of their new alliance with the Frisii to navigate through the difficult conditions on the North Sea.

As a reward for the successes of his campaign in 12 BC, Drusus was made &quot;praetor urbanus&quot; for 11 BC when he returned to Rome for the winter. News of Drusus&#x27; achievementsnavigating the North Sea, carrying the Roman eagles into new territory, and fixing new peoples into treaty relations with Romecaused considerable excitement in Rome and were commemorated on coins.

In the spring of his term as &quot;praetor urbanus&quot;, he set out for the German border once more. This time, he assembled a force consisting of all or part of five legions in addition to auxiliaries and, setting out from Vetera on the Rhine, ascended the River Lippe. Here he encountered the Tencteri and Usipetes, whom he defeated in two separate engagements. He reached the Werra Valley before deciding to turn back for the season, as winter was coming on, supplies were dwindling, and the omens were unfavorable. While his forces were making their way back through the territory of the Cherusci, the latter tribe laid an ambush for them at Arbalo. The Cherusci failed to capitalize on their initial advantage, whereupon the Romans broke through their lines, defeated the Germanic attackers, and acclaimed Drusus as &quot;imperator&quot;. To show his continued mastery of the ground, Drusus garrisoned a number of positions within Germania during the winter of 11–10 BC, including one somewhere in Hesse and one in Cheruscan territory, probably either the camp at Haltern or that at Bergkamen-Oberaden, both in present-day North Rhine–Westphalia.

He rejoined his wife Antonia and two children for a time in Lugdunum before the family returned to Rome, where Drusus reported to Augustus. Drusus was given the honor of an ovation, and for the third time, Augustus closed the doors of the Temple of Janus, signifying that the whole Roman world was then at peace.
Drusus was granted the office of proconsul for the following year. In 10 BC, the Chatti joined with the Sicambri and attacked Drusus&#x27; camp, but they were driven back. Drusus pursued them, proceeding from the sites of present-day Mainz and Rödgen, where he set up a base of supply, to Hedemünden, where a strong new camp was established. Around this time, the canny Marcomannic king Maroboduus responded to the Roman incursion by relocating his people &quot;en masse&quot; to Bohemia. In summer of 10 BC, Drusus left the field in order to return to Lugdunum, where he inaugurated the sanctuary of the Three Gaulish provinces at Condate on 1 August. Augustus and Tiberius were in Lugdunum for this occasion (when Drusus&#x27; youngest son Claudius was born), and afterwards Drusus accompanied them back to Rome.

Drusus easily won election as consul for the year 9 BC. Once more he left the city before assuming office. His consulship conferred the chance for Drusus to attain Rome&#x27;s highest and rarest military honor, the &quot;spolia opima&quot;, or spoils of an enemy chieftain slain personally by an opposing Roman general who was fighting (as consuls did) under his own auspices. He quickly returned to the field, stopping to confer with his staff at Lugdunum and to dedicate a temple to Caesar Augustus at Andemantunnum, before rejoining his command at Mainz, from which the year&#x27;s expedition departed in early spring. Drusus led the army via Rödgen through the territories of the Marsi and Cherusci until he even crossed the river Elbe. Here he is said to have seen an apparition of a Germanic woman who warned him against proceeding farther and that his death was near. Drusus turned back, erecting a trophy to commemorate his reaching the Elbe, perhaps on the site of Dresden or Magdeburg.

Drusus had sought out multiple Germanic (at least three) chieftains during his campaigns in Germany (12 BC–9 BC), engaging them in &quot;dazzling displays of single combat&quot;. The sources are ambiguous, but suggest that he could have potentially taken the &quot;spolia opima&quot; from a Germanic king, thus becoming the fourth and final Roman to gain this honor. Regardless of whether he was actually able to take them in combat, however, Drusus&#x27; untimely death would prevent him from ever going through with the official ceremony. Notably, after Drusus&#x27; death, Augustus deposited the laurels from his &quot;fasces&quot; not in the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus as he had done in the past, but in the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius. J.W. Rich suggests that this action was done as an affirmation to Drusus&#x27; memory; had the young commander lived, he would have placed &quot;spolia opima&quot; in the temple himself.

==Death and legacy==
Drusus was returning from his advance to the Elbe when he fell from his horse, by which point Tiberius had joined him. Though he survived the initial accident, infection set in, and he died about a month later. Shortly before his death he wrote a letter to Tiberius complaining about the style in which Augustus ruled and discussed forcing him to restore the republic. Suetonius reports that he had refused to return to Rome just before his death. Drusus&#x27; body was brought back to the city, and his ashes were deposited in the Mausoleum of Augustus. He remained extremely popular with the legionaries, who erected a monument (the Drususstein) in &quot;Mogontiacum&quot; (modern Mainz) on his behalf. Remnants of this are still standing.

The Senate raised an arch on the Appian Way in his memory (unrelated to the Arch of Drusus) which read &quot;DE GERM&quot; and depicted his Elbe trophy as well as him fighting on horseback, a testament to his personal bravery. They also posthumously granted him the hereditary honorific title &quot;Germanicus&quot;, which was given to his eldest son before passing to his youngest. It would be used by many members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, including its last three emperors: his grandson Caligula, his son Claudius, and his great-grandson Nero. Augustus later wrote a biography of him which does not survive. By Augustus&#x27; decree, festivals were held in Mogontiacum at Drusus&#x27; death day and probably also on his birthday.

Drusus&#x27; mother Livia, much affected by the death of her second son, took the advice of the philosopher Areus to put up many statues and images of Drusus and speak often about him. The surviving Latin work &quot;Consolatio ad Liviam&quot; is framed as an Ovidian message of consolation to Livia on this occasion, though it is generally considered a literary exercise &quot;composed between the death of Livia [AD 29] and that of Tiberius [AD 37]&quot;.

Augustus noted the successes of Drusus&#x27; campaigns—for which, as Drusus&#x27; superior, he took credit—in his &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot;, written in 14 AD:

Upon Claudius&#x27; accession to the principate in 41 AD, his late father Drusus received new public honors, including annual games in the Circus Maximus on 14 January for Drusus&#x27; birthday, coin issues depicting Drusus&#x27; likeness and his commemorative arch, and the restoration of a monument near the Ara Pacis Augustae that featured a statue of Drusus. Claudius also completed a road from Italy into Raetia that followed the route Drusus had taken and whose road-markers commemorated Drusus&#x27; achievements in the Alpine war. Such Claudian commemorations of Drusus&#x27; memory are thought to have become less prominent once Claudius had his own British triumph to celebrate.

Historian Michael McNally considers Drusus to have been the most able of the various Roman commanders who attempted to conquer Germania, as well as the most successful. While the furthest extent of territorial gains would be realized the year after his death, under Tiberius, Drusus&#x27; death marked a slowing of Roman expansion. Drusus&#x27; successors would prove unfit for the task of conquering Germania, with disastrous results. Drusus was succeeded as commander in Germania by Tiberius, but Tiberius fell out of imperial favor, and chose self exile in 6 BC. Command then fell to Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus. Ahenobarbus was partly successful, becoming the first and last Roman general to cross the Elbe river, but was generally bogged down in suppressing revolts. Command then fell to Publius Quinctilius Varus, under whom the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (also called the Varian disaster) would occur. The destruction of Varus&#x27; entire army marked the end of northward Roman expansion. The Rhine became the de facto border of the Roman empire, rendering moot much of Drusus&#x27; life work.

<text>Livia Drusilla (30 January 59 BC
AD 29) was Roman empress from 27 BC to AD 14 as the wife of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. She was known as Julia Augusta after her formal adoption into the Julia &quot;gens&quot; in AD 14.

Livia was the daughter of senator Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus and his wife Alfidia. She married Tiberius Claudius Nero around 43 BC, and they had two sons, Tiberius and Drusus. In 38 BC, she divorced Tiberius Claudius Nero and married the political leader Octavian. The Senate granted Octavian the title &quot;Augustus&quot; in 27 BC, effectively making him emperor. In her role as Roman empress, Livia served as an influential confidant to her husband and was rumored to have been responsible for the deaths of several of his relatives, including his grandson Agrippa Postumus.

After Augustus died in AD 14, Tiberius was elevated, and Livia continued to exert political influence as the mother of the emperor until her death in AD 29. She was grandmother of the emperor Claudius, great-grandmother of the emperor Caligula, and great-great-grandmother of the emperor Nero. Livia was deified by Claudius in AD 42, bestowing her the title &quot;Diva Augusta&quot;.

==Birth and first marriage to Tiberius Claudius Nero==

Livia Drusilla was born on 30 January 59 BC as the daughter of Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus by his wife Alfidia. The diminutive &quot;Drusilla&quot; often found in her name suggests that she was not her father&#x27;s first daughter. She may have had a brother named Gaius Livius Drusus who had two daughters named Livia Pulchra and Livilla. Her father also adopted Marcus Livius Drusus Libo.

She was married around 43 BC to Tiberius Claudius Nero, her cousin of patrician status who was fighting with her father on the side of Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassins against Octavian. Her father committed suicide in the Battle of Philippi, along with Gaius Cassius Longinus and Marcus Junius Brutus, but her husband continued fighting against Octavian, now on behalf of Mark Antony and his brother Lucius Antonius. Her first child, the future emperor Tiberius, was born in 42 BC. In 40 BC, the family was forced to flee Italy in order to avoid the recriminations of Octavian in the aftermath of the siege of Perusia. They joined with Sextus Pompeius, a son of Pompey Magnus, who opposed the Second Triumvirate from his base in Sicily. Later, Livia, her husband Tiberius Nero and their two-year-old son, Tiberius, moved on to Greece.

==Wife to Augustus==
After peace was established between the Triumvirate and the followers of Sextus Pompeius, a general amnesty was announced, and Livia returned to Rome, where she was personally introduced to Octavian in 39 BC. At this time, Livia already had a son, the future emperor Tiberius, and was pregnant with the second, Nero Claudius Drusus (also known as Drusus the Elder). Legend said that Octavian fell immediately in love with her, despite the fact that he was still married to Scribonia. Octavian divorced Scribonia on 30 October 39 BC, the very day Scribonia gave birth to his only biological child, daughter Julia the Elder. 

Seemingly around that time, when Livia was six months pregnant with her second child, Tiberius Claudius Nero was persuaded or forced by Octavian to divorce Livia. She gave birth on 14 January; three days later Octavian married Livia after waiving the traditional waiting period. On the day of his wedding to Livia, Octavian received a supposed omen of an eagle dropping a white hen with a laurel branch in its mouth into Livia&#x27;s lap. This omen was interpreted as being an indication toward Livia&#x27;s fertility, as she had given birth to two sons in her short two years of marriage to Nero. This was ironic because her first pregnancy by Augustus ended in a stillbirth, and she was unable to ever conceive another child. Tiberius Claudius Nero was present at the wedding, giving her in marriage &quot;just as a father would.&quot; The importance of the patrician Claudii to Octavian&#x27;s cause, and the political survival of the Claudii Nerones are probably more rational explanations for the tempestuous union. Nevertheless, Livia and Augustus remained married for the next 51 years, despite the fact that they had no children apart from the single stillbirth. She always enjoyed the status of privileged counselor to her husband, petitioning him on the behalf of others and influencing his policies, an unusual role for a Roman wife in a culture dominated by the pater familias.
After Mark Antony&#x27;s suicide following the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, Octavian returned to Rome triumphant; on 16 January 27 BC, the Senate bestowed upon him the honorary title of &quot;Augustus&quot; (&quot;honorable&quot; or &quot;revered one&quot;). Augustus rejected monarchical titles, instead choosing to refer to himself as &quot;Princeps Civitatis&quot; (&quot;First Citizen of the State&quot;) or &quot;Princeps Senatus&quot; (&quot;First among the Senate&quot;). He and Livia formed the role model for Roman households. Despite their wealth and power, Augustus&#x27; family continued to live modestly in their house on the Palatine Hill. Livia would set the pattern for the noble Roman &quot;matrona&quot;. She wore neither excessive jewelry nor pretentious costumes; she took care of the household and her husband (often making his clothes herself), always faithful and dedicated. In 35 BC, Octavian gave Livia the unprecedented honor of ruling her own finances and dedicated a public statue to her. She owned and effectively administered copper mines in Gaul, estates of palm groves in Judea, and dozens of papyrus marshes in Egypt. She had her own circle of clients and pushed many protégés into political offices, including the grandfathers of the later emperors Galba and Otho.

With Augustus being the father of only one daughter (Julia by Scribonia), Livia revealed herself to be an ambitious mother and soon started to push her own sons, Tiberius and Drusus, into power. Drusus was a trusted general and married Augustus&#x27; favorite niece, Antonia Minor, having three children: the popular general Germanicus, Livilla, and the future emperor Claudius. Drusus was killed in a riding accident only a few years later, dying in 9 BC. This was also the same year in which Livia was honored by the dedication of the Ara Pacis Augustae as a birthday present. Tiberius married Augustus&#x27; daughter Julia in 11 BC and was ultimately adopted as Augustus&#x27; heir in AD 4.

Rumor had it that Livia was behind the death of Augustus&#x27; nephew Marcellus in 23 BC. After Julia&#x27;s two elder sons by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, whom Augustus had adopted as sons and successors, had died, the one remaining son, Agrippa Postumus, was adopted at the same time as Tiberius, but later Agrippa Postumus was sent into exile and finally killed. Tacitus charges that Livia was not altogether innocent of these deaths and Cassius Dio also mentions such rumours. There are also rumors mentioned by Tacitus and Cassius Dio that Livia brought about Augustus&#x27; death by poisoning fresh figs, although modern historians view this as unlikely. Augustus&#x27; granddaughter was Julia the Younger. Sometime between AD 1 and 14, her husband Lucius Aemilius Paullus was executed as a conspirator in a revolt. Modern historians theorize that Julia&#x27;s exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus&#x27; revolt. Tacitus alleged that Livia had plotted against her stepdaughter&#x27;s family and ruined them. Julia died in AD 29 on the island to which she had been sent in exile twenty years earlier.

== Reign of Tiberius ==

Augustus died on 19 August AD 14, being deified by the senate shortly afterward. In his will, he left one third of his property to Livia, and the other two thirds to Tiberius. In the will, he also adopted her into the Julian family and granted her the honorific title of &quot;Augusta&quot;. These dispositions permitted Livia to maintain her status and power after her husband&#x27;s death, under the new name of Julia Augusta. Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that rumours persisted that Augustus was poisoned by Livia, but these are mainly dismissed as malicious fabrications spread by political enemies of the dynasty. The most famous of these rumors was that Livia, unable to poison his food in the kitchens because Augustus insisted on only eating figs picked fresh from his garden, smeared each fruit with poison while still on the tree to preempt him. In Imperial times, a variety of fig cultivated in Roman gardens was called the &quot;Liviana&quot;, perhaps because of her reputed horticultural abilities, or as a tongue-in-cheek reference to this rumor.
For some time, Livia and her son Tiberius, the new emperor, appeared to get along with each other. Speaking against her became treason in AD 20, and in AD 24 he granted his mother a theater seat among the Vestal Virgins. Livia exercised unofficial but very real power in Rome. Eventually, Tiberius became resentful of his mother&#x27;s political status, particularly against the idea that it was she who had given him the throne. At the beginning of his reign Tiberius vetoed the unprecedented title &quot;Mater Patriae&quot; (&quot;Mother of the Fatherland&quot;) that the Senate wished to bestow upon her, in the same manner in which Augustus had been named &quot;Pater Patriae&quot; (&quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot;) (Tiberius also consistently refused the title of &quot;Pater Patriae&quot; for himself).
The historians Tacitus and Cassius Dio depict an overweening, even domineering dowager, ready to interfere in Tiberius’ decisions. The most notable instances were the cases of Urgulania, grandmother of Claudius&#x27;s first wife Plautia Urgulanilla, who correctly assumed that her friendship with the empress placed her above the law; and Munatia Plancina, suspected of murdering Germanicus and saved at Livia&#x27;s entreaty. (Plancina committed suicide in AD 33 after being accused again of murder after Livia&#x27;s death.) A notice from AD 22 records that Julia Augusta (Livia) dedicated a statue to Augustus in the center of Rome, placing her own name even before that of Tiberius.

Ancient historians give as a reason for Tiberius&#x27; retirement to Capri his inability to endure his mother any longer. Until AD 22 there had, according to Tacitus, been &quot;a genuine harmony between mother and son, or a hatred well concealed;&quot; Dio tells us that at the time of his accession already Tiberius heartily loathed her.

==Death and Aftermath==

In AD 22 she had fallen ill, and Tiberius hastened back to Rome in order to be with her. But in AD 29 when she finally fell ill and died, he remained on Capri, pleading pressure of work and sending Caligula to deliver the funeral oration. Suetonius adds the macabre detail that &quot;when she died... after a delay of several days, during which he held out hope of his coming, [she was at last] buried because the condition of the corpse made it necessary...&quot;. Divine honors he also vetoed, stating that this was in accord with her own instructions. Later he vetoed all the honors the Senate had granted her after her death and cancelled the fulfillment of her will.

It was not until 13 years later, in AD 42 during the reign of her grandson Claudius, that all her honors were restored and her deification finally completed. She was named &quot;Diva Augusta&quot; (&quot;The Divine Augusta&quot;), and an elephant-drawn chariot conveyed her image to all public games. A statue of her was set up in the Temple of Augustus along with her husband&#x27;s, races were held in her honor, and women were to invoke her name in their sacred oaths. Her and Augustus&#x27; tomb was later sacked at an unknown date.

Her Villa ad Gallinas Albas north of Rome is currently being excavated; its famous frescoes of imaginary garden views may be seen at the National Roman Museum. One of the most famous statues of Augustus (the Augustus of Prima Porta) came from the grounds of the villa.

==Personality==
While reporting various unsavory hearsay, the ancient sources generally portray Livia as a woman of proud and queenly attributes, faithful to her imperial husband. Dio records two of her utterances: &quot;Once, when some naked men met her and were to be put to death in consequence, she saved their lives by saying that to a chaste woman such men are in no way different from statues. When someone asked her how she had gained respect from Augustus, she answered that it was by being scrupulously chaste herself, doing gladly whatever pleased him, not meddling with any of his affairs, and, in particular, by pretending neither to hear nor to notice the favourites of his passion.&quot;

With the passage of time, however, some thought that with widowhood a haughtiness and an overt craving for power and the outward trappings of status came increasingly to the fore. Livia had always been a principal beneficiary of the climate of adulation that Augustus had done so much to create, and which Tiberius despised (&quot;a strong contempt for honours&quot;, Tacitus, &quot;Annals&quot; 4.37). In AD 24, whenever she attended the theatre, a seat among the Vestals was typically reserved for her (&quot;Annals&quot; 4.16), but this may have been intended more as an honor for the Vestals than for her (cf. Ovid, &quot;Tristia&quot;, 4.2.13f, &quot;Epist. ex Ponto&quot; 4.13.29f).

Livia played a vital role in the formation of her children Tiberius and Drusus. Attention focuses on her part in the divorce of her first husband, father of Tiberius, in 39/38 BC. Her role in this is unknown, as well as in Tiberius&#x27;s divorce of Vipsania Agrippina in 12 BC at Augustus&#x27;s insistence: whether it was merely neutral or passive, or whether she actively colluded in Caesar&#x27;s wishes.

==Legacy==
The Roman tribe Livia was named in her honor.

==In literature and popular culture==
===In ancient literature===

The ancient sources all agree that Livia was Augustus&#x27; best confidant and counselor, but the extent of her influence remained disputed due to the numerous attempts by her political enemies to defame her dynasty. According to Suetonius, who had access to imperial records, Augustus would write down lists of items to be discussed with Livia, and then take careful notes of her replies to be consulted again later.

In Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Annals&quot;, meanwhile, Livia is famously depicted as having great influence, to the extent where she &quot;had the aged Augustus firmly under control—so much so that he exiled his only surviving grandson to the island of Planasia&quot;; Tacitus goes on to call her &quot;a real catastrophe to the nation as a mother, and to the house of the Caesars as a stepmother&quot; and &quot;a compliant wife, but an overbearing mother&quot;.

Livia&#x27;s image appears in ancient visual media such as coins and portraits. Following Octavia the Younger, Cleopatra and possibly Fulvia, she was the third (or fourth) woman to appear on provincial coins in 16 BC. On official Roman coinage, she was probably portrayed as Salus Augusta on the dupondius of Tiberius. Her portrait images can be chronologically identified partially from the progression of her hair designs, which represented more than keeping up with the fashions of the time as her depiction with such contemporary details translated into a political statement of representing the ideal Roman woman. Livia&#x27;s image evolves with different styles of portraiture that trace her effect on imperial propaganda that helped bridge the gap between her role as wife to the emperor Augustus, to mother of the emperor Tiberius. Becoming more than the &quot;beautiful woman&quot; she is described as in ancient texts, Livia serves as a public image for the idealization of Roman feminine qualities, a motherly figure, and eventually a goddesslike representation that alludes to her virtue. Livia&#x27;s power in symbolizing the renewal of the Republic with the female virtues &quot;Pietas&quot; and &quot;Concordia&quot; in public displays had a dramatic effect on the visual representation of future imperial women as ideal, honorable mothers and wives of Rome. Livia also restored the temple of the &quot;Bona Dea.&quot;

Livia is mentioned by Pliny the Elder, who describes the vines of the Pulcino wine (&quot;Vinum Pucinum&quot; - today at best &quot;Prosecco&quot;). This then special and rare wine from the sunny slopes northeast of Barcola in the direction of the place Prosecco or Duino (near the historic place Castellum Pucinum) was according to Pliny the favorite wine of the Empress Livia. She is said to have loved this Vinum Pucinum for its medicinal properties and at the end of her long life (she was 87) she attributed her old age to its consumption and commended it to everyone as an &quot;elixir for a long life&quot;.

===In modern literature===
In the popular fictional work &quot;I, Claudius&quot; by Robert Graves—based on Tacitus&#x27; innuendo—Livia is portrayed as a thoroughly Machiavellian, scheming political mastermind. Determined never to allow republican governance to flower again, as she felt they led to corruption and civil war, and devoted to bringing Tiberius to power and then maintaining him there, she is involved in nearly every death or disgrace in the Julio-Claudian family up to the time of her death. On her deathbed she only fears divine punishment for all she had done, and secures the promise of future deification by her grandson Claudius, an act which, she believes, will guarantee her a blissful afterlife. However, this portrait of her is balanced by her intense devotion to the well-being of the Empire as a whole, and her machinations are justified as a necessarily cruel means to what she firmly considers a noble aspiration: the common good of the Romans, achievable only under strict imperial rule.
In John Maddox Roberts&#x27;s short story &quot;The King of Sacrifices,&quot; set in his SPQR series, Livia hires Decius Metellus to investigate the murder of one of Julia the Elder&#x27;s lovers. 
In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; by Colleen McCullough, Livia is portrayed as a cunning and effective advisor to her husband, whom she loves passionately.
Luke Devenish&#x27;s &quot;Empress of Rome&quot; novels, &quot;Den of Wolves&quot; (2008) and &quot;Nest of Vipers&quot; (2010), have Livia as a central character in a fictionalized account of her life and times.
Livia plays an important role in two Marcus Corvinus mysteries by David Wishart, &quot;Ovid&quot; (1995) and &quot;Germanicus&quot; (1997). She is mentioned posthumously in &quot;Sejanus&quot; (1998).

===On television and film===
* In the 1968 ITV television series &quot;The Caesars&quot;, Livia was played by Sonia Dresdel.
* In the 1976 BBC television series I, Claudius based on the book, Livia was played by Siân Phillips. Phillips won a BAFTA for her portrayal of the role.
* In the 2003 television film , (one of a series), Livia was portrayed by Charlotte Rampling.
* In the 2007 HBO/BBC television series &quot;Rome&quot;, Livia was dramatized by Alice Henley.

The 2021 Sky Atlantic series &quot;Domina&quot; relates the rise of the Roman Principate with a focus on Livia&#x27;s role and relationships. She is portrayed as having sworn a sacred oath to her father&#x27;s shade to restore the Republic and to be playing a long con to that effect in concert with Gn. Calpurnius Piso. The child Livia is played by Meadow Nobrega, the adolescent and young adult Livia by Nadia Parkes, and the adult Livia by Kasia Smutniak.

==Descendants==
Her marriage with Augustus produced only one pregnancy, which miscarried. However, through her sons by her first husband, Tiberius and Drusus, she was a direct ancestor of all of the Julio-Claudian emperors as well as most of the extended Julio-Claudian imperial family.

<doc id="74778" wikidata="Q229836" url="?curid=74778" title="Antonia Minor">
<text>Antonia Minor (31 January 36 BC – 1 May 37 AD) was the younger of two surviving daughters of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor. She was a niece of the Emperor Augustus, sister-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, paternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger, mother of the Emperor Claudius, and maternal great-grandmother of the Emperor Nero. She outlived her husband Drusus, her oldest son, her daughter, and several of her grandchildren.

==Biography==
===Birth and early life===
She was born in Athens, and after 36 BC was taken to Rome by her mother with her siblings. She was the youngest of five. Her mother had three children, named Claudia Marcella Major, Claudia Marcella Minor, and Marcus Claudius Marcellus, from her first marriage and another daughter, named Antonia Major, by the same father (Mark Antony). Antonia never knew her father; Mark Antony divorced her mother in 32 BC and committed suicide in 30 BC.

She was raised by her mother, her uncle, and her aunt, Livia Drusilla and inherited properties in Italy, Greece, and Egypt. She was said to have received visitors to her house, such as Valerius Asiaticus and Lucius Vitellius, a consul and the father of the future emperor Aulus Vitellius.

===Marriage and family===
In 16 BC, she married the Roman general and future consul (9 BC) Nero Claudius Drusus. Drusus was the stepson of her uncle Augustus, second son of Livia Drusilla, and brother of future Emperor Tiberius. They had many children, but only three survived: the famous general Germanicus, Livilla, and the Roman Emperor Claudius.

A poem by Crinagoras of Mytilene mentions Antonia&#x27;s first pregnancy, which may be of a child before Germanicus who must have died in infancy or early childhood.

Drusus died in June 9 BC in Germany, due to complications from injuries he sustained after falling from a horse. After his death, although pressured by her uncle to remarry, she never did.

Antonia raised her children in Rome. Tiberius adopted Germanicus in 4 AD. Germanicus died in 19 AD, allegedly poisoned through the handiwork of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso and Munatia Plancina. Tacitus suggests but does not outright say in &quot;Annals&quot; 3.3 that, on the orders of Tiberius and Livia Drusilla, Antonia was forbidden to go to his funeral. When Livia Drusilla died in June of 29 AD, Antonia took care of her younger grandchildren Caligula, Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, Julia Livilla, and later Claudia Antonia.

===Conflict with Livilla===
In 31 AD, a plot by her daughter Livilla and Tiberius’ notorious Praetorian prefect, Sejanus, to murder the Emperor Tiberius and Caligula and to seize the throne for themselves, was exposed by Apicata, the estranged ex-wife of Sejanus. Livilla allegedly poisoned her husband, Tiberius&#x27; son, Drusus Julius Caesar (nicknamed &quot;Castor&quot;), in 23 AD to remove him as a rival.

Sejanus was executed before Livilla was implicated in the crime. After Apicata&#x27;s accusation, which came in the form of a letter to the emperor, several co-conspirators were executed while Livilla was handed over to her mother for punishment. Cassius Dio states that Antonia imprisoned Livilla in her room until she starved to death.

===Succession of Caligula and death===
When Tiberius died, Caligula became emperor in March 37 AD. Caligula awarded her a senatorial decree, granting her all the honors that Livia Drusilla had received in her lifetime. She was also offered the title of &quot;Augusta&quot;, previously only given to Augustus&#x27;s wife Livia, but rejected it.

Antonia died on 1 May 37. Suetonius and Cassius Dio claim she was driven to suicide by Caligula. According to Barrett, But since he had not reached Rome until 28 March, and was absent from the city for much of April, collecting the remains of his mother and brother, there would hardly have been much time to drive Antonia to her death by insulting behaviour. It is also difficult to imagine that he would have paid her no honours on her death, as Suetonius implies. She died at a time when the euphoria of the beginning of his reign was still rampant, and quite apart from any question of personal affection, a public slight at this time to the most respected woman in Rome, whose death was marked in local Fasti, would have been politically unimaginable.

When Claudius became emperor after his nephew&#x27;s assassination in 41 AD, he gave his mother the title of &quot;Augusta&quot;. Her birthday became a public holiday, which had yearly games and public sacrifices held. An image of her was paraded in a carriage.

==Cultural depictions==

She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

Antonia is one of the main characters in the novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot;. In the 1976 television adaptation of the book she is portrayed by Margaret Tyzack. She is a loyal wife deeply in love with her husband Nero Claudius Drusus. However, she is unloving towards her son Claudius, whom she regards as a fool. Furthermore, after finding evidence that Livilla murdered her husband Drusus Julius Caesar and rightfully believing she was also poisoning her daughter for the same reason, she kills Livilla by locking her in her room until she starves to death. During the reign of Caligula she is so disgusted by the state of Rome that she commits suicide.

She is a leading character in the novel by Lindsey Davis, &quot;The Course of Honour&quot; (1997), where she guides and advises Claudius and his supporters.

In the 1968 ITV historical drama &quot;The Caesars&quot;, Antonia was indirectly mentioned by Tiberius (played by André Morell), who noted that Germanicus was a blood relative of Augustus on his mother&#x27;s [Antonia] side.

Colleen Dewhurst portrayed Antonia opposite Susan Sarandon as Livilla in the 1985 miniseries &quot;A.D.&quot;

Isabelle Connolly (adult) and Beau Gadsdon (child) portrayed Antonia in British-Italian historical drama television series &quot;Domina&quot; (2021).

<text>Super Audio CD (SACD) is an optical disc format for audio storage introduced in 1999. It was developed jointly by Sony and Philips Electronics and intended to be the successor to the compact disc (CD) format.

The SACD format allows multiple audio channels (i.e. surround sound or multichannel sound). It also provides a higher bit rate and longer playing time than a conventional CD.

An SACD is designed to be played on an SACD player. A hybrid SACD contains a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) layer and can also be played on a standard CD player.

== History ==

The Super Audio CD format was introduced in 1999, and is defined by the &quot;Scarlet Book&quot; standard document. Philips and Crest Digital partnered in May 2002 to develop and install the first SACD hybrid disc production line in the United States, with a production capacity of up to three million discs per year. SACD did not achieve the level of growth that compact discs enjoyed in the 1980s, and was not accepted by the mainstream market.

By 2007, SACD had failed to make a significant impact in the marketplace; consumers were increasingly downloading low-resolution music files over the internet rather than buying music on physical disc formats. A small and niche market for SACD has remained, serving the audiophile community.

== Content ==
By October 2009, record companies had published more than 6,000 SACD releases, slightly more than half of which were classical music. Jazz and popular music albums, mainly remastered previous releases, were the next two genres most represented.

Many popular artists have released some or all of their back catalog on SACD. Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973) sold over 800,000 copies by June 2004 in its SACD Surround Sound edition. The Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969), and Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;Avalon&quot; (1982), were released on SACD to take advantage of the format&#x27;s multi-channel capability. All three albums were remixed in 5.1 surround, and released as hybrid SACDs with a stereo mix on the standard CD layer.

Some popular artists have released new recordings on SACD. Sales figures for Sting&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Love&quot; (2003) album reached number one on SACD sales charts in four European countries in June 2004.

Between 2007 and 2008, the rock band Genesis re-released all of their studio albums across three SACD box sets. Each album in these sets contains both new stereo and 5.1 mixes. The original stereo mixes were not included. The US &amp; Canada versions do not use SACD but CD instead.

By August 2009 443 labels had released one or more SACDs. Instead of depending on major label support, some orchestras and artists have released SACDs on their own. For instance, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra started the Chicago Resound label to provide full and burgeoning support for high-resolution SACD hybrid discs, and the London Symphony Orchestra established their own &quot;LSO Live&quot; label.

Many SACD discs that were released from 2000 to 2005 are now out of print and available only on the used market. By 2009, the major record companies were no longer regularly releasing discs in the format, with new releases confined to the smaller labels.

== Technology ==

SACD discs have identical physical dimensions as standard compact discs. The areal density of the disc is the same as a DVD. There are three types of disc:

*Hybrid: Hybrid SACDs have a 4.7 GB SACD layer (the &quot;HD layer&quot;), as well as a CD (Red Book) audio layer readable by most conventional compact disc players.
*Single-layer: A disc with one 4.7 GB SACD layer.
*Dual-layer: A disc with two SACD layers, totaling 8.5 GB, and no CD layer. Dual-layer SACDs can store nearly twice as much data as a single-layer SACD. Like most dual-layer DVDs, the data spiral for the first layer is encoded from the inside out, and the second layer is encoded starting from the point where the first layer ends and ending at the innermost part of the disc. Unlike hybrid discs, both single- and dual-layer SACDs are incompatible with conventional CD players and cannot be played on them.

A stereo SACD recording has an uncompressed rate of 5.6 Mbit/s, four times the rate for Red Book CD stereo audio.

Commercial releases commonly include both surround sound (five full-range plus LFE multi-channel) and stereo (dual-channel) mixes on the SACD layer. Some reissues retain the mixes of earlier multi-channel formats (examples include the 1973 quadraphonic mix of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; and the 1957 three-channel stereo recording by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot;, reissued on SACD in 2001 and 2004 respectively).

=== Disc reading ===
Objective lenses in conventional CD players have a longer working distance, or focal length, than lenses designed for SACD players. In SACD-capable DVD, Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray players, the red DVD laser is used for reading SACDs. This means that when a hybrid SACD is placed into a conventional CD player, the infrared laser beam passes through the SACD layer and is reflected by the CD layer at the standard 1.2 mm distance, and the SACD layer is out of focus. When the same disc is placed into an SACD player, the red laser is reflected by the SACD layer (at 0.6 mm distance) before it can reach the CD layer. Conversely, if a conventional CD is placed into an SACD player, the laser will read the disc as a CD since there is no SACD layer.

=== Direct Stream Digital ===
SACD audio is stored in Direct Stream Digital (DSD) format using pulse-density modulation (PDM) where audio amplitude is determined by the varying proportion of 1s and 0s. This contrasts with compact disc and conventional computer audio systems using pulse-code modulation (PCM) where audio amplitude is determined by numbers encoded in the bit stream. Both modulations require neighboring samples to reconstruct the original waveform; the more neighboring samples, the lower the frequency that can be encoded.

DSD is 1-bit, has a sampling rate of 2.8224 MHz, and makes use of noise shaping quantization techniques in order to push 1-bit quantization noise up to inaudible ultrasonic frequencies. This gives the format a greater dynamic range and wider frequency response than the CD. The SACD format is capable of delivering a dynamic range of 120 dB from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and an extended frequency response up to 100 kHz, although most available players list an upper limit of 70–90 kHz, and practical limits reduce this to 50 kHz. Because of the nature of sigma-delta converters, DSD and PCM cannot be directly compared. DSD&#x27;s frequency response can be as high as 100 kHz, but frequencies that high compete with high levels of ultrasonic quantization noise. With appropriate low-pass filtering, a frequency response of 20 kHz can be achieved along with a dynamic range of nearly 120 dB, which is about the same dynamic range as PCM audio with a resolution of 20 bits.

=== Direct Stream Transfer ===

To reduce the space and bandwidth requirements of DSD, a lossless data compression method called Direct Stream Transfer (DST) is used. DST compression is compulsory for multi-channel regions and optional for stereo regions. It typically compresses by a factor of between two and three, allowing a disc to contain 80 minutes of both 2-channel and 5.1-channel sound.

Direct Stream Transfer compression was standardized as an amendment to the MPEG-4 Audio standard, ISO/IEC 14496-3:2001/Amd 6:2005 (Lossless coding of oversampled audio), in 2005. It contains the DSD and DST definitions as described in the Super Audio CD Specification. The MPEG-4 DST provides lossless coding of oversampled audio signals. Target applications of DST are archiving and storage of 1-bit oversampled audio signals and SA-CD.

A reference implementation of MPEG-4 DST was published as ISO/IEC 14496-5:2001/Amd.10:2007 in 2007.

=== Copy protection ===

SACD has several copy protection features at the physical level, which made the digital content of SACD discs difficult to copy until the jailbreak of the PlayStation 3. The content may be copyable without SACD quality by resorting to the analog hole, or ripping the conventional 700 MB layer on hybrid discs. Copy protection schemes include physical pit modulation and 80-bit encryption of the audio data, with a key encoded on a special area of the disc that is only readable by a licensed SACD device. The HD layer of an SACD disc cannot be played back on computer CD/DVD drives, and SACDs can only be manufactured at the disc replication facilities in Shizuoka and Salzburg. 

Nonetheless, very early versions of the PlayStation 3 with an SACD-compatible drive and appropriate firmware and certain Blu-ray players can use specialized software to extract a DSD copy of the HD stream.

== Sound quality ==
Sound quality parameters achievable by the Red Book CD-DA and SACD formats compared with the limits of human hearing are as follows:

; CD: Dynamic range: 90 dB; 120 dB (with shaped dither); frequency range: 20 Hz—20 kHz
; SACD: Dynamic range: 105 dB; frequency range: 20 Hz— 50 kHz
; Human hearing: Dynamic range: 120 dB; frequency range: 20 Hz—20 kHz (young person); 20 Hz—8–15 kHz (middle-aged adult)

In September 2007, the Audio Engineering Society published the results of a year-long trial, in which a range of subjects—including professional recording engineers—were asked to discern the difference between high-resolution audio sources (including SACD and DVD-Audio) and a compact disc audio (44.1 kHz/16 bit) conversion of the same source material under double-blind test conditions. Out of 554 trials, there were 276 correct answers, a 49.8% success rate corresponding almost exactly to the 50% that would have been expected by chance guessing alone. When the level of the signal was elevated by 14 dB or more, the test subjects were able to detect the higher noise floor of the CD-quality loop easily. The authors commented:

Following criticism that the original published results of the study were not sufficiently detailed, the AES published a list of the audio equipment and recordings used during the tests. Since the Meyer–Moran study in 2007, approximately 80 studies have been published on high-resolution audio, about half of which included blind tests. Joshua Reiss performed a meta-analysis on 20 of the published tests that included sufficient experimental detail and data. In a paper published in the July 2016 issue of the AES Journal, Reiss says that, although the individual tests had mixed results, and that the effect was &quot;small and difficult to detect,&quot; the overall result was that trained listeners could distinguish between high-resolution recordings and their CD equivalents under blind conditions: &quot;Overall, there was a small but statistically significant ability to discriminate between standard-quality audio (44.1 or 48 kHz, 16 bit) and high-resolution audio (beyond standard quality). When subjects were trained, the ability to discriminate was far more significant.&quot; Hiroshi Nittono pointed out that the results in Reiss&#x27;s paper showed that the ability to distinguish high-resolution audio from CD-quality audio was &quot;only slightly better than chance.&quot;

Contradictory results have been found when comparing DSD and high-resolution PCM formats. Double-blind listening tests in 2004 between DSD and 24-bit, 176.4 kHz PCM recordings reported that among test subjects no significant differences could be heard. DSD advocates and equipment manufacturers continue to assert an improvement in sound quality above PCM 24-bit 176.4 kHz. A 2003 study found that despite both formats&#x27; extended frequency responses, people could not distinguish audio with information above 21 kHz from audio without such high-frequency content. In a 2014 study, however, Marui et al. found that under double-blind conditions, listeners were able to distinguish between PCM (192 kHz/24 bits) and DSD (2.8 MHz) or DSD (5.6 MHz) recording formats, preferring the qualitative features of DSD, but could not discriminate between the two DSD formats.

== Playback hardware ==

The Sony SCD-1 player was introduced concurrently with the SACD format in 1999, at a price of approximately US$5,000. It weighed over and played two-channel SACDs and Red Book CDs only. Electronics manufacturers, including Onkyo, Denon, Marantz, Pioneer and Yamaha offer or offered SACD players. Sony has made in-car SACD players.

In order to play back SACD content digitally without any conversion, some players are able to offer an output carrying encrypted streams of DSD, either via IEEE 1394 or more commonly, HDMI.

SACD players are not permitted to offer an output carrying an unencrypted stream of DSD.

The first two generations of Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 game console were capable of reading SACD discs. Starting with the third generation (introduced October 2007), SACD playback was removed. All PlayStation 3 models, however, will play DSD Disc format. The PlayStation 3 was capable of converting multi-channel DSD to lossy 1.5 Mbit/s DTS for playback over S/PDIF using the 2.00 system software. The subsequent revision removed the feature.

Several brands have introduced (mostly high-end) Blu-ray Disc and Ultra HD Blu-ray players that can play SACD discs.

Unofficial playback of SACD disc images on a PC is possible through freeware audio player foobar2000 for Windows using an open source plug-in extension called SACDDecoder. macOS music software Audirvana also supports playback of SACD disc images.

<text>SACD, founded as Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques () on 7 March 1829, is a French collecting society, undertaking collective rights management for authors. The Society manages, promotes and protects the performance rights of theatrical, audiovisual or photographic works for their creators by collecting royalties and authorising performances. It&#x27;s also one of the main lobbies against &quot;droit d&#x27;auteur&quot; (copyright) changes and to protect the activities of collective rights management societies.

==History==

The SACD was founded in 1829 by French dramatist and miscellaneous writer Charles-Guillaume Étienne. The idea of society protecting the rights of the authors dates back to Beaumarchais, who founded his own organization in 1777.

==Current activities==

In 2006 the Society represented about 44,000 members in the performing arts and audiovisual sectors. The entire SACD repertoire currently comprises about 500,000 works, from the performing arts and the audiovisual sector.

The SACD lobbies in favor of governmental action meant to discourage unauthorized use of copyrighted works over the Internet (DADVSI, HADOPI) and against proposals to establish a &quot;global license&quot;, authorizing French Internet users to copy copyrighted works in exchange for a flat fee on the Internet subscription.

In 2009, the SACD hosted a petition in favor of Roman Polanski, following his arrest for failure to appear in a California court for sentencing after pleading guilty to one count of statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl.

The SACD gives a prize to one of the feature films competing at the Critics&#x27; Week sidebar of the Cannes Film Festival.

<text>In geometry, a torus (: tori or toruses) is a surface of revolution generated by revolving a circle in three-dimensional space one full revolution about an axis that is coplanar with the circle. The main types of toruses include ring toruses, horn toruses, and spindle toruses. A ring torus is sometimes colloquially referred to as a donut or doughnut.

If the axis of revolution does not touch the circle, the surface has a ring shape and is called a torus of revolution, also known as a ring torus. If the axis of revolution is tangent to the circle, the surface is a horn torus. If the axis of revolution passes twice through the circle, the surface is a [[Lemon (geometry)|spindle torus]] (or &quot;self-crossing torus&quot; or &quot;self-intersecting torus&quot;). If the axis of revolution passes through the center of the circle, the surface is a degenerate torus, a double-covered sphere. If the revolved curve is not a circle, the surface is called a &quot;toroid&quot;, as in a square toroid.

Real-world objects that approximate a torus of revolution include swim rings, inner tubes and ringette rings. 

A torus should not be confused with a &quot;solid torus&quot;, which is formed by rotating a disk, rather than a circle, around an axis. A solid torus is a torus plus the volume inside the torus. Real-world objects that approximate a &quot;solid torus&quot; include O-rings, non-inflatable lifebuoys, ring doughnuts, and bagels.

In topology, a ring torus is homeomorphic to the Cartesian product of two circles: , and the latter is taken to be the definition in that context. It is a compact 2-manifold of genus 1. The ring torus is one way to embed this space into Euclidean space, but another way to do this is the Cartesian product of the embedding of in the plane with itself. This produces a geometric object called the Clifford torus, a surface in 4-space.

In the field of topology, a torus is any topological space that is homeomorphic to a torus. The surface of a coffee cup and a doughnut are both topological tori with genus one.

An example of a torus can be constructed by taking a rectangular strip of flexible material such as rubber, and joining the top edge to the bottom edge, and the left edge to the right edge, without any half-twists (compare Klein bottle).

== Etymology ==
&quot;&quot; is a Latin word for &quot;a round, swelling, elevation, protuberance&quot;.

== Geometry ==


A torus of revolution in 3-space can be parametrized as:
formula_1
using angular coordinates , , representing rotation around the tube and rotation around the torus&#x27;s axis of revolution, respectively, where the &quot;major radius&quot; is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus and the &quot;minor radius&quot; is the radius of the tube.

The ratio is called the &quot;aspect ratio&quot; of the torus. The typical doughnut confectionery has an aspect ratio of about 3 to 2.

An implicit equation in Cartesian coordinates for a torus radially symmetric about the z-axis is
formula_2

Algebraically eliminating the square root gives a quartic equation,
formula_3

The three classes of standard tori correspond to the three possible aspect ratios between and :
* When , the surface will be the familiar ring torus or anchor ring.
* corresponds to the horn torus, which in effect is a torus with no &quot;hole&quot;.
* describes the self-intersecting spindle torus; its inner shell is a &quot;lemon&quot; and its outer shell is an &quot;apple&quot;.
* When , the torus degenerates to the sphere radius .
* When , the torus degenerates to the circle radius .

When , the interior
formula_4
of this torus is diffeomorphic (and, hence, homeomorphic) to a product of a Euclidean open disk and a circle. The volume of this solid torus and the surface area of its torus are easily computed using Pappus&#x27;s centroid theorem, giving:
formula_5

These formulas are the same as for a cylinder of length and radius , obtained from cutting the tube along the plane of a small circle, and unrolling it by straightening out (rectifying) the line running around the center of the tube. The losses in surface area and volume on the inner side of the tube exactly cancel out the gains on the outer side.

Expressing the surface area and the volume by the distance of an outermost point on the surface of the torus to the center, and the distance of an innermost point to the center (so that and ), yields
formula_6

As a torus is the product of two circles, a modified version of the spherical coordinate system is sometimes used.
In traditional spherical coordinates there are three measures, , the distance from the center of the coordinate system, and and , angles measured from the center point.

As a torus has, effectively, two center points, the centerpoints of the angles are moved; measures the same angle as it does in the spherical system, but is known as the &quot;toroidal&quot; direction. The center point of is moved to the center of , and is known as the &quot;poloidal&quot; direction. These terms were first used in a discussion of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, where &quot;poloidal&quot; was used to denote &quot;the direction toward the poles&quot;.

In modern use, toroidal and poloidal are more commonly used to discuss magnetic confinement fusion devices.

== Topology ==

Topologically, a torus is a closed surface defined as the product of two circles: . This can be viewed as lying in  and is a subset of the 3-sphere of radius . This topological torus is also often called the Clifford torus. In fact, is filled out by a family of nested tori in this manner (with two degenerate circles), a fact that is important in the study of as a fiber bundle over (the Hopf bundle).

The surface described above, given the relative topology from , is homeomorphic to a topological torus as long as it does not intersect its own axis. A particular homeomorphism is given by stereographically projecting the topological torus into from the north pole of .

The torus can also be described as a quotient of the Cartesian plane under the identifications
: formula_7
or, equivalently, as the quotient of the unit square by pasting the opposite edges together, described as a fundamental polygon .
The fundamental group of the torus is just the direct product of the fundamental group of the circle with itself:
: formula_8

Intuitively speaking, this means that a closed path that circles the torus&#x27;s &quot;hole&quot; (say, a circle that traces out a particular latitude) and then circles the torus&#x27;s &quot;body&quot; (say, a circle that traces out a particular longitude) can be deformed to a path that circles the body and then the hole. So, strictly &#x27;latitudinal&#x27; and strictly &#x27;longitudinal&#x27; paths commute. An equivalent statement may be imagined as two shoelaces passing through each other, then unwinding, then rewinding.

If a torus is punctured and turned inside out then another torus results, with lines of latitude and longitude interchanged. This is equivalent to building a torus from a cylinder, by joining the circular ends together, in two ways: around the outside like joining two ends of a garden hose, or through the inside like rolling a sock (with the toe cut off). Additionally, if the cylinder was made by gluing two opposite sides of a rectangle together, choosing the other two sides instead will cause the same reversal of orientation.

The first homology group of the torus is isomorphic to the fundamental group (this follows from Hurewicz theorem since the fundamental group is abelian).

== Two-sheeted cover ==
The 2-torus is a twofold branched cover of the 2-sphere, with four ramification points. Every conformal structure on the 2-torus can be represented as such a two-sheeted cover of the 2-sphere. The points on the torus corresponding to the ramification points are the Weierstrass points. In fact, the conformal type of the torus is determined by the cross-ratio of the four points.

== &quot;n&quot;-dimensional torus ==
The torus has a generalization to higher dimensions, the , often called the or for short. (This is the more typical meaning of the term &quot;-torus&quot;, the other referring to holes or of genus .) Just as the ordinary torus is topologically the product space of two circles, the -dimensional torus is &quot;topologically equivalent to&quot; the product of circles. That is:
: formula_9

The standard 1-torus is just the circle: . The torus discussed above is the standard 2-torus, . And similar to the 2-torus, the -torus, can be described as a quotient of under integral shifts in any coordinate. That is, the &quot;n&quot;-torus is modulo the action of the integer lattice (with the action being taken as vector addition). Equivalently, the -torus is obtained from the -dimensional hypercube by gluing the opposite faces together.

An -torus in this sense is an example of an &quot;n-&quot;dimensional compact manifold. It is also an example of a compact abelian Lie group. This follows from the fact that the unit circle is a compact abelian Lie group (when identified with the unit complex numbers with multiplication). Group multiplication on the torus is then defined by coordinate-wise multiplication.

Toroidal groups play an important part in the theory of compact Lie groups. This is due in part to the fact that in any compact Lie group one can always find a maximal torus; that is, a closed subgroup which is a torus of the largest possible dimension. Such maximal tori have a controlling role to play in theory of connected . Toroidal groups are examples of protori, which (like tori) are compact connected abelian groups, which are not required to be manifolds.

Automorphisms of are easily constructed from automorphisms of the lattice , which are classified by invertible integral matrices of size with an integral inverse; these are just the integral matrices with determinant . Making them act on in the usual way, one has the typical &quot;toral automorphism&quot; on the quotient.

The fundamental group of an &quot;n&quot;-torus is a free abelian group of rank . The th homology group of an -torus is a free abelian group of rank &quot;n&quot; choose . It follows that the Euler characteristic of the -torus is for all . The cohomology ring &quot;H&quot;•(formula_10, Z) can be identified with the exterior algebra over the -module whose generators are the duals of the nontrivial cycles.
=== Configuration space ===
As the -torus is the -fold product of the circle, the -torus is the configuration space of ordered, not necessarily distinct points on the circle. Symbolically, . The configuration space of &quot;unordered&quot;, not necessarily distinct points is accordingly the orbifold , which is the quotient of the torus by the symmetric group on letters (by permuting the coordinates).

For , the quotient is the Möbius strip, the edge corresponding to the orbifold points where the two coordinates coincide. For this quotient may be described as a solid torus with cross-section an equilateral triangle, with a twist; equivalently, as a triangular prism whose top and bottom faces are connected with a 1/3 twist (120°): the 3-dimensional interior corresponds to the points on the 3-torus where all 3 coordinates are distinct, the 2-dimensional face corresponds to points with 2 coordinates equal and the 3rd different, while the 1-dimensional edge corresponds to points with all 3 coordinates identical.

These orbifolds have found significant applications to music theory in the work of Dmitri Tymoczko and collaborators (Felipe Posada, Michael Kolinas, et al.), being used to model musical triads.

== Flat torus ==


A flat torus is a torus with the metric inherited from its representation as the quotient, , where is a discrete subgroup of isomorphic to . This gives the quotient the structure of a Riemannian manifold, as well as the structure of an abelian Lie group. Perhaps the simplest example of this is when : , which can also be described as the Cartesian plane under the identifications . This particular flat torus (and any uniformly scaled version of it) is known as the &quot;square&quot; flat torus.

This metric of the square flat torus can also be realised by specific embeddings of the familiar 2-torus into Euclidean 4-space or higher dimensions. Its surface has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. It is flat in the same sense that the surface of a cylinder is flat. In 3 dimensions, one can bend a flat sheet of paper into a cylinder without stretching the paper, but this cylinder cannot be bent into a torus without stretching the paper (unless some regularity and differentiability conditions are given up, see below).

A simple 4-dimensional Euclidean embedding of a rectangular flat torus (more general than the square one) is as follows:
: formula_11
where &quot;R&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are positive constants determining the aspect ratio. It is diffeomorphic to a regular torus but not isometric. It can not be analytically embedded (smooth of class ) into Euclidean 3-space. Mapping it into &quot;3&quot;-space requires one to stretch it, in which case it looks like a regular torus. For example, in the following map:
: formula_12

If and in the above flat torus parametrization form a unit vector then &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, and parameterize the unit 3-sphere as Hopf coordinates. In particular, for certain very specific choices of a square flat torus in the 3-sphere &quot;S&quot;3, where above, the torus will partition the 3-sphere into two congruent solid tori subsets with the aforesaid flat torus surface as their common boundary. One example is the torus defined by
: formula_13

Other tori in having this partitioning property include the square tori of the form , where is a rotation of 4-dimensional space , or in other words is a member of the Lie group .

It is known that there exists no (twice continuously differentiable) embedding of a flat torus into 3-space. (The idea of the proof is to take a large sphere containing such a flat torus in its interior, and shrink the radius of the sphere until it just touches the torus for the first time. Such a point of contact must be a tangency. But that would imply that part of the torus, since it has zero curvature everywhere, must lie strictly outside the sphere, which is a contradiction.) On the other hand, according to the Nash-Kuiper theorem, which was proven in the 1950s, an isometric &quot;C&quot;1 embedding exists. This is solely an existence proof and does not provide explicit equations for such an embedding.
In April 2012, an explicit &quot;C&quot;1 (continuously differentiable) isometric embedding of a flat torus into 3-dimensional Euclidean space was found. It is a flat torus in the sense that, as a metric space, it is isometric to a flat square torus. It is similar in structure to a fractal as it is constructed by repeatedly corrugating an ordinary torus at smaller scales. Like fractals, it has no defined Gaussian curvature. However, unlike fractals, it does have defined surface normals, yielding a so-called &quot;smooth fractal&quot;. The key to obtaining the smoothness of this corrugated torus is to have the amplitudes of successive corrugations decreasing faster than their &quot;wavelengths&quot;. (These infinitely recursive corrugations are used only for embedding into three dimensions; they are not an intrinsic feature of the flat torus.) This is the first time that any such embedding was defined by explicit equations or depicted by computer graphics.

=== Conformal classification of flat tori ===

In the study of Riemann surfaces, one says that any two smooth compact geometric surfaces are &quot;conformally equivalent&quot; when there exists a smooth homeomorphism between them that is both angle-preserving and orientation-preserving. The Uniformization theorem guarantees that every Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one that has constant Gaussian curvature. In the case of a torus, the constant curvature must be zero. Then one defines the &quot;moduli space&quot; of the torus to contain one point for each conformal equivalence class, with the appropriate topology. It turns out that this moduli space &quot;M&quot; may be identified with a punctured sphere that is smooth except for two points that have less angle than 2π (radians) around them: One has total angle π and the other has total angle 2π/3. 

&quot;M&quot; may be turned into a compact space &quot;M*&quot; – topologically equivalent to a sphere – by adding one additional point that represents the limiting case as a rectangular torus approaches an aspect ratio of 0 in the limit. The result is that this compactified moduli space is a sphere with &quot;three&quot; points each having less than 2π total angle around them. (Such a point is termed a &quot;cusp&quot;, and may be thought of as the vertex of a cone, also called a &quot;conepoint&quot;.) This third conepoint will have zero total angle around it. Due to symmetry, &quot;M*&quot; may be constructed by glueing together two congruent geodesic triangles in the hyperbolic plane along their (identical) boundaries, where each triangle has angles of , , and . (The three angles of a hyperbolic triangle T determine T up to congruence.) As a result, the Gauss–Bonnet theorem shows that the area of each triangle can be calculated as , so it follows that the compactified moduli space &quot;M*&quot; has area equal to .

The other two cusps occur at the points corresponding in &quot;M*&quot; to (a) the square torus (total angle ) and (b) the hexagonal torus (total angle ). These are the only conformal equivalence classes of flat tori that have any conformal automorphisms other than those generated by translations and negation.

== Genus &quot;g&quot; surface ==

In the theory of surfaces there is a more general family of objects, the &quot;genus&quot; surfaces. A genus surface is the connected sum of two-tori. (And so the torus itself is the surface of genus 1.) To form a connected sum of two surfaces, remove from each the interior of a disk and &quot;glue&quot; the surfaces together along the boundary circles. (That is, merge the two boundary circles so they become just one circle.) To form the connected sum of more than two surfaces, successively take the connected sum of two of them at a time until they are all connected. In this sense, a genus surface resembles the surface of doughnuts stuck together side by side, or a 2-sphere with handles attached.

As examples, a genus zero surface (without boundary) is the two-sphere while a genus one surface (without boundary) is the ordinary torus. The surfaces of higher genus are sometimes called -holed tori (or, rarely, -fold tori). The terms double torus and triple torus are also occasionally used.

The classification theorem for surfaces states that every compact connected surface is topologically equivalent to either the sphere or the connect sum of some number of tori, disks, and real projective planes.

== Toroidal polyhedra ==
Polyhedra with the topological type of a torus are called toroidal polyhedra, and have Euler characteristic . For any number of holes, the formula generalizes to , where is the number of holes.

The term &quot;toroidal polyhedron&quot; is also used for higher-genus polyhedra and for immersions of toroidal polyhedra.

== Automorphisms ==
The homeomorphism group (or the subgroup of diffeomorphisms) of the torus is studied in geometric topology. Its mapping class group (the connected components of the homeomorphism group) is surjective onto the group formula_14 of invertible integer matrices, which can be realized as linear maps on the universal covering space formula_15 that preserve the standard lattice formula_16 (this corresponds to integer coefficients) and thus descend to the quotient.

At the level of homotopy and homology, the mapping class group can be identified as the action on the first homology (or equivalently, first cohomology, or on the fundamental group, as these are all naturally isomorphic; also the first cohomology group generates the cohomology algebra:
: formula_17

Since the torus is an Eilenberg–MacLane space , its homotopy equivalences, up to homotopy, can be identified with automorphisms of the fundamental group); all homotopy equivalences of the torus can be realized by homeomorphisms – every homotopy equivalence is homotopic to a homeomorphism.

Thus the short exact sequence of the mapping class group splits (an identification of the torus as the quotient of formula_15 gives a splitting, via the linear maps, as above):
: formula_19

The mapping class group of higher genus surfaces is much more complicated, and an area of active research.

== Coloring a torus==

The torus&#x27;s Heawood number is seven, meaning every graph that can be embedded on the torus has a chromatic number of at most seven. (Since the complete graph formula_20 can be embedded on the torus, and formula_21, the upper bound is tight.) Equivalently, in a torus divided into regions, it is always possible to color the regions using no more than seven colors so that no neighboring regions are the same color. (Contrast with the four color theorem for the plane.)
== de Bruijn torus ==
In combinatorial mathematics, a &quot;de Bruijn torus&quot; is an array of symbols from an alphabet (often just 0 and 1) that contains every -by- matrix exactly once. It is a torus because the edges are considered wraparound for the purpose of finding matrices. Its name comes from the De Bruijn sequence, which can be considered a special case where is 1 (one dimension).

== Cutting a torus ==
A solid torus of revolution can be cut by &quot;n&quot; (&gt; 0) planes into at most
: formula_22
parts. (This assumes the pieces may not be rearranged but must remain in place for all cuts.)

The first 11 numbers of parts, for (including the case of , not covered by the above formulas), are as follows:
: 1, 2, 6, 13, 24, 40, 62, 91, 128, 174, 230, ... .

<doc id="74803" wikidata="Q192783" url="?curid=74803" title="Doughnut">
<text>A doughnut (sometimes spelt donut in American English; both ) is a type of pastry made from leavened fried dough. It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors. &quot;Doughnut&quot; is the traditional spelling, while &quot;donut&quot; is the simplified version; the terms are used interchangeably.

Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, but other types of batters can also be used. Various toppings and flavors are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.

The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected with fruit preserves (the jelly doughnut), cream, custard, or other sweet fillings. Small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may be glazed with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate, or topped with powdered sugar, cinnamon, sprinkles or fruit. Other shapes include balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake (including the old-fashioned) and yeast-risen doughnuts. Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee or milk. They are sold at doughnut shops, supermarkets, convenience stores, petrol/gas stations, cafes or fast food restaurants.
==History==
===Forerunner===
A recipe for a deep-fried dough ball was recorded by Cato the Elder in his &quot;de agri cultura&quot;, using cheese, honey, and poppy seeds, called &quot;globi&quot;. Similar types of fried dough recipes have either spread to, or originated, in other parts of Europe and the World.

The cookbook &quot;Küchenmeisterei&quot; (&quot;Mastery of the Kitchen&quot;), published in Nuremberg in 1485, offers a recipe for &quot;Gefüllte Krapfen&quot;, stuffed, fried dough cakes.

The Spanish and Portuguese churro is a choux pastry dough that would also be served in a ring-shape. The recipe may have been brought from, or introduced to China, in the 16th century.


===England and North America===
Dutch settlers brought &quot;olykoek&quot; (&quot;oil(y) cake&quot;) to New York (or New Amsterdam) in the early 18th century. These doughnuts closely resembled later ones but did not yet have their current ring shape.

A recipe for fried dough &quot;nuts&quot; was published, in 1750 England, under the title &quot;How to make Hertfordshire Cakes, Nuts and Pincushions”, in &quot;The Country Housewife’s Family Companion by William Ellis.&quot;

A recipe labelled &quot;dow nuts&quot;, again from Hertfordshire, was found in a book of recipes and domestic tips written around 1800, by the wife of Baron Thomas Dimsdale, the recipe being given to the dowager Baroness by an acquaintance who transcribed for her the cooking instructions for a &quot;dow nut&quot;.

The first cookbook using the near conventional &quot;dough nuts&quot; spelling was possibly the 1803 edition of &quot;The Frugal Housewife: Or, Complete Woman Cook&quot;, which included dough nuts in an appendix of American recipes.

One of the earliest mentions of &quot;dough-nut&quot; was in Washington Irving&#x27;s 1809 book &quot;A History of New York, from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty&quot;:

The name &quot;oly koeks&quot; was almost certainly related to the &quot;oliekoek&quot;: a Dutch delicacy of &quot;sweetened cake fried in fat.&quot;

==Etymology==
===&quot;Dough nut&quot;===
One of the earliest known literary usages of the term dates to an 1808 short story describing a spread of &quot;fire-cakes and dough-nuts&quot;. Washington Irving described &quot;dough-nuts&quot;, in his 1809 &quot;History of New York, as&quot; &quot;balls of sweetened dough, fried in hog&#x27;s fat, and called dough-nuts, or&quot; olykoeks&quot;.&quot; These &quot;nuts&quot; of fried dough might now be called doughnut holes. The word &quot;nut&quot; is here used in the earlier sense of &quot;small rounded cake or cookie&quot;, also seen in ginger nut. &quot;Doughnut&quot; is the traditional spelling and still dominates even in the United States though &quot;donut&quot; is often used. At present, &quot;doughnut&quot; and the shortened form &quot;donut&quot; are both pervasive in American English.

===&quot;Donut&quot;===
The first known printed use of &quot;donut&quot; was in &quot;Peck&#x27;s Bad Boy and his Pa&quot; by George W. Peck, published in 1900, in which a character is quoted as saying, &quot;Pa said he guessed he hadn&#x27;t got much appetite, and he would just drink a cup of coffee and eat a donut.&quot; According to author John T. Edge the alternative spelling &quot;donut&quot; was invented in the 1920s when the New York–based Display Doughnut Machine Corporation abbreviated the word to make it more pronounceable by the foreigners they hoped would buy their automated doughnut making equipment. The donut spelling also showed up in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article dated August 10, 1929 in which Bailey Millard jokingly complains about the decline of spelling, and that he &quot;can&#x27;t swallow the &#x27;wel-dun donut&#x27; nor the ever so &#x27;gud bred&#x27;&quot;.

The interchangeability of the two spellings can be found in a series of &quot;National Donut Week&quot; articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that covered the 1939 World&#x27;s Fair. In four articles beginning 9 October, two mention the &quot;donut&quot; spelling. Dunkin&#x27; Donuts, which was so-named in 1950, following its 1948 founding under the name Open Kettle (Quincy, Massachusetts), is the oldest surviving company to use the &quot;donut&quot; variation; other chains, such as the defunct Mayflower Doughnut Corporation (1931), did not use that spelling. According to the Oxford Dictionaries while &quot;doughnut&quot; is used internationally, the spelling &quot;donut&quot; is American. The spelling &quot;donut&quot; remained rare until the 1950s, and has since grown significantly in popularity.

==Types==
===Rings===
Hanson Gregory, an American, claimed to have invented the ring-shaped doughnut in 1847 aboard a lime-trading ship when he was 16 years old. Gregory was dissatisfied with the greasiness of doughnuts twisted into various shapes and with the raw center of regular doughnuts. He claimed to have punched a hole in the center of dough with the ship&#x27;s tin pepper box, and to have later taught the technique to his mother. &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; states that his mother, Elizabeth Gregory, &quot;made a deep-fried dough that cleverly used her son&#x27;s spice cargo of nutmeg and cinnamon, along with lemon rind,&quot; and &quot;put hazelnuts or walnuts in the center, where the dough might not cook through&quot;, and called the food &#x27;doughnuts&#x27;.

Ring doughnuts are formed by one of two methods: by joining the ends of a long, skinny piece of dough into a ring, or by using a doughnut cutter, which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape, leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole (the dough removed from the center). This smaller piece of dough can be cooked and served as a &quot;doughnut hole&quot; or added back to the batch to make more doughnuts. A disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and pinched into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole. Alternatively, a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough (batter) directly into the fryer.

There are two types of ring doughnuts, those made from a yeast-based dough for raised doughnuts, or those made from a special type of cake batter. Yeast-raised doughnuts contain about 25% oil by weight, whereas cake doughnuts&#x27; oil content is around 20%, but have extra fat included in the batter before frying. Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at approximately , turning once. Yeast-raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry, about 150 seconds, at . Cake doughnuts typically weigh between , whereas yeast-raised doughnuts average and are generally larger, and taller (due to rising) when finished.

Daniela Galarza, for &quot;Eater&quot;, wrote that &quot;the now-standard doughnut’s hole is still up for debate. Food writer Michael Krondl surmises that the shape came from recipes that called for the dough to be shaped like a jumble – a once common ring-shaped cookie. In &quot;Cuisine and Culture: A History of Food and People&quot;, culinary historian Linda Civitello writes that the hole was invented because it allowed the doughnuts to cook faster. By 1870 doughnut cutters shaped in two concentric circles, one smaller than the other, began to appear in home-shopping catalogues&quot;.

====Topping====

After frying, ring doughnuts are often topped. Raised doughnuts are generally covered with a glaze (icing). Cake doughnuts can also be glazed, powdered with confectioner&#x27;s sugar, or covered with cinnamon and granulated sugar. They are also often topped with cake frosting (top only) and sometimes sprinkled with coconut, chopped peanuts, or sprinkles.

===Holes=== 
Doughnut holes are small, bite-sized doughnuts that were traditionally made from the dough taken from the center of ring doughnuts. Before long, doughnut sellers saw the opportunity to market &quot;holes&quot; as a novelty and many chains offer their own variety, some with their own brand names such as &quot;Munchkins&quot; from Dunkin&#x27; Donuts and &quot;Timbits&quot; from Tim Hortons.

Traditionally, doughnut holes are made by frying the dough removed from the center portion of the doughnut. Consequently, they are considerably smaller than a standard doughnut and tend to be spherical. Similar to standard doughnuts, doughnut holes may be topped with confections, such as glaze or powdered sugar.

Originally, most varieties of doughnut holes were derivatives of their ring doughnut (yeast-based dough or cake batter) counterparts. However, doughnut holes can also be made by dropping a small ball of dough into hot oil from a specially shaped nozzle or cutter. This production method has allowed doughnut sellers to produce bite-sized versions of non-ring doughnuts, such as filled doughnuts, fritters and Dutchies.

===Filled===
Filled doughnuts are flattened spheres injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, or other sweet fillings, and often dipped into powdered sugar or topped off with frosting. Common varieties include the Boston cream, coconut, key lime, and jelly.

===Other shapes===
Others include the fritter and the Dutchie, which are usually glazed. These have been available on Tim Hortons&#x27; doughnut menu since the chain&#x27;s inception in 1964, and a 1991 &quot;Toronto Star&quot; report found these two were the chain&#x27;s most popular type of fried dough in Canada.

There are many other specialized doughnut shapes such as old-fashioned, bars or Long Johns (a rectangular shape), or twists. Other shapes include balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. In the northeast United States, bars and twists are usually referred to as &quot;crullers&quot;. Another is the beignet, a square-shaped doughnut covered with powdered sugar, commonly associated with New Orleans.

== Science ==

=== Cake vs yeast style ===
Yeast doughnuts and cake doughnuts contain most of the same ingredients, however, their structural differences arise from the type of flour and leavening agent used. In cake doughnuts, cake flour is used, and the resulting doughnut has a different texture because cake flour has a relatively low protein content of about 7 to 8 percent. In yeast doughnuts, a flour with a higher protein content of about 9 to 12 percent is used, resulting in a doughnut that is lighter and more airy. In addition, yeast doughnuts utilize yeast as a leavening agent. Specifically, &quot;Yeast cells are thoroughly distributed throughout the dough and begin to feed on the sugar that is present ... carbon dioxide gas is generated, which raises the dough, making it light and porous.&quot; Whereas this process is biological, the leavening process in cake doughnuts is chemical. In cake doughnuts, the most common leavening agent is baking powder. Baking powder is essentially &quot;baking soda with acid added. This neutralizes the base and produces more CO2 according to the following equation: NaHCO3 + H+ → Na+ + H2O + CO2.&quot;

=== Physical structure ===
The physical structure of the doughnut is created by the combination of flour, leavening agent, sugar, eggs, salt, water, shortening, milk solids, and additional components. The most important ingredients for creating the dough network are the flour and eggs. The main protein in flour is gluten, which is overall responsible for creating elastic dough because this protein acts as &quot;coiled springs.&quot; The gluten network is composed of two separate molecules named glutenin and gliadin. Specifically, &quot;the backbone of the gluten network likely consists of the largest glutenin molecules, or subunits, aligned and tightly linked to one another. These tightly linked glutenin subunits associate more loosely, along with gliadin, into larger gluten aggregates.&quot; The gluten strands then tangle and interact with other strands and other molecules, resulting in networks that provide the elasticity of the dough. In mixing, the gluten is developed when the force of the mixer draws the gluten from the wheat endosperm, allowing the gluten matrix to trap the gas cells.

=== Molecular composition ===
Eggs function as emulsifiers, foaming agents, and tenderizers in the dough. The egg white proteins, mainly ovalbumin, &quot;function as structure formers. Egg solids, chiefly the egg white solids combined with the moisture in the egg, are considered structure-forming materials that help significantly to produce proper volume, grain, and texture.&quot; The egg yolk contributes proteins, fats, and emulsifiers to the dough. Emulsifying agents are essential to doughnut formation because they prevent the fat molecules from separating from the water molecules in the dough. The main emulsifier in egg yolk is called lecithin, which is a phospholipid. &quot;The fatty acids are attracted to fats and oils (lipids) in food, while the phosphate group is attracted to water. It is this ability to attract both lipids and water that allow phospholipids such as lecithin to act as emulsifiers.&quot; The proteins from both the egg yolk and the egg whites contribute to the structure of the dough through a process called coagulation. When heat is applied to the dough, the egg proteins will begin to unfold, or denature, and then form new bonds with one another, thus creating a gel-like network that can hold water and gas.

Shortening is responsible for providing tenderness and aerating the dough. In terms of its molecular structure, &quot;a typical shortening that appears solid [at room temperature] contains 15–20% solids and, hence, 80–85% liquid oil ... this small amount of solids can be made to hold all of the liquid in a matrix of very small, stable, needlelike crystals (beta-prime crystals).&quot; This crystalline structure is considered highly stable due to how tightly its molecules are packed. The sugar used in baking is essentially sucrose, and besides imparting sweetness in the doughnut, sugar also functions in the color and tenderness of the final product. Sucrose is a simple carbohydrate whose structure is made up of a glucose molecule bound to a fructose molecule. Milk is utilized in the making of doughnuts, but in large scale bakeries, one form of milk used is nonfat dry milk solids. These solids are obtained by removing most of the water from skim milk with heat, and this heat additionally denatures the whey proteins and increases the absorption properties of the remaining proteins. The ability of the casein and whey proteins to absorb excess water is essential to prolonging the doughnut&#x27;s freshness. The major whey protein in the nonfat milk solids is known as beta-lactoglobulin, and a crucial feature of its structure is that there exists a single sulfhydryl group that is protected by the alpha helix, and when heating of the milk solids occurs, these groups participate in disulfide exchanges with other molecules. This interchange prevents the renaturation of the whey proteins. If the crosslinking of the sulfide groups does not occur, the whey proteins can rebond and weaken the gluten network.

Water is a necessary ingredient in the production of doughnuts because it activates the other ingredients, allowing them to perform their functions in building the doughnut&#x27;s structure. For example, sugar and salt crystals must be dissolved in order for them to act in the dough, whereas larger molecules, such as the starches or proteins, must be hydrated in order for them to absorb moisture. Another important consideration of water is its degree of hardness, which measures the amount of impurities in the water source. Pure water consists of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, but water used in baking often is not pure. Baker&#x27;s salt (NaCl) is usually used as an ingredient due to its high purity, whereas the salts in water are derived from varying minerals. As an ingredient, &quot;salt is added to enhance the flavour of cakes and breads and to ‘toughen up’ the soft mixture of fat and sugar.&quot; If relatively soft water is being used, more salt should be added in order to strengthen the gluten network of the dough, but if not enough salt is added during the baking process, the flavor of the bread will not be appealing to consumers.

===Health effects===
Doughnuts are unhealthful, though some are less so than others. According to &quot;Prevention Magazine&quot;, doughnuts made from enriched flour provide some thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin, along with some fiber, but they are high in sugar and calories. Steps to improve the healthfulness of doughnuts include removing trans fats.

=== Dough rheology ===
An important property of the dough that affects the final product is the dough&#x27;s rheology. This property measures the ability of the dough to flow. It can be represented by the power law equation: formula_1 where formula_2 is the tangentic stress, formula_3 is the viscosity coefficient, formula_4 is the shear rate, and formula_5 is the flow index. Many factors affect dough rheology including the type and volume of ingredients and the force applied during mixing. Dough is usually described as a viscoelastic material, meaning that its rheology depends on both the viscosity and the elasticity. The viscosity coefficient and the flow index are unique to the type of dough being analyzed, while the tangential stress and the shear rate are measurements which depend on the type of force being applied to the dough.

==Regional variations==
===Asia===

====Cambodia====
&quot;Nom kong&quot; (នំបុ័ងកង់), the traditional Cambodian doughnut, is named after its shape – the word ‘កង់’ (pronounced &quot;kong&quot; in Khmer) literally means “wheel”, whilst &quot;nom&quot; (‘នំបុ័ង’) is the general word for pastry or any kind of starchy food. A very inexpensive treat for everyday Cambodians, this sweet pastry consists of a jasmine rice flour dough moulded into a classic ring shape and then deep fried in fat, then drizzled with a palm sugar toffee and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The rice flour gives it a chewy texture that Cambodians are fond of. This childhood snack is what inspired Cambodian-American entrepreneur Ted Ngoy to build his doughnut empire, inspiring the film The Donut King.

====China====
A few sweet, doughnut-style pastries are regional in nature. Cantonese cuisine features an oval-shaped pastry called &quot;ngàuhleisōu&quot; (牛脷酥, lit. &quot;ox-tongue pastry&quot;, due to its tongue-like shape).

A spherical food called &quot;saa1 jung&quot; (沙翁), which is also similar to a cream puff but denser with a doughnut-like texture and usually prepared with sugar sprinkled on top, is normally available in dim sum
Cantonese restaurants. An oilier Beijing variant of this called 高力豆沙, &quot;gaoli dousha&quot;, is filled with red bean paste; originally, it was made with egg white instead of dough. Many Chinese cultures make a chewy doughnut known as &quot;shuangbaotai&quot; (雙包胎), which consists of two conjoined balls of dough.

Chinese restaurants in the United States sometimes serve small fried pastries similar to doughnut holes with condensed milk as a sauce.

Chinese cuisine features long, deep-fried doughnut sticks that are often quite oily, hence their name in Mandarin, &quot;yóutiáo&quot; (油條, &quot;oil strips&quot;); in Cantonese, this doughnut-style pastry is called &quot;yàuhjagwái&quot; (油炸鬼, &quot;ghosts fried in oil&quot;). These pastries are lightly salted and are often served with congee, a traditional rice porridge or soy milk for breakfast.

====India====
In India, an old-fashioned sweet called gulgula is made of sweetened, deep-fried flour balls. A leavening agent may or may not be used.

There are a couple of unrelated doughnut-shaped food items. A savory, fried, ring-shaped snack called a &quot;vada&quot; is often referred to as the Indian doughnut. The &quot;vada&quot; is made from &quot;dal&quot;, lentil or potato flours rather than wheat flour. In North India, it is in the form of a bulging disc called &quot;dahi-vada&quot;, and is soaked in curd, sprinkled with spices and sliced vegetables, and topped with a sweet and sour chutney. In South India, a vada is eaten with &quot;sambar&quot; and a coconut chutney.

Sweet pastries similar to old-fashioned doughnuts called &quot;badushahi&quot; and &quot;jalebi&quot; are also popular. &quot;Balushahi&quot;, also called &quot;badushah&quot;, is made from flour, deep fried in clarified butter, and dipped in sugar syrup. Unlike a doughnut, &quot;balushahi&quot; is dense. A &quot;balushahi&quot; is ring-shaped, but the well in the center does not go all the way through to form a hole typical of a doughnut. &quot;Jalebi&quot;, which is typically pretzel-shaped, is made by deep frying batter in oil and soaking it in sugar syrup. A variant of &quot;jalebi&quot;, called &quot;imarti&quot;, is shaped with a small ring in the center around which a geometric pattern is arranged.

Along with these Indian variants, typical varieties of doughnuts are also available from U.S. chains such as Krispy Kreme and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts retail outlets, as well as local brands such as Mad Over Donuts and the Donut Baker.

====Indonesia====
The Indonesian, &quot;donat kentang&quot; is a potato doughnut, a ring-shaped fritter made from flour and mashed potatoes, coated in powder sugar or icing sugar.

====Japan====
In Japan, &quot;an-doughnut&quot; (あんドーナッツ, &quot;bean paste doughnut&quot;) is widely available at bakeries. &quot;An-doughnut&quot; is similar to Germany&#x27;s &quot;Berliner&quot;, except it contains red azuki bean paste. Mister Donut is one of the most popular doughnut chains in Japan. Native to Okinawa is a spheroid pastry similar to doughnuts called &quot;sata andagi&quot;. Mochi donuts are &quot;a cross between a traditional cake-like doughnut and chewy mochi dough similar to what’s wrapped around ice cream&quot;. This hybrid confection was originally popularized in Japan by Mister Donut before spreading to the United States via Hawaii. The Mister Donut style, also known as &quot;pon de ring&quot;, uses tapioca flour and produces mochi donuts that are easy to pull apart. Another variation developed in the United States uses glutinous rice flour which produces a denser mochi donut akin to Hawaiian-style butter mochi. Mochi donuts made from glutinous rice flour &quot;typically contain half the amount of calories as the standard cake or yeast doughnut&quot;.

====Malaysia====
&quot;Kuih keria&quot; is a hole doughnut made from boiled sweet potato that is mashed. The sweet potato mash is shaped into rings and fried. The hot doughnut is then rolled in granulated sugar. The result is a doughnut with a sugar-crusted skin.

====Nepal====
&quot;Sel roti&quot; is a Nepali homemade, ring-shaped, rice doughnut prepared during Tihar, the widely celebrated Hindu festival in Nepal. A semiliquid dough is usually prepared by adding milk, water, sugar, butter, cardamom, and mashed banana to rice flour, which is often left to ferment for up to 24 hours. A &quot;sel roti&quot; is traditionally fried in &quot;ghee&quot;.

====Pakistan====
Doughnuts are available at most bakeries across Pakistan. The Navaz Sharif variety, available mainly in the city of Karachi, is covered in chocolate and filled with cream, similar to a Boston cream. Doughnuts can readily be found at the many Dunkin&#x27; Donuts branches spread across Pakistan.

====Philippines====
Local varieties of doughnuts sold by peddlers and street vendors throughout the Philippines are usually made of plain well-kneaded dough, deep-fried in refined coconut oil and sprinkled with refined (not powdered or confectioner&#x27;s) sugar. Round versions of this doughnut are known as &quot;buñuelos&quot; (also spelled &quot;bunwelos&quot;, and sometimes confusingly known as &quot;bicho-bicho&quot;), similar to the doughnuts in Spain and former Spanish colonies. Indigenous versions of the doughnut also exist, like the &quot;cascaron&quot;, which is prepared similarly, but uses ground glutinous rice and coconut milk in place of wheat flour and milk.
Other native doughnut recipes include the &quot;shakoy&quot;, &quot;kumukunsi&quot;, and &quot;binangkal&quot;. &quot;Shakoy&quot; or &quot;siyakoy&quot; from the Visayas islands (also known as &quot;lubid-lubid&quot; in the northern Philippines) uses a length of dough twisted into a distinctive rope-like shape before being fried. The preparation is almost exactly the same as doughnuts, though there are variants made from glutinous rice flour. The texture can range from soft and fluffy, to sticky and chewy, to hard and crunchy (in the latter case, they are known as &quot;pilipit&quot;). They are sprinkled with white sugar, but can also be topped with sesame seeds or caramelized sugar. &quot;Kumukunsi&quot; is a &quot;jalebi&quot;-like native doughnut from the Maguindanao people. It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded into rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral. It has the taste and consistency of a creamy pancake. &quot;Binangkal&quot; are simple fried dough balls covered in sesame seeds. Other fried dough desserts include the mesh-like &quot;lokot-lokot&quot;, the fried rice cake &quot;panyalam&quot;, and the banana fritter &quot;maruya&quot;, among others.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, &quot;shuāngbāotāi&quot; (雙胞胎, lit. &quot;twins&quot;) is two pieces of dough wrapped together before frying.

====Thailand====
In Thailand, a popular breakfast food is &quot;pa thong ko&quot;, also known as Thai donuts, a version of the Chinese &quot;yiu ja guoy/youtiao&quot;. Often sold from food stalls in markets or by the side of the road, these doughnuts are small, sometimes X-shaped, and sold by the bag full. They are often eaten in the morning with hot Thai tea.

====Vietnam====
Vietnamese varieties of doughnuts include &quot;bánh tiêu&quot;,&quot; bánh cam&quot;, and &quot;bánh rán&quot;. &quot;Bánh tiêu&quot; is a sesame-topped, deep-fried pastry that is hallow. It can be eaten alone or cut in half and served with &quot;bánh bò&quot;, a gelatinous cake, placed inside the pastry. &quot;Bánh cam&quot; is from Southern Vietnam and is a ball-shaped, deep-fried pastry coated entirely in sesame seeds and containing a mung bean paste filling. &quot;Bánh rán&quot; is from Northern Vietnam and is similar to &quot;bánh cam&quot;; however, the difference is that &quot;bánh rán &quot;is covered with a sugar glaze after being deep-fried and its mung bean paste filling includes a jasmine essence.

===Europe===

====Austria====
In Austria, doughnut equivalents are called &quot;Krapfen&quot;. They are especially popular during Carnival season (Fasching), and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid and usually filled with apricot jam (traditional) or vanilla cream (&quot;Vanillekrapfen&quot;). A second variant, called &quot;Bauernkrapfen&quot; are also made of yeast dough, and have a thick outside ring, but are very thin in the middle.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, the &quot;smoutebollen&quot; in Dutch, or &quot;croustillons&quot; in French, are similar to the Dutch kind of &quot;oliebollen&quot;, but they usually do not contain any fruit, except for apple chunks sometimes. They are typical carnival and fair snacks and are coated with powdered sugar.

====Czech Republic====

U.S.-style doughnuts are available in the Czech Republic, but before they were solid shape and filled with jelly (strawberry or peach). The shape is similar to doughnuts in Germany or Poland. They are called &quot;Kobliha&quot; (&quot;Koblihy&quot; in plural). They may be filled with nougat or with vanilla custard. There are now many fillings; cut in half or non-filled knots with sugar and cinnamon on top.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, U.S.-style doughnuts may be found at various stores, e.g. McDonald&#x27;s and most gas stations. The Berliner, however, is also available in bakeries.

====Finland====

in Finland, a sweet doughnut is called a &quot;munkki&quot; (the word also means &quot;monk&quot;) and are commonly eaten in cafés and cafeteria restaurants. It is sold cold and sometimes filled with jam (like U.S. jelly donuts) or a vanilla sauce. A ring doughnut is also known as &quot;donitsi&quot;.

A savory form of doughnut is the &quot;lihapiirakka&quot; (literally &quot;meat pie&quot;). Made from a doughnut mixture and deep fried, the end product is more akin to a savory doughnut than any pie known in the English-speaking world.

====Former Yugoslavia====
Doughnuts similar to the Berliner are prepared in the northern Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia and Serbia (&quot;pokladnice&quot; or &quot;krofne&quot;). They are also called &quot;krofna&quot;, &quot;krafna&quot; or &quot;krafne&quot;, a name derived from the Austrian &quot;Krapfen&quot; for this pastry. In Croatia, they are especially popular during Carneval season and do not have the typical ring shape, but instead are solid. Traditionally, they are filled with jam (apricot or plum). However, they can be filled with vanilla or chocolate cream. Other types of doughnuts are &quot;uštipci&quot; and &quot;fritule&quot;. 

====France====
The French &quot;beignet&quot;, literally &quot;bump&quot;, is the French and New Orleans equivalent of a doughnut: a pastry made from deep-fried choux pastry.

====Germany====

In parts of Germany, the doughnut equivalents are called &quot;Berliner&quot; (sg. and pl.), but not in the capital city of Berlin itself and neighboring areas, where they are called &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; (which is often found misleading by people in the rest of Germany, who use the word &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; to describe a pancake, which is also the literal translation of it). Both &quot;Berliner&quot; and &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; are abbreviations of the term &quot;Berliner Pfannkuchen&quot;, however.

In middle Germany, doughnuts are called &quot;Kreppel&quot; or &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot;. In southern Germany, they are also called &quot;Krapfen&quot; and are especially popular during Carnival season (&quot;Karneval&quot;/&quot;Fasching&quot;) in southern and middle Germany and on New Year&#x27;s Eve in northern Germany. A &quot;Berliner&quot; does not have the typical ring shape of a doughnut, but instead is solid and usually filled with jam, while a ring-shaped variant called &quot;Kameruner&quot; is common in Berlin and eastern Germany. &quot;Bismarcks&quot; and &quot;Berlin doughnuts&quot; are also found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland and the United States. Today, U.S.-style doughnuts are also available in Germany, but are less popular than their native counterparts.

====Greece====
In Greece, a doughnut-like snack called &quot;loukoumas (λουκουμάς)&quot;, which is spherical and soaked in honey syrup, is available. It is often served with sprinkled cinnamon and grated walnuts or sesame seeds.

====Hungary====

Fánk is a sweet traditional Hungarian cake. The most commonly used ingredients are flour, yeast, butter, egg yolk, rum, salt, milk and oil for frying. The dough is allowed to rise for approximately 30 minutes, resulting in an extremely light pastry. &quot;Fánk&quot; is usually served with powdered sugar and lekvar.

It is supposed that &quot;Fánk&quot; pastry is of the same origin as German Berliner, Dutch &quot;oliebol&quot;, and Polish &quot;pączki&quot;.

====Italy====

Italian doughnuts include &quot;ciambelle&quot;, krapfen from Trentino-Alto Adige, &quot;zippuli&quot; or &quot;zeppole&quot; from Calabria and Campania, &quot;maritozzi&quot; from Latium, above all Rome, &quot;bomboloni&quot; from Tuscany, &quot;frittelle&quot; from Veneto and many others. In the island of Sardinia there is a particular donut, a ring cake called &quot;lorica&quot;.

====Lithuania====
In Lithuania, a kind of doughnut called &quot;spurgos&quot; is widely known. Some spurgos are similar to Polish pączki, but some specific recipes, such as cottage cheese doughnuts (&quot;varškės spurgos&quot;), were invented independently.

====Netherlands====

In the Netherlands, &quot;oliebollen&quot;, referred to in cookbooks as &quot;Dutch doughnuts&quot;, are a type of fritter, with or without raisins or currants, and usually sprinkled with powdered sugar. Variations of the recipe contain slices of apple or other fruits. They are traditionally eaten as part of New Year celebrations.

====Norway====
In Norway, smultring is the prevailing type of doughnut traditionally sold in bakeries, shops, and stalls. However, U.S.-style doughnuts are widely available in larger supermarkets, McDonald&#x27;s restaurants, 7-elevens and bakeries. The Berliner is more common than U.S.-style doughnut, and sold in most supermarkets and bakeries alongside &quot;smultring&quot; doughnuts.

====Poland====
In Poland and parts of the U.S. with a large Polish community, like Chicago and Detroit, the round, jam-filled doughnuts eaten especially—though not exclusively—during the Carnival are called pączki (). Pączki have been known in Poland at least since the Middle Ages. Jędrzej Kitowicz has described that during the reign of the Augustus III under influence of French cooks who came to Poland at that time, pączki dough fried in Poland has been improved, so that pączki became lighter, spongier, and more resilient.

====Portugal====
The malasada is a common type of holeless donut created in Portugal. They are made of fried dough. In Madeira and the Azores they are eaten on Fat Tuesday. It is also popular in Hawaii and Cape Cod. The malasada arrived after immigrants came in.

====Romania====
The Romanian dessert &quot;gogoși&quot; are fried dough balls similar to filled doughnuts. They are stuffed with chocolate, jam, cheese and other combinations and may be dusted with icing sugar.

====Russia====

In Russia and the other Post-Soviet countries, &quot;ponchiki&quot; (, plural form of пончик, &quot;ponchik&quot;) or (, especially in St. Petersburg) are a very popular sweet doughnut, with many fast and simple recipes available in Russian cookbooks for making them at home as a breakfast or coffee pastry.

====Slovenia====
In Slovenia, a jam-filled doughnut known as &quot;krofi&quot;, is very popular. It is the typical sweet during Carnival time, but is to be found in most bakeries during the whole year. The most famous &quot;krofi&quot; come from the village of Trojane in central Slovenia, and are originally filled with apricot jam filling.

====Spain====

In Spain, there are two different types of doughnuts. The first one, simply called &quot;donuts&quot;, or more traditionally &quot;berlinesas&quot;, is a U.S.-style doughnut, i.e., a deep-fried, sweet, soft, ring of flour dough.

The second type of doughnut is a traditional pastry called &quot;rosquilla&quot; or &quot;rosquete&quot; (the latter name is typical in the Canary Islands), made of fermented dough and fried or baked in an oven. &quot;Rosquillas&quot; were purportedly introduced in Spain by the Romans. In Spain, there are several variants of them depending on the region where they are prepared and the time of the year they are sold. In some regions they are considered a special pastry prepared only for Easter. Although overall they are more tightly textured and less sweet than U.S.-style doughnuts, they differ greatly in shape, size and taste from one region to another.

The &quot;churro&quot; is a sweet pastry of deep-fried dough similar to a doughnut but shaped as a long, thin, ribbed cylinder rather than a ring or sphere. &quot;Churros&quot; are commonly served dusted in sugar as a snack or with a cup of hot chocolate.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, there are &quot;Zigerkrapfen&quot;, &quot;Berliner&quot; and &quot;tortelli di San Giuseppe&quot;.

====Sweden====
Similar to the Finnish &quot;munkki&quot;, the Swedish &quot;munk&quot; is a sweet doughnut commonly eaten as &quot;fika&quot; along with coffee. It is sold cold and is sometimes filled with jam (U.S. jelly) or a vanilla sauce. A ring doughnut is also known as simply &quot;munk&quot;.

====Ukraine====

In Ukraine doughnuts are called &quot;pampushky&quot; (). &quot;Pampushky&quot; are made of yeast dough containing wheat, rye or buckwheat flour. Traditionally they are baked, but may also be fried. According to William Pokhlyobkin, the technology of making &quot;pampushky&quot; points to German cuisine, and these buns were possibly created by German colonists in Ukraine.

====United Kingdom====

In the United Kingdom, both filled and ring doughnuts are popular, with jam doughnuts and other varieties readily available at supermarkets. In some parts of Scotland, ring doughnuts are referred to as &quot;doughrings&quot;, with the &#x27;doughnut&#x27; name being reserved exclusively for the nut-shaped variety. Glazed, twisted rope-shaped doughnuts are known as &quot;yum-yums&quot;. It is also possible to buy fudge doughnuts in certain regions of Scotland. Fillings include jam, custard, cream, sweet mincemeat, chocolate and apple. Common ring toppings are sprinkle-iced and chocolate.

In Northern Ireland, ring doughnuts are known as &quot;gravy rings&quot;, &quot;gravy&quot; being an archaic term for hot cooking oil.

===North America===
====Caribbean region====
A &quot;kurma&quot; is a small, sweet, fried cube-shaped or rectangular doughnut which originated in Eastern India but is sold in Trinidad and Tobago.

====Costa Rica====
A traditional Puntarenas cream-filled doughnut is round and robust, managing to keep the cream inside liquified. They are popular in Costa Rica.

====Mexico====
The Mexican &quot;donas&quot; are similar to doughnuts, including the name; the dona is a fried-dough pastry-based snack, commonly covered with powdered brown sugar and cinnamon, white sugar or chocolate.

==== United States and Canada ====
Frosted, glazed, powdered, Boston cream, coconut, sour cream, cinnamon, chocolate, and jelly are some of the varieties eaten in the United States and Canada. There are also potato doughnuts (sometimes referred to as spudnuts).

Doughnuts are ubiquitous in the United States and can be found in most grocery stores, as well as in specialty doughnut shops. They are equally popular in Canada. Canadians eat more doughnuts per capita than any other nation and has more doughnuts shops per capita than any other nation.

A popular doughnut in Hawaii is the malassada. Malassadas were brought to the Hawaiian Islands by early Portuguese settlers, and are a variation on Portugal&#x27;s filhós. They are small, eggy balls of yeast dough deep-fried and coated in sugar.

Immigrants have brought various doughnut varieties to the United States. To celebrate Fat Tuesday in eastern Pennsylvania, churches sell a potato starch doughnut called a Fastnacht (or Fasnacht). The treats are so popular there that Fat Tuesday is often called Fastnacht Day. The Polish doughnut, the pączki, is popular in U.S. cities with large Polish communities such as Chicago, Milwaukee, and Detroit.

In regions of the country where apples are widely grown, especially the Northeast and Midwest states, cider doughnuts are a harvest season specialty, especially at orchards open to tourists, where they can be served fresh. Cider doughnuts are a cake doughnut with apple cider in the batter. The use of cider affects both the texture and flavor, resulting in a denser, moister product. They are often coated with either granulated, powdered sugar, or cinnamon sugar.

In southern Louisiana, a popular variety of the doughnut is the beignet, a fried, square doughnut served traditionally with powdered sugar. Perhaps the most well-known purveyor of beignets is New Orleans restaurant Cafe Du Monde.

In Quebec, homemade doughnuts called &quot;beignes de Noël&quot; are traditional Christmas desserts.

===Middle East and North Africa===
====Iran====
The Persian &quot;zoolbia&quot; and &quot;bamiyeh&quot; are fritters of various shapes and sizes coated in a sugar syrup. Doughnuts are also made in the home in Iran, referred to as doughnut, even in the plural.

====Israel====
Jelly doughnuts, known as &quot;sufganiyah&quot; (סופגניה, pl. sufganiyot סופגניות) in Israel, have become a traditional Hanukkah food in the recent era, as they are cooked in oil, associated with the holiday account of the miracle of the oil. Traditional &quot;sufganiyot&quot; are filled with red jelly and topped with icing sugar. However, many other varieties exist, with some being filled with &quot;dulce de leche&quot; (particularly common after the South American aliyah early in the 21st century).

====Morocco====
In Morocco, &quot;Sfenj&quot; is a similar pastry eaten sprinkled with sugar or soaked in honey.

====Tunisia====
In Tunisia, traditional pastries similar to doughnuts are &quot;yo-yos&quot;. They come in different versions both as balls and in shape of doughnuts. They are deep-fried and covered in a honey syrup or a kind of frosting. Sesame seeds are also used for flavor and decoration along with orange juice and vanilla.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, the doughnut is a popular snack food. Jam doughnuts are particularly popular, especially in Melbourne, Victoria and the Queen Victoria Market, where they are a tradition. Jam doughnuts are similar to a Berliner, but are served hot: red jam (raspberry or strawberry) is injected into the bun before it is deep-fried, and then it is coated with either sugar or sugar mixed with cinnamon as soon as it has been cooked. Jam doughnuts are sometimes also bought frozen. In South Australia, they are known as Berliner or Kitchener and often served in cafes. Popular variants include custard-filled doughnuts, and more recently Nutella-filled doughnuts.

Mobile vans that serve doughnuts, traditional or jam, are often seen at spectator events, markets, carnivals and fetes, and by the roadside near high-traffic areas like airports and the car parks of large shopping centres. Traditional cinnamon doughnuts are readily available in Australia from specialized retailers and convenience stores. Doughnuts are a popular choice for schools and other not-for-profit groups to cook and sell as a fundraiser.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, the doughnut is a popular food snack available in corner dairies. They are in the form of a long sweet bread roll with a deep cut down its long axis. In this cut is placed a long dollop of sweetened clotted cream and on top of this is a spot of strawberry jam. Doughnuts are of two varieties: fresh cream or mock cream. The rounded variety is widely available as well.

===South America===

====Brazil====
In Brazil, bakeries, grocery stores and pastry shops sell ball-shaped doughnuts popularly known as &quot;sonhos&quot; (lit. dreams). The dessert was brought to Brazil by Portuguese colonizers that had contact with Dutch and German traders. They are the equivalent of nowadays &quot;bolas de Berlim&quot; (lit. balls of Berlin) in Portugal, but the traditional Portuguese yellow cream was substituted by local dairy and fruit products. They are made of a special type of bread filled with &quot;goiabada&quot; (guava jelly) or milk cream, and covered by white sugar.

====Chile====
The &quot;Berlin&quot; (plural &quot;Berlines&quot;) doughnut is popular in Chile because of the large German community. It may be filled with jam or with &quot;manjar&quot;, the Chilean version of &quot;dulce de leche&quot;.

====Peru====
Peruvian cuisine includes picarones which are doughnut-shaped fritters made with a squash and sweet potato base. These snacks are almost always served with a drizzle of sweet molasses-based sauce.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===

====South Africa====
In South Africa, an Afrikaans variation known as the &quot;koeksister&quot; is popular. Another variation, similar in name, is the Cape Malay &quot;koesister&quot; being soaked in a spiced syrup and coated in coconut. It has a texture similar to more traditional doughnuts as opposed to the Afrikaans variety. A further variation is the &quot;vetkoek&quot;, which is also dough deep fried in oil. It is served with mince, syrup, honey or jam.

==In popular culture==

The doughnut has made an appearance in popular culture, particularly in the United States and Australia. References extend to objects or actions that are doughnut-shaped.
In film, the doughnut has inspired &quot;Dora&#x27;s Dunking Doughnuts&quot; (1933), &quot;The Doughnuts&quot; (1963) and &quot;Tour de Donut: Gluttons for Punishment&quot;. In video games, the doughnut has appeared in games like &quot;The Simpsons Game&quot; and &quot;Donut Dilemma&quot;. In the cartoon &quot;¡Mucha Lucha!&quot;, there are four things that make up the code of mask wrestling: honor, family, tradition, and doughnuts. Also, in the television sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Homer Simpson&#x27;s love affair with doughnuts is a prominent ongoing joke as well as the focal point of more than a few episodes. In the children&#x27;s book &quot;Homer Price&quot;, Homer&#x27;s Uncle Ulysses installs a doughnut making machine in his lunchroom in the fictional town of Centerburg. There is also a children&#x27;s book &quot;Arnie the Doughnut&quot; and music albums &quot;The Doughnut in Granny&#x27;s Greenhouse&quot;.

In films, TV shows, and other popular culture references, police officers are associated with doughnuts, depicted as enjoying them during their coffee break or office hours. This cliché has been parodied in the film &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot;, where Officer Zed is instructing new recruits how to &quot;properly&quot; consume their doughnuts with coffee. It is also parodied in the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, where the police station is always in large supply. In the video game &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, there is a &quot;Donut World&quot; shop, where only policemen are allowed. During a citywide &quot;lockdown&quot; after the Boston Marathon bombing, a handful of selected Dunkin&#x27; Donuts locations were ordered to remain open to serve police and first responders despite the closing of the vast majority of city businesses.

Cops &amp; Doughnuts, a doughnut shop in Clare, Michigan, is notable for being owned and operated by current and former members of the city&#x27;s police force.

Tim Hortons is the most popular Canadian doughnut and coffee franchise, and one of the most successful quick service restaurants in the country. In the Second City Television sketch comedy &quot;The Great White North&quot; featuring the fictional stereotypically Canadian brothers Bob and Doug MacKenzie (and in their film &quot;Strange Brew&quot;), doughnuts play a role in the duo&#x27;s comedy.

==Industry by country==
===Australia===
Donut King is Australia&#x27;s largest retailer of doughnuts. A Guinness Book of Records largest doughnut made up of 90,000 individual doughnuts was set in Sydney in 2007 as part of a celebration for the release of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;.

===Canada===
Per capita, Canadians consume the most doughnuts, and Canada has the most doughnut stores per capita.

=== United States ===
Within the United States, the Providence metropolitan area was cited as having the most doughnut shops per capita (25.3 doughnut shops per 100,000 people) as of 13 January 2010. National Doughnut Day celebrates the doughnut&#x27;s history and role in popular culture. There is a race in Staunton, Illinois, featuring doughnuts, called the Tour de Donut.

====Pink boxes====

In the US, especially in Southern California, fresh doughnuts sold by the dozen at local doughnut shops are typically packaged in generic pink boxes. This phenomenon has been attributed to Ted Ngoy and Ning Yen, refugees of the Cambodian genocide who began to transform the local doughnut shop industry in 1976. They proved so adept at the business and in training fellow Chinese Cambodian refugees to follow suit that these local doughnut shops soon dominated native franchises such as Winchell&#x27;s Donuts. Ngoy and Yen allegedly planned to purchase boxes of a lucky red color rather than the standard white, but settled on a leftover pink stock because of its lower cost.

In the mid-1970s, pink doughnut boxes were already a common sight in the eastern and midwestern United States, due to the fact that Dunkin&#x27; Donuts used a solid pink color for its boxes at that time. (It switched to a different box design sometime after 1975.) But the chain did not begin to establish a major presence in California until the 2010s.

Owing to the success of Ngoy and Yen&#x27;s business, the color soon became a recognizable standard in California. Due to the locality of Hollywood, the pink boxes frequently appeared as film and television props and were thus transmitted into popular culture.

==Holidays and festivals==
===National Doughnut Day===

National Doughnut Day, also known as National Donut Day, celebrated in the United States of America, is on the first Friday of June each year, succeeding the Doughnut Day event created by The Salvation Army in 1938 to honor those of their members who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I. About 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to France. Because of the difficulties of providing freshly baked goods from huts established in abandoned buildings near the front lines, the two Salvation Army volunteers (Ensign Margaret Sheldon and Adjutant Helen Purviance) came up with the idea of providing doughnuts. These are reported to have been an &quot;instant hit&quot;, and &quot;soon many soldiers were visiting The Salvation Army huts&quot;. Margaret Sheldon wrote of one busy day: &quot;Today I made 22 pies, 300 doughnuts, 700 cups of coffee.&quot;
Soon, the women who did this work became known by the servicemen as &quot;Doughnut Dollies&quot;.

<text>The Richmond Braves were an American minor league baseball club based in Richmond, Virginia, the Triple-A International League affiliate of the Atlanta Braves from 1966 to 2008. Owned by the parent Atlanta club and colloquially referred to as the R-Braves, they played their home games at a stadium called The Diamond on Richmond&#x27;s Northside built for them in 1985, and before then Parker Field on the same site. The franchise moved to Gwinnett County, Georgia, in 2009 to play in the newly built Coolray Field as the Gwinnett Braves.

The R-Braves came to Richmond in 1966 after the Braves&#x27; top affiliate, the Atlanta Crackers, moved to Virginia. The then-Milwaukee Braves had bought the Crackers as part of their planned move to Atlanta in 1965; under MLB rules of the day, they bought the Crackers in order to obtain the major league rights to Atlanta. However, an injunction forced the Braves to play a lame-duck season in Milwaukee in 1965, leaving them to operate the Crackers in Atlanta for one more season. When searching for a new home for the Crackers, they landed in Richmond, where Parker Field had been left open by the previous year&#x27;s move of the Richmond Virginians, a New York Yankees affiliate that moved in 1965. 

At the time of the R-Braves&#x27; departure to Gwinnett, only the Baltimore Orioles and their Appalachian League affiliate, the Bluefield Orioles, had held a longer affiliation agreement in a single city than Atlanta/Richmond&#x27;s 43 seasons. The Braves played their final game on September 1, 2008, against their long-time intrastate rivals, the Norfolk Tides. Richmond won, 9–3, in front of a sellout crowd of 12,167. After the game players and alumni threw balls and other keepsakes to fans in the stands, and fans were able to walk onto the field.

In 2010, the Double-A Eastern League&#x27;s Connecticut Defenders, a San Francisco Giants affiliate (but independently owned), moved to Richmond to play as the Richmond Flying Squirrels.

<doc id="74805" wikidata="Q142305" url="?curid=74805" title="Mother Goose">
<text>Mother Goose is a character that originated in children&#x27;s fiction, as the imaginary author of a collection of French fairy tales and later of English nursery rhymes. She also appeared in a song, the first stanza of which often functions now as a nursery rhyme. The character also appears in a pantomime tracing its roots to 1806.
The term&#x27;s appearance in English dates back to the early 18th century, when Charles Perrault&#x27;s fairy tale collection, &quot;Contes de ma Mère l&#x27;Oye&quot;, was first translated into English as &quot;Tales of My Mother Goose&quot;. Later a compilation of English nursery rhymes, titled &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle&quot;, helped perpetuate the name both in Britain and the United States.

==The character==
Mother Goose&#x27;s name was identified with English collections of stories and nursery rhymes popularised in the 17th century. English readers would already have been familiar with Mother Hubbard, a stock figure when Edmund Spenser published the satire &quot;Mother Hubberd&#x27;s Tale&quot; in 1590, as well as with similar fairy tales told by &quot;Mother Bunch&quot; (the pseudonym of Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy) in the 1690s. An early mention appears in an aside in a versified French chronicle of weekly events, Jean Loret&#x27;s &quot;La Muse Historique&quot;, collected in 1650. His remark, &quot;comme un conte de la Mère Oye&quot; (&quot;like a Mother Goose story&quot;) shows that the term was readily understood. Additional 17th-century Mother Goose/Mere l&#x27;Oye references appear in French literature in the 1620s and 1630s.

===Speculation about origins===
In the 20th century, Katherine Elwes-Thomas theorised that the image and name &quot;Mother Goose&quot; or &quot;Mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; might be based upon ancient legends of the wife of King Robert II of France, known as &quot;Berthe la fileuse&quot; (&quot;Bertha the Spinner&quot;) or &quot;Berthe pied d&#x27;oie&quot; (&quot;Goose-Footed Bertha&quot; ), often described as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children. Other scholars have pointed out that Charlemagne&#x27;s mother, Bertrada of Laon, came to be known as the goose-foot queen (&quot;regina pede aucae&quot;). There are even sources that trace Mother Goose&#x27;s origin back to the biblical Queen of Sheba. Stories of Bertha with a strange foot (goose, swan or otherwise) exist in many languages including Middle German, French, Latin and, Italian. Jacob Grimm theorised that these stories are related to the Upper German figure Perchta or Berchta (English Bertha). Like the legends of &quot;Bertha la fileuse&quot; in France and the story of Mother Goose Berchta was associated with children, geese, and spinning or weaving, although with much darker connotations. 

Despite evidence to the contrary, it has been stated in the United States that the original Mother Goose was the Bostonian wife of Isaac Goose, either named Elizabeth Foster Goose (1665–1758) or Mary Goose (d. 1690, age 42). She was reportedly the second wife of Isaac Goose (alternatively named Vergoose or Vertigoose), who brought to the marriage six children of her own to add to Isaac&#x27;s ten. After Isaac died, Elizabeth went to live with her eldest daughter, who had married Thomas Fleet, a publisher who lived on Pudding Lane (now Devonshire Street). According to Early, &quot;Mother Goose&quot; used to sing songs and ditties to her grandchildren all day, and other children swarmed to hear them. Finally, it was said, her son-in-law gathered her jingles together and printed them. No evidence of such printing has been found, and historians believe this story was concocted by Fleet&#x27;s great-grandson John Fleet Eliot in 1860. 

Iona and Peter Opie, leading authorities on nursery lore, give no credence to either the Elwes-Thomas or the Boston suppositions. It is generally accepted that the term does not refer to any particular person.

==Nursery tales and rhymes==
Charles Perrault, one of the initiators of the literary fairy tale genre, published a collection of such tales in 1695 called &quot;Histoires ou contes du temps passés, avec des moralités&quot; under the name of his son, which became better known under its subtitle of &quot;Contes de ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; or &quot;Tales of My Mother Goose&quot;. Perrault&#x27;s publication marks the first authenticated starting-point for Mother Goose stories. An English translation of Perrault&#x27;s collection, Robert Samber&#x27;s &quot;Histories or Tales of Past Times, Told by Mother Goose&quot;, appeared in 1729 and was reprinted in America in 1786.

Nursery rhymes were once believed to have been published in John Newbery&#x27;s compilation &quot;, or, Sonnets for the cradle&quot; published some time in London in the 1760s, but the first edition was probably published in 1780 or 1781 by Thomas Carnan, Newbery&#x27;s stepson and successor. Although this edition was registered with the Stationers&#x27; Company in 1780, no copy has ever been confirmed, and the earliest surviving edition is dated 1784. The name &quot;Mother Goose&quot; has been associated in the English-speaking world with children&#x27;s poetry ever since.

==Pantomime== 

In addition to being the purported author of nursery rhymes, Mother Goose is herself the title character in one
recorded by the Opies, only the first verse of which figures in later editions of their book. Titled &quot;Old Mother Goose and the Golden Egg&quot;, this verse prefaced a 15-stanza poem that rambled through a variety of adventures involving not only the egg but also Mother Goose&#x27;s son Jack. There exists an illustrated chapbook omitting their opening stanza that dates from the 1820s and another version was recorded by J. O. Halliwell in his &quot;The Nursery Rhymes of England&quot; (1842). Other shorter versions were also recorded later.

All of them, however, were dependent on a very successful pantomime first performed in London in 1806, and it is only by reference to its script that the unexplained gaps in the poem&#x27;s narration are made clear. The pantomime, staged at Covent Garden during the Christmas season, was the work of Thomas John Dibdin and its title, &quot;Harlequin and Mother Goose, or The Golden Egg&quot;, signals how it combines the &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; tradition and other folk elements with fable – in this case &quot;The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs&quot;. The stage version became a vehicle for the clown Joseph Grimaldi, who played the part of Avaro, but there was also a shorter script for shadow pantomime which allowed special effects of a different kind.
Special effects were needed since the folk elements in the story made a witch-figure of Mother Goose. In reference to this, and especially the opening stanza, illustrations of Mother Goose began depicting her as an old lady with a strong chin who wears a tall pointed hat and flies astride a goose. Ryoji Tsurumi has commented on the folk aspects of this figure in his monograph on the play. In the first scene, the stage directions show her raising a storm and, for the first time onstage, flying a gander – and she later raises a ghost in a macabre churchyard scene. These elements contrast with others from the harlequinade tradition in which the old miser Avaro transforms into Pantaloon, while the young lovers Colin and Colinette become Harlequin and Columbine.

A new Mother Goose pantomime was written for the comedian Dan Leno by J. Hickory Wood and Arthur Collins for performances at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1902. This had a different story line in which the poor but happy Mother Goose is tempted with wealth by the Devil. This was the ancestor of all the pantomimes of that title that followed, adaptations of which continue to appear. Playwright John J. McNally adapted the libretto by Wood and Collins for the 1903 Broadway musical &quot;Mother Goose&quot; which starred comedian Joseph Cawthorn in the title role. It used music by composer Frederick Solomon and lyrics by George V. Hobart.

Because nursery rhymes are usually referred to as Mother Goose songs in the US, however, children&#x27;s entertainments in which a medley of nursery characters are introduced to sing their rhymes often introduced her name into American titles. Early 20th century examples of these include &quot;A dream of Mother Goose and other entertainments&quot; by J. C. Marchant and S. J. Mayhew (Boston, 1908); &quot;Miss Muffet Lost and Found : a Mother Goose play&quot; by Katharine C. Baker (Chicago, 1915); &quot;The Modern Mother Goose: a play in three acts&quot; by Helen Hamilton (Chicago, 1916); and the up-to-the-moment &quot;The Strike Mother Goose Settled&quot; by Evelyn Hoxie (Franklin Ohio and Denver Colorado, 1922).

==Sculpture==
In the United States there is a granite statue of a flying Mother Goose by Frederick Roth at the entrance to Rumsey Playfield in New York&#x27;s Central Park. Installed in 1938, it has several other nursery rhyme characters carved into its sides. On a smaller scale, there is Richard Henry Recchia&#x27;s contemporary bronze rotating statue in the Rockport, Massachusetts, public library. There Mother Goose is depicted telling the tales associated with her to two small children, with twelve reliefs illustrating such stories about its round base.

<doc id="74809" wikidata="Q927" url="?curid=74809" title="Harry Mulisch">
<text>Harry Kurt Victor Mulisch (; 29 July 192730 October 2010) was a Dutch writer. He wrote more than 80 novels, plays, essays, poems, and philosophical reflections. Mulisch&#x27;s works have been translated into 38 languages so far.

Along with Willem Frederik Hermans and Gerard Reve, Mulisch is considered one of the &quot;Great Three&quot; (&quot;De Grote Drie&quot;) of Dutch postwar literature. His novel &quot;The Assault&quot; (1982) was adapted into a film that won both a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. Mulisch&#x27;s work is also popular among the country&#x27;s public: a 2007 poll of NRC Handelsblad readers voted his novel &quot;The Discovery of Heaven&quot; (1992) the greatest Dutch book ever written. He was regularly mentioned as a possible future Nobel laureate. He won the 2007 International Nonino Prize in Italy.

==Life==

Harry Kurt Victor Mulisch was born on 29 July 1927 in Haarlem in the Netherlands. Mulisch&#x27;s father was from Austria-Hungary and emigrated to the Netherlands after the First World War. During the German occupation in World War II his father worked for a German bank which also dealt with confiscated Jewish assets. His mother, Alice Schwarz, was Jewish. Mulisch and his mother escaped transportation to a concentration camp thanks to Mulisch&#x27;s father&#x27;s collaboration with the Nazis, but his maternal grandmother was killed in a gas chamber. Mulisch was raised largely by his parents&#x27; housemaid, Frieda Falk. Mulisch said of himself, he did not just write about World War II, he was WWII.

Mulisch lived in Amsterdam from 1958 until his death in 2010.

Mulisch had two daughters, his daughters Frieda and Anna, with his wife Sjoerdje Woudenberg, and a son, Menzo, from his relationship with Kitty Saal.

===Death===
Mulisch died in 2010. His death occurred at his Amsterdam home and his family was with him at the time. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte described his death as &quot;a loss for Dutch literature and the Netherlands&quot;. Culture minister Halbe Zijlstra bemoaned the demise of the &quot;Big Three&quot; as Gerard Reve and Willem Frederik Hermans had already died. Marlise Simons of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said his &quot;gift for writing with clarity about moral and philosophical themes made him an enormously influential figure in the Netherlands and earned him recognition abroad&quot;. &quot;The L Magazine&quot;″s Mark Ashe quoted the American editions of his novels by referring to him as &quot;Holland&#x27;s Greatest Author&quot; and &quot;Holland&#x27;s most important postwar writer&quot;.

==Works==
Mulisch gained international recognition with the film &quot;The Assault&quot; (1986), based on his book &quot;of the same title&quot; (1982). It received an Oscar and a Golden Globe for best foreign movie and has been translated into more than twenty languages.

His novel &quot;The Discovery of Heaven&quot; (1992) is considered his masterpiece and was voted &quot;the best Dutch-language book ever&quot; by Dutch readers in a 2007 newspaper poll. &quot;It is the book that shaped our generation; it made us love, even obsess, with reading&quot;, said Peter-Paul Spanjaard, 32, a lawyer in Amsterdam at the time of Mulisch&#x27;s death. It was filmed in 2001 as &quot;The Discovery of Heaven&quot; by Jeroen Krabbé, starring Stephen Fry.

Among the many awards he received for individual works and his total body of work, the most important is the Prijs der Nederlandse Letteren (&quot;Prize of Dutch Literature&quot;, a lifetime achievement award) in 1995.

==Themes in his work==
A frequent theme in his work is the Second World War. His father had worked for the Germans during the war and went to prison for three years afterwards. As the war spanned most of Mulisch&#x27;s formative phase, it had a defining influence on his life and work. In 1963, he wrote a non-fiction work about the Eichmann case: &quot;Criminal Case 40/61&quot;. Major works set against the backdrop of the Second World War are &quot;De Aanslag&quot; (The Assault), &quot;Het stenen bruidsbed&quot;, and &quot;Siegfried&quot;.

Mulisch often incorporated ancient legends or myths in his writings, drawing on Greek mythology (e.g. in &quot;De Elementen&quot;), Jewish mysticism (in &quot;De ontdekking van de Hemel&quot; and &quot;De Procedure&quot;), well known urban legends and politics (Mulisch was politically left-wing, once signing a book &quot;dedicated in admiration&quot; to Fidel Castro). Mulisch&#x27;s works are widely read.

In 1984, he delivered the Huizinga Lecture in Leiden, the Netherlands, under the title &quot;Het Ene&quot; (&quot;The Unifying Principle&quot;).

<text>Along with the Simpson family, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; includes a large array of characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople, local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to creator Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy show &quot;Second City Television&quot;.

The main episode characters, the Simpson family, are listed first; all other characters are listed in alphabetical order. Only main, supporting, and recurring characters are listed. For other recurring characters, see List of recurring &quot;The Simpsons&quot; characters.

<doc id="74817" wikidata="Q702224" url="?curid=74817" title="Duchy of Carinthia">
<text>The Duchy of Carinthia (; ; ) was a duchy located in southern Austria and parts of northern Slovenia. It was separated from the Duchy of Bavaria in 976, and was the first newly created Imperial State after the original German stem duchies.

Carinthia remained a State of the Holy Roman Empire until its dissolution in 1806, though from 1335 it was ruled within the Austrian dominions of the Habsburg dynasty. A constituent part of the Habsburg monarchy and of the Austrian Empire, it remained a Cisleithanian crown land of Austria-Hungary until 1918. By the 1920 Carinthian plebiscite in October 1920, the main area of the duchy formed the Austrian state of Carinthia.

==History==
In the seventh century the area was part of the Slavic principality of Carantania, which fell under the suzerainty of Duke Odilo of Bavaria in about 743. The Bavarian stem duchy was incorporated into the Carolingian Empire when Charlemagne deposed Odilo&#x27;s son Duke Tassilo III in 788. In the 843 partition by the Treaty of Verdun, Carinthia became part of East Francia under King Louis the German. From 889 to 976 it was the Carinthian March of the renewed Bavarian duchy, though in 927 the local Count Berthold of the Luitpolding dynasty was vested with ducal rights by the German king Henry the Fowler. After Berthold became Duke of Bavaria in 938, both territories were ruled by him. Upon his death in 948 the Luitpoldings, though heirs of the royal Ottonian dynasty, were not able to retain their possessions, as King Otto I bought the loyalty of his younger brother Henry I with the Bavarian lands.

===Establishment===

Duke Henry&#x27;s son Henry II &quot;the Quarreller&quot; from 974 onwards, revolted against his cousin Emperor Otto II, whereupon he was deposed as Duke of Bavaria in favour of Otto&#x27;s nephew Duke Otto I of Swabia. At the same time Emperor Otto II created a sixth duchy in addition to the original stem duchies, the new Duchy of Carinthia. He reverted the possession of the territories to the Luitpoldings, when he split Carinthia from the Bavarian lands and installed the former Duke Berthold&#x27;s son Henry the Younger as duke in 976.

Over the centuries, the name &#x27;Carinthia&#x27; (&quot;Kärnten&quot;) gradually replaced former &#x27;Carantania&#x27;. The realm of the Carinthian dukes initially comprised a vast territory including the marches of Styria (&quot;marchia Carantana&quot;), Carniola and Istria; they also ruled over the Italian March of Verona in the south. Nevertheless, Henry the Younger was the first and also the last Luitpolding duke; as he chose to join the unsuccessful War of the Three Henries against Emperor Otto II, he lost Carinthia two years later and was succeeded by the Emperor&#x27;s nephew Otto I, a scion of the Salian dynasty. Though Henry once again managed to regain the ducal title in 985, Carinthia upon his death in 989 fell back to the Imperial Ottonian dynasty in Bavaria.

===Eppensteins and Sponheims===

Carinthia, however, remained a separate entity, and in 1012 Count Adalbero I of Eppenstein, Margrave of the Carinthian March (later Styria) since about 1000, was vested with the duchy by the last Ottonian emperor Henry II, while the Istrian march was separated and given to Count Poppo of Weimar. Adalbero was removed from office in 1035 after he had fallen out of favour with the Salian Emperor Conrad II. In 1039 Carinthia was inherited by Emperor Henry III himself, who split off the Carniolan march the following year and granted it to Margrave Poppo of Istria. In 1077, the duchy was given to Luitpold, again a member of the Eppensteiner family, which, however, became extinct with the death of Luitpold&#x27;s younger brother Henry III of Carinthia in 1122. Upon his death the duchy was further reduced in area: a large part of the Eppenstein lands in what is today Upper Styria passed to Margrave Ottokar II of Styria.

The remainder of Carinthia passed from Duke Henry III to his godchild Henry from the House of Sponheim, who ruled as Henry IV, from 1122 to his early death the following year. The most outstanding of the Spanheim dukes was Bernhard, the first Carinthian duke who was actually described and honoured in documents as &quot;prince of the land&quot;. The last Spanheim duke was Ulrich III; he signed an inheritance treaty with his brother Archbishop Philip of Spanheim of Salzburg, who, however, could not prevail against the Bohemian king Ottokar II Přemysl. In spite of being supported by the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany, who defeated Ottokar II at the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278, Philip never gained actual power. The duchy was seized by Rudolph and Philip died a year later in 1279.

===Habsburgs===
Rudolf, after being elected King of the Romans and defeating King Ottokar II, at first gave Carinthia to Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol. In 1335, after the death of Henry, the last male of this line, Emperor Louis the Bavarian gave Carinthia and the southern part of the Tyrol as an imperial fief to the Habsburg family on 2 May in Linz. The Habsburgs would continue to rule Carinthia until 1918. As with the other component parts of the Habsburg monarchy, Carinthia remained a semi-autonomous state with its own constitutional structure for a long time. The Habsburgs divided up their territories within the family twice, according to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg and again in 1564. Each time, the Duchy of Carinthia became part of Inner Austria and was ruled jointly with the adjacent duchies of Styria and Carniola.
Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and her son Joseph II attempted to create a more unitary Habsburg state, and in 1804 Carinthia was integrated into the newly established Austrian Empire under Francis II/I. According to the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn, the Upper Carinthian territories around Villach formed part of the short-lived Napoleonic Illyrian Provinces; Carinthia as a whole remained a part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Illyria until its dissolution in 1849.

In 1867, the duchy became a crown land of Cisleithania, the western part of Austria-Hungary (see History of Austria).

Over the centuries, the German language, which carried more prestige, expanded at the expense of Slovene, but the fact that in the 16th century the Estates of Carinthia could still point out that Carinthia was &quot;a Windic Archduchy&quot;, i.e. a sovereign Slovene principality, shows that the Carinthian people were aware of their ancient and pre-German roots.

===World War I and Carinthian Plebiscite===

During World War I, Carinthia experienced a relatively high number of war deaths: thirty-seven for every 1,000 inhabitants. This was higher than in most other German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary (except German South Moravia).

Following the end of the war and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain stipulated the Carinthian Canal Valley stretching from Tarvisio as far as Pontafel (187 square miles) go to Italy and that the Slovene-speaking areas of the Meža Valley, the Drava Valley area around Unterdrauburg, which was afterwards renamed Dravograd, and the Jezersko area (128 square miles of territory) be ceded to the new SHS State. The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, however, was not satisfied with these parts of the former duchy and also occupied land north of the Karawanks mountain range, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. The Entente powers decided on a two-stage referendum, of which the first stage, the Carinthian Plebiscite was held on 10 October 1920 to determine the fate of Carinthia. The outcome in favour of Austria did not change the borders as decided upon in the Treaty of Saint-Germain.

The Austrian part of the former duchy today forms the federal state of Carinthia (), while the area that was ceded to Italy as a part of the claimed &quot;Julian March&quot; belongs to the autonomous region of Friuli–Venezia Giulia. Most of the area awarded to Yugoslavia (cf. Slovenian Carinthia) now forms part of the larger Carinthia Statistical Region in Slovenia.

<text>Carantania, also known as Carentania (, , in Old Slavic &quot;&quot;), was a Slavic principality that emerged in the second half of the 7th century, in the territory of present-day southern Austria and north-eastern Slovenia. 
It was the predecessor of the March of Carinthia, created within the Carolingian Empire in 889.

==Origin of the name==
The name &quot;Carantania&quot; is of proto-Slavic origin. Paul the Deacon mentions &quot;Slavs in Carnuntum, which is erroneously called Carantanum&quot; (&quot;Carnuntum, quod corrupte vocitant Carantanum&quot;).

A possible etymological explanation is that it may have been formed from a toponymic base &quot;carant-&quot; which ultimately derives from pre-Indo-European root *&quot;karra&quot; meaning &#x27;rock&#x27;, or that it is of Celtic origin and derived from *&quot;karant-&quot; meaning &#x27;friend, ally&#x27;. Its Slavic name &quot;&quot; was adopted from the Latin *&quot;carantanum&quot;. The toponym &quot;Carinthia&quot; (Slovene: &lt; Proto-Slavic &quot;*korǫt’ьsko&quot;) is also claimed to be etymologically related, deriving from pre-Slavic *&quot;carantia&quot;. In Slovene, &quot;Korotan&quot; remained a synonym for both Carinthia and Carantania well into the 19th and early 20th century. Nowadays, &quot;Karantanija&quot; is used for the early medieval Slavic principality, while &quot;Koroška&quot; for the duchy and region that emerged from it from the 10th century onward.

The name, like most toponyms beginning with *&quot;Kar(n)-&quot; in this area of Europe, are in turn most likely linked to the pre-Roman tribe of the Carni that once populated the eastern Alps.

==Territory==
Carantania&#x27;s capital was most likely Karnburg () in the Zollfeld Field (), north of modern-day town of Klagenfurt (). The principality was centered in the area of modern Carinthia, and included territories of modern Styria, most of today&#x27;s East Tyrol and of the Puster Valley, the Lungau and Ennspongau regions of Salzburg, and parts of southern Upper Austria and Lower Austria. It most probably also included the territory of the modern Slovenian province of Carinthia. The few existing historical sources distinguish between two separate Slavic principalities in the Eastern Alpine area: Carantania and Carniola. The latter, which appears in historical records dating from the late 8th century, was situated in the central part of modern Slovenia. It was (at least by name) the predecessor of the later Duchy of Carniola.

The borders of the later Carantania state, which was under the feudal overlordship of the Carolingians, and its successor (the March of Carinthia, 826–976), as well as of the later Duchy of Carinthia (from 976), extended beyond historical Carantania.

==History==

In the 4th century Chur became the seat of the first Christian bishopric north to the Alps. Despite a legend assigning its foundation to an alleged Briton king, St. Lucius, the first known bishop is one Asinio in AD 451.

In the aftermath of the Gothic War (535-554), the Byzantine Empire found itself unable to prevent the Germanic tribe of the Lombards from invading Italy and founding a kingdom there. The territory left behind by the Lombards in Pannonia was subsequently settled by Slavs (with the help of their Avar overlords) in the last decades of the 6th century. In 588 they reached the area of the Upper Sava River and in 591 they arrived in the Upper Drava region, where they soon fought the Bavarians under Duke Tassilo I. In 592 the Bavarians won, but three years later in 595 the Slavic-Avar army gained victory and thus consolidated the boundary between the Frankish and the Avar territories. By that time, today&#x27;s East Tyrol and Carinthia came to be referred to in historical sources as &quot;Provincia Sclaborum&quot; (the Country of Slavs).

In the 6th century Chur was also conquered by the Franks.

Between the 9th and 10th centuries, the Alpine Slavs, who are reckoned to be among the ancestors of present-day Slovenes, settled the eastern areas of the Friuli region. They settled in the easternmost mountainous areas of Friuli, known as the Friulian Slavia, as well as the Karst Plateau and the area north and south from Gorizia. 

Slavic settlement in the Eastern Alps region is assumed to be connected to the collapse of local dioceses in the late 6th century, a change in population and material culture, and most importantly, in the establishment of a Slavic language group in the area. The territory settled by Slavs, however, was also inhabited by the remains of the indigenous Romanized population, which preserved Christianity.

Slavs in both the Eastern Alps and the Pannonian region are assumed to be originally subject to Avar rulers (&quot;kagans&quot;). After Avar rule weakened around 610, a relatively independent March of the Slavs (&quot;marca Vinedorum&quot;), governed by a duke, emerged in southern Carinthia in the early 7th century. Historical sources mention Valuk as the duke of Slavs (&quot;Wallux dux Winedorum&quot;).

The year 626 brought an end to Avar dominance over Slavs, as the Avars were defeated at Constantinople. In 658 Samo died and his Tribal Union disintegrated. A smaller part of the original March of the Slavs, centred north of modern Klagenfurt, preserved independence and came to be known as &quot;Carantania&quot;. The name &quot;Carantania&quot; itself begins to appear in historical sources soon after 660. The first clear indication of a specific ethnic identity and political organisation may be recognised in the geographical term &quot;Carantanum&quot; which Paul the Deacon used in reference to the year 664, and in connection to which he also mentioned a specific Slavic people (&quot;gens Sclavorum&quot;) living there.

When about 740 Prince Boruth asked the Bavarian duke Odilo for help against the pressing danger posed by Avar tribes from the east, Carantania lost its independence. Boruth&#x27;s successors had to accept the overlordship of Bavaria and the semifeudal Frankish kingdom, ruled by Charlemagne from 771 to 814. Charlemagne also put an end to the invasions undertaken by the Avars, who had regained eastern parts of Carantania between 745 and 795.

In 828, Carantania finally became a margraviate of the Carolingian Empire. The local princes were deposed for following the anti-Frankish rebellion of Ljudevit Posavski, the prince of Slavs of Lower Pannonia, and replaced by a Germanic (primarily Bavarian) ascendancy. By the 843 Treaty of Verdun, it passed into the hands of Louis the German (804–876) who, according to the &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot; (863), gave the title of a &quot;prefect of the Carantanians&quot; (&quot;praelatus Carantanis&quot;) to his eldest son Carloman. In 887 Arnulf of Carinthia (850–899), a grandson of Louis the German, assumed his title of King of the East Franks and became the first Duke of Carinthia.

The city of Chur suffered several invasions by the Magyars in 925-926, when the cathedral was destroyed.
In the area of Carantania 954–979 exist Slavic parish &quot;pagus Crouuati&quot;(Croats) which is mentioned in royal charters, ruled by count Hartwig in the name of the German king.

==The Ducal Inauguration==

The principality of Carantania is particularly notable for the ancient ritual of installing Carantanian dukes (or princes, both an approximate translation of Knez/Knyaz/Fürst), a practice that continued after Carantania was incorporated into the later Duchy of Carinthia. It was last performed in 1414, when the Habsburg Ernest the Iron was enthroned as Duke of Carinthia. The ritual took place on the Prince&#x27;s Stone (Slovene &quot;Knežji kamen&quot;, German &quot;Fürstenstein&quot;), an ancient Roman column capital near &quot;Krnski grad&quot; (now Karnburg) and was performed in Slovene by a free peasant who, selected by his peers, in the name of the people of the land questioned the new Prince about his integrity and reminded him of his duties. Later, when the Duchy of Carinthia had fallen to the Habsburgs, the idea that it was actually the people from whom the Duke of Carinthia received his legitimation was the basis of the Habsburgs&#x27; claim to the unique title of Archduke.

The coronation of Carinthian Dukes consisted of three parts: first, a ritual in Slovene was performed at the Prince&#x27;s Stone; then a mass was held at the cathedral of Maria Saal (); and subsequently, a ceremony took place at the &quot;Duke&#x27;s Chair&quot; (, German: ), where the new Duke swore an oath in German and where he also received the homage of the estates. The Duke&#x27;s Chair is located at &quot;Zollfeld&quot; valley, north of Klagenfurt in modern Carinthia, Austria.

The ceremony was first described by the chronicler John of Viktring on the occasion of the coronation of Meinhard II of Tyrol in 1286. It is also mentioned in Jean Bodin&#x27;s book &quot;Six livres de la République&quot; in 1576.

==Mentions in late medieval literature==
Chronicle of Fredegar mentions Carantania as &quot;Sclauvinia&quot;, Dante Alighieri (1265–1321) mentions Carantania as &quot;Chiarentana&quot;. The same name was also used by Florentines, such as the poet Fazio degli Uberti (circa 1309–1367), the famous chronicler Giovanni Villani (c. 1275–1348), and Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375), who wrote that the Brenta River rises from the mountains of Carantania, a land in the Alps dividing Italy from Germany.

==Ethnic and social structure==

The population of ancient Carantania had a polyethnic structure. The core stratum was represented by two groups of Slavs who had settled in the Eastern Alps region in 6th century and are the ancestors of the present-day Slovenes and partially also Austrians. Other ethnic strong element included the descendants of the Romanised aboriginal peoples (Noricans), which is attestable on the basis of a recent DNA analysis and a number of place names. It is also possible that traces of Dulebes, Avars, Bulgars, Croats and the Germanic peoples were present among Carantanians.

==Language==
In its early stages, the language of Carantanian Slavs was essentially Proto-Slavic. In Slovenian linguistic literature and reference books it is sometimes provisionally termed &quot;Alpine Slavic&quot; (&quot;alpska slovanščina&quot;). Its Proto-Slavic character can be deduced from language contacts of Alpine Slavs with the remainders of the Romanised aboriginal population, later also with Bavarians. The adopted Pre-Slavic placenames and river names and their subsequent phonetic development in Alpine Slavic, as well as Bavarian records of Alpine Slavic names, shed light on the characteristics of the Alpine Slavic language.

From the 9th century onwards, Alpine Slavic underwent a series of gradual changes and innovations which were characteristic of South Slavic languages. By roughly the 13th century, these developments gave rise to the Slovene language.

<text>The pupil is a hole located in the center of the iris of the eye that allows light to strike the retina. It appears black because light rays entering the pupil are either absorbed by the tissues inside the eye directly, or absorbed after diffuse reflections within the eye that mostly miss exiting the narrow pupil. The size of the pupil is controlled by the iris, and varies depending on many factors, the most significant being the amount of light in the environment. The term &quot;pupil&quot; was coined by Gerard of Cremona.

In humans, the pupil is circular, but its shape varies between species; some cats, reptiles, and foxes have vertical slit pupils, goats and sheep have horizontally oriented pupils, and some catfish have annular types. In optical terms, the anatomical pupil is the eye&#x27;s aperture and the iris is the aperture stop. The image of the pupil as seen from outside the eye is the entrance pupil, which does not exactly correspond to the location and size of the physical pupil because it is magnified by the cornea. On the inner edge lies a prominent structure, the collarette, marking the junction of the embryonic pupillary membrane covering the embryonic pupil.

==Function==

The iris is a contractile structure, consisting mainly of smooth muscle, surrounding the pupil. Light enters the eye through the pupil, and the iris regulates the amount of light by controlling the size of the pupil. This is known as the pupillary light reflex.

The iris contains two groups of smooth muscles; a circular group called the sphincter pupillae, and a radial group called the dilator pupillae. When the sphincter pupillae contract, the iris decreases or constricts the size of the pupil. The dilator pupillae, innervated by sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion, cause the pupil to dilate when they contract. These muscles are sometimes referred to as intrinsic eye muscles.

The sensory pathway (rod or cone, bipolar, ganglion) is linked with its counterpart in the other eye by a partial crossover of each eye&#x27;s fibers. This causes the effect in one eye to carry over to the other.

===Effect of light===

The pupil gets wider in the dark and narrower in light. When narrow, the diameter be 1.5 to 4 millimeters. In the dark it will be the same at first, but will approach the maximum distance for a wide pupil 3 to 8 mm. However, in any human age group there is considerable variation in maximal pupil size. For example, at the peak age of 15, the dark-adapted pupil can vary from 4 mm to 9 mm with different individuals. After 25 years of age, the average pupil size decreases, though not at a steady rate. At this stage the pupils do not remain completely still, therefore may lead to oscillation, which may intensify and become known as hippus. The constriction of the pupil and near vision are closely tied. In bright light, the pupils constrict to prevent aberrations of light rays and thus attain their expected acuity; in the dark, this is not necessary, so it is chiefly concerned with admitting sufficient light into the eye.

When bright light is shone on the eye, light-sensitive cells in the retina, including rod and cone photoreceptors and melanopsin ganglion cells, will send signals to the oculomotor nerve, specifically the parasympathetic part coming from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which terminates on the circular iris sphincter muscle. When this muscle contracts, it reduces the size of the pupil. This is the pupillary light reflex, which is an important test of brainstem function. Furthermore, the pupil will dilate if a person sees an object of interest.

==Clinical significance==
===Effect of drugs===
If the drug pilocarpine is administered, the pupils will constrict and accommodation is increased due to the parasympathetic action on the circular muscle fibers, conversely, atropine will cause paralysis of accommodation (cycloplegia) and dilation of the pupil.

Certain drugs cause constriction of the pupils, such as opioids. Other drugs, such as atropine, LSD, MDMA, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, cocaine and amphetamines may cause pupil dilation.

The sphincter muscle has a parasympathetic innervation, and the dilator has a sympathetic innervation. In pupillary constriction induced by pilocarpine, not only is the sphincter nerve supply activated but that of the dilator is inhibited. The reverse is true, so control of pupil size is controlled by differences in contraction intensity of each muscle.

Another term for the constriction of the pupil is miosis. Substances that cause miosis are described as miotic. Dilation of the pupil is mydriasis. Dilation can be caused by mydriatic substances such as an eye drop solution containing tropicamide.

=== Diseases ===
A condition called &quot;bene dilitatism&quot; occurs when the optic nerves are partially damaged. This condition is typified by chronically widened pupils due to the decreased ability of the optic nerves to respond to light. In normal lighting, people affected by this condition normally have dilated pupils, and bright lighting can cause pain. At the other end of the spectrum, people with this condition have trouble seeing in darkness. It is necessary for these people to be especially careful when driving at night due to their inability to see objects in their full perspective. This condition is not otherwise dangerous.

=== Size ===

The size of the pupil (often measured as diameter) can vary between 8 and 1.5 mm. Pupil size can be a symptom of an underlying disease. Dilation of the pupil is known as mydriasis and contraction as miosis.
Not all variations in size are indicative of disease however. In addition to dilation and contraction caused by light and darkness, it has been shown that solving simple multiplication problems affects the size of the pupil. The simple act of recollection can dilate the size of the pupil, however when the brain is required to process at a rate above its maximum capacity, the pupils contract. There is also evidence that pupil size is related to the extent of positive or negative emotional arousal experienced by a person.

Myopic individuals have larger resting and dark dilated pupils than hyperopic and emmetropic individuals, likely due to requiring less accommodation (which results in pupil constriction).

Some humans are able to exert direct control over their iris muscles, giving them the ability to manipulate the size of their pupils (i.e. dilating and constricting them) on command, without any changes in lighting condition or eye accommodation state. However, this ability is likely very rare and its purpose or advantages over those without it are unclear.

==Animals==

Not all animals have circular pupils. Some have slits or ovals which may be oriented vertically, as in crocodiles, vipers, cats and foxes, or horizontally as in some rays, flying frogs, mongooses and artiodactyls such as elk, red deer, reindeer and hippopotamus, as well as the domestic horse. Goats, sheep, toads and octopus pupils tend to be horizontal and rectangular with rounded corners. Some skates and rays have crescent shaped pupils, gecko pupils range from circular, to a slit, to a series of pinholes, and the cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly curving W shape. Although human pupils are normally circular, abnormalities like colobomas can result in unusual pupil shapes, such as teardrop, keyhole or oval pupil shapes.

There may be differences in pupil shape even between closely related animals. In felids, there are differences between small- and large eyed species. The domestic cat &quot;(Felis sylvestris domesticus)&quot; has vertical slit pupils, its large relative the Siberian tiger &quot;(Panthera tigris altaica)&quot; has circular pupils and the Eurasian lynx &quot;(Lynx lynx)&quot; is intermediate between those of the domestic cat and the Siberian tiger. A similar difference between small and large species may be present in canines. The small red fox &quot;(Vulpes vulpes)&quot; has vertical slit pupils whereas their large relatives, the gray wolf &quot;(Canis lupus lupus)&quot; and domestic dogs &quot;(Canis lupus familiaris)&quot; have round pupils.

=== Evolution and adaptation ===
One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they can exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil. This would explain why slit pupils tend to be found in the eyes of animals with a crepuscular or nocturnal lifestyle that need to protect their eyes during daylight. Constriction of a circular pupil (by a ring-shaped muscle) is less complete than closure of a slit pupil, which uses two additional muscles that laterally compress the pupil. For example, the cat&#x27;s slit pupil can change the light intensity on the retina 135-fold compared to 10-fold in humans. However, this explanation does not account for circular pupils that can be closed to a very small size (e.g., 0.5 mm in the tarsier) and the rectangular pupils of many ungulates which do not close to a narrow slit in bright light. An alternative explanation is that a partially constricted circular pupil shades the peripheral zones of the lens which would lead to poorly focused images at relevant wavelengths. The vertical slit pupil allows for use of all wavelengths across the full diameter of the lens, even in bright light. It has also been suggested that in ambush predators such as some snakes, vertical slit pupils may aid in camouflage, breaking up the circular outline of the eye.

=== Activity pattern and behavior ===
In a study of Australian snakes, pupil shapes correlated both with diel activity times and with foraging behavior. Most snake species with vertical pupils were nocturnal and also ambush foragers, and most snakes with circular pupils were diurnal and active foragers. Overall, foraging behaviour predicted pupil shape accurately in more cases than did diel time of activity, because many active-foraging snakes with circular pupils were not diurnal. It has been suggested that there may be a similar link between foraging behaviour and pupil shape amongst the felidae and canidae discussed above.

A 2015 study confirmed the hypothesis that elongated pupils have increased dynamic range, and furthered the correlations with diel activity. However it noted that other hypotheses could not explain the orientation of the pupils. They showed that vertical pupils enable ambush predators to optimise their depth perception, and horizontal pupils to optimise the field of view and image quality of horizontal contours. They further explained why elongated pupils are correlated with the animal&#x27;s height.

==Society and culture==
The pupil plays a role in eye contact and nonverbal communication. The voluntary or involuntary enlargement or dilation of the pupils indicates cognitive arousal, interest in the subject of attention, and/or sexual arousal. On the other hand, when the pupil is voluntarily or involuntarily contracted, it could indicate the opposite - disinterest or disgust. Exceptionally large or dilated pupils are also perceived to be an attractive feature in body language.

In a surprising number of unrelated languages, the etymological meaning of the term for pupil is &quot;little person&quot;. This is true, for example, of the word &quot;pupil&quot; itself: this comes into English from Latin &quot;pūpilla&quot;, which means &quot;doll, girl&quot;, and is a diminutive form of &quot;pupa&quot;, &quot;girl&quot;. (The double meaning in Latin is preserved in English, where &quot;pupil&quot; means both &quot;schoolchild&quot; and &quot;dark central portion of the eye within the iris&quot;.) This may be because the reflection of one&#x27;s image in the pupil is a minuscule version of one&#x27;s self. In the Old Babylonian period (c. 1800-1600 BC) in ancient Mesopotamia, the expression &quot;protective spirit of the eye&quot; is attested, perhaps arising from the same phenomenon.

The English phrase &quot;apple of my eye&quot; arises from an Old English usage, in which the word &quot;apple&quot; meant not only the fruit but also the pupil or eyeball.

The film stars stage actor George Beban in the title role as the Italian immigrant, Pietro &quot;Beppo&quot; Donnetti. In 1991, this film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==

The film tells the story of Pietro &quot;Beppo&quot; Donnetti. Donnetti is a poor, but happy, gondolier in Venice, Italy. Beppo falls in love with Annette Ancello, but her father, Trudo, wants her to marry another suitor, one who is a successful businessman. If Beppo can prove himself within a year, Trudo agrees to allow him to marry Annette.

Beppo sails for America to make his fortune, making a living working as a shoeshiner on a street corner in New York City. He borrows money from an Irish ward boss, Bill Corrigan, and sends for Annette to join him. In exchange, Beppo agrees to help Corrigan&#x27;s candidate win the Italian vote in the ward.

When Annette arrives in New York, she and Beppo are married, and the following year they have a son, Tony. Beppo, Annette and Tony live a happy life in their Lower East Side tenement. The happiness is interrupted when the baby contracts a fever during a heatwave. The doctor instructs them to feed pasteurized milk to the baby. Beppo works hard to earn the money to purchase the expensive milk. While walking to the store to buy the milk, Beppo is robbed. He attacks the men who robbed him and is arrested. Beppo asks Corrigan to help his baby while he is in jail: &quot;I must get-a-de-milk or my babee is die.&quot; Corrigan rebuffs Beppo, and Beppo&#x27;s baby dies during Beppo&#x27;s five days in jail.

When Beppo is released from jail, he learns that Corrigan&#x27;s young daughter is ill and vows to avenge his son&#x27;s death by killing Corrigan&#x27;s daughter. Beppo sneaks into Corrigan&#x27;s house, but when he sees Corrigan&#x27;s daughter lying in her crib, he cannot act on his plan, and he leaves the child unharmed.

In the final scene of the narrative, Beppo is shown placing flowers and sobbing over his son&#x27;s grave.

==Prologue and epilogue==
The film employs a prologue and epilogue to frame the narrative story. In the prologue, a stage curtain rises and shows the lead actor, George Beban, in an upper class apartment wearing a smoking jacket. He sits on a couch and opens a book titled &quot;The Italian&quot; by Thomas H. Ince and C. Gardner Sullivan. As he begins reading, the film fades into the narrative story. In the epilogue, the film shifts from the image of Beppo kneeling at his son&#x27;s grave to Beban turning to the last page of the book, closing the book and looking thoughtful. The stage curtain is then drawn closed.

Some critics have suggested the prologue and epilogue were intended to demonstrate the care with which Beban, a noted stage actor, had selected a story worthy of his talents.

==Production==

Historical accounts indicate that Thomas Ince and C. Gardner Sullivan had originally titled their project &quot;Dago&quot;, but agreed to change the title at the request of the film&#x27;s star, George Beban. &quot;The Italian&quot; marked the first motion picture role for Beban, who had gained acclaim as a Broadway actor and vaudevillian specializing in ethnic caricatures. Beban only agreed to join the project for a salary of $7000 and a percentage of the films profits.

Ince and Sullivan are credited with writing the film&#x27;s story, but film historian Kevin Brownlow has shown that the plot was essentially lifted from the earlier Independent Moving Pictures (Ince&#x27;s former employer) film &quot;The Wop&quot; (1913).

Though set on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, the New York scenes for &quot;The Italian&quot; were shot in the immigrant quarter of San Francisco. While most accounts indicate that the scenes of Beppo as a gondolier were shot in the Venice district of Los Angeles, an account published by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in November 1914 reported that &quot;Ince sent Beban to Italy to get special canal scenes for the eight-reel play.&quot;

One of the vivid scenes in &quot;The Italian&quot; is the fight scene between Beppo and his muggers. The scene lasts five minutes on the screen, and a newspaper story reported that, for realism, &quot;a number of the biggest men at Inceville were used in the scene.&quot;

In a story on the production of &quot;The Italian&quot;, a newspaper reported that a hundred pounds of rice were bought for the film&#x27;s wedding scene. An initial order of fifty pounds of rice was left uncovered overnight by a &quot;property man&quot; at the Inceville studio. A &quot;heavy rain caused each grain to swell to enormous proportions,&quot; requiring the purchase of another fifty pounds of rice.

==Critical reception==

===Initial reviews===

Upon the release of &quot;The Italian&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a positive review which included the following comments:&quot;There are possibilities in the role of Pietro, in &#x27;The Italian&#x27; ... that a less clever character artist than George Beban might overlook ... The story is full of human interest, requiring a full understanding of the character, and Beban by look and gesture is at all times in fullest sympathy with the difficult role. ... [A]ll go to make a story that pulsates with human interest. The pathos of the child&#x27;s death because of the lack of necessities and the imprisonment of the poor Italian furnish the real lesson of the Ghetto.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a fascinating story,&quot; and &quot;a simple story of ghetto life, showing that love, faith, and loyalty are not unknown quantities in this dark sphere.&quot;

A newspaper in Fort Wayne, Indiana praised the film for its &quot;rare quality of charm and a warmth of appeal that is truly unique&quot; and concluded: &quot;Here is a story beautiful and exquisite in theme ... Its simplicity and utter humanness have an appeal that reaches straight to the heart of the onlooker.&quot; Another review in the same paper also commended the &quot;simple beauty of the story itself&quot; and also praised Beban&#x27;s performance:&quot;George Beban, who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece of character work that is truly marvelous. This artist has developed mimicry to its highest form of expression. His mobile countenance mirrored every emotion so perfectly, each varying mood was portrayed so truly, that it was hard to believe that this man was naught but a pantomimist. The upward glance when the heart was bitten again by the fangs of emotion, the hysterical joy of the Latin nature when in high spirits, all these phrases were delineated by this artist in a way that moved and thrilled.&quot;

A newspaper in San Antonio, Texas praised the &quot;vein of innocent humor&quot; that runs through the film at the expense of Beppo and concluded: &quot;&#x27;The Italian&#x27; is regarded as Thomas H. Ince&#x27;s masterpiece and is said to be greater than his &#x27;Wrath of the Gods,&#x27; &#x27;The Typhoon&#x27; and &#x27;The Bargain.&#x27;&quot;

===Modern assessments===
In 2008, &quot;The Italian&quot; was released on DVD as part of a two-disc compilation titled, &quot;Perils of the New Land: Films of the Immigrant Experience (1910-1915).&quot; At the time of the DVD release, &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film for Reginald Barker&#x27;s strong direction, including his use of a mobile camera and &quot;liberal use of close-up&quot; which give the film a subjective, personal feel. The &quot;Times&quot; also praised Beban&#x27;s &quot;powerful lead performance&quot; which it described as follows:&quot;The audience is drawn to identify with Beppo, even though he remains in many respects an appalling ethnic caricature: dark, brooding, vengeful. That Barker and Beban are able to create so much sympathy for Beppo, despite their own, occasionally quite obvious condescension to the character, is a mark of emerging maturity in the movie business; no longer are films dealing in one-dimensional &#x27;types.&#x27;&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2008 described &quot;The Italian&quot; as &quot;a shameless melodrama that, despite unfortunate stereotypes, musters considerable sympathy for its titular immigrant.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; also noted that &quot;Beban, the silent-era star known for his ethnic impersonations, hams up a storm as Beppo, a jaunty Venetian.&quot;

The film publication &quot;Cineaste&quot; published a review of &quot;The Italian&quot; in March 2009, focusing on the film&#x27;s depiction of the Italian-American immigrant experience as a Darwinian jungle rather than a promised land paved with gold:&quot;Against Horatio Alger expectations, &quot;The Italian&quot; is a story of failure suffused with a soft-focused, dappled nostalgia for the old country ... &#x27;From sunny Italy to the New York ghetto,&#x27; read the taglines on Paramount&#x27;s original one-sheet, contrasting scenes of &#x27;carefree Beppo at home&#x27; in the serene canals of Old Italy with the mean streets of New York where &#x27;to live your baby must have Pasteurized milk.&#x27; America is not a promised land paved with gold but a Darwinian jungle, where dreams meet dead ends.&quot;
Cineaste also credited Beban for his intense performance, commenting on the fight sequence in which Beban&#x27;s character &quot;seethes with murderous determination&quot; as the camera focuses on his face in an extreme close-up: &quot;Beban&#x27;s sudden transformation from amiability to wrath recalls the first glimpse of Spencer Tracy after nearly being lynched in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Fury&quot;.&quot;

A reviewer for the publication &quot;Bright Sights&quot; wrote that the film had a powerfully downbeat conclusion with a social message:&quot;Projecting overwhelming grief, Beban reveals some hefty acting chops, and &quot;The Italian&quot; certainly gets its liberal point across, a model of how American movies dress social consciousness in the garb of melodrama. Even here, in its infancy, feature film was eager to pick up the call for social reform that sounded out in urban America before the First World War.&quot;

In his 2004 historical book on the depiction of Italians in Hollywood movies, Peter Bondanella praised the film:&quot;A number of elements sets &quot;The Italian&quot; apart from the other films treating the Italian immigrant experience. ... Its melodramatic plot reflects a serious sense of artistic construction, aimed at milking the last bit of emotion out of the audience. George Beban&#x27;s outstanding performance shows his roots in the dramatic theater. ... Finally, the depiction of the tragic story of Beppo shows a certain sympathy for the character of the poor Italian bootblack but also includes a callous disregard for depicting Italian immigrants in a stereotypical manner, an attitude that no doubt reflected the opinions of the majority of Americans at the time. Its plot is simple and compelling.&quot;

Despite its occasional use of patronizing stereotypes, Bondanella concludes that Beppo &quot;is represented with great dignity and even comic twists, making Beppo a far more lovable figure than one might expect.&quot; He concludes his chapter on the film with the following comment: &quot;In short, what emerges from &quot;The Italian&quot; is an unusually complex view of tenement life and multiethnic immigration in America, and the film consequently retains its value not only as social history but also as a work of art.&quot;

In his book about the history of film editing, Don Fairservice credits &quot;The Italian&quot;&#x27;s director, Reginald Barker, for his early use of editing to maintain story continuity and for his use of multidirectional camera positioning and variable framing to emphasize character development and psychological motivation rather than plot.

A review in &quot;DVD Talk&quot; concluded that Beban&#x27;s performance was able to overcome the film&#x27;s melodramatic premise:&quot;Beppo is a delightful character ... His rage after being robbed was another standout moment. The camera does a very tight closeup, one of the closest I can recall for a film from 1915, and his anger and fear are almost palatable. ... The ending of the film is also very dramatic and works well, without a false Hollywood happy ending ... It was nice to see the hardships of poverty portrayed without any easy answers, something that doesn&#x27;t often happen.&quot;

<text>Anton Melik (January 1, 1890 – June 8, 1966) was a Slovene geographer.

==Biography==
Melik was born in the village of Črna Vas in Carniola, part of Austria-Hungary. Before and during World War I, he studied at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1916 in history and geography. Later he was employed as a secondary school teacher. In 1926–1927 he became an associate professor at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana, in 1932 a senior lecturer, and then in 1938 a professor.

In 1927 he received his PhD from the Faculty of Arts with his dissertation on the settlement of the Ljubljana Marsh. Between 1938 and 1966, he was a professor of geomorphology at the Department of Geography at the University of Ljubljana, succeeding professor Artur Gavazzi in 1938. With his work in this field he established his well-known geomorphological school.

In 1935–1936, the publishing house &quot;Slovenska matica&quot; published his monumental work &quot;Geografija Slovenije&quot; (The Geography of Slovenia) in two volumes with a general regional part, later extended with four additional books between 1954 and 1960, with a detailed regional description of particular areas of Slovenia: the Alps, Styria with Prekmurje and the Meža Valley, the Lower Sava Valley, and the Slovenian Littoral.

Between 1947 and 1960, Melik was head of the Department of Geography at the Faculty of Arts. Between 1948 and 1966, he was head of the Geographical Institute of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Between 1946/1947 and 1949/1950, he was chancellor of the University of Ljubljana, and he served twice as dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1940/1941 and 1945/1946. He retired in 1966. He died in Ljubljana.

In 1976, the Geographical Institute of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, founded in 1946, was renamed the Anton Melik Geographical Institute in his honor.

==Family==
His two brothers Franc Melik (born 1885), and Ivan Melik (born 1894) were killed in a grove known as Kosler&#x27;s Thicket (, named after its former owner Peter Kosler), on November 25, 1943 together with 12 other victims by a unit of the collaborationist Slovenian Home Guard militia under the command of Franc Frakelj.

For his work on the geography of Slovenia and Yugoslavia, Melik received the Prešeren Award in 1947, 1949, and 1951. His son, Vasilij Melik, was a historian; his two other sons, Anton (1918) and Andrej (1927–1930), died as children.

<text>Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the 1974 novel by Peter Benchley. It stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, who, with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a professional shark hunter (Robert Shaw), hunts a man-eating great white shark that attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town. Murray Hamilton plays the mayor, and Lorraine Gary portrays Brody&#x27;s wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.

Shot mostly on location at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard in Massachusetts from May to October 1974, &quot;Jaws&quot; was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean and consequently had a troubled production, going over budget and schedule. As the art department&#x27;s mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark&#x27;s presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer John Williams to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director Alfred Hitchcock. Universal Pictures&#x27; release of the film to over 450 screens was an exceptionally wide release for a major studio picture at the time, and it was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that heavily emphasized television spots and tie-in merchandise.

Regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, &quot;Jaws&quot; was the prototypical summer blockbuster and won several awards for its music and editing. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; two years later; both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple high-concept premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and advertised heavily. &quot;Jaws&quot; was followed by three sequels (none of which involved Spielberg or Benchley) and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==

In the New England beach town of Amity Island, a young woman goes for a late-night ocean swim during a beach party. An unseen force attacks and pulls her underwater. Her partially eaten remains are found washed up on the beach the next morning. After the coroner concludes she was the victim of a shark attack, Amity police chief Martin Brody closes the beaches; Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing the town&#x27;s summer economy will suffer. The coroner, apparently under pressure, now concurs with the mayor&#x27;s theory that it was a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until a young boy, Alex Kintner, is killed at a crowded beach. A $3000 bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Quint, an eccentric and crusty local shark hunter, offers his services for $10,000. Consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines the girl&#x27;s remains, confirming that she was killed by an unusually large shark.

When local fishermen catch a tiger shark, Vaughn declares the beaches safe. A skeptical Hooper dissects the tiger shark and, finding no human remains inside its stomach, concludes that the killer shark is still out there. While searching the night waters in Hooper&#x27;s boat, Hooper and Brody find the half-sunken boat of Ben Gardner, a local fisherman. Hooper dons a scuba suit and goes underwater to check the boat&#x27;s hull, where he finds a large shark tooth embedded into it. He accidentally drops the tooth in fright after encountering Gardner&#x27;s corpse. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper&#x27;s assertions that a great white shark caused the deaths and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. The shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and nearly killing Brody&#x27;s son, Michael who is hospitalized with shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to hire Quint.

Despite initial tension between Quint and Hooper, as well as Brody&#x27;s fear of the ocean, the three head out to sea on Quint&#x27;s boat, the &quot;Orca&quot;, to hunt for the shark. As Brody lays down a chum line, the shark suddenly appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating it is long and weighs , harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.

At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted body scars. One of Quint&#x27;s is a removed tattoo, and he reveals that during World War II, he survived the sinking of the , during which many US sailors were killed by sharks. The shark returns, ramming the boat&#x27;s hull and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. As Quint is about to sever the line to save the boat&#x27;s transom, the cleats break off. The barrels stay attached to the shark. To Brody&#x27;s relief, Quint speeds the &quot;Orca&quot; toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but the damaged engine is overtaxed and fails.

As the boat takes on water, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper suits up and enters a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark viciously attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear. While the shark destroys the cage, Hooper escapes to the ocean bottom. The shark leaps onto the boat&#x27;s stern, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody shoves a scuba tank into the shark&#x27;s mouth and, climbing onto the crow&#x27;s nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces and he and Brody paddle back to shore, clinging to the remaining barrels.

==Production==

===Development===

Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown, producers at Universal Pictures, independently heard about Peter Benchley&#x27;s novel &quot;Jaws&quot;. Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, then edited by his wife, Helen Gurley Brown. A small card written by the magazine&#x27;s book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment &quot;might make a good movie&quot;. The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was &quot;the most exciting thing that they had ever read&quot; and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished. They purchased the film rights in 1973, before the book&#x27;s publication, for approximately $175,000 (). Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.

To direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker John Sturges—whose résumé included another maritime adventure, &#x27;—before offering the job to Dick Richards, whose directorial debut, &quot;The Culpepper Cattle Co.&quot;, had come out the previous year. They soon grew irritated by Richards&#x27;s habit of describing the shark as a whale and dropped him from the project. Meanwhile, Steven Spielberg very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;, for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated. He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film &#x27; in that both deal with &quot;these leviathans targeting everymen&quot;. He also revealed in &quot;The Making of &quot;Jaws&quot;&quot; documentary on the 2012 DVD release that he directly referenced &quot;Duel&quot; by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark. After Richards&#x27;s departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;.

Before production began, Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with &quot;Jaws&quot;, in fear of becoming typecast as the &quot;truck and shark director&quot;. He wanted to move over to 20th Century Fox&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure. Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that &quot;after [&quot;Jaws&quot;], you can make all the films you want&quot;. The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5 million and a shooting schedule of 55 days. Principal photography was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios&#x27; contract with the Screen Actors Guild was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.

===Writing===

For the screen adaptation, Spielberg wanted to stay with the novel&#x27;s basic plot, but discarded many of Benchley&#x27;s subplots. He declared that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120 pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, &quot;I&#x27;d like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third.&quot; When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the screenplay. The intent was to make sure a script could be done despite an impending threat of a Writer&#x27;s Guild strike, given Benchley was not unionized. Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers; delivering his final version to Spielberg, he declared, &quot;I&#x27;m written out on this, and that&#x27;s the best I can do.&quot; Benchley later described his contribution to the finished film as &quot;the storyline and the ocean stuff—basically, the mechanics&quot;, given he &quot;didn&#x27;t know how to put the character texture into a screenplay.&quot; One of his changes was to remove the novel&#x27;s adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the &quot;Orca&quot;. During the film&#x27;s production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.

Spielberg, who felt that the characters in Benchley&#x27;s script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter John Byrum to do a rewrite, but he declined the offer. &quot;Columbo&quot; creators William Link and Richard Levinson also declined Spielberg&#x27;s invitation. Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Howard Sackler was in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite; since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley&#x27;s drafts, they quickly agreed. At the suggestion of Spielberg, Brody&#x27;s characterization made him afraid of water, &quot;coming from an urban jungle to find something more terrifying off this placid island near Massachusetts.&quot;

Spielberg wanted &quot;some levity&quot; in &quot;Jaws&quot;, humor that would avoid making it &quot;a dark sea hunt&quot;, so he turned to his friend Carl Gottlieb, a comedy writer-actor then working on the sitcom &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be interested in performing. Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes, and picked the part of Meadows, the politically connected editor of the local paper. He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job.

While the deal was initially for a &quot;one-week dialogue polish&quot;, Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting nearly the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography. The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg and members of the cast and crew to decide what would go into the film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors&#x27; improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set just prior to filming. John Milius contributed other dialogue polishes, and &quot;Sugarland Express&quot; writers Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood also made uncredited contributions. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material. One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark&#x27;s death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a &quot;big rousing ending&quot;. The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.

Benchley had written &quot;Jaws&quot; after reading about sport fisherman Frank Mundus&#x27;s capture of an enormous shark in 1964. According to Gottlieb, Quint was loosely based on Mundus, whose book &quot;Sportfishing for Sharks&quot; he read for research. Sackler came up with the backstory of Quint as a survivor of the World War II disaster. The question of who deserves the most credit for writing Quint&#x27;s monologue about the &quot;Indianapolis&quot; has caused substantial controversy. Spielberg described it as a collaboration between Sackler, Milius, and actor Robert Shaw, who was also a playwright. According to the director, Milius turned Sackler&#x27;s &quot;three-quarters of a page&quot; speech into a monologue, and that was then partially rewritten by Shaw. Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius&#x27;s contribution.

===Casting===

Though Spielberg complied with a request from Zanuck and Brown to cast known actors, he wanted to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that &quot;somewhat anonymous&quot; performers would help the audience &quot;believe this was happening to people like you and me&quot;, whereas &quot;stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes ... corrupt the story.&quot; The director added that in his plans &quot;the superstar was gonna be the shark&quot;. The first actors cast were Lorraine Gary, the wife of Universal president, Sidney Sheinberg, as Ellen Brody, and Murray Hamilton as the mayor of Amity Island. Stuntwoman-turned-actress Susan Backlinie was cast as Chrissie (the first victim) as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude. Most minor roles were played by residents of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, where the film was shot. One example was Deputy Hendricks, played by future television producer Jeffrey Kramer. Lee Fierro plays Mrs. Kintner, the mother of the shark&#x27;s second victim Alex Kintner (played by Jeffrey Voorhees).

The role of Brody was offered to Robert Duvall, but the actor was interested only in portraying Quint. Charlton Heston expressed a desire for the role but Spielberg felt that Heston would bring a screen persona too grand for the part of a police chief of a modest community. Roy Scheider became interested in the project after overhearing Spielberg at a party talk with a screenwriter about having the shark jump up onto a boat. Spielberg was apprehensive about hiring Scheider, fearing he would portray a &quot;tough guy&quot;, similar to his role in &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

Nine days before the start of production, neither Quint nor Hooper had been cast. The role of Quint was originally offered to actors Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden, both of whom passed. Zanuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on &quot;The Sting&quot;, and suggested him to Spielberg. Shaw was reluctant to take the role since he did not like the book but decided to accept at the urging of both his wife, actress Mary Ure and his secretary—&quot;The last time they were that enthusiastic was &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. And they were right&quot;. Shaw based his performance on fellow cast member Craig Kingsbury, a local fisherman, farmer and legendary eccentric, who was cast in the small role of fisherman Ben Gardner. Spielberg described Kingsbury as &quot;the purest version of who, in my mind, Quint was&quot; and some of his offscreen utterances were incorporated into the script as lines of both Gardner and Quint. Another source for some of Quint&#x27;s dialogue and mannerisms, especially in the third act at sea, was Vineyard mechanic and boat-owner Lynn Murphy.

For the role of Hooper, Spielberg initially wanted Jon Voight. Timothy Bottoms, Jan-Michael Vincent, Joel Grey, and Jeff Bridges were also considered for the part. Spielberg&#x27;s friend George Lucas suggested Richard Dreyfuss, whom he had directed in &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. The actor initially passed but changed his decision after he attended a pre-release screening of &quot;The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz&quot;, which he had just completed. Disappointed in his performance and fearing that no one would want to hire him once &quot;Kravitz&quot; was released, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in &quot;Jaws&quot;. Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchley&#x27;s novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it. As a result of the casting, Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor, as well as to be more representative of Spielberg, who came to view Dreyfuss as his &quot;alter ego&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography began May 2, 1974, on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts, selected after consideration was given to eastern Long Island. Brown explained later that the production &quot;needed a vacation area that was lower middle class enough so that an appearance of a shark would destroy the tourist business.&quot; Martha&#x27;s Vineyard was also chosen because the surrounding ocean had a sandy bottom that never dropped below for out from shore, which allowed the mechanical sharks to operate while also beyond sight of land. As Spielberg wanted to film the aquatic sequences relatively close-up to resemble what people see while swimming, cinematographer Bill Butler devised new equipment to facilitate marine and underwater shooting, including a rig to keep the camera stable, regardless of tide, and a sealed submersible camera box. Spielberg asked the art department to avoid red in both scenery and wardrobe, so that the blood from the attacks would be the only red element and cause a bigger shock.
Initially the film&#x27;s producers wanted to train a great white shark but quickly realized this was not possible, so three full-size pneumatically powered prop sharks—which the film crew nicknamed &quot;Bruce&quot; after Spielberg&#x27;s lawyer, Bruce Ramer—were made for the production: a &quot;sea-sled shark&quot;, a full-body prop with its belly missing that was towed with a line, and two &quot;platform sharks&quot;, one that moved from camera-left to right (with its hidden left side exposing an array of pneumatic hoses), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered. The sharks were designed by art director and production designer Joe Alves during the third quarter of 1973. Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper&#x27;s Motion Picture &amp; Equipment Rental in Sun Valley, California. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in &quot;&quot;. After the sharks were completed, they were trucked to the shooting location. In early July, the platform used to tow the two side-view sharks capsized as it was being lowered to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it. The model required 14 operators to control all of the moving parts. For Quint&#x27;s boat, the &quot;Orca&quot;, Alves and his team constructed two identical 42-foot models for the film. The second boat, dubbed &quot;Orca II&quot;, had no motor and was designed to sink on command.

&quot;Jaws&quot; was the first major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, resulting in a troubled shoot, and went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget &quot;was $4 million and the picture wound up costing $9 million&quot;; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname &quot;Flaws&quot;. Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; &quot;I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same,&quot; he said. As for his lack of experience: &quot;I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank.&quot; Gottlieb said that &quot;there was nothing to do except make the movie&quot;, so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer he did not have to attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived &quot;ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water&quot;.

Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras got soaked, and the &quot;Orca&quot; once began to sink with the actors on board. The prop sharks frequently malfunctioned owing to a series of problems including bad weather, pneumatic hoses taking on salt water, frames fracturing due to water resistance, corroding skin, and electrolysis. From the first water test onward, the &quot;non-absorbent&quot; neoprene foam that made up the sharks&#x27; skin soaked up liquid, causing the sharks to balloon, and the sea-sled model frequently got entangled among forests of seaweed. Spielberg later calculated that during the 12-hour daily work schedule, on average only four hours were actually spent filming. Gottlieb was nearly decapitated by the boat&#x27;s propellers, and Dreyfuss was almost imprisoned in the steel cage. The actors were frequently seasick. Shaw also fled to Canada whenever he could due to tax problems, engaged in binge drinking, and developed a grudge against Dreyfuss, who was getting rave reviews for his performance in &quot;Duddy Kravitz&quot;. Editor Verna Fields rarely had material to work with during principal photography, as according to Spielberg &quot;we would shoot five scenes in a good day, three in an average day, and none in a bad day.&quot;
The delays proved beneficial in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes so that the shark was only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels. The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie, but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin. This forced restraint is widely thought to have added to the film&#x27;s suspense. As Spielberg put it years later, &quot;The film went from a Japanese Saturday matinee horror flick to more of a Hitchcock, the less-you-see-the-more-you-get thriller.&quot; In another interview, he similarly declared, &quot;The shark not working was a godsend. It made me become more like Alfred Hitchcock than like Ray Harryhausen.&quot; The acting became crucial for making audiences believe in such a big shark: &quot;The more fake the shark looked in the water, the more my anxiety told me to heighten the naturalism of the performances.&quot;

Footage of real sharks was shot by Ron and Valerie Taylor in the waters off Dangerous Reef in South Australia, with a short actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were enormous. During the Taylors&#x27; shoot, a great white attacked the boat and cage. The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film. No one had been in the cage at the time and the script, following the novel, originally had the shark killing Hooper in it. The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage, which allowed the footage to be used. As production executive Bill Gilmore put it, &quot;The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss&#x27;s character.&quot;

Although principal photography was scheduled to take 55 days, it did not wrap until October 6, 1974, after 159 days. Spielberg, reflecting on the protracted shoot, stated, &quot;I thought my career as a filmmaker was over. I heard rumors ... that I would never work again because no one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule.&quot; Spielberg himself was not present for the shooting of the final scene in which the shark explodes, as he believed that the crew were planning to throw him in the water when the scene was done. It has since become a tradition for Spielberg to be absent when the final scene of one of his films is being shot. Afterward, underwater scenes were shot at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer water tank in Culver City, with stuntmen Dick Warlock and Frank James Sparks as stand-ins for Dreyfuss in the scene where the shark attacks the cage, as well as near Santa Catalina Island, California. Fields, who had completed a rough cut of the first two-thirds of the film, up until the shark hunt, finished the editing and reworked some of the material. According to Zanuck, &quot;She actually came in and reconstructed some scenes that Steven had constructed for comedy and made them terrifying, and some scenes he shot to be terrifying and made them comedy scenes.&quot; The boat used for the &quot;Orca&quot; was brought to Los Angeles so the sound effects team could record sounds for both the ship and the underwater scenes.

Two scenes were altered following test screenings. As the audience&#x27;s screams had covered up Scheider&#x27;s &quot;bigger boat&quot; one-liner, Brody&#x27;s reaction after the shark jumps behind him was extended, and the volume of the line was raised. Spielberg also decided that he was greedy for &quot;one more scream&quot;, and reshot the scene in which Hooper discovers Ben Gardner&#x27;s body, using $3,000 of his own money after Universal refused to pay for the reshoot. The underwater scene was shot in Fields&#x27;s swimming pool in Encino, California, using a lifecast latex model of Craig Kingsbury&#x27;s head attached to a fake body, which was placed in the wrecked boat&#x27;s hull. To simulate the murky waters of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, powdered milk was poured into the pool, which was then covered with a tarpaulin.

==Music==
John Williams composed the film&#x27;s score, which earned him an Academy Award and was later ranked the sixth-greatest score by the American Film Institute. The main &quot;shark&quot; theme, a simple alternating pattern of two notes—variously identified as &quot;E and F&quot; or &quot;F and F sharp&quot;—became a classic piece of suspense music, synonymous with approaching danger (see leading-tone). Williams described the theme as &quot;grinding away at you, just as a shark would do, instinctual, relentless, unstoppable.&quot; The piece was performed by tuba player Tommy Johnson. When asked by Johnson why the melody was written in such a high register and not played by the more appropriate French horn, Williams responded that he wanted it to sound &quot;a little more threatening&quot;. When Williams first demonstrated his idea to Spielberg, playing just the two notes on a piano, Spielberg was said to have laughed, thinking that it was a joke. As Williams saw similarities between &quot;Jaws&quot; and pirate movies, at other points in the score he evoked &quot;pirate music&quot;, which he called &quot;primal, but fun and entertaining&quot;. Calling for rapid, percussive string playing, the score contains echoes of Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La mer&quot; and of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;.

There are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme, which is widely described as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time. Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two-note expression mimics the shark&#x27;s heartbeat. According to Alexandre Tylski, like themes Bernard Herrmann wrote for &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, and particularly &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;, it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the score&#x27;s strongest motif is actually &quot;the split, the rupture&quot;—when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissie&#x27;s death. The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme, which is exploited toward the film&#x27;s climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction.

Spielberg later said that without Williams&#x27;s score the film would have been only half as successful, and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career. He had previously scored Spielberg&#x27;s debut feature, &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot;, and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films. The original soundtrack for &quot;Jaws&quot; was released by MCA Records on LP in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score, and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.

==Themes==

===Influences===
Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is the most notable artistic antecedent to &quot;Jaws&quot;. The character of Quint strongly resembles Captain Ahab, the obsessed captain of the &quot;Pequod&quot; who devotes his life to hunting a sperm whale. Quint&#x27;s monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the &quot;Orca&quot;, is named after the only natural enemy of the white shark. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville&#x27;s novel. A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg&#x27;s draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the film version of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; could not be licensed from the film&#x27;s star, Gregory Peck, its copyright holder. Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;: &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; is ... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.&quot;

The underwater scenes shot from the shark&#x27;s point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot; and &quot;The Monster That Challenged the World&quot;. Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: &quot;The Thing from Another World&quot;, which Gottlieb described as &quot;a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel&quot;; and &quot;It Came From Outer Space&quot;, where &quot;the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera&quot;. Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to &quot;concentrate on showing the &#x27;effects&#x27; of the shark rather than the shark itself&quot;. Scholars such as Thomas Schatz have described how &quot;Jaws&quot; melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with the core of a nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half is both a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the &quot;Orca&quot;, and a supernatural horror based on the shark&#x27;s depiction of a nearly Satanic menace. Ian Freer describes &quot;Jaws&quot; as an aquatic monster movie, citing the influence of earlier monster films such as &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot;. Charles Derry, in 1977, also compared &quot;Jaws&quot; to &quot;Godzilla&quot;; and Spielberg cited &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; (1956) as a formative influence growing up, due to the &quot;masterful&quot; way in which &quot;it made you believe it was really happening.&quot;

Critics such as Neil Sinyard have described similarities to Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;. Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to &quot;Jaws&quot; as &quot;&quot;Moby-Dick&quot; meets &quot;Enemy of the People&quot;&quot;. The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town&#x27;s medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in &quot;Jaws&quot; by Brody&#x27;s conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a &quot;deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen&#x27;s play&quot;.

===Scholarly criticism===
&quot;Jaws&quot; has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film&#x27;s ideological meanings to the then-recent Watergate scandal. He argues that Brody represents the &quot;white male middle class—[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film&quot;, who restores public order &quot;with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency&quot;. Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine &quot;Jaws&quot; as a signal example of the film as &quot;industrial product&quot; that sells on the basis of &quot;the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of &quot;Jaws&quot; is to be the most profitable movie)&quot;.

Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel&#x27;s post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper&#x27;s survival, the shark&#x27;s explosive death) help make it &quot;a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.&quot; He suggests that the experience of the film is &quot;inconceivable&quot; without the mass audience&#x27;s jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself. In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that &quot;individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change&quot;. Peter Biskind argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town&#x27;s venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by New Hollywood filmmakers of the era—involving Us vs. Them, hip counterculture figures vs. &quot;The Man&quot;—the overarching conflict in &quot;Jaws&quot; does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.

Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel&#x27;s theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island, Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. &quot;Authority must be restored&quot;, he writes, &quot;but not by Quint&quot;. The seaman&#x27;s &quot;working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening ... irrational and out of control&quot;. Hooper, meanwhile, is &quot;associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency&quot;; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint. Britton sees the film more as concerned with the &quot;vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them&quot;, which in turn helps generate a &quot;pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity&quot;.

Fredric Jameson&#x27;s analysis highlights the polysemy of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very &quot;polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently &#x27;natural&#x27; ones ... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.&quot; He views Quint&#x27;s demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hooper&#x27;s partnership as an &quot;allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations ... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.&quot;

Neal Gabler analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody). The last of the three is the one which succeeds and is in that way endorsed by the film.

===Audience emotional response===
While in theaters, the film was said to have caused a single case of cinematic neurosis in a 17-year-old, female viewer. Cinematic neurosis is a condition in which viewers exhibit mental health disturbances, or a worsening of existing mental health disturbances, after viewing a film. The symptoms first presented as sleep disturbances and anxiety, but one day later the patient was screaming &quot;Sharks! Sharks!&quot; and experiencing convulsions.

This case study caused the film to become notable in the medical community alongside &quot;The Exorcist&quot; for causing stress reactions in its viewers, and was later used in a study by Brian R. Johnson to test how susceptible audiences were to cinematic stress inducers. His study found that stress could be induced by cinema in segments of the general population, and &quot;Jaws&quot; specifically caused stress reactions in its viewers. While Johnson could not find an exact cause for the stress response in viewers, whether it be the suspense, the gore or the music production, a 1986 study by G. Sparks found that particularly violent films, including &quot;Jaws&quot;, tended to cause the most intense reactions in viewers.

==Release==

===Marketing===
Universal spent $1.8 million marketing &quot;Jaws&quot;, including an unprecedented $700,000 on national television spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film&#x27;s opening two days later. Beyond that, in the description of film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal &quot;devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan&quot; for the picture&#x27;s marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint marketing strategy were John Williams&#x27;s theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback&#x27;s cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that &quot;no matter what we did, it didn&#x27;t look scary enough&quot;. Seiniger ultimately decided that &quot;you had to actually go underneath the shark so you could see his teeth.&quot;

More merchandise was created to take advantage of the film&#x27;s release. In 1999, Graeme Turner wrote that &quot;Jaws&quot; was accompanied by what was &quot;probably the most elaborate array of tie-ins&quot; including &quot;a sound-track album, T-shirts, plastic tumblers, a book about the making of the movie, the book the movie was based on, beach towels, blankets, shark costumes, toy sharks, hobby kits, iron-on transfers, games, posters, shark&#x27;s tooth necklaces, sleepwear, water pistols, and more.&quot; The Ideal Toy Company, for instance, produced a game in which the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the shark&#x27;s mouth before the jaws closed.

===Theatrical run===
The glowing audience response to a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March 26, 1975, and one in Long Beach, on March 28, along with the success of Benchley&#x27;s novel and the early stages of Universal&#x27;s marketing campaign, generated great interest among theater owners, facilitating the studio&#x27;s plan to debut &quot;Jaws&quot; at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously. A third and final preview screening, of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations, was held in Hollywood on April 24. After Universal chairman Lew Wasserman attended one of the screenings, he ordered the film&#x27;s initial release—planned for a massive total of as many as 900 theaters—to be cut down, declaring, &quot;I want this picture to run all summer long. I don&#x27;t want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs. I want them to have to get in their cars and drive to see it in Hollywood.&quot; Nonetheless, the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually wide release. At the time, wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality; not uncommon on the exploitation side of the industry, they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth. There had been some recent exceptions, including the rerelease of &quot;Billy Jack&quot; and the original release of its sequel &quot;The Trial of Billy Jack&quot;, the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; sequel &quot;Magnum Force&quot;, and the latest installments in the James Bond series. Still, the typical major studio film release at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of &quot;The Godfather&quot; in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend.

On June 20, &quot;Jaws&quot; opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the remainder in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie&#x27;s then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures had done something similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, &quot;Breakout&quot;, though that film&#x27;s prospects for an extended run were much slimmer, and it is today a common misconception that Jaws was the first to use an ad saturation strategy.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film&#x27;s success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, &quot;Jaws&quot; opened in December at more than 100 theaters.

For its 40th anniversary, the film was released in selected theaters (across approximately 500 theaters) in the United States on Sunday, June 21, and Wednesday, June 24, 2015.
Another theatrical reissue was released on September 2, 2022, usually under the title &quot;Jaws in 3D&quot; (not to be confused with the second sequel, Jaws 3-D) with the film debuting in both IMAX and RealD 3D formats, as part of the 40th anniversary celebration of another Spielberg film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. On the announcement, Travis Reed of RealD 3D remarked: &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; redefined what it means to be a summer-event blockbuster and now for the first time ever audiences can experience Steven Spielberg&#x27;s motion picture classic in 3D ... allowing fans a completely new opportunity to immerse themselves in one of the greatest summer suspense thrillers of all time.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Jaws&quot; opened in 409 theaters with a record $7 million weekend and grossed a record $21,116,354 in its first 10 days recouping its production costs. It grossed $100 million in its first 59 days from 954 playdates. In just 78 days, it overtook &quot;The Godfather&quot; as the highest-grossing film at the North American box office, sailing past that picture&#x27;s earnings of $86 million, and became the first film to earn $100 million in US theatrical rentals. It spent 14 consecutive weeks as the number-one film in the United States. Its initial release ultimately brought in $123.1 million in rentals. Theatrical re-releases in 1976 and Summer 1979 brought its total rentals to $133.4 million.

The film entered overseas release in December 1975, and its international business mirrored its domestic performance. It broke records in Singapore, New Zealand, Japan, Spain, and Mexico. On January 11, 1976, &quot;Jaws&quot; became the highest-grossing film worldwide with rentals of $132 million, surpassing the $131 million earned by &quot;The Godfather&quot;. By the time of the third film in 1983, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that it had earned worldwide rentals of $270 million. &quot;Jaws&quot; was the highest-grossing film of all time until &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which debuted two years later. &quot;Star Wars&quot; surpassed &quot;Jaws&quot; for the U.S. record six months after its release and set a new global record in 1978.

Across all of its releases &quot;Jaws&quot; has grossed $476.5 million worldwide; adjusted for inflation, it has earned almost $2 billion at 2011 prices and is the second-most successful franchise film after &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Including its 2022 reissue, it has grossed $265.8 million in the United States and Canada, equivalent to $1.2 billion at 2020 prices (based on an estimated 128,078,800 tickets sold), making it the seventh-highest-grossing movie of all time adjusted for ticket price inflation. In the United Kingdom, it is the seventh-highest-grossing film to be released since 1975, earning the equivalent of over £70 million in 2009/10 currency, with admissions estimated at 16.2 million. &quot;Jaws&quot; has also sold 13 million tickets in Brazil, a quantity first surpassed by &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1998, and that still ranks as the sixth most attended film in the country.

On television, ABC aired it for the first time on November 4, 1979, right after its theatrical re-release. The first U.S. broadcast received a Nielsen rating of 39.1 and attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second-highest televised movie audience at the time behind &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and the fourth-highest rated. In the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second-biggest British TV audience ever for a feature film behind &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Jaws&quot; received mostly positive reviews upon release. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars, calling it &quot;a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it&#x27;s populated with characters that have been developed into human beings. It&#x27;s a film that&#x27;s as frightening as &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, and yet it&#x27;s a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun because we&#x27;re being scared by an outdoor-adventure saga instead of a brimstone-and-vomit devil.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s A. D. Murphy praised Spielberg&#x27;s directorial skills, and called Robert Shaw&#x27;s performance &quot;absolutely magnificent&quot;. According to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Pauline Kael, it was &quot;the most cheerfully perverse scare movie ever made ... [with] more zest than an early Woody Allen picture, a lot more electricity, [and] it&#x27;s funny in a Woody Allen sort of way&quot;. For &quot;New Times&quot; magazine, Frank Rich wrote, &quot;Spielberg is blessed with a talent that is absurdly absent from most American filmmakers these days: this man actually knows how to tell a story on screen. ... It speaks well of this director&#x27;s gifts that some of the most frightening sequences in &quot;Jaws&quot; are those where we don&#x27;t even see the shark.&quot; Writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Judith Crist described the film as &quot;an exhilarating adventure entertainment of the highest order&quot; and complimented its acting and &quot;extraordinary technical achievements&quot;. Rex Reed praised the &quot;nerve-frying&quot; action scenes and concluded that &quot;for the most part, &quot;Jaws&quot; is a gripping horror film that works beautifully in every department&quot;. David Thomson wrote that &quot;like Coppola on &quot;The Godfather&quot;, Spielberg asserted his own role and deftly organized the elements of a roller coaster entertainment without sacrificing inner meanings. The suspense of the picture came from meticulous technique and good humor about its own surgical cutting. You have only to submit to the travesty of &quot;Jaws 2&quot; to realize how much more engagingly Spielberg saw the ocean, the perils, the sinister beauty of the shark, and the vitality of its human opponents.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark&#x27;s victims. ... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like &quot;Jaws&quot;, characters are simply functions of the action ... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it&#x27;s necessary&quot;. He did describe it as &quot;the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Charles Champlin disagreed with the film&#x27;s PG rating, saying that &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. ... It is a coarse-grained and exploitative work which depends on excess for its impact. Ashore it is a bore, awkwardly staged and lumpily written.&quot; Marcia Magill of &quot;Films in Review&quot; said that while &quot;Jaws&quot; &quot;is eminently worth seeing for its second half&quot;, she felt that before the protagonists&#x27; pursuit of the shark the film was &quot;often flawed by its busyness&quot;. William S. Pechter of &quot;Commentary&quot; described &quot;Jaws&quot; as &quot;a mind-numbing repast for sense-sated gluttons&quot; and &quot;filmmaking of this essentially manipulative sort&quot;; Molly Haskell of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; similarly characterized it as a &quot;scare machine that works with computer-like precision. ... You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy&quot;. The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that &quot;the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up&quot;, and in 2002, online reviewer James Berardinelli said that if not for Spielberg&#x27;s deftly suspenseful direction, &quot;we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature.&quot; &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; stated that &quot;despite genuinely suspenseful and frightening sequences, it is a slackly narrated and sometimes flatly handled thriller with an over-abundance of dialogue and, when it finally appears, a pretty unconvincing monster.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Jaws&quot; won three Academy Awards, those being for Best Film Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery, and John Carter). It was also nominated for Best Picture, losing to &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. Spielberg greatly resented the fact that he was not nominated for Best Director.

Along with the Oscar, John Williams&#x27;s score won the Grammy Award, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, and the Golden Globe Award. To her Academy Award, Verna Fields added the American Cinema Editors&#x27; Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film. The film was voted Favorite Movie at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

It was also nominated for Best Film, Director, Actor (Richard Dreyfuss), Screenplay, Editing and Sound at the 29th British Academy Film Awards, and Best Motion Picture–Drama, Director and Screenplay at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. Spielberg was nominated by the Directors Guild of America for the DGA Award, and the Writers Guild of America nominated Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb&#x27;s script for Best Adapted Drama.

==Home media==
The first ever LaserDisc title marketed in North America was the MCA DiscoVision release of &quot;Jaws&quot; in 1978. A second LaserDisc was released in 1992, before a third and final version came out under MCA/Universal Home Video&#x27;s Signature Collection imprint in 1995. This release was an elaborate box-set that included deleted scenes and outtakes, a new two-hour documentary on the making of the film directed and produced by Laurent Bouzereau, a copy of the novel &quot;Jaws&quot;, and a CD of the soundtrack by John Williams.

MCA Home Video first released &quot;Jaws&quot; on VHS in 1980. For the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 1995, MCA Universal Home Video issued a new Collector&#x27;s Edition tape featuring a making-of retrospective. This release sold 800,000 units in North America. Another, final VHS release, marking the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2000, came with a companion tape containing a documentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a trailer.

&quot;Jaws&quot; was first released on DVD in 2000 for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, accompanied by a massive publicity campaign. It featured a 50-minute documentary on the making of the film (an edited version of that featured on the 1995 LaserDisc release), with interviews with Spielberg, Scheider, Dreyfuss, Benchley, and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards. The DVD shipped one million copies in just one month. In June 2005, a 30th anniversary edition was released at the JawsFest festival on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. The new DVD had many extras seen in previous home video releases, including the full two-hour Bouzereau documentary, and a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of &quot;Jaws&quot; in 1974. On the second JawsFest in August 2012, the Blu-ray Disc of &quot;Jaws&quot; was released, with over four hours of extras, including &quot;The Shark Is Still Working&quot;. The Blu-ray release was part of the celebrations of Universal&#x27;s 100th anniversary, and debuted at fourth place in the charts, with over 362,000 units sold. The film was released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on 1 June 2020.

==Legacy==
===Impact on the film industry===
&quot;Jaws&quot; was key in establishing the benefits of a wide national release backed by heavy television advertising, rather than the traditional progressive release in which a film slowly entered new markets and built support over time. Saturation booking, in which a film opens simultaneously at thousands of theaters, and massive media buys are now commonplace for the major Hollywood studios. According to Peter Biskind, &quot;Jaws&quot; &quot;diminished the importance of print reviews, making it virtually impossible for a film to build slowly, finding its audience by dint of mere quality. ... Moreover, &quot;Jaws&quot; whet corporate appetites for big profits quickly, which is to say, studios wanted every film to be &quot;Jaws&quot;.&quot; Scholar Thomas Schatz writes that it &quot;recalibrated the profit potential of the Hollywood hit, and redefined its status as a marketable commodity and cultural phenomenon as well. The film brought an emphatic end to Hollywood&#x27;s five-year recession, while ushering in an era of high-cost, high-tech, high-speed thrillers.&quot;

&quot;Jaws&quot; also played a major part in establishing summer as the prime season for the release of studios&#x27; biggest box-office contenders, their intended blockbusters; winter had long been the time when most hoped-for hits were distributed, while summer was largely reserved for dumping films thought likely to be poor performers. &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; are regarded as marking the beginning of the new U.S. film industry business model dominated by &quot;high-concept&quot; pictures—with premises that can be easily described and marketed—as well as the beginning of the end of the New Hollywood period, which saw auteur films increasingly disregarded in favor of profitable big-budget pictures. The New Hollywood era was defined by the relative autonomy filmmakers were able to attain within the major studio system; in Biskind&#x27;s description, &quot;Spielberg was the Trojan horse through which the studios began to reassert their power.&quot;

The film had broader cultural repercussions, as well. Similar to the way the pivotal scene in 1960&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; made showers a new source of anxiety, &quot;Jaws&quot; led many viewers to fear going into the ocean. Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it, as well as more reported shark sightings. It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior, and for producing the so-called &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; effect&quot;, which allegedly inspired &quot;legions of fishermen [who] piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments.&quot; Benchley would later campaign to stop the depopulation of sharks, saying that &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; was entirely a fiction&quot;. Spielberg later echoed this sentiment, saying that he regretted &quot;the decimation of the shark population because of the book and the film&quot;. Conservation groups have bemoaned the fact that the film has made it considerably harder to convince the public that sharks should be protected.

&quot;Jaws&quot; set the template for many subsequent horror films, to the extent that the script for Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 science fiction film &quot;Alien&quot; was pitched to studio executives as &quot;&quot;Jaws&quot; in space&quot;. Many films based on man-eating animals, usually aquatic, were released through the 1970s and 1980s, such as &quot;Orca&quot;, &quot;Grizzly&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Barracuda&quot;, &quot;Alligator&quot;, &quot;Day of the Animals&quot;, &quot;Tintorera&quot;, and &quot;Eaten Alive&quot;. Spielberg declared &quot;Piranha&quot;, directed by Joe Dante and written by John Sayles, &quot;the best of the &quot;Jaws&quot; ripoffs&quot;. Among the various foreign mockbusters based on &quot;Jaws&quot;, three came from Italy: &quot;Great White&quot;, which inspired a plagiarism lawsuit by Universal and was even marketed in some countries as a part of the &quot;Jaws&quot; franchise; &quot;Monster Shark&quot;, featured in &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; under the title &quot;Devil Fish&quot;; and &quot;Deep Blood&quot;, which blends in a supernatural element. The 1976 Brazilian film &quot;Bacalhau&quot; parodies &quot;Jaws&quot;, featuring a killer cod in place of a shark. The 2009 Japanese horror film &quot;Psycho Shark&quot; was released in the United States as &quot;Jaws in Japan&quot;. Filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki cited &quot;Jaws&quot; and Spielberg as an influence for his 2023 Japanese &quot;kaiju&quot; film &quot;Godzilla Minus One&quot;.

===Rankings===
In the years since its release, &quot;Jaws&quot; has frequently been cited by film critics and industry professionals as one of the greatest movies of all time. It was number 48 on American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years ... 100 Movies&quot;, a list of the greatest American films of all time compiled in 1998; it dropped to number 56 on the 10th Anniversary list. AFI also ranked the shark at number 18 on its list of the 50 Best Villains, Roy Scheider&#x27;s line &quot;You&#x27;re gonna need a bigger boat&quot; 35th on a list of top 100 movie quotes, Williams&#x27;s score at sixth on a list of 100 Years of Film Scores, and the film as second on a list of 100 most thrilling films, behind only &quot;Psycho&quot;. In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; included the film on its list of the best 1,000 movies ever made. The following year, &quot;Jaws&quot; placed at the top of the Bravo network&#x27;s five-hour miniseries &quot;The 100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot;. The Chicago Film Critics Association named it the sixth-scariest film ever made in 2006. In 2008, &quot;Jaws&quot; was ranked the fifth-greatest film in history by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, which also placed Quint at number 50 on its list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time. The film has been cited in many other lists of 50 and 100 greatest films, including ones compiled by Leonard Maltin, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Film4&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Total Film&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;.

In 2001, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, recognizing it as a landmark horror film and the first &quot;summer movie&quot;. In 2006, its screenplay was ranked the 63rd-best of all time by the Writers Guild of America. In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the eighth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership.

===Adaptations and merchandise===

The film has inspired two theme park rides: one at Universal Studios Florida, which closed in January 2012, and one at Universal Studios Japan. There is also an animatronic version of a scene from the film on the Studio Tour at Universal Studios Hollywood. There have been at least two musical adaptations: &quot;JAWS The Musical!&quot;, which premiered in 2004 at the Minnesota Fringe Festival, and &quot;Giant Killer Shark: The Musical&quot;, which premiered in 2006 at the Toronto Fringe Festival. Three video games based on the film were released: 1987&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;, developed by LJN for the Nintendo Entertainment System; 2006&#x27;s &quot;Jaws Unleashed&quot; by Majesco Entertainment for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and PC; and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Jaws: Ultimate Predator&quot;, also by Majesco, for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii. A mobile game was released in 2010 for the iPhone. Aristocrat made an officially licensed slot machine based on the movie.

In 2017, video game developer Zen Studios developed and released a virtual pinball adaptation of the film as part of the Universal Classics add-on pack for the virtual pinball game &quot;Pinball FX 3&quot;. This table features 3-D figures of Quint and Jaws, with the opportunity to play missions from either character&#x27;s perspective. This table was remastered for &quot;Pinball FX&quot; on March 31, 2022.

The musical &quot;Bruce&quot;, based on Carl Gottlieb&#x27;s book &quot;The Jaws Log&quot;, had its world premiere at the Seattle Rep theatre from May 27 to July 3, 2022. The musical covers the difficulties Spielberg encountered making the movie, including the ongoing issues with the titular mechanical shark.

Lego released a set based on the scene where Bruce attacks the Orca with Chief Martin Brody, Matt Hooper, and Sam Quint. The set was released in August 2024 and features 1,497 pieces.

===Tributes===
Richard Dreyfuss made a cameo appearance in the 2010 film &quot;Piranha 3D&quot;, a loose remake of the 1978 film. Dreyfuss plays Matt Boyd, a fisherman who is the first victim of the title creatures. Dreyfuss later stated that his character was a parody and a near-reincarnation of Matt Hooper, his character in &quot;Jaws&quot;. During his appearance, Dreyfuss&#x27;s character listens to the song &quot;Show Me the Way to Go Home&quot; on the radio, which Hooper, Quint and Brody sing together aboard the &quot;Orca&quot;.

Martha&#x27;s Vineyard celebrated the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2005 with a &quot;JawsFest&quot; festival, which had a second edition in 2012. An independent group of fans produced the feature-length documentary &quot;The Shark Is Still Working&quot;, featuring interviews with the film&#x27;s cast and crew. Narrated by Roy Scheider and dedicated to Peter Benchley, who died in 2006, it debuted at the 2009 Los Angeles United Film Festival.

Shaw&#x27;s son, Ian Shaw, co-wrote and starred as his father in the play &quot;The Shark Is Broken&quot; about the making of &quot;Jaws&quot;, which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2019 and transferred to the West End in October 2021.

On March 24, 2020, it was announced that Donna Feore will direct and choreograph &quot;Bruce&quot;, the musical retelling of the behind-the-scenes story of &quot;Jaws&quot;, with Richard Oberacker writing the musical book and lyrics and Robert Taylor working on the music. It was originally set to premiere in June 2021, but was pushed back to June 2022 at the Seattle Repertory Theatre.

On November 20, 2020, a replica of the shark, also called &quot;Bruce&quot;, was lifted into place at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in preparation for the museum&#x27;s April 2021 opening. It was expected to be a major attraction. Greg Nicotero spent seven months restoring Bruce, which had been created after the original three sharks were destroyed and was on display for 15 years at Universal Studios Hollywood. Bruce then spent 25 years in a junkyard, until the owner donated the shark to the museum in 2016.

==Sequels==
&quot;Jaws&quot; spawned three sequels to declining critical favor and commercial performance. Their combined domestic grosses amount to barely half of the first film&#x27;s. In October 1975, Spielberg declared to a film festival audience that &quot;making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick&quot;. Nonetheless, he did consider taking on the first sequel when its original director, John D. Hancock, was fired a few days into the shoot; ultimately, his obligations to &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, which he was working on with Dreyfuss, made it impossible. &quot;Jaws 2&quot; (1978) was eventually directed by Jeannot Szwarc, with Scheider, Gary, Hamilton, and Jeffrey Kramer reprising their roles. It is generally regarded as the best of the sequels.

&quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; (1983) does not feature any of the original actors, although it was directed by Joe Alves, who had served as art director and production designer, respectively, on the two preceding films. Starring Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett Jr., it was released to heavily negative reviews in 3D format. The effect did not transfer to television or home video, where it was renamed &quot;Jaws 3&quot;. &quot;&quot; (1987) was directed by Joseph Sargent, co-starred Michael Caine, and featured the return of Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed it among the worst sequels ever made.

While all three sequels made a profit at the box office (&quot;Jaws 2&quot; and &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; were among the top 20 highest-grossing films of their respective years), critics and audiences alike were largely dissatisfied with the films.

<doc id="74834" wikidata="Q210900" url="?curid=74834" title="Pedro de Alvarado">
<text>Pedro de Alvarado (; 1485 – 4 July 1541) was a Spanish conquistador and governor of Guatemala. He participated in the conquest of Cuba, in Juan de Grijalva&#x27;s exploration of the coasts of the Yucatán Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico, and in the conquest of the Aztec Empire led by Hernán Cortés. He is considered the conquistador of much of Central America, including Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and parts of Nicaragua.

Alvarado developed a reputation for greed and cruelty, and was accused of various crimes and abuses by natives and Spaniards alike. In 1541, while attempting to quell a native revolt, Alvarado was accidentally crushed by a horse, dying a few days later.

==Character and appearance==

Pedro de Alvarado was flamboyant and charismatic, and was both a brilliant military commander and a cruel, hardened man. He is described as having &quot;good features and bearing&quot;, and when presented with a picture of him, the Aztecs referred to him as Tōnatiuh. The Aztecs gave Alvarado this name because of his blond hair, and also his infamous temper. He was handsome, and presented an affable appearance, but was volatile and quick to anger.

He was ruthless in his dealings with the indigenous peoples he set out to conquer. Historians judge that his greed drove him to excessive cruelty, and his Spanish contemporaries denounced his extreme brutality during his lifetime. He was a poor governor of territories he had conquered, and restlessly sought out new adventures.

His tactical brutality, such as the massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, often undermined strategic considerations. He was also accused of cruelty against fellow Spaniards. Alvarado was little suited to govern; when he held governing positions, he did little to establish stable foundations for colonial rule. His letters show no interest in civil matters, and he only discussed exploration and war. Alvarado stubbornly resisted attempts by the Spanish Crown to establish ordered taxation in Guatemala, and refused to acknowledge such attempts. As governor of Guatemala, Alvarado has been described by W. George Lovell et al. as &quot;an insatiable despot who recognized no authority but his own and who regarded Guatemala as little more than his personal estate.&quot;

American historian William H. Prescott described Alvarado&#x27;s character in the following terms:

Spanish chronicler Antonio de Remesal commented that &quot;Alvarado desired more to be feared than loved by his subjects, whether they were Indians or Spaniards.&quot; In his easy recourse to violence, Alvarado was a product of his time, and Alvarado was not the only &quot;conquistador&quot; to have resorted to such actions. Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro carried out deeds of similar cruelty, but have not attracted as much criticism as Alvarado.

==Early life and family==
Pedro de Alvarado was born in 1485 in the town of Badajoz, Extremadura. His father was Gómez de Alvarado, and his mother was Leonor de Contreras, Gómez&#x27;s second wife. Pedro de Alvarado had a twin sister, Sarra, and four full-blood brothers, Jorge, Gonzalo, Gómez, and Juan. Pedro had an illegitimate half brother, also named Juan, referred to in contemporary sources as &quot;Juan el Bastardo&quot;.

Very little is known of Pedro de Alvarado&#x27;s early life before his arrival in the Americas. During the conquest of the Americas, tales of his youthful exploits in Spain became popular legends, but their veracity is doubtful. An example is the tale then current that when he was a youth awaiting passage to the Americas, he climbed the church tower in Seville with some friends. A banner pole extended some from an upper window. One of his companions walked out to the end of the pole after removing his cloak and sword, and returned to the tower backwards. Alvarado, afraid of being mocked, walked out onto the pole with both sword and cloak, and turned around at the end to return to the tower facing it.

Alvarado&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Juan Alvarado &quot;el Viejo&quot; (&quot;the elder&quot;), who was &quot;comendador&quot; of Hornachos, and his paternal grandmother was Catalina Messía. Pedro de Alvarado&#x27;s uncle on his father&#x27;s side was Diego de Alvarado y Messía, who was the &quot;comendador&quot; of Lobón, Puebla, and Montijo, &quot;alcalde&quot; of Montánchez, and lord of Castellanos and of Cubillana. Diego was a veteran of the campaigns against the Moors.

==First campaigns in the Americas==
Alvarado and his brothers crossed the Atlantic Ocean before 1511, possibly in 1510. By 1511 a system of licenses had been established in Spain to control the flow of colonists to the New World. The only one of the Alvarado brothers that appears in the registers is Juan de Alvarado, in 1511, leading to the assumption that the rest were already in the Americas by the time the licensing system was established. The Alvarado brothers stopped off at Hispaniola, but there are few mentions of their stay there in historical documents.

Soon after arriving in Santo Domingo, on Hispaniola, Pedro de Alvarado established a friendship with Hernán Cortés, who at the time was serving as public scribe. Alvarado joined Cortés to participate in the conquest of Cuba, under the command of Diego de Velázquez. The conquest of Cuba was launched in 1511, and Pedro de Alvarado was accompanied by his brothers. Soon after the invasion, Alvarado was managing a prosperous &quot;hacienda&quot; in the new colony. It is around this time that Pedro de Alvarado emerges into the historical record as a prosperous and influential &quot;hacienda&quot;-owner, already well connected with Velázquez, who was now governor of Cuba.

Diego Velázquez, the governor of Cuba, was enthused by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba&#x27;s report of gold in the newly discovered Yucatán Peninsula. He organised an expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in overall command; Pedro de Alvarado captained one of the ships. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread.

The fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off the east coast of Yucatán. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish; the fleet then sailed south from Cozumel, along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast. On Ascension Thursday the fleet discovered a large bay, which the Spanish named Bahía de la Ascensión.

Grijalva did not land at any of these cities and turned back north to loop around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. The Maya remained hidden in the forest, so the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.

At Champotón, the fleet was approached by a small number of large war canoes, but the ships&#x27; cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach. By means of interpreters, Grijalva indicated that he wished to trade and bartered wine and beads in exchange for food and other supplies. From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire, sailing as far north as Pánuco River.

At the Papaloapan River, Alvarado ordered his ship upriver, leaving the rest of the small fleet behind to wait for him at the river mouth. This action greatly angered Grijalva, who feared that a lone ship could be lost. After this, the Spanish referred to the river as the &quot;Río de Alvarado&quot; (&quot;Alvarado&#x27;s River&quot;). A little further along the coast, the fleet encountered settlements under Aztec dominion, and was met by Aztec emissaries with gifts of gold and jewels sent by the Emperor Moctezuma II.

As punishment for entering the Papaloapan River without orders, Grijalva sent Alvarado with the ship &quot;San Sebastián&quot; to relay news of the discoveries back to Cuba. Alvarado made a triumphal entry to Santiago de Cuba, with a great display of the wealth that had been gained from the expedition. His early arrival in Cuba allowed him to ingratiate himself with the Governor Velázquez before Grijalva&#x27;s return. The rest of the fleet put into the port of Havana five months after it had left. Grijalva was coldly received by the governor, who Alvarado had turned against him, claiming much of the glory of the expedition for himself.

==Expedition to Mexico, 1519==
Grijalva&#x27;s return aroused great interest in Cuba. A new expedition was organised, with a fleet of eleven ships carrying 500 men and some horses. Hernán Cortés was placed in command; Pedro de Alvarado and his brothers Jorge, Gómez and Juan &quot;El Bastardo&quot; joined the expedition. Cortés charged Pedro de Alvarado with gathering recruits from the inland estates of Cuba. The crew included officers that would become famous conquistadors, including Cristóbal de Olid, Gonzalo de Sandoval and Diego de Ordaz. Also aboard were Francisco de Montejo and Bernal Díaz del Castillo, veterans of the Grijalva expedition.

Alvarado once again commanded the &quot;San Sebastián&quot;, with 60 men under his orders. The fleet made its first landfall at Cozumel, and remained there for several days. Maya temples were cast down and a Christian cross was put up on one of them. From Cozumel, the fleet looped around the north of the Yucatán Peninsula and followed the coast to the Tabasco River. In Tabasco, the fleet anchored at Potonchán, a Chontal Maya town. The Maya prepared for battle but the Spanish horses and firearms quickly decided the outcome. From Potonchán, the fleet continued to San Juan de Ulua. The crew stayed only a short time before relocating to a promontory near Quiahuiztlan and Cempoala, a subject city of the Aztec Empire. Some of the Spaniards stayed near the coast when Cortés journeyed inland but Alvarado accompanied Cortés on the inland march. While marching toward Tenochtitlan, the expedition made a slight detour to travel through Tlaxcalteca lands. The Tlaxcalteca attacked the Spanish force numerous times but they were unable to rout the Spanish forces. After making an alliance with the Tlaxcalteca, the Spanish went on to conquer the Aztecs.
Alvarado commanded one of the eleven vessels in the fleet and also acted as Cortés&#x27; second in command during the expedition&#x27;s first stay in the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlán. Relations between the Spaniards and their hosts were uneasy, especially given Cortés&#x27; repeated insistence that the Aztecs desist from idol worship and human sacrifice; in order to ensure their own safety, the Spaniards took the Aztec king Moctezuma hostage. When Cortés returned to the Gulf coast to deal with the newly arrived hostile expedition of Pánfilo de Narváez, Alvarado remained in Tenochtitlan as commander of the Spanish enclave, with strict orders to make sure that Moctezuma not be permitted to escape.

During Cortés&#x27; absence, relations between the Spaniards and their hosts went from bad to worse, and Alvarado perpetrated the Massacre in the Great Temple, killing Aztec nobles and priests observing a religious festival. Alvarado claims he did so because he feared the Aztecs were plotting against him but there is no physical evidence to support this claim and the alleged warnings he received came from tortured captives that very likely would have said anything to make the torture stop. When Cortés returned to Tenochtitlan, he found the Spanish force under siege. After Moctezuma was killed in the attempt to negotiate with his own people, the Spaniards determined to escape by fighting their way across one of the causeways that led from the city across the lake and to the mainland. In a bloody nocturnal action of 10 July 1520, known as La Noche Triste, Alvarado led the rear-guard and was badly wounded. According to satirical verses by Gonzalo Ocampo, in reference to Alvarado crossing a causeway gap during the escape, Alvarado&#x27;s escape became known as &quot;Salto de Alvarado&quot; (&quot;Alvarado&#x27;s Leap&quot;).

Pedro then participated in the Siege of Tenochtitlan, commanding one of four forces under Cortés. Alvarado was wounded when Cuauhtemoc attacked all three Spanish camps on the feast day of St. John. Alvarado&#x27;s company was the first to make it to the Tlateloco marketplace, setting fire to the Aztec shrines. Cortés&#x27; and Sandoval&#x27;s companies joined him there after four more days of fighting.

==Conquest of Soconusco and Guatemala==
Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado to invade Guatemala with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and thousands of allied Mexican warriors. Pedro de Alvarado passed through Soconusco with a sizeable force in 1523, en route to conquer Guatemala. Alvarado&#x27;s army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; there were also a great many indigenous allies from Cholula, Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlaxcala, and Xochimilco.

Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. Alvarado&#x27;s letter to Hernán Cortés describing his passage through Soconusco is lost, and knowledge of events there come from the account of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who was not present, but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces.
Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the Pacific coast unopposed until they reached the Samalá River in western Guatemala. This region formed a part of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; kingdom, and a K&#x27;iche&#x27; army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river. Once across, the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K&#x27;iche&#x27;. On 8 February 1524 Alvarado&#x27;s army fought a battle at Xetulul, called Zapotitlán by his Mexican allies (modern San Francisco Zapotitlán). Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K&#x27;iche&#x27; archers, the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace.

Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K&#x27;iche&#x27; heartlands, crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango. On 12 February 1524 Alvarado&#x27;s Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K&#x27;iche&#x27; warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K&#x27;iche&#x27;, who had never before seen horses. The cavalry scattered the K&#x27;iche&#x27; and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju (modern Quetzaltenango) only to find it deserted.

Almost a week later, on 18 February 1524, a K&#x27;iche&#x27; army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and were comprehensively defeated; many K&#x27;iche&#x27; nobles were among the dead. This battle exhausted the K&#x27;iche&#x27; militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute, inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q&#x27;umarkaj, which was known as Tecpan Utatlan to the Nahuatl-speaking allies of the Spanish. Alvarado was deeply suspicious of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q&#x27;umarkaj with his army.
In March 1524 Pedro de Alvarado entered Q&#x27;umarkaj at the invitation of the remaining lords of the K&#x27;iche&#x27; after their catastrophic defeat, fearing that he was entering a trap. He encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside. Fearing the great number of K&#x27;iche&#x27; warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q&#x27;umarkaj, he invited the leading lords of the city, Oxib-Keh (the king) and Beleheb-Tzy (the king elect) to visit him in his camp.

As soon as they did so, he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp. The K&#x27;iche&#x27; warriors, seeing their lords taken prisoner, attacked the Spaniards&#x27; indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers. At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K&#x27;iche&#x27; lords burnt to death, and then proceeded to burn the entire city. After the destruction of Q&#x27;umarkaj and the execution of its rulers, Pedro de Alvarado sent messages to Iximche, capital of the Kaqchikel, proposing an alliance against the remaining K&#x27;iche&#x27; resistance.

===Kaqchikel alliance and conquest of the Tz&#x27;utujil===
On 14 April 1524, soon after the defeat of the K&#x27;iche&#x27;, the Spanish were invited into Iximche and were well received by the lords Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox. The Kaqchikel kings provided native soldiers to assist the conquistadors against continuing K&#x27;iche&#x27; resistance and to help with the defeat of the neighbouring Tz&#x27;utuhil kingdom. The Spanish only stayed briefly in Iximche before continuing through Atitlán, Escuintla and Cuscatlán. The Spanish returned to the Kaqchikel capital on 23 July 1524 and on 27 July, Pedro de Alvarado declared Iximche as the first capital of Guatemala, Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (&quot;St. James of the Knights of Guatemala&quot;).
The Kaqchikel appear to have entered into an alliance with the Spanish to defeat their enemies, the Tz&#x27;utujil, whose capital was Tecpan Atitlan. Pedro de Alvarado sent two Kaqchikel messengers to Tecpan Atitlan at the request of the Kaqchikel lords, both of whom were killed by the Tz&#x27;utujil. When news of the killing of the messengers reached the Spanish at Iximche, the conquistadors marched against the Tz&#x27;utujil with their Kaqchikel allies.

Pedro de Alvarado left Iximche just 5 days after he had arrived there, with 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day&#x27;s hard march, without encountering any opposition. Seeing the lack of resistance, Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore. Opposite a populated island the Spanish at last encountered hostile Tz&#x27;utujil warriors and charged among them, scattering and pursuing them to a narrow causeway across which the surviving Tz&#x27;utujil fled. The rest of Alvarado&#x27;s army soon reinforced his party and they successfully stormed the island. This battle took place on 18 April.

The following day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. Pedro de Alvarado camped in the centre of the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy. They managed to catch some locals and used them to send messages to the Tz&#x27;utujil lords, ordering them to submit to the king of Spain. The Tz&#x27;utujil leaders responded by surrendering to Pedro de Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after Pedro de Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz&#x27;utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain.

===Kaqchikel rebellion===
Pedro de Alvarado rapidly began to demand gold in tribute from the Kaqchikels, souring the friendship between the two peoples. He demanded that their kings deliver 1000 gold leaves, each worth 15 pesos. The Kaqchikel people abandoned their city and fled to the forests and hills on 28 August 1524. Ten days later the Spanish declared war on the Kaqchikel.

Two years later, on 9 February 1526, a group of sixteen Spanish deserters burnt the palace of the &quot;Ahpo Xahil&quot;, sacked the temples and kidnapped a priest, acts that the Kaqchikel blamed on Pedro de Alvarado. The Kaqchikel kept up resistance against the Spanish for a number of years. On 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops, the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja.

===Pacific lowlands of Guatemala===

On 8 May 1524, Pedro de Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain with an army numbering approximately 6000, where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque near Izcuintepeque on 9 May. Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead. The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day.

Pedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain. In the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation. Pedro de Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender, otherwise he would lay waste to their lands.

According to Alvarado&#x27;s letter to Cortés, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord. The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days. A few years later, in 1529, Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.
In Guazacapán, Pedro de Alvarado described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca. At this point Alvarado&#x27;s force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population.

Alvarado&#x27;s army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses.

This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Alvarado sent out Xinca messengers to make contact with the enemy but they failed to return. Messengers from the city of Pazaco, in the modern department of Jutiapa, offered peace to the conquistadors but when Alvarado arrived there the next day the inhabitants were preparing for war. Alvarado&#x27;s troops encountered a sizeable quantity of gathered warriors and quickly routed them through the city&#x27;s streets. From Pazaco, Alvarado crossed the Río Paz and entered what is now El Salvador.

==Cuzcatlan (El Salvador)==

Alvarado led the first effort by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of Cuzcatlan (in modern El Salvador), in June 1524. These efforts established many towns such as San José Acatempa in 1525 and Esquipulas in 1560. Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people known as the Pipil and their Mayan speaking neighbors. Despite Alvarado&#x27;s initial success in the Battle of Acajutla, the indigenous people of Cuzcatlán, who according to tradition were led by a warlord called Atlácatl, defeated the Spaniards and their auxiliaries, and forced them to withdraw to Guatemala.

Alvarado was wounded on his left thigh, remaining handicapped for the rest of his life. He abandoned the war and appointed his brother, Gonzalo de Alvarado, to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions were required (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) to bring the Pipil under Spanish control. In 1528 the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of San Salvador was established.

==Titles and first marriage==
On 18 December 1527, the king of Spain named Alvarado as governor of Guatemala; two days later he granted him the coveted military title of &quot;Adelantado&quot;. Alvarado&#x27;s close friendship with Cortés was broken in the same year; Alvarado had promised Cortés that he would marry Cecilia Vázquez, Cortes&#x27; cousin. Alvarado broke his promise and instead married Francisca de la Cueva. Technically, this was not his first marriage as he married an indigenous woman, daughter to Xicotencatl the Elder, who was referred to as Dona Luisa by Spanish speakers and Tlecuiluatzin by Nahuatl speakers.

Francisca de la Cueva was well connected at the royal court, being the niece of Francisco de los Cobos, the king&#x27;s secretary, and a member of the powerful noble house of Albuquerque. This marriage gave Alvarado extra leverage at court and was far more useful to his long term interests; Alvarado thereafter maintained a friendship with Francisco de los Cobos that allowed him access to the king&#x27;s favour. In 1528, by coincidence both Alvarado and Cortés were in Seville at the same time, but Cortés ignored him.

Francisca de la Cueva died shortly after their arrival in America. Alvarado remained governor of Guatemala until his death. He was made Knight of Santiago in 1527.

==Peru==
By 1532, Alvarado&#x27;s friendship with Hernán Cortés had soured, and he no longer trusted him. At this time Alvarado requested permission from the king for an expedition south along the Pacific coast, to conquer any lands there that had not already been claimed for the Crown, and specifically rejected that Cortés should accompany him. In 1534, Alvarado heard tales of the riches of Peru, headed south to the Andes and attempted to bring the province of Quito under his rule. When he arrived, he found the land already held by Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s lieutenant Sebastián de Belalcázar. The two forces of Conquistadors almost came to battle; however, Alvarado bartered to Pizarro&#x27;s group most of his ships, horses, and ammunition, plus most of his men, for a comparatively modest sum of money, and returned to Guatemala.

==Governor of Honduras==

In 1532, Alvarado received a Royal Cedula naming him Governor of the Province of Honduras. At that time, Honduras consisted of a single settlement of Spaniards in Trujillo, but he declined to act on it. In 1533 or 1534 he began to send his own work gangs of enslaved Africans and Native Americans into the parts of Honduras adjacent to Guatemala to work the placer gold deposits.

In 1536, ostensibly in response to a letter asking for aid from Andrés de Cereceda, then acting Governor of the Province of Honduras, Alvarado and his army of Indian allies arrived in Honduras, just as the Spanish colonists were preparing to abandon the country and go look for gold in Peru. In June, 1536, Alvarado engaged the indigenous resistance led by Cicumba in the lower Ulua river valley, and won. He divided up the Indian labor in &quot;repartimiento&quot; grants to his soldiers and some of the colonists, and returned to Guatemala.

During a visit to Spain, in 1537, Alvarado had the governorship of Honduras reconfirmed in addition to that of Guatemala for the next seven years. His governorship of Honduras was not uncontested. Francisco de Montejo had a rival claim, and was installed by the Spanish king as Governor of Honduras in 1540. Ten years after being widowed, Alvarado married one of his first wife&#x27;s sisters, Beatriz de la Cueva, who outlived him.

After the death of Alvarado, de la Cueva maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times. She drowned a few days after taking office in the destruction of the capital city Ciudad Vieja by a sudden mudflow from the Volcán de Agua in 1541.

==Death in the Mixtón War, 1541==
Alvarado developed a plan to outfit an armada that would sail from the western coast of Mexico to China and the Spice Islands. At great cost, he assembled and equipped 13 ships and approximately 550 soldiers for the expedition. The fleet was about to set sail in 1541 when Alvarado received a letter from Cristóbal de Oñate, pleading for help against hostile Indians who were besieging him at Nochistlán.

The siege was part of a major revolt by the Mixtón natives of the Nueva Galicia region of Mexico. Alvarado gathered his troops and went to help Oñate. In a freak accident, he was crushed by a horse that was spooked and ran amok. Alvarado lay in agony before eventually dying a few days later, on July 4, 1541, and was buried in the church at Tiripetío, a village between Pátzcuaro and Morelia (in present-day Michoacán).

Four decades after Alvarado&#x27;s death, his mestiza daughter Leonor de Alvarado Xicoténcatl paid to transport his remains to Guatemala for reburial in the cathedral of the city of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, now Antigua Guatemala.

==Family==
After the death of her husband, Beatriz de la Cueva maneuvered her own election and succeeded him as governor of Guatemala, becoming the only woman to govern a major political division of the Americas in Spanish colonial times.

Alvarado had no children from either of his legal marriages. His life companion was his concubine Luisa de Tlaxcala (also called Xicoténcatl or Tecubalsi, her original names after Catholic baptism). She was a Nahua noblewoman, daughter of the Tlaxcallan King Xicotencatl the Elder. Luisa was given by her father in 1519 to Hernán Cortés as a proof of respect and friendship. In turn Cortés gave her &quot;in guard&quot; to Pedro de Alvarado, who quickly and unremarkably became her lover. Luisa followed Alvarado in his pursuit of conquests beyond central Mexico. Despite never being his legitimate wife, Luisa de Tlaxcala had numerous possessions and was respected as a Doña, both for her relationship with Alvarado and for her noble origin. She died in 1535 and was buried at the Guatemala Cathedral.

With Luisa de Tlaxcala Pedro de Alvarado had three children: 
* Leonor de Alvarado y Xicotenga Tecubalsi, born in the newly founded Spanish city of Santiago de los Caballeros, who married Pedro de Portocarrero, a conqueror trusted by his father-in-law, whom he accompanied during the conquests of Mexico and Guatemala. Portocarrero participated in numerous battles against the Indians.
: Leonor married a second time, to Francisco de la Cueva y Guzman. The Alvarado fortune remained with their descendants for generations to come, in the family of Villacreces de la Cueva y Guzmán, governors of this part of Guatemala.
* Pedro de Alvarado, named for his father, who disappeared at sea when traveling to Spain
* Diego de Alvarardo, &quot;El Mestizo&quot;, who died in 1554 in the civil wars of Peru.

By other women, in more casual relationships, he had two other children: 
* Gómez de Alvarado, without further notice
* Ana (Anita) de Alvarado

<doc id="74836" wikidata="Q2143661" url="?curid=74836" title="Corrective lens">
<text>A corrective lens is a transmissive optical device that is worn on the eye to improve visual perception. The most common use is to treat refractive errors: myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Glasses or &quot;spectacles&quot; are worn on the face a short distance in front of the eye. Contact lenses are worn directly on the surface of the eye. Intraocular lenses are surgically implanted most commonly after cataract removal but can be used for purely refractive purposes. 

==Prescription of corrective lenses==

Corrective lenses are typically prescribed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist. The prescription consists of all the specifications necessary to make the lens. Prescriptions typically include the power specifications of each lens (for each eye). Strengths are generally prescribed in quarter-diopter steps (0.25 D), because most people cannot generally distinguish between smaller increments (e.g., eighth-diopter steps / 0.125 D). The use of improper corrective lenses may not be helpful and can even exacerbate binocular vision disorders. Eyecare professionals (optometrists and ophthalmologists) are trained to determine the specific corrective lenses that will provide the clearest, most comfortable, and most efficient vision, avoiding double vision and maximizing binocularity.

===Over-the-counter correction===
Ready-made single-vision reading glasses go by many names, including over-the-counter glasses, ready readers, cheaters, magnifiers, non-prescription readers, or generic readers. They are designed to lessen the focusing burden of near work, such as reading. They are typically sold in retail locations such as pharmacies and grocery stores but are also available in book stores and clothing retailers. They are available in common reading prescriptions with strengths ranging from +0.75 to +3.50 diopters. While these &quot;magnifiers&quot; do indeed make the image of the viewed object bigger, their main advantage comes from focusing the image, not magnification.

These glasses are not tailored to a person&#x27;s individual needs. A difference in refractive error between the eyes or the presence of astigmatism will not be accounted for. People with little to no need for correction in the distance may find off-the-shelf glasses work quite well for seeing better during near vision tasks. But if the person has a significant need for distance correction, it is less likely that the over-the-counter glasses will be perfectly effective. Although such glasses are generally considered safe, an individual prescription, as determined by an ophthalmologist or optometrist and made by a qualified optician, usually results in better visual correction and fewer headaches and visual discomfort. Another criticism of over-the-counter glasses is that they may alleviate symptoms, causing a person to forgo the other benefits of routine vision exams, such as early diagnosis of chronic disease.

===Self-selected corrective lenses===
Although lenses are normally prescribed by optometrists or ophthalmologists, there is evidence from developing countries that allowing people to select lenses for themselves produces good results in the majority of cases and is less than a tenth of the cost of prescription lenses.

==Lens types==

===Single vision===

Single vision lenses correct for only one distance. If they correct for far distance, the person must accommodate to see up close. If the person cannot accommodate, they may need a separate correction for near distances, or else use a multifocal lens (see below).

Reading glasses are single vision lenses designed for near work and include over the counter glasses. They come in two main styles: full frames, in which the entire lens is made in the reading prescription, and half-eyes, style glasses that sit lower down on the nose. Full frame readers must be removed to see distance clearly, while the distance can be clearly viewed over the top of half-eye readers.

===Bifocal===

A bifocal is a lens with two sections, separated by a line (see image to the right). Generally, the upper part of the lens is used for distance vision, while the lower segment is used for near vision. The area of the lens that caters to near vision is called the add segment. There are many different shapes, sizes, and positions for the add segment, such as rounded bifocals and D segment bifocals, that are selected for functional differences as well as the visual demands of the patient. Bifocals allow people with presbyopia to see clearly at distance and near without having to remove the glasses, which would be required with single vision correction.

===Trifocal===
Trifocal lenses are similar to bifocals, except that the two focal areas are separated by a third area (with intermediate focus correction) in the middle. This segment corrects the wearer&#x27;s vision for intermediate distances roughly at arms&#x27; length, &quot;e.g.&quot; computer distance. This lens type has two segment lines, dividing the three different correcting segments.

===Progressive===
Progressive addition or varifocal lenses provide a smooth transition from distance correction to near correction, eliminating segment lines and allowing clear vision at all distances, including intermediate (roughly arms&#x27; length). The lack of any abrupt change in power and the uniform appearance of the lens gives rise to the name &quot;no-line bifocal&quot;.

===Multifocal===
Multifocal contact lenses (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are comparable to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing through the center of the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).

===Adjustable focus===
The power or focal length of adjustable or variable focus can be changed to suit the needs of the wearer. A typical application of such a lens is to refocus the correction allowing clear vision at any distance. Unlike with bifocals, near-vision correction is achieved over the entire field of view, in any direction. Switching between distance and near vision is accomplished by re-adjusting the lens, instead of by tilting and/or rotating the head. The need for constant adjustment when the person&#x27;s attention switches to an object at a different distance is a design challenge of such a lens. Manual adjustment is more cumbersome than bifocals or similar lenses. Automated systems require electronic systems, power supplies, and sensors that increase the cost, size, and weight of the correction.

===Plano===
A corrective lens with a power of zero is called a plano lens. These lenses are used when one or both eyes do not require correction of a refractive error. Some people with good natural eyesight like to wear eyeglasses as a style accessory, or want to change the appearance of their eyes using novelty contact lenses.

==Lens optical profile==

Although corrective lenses can be produced in many different profiles, the most common is ophthalmic or convex-concave. In an ophthalmic lens, both the front and back surfaces have a positive radius, resulting in a positive/convergent front surface and a negative/divergent back surface. The difference in curvature between the front and rear surface leads to the corrective power of the lens. In hyperopia a convergent lens is needed; therefore, the convergent front surface overpowers the divergent back surface. For myopia the opposite is true: the divergent back surface is greater in magnitude than the convergent front surface. To correct for presbyopia, the lens, or section of the lens, must be more convergent or less divergent than the person&#x27;s distance lens.
The base curve (usually determined from the profile of the front surface of an ophthalmic lens) can be changed to result in the best optic and cosmetic characteristics across the entire surface of the lens. Optometrists may choose to specify a particular base curve when prescribing a corrective lens for either of these reasons. A multitude of mathematical formulas and professional clinical experience has allowed optometrists and lens designers to determine standard base curves that are ideal for most people. As a result, the front surface curve is more standardized and the characteristics that generate a person&#x27;s unique prescription are typically derived from the geometry of the back surface of the lens.

===Bifocals and trifocals===
Bifocals and trifocals result in a more complex lens profile, compounding multiple surfaces. The main lens is composed of a typical ophthalmic lens. Thus the base curve defines the front surface of the main part of the lens while the back surface geometry is changed to achieve the desired distance power. The &quot;bifocal&quot; is a third spherical segment, called an &quot;add segment&quot;, found on the front surface of the lens. Steeper and more convergent than the base curve, the add segment combines with the back surface to deliver the person&#x27;s near correction. Early manufacturing techniques fused a separate lens to the front surface, but modern processes cut all the geometry into a single piece of lens material. There are many locations, profiles, and sizes of add segments typically referred to as segment type. Some &quot;seg type&quot; examples include Flat top, Kryptok, Orthogon, Tillyer Executive, and Ultex A. Trifocals contain two add segments to achieve a lens that corrects the person&#x27;s vision for three distinct distances.

The optical center of the add segment may be placed on the lens surface or may hang off into an empty space near the lens surface. Although the surface profile of a bifocal segment is spherical, it is often trimmed to have straight edges so that it is contained within a small region of the overall lens surface.

===Progressive lens===
The progressive addition lens (PAL, also commonly called a no-line or varifocal lens) eliminates the line in bi/tri-focals and is very complex in its profile. PALs are a continuously variable parametric surface that begins using one spherical surface base curve and ends at another, with the radius of curvature continuously varying as the transition is made from one surface to the other. This shift in curvature results in different powers being delivered from different locations on the lens.
== Vertex distance ==
Vertex distance is the space between the front of the eye and the back surface of the lens. In glasses with powers beyond ±4.00D, the vertex distance can affect the effective power of the glasses. A shorter vertex distance can expand the field of view, but if the vertex distance is too small, the eyelashes will come into contact with the back of the lens, smudging the lens and causing annoyance for the wearer. A skilled frame stylist will help the wearer select a good balance of fashionable frame size with good vertex distance to achieve ideal aesthetics and field of view. The average vertex distance in a pair of glasses is 12-14mm. A contact lens is placed directly on the eye and thus has a vertex distance of zero.

== Refractive index ==

In the UK and the US, the refractive index is generally specified concerning the yellow He-d Fraunhofer line, commonly abbreviated as nd. Lens materials are classified by their refractive index, as follows:
* Normal index: 1.48 ≤ &lt; 1.54
* Mid-index: 1.54 ≤ &lt; 1.60
* High-index: 1.60 ≤ &lt; 1.74
* Very high index: 1.76 ≤ 

This is a general classification. Often for marketing purposes, materials with values that are at or above 1.60 can be referred to as &quot;high-index&quot;. Likewise, Trivex and other borderline normal / mid-index materials may be referred to as mid-index.

=== Advantages of higher indices ===
* Thinner, sometimes lighter lenses (See below).
* Improved UV protection over CR-39 and glass lenses.

=== Disadvantages of increased indices ===
* Lower Abbe number, meaning, amongst other things, increased chromatic aberration.
* Poorer light transmission and increased backside and inner-surface reflections (see Fresnel reflection equation), increasing the importance of anti-reflective coating.
* Manufacturing defects have more impact on optical quality.
* Theoretically, off-axis optical quality degrades (oblique astigmatic error). In practice this degradation should not be perceptible – current frame styles are much smaller than they would have to be for these aberrations to be noticeable to the patient, the aberration occurring some distance away from the optical centre of the lens (off-axis).

== Optical quality ==

=== Abbe number ===


Of all of the properties of particular lens material, the one that most closely relates to its optical performance is its dispersion, which is specified by the Abbe number. Higher Abbe numbers mean a better lens material, and lower Abbe numbers result in the presence of chromatic aberration (i.e., color fringes above/below or to the left/right of a high contrast object), especially in larger lens sizes and stronger prescriptions (beyond ±4.00D). Generally, lower Abbe numbers are a property of mid and higher index lenses that cannot be avoided, regardless of the material used. The Abbe number for a material at a particular refractive index formulation is usually specified as its Abbe value.

In practice, an Abbe number change from 30 to 32 will not have a practically noticeable benefit, but a change from 30 to 47 could be beneficial for users with strong prescriptions that move their eyes and look &quot;off-axis&quot; of the optical center of the lens. Some users do not sense color fringing directly but will just describe &quot;off-axis blurriness&quot;.
Abbe values even as high as that of produce chromatic aberrations which can be perceptible to a user in lenses larger than 40 mm in diameter and especially in strengths that are in excess of ±4 D. At ±8 D even glass produces chromatic aberration that can be noticed by a user. Chromatic aberration is independent of the lens being of spherical, aspheric, or atoric design.

The eye&#x27;s Abbe number is independent of the importance of the corrective lens&#x27;s Abbe, since the human eye:
* Moves to keep the visual axis close to its achromatic axis, which is completely free of dispersion (i.e., to see the dispersion one would have to concentrate on points in the periphery of vision, where visual clarity is quite poor)
* Is very insensitive, especially to color, in the periphery (i.e., at retinal points distant from the achromatic axis and thus not falling on the fovea, where the cone cells responsible for color vision are concentrated. &quot;See: Anatomy and Physiology of the Retina.&quot;)
In contrast, the eye moves to look through various parts of a corrective lens as it shifts its gaze, some of which can be as much as several centimeters off of the optical center. Thus, despite the eye&#x27;s dispersive properties, the corrective lens&#x27;s dispersion cannot be dismissed. People who are sensitive to the effects of chromatic aberrations, or who have stronger prescriptions, or who often look off the lens&#x27;s optical center, or who prefer larger corrective lens sizes may be impacted by chromatic aberration. To minimize chromatic aberration:
* Try to use the smallest vertical lens size that is comfortable. Generally, chromatic aberrations are more noticeable as the pupil moves vertically below the optical center of the lens (e.g., reading or looking at the ground while standing or walking). Keep in mind that a smaller vertical lens size will result in a greater amount of vertical head movement, especially while performing activities that involve short and intermediate distance viewing, which could lead to an increase in neck strain, especially in occupations involving a large vertical field of view.
* Restrict the choice of lens material to the highest Abbe value at an acceptable thickness. The oldest most basic commonly used lens materials also happen to have the best optical characteristics at the expense of corrective lens thickness (i.e., cosmetics). Newer materials have focused on improved cosmetics and increased impact safety, at the expense of optical quality. Lenses sold in the US must pass the Food and Drug Administration ball-drop impact test, and depending on needed index these seem to currently have &quot;best in class&quot; Abbe vs Index Glass (2× weight of plastics) or CR-39 (2 mm vs. 1.5 mm thickness typical on newer materials) 58 @ 1.5, Sola Spectralite (47 @ 1.53), Sola Finalite (43 @ 1.6), and Hoya Eyry (36 @ 1.7). For impact resistance safety glass is offered at a variety of indexes at high Abbe number, but is still 2x the weight of plastics. Polycarbonate is very dispersive but has excellent shatter resistance. Trivex is also heavily marketed as an impact-resistant alternative to Polycarbonate, for individuals who do not need polycarbonate&#x27;s index. Trivex is also one of the lightest materials available.
* Use contact lenses in place of or as well as eyeglasses. A contact lens rests directly on the surface of the cornea and moves in sync with all eye movements; consequently, a contact lens is always almost perfectly aligned on center with the pupil, and there is never any significant off-axis misalignment between the pupil and the optical center of the lens.

=== Power error ===
Power error is the change in the optical power of a lens as the eye looks through various points on the area of the lens. Generally, it is least present at the optic center and gets progressively worse as one looks towards the edges of the lens. The actual amount of power error is highly dependent on the strength of the prescription as well as whether a best spherical form of lens or an optically optimal aspherical form was used in the manufacture of the lens. Generally, the best spherical form lenses attempt to keep the ocular curve between four and seven diopters.

=== Lens induced oblique astigmatism ===

As the eye shifts its gaze from looking through the optical center of the corrective lens, the lens-induced astigmatism value increases. In a spherical lens, especially one with a strong correction whose base curve is not in the best spherical form, such increases can significantly impact the clarity of vision in the periphery.

=== Minimizing power error and lens induced astigmatism ===
As corrective power increases, even optimally designed lenses will have distortion that can be noticed by a user. This particularly affects individuals that use the off-axis areas of their lenses for visually demanding tasks. For individuals sensitive to lens errors, the best way to eliminate lens induced aberrations is to use contact lenses. Contacts eliminate all these aberrations since the lens then moves with the eye.

Barring contacts, a good lens designer does not have many parameters that can be traded off to improve vision. The index has little effect on error. Note that, although chromatic aberration is often perceived as &quot;blurry vision&quot; in the lens periphery and gives the impression of power error, this is actually due to color shifting. Chromatic aberration can be improved by using a material with improved ABBE. The best way to combat lens induced power error is to limit the choice of corrective lens to one that is in the best spherical form. A lens designer determines the best-form spherical curve using the Oswalt curve on the Tscherning ellipse. This design gives the best achievable optical quality and least sensitivity to lens fitting. A flatter base-curve is sometimes selected for cosmetic reasons. Aspheric or atoric design can reduce errors induced by using a suboptimal flatter base-curve. They cannot surpass the optical quality of a spherical best-form lens but can reduce the error induced by using a flatter-than-optimal base curve. The improvement due to flattening is most evident for strong farsighted lenses. High myopes (-6D) may see a slight cosmetic benefit with larger lenses. Mild prescriptions will have no perceptible benefit (-2D). Even at high prescriptions, some high myope prescriptions with small lenses may not see any difference, since some aspheric lenses have a spherically designed center area for improved vision and fit.

In practice, labs tend to produce pre-finished and finished lenses in groups of narrow power ranges to reduce inventory. Lens powers that fall into the range of the prescriptions of each group share a constant base curve. For example, corrections from -4.00D to -4.50D may be grouped and forced to share the same base curve characteristics, but the spherical form is only best for a -4.25D prescription. In this case, the error will be imperceptible to the human eye. However, some manufacturers may further cost-reduce inventory and group over a larger range which will result in perceptible error for some users in the range who also use the off-axis area of their lens. Additionally, some manufacturers may verge toward a slightly flatter curve. Although if only a slight bias toward plano is introduced it may be negligible cosmetically and optically. These optical degradations due to base-curve grouping also apply to aspherics since their shapes are intentionally flattened and then asphericized to minimize error for the average base curve in the grouping.
== Cosmetics and weight ==

=== Reducing lens thickness ===

The greatest cosmetic improvement on lens thickness (and weight) benefits from choosing a frame that holds physically small lenses. The smallest of the popular adult lens sizes available in retail outlets is about across. There are a few adult sizes of , and although they are quite rare, can reduce lens weight to about half of the 50 mm versions. The curves on the front and back of a lens are ideally formed with the specific radius of a sphere. This radius is set by the lens designer based on the prescription and cosmetic consideration. Selecting a smaller lens will mean less of this sphere surface is represented by the lens surface, meaning the lens will have a thinner edge (myopia) or center (hyperopia). A thinner edge reduces light entering into the edge, reducing an additional source of internal reflections.

Extremely thick lenses for myopia can be beveled to reduce flaring out of the very thick edge. Thick myopic lenses are not usually mounted in wire frames, because the thin wire contrasts against the thick lens, to make its thickness much more obvious to others.

The index can improve the lens thinness, but at a point, no more improvement will be realized. For example, if an index and lens size is selected with center to edge thickness difference of 1 mm then changing index can only improve thickness by a fraction of this. This is also true with aspheric design lenses.

The lens&#x27;s minimum thickness can also be varied. The FDA ball drop test (5/8&quot; 0.56-ounce steel ball dropped from 50 inches) effectively sets the minimum thickness of materials. Glass or CR-39 requires 2.0 mm, but some newer materials only require 1.5 mm or even 1.0 mm minimum thickness.

=== Weight ===
Material density typically increases as lens thickness is reduced by increasing index. There is also a minimum lens thickness required to support the lens shape. These factors result in a thinner lens which is not lighter than the original. There are lens materials with lower density at higher index which can result in a truly lighter lens. These materials can be found in a material property table. Reducing frame lens size will give the most noticeable improvement in weight for a given material. Ways to reduce the weight and thickness of corrective lenses, in approximate order of importance are these:
* Choose glasses frames with small lenses; that is to say so that the longest measurement across the lens at any angle is as short as possible. This gives the greatest advantage of all.
* Choose a frame that allows the pupil to occupy the exact middle point of the lens.
* Choose a lens as near round as possible. These are less commonly found than other shapes.
* Choose as high a refractive index for the lens material as cost permits.

It is not always possible to follow the above points, because of the rarity of such frames, and the need for a more pleasing appearance. However, these are the main factors to consider if ever it should become necessary and possible to do so.

=== Facial distortion and social stigma ===
Eyeglasses for a high-diopter nearsighted or farsighted person cause a visible distortion of their face as seen by other people, in the apparent size of the eyes and facial features visible through the eyeglasses.
* For extreme nearsightedness, the eyes appear small and sunken into the face, and the sides of the skull can be visible through the lens. This gives the wearer the appearance of having a very large or fat head in contrast with their eyes.
* For extreme farsightedness the eyes appear very large on the face, making the wearer&#x27;s head seem too small.

Either situation can result in social stigma due to some facial distortions. This can result in the low self-esteem of the eyeglass wearer and lead to difficulty in making friends and developing relationships.

People with very high-power corrective lenses can benefit socially from contact lenses because these distortions are minimized and their facial appearance to others is normal. Aspheric/atoric eyeglass design can also reduce minification and magnification of the eye for observers at some angles.
== Lens materials ==
=== Optical crown glass ===
* Refractive index (): 1.52288
* Abbe number (): 58.5
* Density: 2.56 g/cm³ (the heaviest corrective lens material in common use, today)
* UV cutoff: 320 nm

Glass lenses have become less common owing to the danger of shattering and their relatively high weight compared to CR-39 plastic lenses. They still remain in use for specialised circumstances, for example in extremely high prescriptions (currently, glass lenses can be manufactured up to a refractive index of 1.9) and in certain occupations where the hard surface of glass offers more protection from sparks or shards of material. If the highest Abbe number is desired, the only choices for common lens optical material are optical crown glass and CR-39.

Higher-quality optical-grade glass materials exist (e.g. Borosilicate crown glasses such as BK7 which is commonly used in telescopes and binoculars, and fluorite crown glasses such as the best optical quality low dispersion glass currently in production, N-FK58 made by the German company Schott with the following characteristics and are commonly used in high-end camera lenses).

One must bear in mind that the human eye itself has an Abbe number so the expensive, high-end optical glass types mentioned above have little value for central vision; however, the wearer&#x27;s view through the side of a glass lens is not comparable to central vision through the eye: Low dispersion glass definitely makes optically superior corrective lenses since it greatly reduces color-fringing of edge-wise viewed contrasty objects, compared to all available plastics. But glass lenses are much heavier, and making them requires specialized glass grinding equipment no longer common in ordinary prescription lens labs: At present, one is often hard-pressed to find an optical laboratory that has the machinery needed shape custom glass lenses.

A further complication for seeking lenses made of better, even-lower dispersion glass, is that the specialty glass is often expensive. Also, many exotic glass types, with Abbe number contain oxides of heavy metals such as arsenic or lanthanum, some of which are toxic. The need for special venting to protect technicians from exposure to powdered toxic glass further limits the number of optical labs that can safely grind super-low dispersion / large Abbe number glass.

Abbe numbers () in excess of Crown Glass and CR-39 are mainly warranted only for unusual special uses, such as
* extreme positive or negative diopter prescriptions
* very large size lenses, such as might cover a good portion of the face
* low wearer tolerance of color fringing
* occupations that involve work with very high contrast elements (e.g. reading dark print on white paper under bright light)
* construction work that requires viewing contrasting dark building elements against a cloudy white sky
* workplace with bright recessed can lighting or other darkened room lighting, concentrated on a small areas, shining on bright reflective surfaces (e.g. display counters at jeweler stores).

=== Optical plastics ===
Plastic lenses are currently the most commonly prescribed lens, owing to their relative safety, low cost, ease of production, and high optical quality. The main drawbacks of many types of plastic lenses are the ease by which a lens can be scratched, and the limitations and costs of producing higher-index lenses.

==== CR-39 ====
* Refractive index (): 1.498 (standard)
* Abbe number (): 59.3
* Density: 1.31 g/cm³
* UV cutoff: 355 nm

CR-39 lenses are inherently scratch resistant.

==== Trivex ====
* Refractive index (): 1.532
* Abbe number (): 43–45 (depending on licensing manufacturer)
* Density: 1.1 g/cm³ (the lightest corrective lens material in common use)
* UV cutoff: 394 nm

Trivex was invented by Edwin C. Slagel and patented in September 1998.

Trivex was developed in 2001 by PPG Industries for the military as transparent armor. With Hoya Corporation and Younger Optics, PPG announced the availability of Trivex for the optical industry in 2001. Trivex is a urethane-based pre-polymer. PPG named the material Trivex because of its three main performance properties: Superior optics, ultra lightweight, and extreme strength.

Trivex is a relative newcomer that possesses the UV-blocking properties and shatter resistance of polycarbonate while at the same time offering far superior optical quality (i.e., higher Abbe number) and a slightly lower density. Its lower refractive index of vs. polycarbonate&#x27;s 1.586 may result in slightly thicker lenses depending upon the prescription. Along with polycarbonate and the various high-index plastics, Trivex is a lab favorite for use in rimless frames, owing to the ease with which it can be drilled and its resistance to cracking around the drill holes. One other advantage that Trivex has over polycarbonate is that it can be tinted.

==== Polycarbonate ====
* Refractive index (): 1.586
* Abbe number (): 30
* Density: 1.2 g/cm³
* UV cutoff: 385 nm

Polycarbonate is lighter weight than normal plastic. It blocks UV rays, is shatter resistant, and is used in sports glasses and glasses for children and teenagers. Because polycarbonate is soft and will scratch easily, a scratch-resistant coating is typically applied after shaping and polishing the lens. Standard polycarbonate with an Abbe number of 30 is one of the worst materials optically if chromatic aberration intolerance is of concern. Along with Trivex and the high-index plastics, polycarbonate is an excellent choice for rimless eyeglasses. Similar to the high-index plastics, polycarbonate has a very low Abbe number, which may be bothersome to individuals sensitive to chromatic aberrations.

==== High-index plastics (thiourethanes) ====
* Refractive index (): 1.600–1.740
* Abbe number (): 42–32 (higher indexes generally result in lower Abbe numbers)
* Density: 1.3–1.5 (g/cm³)
* UV cutoff: 380–400 nm

High-index plastics allow for thinner lenses. The lenses may not be lighter, however, due to the increase in density vs. mid- and normal index materials. A disadvantage is that high-index plastic lenses have a much higher level of chromatic aberrations, which can be seen from their lower Abbe numbers. Aside from the thinness of the lens, another advantage of high-index plastics is their strength and shatter resistance, although not as shatter resistant as polycarbonate. This makes them particularly suitable for rimless eyeglasses.

These high-refractive-index plastics are typically thiourethanes, with the sulfur atoms in the polymer being responsible for the high refractive index. The sulfur content can be up to 60 percent by weight for a material with index 

=== Ophthalmic material property tables ===



Indices of refraction for a range of materials can be found in the list of refractive indices.

== Lens coatings ==
=== Anti-reflective ===
Anti-reflective coatings help to make the eye behind the lens more visible. They also help lessen back reflections of the white of the eye as well as bright objects behind the eyeglasses wearer (e.g. windows, lamps). Such a reduction of back reflections increases the apparent contrast of surroundings. At night, anti-reflective coatings help to reduce headlight glare from oncoming cars, street lamps, and heavily lit or neon signs.

One problem with anti-reflective coatings is that historically they have been very easy to scratch. Newer coatings try to address this problem by combining scratch resistance with the anti-reflective coating. They also offer a measure of dirt and smudge resistance, due to their hydrophobic qualities. 

=== Ultraviolet protection ===
A UV coating is used to reduce the transmission of light in the ultraviolet spectrum. UV-B radiation increases the likelihood of cataracts, while long-term exposure to UV-A radiation can damage the retina. DNA damage from UV light is cumulative and irreversible. Some materials such as Trivex and Polycarbonate, naturally block most UV light; they have UV-cutoff wavelengths just outside the visible range and do not benefit from the application of a UV coating. Many modern anti-reflective coatings also block UV.

=== Scratch resistance ===
Resists damage to lens surfaces from minor scratches.

==Confusing corrective lens industry terminology==

===Spheric vs. aspheric, atoric, etc.===
Lens manufacturers claim that aspheric lenses improve vision over traditional spheric lenses. This statement could be misleading to individuals who do not know that the lenses are being implicitly compared to &quot;a spheric flattened away from best-form for cosmetic reasons&quot;. This qualification is necessary since best-form spherics are always better than aspherics for an ophthalmic lens application. Aspherics are only used for corrective lenses when, in order to achieve a flatter lens for cosmetic reasons, the lens design deviates from the best-form sphere; this results in degradation of the visual correction, degradation which can, in some part, be compensated for by an aspheric design. The same is true for atoric and bi-aspheric.

While it is true that aspheric lenses are used in cameras and binoculars, it would be wrong to assume that this means aspherics/atorics result in better optics for eyewear. Cameras and telescopes use multiple lens elements and have different design criteria. Spectacles are made of only one ophthalmic lens, and the best-form spheric lens has been shown to give the best vision. In cases where best-form is not used, such as cosmetic flattening, thinning or wrap-around sunglasses, an aspheric design can reduce the amount of induced optical distortions.

It is worth noting that aspheric lenses are a broad category. A lens is made of two curved surfaces, and an aspheric lens is a lens where one or both of those surfaces is not spherical. Further research and development is being conducted to determine whether the mathematical and theoretical benefits of aspheric lenses can be implemented in practice in a way that results in better vision correction.

===Optical aberrations of the eye lens vs. corrective lens===
Optical terms are used to describe errors in the eye&#x27;s lens and the corrective lens. This can cause confusion since &quot;astigmatism&quot; or &quot;ABBE&quot; has a drastically different impact on vision depending on which lens has the error.

===Astigmatism disambiguation===
Astigmatism of the eye: Patients who are prescribed a sphere and a cylinder prescription have astigmatism of the eye, and can be given a toric lens to correct it.

Astigmatism of the corrective lens: This phenomenon is called lens-induced oblique astigmatism error (OAE) or power error and is induced when the eye looks through the ophthalmic lens at a point oblique to the optical center (OC). This may become especially evident beyond -6D.

Example: A patient with astigmatism (or no astigmatism) of the eye and a high prescription may notice astigmatism of the lens (OAE) when looking through the corner of their glasses.

===Aspheric and atoric disambiguation===
In ophthalmic terminology, &quot;aspheric lens&quot; specifically refers to a subclass of aspheric lens. Designs that feature &quot;flatter&quot; curves trade optical quality for cosmetic appearance. By using a non-spheric lens shape, an aspheric lens attempts to correct the error induced by flattening the lens. Typically, the design focuses on reducing the error (OAE) across the horizontal and vertical lens axis edges. This is of primary benefit to farsighted individuals, whose lenses have a thick center.

An atoric lens design refers to a lens with a more complex aspheric lens design. An atoric lens design can address errors over more corners of the lens, not just the horizontal and vertical axis.

A toric lens is designed to compensate for the astigmatism of a patient&#x27;s eye. Even though this lens is technically &quot;aspheric&quot;, the terms &quot;aspheric&quot; and &quot;atoric&quot; are reserved for lenses which correct errors induced by cosmetic lens flattening.

== U.S. legal requirements for prescriptions ==
In the United States, laws at the federal and state level govern the provision and effective dates of prescriptions for contact lenses and eyeglasses. Federal law requires that eyeglass and contact lens prescriptions be given to every consumer and that the prescriptions be for a minimum of one year. (FTC Section 456.2 &quot;Separation of examination and dispensing&quot; was reviewed in 2004: FTC 2004 review of section 456.2).

State laws vary. For example, California law also requires prescriptions to be provided to clients whether demanded or not. Eyeglass prescriptions must be for a minimum of two years, and contact prescriptions must be for a minimum of one year.

<text>Bideford ( ) is a historic port town on the estuary of the River Torridge in north Devon, South West England. It is the main town of the Torridge local government district.

==Toponymy==
In ancient records Bideford is recorded as &quot;Bedeford&quot;, &quot;Byddyfrod&quot;, &quot;Bedyford&quot;, &quot;Bydeford&quot;, &quot;Bytheford&quot; and &quot;Biddeford&quot;. The etymology of the name means &quot;by the ford,&quot; and records show that, before there was a bridge, there was a ford at Bideford where River Torridge is estuarine; and at low tide, it is possible (but not advisable) to cross the river by wading on foot.

==History==
===Early history===
Hubba the Dane was said to have attacked Devon in the area around Bideford near Northam or near Kenwith Castle, and was repelled either by Alfred the Great (849–899) or by the Saxon Earl of Devon.

The manor of Bideford was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as held at some time in chief from William the Conqueror by the great Saxon nobleman Brictric, but later held by the king&#x27;s wife Matilda of Flanders (c. 1031–1083). There were then 30 villagers, 8 smallholders and 14 slaves in Bideford, within the ancient hundred of Merton in Devon. According to the account by the &quot;Continuator of Wace&quot; and others, in his youth Brictric declined the romantic advances of Matilda and his great fiefdom was thereupon seized by her. Whatever the truth of the matter, years later, when she was acting as regent in England for William the Conqueror, she used her authority to confiscate Brictric&#x27;s lands and threw him into prison, where he died. The Exon Domesday notes that Bideford and nearby Littleham were held at fee farm from the king by Gotshelm, a Devonshire tenant-in-chief of 28 manors and brother of Walter de Claville. Gotshelm&#x27;s 28 manors descended to the Honour of Gloucester, as did most of Brictric&#x27;s.

After the death of Matilda in 1083, Brictric&#x27;s lands were granted by her eldest son King William Rufus (1087–1100) to Robert FitzHamon (died 1107), the conqueror of Glamorgan, whose daughter and sole heiress Maud (or Mabel) FitzHamon brought them to her husband Robert de Caen, 1st Earl of Gloucester (pre-1100 – 1147), an illegitimate son of Matilda&#x27;s younger son King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). Thus Brictric&#x27;s fiefdom became the feudal barony of Gloucester. The Grenville family held Bideford for many centuries under the overlordship of the feudal barons of Gloucester, which barony was soon absorbed into the Crown, when they became tenants in chief.

Sir Richard I de Grenville (d. after 1142) (&quot;alias&quot; de Grainvilla, de Greinvill, etc.) was one of the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan who served in the Norman Conquest of Glamorgan under his elder brother Robert FitzHamon (died 1107), the first Norman feudal baron of Gloucester and Lord of Glamorgan from 1075. He obtained from FitzHamon the lordship of Neath, Glamorgan, where he built Neath Castle and in 1129 founded Neath Abbey. Richard de Grenville was one of three (or four) known sons of Hamo Dapifer (died around 1100) Sheriff of Kent, an Anglo-Norman royal official under both King William the Conqueror (1066–1087) and his son King William Rufus (1087–1100). He is by tradition the founder and ancestor of the prominent Westcountry Grenville family of Stowe in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall and of Bideford in Devon.

By tradition Richard de Grenville is said by Prince (died 1723), (apparently following &quot;Fuller&#x27;s Worthies&quot;) to have founded Neath Abbey and bestowed upon it all his military acquisitions for its maintenance, and to have
:&quot;returned to his patrimony at Bideford where he lived in great honour and reputation the rest of his days&quot;.

However, according to Round (died 1928) &quot;no proof exists that Richard I de Grenville ever held the manor of Bideford, which was later one of the principal seats of the West Country Grenville family. It was however certainly one of the constituent manors of the Honour of Gloucester granted by King William Rufus to Robert FitzHamon.&quot; Richard de Grenville is known to have held seven knight&#x27;s fees from the Honour of Gloucester, granted to him either by his brother FitzHamon or by the latter&#x27;s son-in-law and heir Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1100–1147). Round supposes instead that the Grenvilles of Bideford and Stowe were descended from a certain &quot;Robert de Grenville&quot; (&quot;alias&quot; de Grainville, de Grainavilla, etc.) who was a junior witness to Richard&#x27;s foundation charter of Neath Abbey, and who in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return was listed as holding one knight&#x27;s fee from the Earl of Gloucester, feudal baron of Gloucester. Robert&#x27;s familial relationship, if any, to Richard is unknown.

A charter was granted in 1272 to Richard V de Grenville by King Henry III, which created the town&#x27;s first council. In ancient records Bideford was recorded as a borough; but it only returned members to Parliament during the reigns of Edward I (1272–1307) and Edward II (1307–1327).

===1500–1700===

The Grenville family were for many centuries lords of the manor of Bideford and played a major role in the town&#x27;s development. The monument with an effigy of Sir Thomas Grenville (died 1513) exists in St Mary&#x27;s Church. His great-great-grandson Sir Richard Grenville (1542–1591), the captain of the &quot;Revenge&quot;, was born in the manor house in Bideford, formerly situated on the site of numbers 1–3 Bridge Street. He built himself a new mansion on the quayside in 1585. The family had another seat at Stow House, Kilkhampton, near Bude in Cornwall. Grenville played a major role in the transformation of the small fishing port of Bideford in North Devon into what became a significant trading port with the new American colonies, later specialising in tobacco importation. In 1575 he created the Port of Bideford. Grenville was never elected as Mayor of Bideford, preferring instead to support John Salterne in that role, but he was Lord of the Manor, a title held by the Grenvilles since 1126 and finally ceded by his descendants in 1711 to the Town Council he established. On his return from Roanoke Colony Grenville&#x27;s ship &quot;Tiger&quot; captured a Spanish galleon the &quot;Santa Maria de San Vicente&quot; off Bermuda in late August 1585. The Spanish prize was brought into Bideford with riches valued at around 15,000 pounds. Grenville also brought a Native American &quot;Wynganditoian&quot; from Roanoke Island with him after returning from a voyage to America in 1586. Grenville named this Native American tribesman Raleigh after his cousin Sir Walter Raleigh. Raleigh converted to Christianity and was baptised at Saint Mary&#x27;s Church on 27 March 1588, but died from influenza during his residence in Grenville&#x27;s house on 2 April 1589. His interment was at the same church five days later. Sir Richard Grenville&#x27;s great-grandson, Sir John Granville, helped restore Charles II to the throne, and in 1661 Charles made Sir John Granville Baron Granville of Bideford and Earl of Bath.

During the English Civil War, Bideford stood with the Parliamentarians against the Royalist forces of Charles I. Following a series of Royalist successes in the South West during 1643, the Parliamentarians withdrew into Bideford and its two small fortresses, one of which was Chudleigh Fort. Here they were besieged. After further Royalist victories it became clear that Bideford would not be relieved, and in August 1643 it was stormed by Royalist forces. Following fierce fighting around the two forts, the town fell.

In 1646, 229 people in the town were killed by the plague. It was suggested that a Spanish vessel laden with wool which docked at the quay may have brought this plague to Bideford, and that it was children playing with the wool who first got infected with the plague. Victims were buried from 8 June 1646 to 18 January the next year. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the expulsion of French Protestants from France a considerable number of them immigrated to Bideford, and they brought a lot of new trades to the town, including silk weaving.

In the 16th century the merchant and ship owner John Strange was born in the town. When he was in his youth, he fell from a cliff yet did not suffer any injury, then later on in his life someone fired an arrow at his forehead, but it did not penetrate his skull, and the only lasting damage was a scar. Once a malicious person tried to throw him over the Long Bridge, the walls of the bridge being very low, but was unexpectedly and luckily interrupted.

====Witch trial====
The Bideford witch trial in 1682 involved three women, Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles and Susannah Edwards, accused of witchcraft and which resulted in one of the last hangings for witchcraft in England.

===1800–1939===
In 1816 a mob forced their way into Bideford prison to try and break out some of the mob&#x27;s ringleaders, and soldiers from the Royal North Devon Yeomanry had to be mustered, and then patrolled the town, where they arrested several members of the mob who were then escorted to Exeter. In 1835 the Bideford Poor Law Union was founded; followed by the building, in 1837, of the Bideford workhouse in Meddon Street. The workhouse had a 40-bed infirmary and would later become Torridge Hospital and, eventually, a residential building. In 1830 it was reported that 5000 people waved farewell to ships leaving Bideford for New York City, Montreal, and St. Andrews (New Brunswick). Between the years 1840 and 1900 2,467 people emigrated to Canada and 248 to the United States aboard ships from Bideford. In 1847 a horse-drawn omnibus taking people to a fair in Torrington fell off Bideford Quay into the River Torridge, and eight people were drowned. The book &quot;Kingsley&#x27;s County&quot; put the expansion and growth of Bideford down to the publication of Charles Kingsley&#x27;s romance &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; in 1855. There was an extension of the London and South Western Railway from Barnstaple in 1856. The Pannier Market opened in 1884. In 1902 the first car arrived in Bideford: it was owned by Dr E.J. Toye, the car being a 4-1/2 hp Benz.

===World War II===
In 1942 American GIs arrived in Bideford. At first they were there to work in radar stations across North Devon and work on experimental things. More American troops began to arrive as the war progressed. Experiments nearby, including The Great Panjandrum, were said to be viewed in the area in secret by Dwight D. Eisenhower and Sir Winston Churchill at the Strand Cinema. In 1943 more Americans arrived as D-day training had begun at beaches across North Devon During the war Bideford Ordnance Experimental Station Depot O-617 was set up to experiment on waterproofing equipment for the D-day landings. The Americans&#x27; GI camp was at Bowden Green in Bideford, and had plenty of facilities, including a cinema. There was also a vehicle repair shop off the Kingsley Road, and the Pill was taken over by US forces as well. Because of the sheer number of American soldiers in the area by 1943 the American Red Cross opened a club near Chudleigh Fort in East-the-Water. Bideford had an Auxiliary Unit Patrol at Cleave Mine, the men of this patrol were expected to be the resistance if Britain was invaded. During the war 2700 evacuees were expected in Bideford; a large number of these came and stayed throughout the war. During World War II a bomb was dropped on a house in Bowden Green and caused substantial damage. Also during the war an RCAF bomber crashed in East the Water; three men were killed and one badly injured. A memorial has been put on the Tarka Trail to commemorate this. It is also thought that during the war there was an experimental Royal Navy unit testing a secret petrol pipeline in the river. It is thought that after being rescued in the Bristol Channel, some German airman were brought ashore at Bideford, where they were taken to Bideford Hospital. There was also a POW camp at Handy Cross. It has been discovered that the Nazis had a map of Bideford in readiness for a possible invasion, also that the Nazis had an aerial picture of the area for intelligence purposes.

===Long Bridge===

The original Long Bridge spanning the River Torridge connecting the East and West of the town was said to have been built out of timber in the year 1286. In 1474 the original structure was replaced by the masonry arch bridge seen today. The bridge was built around the timber so people could still use it while construction was taking place, possibly resulting in the 24 arches all being of different sizes. A traditional explanation is that each arch was funded by a different local guild, although there are no records to confirm this. Another theory is that the piers of the arches of the bridge were built on naturally existing, and therefore randomly situated, large stones in the river. During the first decade of the 17th century, the bridge trustees were taken to court by the people of Bideford for feasting and seeing plays at the expense of the trust funds. The people won the court case, although it is unclear whether the trustees were forced to resign after the scandal, or whatever else happened to them. In 1790 the bridge was the longest in Devon. In the 1820s there was talk of converting the bridge so that it could be raised and lowered to allow larger boats and ships to pass under it. In 1886 a Ship called &#x27;Edward Birkbeck&#x27; launched from a Bideford shipyard hit the bridge, but only caused small damage by knocking some of the stones out. In 1925 another incident took place on the bridge: during the widening of the bridge a lorry came off the side of the bridge and crashed into the River Torridge, and it is believed that both the people in the lorry survived. During World War II the 10th arch of the bridge was being repaired, and the police asked for ladders and scaffolding to be removed from the bridge to prevent potential invaders climbing up and capturing the bridge. During the war the Home Guard patrolled the bridge. The Bideford Bridge Trust held responsibility for the long bridge right up until the year 1968 when one of the arches of the bridge collapsed. The Department of Transport then took over the bridge. During the rebuilding of that damaged part of the bridge a crane toppled over, and a man was killed. An inspection by Devon County Council in July 2007 revealed problems with the bridge&#x27;s concrete and structure, so in September 2008 work began on putting in the cathodic protection system which restored the bridge for another 60 years. A sight which many holiday-makers and locals enjoy is seeing the starlings at dusk, as they roost underneath the bridge.

===Port and shipping===
By the 16th century Bideford had become Britain&#x27;s third largest port. Sir Walter Raleigh landed his first shipment of tobacco here, although, contrary to popular belief, he was not the first to import tobacco to England. Several local roads and a hill have been named after Raleigh. Bideford was heavily involved in the transport of indentured servants to the New World colonies. Bideford also was heavily involved in the Newfoundland cod trade from the 16th century to the mid-18th century. 28 Bideford vessels with a tonnage of 3860 were involved in this practice in the year 1700. In the years 1706, 1707, 1726 and 1758 fishermen of Bideford sent petitions demanding the building of a fort in Newfoundland to protect them from Native Americans and the French. Bideford also imported large amounts of Irish wool in the 18th century.

Two prominent shipbuilders in Bideford were George Crocker and Richard Chapman: they built a large number of ships. A number of ships have been built in Bideford, including HMS &quot;Acorn&quot;, an 18-gun sloop launched in 1807; and , , and HMS &quot;Ontario&quot;, which were all 18-gun s, and were both 22-gun Royal Navy &quot;Laurel&quot;-class post ships, and HMS &quot;Meda&quot;, a harbour defence motor launch was built and launched in the town. Around 150 ships were built between 1840 and 1877 at Higher Cleave Houses in Bideford. The largest wooden ship to be built in Bideford was the &quot;Sarah Newman&quot;, a 1,004-ton full-rigged ship built in 1855. During the 19th century over 815 registered wooden sailing ships were launched on the Torridge, as too were hundreds of unregistered craft. Shipbuilding in the Bideford area declined during the 1890s as shipyards in Britain&#x27;s industrial regions constructed steel steamships. The last wooden merchant ship launched in the River Torridge was the schooner &quot;PT Harris&quot; from the Hubbastone yard of PK Harris &amp; Sons, in 1912.

During World War II a was named , also four sixth-rate ships of the line have been named after the town. Nowadays the only shipbuilding in the area is at Appledore Shipbuilders, which has built civilian ships and ships for the Royal Navy and Irish Naval Service. Currently ball clay is exported from Bideford to Castellón, Spain and also Naantali, Finland; also wood has been exported to Wismar, Germany. The , the last remaining British-built wooden-hull three-masted topsail schooner, is registered in Bideford and was at one time based there. There are also some fishing boats that still operate out of Bideford.
===Late 20th century===
In 1966, Bideford Zoo was built by Mrs K. Tottenham and opened on the 29th May 1966. The original inhabitants included sea lions, bears and raccoons. It finally closed in October 1970. The site is now a housing estate, and the old zoo house known as &quot;Ford House&quot; has now been converted into flats.

===Literary references===
This area of North Devon was home to the author Charles Kingsley, and is where he based his novel &quot;Westward Ho!&quot;. A small seaside town, named after the book, was built after the book&#x27;s publication.

Westward Ho!, the only town in the United Kingdom which officially contains an exclamation mark in its name, is approximately three miles (5 km) from Bideford. A statue was erected in honour of Kingsley near the car park of Victoria Park.

===Namesakes===
The city of Biddeford, Maine, in the United States was named after the English town, using the original old English spelling. Also, the town of Bideford in the province of Prince Edward Island, Canada, is named after the English town, as is the small town of Bideford, New Zealand.

===Bideford Black===
Bideford Black is a unique pigment which was mined for 200 years up until 1969 in Bideford and the surrounding area. The deposits were formed 350 million years ago during the Carboniferous period on Gondwana. Bideford Black contains carbon, silica and alumina, with the black colouration created by the carbon. The seams containing Bideford Black Stretch from Hartland, underneath Bideford, and onto Umberleigh. Bideford Black was used in a number of ways; for example, it was used as camouflage paint during World War II, in mascara by Max Factor, by artists, and in the boat-building industry. Bideford Black was processed as a paint and a dye up until the mining stopped. A number of artists (mainly local artists) used these Bideford Black paints and oils in their works. The Bideford Black Mining Company produced Biddiblack powder at a processing plant in Chapel Park, East-the-Water. Some of the miners&#x27; houses were situated at Springfield Terrace, East-the-Water.

The mining of the pigment became unviable when other blacks went into large, cheap commercial production. Bideford Black has also been known as &quot;The Mother of Coal&quot;; there are still a number of places where evidence of the mine can be seen, like old mine entrances just off the Barnstaple road. A number of roads are named after the mining in the town, including Mines Road, Pitt Lane, Biddiblack Way and other roads.

Recently some Bideford Black was exchanged, by locals, for some pigments provided by Australian Aboriginal Elder Noel Butler. Noel Butler&#x27;s nephew has used the Bideford Black to paint his body for Aboriginal ceremonial events in Australia. The Heritage lottery fund has given a grant of £8700 to the Burton Art Gallery to fund research into Bideford Black. In October 2013 a display about Bideford Black was presented at Bideford&#x27;s Burton Art Gallery.

The birth rate in Bideford is 60.2 out of 1000 women, compared with the 52.8 per 1000 women which is the average for Devon. Life expectancy in Bideford is 80.7 years, that is 0.9 years less than the average for Devon. Bideford has the highest rate of youth offending in Devon at 21.5 in 1000 people, compared with 13.2 in a 1000 people as the Devon average.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Bideford is served by the A39 Atlantic Highway and A386 roads.

===Ferry===
A ferry operates between Bideford quay and Lundy Island, approximately away in the Bristol Channel. The same ship, the MS &quot;Oldenburg&quot;, also provides evening cruises downstream from Bideford along the River Torridge.

===South West Coast Path===
The South West Coast Path National Trail runs through the town, and gives access to the North Devon coast.

===Buses===

Bus services are provided by Stagecoach South West; key routes include:

===Railway===
The nearest railway station is at Barnstaple away. Bideford was previously connected to the national rail network, but the connection was lost in 1982 (by then a freight branch, which was still operating due to the mining of ball clay traffic from Meeth Quarry) with the closure of the line from Barnstaple to Torrington and Meeth Quarry. Passenger services were closed in 1965 following the publication of the Beeching Report. The station still exists at East-the-Water and is now managed by a preservation group, the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre. The line followed the contours of the River Torridge for much of its route to Torrington and most of it is part of the Tarka Trail.

In 2009, &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot; attempted to run OO gauge trains on a temporary track on the right of way. A subsequent attempt in 2011 was successful.

In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies costed reopening the Barnstaple to Bideford route at £80 million. But in 2010 Devon County Council rejected proposals by Torridge District Council to consider reopening.

====Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway====
The Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway was an unusual and short-lived railway built entirely on this peninsula with no direct connection to the rest of the British railway network. The locomotives were fitted with skirts to protect pedestrians, as at one point the line ran along the quay at Bideford. The line had eleven halts which largely served visitors wishing to enjoy the scenery along the coast or the beaches around Westward Ho!. The railway, although authorised in 1896, was opened only as far as Northam by 1901, and finally reached Appledore in 1908.

The railway fell into financial difficulties and in the First World War, the War Department requisitioned all of its equipment for use in France. Bideford&#x27;s 13th-century Long Bridge was temporarily converted into a railway bridge to carry the locomotives and rolling stock onto the main line railway near Bideford Station.
==Climate==
Bideford has a wet but mild climate; during the winter Bideford experiences a lot of changeable weather conditions, mild cloudy/ drizzly weather off the Atlantic with daytime temperatures typically 11/12c and mild nights in high single figures, alternating with clear periods which can allow for frosty nights and early mornings with temperatures-2/-4c and maybe only 4-5c by day: Bideford also gets some snow but it rarely settles for long. During the summer Bideford can experience wet and unsettled weather off the Atlantic but also can be one of the warmest places in Devon when warm continental air masses move up off the continent and in 2022 a short heatwave around 17–18 July produced record warmth with temperatures pushing 35c and overnight lows in the high teens.


==East-the-Water==
The town of Bideford has grown to cover land on both sides of the River Torridge; the area located east of the river is known as East-the-Water and also spelled East the Water without hyphens. Much of the land that has been built on in recent years is drained marshland.

East-the-Water has its own primary school, local shops, a few factories, approximately 3 bars and pubs, a small health centre and a small industrial area consisting largely of locally owned businesses. It is mainly public housing, especially on the Pollyfield estate. The community also has its own community centre and association, both of which are self-funding and run by a committee of local residents. A key historical feature is Chudleigh Fort, built by the Parliamentarian Major-General James Chudleigh during the English Civil War. The area is surrounded by agricultural land.
Buried in the now abandoned and neglected East-the-Water Cemetery in adjacent plots are Victoria Cross recipients Gerald Graham and George Channer.

==Governance==

Bideford Town Council, which is based at Bideford Town Hall, has 16 seats representing four unequal wards, North, South, East and South Outer. At the May 2011 local elections, seven Conservatives, three independents, two Liberal Democrats, two Labour and one Green were elected (there was one vacant seat). There is a mayor and Town Clerk. The town council received widespread attention in February 2012 when the High Court ruled that prayers as part of meetings were not lawful by the Local Government Act 1972.

Torridge District Council is the next level of local government and most decisions are made by Devon County Council. Torridge District Council is responsible for maintaining Bideford Higher Cemetery.

The local MP is the Conservative Geoffrey Cox. The two Devon County Council councillors who represent the town are Anthony Inch and Linda Hellyer, they are both members of the Conservative Party.

==Education==
State-funded primary schools in Bideford include East-the-Water Primary School, St. Mary&#x27;s Church of England Primary School and Westcroft School. Bideford College is the main state-funded secondary school serving the area.

Kingsley School is a co-educational independent school situated in Bideford. It was founded in 2009 when Grenville College and Edgehill College merged. It is a member of the Methodist Independent Schools trust.

==Religion==

Bideford has a number of churches:

* St Mary&#x27;s Church is Church of England and one of the largest in the town; the clock on the 13th-century tower is visible throughout the town. The church building was rebuilt in 1862-5 when the original Norman church was pulled down and is Grade II* listed. The church enjoys a healthy relationship with the St. Mary&#x27;s C of E Primary School, which is in the town; children from the school attend a number of services at the church during school time.
* Bideford Baptist Church&#x27;s Sunday services include Communion on the 1st and 3rd Sunday of each month.*
* The Abundant Life Church meets at the Bideford Youth Centre on the Pill and holds a number of events.
* The Lavington United Reformed Church is in Bridgeland Street; the current building opened in 1869.
* The Sacred Heart Catholic Church is situated on Northam Road.
* The Bethel Free Church is located in East-the-Water.
* There is also a Methodist church in Bideford High Street. In North Road there is an Evangelical Chapel.
* The Religious Society of Friends has a Quaker Meeting House in Honestone Street, opposite the entrance to the Pannier Market car park.
* St Peter&#x27;s Church, in East-the-Water, was built over 130 years ago. It has not been worshipped in for 10 years and is now in use as a gymnasium.

In 2011, 61.8% of people in Bideford and nearby Northam described themselves as Christian, 0.3% as Buddhist, 0.2% as Muslims and 0.7% were classed as part of the other religion category. The number of religious people in the area is higher than the average in Devon.

==Culture==

===New Year traditions===
Bideford is renowned for its New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations, when thousands of people – most in fancy dress – from surrounding towns, villages, and around the world gather on the quay for revelries and a fireworks display. The event normally includes a number of local musical acts performing on the X Radio One Roadshow stage.
Andrew&#x27;s Dole is a custom dating from 1605. In that year, the Mayor of Bideford, Andrew Dole, established a trust to provide for loaves of bread to be distributed to poor, elderly, persons who applied at the Mayor&#x27;s Parlour. The custom continues to this day and takes place on New Year&#x27;s Day. He also left some land to trustees and the income is distributed to 10 deserving people, for each trustee.

===Radio===
Local radio was provided by Heart North Devon. The station, which started in 1992 and originally called Lantern FM, was based in Bideford in a building named &quot;the Lighthouse&quot;, and later moved to an industrial estate in nearby Barnstaple. In April 2009, the station was rebranded as part of the Heart Network, losing the long-standing Lantern FM name. In August 2010, amid much controversy, the station was merged with its sister operations in other areas of Devon and all operations were moved to new studios in Exeter and renamed Heart Devon. As a result, numerous members of staff at Barnstaple were made redundant. Since then, many of the Lantern FM team, past and present, have reunited to create The Voice, a local radio station currently broadcasting across Devon on DAB Digital radio. The radio station was launched on FM in January 2014 after being granted an FM Licence.

===Television===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Huntshaw Cross TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter situated in Westward Ho!.

===Newspapers===
Bideford is covered by two main local newspapers, the &quot;North Devon Gazette&quot; and the &quot;North Devon Journal&quot; which are published weekly. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was founded in Bideford, and was originally known as the &quot;Bideford Gazette&quot;. It is now a free newspaper, delivered to most local homes, and is now based in Barnstaple. The regional daily paper, the &quot;Western Morning News&quot;, is also available. A local newsletter, the &quot;Bideford Buzz&quot;, was published monthly from 2000- 18 by a team of volunteers, and from October 2018 is available online only.

===Twinning===
The town is twinned with Landivisiau in France. It has been twinned with Landivisiau since 1976; each year members of the Bideford Twinning Association take part in an exchange trip with Landivisiau.
On 20 October 2006, British ex-patriate David Riley came to mark the &#x27;20-year link&#x27; between Manteo on Roanoke Island, North Carolina, and Bideford. The Bideford town clerk, George McLauchlan, told him that locals had never heard of Manteo, and that the only town Bideford was twinned with was in France. Mr Riley handed over a clock to &#x27;celebrate&#x27; the twenty-year link, while the Manteo Town manager Kermit Skinner said the link started in the 1980s during the 400th anniversary of Raleigh&#x27;s voyages to America.
It turns out the &#x27;twinning&#x27; of Bideford with Manteo had been established 20 years before. But the story goes back much further – 500 years – to the mysterious disappearance of a colony of more than 100 people on Roanoke Island, many of whom were immigrants from Bideford. The colony was established by Sir Richard Grenville, who brought back two Native American Indians, one of them called Manteo which gave the North Carolina town its name.

===Art===

Bideford Art School was located on The Quay from 1896 to the 1970s. Alumni included Judith Ackland and novelist Rosemary Sutcliff. Today the building houses Bideford Arts Centre. The Burton at Bideford is an art gallery and museum in the town that has collections on various things of interest connected with Bideford&#x27;s heritage, including clay pipes and tea caddies. The art gallery displays work by local artists featuring local heritage and local landscapes.

===Bideford Film Society===

The Bideford Film Society was set up in 2001 and with the aid of a grant from the Bridge Trust and Bideford Town Council. The Bideford Film Society shows films just after their cinema release. The films are screened at Kingsley School, or in the Devon Hall at Bideford College.

===Markets===

In 1272 Bideford was granted a market charter, and has had many markets throughout the years. The medieval market was once held near to where the bottom of the High Street is today. The current Pannier Market has been there since 1884, and consists of a large market hall which, as well as markets, hosts boxing matches and other events; and Butchers Row which is now made up of small shops, galleries, and butchers&#x27; stalls.

A farmers&#x27; market takes place on the quay on nearly every Saturday throughout the summer. A continental market also visits Bideford annually – market traders from France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Holland, Poland and other countries come to sell products on the quay.

===Shopping===

Bideford has many small shops and galleries. Affinity Devon, formerly Atlantic Village, is an outlet shopping centre on the western outskirts of the town: it has over thirty retail outlets Opposite Affinity Devon is Atlantic Park, a collection of restaurants, supermarkets and hotel chains built in 2015. This destroyed large parts of Moreton Park Woods and was campaigned against by local residents.

==Sport and recreation==

Bideford has two King George&#x27;s Fields, which are memorials to King George V. One field is used primarily as the home ground of the main local rugby union club, Bideford RFC (Chiefs) who currently play in Counties 1 Western West.

The other field, commonly referred to as &quot;The Sports Ground&quot;, is the home to Bideford AFC, the town&#x27;s main local football club, they currently play in the Southern Football League Division One South and are managed by Sean William Joyce. In over 60 seasons, the club has never been relegated, a distinction it shares only with Arsenal and Everton.

East-the-Water also has its own football club, Shamwickshire Rovers FC, which plays at Pollyfield.

There is a cricket club in the park called Victoria Park Cricket Club, but there is also Bideford, Littleham and Westward Ho! Cricket Club and they play in Westward Ho!

There are two bowling clubs in the town, one is Bideford Bowling Club who play near to The Sports Ground, and the other is Bideford Victoria Park Bowling Club.

There is also a gymnastics club in the town called the North Devon Display Gymnastic Club.

In 2009 the sixth stage of the Tour of Britain finished in the town, and large crowds lined the quay where it finished. In 2012 the Tour of Britain passed through the town, again large crowds came out to watch.

On 19 March 2012 the 2012 Olympic torch relay passed through the town, when large crowds lined the town&#x27;s streets, and school children from the town&#x27;s schools were also allowed to line the route – even though it was during the school day.

<text>With the Beatles is the second studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released in the United Kingdom on 22 November 1963 on Parlophone, eight months after the release of the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. Produced by George Martin, the album features eight original compositions (seven by Lennon–McCartney and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, George Harrison&#x27;s first recorded solo composition) and six covers (mostly of rock and roll and Motown R&amp;B hits). The sessions also yielded the non-album single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; backed by &quot;This Boy&quot;. The cover photograph was taken by the fashion photographer Robert Freeman and has since been mimicked by several music groups. A different cover was used for the Australian release of the album, which the Beatles were displeased with.

In the United States, the album&#x27;s tracks were unevenly split over the group&#x27;s first two albums released on Capitol Records: &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; and &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;. It was also released in Canada under the name &quot;Beatlemania! With the Beatles&quot;. The album was ranked number 420 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2010). It was also voted number 275 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

==Recording==
In 1963, musical groups were typically required to release more than one LP a year. As such, the Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin and manager Brian Epstein planned for the band to release two LPs and four singles every year. Shortly after recording the non-album single &quot;She Loves You&quot; on 1 July 1963, the Beatles returned to London&#x27;s EMI Studios only four months after the release of &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. Unlike their debut, the bulk of whose tracks (10 of the 14, excluding previously issued singles) were recorded in one day, &quot;With the Beatles&quot; was recorded over seven sessions across three months. On 18 July, the group tracked four covers: Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, Barrett Strong&#x27;s &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;, the Donays&#x27; &quot;Devil in His Heart&quot;, albeit retitled &quot;Devil in Her Heart&quot;, and Meredith Willson&#x27;s &quot;Till There Was You&quot;, although this recording was deemed unsatisfactory.

The Beatles reconvened at the studio on the morning of 30 July, recording a cover of the Marvelettes&#x27; &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot; and beginning work on the first new Lennon–McCartney song, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot;. Following a break to record a BBC radio session for &quot;Saturday Club&quot;, they returned in the late-afternoon, recording overdubs on &quot;Money&quot;, a remake of &quot;Till There Was You&quot; and a cover of Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;. The session ended with finishing touches on &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot; and recording Paul McCartney&#x27;s &quot;All My Loving&quot;, which Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn described as &quot;by far his best, most complex piece of songwriting yet.&quot; &quot;She Loves You&quot;, backed by &quot;I&#x27;ll Get You&quot;, was issued as a single on 23 August and was the group&#x27;s first single to sell over a million copies in Britain alone.

After a break, the Beatles returned to EMI on 11 September 1963. They attempted John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Little Child&quot; and drummer Ringo Starr&#x27;s vocal contribution to the album, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, a Lennon–McCartney original that was given to the Rolling Stones, who released it as their second single; both attempts were deemed unsatisfactory. The group started and finished Lennon&#x27;s compositions &quot;All I&#x27;ve Got to Do&quot; and &quot;Not a Second Time&quot;, and began recording Harrison&#x27;s first solo composition, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, which was also left unfinished. The next day, the band remade &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot;, which was attempted earlier in the year on 11 February, finished &quot;Little Child&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;, but again left &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; unfinished. On 30 September, Martin added piano and Hammond organ overdubs to &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, respectively, while the band were on holidays. The band returned on 3 October, recording more takes of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;.

Four-track recording was installed at EMI before the 17 October session, when the Beatles recorded their new non-album single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; / &quot;This Boy&quot;, as well as speeches for a Christmas record for the band&#x27;s fan club. The band finished up &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; on 23 October before Martin commenced mono and stereo mixing the same day and continuing six days later. Final preparations were made on 30 October, with the album officially completed on 4 November.

==Packaging==
Impressed with Robert Freeman&#x27;s black-and-white pictures of John Coltrane, Epstein invited the photographer to create the cover image. Harrison later said that, whereas the cover of &quot;Please Please Me&quot; had been &quot;crap&quot;, their second LP was &quot;the beginning of us being actively involved in the Beatles&#x27; artwork... the first one where we thought, &#x27;Hey, let&#x27;s get artistic.&#x27;&quot; The group asked Freeman to take inspiration from pictures their friend Astrid Kirchherr had taken in Hamburg between 1960 and 1962, featuring the band members in half-shadow and not smiling. To achieve this result, on 22 August 1963, Freeman photographed them in a dark corridor of the Palace Court Hotel in Bournemouth, where the band were playing a summer residency at the local Gaumont Cinema. To fit the square format of the cover, he put Starr in the bottom right corner, &quot;since he was the last to join the group. He was also the shortest&quot;. McCartney described the result as &quot;very moody&quot;, adding: &quot;people think he must have worked at [it] forever and ever. But it was an hour. He sat down, took a couple of rolls, and he had it.&quot; 

The original concept was to paint the picture from edge to edge, with no bleeding, title or artist credit – a concept that went against music industry practice and was immediately vetoed by EMI. The first album to carry an edge-to-edge cover was the Rolling Stones&#x27; self-titled debut, released five months later. EMI also objected to the fact that the Beatles were not smiling; it was only after George Martin intervened, as head of Parlophone, that the cover portrait was approved. Freeman was paid £75 for his work, which was three times the fee first offered by EMI.

Music critic John Harris finds the cover most reminiscent of the photos Kirchherr took in Hamburg of Lennon, Harrison and Stuart Sutcliffe using the &quot;half-lit technique&quot; and says that, together with songs such as &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot;, &quot;With the Beatles&quot; thereby represents &quot;a canny repackaging of their early &#x27;60s incarnation: Hamburg shorn of Prellies and leather, and sold to their public as a mixture of accomplished rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and art-house cool&quot;. Harris also sees the LP cover as a &quot;watershed&quot; design that encouraged other acts to eschew &quot;the more cartoonish aspects of pop photography&quot; and continued to exert an influence in the 1970s on covers such as those for Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Transformer&quot; (1972), Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Horses&quot; (1975) and various punk rock albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

EMI Australia did not receive the cover art (there were union restrictions on importing negatives for printing) and used different shots of the band in a similar style to the black-and-white photograph on other releases. The Beatles were unaware of this until fans showed them the cover during their only Australian tour, and informed the EMI publicity staff that they were not pleased with the substitution.

==Release and reception==
Parlophone issued &quot;With the Beatles&quot; on 22 November 1963, eight months to the day after &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, with the catalogue number PMC 1206. The album became the first Beatles album released in North America when it was released in Canada on 25 November 1963 under the augmented title &quot;Beatlemania! With the Beatles&quot;, with additional text on the album cover, and issued only in mono at the time, catalogue number T 6051 (a stereo Canadian release would come in 1968, catalogue number ST 6051). For the United States release, the original running order of &quot;With the Beatles&quot; was unevenly split over the group&#x27;s first two Capitol albums: nine tracks were issued on &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; (the eight original compositions plus &quot;Till There Was You&quot;), while the remaining five songs, all cover versions, were placed on &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Second Album&quot;.

The LP had advance orders of a half million and sold another half million by September 1965, making it the second album to sell a million copies in the United Kingdom, after the soundtrack to the 1958 film &quot;South Pacific&quot;. &quot;With the Beatles&quot; remained at the top of the charts for 21 weeks, displacing &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, so that the Beatles occupied the top spot for 51 consecutive weeks. It even reached number 11 in the &quot;singles charts&quot; (because at the time UK charts counted all records sold, regardless of format). No other group or singer has achieved 51 consecutive weeks at number 1 in the album charts. However, the soundtrack for &quot;South Pacific&quot; did achieve 70 consecutive weeks at number one in the album charts. Reviewing the album on release for &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Peter Jones hailed &quot;With the Beatles&quot; as an improvement over &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, praising the covers and originals, particularly Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;.

On 26 February 1987, &quot;With the Beatles&quot; was officially released on compact disc (in mono only, catalogue number CDP 7 46436 2). Having been available only as an import in the US in the past, the album was also issued domestically in the US on LP and cassette on 21 July 1987. Along with the rest of the Beatles&#x27; canon, it was re-released on CD in newly re-mastered stereo and mono versions on 9 September 2009.

The album was ranked number 420 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003, and was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 275 in the third edition of English writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. It was rated the 29th greatest album in the book &quot;Paul Gambaccini Presents the Top 100 Albums&quot;. This book &quot;canvassed a panel of experts in seven countries&quot; to determine the greatest albums.

<text>Lucius Accius (; 170 – c. 86 BC), or Lucius Attius, was a Roman tragic poet and literary scholar. Accius was born in 170 BC at Pisaurum, a town founded in the Ager Gallicus in 184 BC. He was the son of a freedman and a freedwoman, probably from Rome.

The year of his death is unknown, but he must have lived to a great age, since Cicero (born 106 BC, hence 64 years younger) writes of having conversed with him on literary matters.

==Literary works==
Accius was a prolific writer and enjoyed a very high reputation. The titles and considerable fragments (about 700 lines) of some fifty plays have been preserved. Judging from the titles and fragments, scholars have surmised that most, if not all, of these poems were tragic in nature, although Pliny the Younger ranks him among the erotic poets. His career as a poet can be traced over the course of 36 years from B.C. 140, to B.C. 104.

Most of his poetical works were imitations or free translations of the Greek, especially Aeschylus. The earliest of these was most likely the &quot;Atreus&quot;, which was performed in 140, but is now lost. He also wrote on some Roman subjects, one of which, an examination of the tyranny of L. Tarquinius Superbus and his expulsion by Lucius Junius Brutus, was titled &quot;Brutus&quot;, and was probably written in honor of his patron D. Brutus. His favorite subjects were the legends of the Trojan War and the house of Pelops. While only fragments remain, the most important of which were preserved by Cicero, they seem sufficient to justify the terms of admiration in which Accius is spoken of by the ancient writers. He is particularly praised for the strength and vigor of his language, and the sublimity of his thoughts. Although the grandiloquence of his literary style was on occasion mocked by some of his peers, he continued to be cited by other writers long after his death.

Accius wrote other works of a literary character: &quot;Libri Didascalicon&quot;, a treatise in verse on the history of Greek and Roman poetry, and dramatic art in particular; also &quot;Libri Pragmaticon&quot;, &quot;Parerga&quot;, and &quot;Praxidica&quot;, of which no fragments remain; and a hexameter &quot;Annales&quot; containing the history of Rome, like that of Ennius.

==As a grammarian==
Accius also attempted to introduce innovations in Latin orthography and grammar, most of which were attempts to change written Latin to more faithfully reproduce its actual pronunciation. Few of these caught on, although his preference against giving Greek names Latin endings had quite a few supporters, particularly Varro, who dedicated his &quot;De antiquitate litterarum&quot; to Accius.

A spelling convention of writing long vowels double (such as &quot;aa&quot; for long &quot;ā&quot;) is also associated with him and is found in texts concurrent with his lifetime.

==Politics and temperament==
Accius was politically conservative, and generally noted for his dignity and reserve. He did, however, believe that one with literary gifts, such as himself, ought to be accorded more respect than someone who, through no effort of their own, was merely born into the nobility. He was, by some accounts, a self-important man, and some writers expressed a wry amusement at the larger-than-life statues of himself that he had erected in the temple of the Muses.

A fragment of Accius&#x27; play &quot;Atreus&quot; features the line &quot;oderint dum metuant&quot; (&quot;let them hate, so long as they fear&quot;).

<text>Glasses, also known as eyeglasses, spectacles, or colloquially as specs, are vision eyewear with clear or tinted lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person&#x27;s eyes, typically utilizing a bridge over the nose and hinged arms, known as temples or temple pieces, that rest over the ears for support.

Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness; however, without the specialized lenses, they are sometimes used for cosmetic purposes. 
Safety glasses provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection on the sides of the eyes as well as in the lenses. Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash.

Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck to prevent the loss and breaking of the glasses.

Sunglasses allow for better vision in bright daylight and are used to protect one&#x27;s eyes against damage from excessive levels of ultraviolet light. Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; photochromic glasses are clear or lightly tinted in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when they come into contact with ultraviolet light. Most over-the-counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be made. People with conditions that have photophobia as a primary symptom (like certain migraine disorders) often wear sunglasses or precision tinted glasses, even indoors and at night.

Specialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example, 3D glasses for 3D films (stereoscopy). There are also blue light glasses that people wear to protect their eyes from harmful bluelight in computer screens, phones, and other technological devices. Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, metal, wire, and other materials for frames. Most glasses lens are made of plastic, polyethylene, and glass.

== Types ==
Glasses can be marked or found by their primary function, but also appear in combinations such as prescription sunglasses or safety glasses with enhanced magnification.

=== Corrective ===

Corrective lenses are used to correct refractive errors by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hypermetropia) or astigmatism. The ability of one&#x27;s eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which is caused by the eye&#x27;s crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Few people have a pair of eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one eye may need a &quot;stronger&quot; (i.e. more refracting) lens than the other.

Corrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer&#x27;s visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting.

The most common type of corrective lens is &quot;single vision&quot;, which has a uniform refractive index. For people with presbyopia and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. Lenses can also be manufactured with high refractive indices, which allow them to be more lightweight and thinner than their counterparts with &quot;low&quot; refractive indices.

Reading glasses provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from drugstores, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have a pair of simple lenses of equal power, and so will not correct refraction problems like astigmatism or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For the total correction of the individual&#x27;s sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required.

People who need glasses to see often have corrective lens restrictions on their driver&#x27;s licenses that require them to wear their glasses every time they drive or risk fines or jail time.

Some militaries issue prescription glasses to servicemen and women. These are typically GI glasses. Many state prisons in the United States issue glasses to inmates, often in the form of clear plastic aviators.

Adjustable-focus eyeglasses might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they do not have to be custom-manufactured for every person).

Pinhole glasses are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change focal length. Instead, they create a diffraction limited system, which has an increased depth of field, similar to using a small aperture in photography. This form of correction has many limitations that prevent it from gaining popularity in everyday use. Pinhole glasses can be made in a DIY fashion by making small holes in a piece of card which is then held in front of the eyes with a strap or cardboard arms.

Glasses may also house other corrective or assistive devices. After the development of the transistor in the 1940s, combined eyeglass-hearing aids became popular. With thick-rimmed glasses the fashion at the time, a hearing aid could be concealed in the temple part of the frame. These fell out of fashion after the 1970s, but there are still occasions when combined eyeglass-hearing aids may be useful.

=== Safety ===

Safety glasses are worn to protect the eyes in various situations. They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients&#x27; blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full-sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called &quot;flash goggles&quot; because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protective eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes as well as in front of the eyes.

=== Sunglasses ===

Sunglasses provide more comfort and protection against bright light and often against ultraviolet (UV) light. To properly protect the eyes from the dangers of UV light, sunglasses should have UV-400 blocker to provide good coverage against the entire light spectrum that poses a danger.

Light polarization is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed. Liquid-crystal displays emit polarized light, making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include tea shades and mirrorshades. Many blind people wear nearly opaque glasses to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons. Many people with light sensitivity conditions wear sunglasses or other tinted glasses to make the light more tolerable.

Sunglasses may also have corrective lenses, which requires a prescription. Clip-on sunglasses or sunglass clips can be attached to another pair of glasses. Some wrap-around sunglasses are large enough to be worn over another pair of glasses. Otherwise, many people opt to wear contact lenses to correct their vision so that standard sunglasses can be used.

=== Mixed double-frame (Flip glasses) ===

The double frame uplifting glasses have one moving frame with one pair of lenses and the basic fixed frame with another pair of lenses (optional), that are connected by four-bar linkage. For example, sun lenses could be easily lifted up and down while mixed with myopia lenses that always stay on. Presbyopia lenses could be also combined and easily removed from the field of view if needed without taking off glasses. These glasses are often used for drivers going through tunnels, with the upper frame serving as sunglasses and the second frame as transparent lenses.

=== 3D glasses ===

The illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering a signal containing information for both eyes. The signal, often light reflected off a movie screen or emitted from an electronic display, is filtered so that each eye receives a slightly different image. The filters only work for the type of signal they were designed for.

Anaglyph 3D glasses have a different colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A polarized 3D system on the other hand uses polarized filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An active shutter 3D system uses electronic shutters. Head-mounted displays can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewer&#x27;s eyes.

Anaglyph and polarized glasses are distributed to audiences at 3D movies. Polarized and active shutter glasses are used with many home theaters. Head-mounted displays are used by a single person, but the input signal can be shared between multiple units.

=== Magnification (bioptics) ===
Glasses can also provide magnification that is useful for people with vision impairments or specific occupational demands. An example would be &quot;bioptics&quot; or &quot;bioptic telescopes&quot; which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses. Newer designs use smaller lightweight telescopes, which can be embedded into the corrective glass and improve aesthetic appearance (mini telescopic spectacles). They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble goggles or binoculars, or may be attached to existing glasses.
=== Recumbent glasses ===
Recumbent or prism glasses are glasses that use a prism with a 90° refraction to allow the wearer to read or view a screen while lying on their back. Developed by Liverpudlian ophthalmologist Andrew McKie Reid in the 1930s to assist people bedbound by chronic illness or spinal injury, recumbent glasses have more recently been marketed not simply as an assistive device but also as &#x27;lazy glasses&#x27;. They do not assist with vision, although they can be worn over regular corrective glasses.

=== Yellow-tinted computer/gaming glasses ===
Yellow-tinted glasses are a type of glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform a slight color correction, on top of reducing eyestrain from lack of blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective non-prescription glasses. Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light. This allows for reduced eye-strain. These glasses can be ordered as standard or prescription lenses that fit into standard optical frames.

=== Blue-light blocking glasses ===

By the end of the 2010s, eyeglasses that filter out blue light from computers, smartphones and tablets are becoming increasingly popular in response to concerns about problems caused by blue light overexposure.
The problems claimed range from dry eyes to eye strain, sleep cycle disruption, up to macular degeneration which can cause partial blindness. They may also block out ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, there is no measurable UV light from computer monitors. The problem of computer vision syndrome (CVS) can result from focusing the eyes on a screen for long, continuous periods. Many times the glasses do not appear to have much of a tint, or, if any, a slight yellow tint, but they may be more heavily tinted.

Long hours of computer use (not blue light) may cause eye strain.
Many eye symptoms caused by computer use will lessen after the usage of the computer is stopped.
Decreasing evening screen time and setting devices to night mode will improve sleep.
Several studies have shown that blue light from computers does not lead to eye diseases, including macular degeneration. The total amount of light entering the eyes can be adjusted without glasses using the screen brightness settings. Similarly, the blue light can often specifically be adjusted using the &quot;night mode&quot; of different operating systems, which can usually be activated outside of nighttime hours.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) does not recommend special eyewear for computer use,
although it recommends using prescription glasses measured specifically for computer screen distance (depending on individuals, but possibly 20–26 inches from the face), which are not the same as &quot;blue-light blocking&quot; glasses.
The position of the College of Optometrists (UK) is that &quot;the best scientific evidence currently available does not support the use of blue-blocking spectacle lenses in the general population to improve visual performance, alleviate the symptoms of eye fatigue or visual discomfort, improve sleep quality or conserve macula health.&quot;

== Frames ==

The ophthalmic frame is the part of a pair of glasses that is designed to hold the lenses in the proper position.
Ophthalmic frames come in a variety of styles, sizes, materials, shapes, and colors.

=== Parts ===
* pair of eye wires or rims surrounding and holding the lenses in place
* bridge which connects the two eye wires
* chassis, the combination of the eye wires and the bridge
* top bar or brow bar, a bar just above the bridge providing structural support and/or style enhancement (country/Grandpa style). The addition of a top bar makes a pair of glasses aviator eyeglasses
* pair of brows or caps, plastic or metal caps which fit over the top of the eye wires for style enhancement and to provide additional support for the lenses. The addition of brows makes a pair of glasses browline glasses
* pair of nose pads that allows a comfortable resting of the eye wires on the nose
* pair of pad arms connect the nose pads to the eye wires
* pair of temples (earpieces) on either side of the skull
* pair of temple tips at the ends of the temples
* pair of end pieces connect the eye wires via the hinges to the temples
* pair of frame-front end pieces
* pair of hinges connect the end pieces to the temples, allowing a swivel movement. Spring-loaded flex hinges are a variant that is equipped with a small spring that affords the temples a greater range of movement and does not limit them to the traditional, 90-degree angle.

=== Temple types ===
* Skull temples: bend down behind the ears, follow the contour of the skull and rest evenly against the skull
* Library temples: generally straight and do not bend down behind the ears. Hold the glasses primarily through light pressure against the side of the skull
* Convertible temples: used either as library or skull temples depending on the bent
* Riding bow temples: curve around the ear and extend down to the level of the ear lobe. Used mostly on athletic, children&#x27;s, and industrial safety frames
* Comfort cable temples: similar to the riding bow, but made from a springy cable of coiled metal, sometimes inside a plastic or silicone sleeve. The tightness of the curl can be adjusted along its whole length, allowing the back to fit the wearer&#x27;s ear curve perfectly. Used for physically active wearers, children, and people with high prescriptions (heavy lenses). See the image of 1920s frames above.

=== Materials ===
==== Plastic and polymer ====
* Cellulose acetate
* Optyl, a type of hypoallergenic material made especially for eyeglass frames. It features a type of elasticity that returns the material to its original shape.
* Cellulose propionate, a molded, durable plastic
* 3D-printed plastic using super-fine polyamide powder and Selective laser sintering processes – see Mykita Mylon (The frames can be 3-D printed by Fused Filament Fabrication for pennies of ABS, PLA or nylon)
* Nylon

==== Metal ====
Various metals and alloys may be used to make glasses, such as gold, silver, aluminum, beryllium, stainless steel, titanium, Monel, and nickel titanium.

==== Natural material ====
Natural materials such as wood, bone, ivory, leather and semi-precious or precious stones may also be used.

== Corrective lens shape ==
Corrective lenses can be produced in many different shapes from a circular lens called a lens blank. Lens blanks are cut to fit the shape of the frame that will hold them. Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes. For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions, allowing for many trendy and fashionable shapes. Higher power lenses can distort peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used. However, if the lens is too small, it can drastically reduce the field of view.

Bifocal, trifocal, and progressive lenses generally require a taller lens shape to leave room for the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting myopic prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, panto, rectangular, octagonal, or square. It was not until glasses began to be seen as an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.

== History ==
=== Precursors ===
Scattered evidence exists for use of visual aid devices in Greek and Roman times, most prominently the use of an emerald by Emperor Nero as mentioned by Pliny the Elder.

The use of a convex lens to form an enlarged/magnified image was most likely described in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot; (which survives only in a poor Arabic translation). Ptolemy&#x27;s description of lenses was commented upon and improved by Ibn Sahl (10th century) and most notably by Alhazen (&quot;Book of Optics&quot;, ). Latin translations of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot; and of Alhazen became available in Europe in the 12th century, coinciding with the development of &quot;reading stones&quot;.

There are claims that single lens magnifying glasses were being used in China during the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127).

Robert Grosseteste&#x27;s treatise &quot;De iride&quot; (&quot;On the Rainbow&quot;), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to &quot;read the smallest letters at incredible distances&quot;. A few years later in 1262, Roger Bacon is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses. The development of the first eyeglasses took place in northern Italy in the second half of the 13th century.

Independently of the development of optical lenses, some cultures developed &quot;sunglasses&quot; for eye protection, without any corrective properties. For example, flat panes of smoky quartz were used in 12th-century China, and the Inuit have used snow goggles for eye protection.

=== Invention ===


The earliest recorded comment on the use of lenses for optical purposes was made in 1268 by Roger Bacon.

The first eyeglasses were estimated to have been made in Central Italy, most likely in Pisa or Florence, by about 1290: In a sermon delivered on 23 February 1306, the Dominican friar Giordano da Pisa (–1311) wrote &quot;It is not yet twenty years since there was found the art of making eyeglasses, which make for good vision ... And it is so short a time that this new art, never before extant, was discovered. ... I saw the one who first discovered and practiced it, and I talked to him.&quot;

Giordano&#x27;s colleague Friar Alessandro della Spina of Pisa (d. 1313) was soon making eyeglasses. The &quot;Ancient Chronicle of the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine in Pisa&quot; records: &quot;Eyeglasses, having first been made by someone else, who was unwilling to share them, he [Spina] made them and shared them with everyone with a cheerful and willing heart.&quot; Venice quickly became an important center of manufacture, especially due to using the high-quality glass made at Murano. By 1301, there were guild regulations in Venice governing the sale of eyeglasses and a separate guild of Venetian spectacle makers was formed in 1320. In the fourteenth century, they were very common objects: Francesco Petrarca says in one of his letters that, until he was 60, he did not need glasses, and Franco Sacchetti mentions them often in his &quot;Trecentonovelle&quot;.

The earliest pictorial evidence for the use of eyeglasses is Tommaso da Modena&#x27;s 1352 portrait of the cardinal Hugh de Saint-Cher reading in a scriptorium. Another early example would be a depiction of eyeglasses found north of the Alps in an altarpiece of the church of Bad Wildungen, Germany, in 1403. These early glasses had convex lenses that could correct both hyperopia (farsightedness), and the presbyopia that commonly develops as a symptom of aging. Although concave lenses for myopia (near-sightedness) had made their first appearance in the mid-15th century, it was not until 1604 that Johannes Kepler published the first correct explanation as to why convex and concave lenses could correct presbyopia and myopia.

Early frames for glasses consisted of two magnifying glasses riveted together by the handles so that they could grip the nose. These are referred to as &quot;rivet spectacles&quot;. The earliest surviving examples were found under the floorboards at Kloster Wienhausen, a convent near Celle in Germany; they have been dated to &quot;circa&quot; 1400.

The world&#x27;s first specialist shop for spectacles—what we might regard today as an optician—opened in Strasbourg (then Holy Roman Empire, now France) in 1466.

==== Other claims ====
The 17th-century claim by Francesco Redi that Salvino degli Armati of Florence invented eyeglasses in the 13th century has been exposed as erroneous.

Marco Polo is mistakenly claimed to have encountered eyeglasses during his travels in China in the 13th century. However, no such evidence appears in his accounts. Indeed, the earliest mentions of eyeglasses in China occur in the 15th century and those Chinese sources state that eyeglasses were imported.

In 1907, Professor Berthold Laufer speculated, in his history of glasses, that for glasses to be mentioned in the literature of China and Europe at approximately the same time it was probable that they were not invented independently, and after ruling out the Turks, proposed India as a location. However, Joseph Needham speculated that the mention of glasses in the Chinese manuscript Laufer used &quot;in part&quot; to credit the prior invention of them in Asia did not exist in older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty.

In 1971, Rishi Agarwal, in an article in the &quot;British Journal of Ophthalmology&quot;, states that Vyasatirtha was observed in possession of a pair of glasses in the 1520s, he argues that it &quot;is, therefore, most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did Hindu mathematics and the ophthalmological works of the ancient Hindu surgeon Sushruta&quot;, but all dates are given well after the existence of eyeglasses in Italy was established, including significant shipments of eyeglasses from Italy to the Middle East, with one shipment as large as 24,000 glasses, as well as a spectacles dispensary in Strasbourg in 1466.

=== Later developments ===
The American scientist Benjamin Franklin, who had both myopia and presbyopia, invented bifocals. Historians have from time to time produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between George Whatley and John Fenno, editor of &quot;The Gazette of the United States&quot;, suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought. The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the British astronomer George Airy in 1825.

Over time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (&quot;pince-nez&quot;). Girolamo Savonarola suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer&#x27;s head, this in turn secured by the weight of a hat. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed sometime before 1727, possibly by the British optician Edward Scarlett. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as &quot;scissors-glasses&quot; and lorgnettes were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.

In the early 20th century, Moritz von Rohr and Zeiss (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld) developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, Joshua Silver designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by using a built-in syringe to pump a silicone solution into a flexible lens.

Despite the popularity of contact lenses and laser corrective eye surgery, glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special memory metal alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offer dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, lightweight materials such as titanium alloys, which were not available in earlier times.

===In fashion===

In the 1930s, &quot;spectacles&quot; were described as &quot;medical appliances&quot;. Wearing spectacles was sometimes considered socially humiliating. In the 1970s, fashionable glasses started to become available through manufacturers, and governments also recognized the demand for stylized eyewear.

Graham Pullin describes how devices for disability, like glasses, have traditionally been designed to camouflage against the skin and restore ability without being visible. In the past, design for disability has &quot;been less about projecting a positive image as about trying not to project an image at all&quot;. Pullin uses the example of spectacles, traditionally categorized as a medical device for &quot;patients&quot;, and outlines how they are now described as eyewear: a fashionable accessory. Much like other fashion designs and accessories, eyewear is created by designers, has reputable labels, and comes in collections, by season and designer. In recent years, it has become more common for consumers to purchase eyewear with non-prescription lenses as a fashion accessory.

==Society and culture==
===Market===
====United States====
The market for spectacles has been characterized as having highly inelastic demand. Advertising restrictions in the United States, for example, have correlated with higher prices, suggesting that adverts make the spectacles market more price-competitive. It has also been claimed to be monopolistically competitive, as in the case of Luxottica.

There are claims that insufficiently free market competition inflates the prices of frames, which cost an average of $25–$50 U.S. to make, to an average retail price of $300 in the United States. This claim is disputed by some in the industry.

The United States also prohibits the sale of glasses unless the user has a recent prescription from an optometrist or ophthalmologist, whereas in most of the world, glasses and contact lenses can be bought without needing to get a new eye exam first. This means that Americans who lose or break their glasses may be unable to see well until they can get, and pay for, an appointment with an optometrist. In most of the world, someone who has lost their glasses merely goes to the nearest store selling glasses and buys a replacement over the counter.

=== Redistribution ===
Some organizations like Lions Clubs International, Unite For Sight, ReSpectacle, and New Eyes for the Needy provide a way to donate glasses and sunglasses to people on low incomes or no income. Unite For Sight has redistributed more than 200,000 pairs.

=== Fashion ===
Many people require glasses for the reasons listed above. There are many shapes, colors, and materials that can be used when designing frames and lenses that can be utilized in various combinations. Oftentimes, the selection of a frame is made based on how it will affect the appearance of the wearer. Some people with good natural eyesight like to wear eyeglasses as a style accessory. In Japan, some companies ban women from wearing glasses.

==== Personal image ====
For most of their history, eyeglasses were seen as unfashionable, and carried several potentially negative connotations: wearing glasses caused individuals to be stigmatized and stereotyped as pious clergymen, as those in religious vocation were the most likely to be literate and therefore the most likely to need reading glasses, elderly, or physically weak and passive. The stigma began to fall away in the U.S. in the early 1900s when the popular Theodore Roosevelt was regularly photographed wearing eyeglasses, and in the 1910s when popular comedian Harold Lloyd wore a pair of horn-rimmed glasses as the &quot;Glasses&quot; character in his films.

In the United Kingdom, wearing glasses was characterized in the nineteenth century as &quot;a sure sign of the weakling and the mollycoddle&quot;, according to Neville Cardus, writing in 1928. &quot;Tim&quot; Killick was the first professional cricketer to play while wearing glasses &quot;continuously&quot;, after his vision deteriorated in 1897. &quot;With their aid he placed himself in the forefront among English professionals of all-round abilities.&quot; The American tenor Jan Peerce, plagued with poor eyesight, credited comedian Steve Allen for normalizing and even popularizing the wearing of eyeglasses in front of live television and stage audiences; prior to this, performers who read on early television were expected to squint or use contact lenses.

Since then, eyeglasses have become an acceptable fashion item and often act as a key component in individuals&#x27; personal image. Musicians Buddy Holly and John Lennon became synonymous with the styles of eye-glasses they wore to the point that thick, black horn-rimmed glasses are often called &quot;Buddy Holly glasses&quot; and perfectly round metal eyeglass frames called &quot;John Lennon glasses&quot; (or, more recently, &quot;Harry Potter glasses&quot;). British comedic actor Eric Sykes was known in the United Kingdom for wearing thick, square, horn-rimmed glasses, which were in fact a sophisticated hearing aid that alleviated his deafness by allowing him to &quot;hear&quot; vibrations. Some celebrities have become so associated with their eyeglasses that they continued to wear them even after taking other measures against vision problems: U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater and comedian Drew Carey continued to wear non-prescription glasses after being fitted for contacts and getting laser eye surgery, respectively.

Other celebrities have used glasses to differentiate themselves from the characters they play, such as Anne Kirkbride, who wore oversized 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as Deirdre Barlow in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;; and Masaharu Morimoto, who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a chef from his stage persona as Iron Chef Japanese. In 2012, some NBA players wore lensless glasses with thick plastic frames like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to actor Jaleel White&#x27;s infamous styling as TV character Steve Urkel.

In superhero fiction, eyeglasses have become a standard component of various heroes&#x27; disguises as masks, allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor when they are not in their superhero personae: Superman is well known for wearing 1950s-style horn-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent, while Wonder Woman wears either round, Harold Lloyd-style glasses or 1970s-style bug-eye glasses as Diana Prince. An example of the halo effect is seen in the stereotype that those who wear glasses are intelligent. This belief can have positive consequences for people who wear glasses, for example in elections. Studies show that wearing glasses increases politicians&#x27; electoral success, at least in Western cultures.

==== Styles ====
In the 20th century, eyeglasses came to be considered a component of fashion; as such, various different styles have come in and out of popularity. Most are still in regular use, albeit with varying degrees of frequency.

<text>Contact lenses, or simply contacts, are thin lenses placed directly on the surface of the eyes. Contact lenses are ocular prosthetic devices used by over 150 million people worldwide, and they can be worn to correct vision or for cosmetic or therapeutic reasons. In 2010, the worldwide market for contact lenses was estimated at $6.1 billion, while the US soft lens market was estimated at $2.1 billion. Multiple analysts estimated that the global market for contact lenses would reach $11.7 billion by 2015. the average age of contact lens wearers globally was 31 years old, and two-thirds of wearers were female.

People choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and cosmetics are main motivating factors for people who want to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance or color of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation, etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eye wear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.

==History==

===Origins and first functional prototypes===
Leonardo da Vinci is frequently credited with introducing the idea of contact lenses in his 1508 &quot;Codex of the eye, Manual D&quot;, wherein he described a method of directly altering corneal power by either submerging the head in a bowl of water or wearing a water-filled glass hemisphere over the eye. Neither idea was practically implementable in da Vinci&#x27;s time. He did not suggest his idea be used for correcting vision; he was more interested in exploring mechanisms of accommodation.

Descartes proposed a device for correcting vision consisting of a liquid-filled glass tube capped with a lens. However, the idea was impracticable, since the device was to be placed in direct contact with the cornea and thus would have made blinking impossible.

In 1801, Thomas Young fashioned a pair of basic contact lenses based on Descartes&#x27; model. He used wax to affix water-filled lenses to his eyes, neutralizing their refractive power, which he corrected with another pair of lenses.

John Herschel, in a footnote to the 1845 edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia Metropolitana&quot;, posed two ideas for the visual correction: the first &quot;a spherical capsule of glass filled with animal jelly&quot;, the second &quot;a mould of the cornea&quot; that could be impressed on &quot;some sort of transparent medium&quot;. Though Herschel reportedly never tested these ideas, they were later advanced by independent inventors, including Hungarian physician Joseph Dallos, who perfected a method of making molds from living eyes. This enabled the manufacture of lenses that, for the first time, conformed to the actual shape of the eye.

Although Louis J. Girard invented a scleral contact lens in 1887, it was German ophthalmologist Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick who in 1888 fabricated the first successful afocal scleral contact lens. Approximately in diameter, the heavy blown-glass shells rested on the less sensitive rim of tissue surrounding the cornea and floated on a dextrose solution. He experimented with fitting the lenses initially on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers, publishing his work, &quot;Contactbrille&quot;, in the March 1888 edition of &quot;Archiv für Augenheilkunde&quot;. Large and unwieldy, Fick&#x27;s lens could be worn only for a couple of hours at a time. August Müller of Kiel, Germany, corrected his own severe myopia with a more convenient blown-glass scleral contact lens of his own manufacture in 1888.

The development of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) in the 1930s paved the way for the manufacture of plastic scleral lenses. In 1936, optometrist William Feinbloom introduced a hybrid lens composed of glass and plastic, and in 1937 it was reported that some 3,000 Americans were already wearing contact lenses. In 1939, Hungarian ophthalmologist Dr.István Györffy produced the first fully plastic contact lens. The following year, German optometrist Heinrich Wöhlk produced his own version of plastic lenses based on experiments performed during the 1930s.

===Corneal and rigid lenses (1949–1960s)===

In 1949, the first &quot;corneal&quot; lenses were developed. These were much smaller than the original scleral lenses, as they sat only on the cornea rather than across all of the visible ocular surface and could be worn up to 16 hours a day. PMMA corneal lenses became the first contact lenses to have mass appeal through the 1960s, as lens designs became more sophisticated with improving manufacturing technology. On October 18, 1964, in a television studio in Washington, D.C., Lyndon Baines Johnson became the first President in the history of the United States to appear in public wearing contact lenses, under the supervision of Dr. Alan Isen, who developed the first commercially viable soft-contact lenses in the United States.

Early corneal lenses of the 1950s and 1960s were relatively expensive and fragile, resulting in the development of a market for contact lens insurance. Replacement Lens Insurance, Inc. (now known as RLI Corp.) phased out its original flagship product in 1994 after contact lenses became more affordable and easier to replace.

===Gas permeable and soft lenses (1959–present)===

One of the major disadvantages of PMMA lenses is that they allow no oxygen to get through to the conjunctiva and cornea, causing a number of adverse and potentially serious clinical effects. By the end of the 1970s and through the 1980s and 1990s, a range of oxygen-permeable but rigid materials were developed to overcome this problem. Chemist Norman Gaylord played a prominent role in the development of these new oxygen-permeable contact lenses. Collectively, these polymers are referred to as &quot;rigid gas permeable&quot; or RGP materials or lenses. Though all the above contact lens types—sclerals, PMMAs and RGPs—could be correctly referred to as &quot;rigid&quot; or &quot;hard&quot;, the latter term is now used for the original PMMAs, which are still occasionally fitted and worn, whereas &quot;rigid&quot; is a generic term for all these lens types; thus, hard lenses (PMMAs) are a subset of rigid contact lenses. Occasionally, the term &quot;gas permeable&quot; is used to describe RGPs, which is somewhat misleading as soft contact lenses are also gas permeable in that they allow oxygen to get through to the ocular surface.

The principal breakthrough in soft lenses was made by Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím, who published their work &quot;Hydrophilic gels for biological use&quot; in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in 1959. In 1965, National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch &amp; Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States. The Czech scientists&#x27; work led to the launch of the first hydrogel contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying the ingredients. In 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.

In 1998, the first silicone hydrogel contact lenses were released by Ciba Vision in Mexico. These new materials encapsulated the benefits of silicone which has extremely high oxygen permeability—with the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels that had been used for the previous 30 years. These contact lenses were initially advocated primarily for extended (overnight) wear, although more recently, daily (no overnight) wear silicone hydrogels have been launched.

In a slightly modified molecule, a polar group is added without changing the structure of the silicone hydrogel. This is referred to as the Tanaka monomer because it was invented and patented by of Co. of Japan in 1979. Second-generation silicone hydrogels, such as galyfilcon A (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) and senofilcon A (Acuvue Oasys, Vistakon), use the Tanaka monomer. Vistakon improved the Tanaka monomer even further and added other molecules, which serve as an internal wetting agent.

Comfilcon A (Biofinity, CooperVision) was the first third-generation polymer. Its patent claims that the material uses two siloxy macromers of diverse sizes that, when used in combination, produce very high oxygen permeability for a given water content. Enfilcon A (Avaira, CooperVision) is another third-generation material that is naturally wet; its water content is 46%.

==Types==
Contact lenses are classified in diverse ways, namely, by their primary function, material, wear schedule (how long a lens can be worn), and replacement schedule (how long before a lens needs to be discarded).

===Functions===

====Correction of refractive error====
Corrective contact lenses are designed to improve vision, most commonly by correcting refractive error. This is done by directly focusing light so it enters the eye with the proper power for clear vision.

A spherical contact lens bends light evenly in every direction (horizontally, vertically, etc.). They are typically used to correct myopia and hypermetropia.

There are two ways that contact lenses can correct astigmatism. One way is with toric soft lenses that work essentially the same way as eyeglasses with cylindrical correction; a toric lens has a different focusing power horizontally than vertically, and as a result can correct for astigmatism. Another way is by using a rigid gas permeable lens; since most astigmatism is caused by the shape of the cornea, rigid lenses can improve vision because the front surface of the optical system is the perfectly spherical lens. Both approaches have advantages and drawbacks. Toric lenses must have the proper orientation to correct for astigmatism, so such lenses must have additional design characteristics to prevent them from rotating out of alignment. This can be done by weighting the bottom of the lens or by using other physical characteristics to rotate the lens back into position, but these mechanisms rarely work perfectly, so some misalignment is common and results in somewhat imperfect correction, and blurring of sight after blinking rotates the lens. Toric soft lenses have all the advantages of soft lenses in general, which are low initial cost, ease of fitting, and minimal adjustment period. Rigid gas permeable lenses usually provide superior optical correction but have become less popular relative to soft lenses due to higher initial costs, longer initial adjustment period, and more involved fitting.

====Correction of presbyopia====
Correction of presbyopia (a need for a reading prescription different from the prescription needed for distance) presents an additional challenge in the fitting of contact lenses. Two main strategies exist: multifocal lenses and monovision.

Multifocal contact lenses (e.g. bifocals or progressives) are comparable to spectacles with bifocals or progressive lenses because they have multiple focal points. Multifocal contact lenses are typically designed for constant viewing through the center of the lens, but some designs do incorporate a shift in lens position to view through the reading power (similar to bifocal glasses).

Monovision is the use of single-vision lenses (one focal point per lens) to focus an eye (typically the dominant one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.

Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses.

====Other types of vision correction====
For those with certain color deficiencies, a red-tinted &quot;X-Chrom&quot; contact lens may be used. Although such a lens does not restore normal color vision, it allows some color-blind people to distinguish colors better. Red-filtering contact lenses can also be an option for extreme light sensitivity in some visual deficiencies such as achromatopsia.

ChromaGen contact lenses have been used and shown to have some limitations with vision at night although otherwise producing significant improvements in color vision. An earlier study showed very significant improvements in color vision and patient satisfaction.

Later work that used these ChromaGen lenses with people with dyslexia in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed highly significant improvements in reading ability over reading without the lenses. This system has been granted FDA approval for use in the United States.

Magnification is another area being researched for future contact lens applications. Embedding of telescopic lenses and electronic components suggests that future uses of contact lenses may become extremely diverse.

====Cosmetic contact lenses====
A cosmetic contact lens is designed to change the appearance of the eye. These lenses may also correct refractive error. Although many brands of contact lenses are lightly tinted to make them easier to handle, cosmetic lenses worn to change eye color are far less common, accounting for only 3% of contact lens fits in 2004.

In the United States, the FDA labels non-corrective cosmetic contact lenses as &quot;decorative contact lenses&quot;. Like any contact lens, cosmetic lenses carry risks of mild to serious complications, including ocular redness, irritation and infection.

Due to their medical nature, colored contact lenses, similar to regular ones, are illegal to purchase in the United States without a valid prescription. Those with perfect vision can buy color contacts for cosmetic reasons, but they still need their eyes to be measured for a &quot;plano&quot; prescription, meaning one with zero vision correction. This is for safety reasons so the lenses will fit the eye without causing irritation or redness.

Some colored contact lenses completely cover the iris, thus dramatically changing eye color. Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting its natural color. A new trend in Japan, South Korea and China is the circle contact lens, which extend the appearance of the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is an appearance of a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls&#x27; eyes.

Cosmetic lenses can have more direct medical applications. For example, some contact lenses can restore the appearance and, to some extent the function, of a damaged or missing iris.

====Therapeutic scleral lenses====
A scleral lens is a large, firm, transparent, oxygen-permeable contact lens that rests on the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses may be used to improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people with disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (anesthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.

====Therapeutic soft lenses====
Soft lenses are often used in the treatment and management of non-refractive disorders of the eye. A bandage contact lens allows the patient to see while protecting an injured or diseased cornea from the constant rubbing of blinking eyelids, thereby allowing it to heal. They are used in the treatment of conditions including bullous keratopathy, dry eyes, corneal abrasions and erosion, keratitis, corneal edema, descemetocele, corneal ectasia, Mooren&#x27;s ulcer, anterior corneal dystrophy, and neurotrophic keratoconjunctivitis. Contact lenses that deliver drugs to the eye have also been developed.

===Materials===
====Rigid lenses====
Glass lenses were never comfortable enough to gain widespread popularity. The first lenses to do so were those made from polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA or Perspex/Plexiglas), now commonly referred to as &quot;hard&quot; lenses. Their main disadvantage is they do not allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea, which can cause a number of adverse, and often serious, clinical events. Starting in the late 1970s, improved rigid materials which were oxygen-permeable were developed. Contact lenses made from these materials are called rigid gas permeable lenses (RGPs).

A rigid lens is able to cover the natural shape of the cornea with a new refracting surface. This means that a spherical rigid contact lens can correct corneal astigmatism. Rigid lenses can also be made as a front-toric, back-toric, or bitoric. Rigid lenses can also correct corneas with irregular geometries, such as those with keratoconus or post surgical ectasias. In most cases, patients with keratoconus see better through rigid lenses than through glasses. Rigid lenses are more chemically inert, allowing them to be worn in more challenging environments where chemical inertia is important compared to soft lenses.

====Soft lenses====

Soft lenses are more flexible than rigid lenses and can be gently rolled or folded without damaging the lens. While rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before comfort is achieved, new soft lens wearers typically report lens awareness rather than pain or discomfort.

Hydrogel lenses rely on their water content to transmit oxygen through the lens to the cornea. As a result, higher water content lenses allowed more oxygen to the cornea. In 1998, silicone hydrogel, or Si-hy lenses became available. These materials have both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and clinical performance of the conventional hydrogels. Because silicone allows more oxygen permeability than water, oxygen permeability of silicone hydrogels is not tied to the lenses&#x27; water content. Lenses have now been developed with so much oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.

Current brands of soft lenses are either traditional hydrogel or silicone hydrogel. Because of drastic differences in oxygen permeability, replacement schedule, and other design characteristics, it is very important to follow the instructions of the eye care professional prescribing the lenses. When comparing traditional hydrogel soft lens contacts with silicone hydrogel versions, there is no clear evidence to recommend a superior lens.

Disadvantages of silicone hydrogels are that they are slightly stiffer and the lens surface can be hydrophobic, thus less &quot;wettable&quot; – factors that can influence comfort of lens use. New manufacturing techniques and changes to multipurpose solutions have minimized these effects. Those new techniques are often broken down into 3 generations:

* 1st generation (plasma coating): A surface modification process called plasma coating alters the lens surface&#x27;s hydrophobic nature;
* 2nd generation (wetting agents): Another technique incorporates internal rewetting agents to make the lens surface hydrophilic;
* 3rd generation (inherently wettable): A third process uses longer backbone polymer chains that results in less cross linking and increased wetting without surface alterations or additive agents.

====Hybrid====
A small number of hybrid lenses exist. Typically, these contact lenses consist of a rigid center and a soft &quot;skirt&quot;. A similar technique is the &quot;piggybacking&quot; of a smaller, rigid lens on the surface of a larger, soft lens. These techniques are often chosen to give the vision correction benefits of a rigid lens and the comfort of a soft lens.

===Wear schedule===
A &quot;daily wear&quot; (DW) contact lens is designed to be worn for one day and removed before sleeping. An &quot;extended wear&quot; (EW) contact lens is designed for continuous overnight wear, typically for up to 6 consecutive nights. Newer materials, such as silicone hydrogels, allow for even longer wear periods of up to 30 consecutive nights; these longer-wear lenses are often referred to as &quot;continuous wear&quot; (CW). EW and CW contact lenses can be worn overnight because of their high oxygen permeability. While awake, the eyes are mostly open, allowing oxygen from the air to dissolve into the tears and pass through the lens to the cornea. While asleep, oxygen is supplied from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid. A lens hindering passage of oxygen to the cornea causes corneal hypoxia which can result in serious complications, such as corneal ulcer that, if left untreated, can permanently decrease vision. EW and CW contact lenses typically allow for a transfer of 5–6 times more oxygen than conventional softs, allowing the cornea to remain healthy, even with closed eyelids.

Wearing lenses designed for daily wear overnight has an increased risk for corneal infections, corneal ulcers and corneal neovascularization—this latter condition, once it sets in, cannot be reversed and will eventually spoil vision acuity through diminishing corneal transparency. The most common complication of extended wear is giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), sometimes associated with a poorly fitting contact lens.

===Replacement schedule===
Contact lenses are often categorized by their replacement schedule. Single use lenses (called 1-day or daily disposables) are discarded after one use. Because they do not have to stand up to the wear and tear of repeated uses, these lenses can be made thinner and lighter, greatly improving their comfort. Lenses replaced frequently gather fewer deposits of allergens and germs, making these lenses preferable for patients with ocular allergies or for those who are prone to infection. Single-use lenses are also useful for people who wear contact lenses infrequently, or when losing a lens is likely or not easily replaced (such as when on vacation). They are also considered useful for children because cleaning or disinfecting is not needed, leading to improved compliance.

Other disposable contact lenses are designed for replacement every two or four weeks. Quarterly or annual lenses, which used to be very common, are now much less so. Rigid gas permeable lenses are very durable and may last for several years without the need for replacement. PMMA hards were very durable and were commonly worn for 5 to 10 years but had several drawbacks.

Lenses with different replacement schedules can be made of the same material. Although the materials are alike, differences in the manufacturing processes determine if the resulting lens will be a &quot;daily disposable&quot; or one recommended for two- or four-week replacement. However, sometimes manufacturers use absolutely identical lenses and just repackage them with different labels.

==Manufacturing==

Typically, soft contact lenses are mass-produced, while rigids are custom-made to exact specifications for the individual patient.
* Spin-cast lenses – A soft lens manufactured by whirling liquid silicone in a revolving mold at high speed.
* Diamond turning – This type is cut and polished on a CNC lathe. The lens starts out as a cylindrical disk held in the jaws of the lathe that is equipped with an industrial-grade diamond as the cutting tool. The CNC lathe may turn at nearly 6000 RPM as the cutter removes the desired amount of material from the inside of the lens. The concave (inner) surface of the lens is then polished with some fine abrasive paste, oil, and a small polyester cotton ball turned at high speeds. To hold the delicate lens in reverse manner, wax is used as an adhesive. The lens&#x27; convex (outer) surface is thus cut and polished by the same process. This method can be used to shape rigid as well as soft lenses. In the case of softs, the lens is cut from a dehydrated polymer that is rigid until water is reintroduced.
* Molded – Molding is used to manufacture some brands of soft contact lenses. Rotating molds are used and the molten material is added and shaped by centripetal forces. Injection molding and computer control are also used to create nearly perfect lenses. The lens is kept moist throughout the entire molding process and is never dried and rehydrated.

==Prescriptions==
The parameters specified in a contact lens prescription may include:

* Brand name
* Material
* Base curve radius (BC, BCR)
* Diameter (D, OAD)
* Optical power in diopters (dpt)
* Center thickness (CT)

Prescriptions for contact lenses and glasses may be similar but are not interchangeable. Prescribing of contact lenses is usually restricted to various combinations of ophthalmologists, optometrists and opticians. An eye examination is needed to determine an individual&#x27;s suitability for contact lens wear. This typically includes a refraction to determine the proper power of the lens and an assessment of the health of the eye&#x27;s anterior segment. Many eye diseases inhibit contact lens wear, such as active infections, allergies, and dry eye. Keratometry is especially important in the fitting of rigid lenses.

===United States===
Contact lenses are prescribed by ophthalmologists, optometrists, or specially licensed opticians under the supervision of an eye doctor. They are typically ordered at the same office that conducts the eye exam and fitting. The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act guarantees consumers a copy of their contact lens prescription, allowing them to obtain lenses at the provider of their choice.

==Usage==
Before touching the contact lens or the eye, it is important to wash hands thoroughly with soap and rinse well. Soaps containing moisturizers or allergens should be avoided as these can cause eye irritation. Drying of hands using towels or tissues before handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation upon insertion. Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, before handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, before opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A &#x27;gritty&#x27; or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation upon insertion.

Care should be taken to ensure the soft lens is not inserted inside-out. The edge of a lens turned inside out has a different appearance, especially when the lens is slightly folded. Insertion of an inside-out lens for a brief time (less than one minute) should not cause any damage to the eye. Some brands of lenses have markings on the rim that make it easier to tell the front of the lens apart from the back.

===Insertion===
Contact lenses are typically inserted into the eye by placing them on the pad of the index or middle finger with the concave side upward and then using that finger to place the lens on the eye. Rigid lenses should be placed directly on the cornea. Soft lenses may be placed on the sclera (white of the eye) and then slid into place. Another finger of the same hand, or a finger of the other hand, is used to keep the eye wide open. Alternatively, the user may close their eyes and then look towards their nose, sliding the lens into place over the cornea. Problems may arise if the lens folds, turns inside-out, slides off the finger prematurely, or adheres more tightly to the finger than the eye surface. A drop of solution may help the lens adhere to the eye.

When the lens first contacts the eye, it should be comfortable. A brief period of irritation may occur, caused by a difference in pH and/or salinity between that of the lens solution and the tear. This discomfort fades quickly as the solution drains away and is replaced by the natural tears. However, if irritation persists, the cause could be a dirty, damaged, or inside-out lens. Removing and inspecting it for damage and proper orientation, and re-cleaning if necessary, should correct the problem. If discomfort continues, the lens should not be worn. In some cases, taking a break from lens wear for a day may correct the problem. In case of severe discomfort, or if it does not resolve by the next day, the person should be seen as soon as possible by an eye doctor to rule out potentially serious complications.

===Removal===
Removing contact lenses incorrectly can result in damage to the lens and injury to the eye, so certain precautions must be taken. Rigid contact lenses can best be removed by pulling the eyelid tight and then blinking, whereupon the lens drops out. With one finger on the outer corner of the eyelids, or lateral canthus, the person stretches the eyelids towards the ear; the increased tension of the eyelid margins against the edge of lens allows the blink to break the capillary action that adheres the lens to the eye. The other hand is typically cupped underneath the eye to catch the lens as it drops out. For soft lenses, which have a stronger adherence to the eye surface, this technique is less suitable.

A soft contact lens may be removed by pinching the edge between the thumb and index finger. Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It is also possible to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball to get it to fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.

There are also small tools specifically for removing lenses. Usually made of flexible plastic, they resemble small tweezers, or plungers that suction onto the front of the lens. Typically, these tools are used only with rigid lenses. Extreme care must be exercised when using mechanical tools or fingernails to insert or remove contact lenses.

===Care===
Lens care varies depending on material and wear schedule. Daily disposables are discarded after a single use and thus require no cleaning. Other lenses need regular cleaning and disinfecting to prevent surface coating and infections.

There are many ways to clean and care for contact lenses, typically called care systems or lens solutions:

;Multipurpose solutions
:The main attraction of multipurpose solutions is that the same solution can clean, rinse, disinfect and store lenses. Some multipurpose solutions also contain ingredients that improve the surface wettability and comfort of silicone hydrogel lenses. Studies showed that multipurpose solutions are ineffective against &quot;Acanthamoebae&quot;. There is preliminary research on creating a new multipurpose solution that kills amoeba.

;Hydrogen peroxide contact solutions
:Hydrogen peroxide can be used to disinfect contact lenses. Care should be taken not to get hydrogen peroxide in the eye because it is very painful and irritating. With &quot;two-step&quot; products, the hydrogen peroxide must be rinsed away with saline before the lenses may be worn. &quot;One-step&quot; systems allow the hydrogen peroxide to react completely, becoming pure water. Thus &quot;one-step&quot; hydrogen peroxide systems do not require the lenses to be rinsed before insertion, provided the solution has been given enough time to react.
:An exposure time of 2-3 hours to 3% (non neutralized solution) is sufficient to kill bacteria, HIV, fungi, and &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;. This can be achieved by using a &quot;two-step&quot; product or a &quot;one-step&quot; tablet system if the catalytic tablet is not added before 2-3 hours. However, the &quot;one-step&quot; catalytic disk systems are not effective against &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; due to insufficient exposure time.
;Enzymatic cleaner
:Used for cleaning protein deposits off lenses, usually weekly, if the daily cleaner is not sufficient. Typically, this cleaner is in tablet form.
;Ultraviolet, vibration, or ultrasonic devices
:These devices intend to disinfect and clean contact lenses. The lenses are inserted inside the portable device (running on batteries and/or plug-in) for 2 to 6 minutes during which both the microorganisms and protein build-up are supposed to be cleaned. However these devices can not be used to replace the manual rub and rinse method because vibration and ultrasound can not create relative motion between contact lens and solution, which is required for proper cleaning of the lens. These devices are not usually available in optic retailers but are in other stores.

====Rub and rinse method====
Contact lenses can be mechanically cleaned of more substantial protein, lipid and debris build up by rubbing them between the clean pad of a finger and the palm of a hand, using a small amount of cleaning fluid as a lubricant; and by rinsing thereafter. This &quot;rub and rinse&quot; method is thought to be the most effective method for multipurpose solutions, and is the method indicated by the American Academy of Ophthalmology regardless of cleaning solution used. In 2010, the FDA recommended that manufacturers removed the &quot;no rub&quot; from product labeling, &quot;because ″rub-and-rinse″ regimens help prevent microbial adhesion to the contact lens, help prevent formation of biofilms, and generally reduce the microbial load on the lens and the lens case.&quot;

====Physical rubbing devices====
This type of devices mimic digital rubbing. The lenses are sandwiched by silicone parts inside the portable device. The device applies a gentle yet high speed rubbing action on the lens surface and remove debris.

;Saline solution
:Sterile saline is used for rinsing the lens after cleaning and preparing it for insertion. Saline solutions do not disinfect, so it must be used in conjunction with some type of disinfection system. One advantage to saline is that it cannot cause an allergic response, so it is well suited for individuals with sensitive eyes or strong allergies.
;Daily cleaner
:Used to clean lenses on a daily basis. A few drops of cleaner are applied to the lens while it rests in the palm of the hand; the lens is rubbed for about 20 seconds with a clean fingertip (depending on the product) on each side. Lens must then be rinsed. This system is commonly used to care for rigid lenses.

Water is not recommended for cleaning contact lenses. Insufficiently chlorinated tap water can lead to lens contamination, particularly by Acanthamoeba. On the other hand, sterile water will not kill any contaminants that get in from the environment.

Aside from cleaning the contact lenses, contact lens case should also be kept clean and be replaced at minimum every 3 months.

Contact lens solutions often contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride and benzyl alcohol. Preservative-free products usually have shorter shelf lives, but are better suited for individuals with an allergy or sensitivity to a preservative. In the past, thiomersal was used as a preservative. In 1989, thiomersal was responsible for about 10% of problems related to contact lenses. As a result, most products no longer contain thiomersal.

==Complications==

Contact lenses are generally safe as long as they are used correctly. Complications from contact lens wear affect roughly 5% of wearers yearly. Factors leading to eye damage varies, and improper use of a contact lens may affect the eyelid, the conjunctiva, and, most of all, the whole structure of the cornea. Poor lens care may lead to infections by various microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and the amoeba &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; (&quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; keratitis).

Many complications arise when contact lenses are worn not as prescribed (improper wear schedule or lens replacement). Sleeping in lenses not designed or approved for extended wear is a common cause of complications. Many people go too long before replacing their contacts, wearing lenses designed for 1, 14, or 30 days of wear for multiple months or years. While this does save on the cost of lenses, it risks permanent damage to the eye and even loss of sight.

For non silicone-hydrogel lenses, one of the major factors that causes complications is that the contact lens is an oxygen barrier. The cornea needs a constant supply of oxygen to remain completely transparent and function as it should; it normally gets that oxygen from the surrounding air while awake, and from the blood vessels in the back of the eyelid while asleep. The most prominent risks associated with long-term, chronic low oxygen to the cornea include corneal neovascularization, increased epithelial permeability, bacterial adherence, microcysts, corneal edema, endothelial polymegethism, dry eye and potential increase in myopia. Much of the research into soft and rigid contact lens materials has centered on improving oxygen transmission through the lens.

Silicone-hydrogel lenses available today have effectively eliminated hypoxia for most patients.

Mishandling of contact lenses can also cause problems. Corneal abrasions can increase the chances of infection. When combined with improper cleaning and disinfection of the lens, a risk of infection further increases. Decreased corneal sensitivity after extended contact lens wear may cause a patient to miss some of the earliest symptoms of such complications.

The way contact lenses interact with the natural tear layer is a major factor in determining lens comfort and visual clarity. People with dry eyes are particularly vulnerable to discomfort and episodes of brief blurry vision. Proper lens selection can minimize these effects.

Long-term wear (over five years) of contact lenses may &quot;decrease the entire corneal thickness and increase the corneal curvature and surface irregularity.&quot; Long-term wear of rigid contacts is associated with decreased corneal keratocyte density and increased number of epithelial Langerhans cells.

All contact lenses sold in the United States are studied and approved as safe by the FDA when specific handling and care procedures, wear schedules, and replacement schedules are followed.

==Current research==
Contact lens sensors to monitor the ocular temperature have been demonstrated. Monitoring intraocular pressure with contact lens sensors is another area of contact lens research.

A large segment of current contact lens research is directed towards the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from contact lens contamination and colonization by foreign organisms. Clinicians tend to agree that the most significant complication of contact lens wear is microbial keratitis and that the most predominant microbial pathogen is &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. Other organisms are also major causative factors in bacterial keratitis associated with contact lens wear, although their prevalence varies across different locations. These include both the &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species (&quot;aureus&quot; and &quot;epidermidis&quot;) and the &quot;Streptococcus&quot; species, among others. Microbial keratitis is a serious focal point of current research due to its potentially devastating effect on the eye, including severe vision loss.

One specific research topic of interest is how microbes such as &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; invade the eye and cause infection. Although the pathogenesis of microbial keratitis is not well understood, many different factors have been investigated. One group of researchers showed that corneal hypoxia exacerbated &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; binding to the corneal epithelium, internalization of the microbes, and induction of the inflammatory response. One way to alleviate hypoxia is to increase the amount of oxygen transmitted to the cornea. Although silicone-hydrogel lenses almost eliminate hypoxia in patients due to their very high levels of oxygen transmissibility, they also seem to provide a more efficient platform for bacterial contamination and corneal infiltration than other conventional hydrogel soft contact lenses. One study showed that &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; adhere much more strongly to unworn silicone hydrogel contact lenses than conventional hydrogel lenses and that adhesion of &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; was 20 times stronger than that of &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;. This might partly explain why &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; infections are the most predominant. However, another study conducted with worn and unworn silicone and conventional hydrogel contact lenses showed that worn silicone contact lenses were less prone to &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; colonization than conventional hydrogel lenses.

Besides bacterial adhesion and cleaning, micro and nano pollutants (biological and manmade) is an area of contact lens research that is growing. Small physical pollutants ranging from nanoplastics to fungi spores to plant pollen adhere to contact lens surfaces in high concentrations. It has been found that multipurpose solution and rubbing with fingers does not significantly clean the lenses. A group of researchers have suggested an alternative cleaning solution, PoPPR (polymer on polymer pollution removal). This cleaning technique takes advantage of a soft and porous polymer to physically peel pollutants off of contact lenses.

Another important area of contact lens research deals with patient compliance. Compliance is a major issue pertaining to the use of contact lenses because patient noncompliance often leads to contamination of the lens, storage case, or both. However, careful users can extend the wear of lenses through proper handling: there is, unfortunately, no disinterested research on the issue of &quot;compliance&quot; or the length of time a user can safely wear a lens beyond its stated use. The introduction of multipurpose solutions and daily disposable lenses have helped to alleviate some of the problems observed from inadequate cleaning but new methods of combating microbial contamination are currently being developed. A silver-impregnated lens case has been developed which helps to eradicate any potentially contaminating microbes that come in contact with the lens case. Additionally, a number of antimicrobial agents are being developed that have been embedded into contact lenses themselves. Lenses with covalently attached selenium molecules have been shown to reduce bacterial colonization without adversely affecting the cornea of a rabbit eye and octyl glucoside used as a lens surfactant significantly decreases bacterial adhesion. These compounds are of particular interest to contact lens manufacturers and prescribing optometrists because they do not require any patient compliance to effectively attenuate the effects of bacterial colonization.

One area of research is in the field of bionic lenses. These are visual displays that include built-in electric circuits and light-emitting diodes and can harvest radio waves for their electric power. Bionic lenses can display information beamed from a mobile device overcoming the small display size problem. The technology involves embedding nano and microscale electronic devices in lenses. These lenses will also need to have an array of microlenses to focus the image so that it appears suspended in front of the wearer&#x27;s eyes. The lens could also serve as a head-up display for pilots or gamers.

Drug administration through contact lenses is also becoming an area of research. One application is a lens that releases anesthesia to the eye for post-surgery pain relief, especially after PRK (photorefractive keratectomy) in which the healing process takes several days. One experiment shows that silicone contact lenses that contain vitamin E deliver pain medication for up to seven days compared with less than two hours in usual lenses.

Another study of the usage of contact lens is aimed to address the issue of macular degeneration (AMD or age-related macular degeneration). An international collaboration of researchers was able to develop a contact lens that can shift between magnified and normal vision. Previous solutions to AMD included bulky glasses or surgical implants. But the development of this new contact lens, which is made of polymethyl methacrylate, could offer an unobtrusive solution.

==In popular culture==

===Films===
One of the earliest known motion pictures to introduce the use of contact lenses as a make-up artist&#x27;s device for enhancing the eyes was by the innovative actor Lon Chaney in the 1926 film &quot;The Road to Mandalay&quot; to create the effect of a character who had a blind eye. Dr. Rueben Greenspoon applied them to Orson Welles for the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in 1940. In the 1950s, contact lenses were starting to be used in British color horror films. An early example of this is the British actor Christopher Lee as the Dracula character in the 1958 color horror film &quot;Dracula&quot;, which helped to emphasize his horrific looking black pupils and red bloodshot eyes. Tony Curtis wore them in the 1968 film &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;. Contact lenses were also used to better emphasize the sinister gaze of the demonic characters in 1968&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; and 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Colored custom-made contact lenses are now standard makeup for a number of special effects-based movies.

<text>A geographer is a physical scientist, social scientist or humanist whose area of study is geography, the study of Earth&#x27;s natural environment and human society, including how society and nature interacts. The Greek prefix &quot;geo&quot; means &quot;earth&quot; and the Greek suffix, &quot;graphy&quot;, meaning &quot;description&quot;, so a geographer is someone who studies the earth. The word &quot;geography&quot; is a Middle French word that is believed to have been first used in 1540.

Although geographers are historically known as people who make maps, map making is actually the field of study of cartography, a subset of geography. Geographers do not study only the details of the natural environment or human society, but they also study the reciprocal relationship between these two. For example, they study how the natural environment contributes to human society and how human society affects the natural environment.

In particular, physical geographers study the natural environment while human geographers study human society and culture. Some geographers are practitioners of GIS (geographic information system) and are often employed by local, state, and federal government agencies as well as in the private sector by environmental and engineering firms.

The paintings by Johannes Vermeer titled &quot;The Geographer&quot; and &quot;The Astronomer&quot; are both thought to represent the growing influence and rise in prominence of scientific enquiry in Europe at the time of their painting in 1668–69.

== Areas of study in geography ==
Subdividing geography is challenging, as the discipline is broad, interdisciplinary, ancient, and has been approached differently by different cultures. Attempts have gone back centuries, and include the &quot;Four traditions of geography&quot; and applied &quot;branches.&quot; 
===Four traditions of geography===
The four traditions of geography were proposed in 1964 by William D. Pattison in a paper titled &quot;The Four Traditions of Geography&quot; appearing in the Journal of Geography. These traditions are:
* spatial or locational tradition
* area studies or regional tradition
* Human–Environment interaction tradition (originally referred to as the &quot;man-land tradition&quot;)
* Earth science tradition

===Branches of geography===
The UNESCO Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems subdivides geography into three major fields of study, which are then further subdivided. These are:

* Human geography: including urban geography, cultural geography, economic geography, political geography, historical geography, marketing geography, health geography, and social geography.
* Physical geography: including geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, biogeography, climatology, meteorology, pedology, oceanography, geodesy, and environmental geography.
* Technical geography: including geoinformatics, geographic information science, geovisualization, and spatial analysis.

===Five themes of geography===
The National Geographic Society identifies five broad key themes for geographers:
* human-environment interaction
* Location
* Movement
* Place
* Regions

==Notable geographers==
* Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859) – published &quot;Cosmos&quot; and founder of the sub-field biogeography.
* Arnold Henry Guyot (1807–1884) – noted the structure of glaciers and advanced understanding in glacier motion, especially in fast ice flow.
* Carl O. Sauer (1889–1975) – cultural geographer.
* Carl Ritter (1779–1859) – occupied the first chair of geography at Berlin University.
* David Harvey (born 1935) – Marxist geographer and author of theories on spatial and urban geography, winner of the Vautrin Lud Prize.
* Doreen Massey (1944–2016) – scholar in the space and places of globalization and its pluralities; winner of the Vautrin Lud Prize.
* Edward Soja (1940–2015) – worked on regional development, planning and governance and coined the terms synekism and postmetropolis; winner of the Vautrin Lud Prize.
* Ellen Churchill Semple (1863–1932) – first female president of the American Association of Geographers.
* Jovan Cvijić (1865–1927) – Serbian geographer, geologist, sociologist and human geographer; father of the karst geomorphology
* Eratosthenes () – calculated the size of the Earth.
* Ernest Burgess (1886–1966) – creator of the concentric zone model.
* Gerardus Mercator (1512–1594) – cartographer who produced the Mercator projection
* John Francon Williams (1854–1911) – author of &quot;The Geography of the Oceans&quot;.
* Karl Butzer (1934–2016) – German-American geographer, cultural ecologist and environmental archaeologist.
* Michael Frank Goodchild (born 1944) – GIS scholar and winner of the RGS founder&#x27;s medal in 2003.
* Milton Santos (1926–2001) – became known for his pioneering works in several branches of geography, notably urban development in developing countries.
* Muhammad al-Idrisi (; Latin: Dreses) (1100–1165) – author of Nuzhatul Mushtaq.
* Nigel Thrift (born 1949) – originator of non-representational theory.
* Paul Vidal de La Blache (1845–1918) – founder of the French school of geopolitics, wrote the principles of human geography.
* Ptolemy () – compiled Greek and Roman knowledge into the book &quot;Geographia&quot;.
* Radhanath Sikdar (1813–1870) – calculated the height of Mount Everest.
* Roger Tomlinson (1933 – 2014) – the primary originator of modern geographic information systems. 
* Halford Mackinder (1861–1947) – co-founder of the London School of Economics, Geographical Association.
* Strabo (64/63 BC – ) – wrote &quot;Geographica&quot;, one of the first books outlining the study of geography.
* Waldo Tobler (1930–2018) – coined the first law of geography.
* Walter Christaller (1893–1969) – human geographer and inventor of central place theory.
* William Morris Davis (1850–1934) – father of American geography and developer of the cycle of erosion.
* Yi-Fu Tuan (1930–2022) – Chinese-American scholar credited with starting humanistic geography as a discipline.
