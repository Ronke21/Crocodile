<text>Hutterites (; ), also called Hutterian Brethren (German: ), are a communal ethnoreligious branch of Anabaptists, who, like the Amish and Mennonites, trace their roots to the Radical Reformation of the early 16th century and have formed intentional communities.

The founder of the Hutterites, Jakob Hutter, &quot;established the Hutterite colonies on the basis of the Schleitheim Confession, a classic Anabaptist statement of faith&quot; of 1527, and the first communes were formed in 1528. Since the death of Hutter in 1536, the beliefs of the Hutterites, especially those espousing a community of goods and nonresistance, have resulted in hundreds of years of diaspora in many countries. The Hutterites embarked on a series of migrations through central and eastern Europe. Nearly extinct by the 18th century, they migrated to Russia in 1770 and about a hundred years later to North America. Over the course of 140 years, their population living in communities of goods recovered from about 400 to around 50,000 at present. Today, almost all Hutterites live in Western Canada and the upper Great Plains of the United States.

== History ==

=== Beginnings ===
The Anabaptist movement, from which the Hutterites emerged, started in groups that formed after the early Reformation in Switzerland led by Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531). These new groups were part of the Radical Reformation, which departed from the teachings of Zwingli and the Swiss Reformed Church. In Zürich on January 21, 1525, Conrad Grebel (c. 1498–1526) and Jörg Blaurock (c. 1491–1529) practiced adult baptism to each other and then to others. From Switzerland Anabaptism quickly spread northward and eastward in the timespan of one year. Balthasar Hubmaier (c. 1480–1528), a Bavarian from Friedberg, became an Anabaptist in Zürich in 1525 but fled to Nikolsburg in Moravia in May 1526. Other early Anabaptists who became important for the emerging Hutterites were Hans Denck (c. 1500–1527), Hans Hut (1490–1527), Hans Schlaffer († 1528), Leonhard Schiemer (c. 1500–1528), Ambrosius Spittelmayr (1497–1528) and Jakob Widemann († 1536). Most of these early Anabaptists soon became martyrs of their faith.

=== Tyrol ===
Anabaptism appears to have come to Tyrol through the labors of Jörg Blaurock. The Gaismair uprising set the stage by producing a hope for social justice in a way that was similar to the German Peasants&#x27; War. Michael Gaismair had tried to bring religious, political, and economical reform through a violent peasant uprising, but the movement was squashed. Although little hard evidence exists of a direct connection between Gaismair&#x27;s uprising and Tyrolian Anabaptism, at least a few of the peasants involved in the uprising later became Anabaptists. While a connection between a violent social revolution and non-resistant Anabaptism may be hard to imagine, the common link was the desire for a radical change in the prevailing social injustices. Disappointed with the failure of armed revolt, Anabaptist ideals of an alternative peaceful, just society probably resonated on the ears of the disappointed peasants.

Before Anabaptism proper was introduced to South Tyrol, Protestant ideas had been propagated in the region by men such as Hans Vischer, a former Dominican. Some of those who participated in conventicles where Protestant ideas were presented later became Anabaptists. As well, the population in general seemed to have a favorable attitude towards reform, be it Protestant or Anabaptist. Jörg Blaurock appears to have preached itinerantly in the Puster Valley region in 1527, which most likely was the first introduction of Anabaptist ideas in the area. Another visit through the area in 1529 reinforced these ideas, but he was captured and burned at the stake in Klausen on September 6, 1529.

Jakob Hutter was one of the early converts in South Tyrol and later became a leader among the Hutterites, who received their name from him. Hutter made several trips between Moravia and Tyrol—most of the Anabaptists in South Tyrol ended up emigrating to Moravia because of the fierce persecution unleashed by Ferdinand I. In November 1535, Hutter was captured near Klausen and taken to Innsbruck, where he was burned at the stake on February 25, 1536. By 1540 Anabaptism in South Tyrol was beginning to die out, largely because of the emigration to Moravia of the converts to escape incessant persecution.

=== Moravia and Hungary ===
In the 16th century, there was a considerable degree of religious tolerance in Moravia because in the 15th century there had been several proto-Protestant movements and upheavals (Czech Brethren, Utraquists, Picards, Minor Unity) in Bohemia and Moravia due to the teachings of Jan Hus (c. 1369–1415).

Therefore, Moravia, where Hubmaier had also found refuge, was the land where the persecuted Anabaptist forerunners of the Hutterites fled to, originating mostly from different locations in what is today Southern Germany, Austria and South Tyrol. Under the leadership of Jakob Hutter in the years 1530 to 1535, they developed the communal form of living that distinguishes them from other Anabaptists, such as the Mennonites and the Amish. Hutterite communal living is based on the New Testament books of the Acts of the Apostles (chapters 2 (especially verse 44), 4, and 5) and 2 Corinthians.

A basic tenet of Hutterite groups has always been nonresistance, i.e., forbidding its members from taking part in military activities, taking orders from military persons, wearing a formal uniform (such as a soldier&#x27;s or a police officer&#x27;s) or paying taxes to be spent on war. This has led to expulsion from or persecution in the several lands in which they have lived.

In Moravia, the Hutterites flourished for several decades; the period between 1554 and 1565 was called &quot;good&quot; and the period between 1565 and 1592 was called &quot;golden&quot;. During that time the Hutterites expanded to Upper Hungary, present-day Slovakia. In the time until 1622 some 100 settlements, called , developed in Moravia and Kingdom of Hungary, and the number of Hutterites reached twenty to thirty thousand.

In 1593 the Long Turkish War, which affected the Hutterites severely, broke out. During this war, in 1605, some 240 Hutterites were abducted by the Ottoman Turkish army and their Tatar allies and sold into Ottoman slavery. It lasted until 1606; however, before the Hutterites could rebuild their resources, the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) broke out. It soon developed into a war about religion when in 1620 the mostly Protestant Bohemia and Moravia were invaded by the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II, a Catholic, who annihilated and plundered several Hutterite settlements. In 1621 the Bubonic plague followed the war and killed one third of the remaining Hutterites.

Renewed persecution followed the Habsburg takeover of the Czech lands in 1620 and in the end annihilated them there as an Anabaptist group. In 1622 the Hutterites were expelled from Moravia and fled to the Hutterite settlements in Hungary, where overcrowding caused severe hardship. Some Moravian Hutterites converted to Catholicism and retained a separate ethnic identity as the Habans (German: ) until the 19th century (by the end of World War II, the Haban group had become essentially extinct).

=== Transylvania ===
In 1621 Gabriel Bethlen, prince of Transylvania and a Calvinist, &quot;invited&quot; Hutterites to come to his country. In fact he forced a group of 186 Hutterites to come to Alvinc (today Vințu de Jos, Romania) in 1622, because he needed craftsmen and agricultural workers to develop his land. In the next two years more Hutterites migrated to Transylvania, in total 690 or 1,089 persons, depending on the sources.

In the second half of the 17th century, the Hutterite community was in decline. It had suffered from Ottoman incursions during which the at Alvinc was burned down in 1661. Towards the end of the century, community of goods was abandoned, when exactly is not known. Johannes Waldner assumes in &quot;Das Klein-Geschichtsbuch der Hutterischen Brüder&quot; that this happened in 1693 or 1694.

In 1756, a group of Crypto-Protestants from Carinthia who in 1755 were deported to Transylvania by the Habsburg monarchy, met the Hutterian Brethren at Alvinc. These Carinthian Protestants read the &quot;account of the belief of the Hutterian Brethren&quot; written by Peter Riedemann, which was given to them by the Brothers, and then decided to join the Hutterites. This latter group revived the Hutterite religion, became dominant among the Hutterites and replaced the Tyrolean dialect of the old Hutterites by their Carinthian one, both being Southern Bavarian dialects. In 1762 community of goods was reestablished in Alvinc.

=== Wallachia ===
In 1767 the Hutterites fled from Transylvania first to Kräbach, that is Ciorogârla in Wallachia, which was at that time some from Bucharest. When the Hutterites left Transylvania, their number was down to 67 people.

In Wallachia they encountered much hardship because of lawlessness and the war between Russia and Turkey (1768–1774). The Russians took Bucharest on November 17, 1769. The Hutterites then sought the advice of Russian army commander &quot;Sämetin&quot; (Генерал-майор Александр Гаврилович Замятин, General-Mayor Aleksandr Gavrilovitch Zamyatin) in Bucharest, who proposed that they emigrate to Russia where Count Pyotr Rumyantsev would provide them with land all they need for a new beginning.

=== Ukraine ===
On August 1, 1770, after more than three months of traveling, the group of about 60 persons reached their new home, the lands of Count Rumyantsev at Vishenka in Ukraine, which at this time was part of the Russian Empire. In their new home, the Hutterites were joined by a few more Hutterites who could flee from Habsburg lands, as well as a few Mennonites, altogether 55 persons.

When Count Pyotr Rumyantsev died in 1796, his two sons tried to reduce the status of the Hutterites from free peasants () to that of serfs (). The Hutterites appealed to Tsar Paul I, who allowed them to settle on crown land in Radichev, some 12 km (7 miles) from Vishenka, where they would have the same privileged status as the German Mennonite colonists from Prussia.

Around the year 1820 there was significant inner tension: a large faction of the brothers wanted to end the community of goods. The community then divided into two groups that lived as separate communities. The faction with individual ownership moved to the Mennonite colony Chortitza for some time, but soon returned. After a fire destroyed most of the buildings at Radichev, the Hutterites gave up their community of goods.

Because the lands of the Hutterites at Radichev were not very productive, they petitioned to move to better lands. In 1842 they were allowed to relocate to Molotschna, a Mennonite colony, where they founded the village Hutterthal. When they moved, the total Hutterite population was 384 with 185 males and 199 females.

In 1852 a second village was founded, called Johannesruh and, by 1868, three more villages were founded: Hutterdorf (1856), Neu-Huttertal (1856), and Scheromet (1868). In Ukraine, the Hutterites enjoyed relative prosperity. When they lived among German-speaking Mennonites in Molotschna, they adopted the very efficient form of Mennonite agriculture that Johann Cornies had introduced.

In 1845, a small group of Hutterites made plans to renew the community of goods, but was told to wait until the government had approved their plans to buy separate land. A group led by the preacher George Waldner made another attempt but this soon failed. In 1859 Michael Waldner was able to reinstate community of goods at one end of Hutterdorf, thus becoming the founder of the Schmiedeleut.

In 1860, Darius Walter founded another group with community of goods at the other end of Hutterdorf, thus creating the Dariusleut. Trials to establish a communal living in Johannisruh after 1864 did not succeed. It took until 1877, after the Hutterites had already relocated to South Dakota, before a few families from Johannisruh, led by preacher Jacob Wipf, established a third group with communal living, the Lehrerleut.

In 1864, the Primary Schools&#x27; Bill made Russian the language of instruction in schools; then in 1871 a law introduced compulsory military service. These led the Mennonites and Hutterites to make plans for emigration.

=== United States ===
After sending scouts to North America in 1873 along with a Mennonite delegation, almost all Hutterites, totaling 1,265 individuals, migrated to the United States between 1874 and 1879 in response to the new Russian military service law. Of these, some 800 identified as (literally, &quot;owners&quot;) and acquired individual farms according to the Homestead Act of 1862, whereas some 400 identified as (literally, &quot;community people&quot;) and started three communities with community of goods.

Most Hutterites are descended from these latter 400. Named for the leader of each group (the Schmiedeleut, Dariusleut and Lehrerleut, being based on the German word for &quot;people&quot;), they settled initially in the Dakota Territory. Here, each group reestablished the traditional Hutterite communal lifestyle.

Over the next decades, the Hutterites who settled on individual farms, the so-called Prärieleut, slowly assimilated first into Mennonite groups and later into the general American population. Until about 1910 there was intermarriage between the Prärieleut and the communally living Hutterites.

Several state laws were enacted seeking to deny Hutterites religious legal status to their communal farms (colonies). Some colonies were disbanded before these decisions were overturned in the Supreme Court. By this time, many Hutterites had already established new colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
During World War I, the pacifist Hutterites suffered persecution in the United States. In the most severe case, four Hutterite men, who were subjected to military draft but refused to comply, were imprisoned and physically abused. Ultimately, two of the four men, the brothers Joseph and Michael Hofer, died at Leavenworth Military Prison after the Armistice had been signed, bringing an end to the war. The Hutterite community said the men died from mistreatment; the U.S. government said the men died of pneumonia.

=== Canada ===
The Hutterites responded to this mistreatment of their conscientious objectors by leaving the United States and moving to the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan. All 18 existing American colonies were abandoned, except the oldest one, Bon Homme, where Hutterites continued to live. Other colonies moved to Canada but did not sell their vacant colonies.

In 1942, alarmed at the influx of Dakota Hutterites buying copious tracts of land, the Province of Alberta passed the &quot;Communal Properties Act&quot;, severely restricting the expansion of the Dariusleut and Lehrerleut colonies. Although disallowed by the federal government in 1943the last time provincial legislation was so disallowed in Canadian historyand eventually repealed in 1973, the act resulted in the establishment of a number of new colonies in British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

The Hutterian Brethren Church was recognized by Parliament in 1951.

As of March 2018, there were approximately 34,000 Hutterites in 350 colonies in Canada, 75 percent of the Brethren living in North America. During summer 2020, many colonies struggled with outbreaks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada because &quot;Hutterite colony members eat, work, and worship together in community settings and share possessions&quot;, according to one report. The groups were taking steps to minimize the spread of the virus.

One news report defined the business operations of colonies as &quot;industrial grade farms that produce grains, eggs, meat and vegetables, which are sold to large distributors and at local farmer&#x27;s markets&quot;.

Section 143 of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot; of Canada, introduced in 2007 and modified in 2014 with section 108(5), contains special rules to accommodate Hutterite colonies. According to a 2018 Senate report, colonies do not file income tax returns as corporations, but as individual members:

Based on a memorandum of understanding between the Hutterites and the Minister of National Revenue, section 143 creates a fictional trust to which all the property of the Hutterite colony and any associated income belongs. The trust&#x27;s income may then be allocated to the individual Hutterite members, according to a formula set out in section 143, who can then claim the income on their personal tax returns.

In 2018, the Senate of Canada asked the House of Commons to review the legislation, because Hutterites were not being allowed to claim the Working Income Tax Benefit refundable tax credit (WITB), which was available to other farmers in Canada.

=== Partial return to the U.S. ===
During the Great Depression when there was a lot of economic pressure on farming populations, some Schmiedeleut moved back to South Dakota, resettling abandoned property and buying abandoned colonies from the Darius- and the Lehrerleut. After World War II some Darius- and Lehrerleut also went back to the U.S., mainly to Montana.

== Theology ==
Contrary to other traditional Anabaptist groups, like the Amish, the Old Order Mennonites and the Old Colony Mennonites, who have almost no written books about Anabaptist theology, the Hutterites possess an account of their beliefs, &quot;Account of Our Religion, Doctrine and Faith, of the brethren who are called Hutterites&quot; (original German title ), written by Peter Riedemann in 1540–1541. There are also extant theological tracts and letters by Hans Schlaffer, Leonhard Schiemer, and Ambrosius Spittelmaier.

The founder of the Hutterite tradition, Jakob Hutter, &quot;established the Hutterite colonies on the basis of the Schleitheim Confession, a classic Anabaptist statement of faith&quot;. In accordance with this confession of faith, Hutterite theology emphasizes credobaptism, a belief in the Church invisible, Christian pacifism, and the rejection of oaths. The Hutterite Churches also believe in &quot;a set of community rules for Christian living and the principle of worldly separation&quot;. Former members are shunned and are not to be spoken to.

== Society ==

Hutterite communes, called &quot;colonies&quot;, are all rural; many depend largely on farming or ranching, depending on their locale, for their income. Colonies in the modern era have been shifting to manufacturing as making a living on farming alone gets more difficult. The colony is virtually self-sufficient as far as labor, constructing its own buildings, doing its own maintenance and repair on equipment, making its own clothes, etc., is concerned. This has changed in recent [when?] years, and colonies have started to depend a little more on outside sources for food, clothing and other goods.

Hutterite agriculture today is specialized and more or less industrialized. Hutterite children therefore have no close contact with farm animals any longer and are not protected from asthma through close contact with farm animals, as Amish children are, but are now similar to the general North American population.

=== Governance and leadership ===
Hutterite colonies are mostly patriarchal with women participating in roles such as cooking, medical decisions, and selection and purchase of fabric for clothing. Each colony has three high-level leaders. The two top-level leaders are the Minister and the Secretary. A third leader is the Assistant Minister. The Minister also holds the position as president in matters related to the incorporation of the legal business entity associated with each colony. The Secretary is widely referred to as the colony &quot;Manager&quot;, &quot;Boss&quot; or &quot;Business Boss&quot; and is responsible for the business operations of the colony, such as bookkeeping, cheque-writing and budget organization. The Assistant Minister helps with church leadership (preaching) responsibilities, but will often also be the &quot;German Teacher&quot; for the school-aged children.

The Secretary&#x27;s wife sometimes holds the title of &quot;Schneider&quot; (from German &quot;tailor&quot;) and thus she is in charge of clothes&#x27; making and purchasing the colony&#x27;s fabric requirements for the making of all clothing. The term &quot;boss&quot; is used widely in colony language. Aside from the Secretary, who functions as the business boss, there are a number of other significant &quot;boss&quot; positions in most colonies. The most significant in the average colony is the &quot;Farm Boss&quot;. This person is responsible for all aspects of overseeing grain farming operations. This includes crop management, agronomy, crop insurance planning and assigning staff to various farming operations.

Beyond these top-level leadership positions there will also be the &quot;Hog Boss&quot;, &quot;Dairy Boss&quot;, and so on, depending on what agricultural operations exist at the specific colony. In each case these individuals are fully responsible for their own areas of responsibility, and will have other colony residents working in those respective areas.

The Minister, Secretary, and all &quot;boss&quot; positions are elected positions and many decisions are put to a vote before they are implemented.

The voting and decision-making process at most colonies is based upon a two-tiered structure including a council — usually seven senior males — and the voting membership, which includes all the married men of the colony. For each &quot;significant&quot; decision the council will first vote and, if passed, the decision will be carried to the voting membership. Officials not following the selected decisions can be removed by a similar vote of a colony.

There is a wide range of leadership cultures and styles between the three main colony varieties. In some cases very dominant ministers or secretaries may hold greater sway over some colonies than others.

Women and children hold no formal voting power over decision-making in a colony, but they often hold influence on decision-making through the informal processes of a colony&#x27;s social framework.

Overarching all internal governance processes within a single colony is the broader &quot;Bishop&quot; structure of leaders from across a &quot;branch&quot; (Lehrer-, Darius- or Schmiedeleut) such that all colonies within each branch are subject to the broader decision-making of that branch&#x27;s &quot;Bishop&quot; council. A minister of a colony who does not ensure his colony follows broader &quot;Bishop&quot; council decisions can be removed from his position.

=== Community ownership ===
Hutterites practice a near-total community of goods: all property is owned by the colony, and provisions for individual members and their families come from the common resources. This practice is based largely on Hutterite interpretation of passages in chapters 2, 4, and 5 of Acts, which speak of the believers&#x27; &quot;having all things in common.&quot; Thus the colony owns and operates its buildings and equipment like a corporation, with all profits reinvested in the community. Housing units are built and assigned to individual families but belong to the colony, and there is very little personal property. There are no paychecks on Hutterite colonies, as members are expected to work for the good of the community. Allowances are given, with the monetary amount varying heavily between colonies. Lunch and dinner meals are taken by the entire colony in a dining or fellowship room. Men and women sit in a segregated fashion. Special occasions sometimes allow entire families to enjoy meals together, but individual housing units do have kitchens which are used for breakfast meals.

===Daughter colonies===
Each colony may consist of about 10 to 20 families (may not always apply), with a population of around 60 to 250. When the colony&#x27;s population grows near the upper limit and its leadership determines that branching off is economically and spiritually necessary, they locate, purchase land for and build a &quot;daughter&quot; colony.

The process by which a colony splits to create a new daughter colony varies across the branches of colonies. In Lehrerleut, this process is quite structured, while in Darius and Schmiedeleut the process can be somewhat less so. In a Lehrerleut colony, the land will be purchased and buildings actually constructed before anyone in the colony knows who will be relocating to the daughter colony location. The final decision as to who leaves and who stays will not be made until everything is ready at the new location.

During the construction process, the colony leadership splits up the colony as evenly as possible, creating two separate groups of families. The two groups are made as equal as possible in size, taking into account the practical limits of family unit sizes in each group. Additionally, the leadership must split the business operations as evenly as possible. This means deciding which colony may take on, for example, either hog farming or dairy. Colony members are given a chance to voice concerns about which group a family is assigned to, but at some point, a final decision is made. This process can be very difficult and stressful for a colony, as many political and family dynamics become topics of discussion, and not everyone will be happy about the process or its results.

Once all decisions have been made, the two groups may be identified as &quot;Group A&quot; and &quot;Group B&quot;. The last evening before a new group of people is to leave the &quot;mother&quot; colony for the &quot;daughter&quot; colony, two pieces of paper, labeled &quot;Group A&quot; and &quot;Group B&quot;, are placed into a hat. The minister will pray, asking for God&#x27;s choice of the paper drawn from the hat, and will draw one piece of paper. The name drawn will indicate which group is leaving for the daughter colony. Within hours, the daughter colony begins the process of settling at a brand new site.

This very structured procedure differs dramatically from the one that may be used at some Darius and Schmiedeleut colonies, where the split can sometimes be staggered over time, with only small groups of people moving to the new location at a time.

=== Agriculture and manufacturing ===
Hutterite colonies often own large tracts of land and, since they function as a collective unit, they can make or afford higher-quality equipment than if they were working alone. Some also run industrial hog, dairy, turkey, chicken and egg production operations. An increasing number of Hutterite colonies are again venturing into the manufacturing sector, a change that is reminiscent of an early period of Hutterite life in Europe. Before the Hutterites emigrated to North America, they relied on manufacturing to sustain their communities. It was only in Russia that the Hutterites learned to farm from the Mennonites. Because of the increasing automation of farming (large equipment, GPS-controlled seeding, spraying, etc.), farming operations have become much more efficient. Many colonies that have gone into manufacturing believe they need to provide their members with a higher level of education.

A major driving force for Hutterite leadership nowadays is the recognition that land prices have risen dramatically in Alberta and Saskatchewan because of the oil and gas industry, thus creating the need for a greater amount of cash to buy land when the time comes for a colony to split. The splitting process requires the purchase of land and the construction of buildings. This can require funds in the range of C$20 million in 2008 terms: upwards of $10M for land and another $10M for buildings and construction. This massive cash requirement has forced leadership to reevaluate how a colony can produce the necessary funds. New projects have included plastics&#x27; manufacturing, metal fabrication, cabinetry and stone or granite forming, to name a few. One unique project came together in South Dakota. A group of 44 colonies joined to create a turkey processing center where their poultry can be processed. The plant hired non-Hutterite staff to process the poultry for market. This plant helped to secure demand for the colonies&#x27; poultry.

=== Use of technology ===
Hutterites do not shun modern technology, but may limit some uses of it. Many attempt to remove themselves from the outside world (television sets – and in some cases the internet – are banned), and up until recently, many of the Lehrerleut and Dariusleut (Alberta) colonies still had only one central telephone. The Schmiedeleut, however, made this transition earlier, where each household had a phone along with a central telephone for the colony business operation. In many colonies, telephones are tied into the sort of commercial private branch exchange (PBX) systems more commonly used by businesses, with which toll restriction features could easily be programmed.

Today, Hutteries widely use telephones for both business and social purposes. Cell phones are also very common among all three groups today. Text messaging has made cell phones particularly useful for Hutterian young people wishing to keep in touch with their peers. Some Hutterite homes have computers and radios; and some (mostly liberal Schmiedeleut colonies) have Internet access. Farming equipment technology generally matches or exceeds that of non-Hutterite farmers. Lehrerleut colonies have recently struggled with the proliferation of computers and have clamped down, so that computers are no longer allowed in households and their use is limited to only business and farming operations, including animal, feed and crop management. As the world evolves more, however, and technology is used more and more for work and communication, many Hutterite young people use computers, photos, and the internet for keeping in contact with their friends and relatives and meeting new people outside the colony.

=== Education ===
Hutterite children get their education in a schoolhouse at the colony, according to an educational agreement with the province or state. The school is typically run by a hired &quot;outside&quot; teacher who teaches the basics, including English. In some Schmiedeleut schools, teachers are chosen from the colony. The &quot;German&quot; education of colony children is the responsibility of the &quot;Assistant Minister&quot; at some colonies, but most colonies elect a &quot;German Teacher&quot;, who in most cases also takes care of the colony garden. His job entails training in German language studies, Bible teaching, and scripture memorization. The German Teacher co-operates with the outside teacher with regard to scheduling and planning. Some Hutterite colonies are allowed to send their children to public school as the parents see fit, but in some cases it is customary to remove them from school entirely in 8th grade or at the age of 15; however, many colonies offer them a full grade 12 diploma and in some cases a university degree. Public school in these instances is seen as a luxury and children are sometimes made to miss days of school in favor of duties at the colony. In a few rare cases, allowing a child to continue attending school past this limit can result in punishment of the parents, including shunning and removal from the church.

=== Major branches ===
Three different branches of Hutterites live in the prairies of North America: the Schmiedeleut, the Dariusleut and the Lehrerleut. Though all three &quot;leut&quot; are Hutterites, there are some distinctive differences, including style of dress and organizational structure. However, the original doctrine of all three groups is identical. The differences are mostly traditional and geographic.

There are two other related groups. The Arnoldleut—also referred to as the Bruderhof Communities or currently, Church Communities International—is a group of more recent origin which, prior to 1990, were accepted by the Dariusleut and Lehrerleut groups as a part of the Hutterite community. The Schmiedeleut were divided over the issue; one group(Group 1) is called the &#x27;oilers&#x27;, because of an issue over an oil well and the other group(Group 2) is called the &#x27;Gibbs&#x27;. The other is the Prairieleut – Hutterites that lived in separate households rather than in colonies after settling on the American prairies. At the time of immigration the Prairieleut amounted to around 2/3 of the Hutterite immigrants. Most of the Prairieleut eventually united with the Mennonites.

Since 1992, the Schmiedeleut, until that point the largest of the three &quot;leut,&quot; have been divided into &quot;Group One&quot; and &quot;Group Two&quot; factions over controversies including the Arnoldleut/Bruderhof issue and the leadership of the Schmiedeleut elder. This highly acrimonious division has cut across family lines and remains a serious matter almost three decades later. Group One colonies generally have relatively more liberal positions on issues including higher education, ecumenical and missions work, musical instruments, media, and technology.

=== Photography ===
Alberta Hutterites initially won the right not to have their photographs taken for their driver&#x27;s licenses. In May 2007, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled that the photograph requirement violates their religious rights and that driving was essential to their way of life. The Wilson Colony based its position on the belief that images are prohibited by the Second Commandment. About eighty of the photo-less licenses were in use at the time of the decision. Besides the Alberta Hutterite groups (Darius and Lehrerleut), a handful of colonies in Manitoba (Schmiedeleut) do not wish their members to be photographed for licenses or other identity documents.

However, in July 2009, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled 4–3 (in &quot;Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony&quot;) that a Hutterite community must abide by provincial rules that make a digital photo mandatory for all new driver&#x27;s licenses as a way to prevent identity theft.

From 1972 to 1980, Chicago photographer Mary Koga traveled to rural Alberta to photograph members of the community for her series &quot;The Hutterites&quot;.

A 2018 report published by the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; contained a series of photographs made by Jill Brody over several years at three colonies in Montana.

=== Clothing ===

In contrast to the uniformly plain look of the Amish and Old Order Mennonites, Hutterite clothing can be vividly colored, especially on children, although many Hutterites do wear plain dress. Most of the clothing is homemade within the colony. Shoes were homemade in the past but are now mostly store-bought.

Men&#x27;s jackets and pants are usually black. Generally, the men wear buttoned-up shirts with long sleeves and collars, and they may wear undershirts. Men&#x27;s pants are not held in place by belts, but rather by black suspenders. These pants are also distinctive by their lack of back pockets.

Women and girls each wear a dress with a blouse underneath. Most Lehrerleut and Dariusleut also wear a kerchief-style Christian headcovering which is usually black with white polka dots. The Schmiedleut also wear a kerchief-style head cover, but without the dots. The pattern of kerchief thus indicates to which branch the women belong: large dots indicate Lehrerleut, small dots Dariusleut and no dots Schmiedeleut. In some cases Dariusleut kerchiefs also have no dots. Female members of the Bruderhof wear solid colored kerchiefs in black, blue or white and sometimes no kerchief at all.

Young girls each wear a bright, colorful cap that fastens under the chin.

Church garb is generally dark for both men and women. The clothing worn for church consists of a plain jacket for both genders and a black apron for women. Men&#x27;s church hats are always dark and usually black.

=== Dialect ===
Just as the Amish and Old Order Mennonites often use Pennsylvania Dutch, the Hutterites have preserved and use among themselves a distinct dialect of German known as Hutterite German, or Hutterisch, sometimes regarded as being a language in its own right. Originally mainly based on a Tyrolean dialect from the south-central German-speaking Europe from which many of them sprang in the 16th century, Hutterisch has taken on a Carinthian base because of their history: In the years 1760–1763, a small group of surviving Hutterites in Transylvania were joined by a larger group of Lutheran forced migrants from Carinthia, the so-called Transylvanian Landler. Eventually, this led to the replacement of the Hutterites&#x27; Tyrolean dialect by the Carinthian dialect. The Amish and Hutterite German dialects are not generally mutually intelligible because the dialects originate from regions that are several hundred kilometres (miles) apart. In their religious exercises, Hutterites use a classic Lutheran German.

=== In the courts ===
As part of their Anabaptist teachings of nonresistance, Hutterites historically have avoided getting involved in litigation within the secular justice system. One of the early founders of the Hutterites, Peter Riedemann, wrote about the Hutterites&#x27; stand on going to court in &quot;Peter Riedemann&#x27;s Hutterite Confession of Faith&quot;: &quot;Christ shows that Christians may not go to court when he says, &#x27;If anyone will sue you and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.&#x27; In effect Jesus is saying, &#x27;It is better to let people take everything than to quarrel with them and find yourself in a strange court.&#x27; Christ wants us to show that we seek what is heavenly and belongs to us, and not what is temporal or alien to us. Thus, it is evident that a Christian can neither go to court nor be a judge.&quot;

Consistent with their beliefs, records do not indicate any litigation initiated by the Hutterites up to the twentieth century. However, in their more recent history in North America some Hutterite conflicts have emerged in court litigations. Several cases involved the Hutterite Colony defending their religious lifestyle against the government. This includes the recent conflict over photographs on driver&#x27;s licenses in &quot;Alberta v Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony&quot;. Another recent case in the United States, &quot;Big Sky Colony Inc. v. Montana Department of Labor and Industry&quot;, forced the Hutterites to participate in the workers&#x27; compensation system despite the Hutterites&#x27; religious objections.

The willingness of the colonies to take matters to secular courts has also resulted in internal religious disputes being brought before the court. Two of these cases have come to appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada: &quot;Hofer v. Hofer&quot; (1970) and &quot;Lakeside Colony of Hutterian Brethren v. Hofer&quot; (1992). &quot;Hofer v. Hofer&quot; involved several expelled members of the Interlake Colony in Manitoba who sought a share of the communal property. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that according to the religious tenets of the Hutterites, the Hutterites have no individual property and therefore the former members cannot be entitled to a share of the Hutterite colony&#x27;s goods. In the case of &quot;Lakeside Colony of Hutterian Brethren v. Hofer&quot;, Daniel Hofer Sr. of Lakeside Colony challenged the right of the Hutterian Brethren Church to expel him and other members. The igniting issue focused on who owned the rights to a patented hog feeder. The Board of Managers of the Colony had ruled that Hofer did not own the patent of the hog feeder in question and should stop producing the item. Hofer refused to submit to what he considered was an injustice and also refused to obey the colony&#x27;s order of expulsion. In response Jacob Kleinsasser of Crystal Spring Colony, elder of the Schmiedleut group of Hutterites, tried to use the state to enforce the expulsion order. Daniel Hofer Sr. initially lost the case. Hofer also lost his first appeal but finally won on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, who overturned the expulsion. The outcome of these two cases has strongly influenced the outcome of similar cases in Canada. When some members of The Nine sued their former colony in Manitoba in 2008 over lost wages and injuries the case was never even heard in court.

In the United States judges have repeatedly dismissed cases that were brought against the colony by colony members or former members. Such cases include &quot;Wollma, et al. v. Poinsett Hutterian Brethren, Inc.&quot; (1994) in South Dakota, and &quot;Eli Wollman Sr. et al. v. Ayers Ranch Colony&quot; (2001) in Montana. More recently in North Dakota, a case was brought by some of The Nine against Forest River Colony and was again dismissed by a judge in March 2010, ruling that the courts did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.

== Subgroups ==
In the last 150 years several subgroups of Hutterites emerged. When the Hutterites migrated to the United States in 1874 and during the following years, there was a division between those who settled in colonies and lived with community of goods, and those who settled on private farms according to the conditions of the Homestead Act of 1862. The homesteaders were called Prärieleut, while the ones who settled on the three communal colonies developed into three branches: Schmiedeleut, Dariusleut and Lehrerleut; in the 1990s the Schmiedeleut split into two subgroups.

During the 20th century three groups joined the Hutterites, two of them only temporarily:
*The Owa Hutterite Colony, a Japanese Hutterite community founded in 1972, did not consist of Hutterites of European descent, but ethnic Japanese who had adopted the same way of life and were recognized as an official Dariusleut colony. The inhabitants of this colony spoke neither English nor German. The colony was disbanded on December 31, 2019.
*In similar fashion, a &quot;neo-Hutterite&quot; group, called the , was founded in Germany in 1920 by Eberhard Arnold. Arnold forged links with the North American Hutterites in the 1930s, continuing until 1990 when the Bruderhof were excommunicated because of a number of religious and social differences. They are now an international group with communities in several countries including England and are theologically quite similar to Hutterites, while being more open to outsiders.
*The Community Farm of the Brethren, also called &quot;Juliusleut&quot;, is a Christian community with communal living at Bright, Ontario, created under the leadership of Julius Kubassek (1893–1961). It was in fellowship with the Hutterites from its beginnings, in 1939, until 1950.

Starting in 1999, three Hutterite colonies separated from their original &quot;Leut&quot; affiliation and became independent. For these three colonies spiritual renewal became a major concern. One of them, Elmendorf, branched out two times, so that there are now five colonies of that kind, which co-operate closely, thus forming a new affiliation of Hutterite Christian Communities.

* Fort Pitt Farms Christian Community is a Christian Community of Hutterite Dariusleut origin and with many Hutterite traditions but fully autonomous since 1999, when it was excommunicated from the Hutterite Church, whereupon about one-third of the people of the colony decided to stay with the Dariusleut Hutterites.
* Elmendorf Christian Community, founded in 1998, is a Christian community of Hutterite tradition, but is much more open to outsiders, so-called seekers, than other Hutterite communities.

==Population and distribution==
In 1995, the total North American Hutterite population was about 30,000.

Approximately 75% of all Hutterites reside in Canada, with the remaining 25% living in the United States.

;Canada
In 1995 there were a total of 285 Hutterite colonies in Canada (138 in Alberta, 93 colonies in Manitoba and 54 in Saskatchewan). By 2011, there were 345 across the Prairies – a 21 percent increase. The 2016 census recorded 370 Hutterite colonies in Canada, of these: 175 were in Alberta, 110 in Manitoba and 70 in Saskatchewan.

The same 2016 census which recorded 370 colonies, counted a total Hutterite population of 35,010 people (up from 32,500 in 2011).

;United States
As of March 2018, there were 120 colonies in the United States, of which: 54 colonies in South Dakota, 50 in Montana, nine in Minnesota and seven in North Dakota. A Montana government report in 2010 published a specific list of colonies and schools in that state. Hutterite colonies have existed in the rural farming areas of eastern Washington state since the mid-20th century.

The approximate U.S. population of Brethren was 11,000 in 2018.

In 2020, the U.S. Religion Census counted 15,531 Hutterites (in 145 congregations), of which: 9,041 of Schmiedeleut group (77 congregations), 4,754 of Lehrerleut (43 congregations), 1,409 of Dariusleut (22 congregations) and 327 in other groups (3 congr.).

===Colonies===
The mid-2004 location and number of the world&#x27;s 483 Hutterite colonies:

* Canada (347)
** Dariusleut (142): Alberta (109); Saskatchewan (31); British Columbia (2)
** Schmiedeleut (105): Manitoba (105)
** Lehrerleut (99): Alberta (69); Saskatchewan (30)
* United States (134)
** Schmiedeleut (69): South Dakota (53); Minnesota (9); North Dakota (7)
** Lehrerleut (44): Montana (44)
** Dariusleut (21): Montana (15); Washington (5); Oregon (1)
* Japan (1)
** Dariusleut (1): Owa Hutterite Colony

As of 2021, there are 572 Hutterite colonies in existence.

===Growth===
The very high birth rate among the Hutterites has decreased dramatically since 1950, as they have dropped from around ten children per family in 1954 to around five in 2010. Hutterite fertility rates remain relatively high compared to the general North American population, but relatively low compared to other traditional Anabaptist groups like the Amish or the Old Order Mennonites. While Hutterite women traditionally married around the ages of 20 or 21, marriages in the 21st century very often are delayed until the late 20s. Whereas Hutterite women traditionally had children until their mid 40s, today most Hutterite women have their last child around the age of 35.

==Depiction in media==
&quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941) has a segment that takes place at a Hutterite community in Manitoba, Canada.

&quot;The Hutterites&quot; is a documentary filmed by Colin Law in 1964 with the following synopsis: &quot;The followers of religious leader Jakob Hutter live in farm communities, devoutly holding to the rules their founder laid down four centuries ago. Through the kindness of a Hutterite colony in Alberta, this film, in black and white, was made inside the community and shows all aspects of the Hutterites&#x27; daily life.&quot;

In the &quot;Kung Fu&quot; episode &quot;The Hoots&quot; (December 13, 1973), the sheepherder members of a Hutterite religious sect offer no resistance to persecution by bigoted cattlemen until they learn from Kwai Chang Caine that, like the chameleon, they can change and yet remain the same in the American Southwest.

In Season 1, Episode 9 of the TV series &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;, &quot;Hoots&quot; (November 21, 1974), gypsy truckers Sonny Pruitt (Claude Akins) and Will Chandler (Frank Converse) make a delivery to a Hutterite colony and soon find themselves embroiled in a violent conflict between the pacifists and rival farmers who are angry about the colony outcompeting them.

In the 1994 Leonard Nimoy film &quot;Holy Matrimony&quot;, Havana (Patricia Arquette) is on the run from the law and hides in a Hutterite community in Alberta, Canada, led by Wilhelm (Armin Mueller-Stahl).

On May 29, 2012, the first episode of &quot;American Colony: Meet the Hutterites&quot; aired on the National Geographic Channel. Filmed primarily at King Ranch Colony near Lewistown, Montana, with Jeff Collins as executive producer, the colony was paid $100,000 for permission to produce a documentary of Hutterite life. Immediately after the first airing, many Hutterites began to complain that the show did not represent a true picture of typical colony life and ended up being a reality show or &quot;soap opera&quot; rather than a documentary. Some of the Hutterite cast later said that some of the scenes were scripted and that they were not aware of how the final version would portray the Hutterites. Jeff Collins stated that he believes King Colony members were coerced to write retractions, under threat of excommunication from Hutterite leaders. Colony leaders from King Ranch Colony wrote a letter to the National Geographic Society asking for an apology and that the show be discontinued, citing a false portrayal of Hutterites and a &quot;breach of contract and defamation of our life and our character&quot; as the reason.
In 2013, &quot;How to Get to Heaven with the Hutterites&quot; was broadcast on BBC2 and looked at the lives of the people within the community.

Another film about the Hutterites is &quot;The Valley of All Utopias&quot; (2012), a documentary about a Hutterite colony in Saskatchewan directed by Thomas Risch.

Hutterites were featured in the CBC TV series &quot;Heartland&quot; in Season 8, Episode 7, &quot;Walk a Mile&quot; (2014).

&quot;Queer Hutterite&quot; (2016) is a self-produced documentary by a young gay man who left his home in a Manitoba colony to come out of the closet in Calgary.

Hutterites are also often depicted on the satire website The Daily Bonnet, alongside Mennonites, Amish, and other Anabaptist groups.

<text>Tulips Shall Grow is a 1942 American animated short film in the &quot;Puppetoons&quot; series, directed by George Pal and starring Rex Ingram and Victor Jory. It was released by Paramount Pictures and originally photographed in 3-strip Technicolor. It later became the black-and-white edition by National Telefilm Associates.

==Plot==
A Dutch boy named Jan and a Dutch girl named Janette find their idyllic existence destroyed when they are overrun by a group of Nazi-like mechanical men called &quot;The Screwballs&quot;, who lay waste to everything they touch. The Screwballs are later destroyed by a thunderstorm (the rain of which causes them to rust) and Jan and Janette&#x27;s idyllic life resumes.

The cartoon was nominated for the Oscar for Best Short Subject, Cartoons. In 1997, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

It was also included in the 1987 compilation film &quot;The Puppetoon Movie&quot;.

<text>Twelve O&#x27;Clock High is a 1949 American war film directed by Henry King and based on the novel of the same name by Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay, Jr. It stars Gregory Peck as Brig. General Frank Savage. Hugh Marlowe, Gary Merrill, Millard Mitchell, and Dean Jagger also appear in supporting roles.

The film was nominated for four Academy Awards and won two: Dean Jagger for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and Thomas T. Moulton for Best Sound Recording. In 1998, &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1949, former United States Army Air Forces officer Harvey Stovall spots a familiar Toby Jug in the window of a London antique shop and learns that it came from Archbury, an airfield where Stovall served during World War II. Convinced that it is the same jug which used to stand on the mantel of the airfield&#x27;s officers&#x27; club, he buys it and journeys to the derelict airfield, where he reflects on his wartime experiences.
In a flashback, the setting shifts to 1942, when the 918th Bomb Group at Archbury has gained a reputation as the &quot;hard luck group&quot;. After a particularly disastrous mission, group commander Colonel Keith Davenport appears exhausted and demoralized. His defeatist attitude spreads to other senior leaders of the group, including his Air Exec, Lieutenant Colonel Ben Gately. Ordered to fly another mission the next day, at a dangerously low altitude, Davenport protests to his friend, Brigadier General Frank Savage, the Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at VIII Bomber Command. Later, Savage reluctantly shares with Major General Pritchard, the commanding general of VIII Bomber Command, his belief that Davenport has become emotionally too close to his men and may no longer be fit to command. That night, Pritchard and Savage visit the group headquarters to investigate the cause of the mission&#x27;s heavy losses. After a discussion that ends in Davenport&#x27;s refusal to demote failed navigator Lt. Zimmerman, Pritchard realizes that Savage is right, relieves Davenport of command, hands the command to Savage.

Savage takes a harsh approach to restoring the group&#x27;s discipline and morale. He begins by reprimanding Gately, demoting him to aircraft commander and insisting that he henceforth fly every mission. Savage assigns Gately only the most incompetent crewmen, ordering him to paint the name &quot;Leper Colony&quot; on his airplane. Rough-and-ready Major Cobb impresses Savage with his independent spirit and replaces Gately as Air Exec. Savage conducts a series of training missions and waits for an opportunity to restore the group&#x27;s pride in its abilities. Upset by the contrast of Savage&#x27;s stern leadership with Davenport&#x27;s easygoing ways, all of the group&#x27;s pilots apply for transfers. Savage asks the Group Adjutant, Major Stovall, to delay processing their applications to buy him some time. An attorney in civilian life, Stovall knows how to use bureaucratic red tape to his advantage.

When the group returns to combat, all the groups are ordered to abort their mission due to heavy weather. Savage ignores the recall order. The 918th successfully bombs the target and is the only group to do so. All of its crews return safely. Though Pritchard is furious, Savage claims that he did not hear the recall due to a radio malfunction and instead persuades Pritchard to recommend the group for a Distinguished Unit Citation. Savage also acquires a surrogate son in Lieutenant Jesse Bishop, a Medal of Honor recipient who is Savage&#x27;s eyes and ears among the combat aircrews.
When the Inspector General arrives to investigate the pilots&#x27; transfer requests, Savage packs his belongings, expecting to be relieved of command and possibly court-martialed. But, led by Bishop, the pilots withdraw their requests. Savage also softens his attitude towards the men as he becomes more closely involved with them. Gately goes on to win Savage&#x27;s respect and admiration by demonstrating extraordinary leadership and courage in combat.

With enemy resistance intensifying as the air war advances deeper into Germany, missions become longer and riskier and many of Savage&#x27;s best men are shot down or killed. Pritchard tries to get Savage to return to a staff job at VIII Bomber Command, but Savage feels that the 918th is not yet ready to do without him. Reluctantly, Pritchard leaves him in command. Ordered to return to the same target after a particularly brutal raid on a ball bearing factory, Savage finds himself physically unable to haul himself up into his B-17. Gately takes his place as lead pilot and strike commander for the mission. While waiting for the group&#x27;s return, Savage becomes catatonic. Only as they return to Archbury does he regain his composure and fall asleep.

The story then returns to 1949, as Stovall pedals away from Archbury.

==Historical counterparts of characters==
The character Brigadier General Frank Savage was a composite of several group commanders, but the primary inspiration was Colonel Frank A. Armstrong, who commanded the 306th Bomb Group on which the 918th was modeled. The name &quot;Savage&quot; was inspired by Armstrong&#x27;s Cherokee heritage. While his work with the 306th, which lasted only six weeks, consisted primarily of rebuilding the chain of command within the group, Armstrong had earlier performed a similar task with the 97th Bomb Group. Many of the training and disciplinary scenes in &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; derive from that experience.

Towards the end of the film, the near-catatonic battle fatigue that General Savage suffered and the harrowing missions that led up to it were inspired by the experiences of Brigadier General Newton Longfellow. The symptoms of the breakdown were not based on any real-life event, but instead were intended to portray the effects of intense stress experienced by many airmen.

Major General Pritchard was modeled on the VIII Bomber Command&#x27;s first commander, Major General Ira C. Eaker.

Colonel Keith Davenport was based on the first commander of the 306th Bomb Group, Colonel Charles B. Overacker, nicknamed &quot;Chip&quot;. Of all the personalities portrayed in &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, that of Colonel Davenport most closely parallels his true-life counterpart. The early scene in which Davenport confronts Savage about a mission order was a close recreation of an actual event, as was his relief.

Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Harvey Stovall, who is a former World War I U.S. Army Air Service pilot who has returned to active duty as a nonflying adjutant, was modeled on William Howard Stovall, a World War I flying ace who returned to active duty as a major in the USAAF the week following Pearl Harbor, and served as the nonflying deputy chief of staff for personnel for the 8th Air Force in England for his World War I comrades, Brigadier General Frank O&#x27;Driscoll Hunter and General Carl Spaatz.

Second Lieutenant Jesse Bishop (played by Robert Patten), who belly-lands in the B-17 next to the runway at the beginning of the film and was nominated for the Medal of Honor, had his true-life counterpart in Second Lieutenant John C. Morgan. The description of Bishop&#x27;s fight to control the bomber after his pilot was hit in the head by fragments of a 20 mm cannon shell is taken almost verbatim from Morgan&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation. Details may be found in &quot;The 12 O&#x27;Clock High Logbook&quot;. Patten had been a USAAF navigator in World War II, the only member of the cast with aircrew experience.

Sergeant McIllhenny was drawn from a member of the 306th Bomb Group, Sgt Donald Bevan, a qualified gunner who was assigned ground jobs, including part-time driver for the commander of his squadron. Bevan had received publicity as a stowaway gunner (similar to McIllhenny in the film), though in reality, he had been invited to fly missions. Like McIllhenny, he proved to be a &quot;born gunner&quot;.

The &quot;tough guy&quot; character Major Joe Cobb was inspired by Colonel Paul Tibbets, who had flown B-17s with Colonel Armstrong. Tibbets was initially approved as the film&#x27;s technical advisor in February 1949, but was replaced shortly after by Colonel John H. de Russy, a former operations officer for the 305th Bomb Group.

==Production==
According to their files, 20th Century Fox paid $100,000 outright for the rights to the unfinished book, plus up to $100,000 more in escalator and book-club clauses. Darryl Zanuck was apparently convinced to pay this high price when he heard that William Wyler was interested in purchasing it for Paramount. Even then, Zanuck only went through with the deal in October 1947 when he was certain that the United States Air Force would support the production. The film made use of actual combat footage during the battle scenes, including some shot by the Luftwaffe. A good deal of the production was filmed on Eglin Air Force Base and its associated auxiliary fields near Fort Walton, Florida.

===Source material===
Screenwriters Bartlett and Lay drew on their own wartime experiences with Eighth Air Force bomber units. At the Eighth Air Force headquarters, Bartlett had worked closely with Colonel Armstrong, who was the primary model for the character General Savage. The film&#x27;s 918th Bomber Group was modeled primarily on the 306th because that group remained a significant part of the Eighth Air Force throughout the war in Europe.

===Casting===
Clark Gable was interested in the lead role of General Frank Savage. Gable, who had served in the USAAF during World War II, played a similar role in the 1948 film &quot;Command Decision&quot;. John Wayne was offered the leading role, as well, but turned it down. Burt Lancaster, James Cagney, Dana Andrews, Van Heflin, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Preston, Robert Young, and Robert Montgomery were also considered for the role. Eventually, the role went to Gregory Peck, who initially turned it down because the script was similar to &quot;Command Decision&quot;. Peck changed his mind because he was impressed with director Henry King, finding his empathy with the material and the cast and crew appealing. The two made more films together: &quot;The Gunfighter&quot; (1950), &quot;David and Bathsheba&quot; (1952), &quot;The Bravados&quot; (1958), and &quot;Beloved Infidel&quot; (1959).

===Filming===
Veterans of the heavy bomber campaign frequently cite &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; as the only Hollywood film that accurately captured their combat experiences. Along with the 1948 film &quot;Command Decision&quot;, it marked a turning away from the optimistic, morale-boosting style of wartime films and toward a grittier realism that deals more directly with the human costs of war. Both films deal with the realities of daylight precision bombing without fighter escort, the basic USAAF doctrine at the start of World War II (prior to the arrival of long-range Allied fighter aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang). As producers, writers Lay and Bartlett reused major plot elements of &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; in later films featuring the U.S. Air Force, the 1950s-era &quot;Toward the Unknown&quot; and the early 1960s Cold War-era &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot;.

Paul Mantz, Hollywood&#x27;s leading stunt pilot, was paid the then-unprecedented sum of $4,500 in 1948 ($58,000 in 2024) to crash-land a B-17 bomber for one early scene in the film. Frank Tallman, Mantz&#x27; partner in Tallmantz Aviation, wrote in his autobiography that while many B-17s had been landed by one pilot, as far as he knew, this flight was the first time that a B-17 ever took off with only one pilot and no other crew; nobody was sure that it could be done. &quot; The footage was used again in the 1962 film &quot;The War Lover&quot;.

Locations for creating the bomber airfield at the fictional RAF Archbury were scouted by director Henry King, flying his own Beech Bonanza some 16,000 miles in February and March 1949. King visited Eglin AFB on March 8, 1949, and found an ideal location for principal photography several miles north of the main base at its Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field No. 3, better known as Duke Field, where the mock installation with 15 buildings (including a World War II control tower) were constructed to simulate RAF Archbury. The film&#x27;s technical advisor, Colonel John de Russy, was stationed at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, at the time, and suggested Ozark Army Air Field near Daleville, Alabama (now known as Cairns Army Airfield, adjacent to Fort Rucker). King chose Cairns as the location for filming B-17 takeoffs and landings, including the B-17 belly landing sequence, since the light-colored runways at Eglin did not match wartime runways in England, which had been black to make them less visible to enemy aircraft. When the crew arrived at Cairns, it was also considered as &quot;ideal for shots of Harvey Stovall reminiscing about his World War II service&quot;, since the field was somewhat overgrown. The opening and closing scenes of the derelict RAF Archbury, referencing themes in the film, have a very similar approach to the opening scenes of the derelict fictional RAF Halfpenny Field in the earlier 1945 film &quot;The Way to the Stars&quot;.

Additional background photography was shot at RAF Barford St John, a satellite station of RAF Croughton in Oxfordshire, England. Officially, the airfield is still under Ministry of Defence ownership following its closure in the late 1990s as a communications station linked to the since-closed RAF Upper Heyford. Other locations around Eglin AFB and Fort Walton also served as secondary locations for filming. The crew used 12 B-17s for filming, which were pulled from QB-17 drones used at Eglin and other B-17s from depot locations in Alabama and New Mexico. Since some of the aircraft had been used in the 1946 Bikini atomic experiments and absorbed high levels of radioactivity, they could only be used for shooting for limited periods.

&quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; was in production from late April to early July 1949. Although originally planned to be shot in Technicolor, it was instead shot in black and white, allowing the inclusion of actual combat footage by Allied and Luftwaffe cameras.

==Reception==
&quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; premiered in Los Angeles on December 21, 1949, and opened in New York City on January 26, 1950. It went into general release in February 1950. An influential review by Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was indicative of many contemporary reviews. He noted that the film focused more on the human element than the aircraft or machinery of war. The &quot;Times&quot; picked &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; as one of the 10 Best Films of 1949 and, in later years, it rated the film as one of the &quot;Best 1000&quot; of all time.

After attending the premiere, the commander of the Strategic Air Command, General Curtis LeMay, told the authors that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.&quot; It was required viewing at all the U.S. service academies, college/university Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps detachments, Air Force Officer Training Schools, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s former Aviation Officer Candidate School, and the Coast Guard Officer Candidate School, where it was used as a teaching example for the situational leadership theory, although not currently used by the USAF. The film is also widely used in both the military and civilian worlds to teach the principles of leadership.

Michael Gebert declares it the best film of 1949. and Christopher Tookey writes, it is &quot;probably the best picture about the pressures which war imposes on those at the top.&quot;

In its initial release, the film took in $3,225,000 in rentals in the U.S. alone.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; won Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Dean Jagger and Best Sound Recording. It was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Gregory Peck and Best Picture. In addition, Peck received the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor, and the film was nominated for Best Picture by the National Board of Review.

In 1998, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Meaning of the title==

The term &quot;twelve o&#x27;clock high&quot; refers to the practice of calling out the positions of attacking enemy aircraft by reference to an imaginary clock face, with the bomber at the center. The terms &quot;high&quot; (above the bomber), &quot;level&quot; (at the same altitude as the bomber) and &quot;low&quot; (below the bomber) further refine the location of the enemy. Thus &quot;twelve o&#x27;clock high&quot; meant the attacker was approaching from directly ahead and above. This location was preferred by German fighter pilots because, until the introduction of the Bendix chin turret in the B-17G model, the nose of the B-17 was the most lightly armed and vulnerable part of the bomber. Enemy fighter aircraft diving from above were also more difficult targets for the B-17 gunners due to their high closing speeds.

Bartlett&#x27;s wife, actress Ellen Drew, named the story after hearing Bartlett and Lay discuss German fighter tactics, which usually involved head-on attacks from &quot;twelve o&#x27;clock high&quot;.

==Radio and television==

Gregory Peck repeated his role as General Savage on a &quot;Screen Guild Players&quot; radio broadcast on September 7, 1950.

&quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; later became a television series of the same name that premiered on the ABC network in 1964 and ran for three seasons. Robert Lansing played General Savage. At the end of the first season, Lansing was replaced by Paul Burke, who played Colonel Joseph Anson &quot;Joe&quot; Gallagher, a character loosely based on Ben Gately from the novel. Much of the combat footage seen in the film was reused in the television series.

Many of the television show&#x27;s ground scenes were filmed at the Chino, California, airport, which had been used for training Army pilots during the war, and where a replica of a control tower, typical of the type seen at an 8th Air Force airfield in England, was built. The airfield itself was used in the immediate postwar period as a dump for soon-to-be-scrapped fighters and bombers, and was used for the penultimate scene in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; when Dana Andrews relives his wartime experiences and goes on to rebuild his life.

<text>Verbena Trágica (Tragic Festival, also known as Block Party) is a 1939 film directed by Charles Lamont. The film was made in 1938 in the Spanish language only, unusual for the time but most likely due to the film&#x27;s themes of adultery and revenge.

In 1996, the film was deemed to be &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
On the eve of Columbus Day festivities in New York, the boxer Mateo Vargas is released early from a jail term he served after he struck a police officer. He returns home for a surprise reunion with his family, but his wife Blanca faints. Mateo learns from her doctor that she is pregnant. Mateo is shocked, and knows that he cannot be the father. His trainer wants him to return to the boxing ring, but Mateo is too preoccupied with Blanca&#x27;s infidelity. While he was in jail, Blanca had been seeing Claudio, the fiancé of Mateo&#x27;s sister Lola. When Lola tells her suspicions to her mother, she slaps Lola. Vargas confronts Blanca about her pregnancy, but she refuses to name the father. Mateo becomes obsessed with finding his wife&#x27;s lover.

In contrast, a longitudinal wave travels in the direction of its oscillations. All waves move energy from place to place without transporting the matter in the transmission medium if there is one. Electromagnetic waves are transverse without requiring a medium. The designation “transverse” indicates the direction of the wave is perpendicular to the displacement of the particles of the medium through which it passes, or in the case of EM waves, the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of the wave.

A simple example is given by the waves that can be created on a horizontal length of string by anchoring one end and moving the other end up and down. Another example is the waves that are created on the membrane of a drum. The waves propagate in directions that are parallel to the membrane plane, but each point in the membrane itself gets displaced up and down, perpendicular to that plane. Light is another example of a transverse wave, where the oscillations are the electric and magnetic fields, which point at right angles to the ideal light rays that describe the direction of propagation.

Transverse waves commonly occur in elastic solids due to the shear stress generated; the oscillations in this case are the displacement of the solid particles away from their relaxed position, in directions perpendicular to the propagation of the wave. These displacements correspond to a local shear deformation of the material. Hence a transverse wave of this nature is called a shear wave. Since fluids cannot resist shear forces while at rest, propagation of transverse waves inside the bulk of fluids is not possible. In seismology, shear waves are also called secondary waves or S-waves.

Transverse waves are contrasted with longitudinal waves, where the oscillations occur in the direction of the wave. The standard example of a longitudinal wave is a sound wave or &quot;pressure wave&quot; in gases, liquids, or solids, whose oscillations cause compression and expansion of the material through which the wave is propagating. Pressure waves are called &quot;primary waves&quot;, or &quot;P-waves&quot; in geophysics.

Water waves involve both longitudinal and transverse motions.

==Mathematical formulation==
Mathematically, the simplest kind of transverse wave is a plane linearly polarized sinusoidal one. &quot;Plane&quot; here means that the direction of propagation is unchanging and the same over the whole medium; &quot;linearly polarized&quot; means that the direction of displacement too is unchanging and the same over the whole medium; and the magnitude of the displacement is a sinusoidal function only of time and of position along the direction of propagation.

The motion of such a wave can be expressed mathematically as follows. Let formula_1 be the direction of propagation (a vector with unit length), and formula_2 any reference point in the medium. Let formula_3 be the direction of the oscillations (another unit-length vector perpendicular to &quot;d&quot;). The displacement of a particle at any point formula_4 of the medium and any time &quot;t&quot; (seconds) will be
formula_5
where &quot;A&quot; is the wave&#x27;s amplitude or strength, &quot;T&quot; is its period, &quot;v&quot; is the speed of propagation, and formula_6 is its phase at t = 0 seconds at formula_2. All these parameters are real numbers. The symbol &quot;•&quot; denotes the inner product of two vectors.

By this equation, the wave travels in the direction formula_1 and the oscillations occur back and forth along the direction formula_3. The wave is said to be linearly polarized in the direction formula_3.

An observer that looks at a fixed point formula_4 will see the particle there move in a simple harmonic (sinusoidal) motion with period &quot;T&quot; seconds, with maximum particle displacement &quot;A&quot; in each sense; that is, with a frequency of &quot;f&quot; = 1/&quot;T&quot; full oscillation cycles every second. A snapshot of all particles at a fixed time &quot;t&quot; will show the same displacement for all particles on each plane perpendicular to formula_1, with the displacements in successive planes forming a sinusoidal pattern, with each full cycle extending along formula_1 by the wavelength &quot;λ&quot; = &quot;v&quot; &quot;T&quot; = &quot;v&quot;/&quot;f&quot;. The whole pattern moves in the direction formula_1with speed &quot;V&quot;.

The same equation describes a plane linearly polarized sinusoidal light wave, except that the &quot;displacement&quot; &quot;S&quot;(formula_4, &quot;t&quot;) is the electric field at point formula_4 and time &quot;t&quot;. (The magnetic field will be described by the same equation, but with a &quot;displacement&quot; direction that is perpendicular to both formula_1 and formula_3, and a different amplitude.)

===Superposition principle===
In a homogeneous linear medium, complex oscillations (vibrations in a material or light flows) can be described as the superposition of many simple sinusoidal waves, either transverse or longitudinal.

The vibrations of a violin string create standing waves, for example, which can be analyzed as the sum of many transverse waves of different frequencies moving in opposite directions to each other, that displace the string either up or down or left to right. The antinodes of the waves align in a superposition .

=== Circular polarization === 
If the medium is linear and allows multiple independent displacement directions for the same travel direction formula_1, we can choose two mutually perpendicular directions of polarization, and express any wave linearly polarized in any other direction as a linear combination (mixing) of those two waves.

By combining two waves with same frequency, velocity, and direction of travel, but with different phases and independent displacement directions, one obtains a circularly or elliptically polarized wave. In such a wave the particles describe circular or elliptical trajectories, instead of moving back and forth.

It may help understanding to revisit the thought experiment with a taut string mentioned above. Notice that you can also launch waves on the string by moving your hand to the right and left instead of up and down. This is an important point. There are two independent (orthogonal) directions that the waves can move. (This is true for any two directions at right angles, up and down and right and left are chosen for clarity.) Any waves launched by moving your hand in a straight line are linearly polarized waves.

But now imagine moving your hand in a circle. Your motion will launch a spiral wave on the string. You are moving your hand simultaneously both up and down and side to side. The maxima of the side to side motion occur a quarter wavelength (or a quarter of a way around the circle, that is 90 degrees or π/2 radians) from the maxima of the up and down motion. At any point along the string, the displacement of the string will describe the same circle as your hand, but delayed by the propagation speed of the wave. Notice also that you can choose to move your hand in a clockwise circle or a counter-clockwise circle. These alternate circular motions produce right and left circularly polarized waves.

To the extent your circle is imperfect, a regular motion will describe an ellipse, and produce elliptically polarized waves. At the extreme of eccentricity your ellipse will become a straight line, producing linear polarization along the major axis of the ellipse. An elliptical motion can always be decomposed into two orthogonal linear motions of unequal amplitude and 90 degrees out of phase, with circular polarization being the special case where the two linear motions have the same amplitude.


=== Power in a transverse wave in string ===
(Let the linear mass density of the string be μ.)

The kinetic energy of a mass element in a transverse wave is given by:
formula_20

In one wavelength, kinetic energy
formula_21

Using Hooke&#x27;s law the potential energy in mass element
formula_22

And the potential energy for one wavelength
formula_23

So, total energy in one wavelength formula_24

Therefore average power is formula_25

<text>Johann Silvio Gesell (; 17 March 1862 – 11 March 1930) was a German-Argentine economist, merchant, and the founder of , an economic model for market socialism. In 1900 he founded the magazine &quot;Geld-und Bodenreform&quot; (&quot;Monetary and Land Reform&quot;), but it soon closed for financial reasons. During one of his stays in Argentina, where he lived in a vegetarian commune, Gesell started the magazine &quot;Der Physiokrat&quot; together with Georg Blumenthal. In 1914, it closed due to censorship.

The Bavarian Soviet Republic, in which he participated, had a violent end and Gesell was detained for several months on a charge of treason, but was acquitted by a Munich court after a speech he gave in his own defense.

==Life==
Silvio Gesell&#x27;s mother was Walloon and his father was German, originally from Aachen, who worked as a clerk in the then-Prussian district of Malmedy, now part of Belgium. Silvio was the seventh of nine children.

After visiting the public Bürgerschule in Sankt Vith, he attended Gymnasium in Malmedy. Being forced to pay for his living expenses from an early age, he decided against attending a university and worked for the &quot;Deutsche Reichspost&quot;, the postal system of the German Empire. Dissatisfied, he began an apprenticeship to his merchant brother in Berlin. Then he lived in Málaga, Spain for two years, working as a correspondent. He then returned to Berlin involuntarily to complete his military service. After this, he worked as a merchant in Brunswick and Hamburg.

In 1887, Gesell relocated to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he opened a franchise of his brother&#x27;s business. The 1890 depression in Argentina, which hurt his business considerably, caused him to think about the structural problems caused by the monetary system. In 1891, he released his first writing on this topic: &quot;Die Reformation des Münzwesens als Brücke zum sozialen Staat&quot; (&quot;The Reformation of the Monetary System as a Bridge to a Social State&quot;). He then wrote &quot;Nervus Rerum&quot; and &quot;The Nationalization of Money&quot;. He gave his business to his brother and returned to Europe in 1892.

After a stay in Germany, Gesell relocated to Les Hauts-Geneveys in the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel. There he completed his self-taught education by reading the works of the most important economists, trying to contrast their monetary theories. Judging by the quotations, he read David Hume, Adam Smith, David Ricardo, Marx, Proudhon, Henry George, Wicksell, Böhm-Bawerk, Carl Menger, Knapp, John Law. In 1900, he created the magazine &quot;Geld- und Bodenreform&quot; (&quot;Monetary and Land Reform&quot;), but it failed in 1903 for financial reasons.

From 1907 to 1911, Gesell was in Argentina again, then he returned to Germany and lived in the vegetarian commune &quot;Obstbausiedlung Eden&quot;, which was founded by Franz Oppenheimer in Oranienburg, north of Berlin. There, he founded the magazine &quot;Der Physiokrat&quot; together with Georg Blumenthal. It folded in 1914 due to censorship as World War I began.

In 1915, Gesell left Germany to return to his farm in Les Hauts-Geneveys. In 1919, he was asked to join the Bavarian Soviet Republic by Ernst Niekisch. The republic offered him a seat on the Socialization Commission and then appointed him the People&#x27;s Representative for Finances. Gesell chose the Swiss mathematician Theophil Christen and the economist Ernst Polenske as his assistants and immediately wrote a law for the creation of Freigeld, a currency system he had developed. His term of office lasted only seven days. After the violent end of the Bavarian Soviet Republic, Gesell was detained for several months until being acquitted of treason by a Munich court. He claimed that he didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the political decisions of the Republic and was just trying to offer a plan to restructure the economy. Because of his participation with the Soviet Republic, Switzerland denied him return to his farm in Neuchâtel.

Gesell then relocated first to Nuthetal, Potsdam-Mittelmark, then back to Oranienburg. After another brief stay in Argentina during 1924, he returned to Oranienburg in 1927. There, he died of pneumonia on 11 March 1930.

He promoted his ideas in German and in Spanish.

Villa Gesell, a seaside town in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina was founded by his son, Don Carlos Idaho Gesell, who named it after his father.

==Economic philosophy==
Gesell considered himself a world citizen and was inspired by Henry George to believe that the earth should belong to all people, regardless of race, class, wealth, religion, or age, and that borders should be made obsolete. But his land reform proposal was different from Georgism. He believed that taxes could not solve the problem of rent on land, as taxes could be transferred to tenants. He thought we must abolish the private ownership of land and put free-land reform, a sort of public lease of land, into effect.

According to Silvio Gesell, it is not effective to establish welfare systems without abolishing private ownership of land, because the proceeds of the labor of workers are determined by the proceeds of labor that they can obtain on free land. The benefits gained by the welfare system are not to increase the proceeds of labor that workers can obtain on free land, but rather to increase the proceeds of labor that they can obtain on the lands of landowners. Private ownership of land converts all the advantages of using one&#x27;s land into cash and it belongs to the landowner. In order not to cancel the effects of welfare policies, Silvio Gesell believed that Free-Land reform was needed.

Gesell based his economic thought on the self-interest of individuals, which he saw as a &quot;natural&quot; and healthy motive, in satisfying their needs and being productive. Gesell believed that an economic system must do justice to individual proclivities; otherwise the system would fail. He believed that this stance put him in opposition to Marxism, which, Gesell considered, proposed an economic system that was against human nature.

Believing that the talent and selfishness of individuals must be taken into account, Gesell called for free, fair business competition, with equal chances for all. This included the removal of all legal and inherited privilege. Everyone should rely only on their abilities to make a living. In the &quot;natural economic order&quot; which Gesell recommended, the most talented people would have the greatest income, without distortion by interest and rent charges. The economic status of the less-talented would improve because they would not be forced to pay interest and rent charges. According to Gesell, this would result in less difference between the poor and the rich. Furthermore, greater average incomes would mean that the poor would have a greater chance of escaping poverty, in part because other poor people would have greater disposable income and spending power.

Some regard Gesell&#x27;s idea as a negative interest rate policy. The difference between them is that, with the free-money reforms of Gesell, hoarding money becomes impossible because the face-value of money is depreciated regularly. This forces the circulation of money. With negative interest, on the contrary, there is the possibility of hoarding money, because the face value of money is constant and people can use their money as a means of saving. For example, Japan&#x27;s negative interest rates drove up the sales of safes and strongboxes.

Gesell denied value theory in economics. He thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science, and that a currency administration guided by value theory was doomed to sterility and inactivity.

<text> (German for &quot;free economy&quot;) is an economic idea founded by Silvio Gesell in 1916. He called it &quot; (natural economic order). In 1932, a group of Swiss businessmen used his ideas to found the WIR Bank (WIR).

==Structure==
Freiwirtschaft consists of three central aspects, usually summed up as the Three Fs:
* &quot; (free money)
** All money is issued for a &quot;limited&quot; period by &quot;constant&quot; value (neither inflation, nor deflation).
** Long-term saving requires investment in bonds or stocks.
* &quot;&quot; (free land)
** All land is commonly owned or else the property of public institutions and can only be rented from the community or from government, respectively, not purchased (&quot;see also Georgism&quot;).
* &quot;&quot; (free trade)
**Unrestrained free trade supported by an international currency union as paper standard to maintain stable exchange rates and abolition of the gold standard in foreign trade.

== History ==
The basic economic ideas of Freiwirtschaft were published in 1890 by the Hungarian-Austrian economist Theodor Hertzka in his novel &quot;Freiland - ein soziales Zukunftsbild&quot; (&quot;Freeland - A Social Anticipation&quot;).

== Flaws of the monetary system ==
Freiwirtschaft claims that current monetary systems are flawed. In mainstream economics, prices convey information. For example, dropping prices on a product mean that there is less demand or more supply of that product. This leads to a buyer&#x27;s buying more, or a seller&#x27;s/producer&#x27;s starting to sell/produce something else, thereby reducing the supply of that product. As a reaction, assuming constant desirability, the price of the product rises again. So, the price, together with the market participants, builds up a feedback loop around a stable, &quot;ideal&quot; price. At this stable price, the market is ideal, no one pays too much or earns too little, and there are no tendencies from either party to change that price. The &quot;wobbling&quot; around that ideal price is called &quot;self-stabilizing&quot;.

The key error of the current system, according to Gesell, is the ill-transported information in the price. Money is nothing but a claim for goods and services, usable in the economies that accept money in exchange for the former. In a weak economy, money is worth less in goods. But instead of an inflation, the result is a deflation as described above, and less money can now buy the same goods. This feedback loop is &quot;self-destabilizing&quot;, according to the Freiwirtschaft theory.

<text>Ç or ç (C-cedilla) is a Latin script letter used in the Albanian, Azerbaijani, Manx, Tatar, Turkish, Turkmen, Kurdish, Kazakh, and Romance alphabets. Romance languages that use this letter include Catalan, French, Portuguese, and Occitan, as a variant of the letter &quot;C&quot; with a cedilla. It is also occasionally used in Crimean Tatar and in Tajik (when written in the Latin script) to represent the sound. It is rarely used in Balinese, usually only in the word &quot;Çaka&quot; during Nyepi, one of the Balinese Hinduism holidays. It is often retained in the spelling of loanwords from any of these languages in English, Basque, Dutch, Spanish and other languages using the Latin alphabet.

It was first used for the sound of the voiceless alveolar affricate in Old Spanish and stems from the Visigothic form of the letter &quot;z&quot; (&quot;Ꝣ&quot;). The phoneme originated in Vulgar Latin from the palatalization of the plosives and in some conditions. Later, changed into in many Romance languages and dialects. Spanish has not used the symbol since an orthographic reform in the 18th century (which replaced &quot;ç&quot; with the now-devoiced &quot;z&quot;), but it was adopted for writing other languages.

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, represents the voiceless palatal fricative.

==Usage as a letter variant in various languages==

In many languages, represents the &quot;soft&quot; sound where a would normally represent the &quot;hard&quot; sound . These include:
*Catalan. Known as &quot;ce trencada&quot; (&#x27;broken C&#x27;) in this language, where it can be used before , , or at the end of a word. Some examples of words with are &quot;amenaça&quot; (&#x27;menace&#x27;), &quot;torçat&quot; (&#x27;twisted&#x27;), &quot;xoriço&quot; (&#x27;chorizo&#x27;), &quot;forçut&quot; (&#x27;strong&#x27;), &quot;dolç&quot; (&#x27;sweet&#x27;) and &quot;caça&quot; (&#x27;hunting&#x27;). The only two words starting with &quot;ç&quot; that can be found in the dictionary are &quot;ço&quot; (&#x27;this&#x27;) and &quot;ça&quot; (&#x27;here&#x27;), which are rarely used, except for some expressions like &quot;ço que&quot; (&#x27;which&#x27;). A well-known word with this character is &quot;Barça&quot;, a common Catalan clipping of Futbol Club Barcelona. When writing by hand, Catalans don&#x27;t write &quot;ç&quot; with a cedilla under it, but a symbol similar to a comma, which crosses the &quot;c&quot; (called &quot;trenc&quot;). In fact, some scholars like Jesús Alturo claim that &quot;ce trencada&quot; evolved from combining &quot;c&quot; and &quot;i&quot; (written ci) instead of the letter &quot;z&quot;.
*French (&quot;cé cédille&quot;): &quot;français&quot; (&#x27;French&#x27;), &quot;garçon&quot; (&#x27;boy&#x27;), &quot;façade&quot; (&#x27;frontage&#x27;), &quot;grinçant&quot; (&#x27;squeaking&#x27;), &quot;leçon&quot; (&#x27;lesson&#x27;), &quot;reçu&quot; (&#x27;received&#x27; [past participle]). French does not use the character at the end of a word but it can occur at the beginning of a word (e.g., &quot;ça&quot;, &#x27;that&#x27;). It is never used in French where C would denote /s/ (before e, i, y) nor before h.
*Occitan (&quot;ce cedilha&quot;): &quot;torçut&quot; (&#x27;twisted&#x27;), &quot;çò&quot; (&#x27;this&#x27;), &quot;ça que la&quot; (&#x27;nevertheless&#x27;), &quot;braç&quot; (&#x27;arm&#x27;), &quot;brèç&quot; (&#x27;cradle&#x27;), &quot;voraç&quot; (&#x27;voracious&#x27;). It can occur at the beginning or end of words.
*Portuguese (&quot;cê-cedilha&quot;, &quot;cê de cedilha&quot; or &quot;cê cedilhado&quot;): it is used before , , : &quot;taça&quot; (&#x27;cup&#x27;), &quot;braço&quot; (&#x27;arm&#x27;), &quot;açúcar&quot; (&#x27;sugar&#x27;). Modern Portuguese does not use the character at the beginning or at the end of a word (the nickname for &quot;Conceição&quot; is &quot;São&quot;, not &quot;Ção&quot;). According to a Portuguese grammar written in 1550, the letter ç had the sound of /dz/ around that time. Another grammar written around 1700 would say that the letter ç sounds like /s/, which shows a phonetic evolution that is still valid today.
*Old Galician used the ç letter, however it is no longer present in the official norm for the Galician language by the Royal Galician Academy. However, the unofficial norm for the Galician language by the AGAL reclaims the ç as part of the language.
*Old Spanish used ç to represent /t͡s/.
*Early Modern Spanish used the letter ç to represent either /θ/ or /s/ before /a/, /o/, and /u/ in much the same way as Modern Spanish uses the letter z. Middle Castilian Spanish pronounced ç as /θ/. Andalusian, Canarian, and Latin American Spanish pronounced ç as /s/. A spelling reform in the 18th century eliminated ç from Spanish orthography.

In other languages, it represents the voiceless postalveolar affricate (like in English &quot;chalk&quot;):
*Albanian
*Turkish
*Friulian (&quot;c cun cedilie&quot;) before , , or at the end of a word.

*Balinese Ç usually used to commemorate the Nyepi holiday only used in the word &#x27;Çaka&#x27;, for example:
&quot;Selamat Hari Raya Nyepi tahun Çaka 1945&quot;
(Happy Nyepi Day in Çaka 1945)&lt;br&gt;The pronunciation is similar to the slavic S.

* In Manx it is used in the digraph , which also represents , to differentiate it from normal , which represents .

===In loanwords only===
*In Basque, (known as &quot;ze hautsia&quot;) is used in the loanword &quot;Curaçao&quot;.
*In Dutch, it can be found in some words from French and Portuguese, such as &quot;façade&quot;, &quot;reçu&quot;, &quot;Provençaals&quot; and &quot;Curaçao&quot;.
*In English, is used in loanwords such as &quot;façade&quot; and &quot;limaçon&quot; (although the cedilla mark is often dropped: , ).

==As a separate letter in various languages==
It represents the voiceless postalveolar affricate in the following languages:

*the 4th letter of the Albanian alphabet.
*the 4th letter of the Azerbaijani alphabet.
*the 4th letter of the Dobrujan Tatar alphabet.
*the 4th letter of the Turkish alphabet.
*the 3rd letter of the Turkmen alphabet.
*the 4th letter of the Kurmanji alphabet (also known as Northern Kurdish).
*the 4th letter of the Zazaki alphabet.

In the 2020 version of the Latin Kazakh Alphabet, the letter represents the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate , which is similar to .

It previously represented a voiceless palatal click in Juǀʼhoansi and Naro, though the former has replaced it with and the latter with .

The similarly shaped letter the (Ҫ ҫ) is used in the Cyrillic alphabets of Bashkir and Chuvash to represent and , respectively.

In Tatar, ç represents .

It also represents the retroflex flap in the Rohingya Latin alphabet.

Janalif uses this letter to represent the voiced postalveolar affricate 

Old Malay uses ç to represent and .

==Computer==
===Input===

On Albanian, Belgian, European French, Portuguese, Spanish, Swiss, Turkish and Italian keyboards, is directly available as a separate key; however, on most other keyboards, including the US and British keyboard, a combination of keys must be used:

*In the US-International keyboard layout, these are followed by either or . Alternatively one may press or . The Canadian French layout has a dedicated dead key in the spot of the key.
*In classic Mac OS and macOS, these are and for lower- and uppercase, respectively.
*In the X Window System and many Unix consoles, one presses sequentially , and either or . Alternatively, one may press and then either or .
*In Microsoft Windows, these are or for lowercase and or for uppercase.
*In Microsoft Word, these are and then either or .
*The HTML character entity references are codice_1 and codice_2 for lower- and uppercase, respectively.
*In TeX and LaTeX, codice_3 is used for adding the cedilla accent to a letter, so codice_4 produces &quot;ç&quot;.

<doc id="76416" wikidata="Q17103352" url="?curid=76416" title="Maximum power transfer theorem">
<text>In electrical engineering, the maximum power transfer theorem states that, to obtain &quot;maximum&quot; external power from a power source with internal resistance, the resistance of the load must equal the resistance of the source as viewed from its output terminals. Moritz von Jacobi published the maximum power (transfer) theorem around 1840; it is also referred to as &quot;Jacobi&#x27;s law&quot;.

The theorem results in maximum &quot;power&quot; transfer from the power source to the load, but not maximum &quot;efficiency&quot; of useful power out of total power consumed. If the load resistance is made larger than the source resistance, then efficiency increases (since a higher percentage of the source power is transferred to the load), but the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the load power decreases (since the total circuit resistance increases). If the load resistance is made smaller than the source resistance, then efficiency decreases (since most of the power ends up being dissipated in the source). Although the total power dissipated increases (due to a lower total resistance), the amount dissipated in the load decreases.

The theorem states how to choose (so as to maximize power transfer) the load resistance, once the source resistance is given. It is a common misconception to apply the theorem in the opposite scenario. It does &quot;not&quot; say how to choose the source resistance for a given load resistance. In fact, the source resistance that maximizes power transfer from a voltage source is always zero (the hypothetical ideal voltage source), regardless of the value of the load resistance.

The theorem can be extended to alternating current circuits that include reactance, and states that maximum power transfer occurs when the load impedance is equal to the complex conjugate of the source impedance.

The mathematics of the theorem also applies to other physical interactions, such as:

* mechanical collisions between two objects, 
* the sharing of charge between two capacitors, 
* liquid flow between two cylinders,
* the transmission and reflection of light at the boundary between two media.

== Maximizing power transfer versus power efficiency ==

The theorem was originally misunderstood (notably by Joule) to imply that a system consisting of an electric motor driven by a battery could not be more than 50% efficient, since the power dissipated as heat in the battery would always be equal to the power delivered to the motor when the impedances were matched. 

In 1880 this assumption was shown to be false by either Edison or his colleague Francis Robbins Upton, who realized that maximum efficiency was not the same as maximum power transfer. 

To achieve maximum efficiency, the resistance of the source (whether a battery or a dynamo) could be (or should be) made as close to zero as possible. Using this new understanding, they obtained an efficiency of about 90%, and proved that the electric motor was a practical alternative to the heat engine.
The efficiency is the ratio of the power dissipated by the load resistance to the total power dissipated by the circuit (which includes the voltage source&#x27;s resistance of as well as ):

formula_1

Consider three particular cases (note that voltage sources must have some resistance):
* If formula_2, then formula_3 Efficiency approaches 0% if the load resistance approaches zero (a short circuit), since all power is consumed in the source and no power is consumed in the short.
* If formula_4, then formula_5 Efficiency is only 50% if the load resistance equals the source resistance (which is the condition of maximum power transfer).
* If formula_6, then formula_7 Efficiency approaches 100% if the load resistance approaches infinity (though the total power level tends towards zero) or if the source resistance approaches zero. Using a large ratio is called impedance bridging.

==Impedance matching==

A related concept is reflectionless impedance matching. 

In radio frequency transmission lines, and other electronics, there is often a requirement to match the source impedance (at the transmitter) to the load impedance (such as an antenna) to avoid reflections in the transmission line.

== Calculus-based proof for purely resistive circuits ==
In the simplified model of powering a load with resistance by a source with voltage and source resistance , then by Ohm&#x27;s law the resulting current is simply the source voltage divided by the total circuit resistance:
formula_8

The power dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistance:
formula_9

The value of for which this expression is a maximum could be calculated by differentiating it, but it is easier to calculate the value of for which the denominator:
formula_10
is a minimum. The result will be the same in either case. Differentiating the denominator with respect to :
formula_11

For a maximum or minimum, the first derivative is zero, so
formula_12
or
formula_13

In practical resistive circuits, and are both positive, so the positive sign in the above is the correct solution. 

To find out whether this solution is a minimum or a maximum, the denominator expression is differentiated again:

formula_14

This is always positive for positive values of formula_15 and formula_16, showing that the denominator is a minimum, and the power is therefore a maximum, when:
formula_17

The above proof assumes fixed source resistance formula_15. When the source resistance can be varied, power transferred to the load can be increased by reducing formula_19. For example, a 100 Volt source with an formula_19 of formula_21 will deliver 250 watts of power to a formula_21 load; reducing formula_19 to formula_24 increases the power delivered to 1000 watts.

Note that this shows that maximum power transfer can also be interpreted as the load voltage being equal to one-half of the Thevenin voltage equivalent of the source.

==In reactive circuits==
The power transfer theorem also applies when the source and/or load are not purely resistive. 

A refinement of the maximum power theorem says that any reactive components of source and load should be of equal magnitude but opposite sign. (&quot;See below for a derivation.&quot;) 
* This means that the source and load impedances should be &quot;complex conjugates&quot; of each other. 
* In the case of purely resistive circuits, the two concepts are identical. 

Physically realizable sources and loads are not usually purely resistive, having some inductive or capacitive components, and so practical applications of this theorem, under the name of complex conjugate impedance matching, do, in fact, exist.

If the source is totally inductive (capacitive), then a totally capacitive (inductive) load, in the absence of resistive losses, would receive 100% of the energy from the source but send it back after a quarter cycle.

The resultant circuit is nothing other than a resonant LC circuit in which the energy continues to oscillate to and fro. This oscillation is called reactive power. 

Power factor correction (where an inductive reactance is used to &quot;balance out&quot; a capacitive one), is essentially the same idea as complex conjugate impedance matching although it is done for entirely different reasons.

For a fixed reactive &quot;source&quot;, the maximum power theorem maximizes the real power (P) delivered to the load by complex conjugate matching the load to the source.

For a fixed reactive &quot;load&quot;, power factor correction minimizes the apparent power (S) (and unnecessary current) conducted by the transmission lines, while maintaining the same amount of real power transfer. 

This is done by adding a reactance to the load to balance out the load&#x27;s own reactance, changing the reactive load impedance into a resistive load impedance.

=== Proof ===

In this diagram, AC power is being transferred from the source, with phasor magnitude of voltage formula_25 (positive peak voltage) and fixed source impedance formula_26 (S for source), to a load with impedance formula_27 (L for load), resulting in a (positive) magnitude formula_28 of the current phasor formula_29. This magnitude formula_28 results from dividing the magnitude of the source voltage by the magnitude of the total circuit impedance:
formula_31

The average power formula_32 dissipated in the load is the square of the current multiplied by the resistive portion (the real part) formula_33 of the load impedance formula_27:
formula_35
where formula_36 and formula_33 denote the resistances, that is the real parts, and formula_38 and formula_39 denote the reactances, that is the imaginary parts, of respectively the source and load impedances formula_26 and formula_27.

To determine, for a given source, the voltage formula_42 and the impedance formula_43 the value of the load impedance formula_44 for which this expression for the power yields a maximum, one first finds, for each fixed positive value of formula_33, the value of the reactive term formula_39 for which the denominator:
formula_47
is a minimum. Since reactances can be negative, this is achieved by adapting the load reactance to:
formula_48

This reduces the above equation to:
formula_49
and it remains to find the value of formula_33 which maximizes this expression. This problem has the same form as in the purely resistive case, and the maximizing condition therefore is formula_51

The two maximizing conditions:

*formula_52
*formula_53

describe the complex conjugate of the source impedance, denoted by formula_54 and thus can be concisely combined to:
formula_55

<text>As part of the theory of Freiwirtschaft, Freigeld (&#x27;free money&#x27;, ) is a monetary (or exchange) unit proposed by Silvio Gesell.

== Properties ==

Freigeld has several special properties:

* It is maintained by a monetary authority to be &quot;spending-power stable&quot; (no inflation or deflation) by means of printing more money or withdrawing money from circulation.
* It is &quot;cash flow safe&quot; (a scheme is put in place to ensure that the money is returned into the cash flow – for example, by demurrage – requiring stamps to be purchased and periodically attached to the money to keep it valid).
* It is convertible into other currencies.
* It is localized to a certain area (it is a local currency).

The name results from the idea that there is no incentive to store or hoard Freigeld as it will automatically lose its value after some time. It is claimed that as a result, interest rates could decrease to zero.

== Theory ==

According to Gesell, all human-produced goods are subject to expensive storage, whereas money is not: grain loses its weight, metal products rust, housing deteriorates. Therefore, money has a supreme advantage over all other goods. John Maynard Keynes renamed the concept of &quot;basic interest&quot; articulated in Gesell&#x27;s book &quot;The Natural Economic Order&quot; with the more familiar term liquidity preference. Being &quot;liquid&quot; – having money – is a great advantage to anybody, much more so than having comparable amounts (past utility) of any product. The result is that people will not even provide zero-risk, inflation-corrected credits unless a certain interest rate is offered. &quot;Freigeld&quot; simply reduces this &quot;primordial&quot; interest rate, which is estimated to be somewhere around 3% to 5%, by an absolute, in order to lower the average interest rate to a value around 0.

== Examples ==

E-gold was an example of a modern private currency in which demurrage is applied. In this case there was a gold storage charge of 1% per annum. The demurrage associated with e-gold is arguably expended by the currency operator to help cover real storage costs.

Bernard Lietaer&#x27;s terra is a commodity basket currency proposal similar to Keynes&#x27;s bancor or L&#x27;Europa (The idea to establish a L&#x27;Europa – monnaie de la paix from early concepts presented in an article in the French newspaper Le Fédériste on 1 January 1933) and bearing a demurrage charge.

The chiemgauer is a regional community currency in a part of Bavaria, using a demurrage system.

==In fiction==
Michael Ende has stated to have had the concept of aging money in mind when writing his children&#x27;s novel &quot;Momo&quot;.

<text>A Kater&#x27;s pendulum is a reversible free swinging pendulum invented by British physicist and army captain Henry Kater in 1817 (made public on 29 January 1818), for use as a gravimeter instrument to measure the local acceleration of gravity. Its advantage is that, unlike previous pendulum gravimeters, the pendulum&#x27;s centre of gravity and center of oscillation do not have to be determined, allowing a greater accuracy. For about a century, until the 1930s, Kater&#x27;s pendulum and its various refinements remained the standard method for measuring the strength of the Earth&#x27;s gravity during geodetic surveys. It is now used only for demonstrating pendulum principles.

==Description==
A pendulum can be used to measure the acceleration of gravity &quot;g&quot; because for narrow swings its period of swing &quot;T&quot; depends only on &quot;g&quot; and its length &quot;L&quot;:

:formula_1

So by measuring the length &quot;L&quot; and period &quot;T&quot; of a pendulum, &quot;g&quot; can be calculated.

The Kater&#x27;s pendulum consists of a rigid metal bar with two pivot points, one near each end of the bar. It can be suspended from either pivot and swung. It also has either an adjustable weight that can be moved up and down the bar, or one adjustable pivot, to adjust the periods of swing. In use, it is swung from one pivot, and the period timed, and then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the period timed. The movable weight (or pivot) is adjusted until the two periods are equal. At this point the period &quot;T&quot; is equal to the period of an &#x27;ideal&#x27; simple pendulum of length equal to the distance between the pivots. From the period and the measured distance &quot;L&quot; between the pivots, the acceleration of gravity can be calculated with great precision from the equation (1) above.

The acceleration due to gravity by Kater&#x27;s pendulum is given by:

:formula_2

where &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2 are the time periods of oscillations when it is suspended from &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;2 respectively and &quot;ℓ&quot;1 and &quot;ℓ&quot;2 are the distances of knife edges &quot;K&quot;1 and &quot;K&quot;2 from the center of gravity respectively.

==History==
===Gravity measurement with pendulums===
The first person to discover that gravity varied over the Earth&#x27;s surface was French scientist Jean Richer, who in 1671 was sent on an expedition to Cayenne, French Guiana, by the French Académie des Sciences, assigned the task of making measurements with a pendulum clock. Through the observations he made in the following year, Richer determined that the clock was minutes per day slower than at Paris, or equivalently the length of a pendulum with a swing of one second there was Paris &quot;lines&quot;, or 2.6 mm, shorter than at Paris. It was realized by the scientists of the day, and proven by Isaac Newton in 1687, that this was due to the fact that the Earth was not a perfect sphere but slightly oblate; it was thicker at the equator because of the Earth&#x27;s rotation. Since the surface was farther from the Earth&#x27;s center at Cayenne than at Paris, gravity was weaker there. After that discovery was made, freeswinging pendulums started to be used as precision gravimeters, taken on voyages to different parts of the world to measure the local gravitational acceleration. The accumulation of geographical gravity data resulted in more and more accurate models of the overall shape of the Earth.

Pendulums were so universally used to measure gravity that, in Kater&#x27;s time, the local strength of gravity was usually expressed not by the value of the acceleration &quot;g&quot; now used, but by the length at that location of the &quot;seconds pendulum&quot;, a pendulum with a period of two seconds, so each swing takes one second. It can be seen from equation (1) that for a seconds pendulum, the length is simply proportional to &quot;g&quot;:

:formula_3

===Inaccuracy of gravimeter pendulums===
In Kater&#x27;s time, the period &quot;T&quot; of pendulums could be measured very precisely by timing them with precision clocks set by the passage of stars overhead. Prior to Kater&#x27;s discovery, the accuracy of &quot;g&quot; measurements was limited by the difficulty of measuring the other factor &quot;L&quot;, the length of the pendulum, accurately. &quot;L&quot; in equation (1) above was the length of an ideal mathematical &#x27;simple pendulum&#x27; consisting of a point mass swinging on the end of a massless cord. However the &#x27;length&#x27; of a real pendulum, a swinging rigid body, known in mechanics as a compound pendulum, is more difficult to define. In 1673 Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens in his mathematical analysis of pendulums, &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;, showed that a real pendulum had the same period as a simple pendulum with a length equal to the distance between the pivot point and a point called the &quot;center of oscillation&quot;, which is located under the pendulum&#x27;s center of gravity and depends on the mass distribution along the length of the pendulum. The problem was there was no way to find the location of the center of oscillation in a real pendulum accurately. It could theoretically be calculated from the shape of the pendulum if the metal parts had uniform density, but the metallurgical quality and mathematical abilities of the time didn&#x27;t allow the calculation to be made accurately.

To get around this problem, most early gravity researchers, such as Jean Picard (1669), Charles Marie de la Condamine (1735), and Jean-Charles de Borda (1792) approximated a simple pendulum by using a metal sphere suspended by a light wire. If the wire had negligible mass, the center of oscillation was close to the center of gravity of the sphere. But even finding the center of gravity of the sphere accurately was difficult. In addition, this type of pendulum inherently wasn&#x27;t very accurate. The sphere and wire didn&#x27;t swing back and forth as a rigid unit, because the sphere acquired a slight angular momentum during each swing. Also the wire stretched elastically during the pendulum&#x27;s swing, changing &quot;L&quot; slightly during the cycle.

===Kater&#x27;s solution===
However, in &quot;Horologium Oscillatorium&quot;, Huygens had also proved that the pivot point and the center of oscillation were interchangeable. That is, if any pendulum is suspended upside down from its center of oscillation, it has the same period of swing, and the new center of oscillation is the old pivot point. The distance between these two conjugate points was equal to the length of a simple pendulum with the same period.

As part of a committee appointed by the Royal Society in 1816 to reform British measures, Kater had been contracted by the House of Commons to determine accurately the length of the seconds pendulum in London. He realized Huygens&#x27; principle could be used to find the center of oscillation, and so the length &quot;L&quot;, of a rigid (compound) pendulum. If a pendulum were hung upside down from a second pivot point that could be adjusted up and down on the pendulum&#x27;s rod, and the second pivot were adjusted until the pendulum had the same period as it did when swinging right side up from the first pivot, the second pivot would be at the center of oscillation, and the distance between the two pivot points would be &quot;L&quot;.
Kater was not the first to have this idea. French mathematician Gaspard de Prony first proposed a reversible pendulum in 1800, but his work was not published until 1889. In 1811 Friedrich Bohnenberger again discovered it, but Kater independently invented it and was first to put it in practice.


===The pendulum===

Kater built a pendulum consisting of a brass rod about 2 meters long, inches wide and one-eighth inch thick, with a weight &quot;(d)&quot; on one end. For a low friction pivot he used a pair of short triangular &#x27;knife&#x27; blades attached to the rod. In use the pendulum was hung from a bracket on the wall, supported by the edges of the knife blades resting on flat agate plates. The pendulum had two of these knife blade pivots &quot;(a)&quot;, facing one another, about a meter (40 in) apart, so that a swing of the pendulum took approximately one second when hung from each pivot.

Kater found that making one of the pivots adjustable caused inaccuracies, making it hard to keep the axis of both pivots precisely parallel. Instead he permanently attached the knife blades to the rod, and adjusted the periods of the pendulum by a small movable weight &quot;(b,c)&quot; on the pendulum shaft. Since gravity only varies by a maximum of 0.5% over the Earth, and in most locations much less than that, the weight had to be adjusted only slightly. Moving the weight toward one of the pivots decreased the period when hung from that pivot, and increased the period when hung from the other pivot. This also had the advantage that the precision measurement of the separation between the pivots had to be made only once.

===Experimental procedure===
To use, the pendulum was hung from a bracket on a wall, with the knife blade pivots supported on two small horizontal agate plates, in front of a precision pendulum clock to time the period. It was swung first from one pivot, and the oscillations timed, then turned upside down and swung from the other pivot, and the oscillations timed again. The small weight &quot;(b)&quot; was adjusted with the adjusting screw, and the process repeated until the pendulum had the same period when swung from each pivot. By putting the measured period &quot;T&quot;, and the measured distance between the pivot blades &quot;L&quot;, into the period equation (1), &quot;g&quot; could be calculated very accurately.

Kater performed 12 trials. He measured the period of his pendulum very accurately using the clock pendulum by the &quot;method of coincidences&quot;; timing the interval between the &quot;coincidences&quot; when the two pendulums were swinging in synchronism. He measured the distance between the pivot blades with a microscope comparator, to an accuracy of 10−4 in. (2.5 μm). As with other pendulum gravity measurements, he had to apply small corrections to the result for a number of variable factors:
*the non-zero width of the pendulum&#x27;s swing, which increased the period
*temperature, which caused the length of the rod to vary due to thermal expansion
*atmospheric pressure, which reduced the effective mass of the pendulum by the buoyancy of the displaced air, increasing the period
*altitude, which reduced the gravitational force with distance from the center of the Earth. Gravity measurements are always referenced to sea level.
He gave his result as the length of the seconds pendulum. After corrections, he found that the mean length of the solar seconds pendulum at London, at sea level, at , swinging in vacuum, was 39.1386 inches. This is equivalent to a gravitational acceleration of 9.81158 m/s2. The largest variation of his results from the mean was . This represented a precision of gravity measurement of 0.7×10−5 (7 milligals).

In 1824, the British Parliament made Kater&#x27;s measurement of the seconds pendulum the official backup standard of length for defining the yard if the yard prototype was destroyed.

===Use===
The large increase in gravity measurement accuracy made possible by Kater&#x27;s pendulum established gravimetry as a regular part of geodesy. To be useful, it was necessary to find the exact location (latitude and longitude) of the &#x27;station&#x27; where a gravity measurement was taken, so pendulum measurements became part of surveying. Kater&#x27;s pendulums were taken on the great historic geodetic surveys of much of the world that were being done during the 19th century. In particular, Kater&#x27;s pendulums were used in the Great Trigonometric Survey of India.

Reversible pendulums remained the standard method used for absolute gravity measurements until they were superseded by free-fall gravimeters in the 1950s.

===Repsold–Bessel pendulum===

Repeatedly timing each period of a Kater pendulum, and adjusting the weights until they were equal, was time-consuming and error-prone. Friedrich Bessel showed in 1826 that this was unnecessary. As long as the periods measured from each pivot, &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2, are close in value, the period &quot;T&quot; of the equivalent simple pendulum can be calculated from them:

:formula_4

Here formula_5 and formula_6 are the distances of the two pivots from the pendulum&#x27;s center of gravity. The distance between the pivots, formula_7, can be measured with great accuracy. formula_5 and formula_6, and thus their difference formula_10, cannot be measured with comparable accuracy. They are found by balancing the pendulum on a knife edge to find its center of gravity, and measuring the distances of each of the pivots from the center of gravity. However, because formula_11 is so much smaller than formula_12, the second term on the right in the above equation is small compared to the first, so formula_10 doesn&#x27;t have to be determined with high accuracy, and the balancing procedure described above is sufficient to give accurate results.

Therefore, the pendulum doesn&#x27;t have to be adjustable at all, it can simply be a rod with two pivots. As long as each pivot is close to the center of oscillation of the other, so the two periods are close, the period &quot;T&quot; of the equivalent simple pendulum can be calculated with equation (2), and the gravity can be calculated from &quot;T&quot; and &quot;L&quot; with (1).

In addition, Bessel showed that if the pendulum was made with a symmetrical shape, but internally weighted on one end, the error caused by effects of air resistance would cancel out. Also, another error caused by the non-zero radius of the pivot knife edges could be made to cancel out by interchanging the knife edges.

Bessel didn&#x27;t construct such a pendulum, but in 1864 Adolf Repsold, under contract to the Swiss Geodetic Commission, developed a symmetric pendulum 56 cm long with interchangeable pivot blades, with a period of about second. The Repsold pendulum was used extensively by the Swiss and Russian Geodetic agencies, and in the Survey of India. Other widely used pendulums of this design were made by Charles Peirce and C. Defforges.

=== International Association of Geodesy ===
The 1875 Conference of the European Arc Measurement dealt with the best instrument to be used for the determination of gravity. The association decided in favor of the reversion pendulum and it was resolved to redo in Berlin, in the station where Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel made his famous measurements, the determination of gravity by means of devices of various kinds employed in different countries, in order to compare them and thus to have the equation of their scales, after an in-depth discussion in which an American scholar, Charles Sanders Peirce, took part. Indeed, as the figure of the Earth could be inferred from variations of the seconds pendulum length, the United States Coast Survey&#x27;s direction instructed Charles Sanders Peirce in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe.

The determination of gravity by the reversible pendulum was subject to two types of error. On the one hand the resistance of the air and on the other hand the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum imparted to its plane of suspension. These movements were particularly important with the apparatus designed by the Repsold brothers on the indications of Bessel, because the pendulum had a large mass in order to counteract the effect of the viscosity of the air. While Emile Plantamour was carrying out a series of experiments with this device, Adolph Hirsch found a way to demonstrate the movements of the pendulum&#x27;s suspension plane by an ingenious process of optical amplification. Isaac-Charles Élisée Cellérier, a mathematician from Geneva and Charles Sanders Peirce would independently develop a correction formula that allowed the use of the observations made with this type of gravimeter.

President of the Permanent Commission of the European Arc Measurement from 1874 to 1886, Carlos Ibáñez Ibáñez de Ibero became the first president of the International Geodetic Association (1887–1891) after the death of Johann Jacob Baeyer. Under Ibáñez&#x27;s presidency, the International Geodetic Association acquired a global dimension with the accession of the United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. As a result of the work of the International Geodetic Association, in 1901, Friedrich Robert Helmert found, mainly by gravimetry, parameters of the ellipsoid remarkably close to reality.

<doc id="76429" wikidata="Q208688" url="?curid=76429" title="Treaty of Nice">
<text>The Treaty of Nice was signed by European leaders on 26 February 2001 and came into force on 1 February 2003.

It amended the Maastricht Treaty (or the Treaty on European Union) and the Treaty of Rome (or the Treaty establishing the European Community which, before the Maastricht Treaty, was the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community). The Treaty of Nice reformed the institutional structure of the European Union to withstand eastward expansion, a task which was originally intended to have been done by the Amsterdam Treaty, but failed to be addressed at the time.

The entry into force of the treaty was in doubt for a time, after its initial rejection by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held a little over a year later.

==Provisions of the treaty==
The Nice Treaty was attacked by many people as a flawed compromise. Germany had demanded that its greater population be reflected in a higher vote weighting in the Council; this was opposed by France, who insisted that the symbolic parity between France and Germany be maintained. The Commission had proposed to replace the old weighted voting system with a double majority system which would require those voting in favour to represent a majority of both member states and population for a proposal to be approved. This was also rejected by France for similar reasons. A compromise was reached, which provided for a double majority of Member States and votes cast, and in which a Member State could optionally request verification that the countries voting in favour represented a sufficient proportion of the EU&#x27;s population.

The Treaty provided for an increase after enlargement of the number of seats in the European Parliament to 732, which exceeded the cap established by the Treaty of Amsterdam.

The question of a reduction in the size of the European Commission after enlargement was resolved to a degree — the Treaty providing that once the number of Member States reached 27, the number of Commissioners appointed in the subsequent Commission would be reduced by the Council to below 27, but without actually specifying the target of that reduction. As a transitional measure it specified that after 1 January 2005, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain would each give up their second Commissioner.

The Treaty provided for the creation of subsidiary courts below the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance (now the General Court) to deal with special areas of law such as patents.

The Treaty of Nice provides for new rules on closer co-operation, the rules introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam being viewed as unworkable, and hence these rules have not yet been used.

In response to the failed sanctions against Austria following a coalition including Jörg Haider&#x27;s party having come to power, and fears about possible future threats to the stability of the new member states to be admitted in enlargement, the Treaty of Nice added a preventive mechanism to sanctions against a Member State that was created by the Amsterdam Treaty.

The Treaty also contained provisions to deal with the financial consequences of the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) treaty (Treaty of Paris (1951)).

==The Irish referendums==

Under the current rules for the amendment of the Treaties, the Treaties can only be amended by a new Treaty, which must be ratified by each of the Member States to enter into force.

In all the EU member states the Treaty of Nice was ratified by parliamentary procedure, except in Ireland where, following the decision of the Irish supreme court in &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot;, any amendments that result in a transfer of sovereignty to the European Union require a constitutional amendment. Ireland&#x27;s Constitution can only be amended by a referendum.

===First referendum===

To the surprise of the Irish government and the other EU member states, Irish voters rejected the Treaty of Nice in June 2001. The turnout itself was low (34%), partly a result of the failure of the major Irish political parties to mount a strong campaign on the issue, presuming that the Irish electorate would pass the Treaty as all previous such Treaties had been passed by big majorities.
However, many Irish voters were critical of the Treaty contents, believing that it marginalised smaller states. Others questioned the impact of the Treaty on Irish neutrality. Other sections viewed the leadership of the Union as out of touch and arrogant, with the Treaty offering a perceived chance to &#x27;shock&#x27; the European leadership into a greater willingness to listen to its critics. (A similar argument was made when Denmark initially voted down the Treaty of Maastricht.)

===Second referendum===

The Irish government, having obtained the Seville Declaration on Ireland&#x27;s policy of military neutrality from the European Council, decided to have another referendum on the Treaty of Nice on Saturday, 19 October 2002. Two significant qualifications were included in the second proposed amendment, one requiring the consent of the Dáil for enhanced cooperation under the treaty, and another preventing Ireland from joining any EU common defence policy. A &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote was urged by a massive campaign by the main parties and by civil society and the social partners, including campaigning through canvassing and all forms of media by respected pro-European figures like then EP president Pat Cox, former Czech president Václav Havel, former President of Ireland Patrick Hillery and former Taoiseach (prime minister) Dr. Garret FitzGerald. Prominent civil society campaigns on the Yes side included Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats, the Irish Alliance for Europe led by Professor Brigid Laffan and Adrian Langan, and Ireland for Europe led by Ciarán Toland. On the No Side, the principal campaigns were those of the Green Party, Sinn Féin, Anthony Coughlan&#x27;s National Platform, Justin Barrett&#x27;s No to Nice campaign, and Roger Cole&#x27;s Peace and Neutrality Alliance. The result was a 60% &quot;Yes&quot; vote on a near-50% turn-out.

By then all other EU member states had ratified the Treaty. Ratification by all parties was required by the end of the year, or else the Treaty would have expired.

==Views of the treaty==
Proponents of the Treaty claimed it was a utilitarian adjustment to cumbersome EU governing mechanisms and a required streamlining of the decision-making process, necessary to facilitate enlargement of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe. They claim that, consequently, the treaty was vitally important for the integration and future progress of these former Eastern Bloc countries. Many people who were in favour of greater scope and power of the EU project felt that it did not go far enough and that it would in any case be superseded by future treaties. Proponents differed in the extent to which enlargement may have proceeded without the Treaty: some claimed that the very future of the Union&#x27;s growth—if not existence—was at stake, while others said that enlargement could have legally proceeded—albeit at a slower pace—without it.

Opponents of the Treaty claimed that it was a &quot;technocratic&quot; rather than &quot;democratic&quot; treaty, which would further diminish the sovereignty of national and regional parliaments, and would further concentrate power into a centralised and unaccountable bureaucracy. They also claimed that five applicant countries could have joined the EU without changing the EU&#x27;s rules, and that others could have negotiated on an individual basis, something opponents to the treaty argued would have been to the applicants&#x27; advantage. They also claimed that the Treaty of Nice would create a two-tier EU, which might marginalise Ireland. Opponents pointed out that leading pro-treaty politicians had admitted that if referendums had been held in countries other than Ireland, it would probably have been defeated there as well.

==Criticism==
The Commission and the European Parliament were disappointed that the Nice intergovernmental conference (IGC) did not adopt many of their proposals for reform of the institutional structure or introduction of new Community powers, such as the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor. The European Parliament threatened to pass a resolution against the Treaty; the Italian Parliament threatened it would not ratify it without the former&#x27;s support. However, in the end this did not come to pass and the European Parliament approved the Treaty.

Many argue that the pillar structure, which was maintained by the Treaty, is overcomplicated; that the separate Treaties should be merged into one Treaty; that the three (now two) separate legal personalities of the Communities should be merged; and that the European Community and the European Union should be merged, with the European Union being endowed with legal personality. The German regions were also demanding a clearer separation of the powers of the Union from the Member States.

Nor did the Treaty of Nice deal with the question of the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty; that was also left for the 2004 IGC after the opposition of the United Kingdom.

===Withdrawal===
At the end of January 2020 (GMT), the UK left the EU and so withdrew from this Treaty.

<doc id="76430" wikidata="Q11146811" url="?curid=76430" title="Chrismation">
<text>Chrismation consists of the sacrament or mystery in the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, as well as in the Assyrian Church of the East initiation rites. The sacrament is more commonly known in the West as confirmation, although some languages such as Italian, Maltese and Portuguese normally use the terms &quot;cresima&quot;, &quot;griżma (tal-isqof)&quot; and &quot;crisma&quot; (&quot;chrismation&quot;) rather than &quot;confermazione&quot;, &quot;konferma&quot; or &quot;confirmação&quot;, respectively (&quot;confirmation&quot;).

The term &quot;chrismation&quot; comes about because it involves anointing the recipient of the sacrament with chrism (holy oil), which according to eastern Christian belief, the Apostles sanctified and introduced for all priests to use as a replacement for the laying on of hands by the Apostles.

Chrism consists of a &quot;mixture of 40 sweet-smelling substances and pure olive oil&quot; sanctified by a bishop with some older chrism added in, in the belief that some trace of the initial chrism sanctified by the Apostles remains therein.

==Liturgical form==

===Eastern Orthodox Church===

====Common part of the rite====
The priest anoints the recipient with chrism, making the sign of the cross on the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, ears, breast, hands, and feet using the following words each time: &quot;The seal of the gift of the Holy Ghost&quot; (in Greek: ; in ).

The chrism is washed off by a priest seven days later, according to the written rubrics, the newly baptized wearing their white chitons and not washing their anointed parts for that period. However, in the case of infant baptism (and often also with adult chrismation contemporary practice), the ablution is performed immediately after the rite of chrismation.

====As part of the baptismal rite====

Typically, one becomes a member of the Church by baptism and chrismation performed by a priest as a single service, or subsequent to baptism performed by a layman. While chrismation is often performed without baptism, baptism is never performed without chrismation; hence the term &quot;baptism&quot; is construed as referring to the administration of both sacraments (or mysteries), one after the other.

====At the reconciliation of apostates====

In the Eastern Orthodox Church the mystery may be conferred more than once as it is customary to receive apostates by repeating chrismation; according to the &quot;Book of Needs&quot;, the priest &quot;taking the Holy Chrism, he anoints him (her) according to the order of those who are baptized ...&quot; towards the end of the &quot;Prayers of Purification for One Returning to the True Faith from Apostasy&quot;.

This practice is thus attested to in the ninth century by Saint Methodius of Constantinople in &quot;The Rule of Methodius, Patriarch of Constantinople, Concerning the Return from Apostasy of Various Persons to the True Orthodox Faith&quot;:

If a child ... is in apostasy ... let him be washed. Upon leaving the bath, girded with a linen cloth, let him be anointed with Chrism, as one who is baptized. And let him put on a new robe in the manner of those who have been baptized.

If ... one who is of age has renounced his impending torment ... then let him be washed and anointed with Chrism according to the accepted Rite. And when the Liturgy is celebrated, let him be counted worthy of the Holy Things, occupying himself in Church and the Liturgy, as them that are baptized ...
====At the reception of certain converts====

Although normally administered in conjunction with baptism, in some cases chrismation alone may be used to receive converts to Orthodoxy through the exercise of &quot;economia&quot;. Although practice in this regard varies, in general, if a convert comes to Orthodoxy from another Christian confession and has previously undergone a rite of baptism in the Trinitarian Formula (&quot;in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost&quot;), he or she may be received into the Orthodox Church through the sacrament of chrismation, after which he or she would receive the Holy Eucharist. On the other hand, if a convert comes from a group which practices an invalid, non-Trinitarian baptism (such as Mormons, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, or Oneness Pentecostals) or from one that does not practice baptism at all (such as Quakers or The Salvation Army), baptism is a prerequisite for chrismation—an initiate must always be validly baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost before any further sacraments can be administered. The use of &quot;economia&quot; is at the discretion of, and subject to the guidelines imposed by, the local bishop. Converts from non-Christian religions also need to be baptized before chrismation.

The sacrament of chrismation is an extension of the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Ghost was poured out on the Apostles. It is by chrismation that a person becomes a layperson — a member of the &quot;laos&quot; (laity), the people of God. Metropolitan Kallistos (Timothy Ware) explains:

Through Chrismation every member of the Church becomes a prophet, and receives a share in the royal priesthood of Christ; all Christians alike, because they are chrismated, are called to act as conscious witnesses to the Truth. &quot;You have an anointing (&quot;chrisma&quot;) from the Holy One, and know all things&quot; ().

===Oriental Orthodox churches===
Chrismation in Oriental Orthodoxy is similar to that of Eastern Orthodoxy but is performed according to their sacramental theology, and may vary according to the particular church.

==Sacramental theology==
===Eastern Churches===
Whereas in Western Christian theology, confirmation is seen as completing or sealing of the baptismal covenant, the conferral of full membership, the perfecting one&#x27;s bond with the Church, and/or the strengthening of gifts of the Holy Ghost to enable the recipient to live the Christian life, in the Eastern Orthodox tradition chrismation is understood more fundamentally as the bestowal of the Holy Ghost—that is, as the transmission to that person of the experience of the Day of Pentecost (cf. Acts of the Apostles 2:1-4ff), along with the attendant gifts of the Spirit that are given to all the faithful, and any unique or special gifts that God deems appropriate for that person, to enable him or her to realize his or her intended potentiality as a child of God and as a unique member of Christ&#x27;s Body, the Church. Hence the significance of the sacrament or mystery of chrismation is understood quite distinctly from that of baptism, much as Pentecost is distinct from the Passion and Resurrection.

Whereas in the western churches (e.g. Roman Catholic and Anglican) confirmation is typically reserved to those of &quot;the age of reason&quot;, chrismation in the Eastern churches (including Eastern Rite Catholic Churches) is ordinarily administered immediately after baptism, most commonly infant baptism. After receiving this sacrament, the recipient is eligible to receive the Eucharist; one who has not been chrismated is viewed as not qualified to receive the Eucharist, since they have not yet received the Holy Ghost. Baptism is followed immediately (or at least soon afterwards) by the person&#x27;s first reception of Holy Communion.

The sacramental rite of chrismation may be performed by a presbyter (priest). In the Eastern tradition, chrismation shows the unity of the church through the bishop in the continuation of the Apostolic faith, because the chrism used is prepared and consecrated by a bishop (normally the leading bishop of an autocephalous Church, or – for some autocephalous churches – by the Patriarch of Constantinople) and is presented to the priest by the bishop and (together with the antimension) and is the symbol of the priest&#x27;s permission from the bishop to perform the sacraments (see faculty). Although priests in the Eastern churches are universally granted this faculty, it is thus ultimately considered a sacrament granted by a bishop and associated with that Apostolic office. Furthermore, because some of the previously sanctified chrism is mixed with the newly sanctified chrism, there is a belief that the chrism contains a remnant of, or at least a connection to, the same chrism which was sanctified by the Apostles in the first century, and thus is a symbol of apostolic succession.

===Oriental Orthodox===
The Coptic Orthodox Church follows a tradition that states while the Apostles used to give Confirmation by the laying on of the hands, they found they were not able to travel to lay hands as the number of converts grew. Thus they ordered the collection of the spices which were used to anoint Christ&#x27;s body, and they were mixed with oil, forming, according to Coptic tradition, the first chrism, or &quot;myron&quot;, which, according to tradition, was brought to Egypt by St Mark. The Coptic communion believes that, since that time, the &quot;myron&quot; has been remade 41 times.

===Assyrian Church of the East===
Some similar views to the Orthodox Churches regarding sacramental theology of chrismation are held by the Assyrian Church of the East, which recognizes only two ecumenical councils, the First Council of Nicaea and the First Council of Constantinople.

<doc id="76436" wikidata="Q983650" url="?curid=76436" title="Fort Knox">
<text>Fort Knox is a United States Army installation in Kentucky, south of Louisville and north of Elizabethtown. It is adjacent to the United States Bullion Depository (also known as Fort Knox), which is used to house a large portion of the United States&#x27; official gold reserves, and with which it is often conflated. 

The base covers parts of Bullitt, Hardin and Meade counties. It currently holds the Army Human Resources Center of Excellence, including the Army Human Resources Command. It is named in honor of Henry Knox, Chief of Artillery in the American Revolutionary War and the first United States Secretary of War.
For 60 years, Fort Knox was the home of the U.S. Army Armor Center and School, and was used by both the Army and the Marine Corps to train crews on the American tanks of the day; the last was the M1 Abrams main battle tank. The history of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Cavalry and Armored forces, and of General George S. Patton&#x27;s career, is shown at the General George Patton Museum on the grounds of Fort Knox.

In 2011, the U.S. Army Armor School moved to Fort Moore, Georgia, where the Infantry School is also based. In 2014, the U.S. Army Cadet Command relocated to Fort Knox and all summer training for ROTC cadets now takes place there.

On 16 October 2020, V Corps was reactivated at Fort Knox, just over seven years after the colors were last cased in Wiesbaden, Germany, in July 2013.

== Bullion depository ==

The United States Bullion Depository, often known as Fort Knox, is a fortified vault building adjacent to the Fort Knox Army Post. It is operated by the United States Department of the Treasury, and stores over half the country&#x27;s gold reserves. It is protected by the United States Mint Police, and is well known for its physical security.

The depository was built by the Treasury in 1936 on land transferred to it from Fort Knox. Early shipments of gold totaling almost 13,000 metric tons were escorted by combat cars of the 1st U.S. Cavalry Regiment to the depository. It has in the past safeguarded other precious items, such as the original copies of both the Constitution of the United States and the United States Declaration of Independence.

== Census-designated place ==
Parts of the base in Hardin and Meade counties form a census-designated place (CDP), which had a population of 12,377 at the 2000 census, 10,124 at the 2010 census, and 7,742 at the 2020 census.

== Patton Museum ==
The General George Patton Museum of Leadership at Fort Knox includes an exhibit highlighting leadership issues that arose from the attacks of 11 September 2001, which includes two firetrucks. One of them, designated Foam 161, was partially charred and melted in the attack upon the Pentagon. Fort Knox is also the location of the United States Army&#x27;s Human Resources Command&#x27;s Timothy Maude Center of Excellence, which was named in honor of Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, the highest-ranking member of the U.S. military to die in the attacks of 11 September 2001.

== History ==

=== Fortification ===
Fortifications were constructed near the site in 1861, during the Civil War when Fort Duffield was constructed. Fort Duffield was located on what was known as Muldraugh Hill on a strategic point overlooking the confluence of the Salt and Ohio Rivers and the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike. The area was contested by both Union and Confederate forces. Bands of organized guerrillas frequently raided the area during the war. John Hunt Morgan and the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment of the Confederate Army raided the area before staging his infamous raid across Indiana and Ohio.

=== Post Civil War ===
After the Civil War, the area now occupied by the Army was home to various small communities. In October 1903, military maneuvers for the Regular Army and the National Guards of several states were held at West Point, Kentucky, and the surrounding area. In April 1918, field artillery units from Camp Zachary Taylor arrived at West Point for training. near the village of Stithton were leased to the government and construction for a permanent training center was started in July 1918.

=== New camp ===
The new camp was named after Henry Knox, the Continental Army&#x27;s chief of artillery during the Revolutionary War and the country&#x27;s first Secretary of War. The camp was extended by the purchase of a further in June 1918 and construction properly began in July 1918. The building program was reduced following the end of the war and reduced further following cuts to the army in 1921 after the National Defense Act of 1920. The camp was greatly reduced and became a semi-permanent training center for the 5th Corps Area for Reserve Officer training, the National Guard, and Citizen&#x27;s Military Training Camps (CMTC). For a short while, from 1925 to 1928, the area was designated as &quot;Camp Henry Knox National Forest.&quot;

=== Air Corps use ===
The post contains Godman Army Airfield, which was used by the United States Army Air Corps and its successor, the United States Army Air Forces, as a training base during World War II. It was used by the Kentucky Air National Guard for several years after the war until they relocated to Standiford Field in Louisville. The airfield is still used by the United States Army Aviation Branch.

=== Protection of America&#x27;s founding documents ===
For protection after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States and the Gettysburg Address were moved for safekeeping to the United States Bullion Depository until Major W. C. Hatfield ordered their release after the D-Day Landings on 19 September 1944.

=== Mechanized military unit occupation ===
In 1931 a small force of the mechanized cavalry was assigned to Camp Knox to use it as a training site. The camp was turned into a permanent garrison in January 1932 and renamed Fort Knox. The 1st Cavalry Regiment arrived later in the month to become the 1st Cavalry Regiment (Mechanized).

In 1936 the 1st was joined by the 13th to become the 7th Cavalry Brigade (Mechanized). The site quickly became the center for mechanization tactics and doctrine. The success of the German mechanized units at the start of World War II was a major impetus to operations at the fort. A new Armored Force was established in July 1940 with its headquarters at Fort Knox with the 7th Cavalry Brigade becoming the 1st Armored Division. 

The Armored Force School and the Armored Force Replacement Center were also sited at Fort Knox in October 1940, and their successors remained there until 2011, when the Armor School moved to Fort Moore, Georgia (Fort Benning at the time). The site was expanded to cope with its new role. By 1943, there were 3,820 buildings on . A third of the post has been torn down within the last ten years, with another third slated by 2010.

=== 1947 Universal Military Training Experimental Unit ===

In 1947, Fort Knox hosted the Universal Military Training Experimental Unit, a six-month project that aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of providing new 18–20 year-old Army recruits with basic military training that emphasized physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. This project was undertaken with the aim of persuading the public to support President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s proposal to require all eligible American men to undergo universal military training.

&quot;Stripes&quot; (1981) was filmed using the exterior of Fort Knox but did not show the inside of the facility for security reasons.

=== 1993 shooting ===
On 18 October 1993, Arthur Hill went on a shooting rampage, killing three and wounding two more before attempting to take his own life, Hill shot and severely wounded himself. The shooting occurred at Fort Knox&#x27;s Training Support Center. Prior to the incident, Hill&#x27;s coworkers claimed they were afraid of being around a mentally unstable person who was at work. Hill died on 21 October of complications from his attempted suicide.

=== 2013 shooting ===
On 3 April 2013, a civilian employee was shot and killed in a parking lot on post. The victim was an employee of the United States Army Human Resources Command and was transported to the Ireland Army Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. This shooting caused a temporary lockdown that was lifted around 7 p.m. the same day. U.S. Army Sgt. Marquinta E. Jacobs, a soldier stationed at Fort Knox, was charged on 4 April with the shooting. Jacobs pleaded guilty to charges of premeditated murder and aggravated assault, and was sentenced to 30 years in prison on 10 January 2014.

== Human Resources Command ==
The Army Human Resources Command Center relocated to Fort Knox from the Washington D.C./Virginia area beginning in 2009. New facilities are under construction throughout Fort Knox, such as the new &quot;Army Human Resource Center&quot;, the largest construction project in Fort Knox&#x27;s history. It is a $185 million, three-story, complex of six interconnected buildings, occupying .

In May 2010, The Human Resource Center of Excellence, the largest office building in the state, opened at Fort Knox. It employs nearly 4,300 soldiers and civilians.

== Education ==

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) operates on-post public schools for all sections of the property. They are:
* Kingsolver Elementary School (Pre-Kindergarten-Grade 1)
* Van Voorhis Elementary School (Pre-Kindergarten-Grade 5)
* Scott Intermediate School (Grades 6–8)
* Fort Knox Middle High School (Grades 9–12)

The secondary school, formerly Fort Knox High School, was built in 1958 and has undergone only a handful of renovations since then, including a new building which was completed in 2007.

The median income for a household on the base was US$34,020, and the median income for a family was $33,588. Males had a median income of $26,011 versus $21,048 for females. The per capita income for the base was $12,410. About 5.8% of the population and 6.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.6% of those under the age of 18 and 100.0% of those 65 and older.

<doc id="76440" wikidata="Q741726" url="?curid=76440" title="Fourth wall">
<text>The fourth wall is a performance convention in which an invisible, imaginary wall separates actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this &quot;wall&quot;, the convention assumes the actors act as if they cannot. From the 16th century onward, the rise of illusionism in staging practices, which culminated in the realism and naturalism of the theatre of the 19th century, led to the development of the fourth wall concept.

The metaphor suggests a relationship to the mise-en-scène behind a proscenium arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, in what is known as a box set, the fourth of them would run along the line (technically called the proscenium) dividing the room from the auditorium. The &quot;fourth wall&quot;, though, is a theatrical convention, rather than of set design. The actors ignore the audience, focus their attention exclusively on the dramatic world, and remain absorbed in its fiction, in a state that the theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski called &quot;public solitude&quot; (the ability to behave as one would in private, despite, in actuality, being watched intently while so doing, or to be &quot;alone in public&quot;). In this way, the fourth wall exists regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, the physical arrangement of the theatre building or performance space, or the actors&#x27; distance from or proximity to the audience. In practice, performers often feed off the energy of the audience in a palpable way while modulating performance around the collective response, especially in pacing action around outbursts of laughter, so that lines are not delivered inaudibly.
Breaking the fourth wall is violating this performance convention, which has been adopted more generally in the drama. This can be done by either directly referring to the audience, to the play as a play, or the characters&#x27; fictionality. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play&#x27;s performance conventions is metatheatrical. A similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot; is used to describe such effects in those media. Breaking the fourth wall is also possible in other media, such as video games and books.

==History==
The acceptance of the transparency of the fourth wall is part of the suspension of disbelief between a work of fiction and an audience, allowing them to enjoy the fiction as though they were observing real events. The concept is usually attributed to the philosopher, critic and dramatist Denis Diderot, who wrote in 1758 that actors and writers should &quot;imagine a huge wall across the front of the stage, separating you from the audience, and behave exactly as if the curtain had never risen&quot;. Critic Vincent Canby described it in 1987 as &quot;that invisible scrim that forever separates the audience from the stage&quot;.

Diderot&#x27;s &quot;un grand mur&quot; became &quot;the fourth wall&quot; to Leigh Hunt when in 1807 referring to Mr. Bannister, wrote &quot;No actor enters so well into the spirit of his audience as well as his author, for he engages your attention immediately by seeming to care nothing about you ; the stage appears to be his own room, of which the audience compose the fourth wall&quot;.

===Theatre===
The fourth wall did not exist as a concept for much of dramatic history. Classical plays from ancient Greece to the Renaissance have frequent direct addresses to the audience such as asides and soliloquies.

The presence of the fourth wall is an established convention of modern realistic theatre, which has led some artists to draw direct attention to it for dramatic or comic effect when a boundary is &quot;broken&quot; when an actor or character addresses the audience directly. Breaking the fourth wall is common in pantomime and children&#x27;s theatre where, for example, a character might ask the children for help, as when Peter Pan appeals to the audience to applaud in an effort to revive the fading Tinker Bell (&quot;If you believe in fairies, clap your hands!&quot;).

===Cinema===

One of the earliest recorded breakings of the fourth wall in serious cinema was in Mary MacLane&#x27;s 1918 silent film &quot;Men Who Have Made Love to Me&quot;, in which the enigmatic author – who portrays herself – interrupts the vignettes onscreen to address the audience directly.

Oliver Hardy often broke the fourth wall in his films with Stan Laurel, when he would stare directly at the camera to seek sympathy from viewers. Groucho Marx spoke directly to the audience in &quot;Animal Crackers&quot; (1930), and &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932), in the latter film advising them to &quot;go out to the lobby&quot; during Chico Marx&#x27;s piano interlude. Comedy films by Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker frequently broke the fourth wall, such that with these films &quot;the fourth wall is so flimsy and so frequently shattered that it might as well not exist&quot;, according to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;.

Woody Allen broke the fourth wall repeatedly in his movie &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), as he explained, &quot;because I felt many of the people in the audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them.&quot; His 1985 film &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; features the breaking of the fourth wall as a central plot point.

Jerry Lewis wrote in his 1971 book &quot;The Total Filmmaker&quot;, &quot;Some film-makers believe you should never have an actor look directly into the camera. They maintain it makes the audience uneasy, and interrupts the screen story. I think that is nonsense, and usually I have my actors, in a single, look direct into the camera at least once in a film, if a point is to be served.&quot; Martin and Lewis look directly at the audience in &quot;You&#x27;re Never Too Young&quot; (1955), and Lewis and co-star Stella Stevens each look directly into the camera several times in &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot; (1963), and Lewis&#x27; character holds a pantomime conversation with the audience in &quot;The Disorderly Orderly&quot; (1964). The final scene of &quot;The Patsy&quot; (1964) is famous for revealing to the audience the movie as a movie, and Lewis as actor/director.

The 2022 &quot;Persuasion&quot; film was criticized for its modernization take on the classic 1817 Jane Austen novel by having the main protagonist Anne Elliot (played by Dakota Johnson) constantly breaking the fourth wall by interacting with the audience.

Select theatrical screenings of Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 2024 science fiction epic &quot;Megalopolis&quot;, including its private industry screenings and world premiere at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, had a person walk on stage in front of the projection screen and address the protagonist, Cesar, who seemingly breaks the fourth wall by replying in real time.

On television, the fourth wall has broken throughout the history of the medium.

Fourth wall breakage is common in comedy, and is used frequently by Bugs Bunny and other characters in &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and other later animated shows, as well as the live-action 1960s sketch comedy of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, which the troupe also brought to their feature films. George Burns regularly broke the fourth wall on &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot; (1950).

Another convention of breaking the fourth wall is often seen on mockumentary sitcoms, including &quot;The Office&quot;. Mockumentary shows that break the fourth wall poke fun at the documentary genre with the intention of increasing the satiric tone of the show. Characters in &quot;The Office&quot; directly speak to the audience during interview sequences. Characters are removed from the rest of the group to speak and reflect on their experiences. The person behind the camera, the interviewer, is also referenced when the characters gaze and speak straight to the camera. The interviewer, however, is only indirectly spoken to and remains hidden. This technique, when used in shows with complex genres, serves to heighten the comic tone of the show while also proving that the camera itself is far from a passive onlooker.

Another approach to breaking the fourth wall is through a central narrator character who is part of the show&#x27;s events, but at times speaks directly to the audience. For example, Francis Urquhart in the British TV drama series &quot;House of Cards&quot;, &quot;To Play the King&quot; and &quot;The Final Cut&quot; addresses the audience several times during each episode, giving the viewer comments on his own actions on the show. The same technique is also used, though less frequently, in the American adaptation of &quot;House of Cards&quot; by main character Frank Underwood.

The Netflix series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, based on Daniel Handler&#x27;s book series of the same name, incorporates some of the narrative elements from the books by having Lemony Snicket as a narrator character (played by Patrick Warburton) speaking directly to the television viewer that frequently breaks the fourth wall to explain various literary wordplay in a manner similar to the book&#x27;s narration. The protagonist of &quot;Fleabag&quot; also frequently uses the technique to provide exposition, internal monologues, and a running commentary to the audience.

Every episode of the sitcom &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; breaks the fourth wall during the introduction by the character Zack Morris. Most episodes have several other fourth wall breaks. This is similar to how &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;, &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; and &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; use fourth wall breaks to set up stories or have characters comment on situations. Showtime&#x27;s Shameless has a main character breaking the fourth wall at every episode beginning to deliberately criticize and threaten the viewers to emphasize the morally deficient plots and characters likely in an deliberate attempt to turn away any naïve viewers to maintain the exclusiveness of the series, only to add to its popularity.

Furthermore, breaking the fourth wall can also be used in meta-referencing in order to draw attention to or invite reflection about a specific in-universe issue. An example of this is in the first episode of the final season of the show &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, where a newly introduced character, Falco Grice, starts to hallucinate about events that took place in the last 3 seasons. This literary device utilises self-referencing to trigger media-awareness in the recipient, used to signpost the drastic shift in perspective from the Eldian to the Marleyan side, and can be employed in all sorts of media.

The use of breaking the fourth wall in television has sometimes been unintentional. In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot;, the character of Morgus looks directly at the camera when thinking aloud. This was due to actor John Normington misunderstanding a stage direction, but the episode&#x27;s director, Graeme Harper, felt that this helped increase dramatic tension, and decided not to reshoot the scenes.

===Video games===
Given their interactive nature, nearly all video games break the fourth wall by asking for the player&#x27;s participation and having user interface elements on the screen (such as explanations of the game&#x27;s controls) that address the player rather than their character. Methods of fourth wall breaking within the narrative include having the character face the direction of the player/screen, having a self-aware character that recognizes that they are in a video game, or having secret or bonus content set outside the game&#x27;s narrative that can either extend the game world (such as with the use of false documents) or provide &quot;behind the scenes&quot; type content. Such cases typically create a video game that includes a metafiction narrative, commonly presently characters in the game incorporating knowledge they are in a video game.

For example, in &quot;Doki Doki Literature Club!&quot;, one of the characters named Monika is aware that she is a part of a video game, and at the end, communicates with the player. To progress further in the story, the player must remove the “monika.chr” file (an action they take outside of the game). The plot of the game &quot;OneShot&quot; revolves around the fictional universe of the game being a simulation running on the player&#x27;s computer, with certain characters being aware of this fact and sometimes communicating directly with the player. In other cases of metafictional video games, the game alters the player&#x27;s expectation of how the game should behave, which may make the player question if their own game system is at fault, helping to increase the immersion of the game.

But since video games are inherently much more interactive than traditional films and literature, defining what truly breaks the fourth wall in the video game medium becomes difficult. Steven Conway, writing for &quot;Gamasutra&quot;, suggests that in video games, many purported examples of breaking the fourth wall are actually better understood as &quot;relocations&quot; of the fourth wall or expansions of the &quot;magic circle&quot; (the fictional game world) to encompass the player. This is in contrast to traditional fourth wall breaks, which break the audience&#x27;s illusion or suspension of disbelief, by acknowledging them directly. Conway argues that this expansion of the magic circle in video games actually serves to more fully immerse a player into the fictional world rather than take the viewer out of the fictional world, as is more common in traditional fourth wall breaks. An example of this expansion of the magic circle can be found in the game &quot;&quot;, in which the player receives an in-game email at their real-life email address and must visit out-of-game websites to solve some of the puzzles in the game. Other games may expand the magic circle to include the game&#x27;s hardware. For example, &quot;X-Men&quot; for the Mega Drive/Genesis requires players to reset their game console at a certain point to reset the X-Men&#x27;s in-game Hazard Room, while &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; asks the player to put the DualShock controller on their neck to simulate a back massage being given in-game.

Other examples include the idle animation of Sonic the Hedgehog in his games where the on-screen character would look to the player and tap his foot impatiently if left alone for a while, and one level of &quot;Max Payne&quot; has the eponymous character come to the realization he and other characters are in a video game and narrates what the player sees as part of the UI. &quot;Eternal Darkness&quot;, which included a sanity meter, would simulate various common computer glitches to the player as the sanity meter drained, including the Blue Screen of Death. &quot;The Stanley Parable&quot; is also a well-known example of this, as the narrator from the game constantly tries to reason with the player, even going so far as to beg the player to switch off the game at one point.

===Literature===
The method of breaking the fourth wall in literature is a metalepsis (the transgression of narrative levels), which is a technique often used in metafiction. The metafiction genre occurs when a character within a literary work acknowledges the reality that they are in fact a fictitious being. The use of the fourth wall in literature can be traced back as far as &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a late modern era example.

It was popularized in the early 20th century during the Post-Modern literary movement. Artists like Virginia Woolf in &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; and Kurt Vonnegut in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; used the genre to question the accepted knowledge and sources of the culture. The use of metafiction or breaking the fourth wall in literature varies from that on stage in that the experience is not communal but personal to the reader and develops a self-consciousness within the character/reader relationship that works to build trust and expand thought. This does not involve an acknowledgment of a character&#x27;s fictive nature. Breaking the fourth wall in literature is not always metafiction.

Modern examples of breaking the fourth wall include Ada Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Terra Ignota&quot;, and William Goldman&#x27;s &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;. Sorj Chalandon wrote a novel called &quot;The 4th wall&quot; of the setting-up of a theatrical performance of Antigone in Beirut, while the civil war is raging.

<text>Søren Peter Lauritz Sørensen (9 January 1868 – 12 February 1939) was a Danish chemist, known for the introduction of the concept of pH, a scale for measuring acidity and alkalinity.

== Personal life ==
Sørensen was born in Havrebjerg Denmark in 1868 as the son of a farmer. He began his studies at the University of Copenhagen at the age of 18. He wanted to make a career in medicine, but under the influence of chemist Sophus Mads Jørgensen decided to change to chemistry.

While studying for his doctorate he worked as assistant in chemistry at the laboratory of the Technical University of Denmark, assisted in a geological survey of Denmark, and also worked as a consultant for the Royal Navy Dockyard.

Sørensen was married twice. His second wife was Margrethe Høyrup Sørensen, who collaborated with him in his studies.

==Work==
From 1901 to 1938, Sørensen was head of the prestigious Carlsberg Laboratory, Copenhagen. While working at the Carlsberg Laboratory he studied the effect of ion concentration on proteins and, because the concentration of hydrogen ions was particularly important, he introduced the pH-scale as a simple way of expressing it in 1909. The article in which he introduced the scale (using the notation formula_1) was published in French and Danish as well as in German described two methods for measuring acidity which Sørensen and his students had refined. The first method was based on electrodes, whereas the second involved comparing the colours of samples and a preselected set of indicators. (Sørensen, 1909).

:From p. 134: &quot;Die Größe der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration … und die Bezeichnung formula_1 für den numerischen Wert des Exponent dieser Potenz benütze.&quot; (The magnitude of the hydrogen ion concentration is accordingly expressed by the normality factor of the solution concerned, based on the hydrogen ions, and this factor is written in the form of a negative power of 10. By the way, as I refer [to it] in a following section (see p. 159), I just want to point out here that I use the name &quot;hydrogen ion exponent&quot; and the notation formula_1 for the numerical value of the exponent of this power.)

:From pp. 159–160: &quot;&quot;Für die Zahl &quot;p&quot; schlage ich den Namen &quot;Wasserstoffionenexponent&quot; … Normalitätsfaktors der Lösung verstanden.&quot;&quot; (For the number &quot;p&quot; I suggest the name &quot;hydrogen ion exponent&quot; and the notation formula_1. By the hydrogen ion exponent (formula_1) of a solution is thus understood the Briggsian logarithm of the reciprocal value of the normality factor of the solution, based on the hydrogen ions, and this factor is written in the form of a negative power of 10). 

:Starting on p. 139, &quot;4. Meßmethoden zur Bestimmung der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration.&quot; (4. Methods of measurement for the determination of hydrogen ion concentration.), Sørensen reviewed a series of methods for measuring hydrogen ion concentration. He rejected all of them except two.

:From p. 144: &quot;Es gibt noch zwei Verfahrungsweisen, … bzw. die colorimetrische Methode genannt.&quot; (There are still two procedures by which the hydrogen or hydroxyl ion concentration of a solution can be determined; namely, gas chain measurement and determination by means of indicators, also called the electrometric or colorimetric method.) On pp. 145–146, Sørensen outlined the electrometric and colorimetric methods:

::From p. 145: &quot;Die elektrometrische Methode. Wird eine mit Platin-schwarz bedeckte Platinplatte in eine wäßerige … von der Wasserstoffionenkonzentration der Lösung abhängt.)&quot; (The electrometric method. If a platinum plate that&#x27;s covered with platinum black is dipped into an aqueous – acidic, neutral, or alkaline – solution and if the solution is saturated with hydrogen, then one finds, between the platinum plate and the solution, a voltage difference whose magnitude depends on the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution according to a law.

::From pp. 145: &quot;Die colorimetrische Methode. Der Umschlag des Indicators bei einer gewöhnlichen Titrierung bedeutet ja, wie bekannt, daß die Konzentration der Wasserstoffionen der vorliegenden Lösung eine gewisse Größe von der einen oder der anderen Seite her erreicht oder überschritten hat.&quot; (The colorimetric method. The sudden change of the indicator during a typical titration means, as is known, that the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution at hand has reached or exceeded – from one direction or the other – a certain magnitude.)

: p. 146: &quot;Die Grundlage ist seit langer Zeit bekannt, … eine vollständige Reihe Indikatoren mit Umschlagspunkten bei den verschiedensten Ionenkonzentrationen zusammenzustellen.&quot; (The basis [of the colorimetric method] has been known for a long time, but the scattered material was first struggled through and perfected at certain points by the beautiful investigations of Hans Friedenthal [1870-1942] and Eduard Salm, so that it became possible for them to assemble a complete series of indicators with transition points at the most varied ion concentrations.)

:On pp. 150ff, the electrometric method is detailed; and on pp. 201ff, the colorimetric method is detailed.

<text>Gascony (; ) was a province of the southwestern Kingdom of France that succeeded the Duchy of Gascony (602–1453). From the 17th century until the French Revolution (1789–1799), it was part of the combined Province of Guyenne and Gascony. The region is vaguely defined, and the distinction between Guyenne and Gascony is unclear; by some they are seen to overlap, while others consider Gascony a part of Guyenne. Most definitions put Gascony east and south of Bordeaux.

It is currently divided between the region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine (departments of Landes, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, southwestern Gironde, and southern Lot-et-Garonne) and the region of Occitanie (departments of Gers, Hautes-Pyrénées, southwestern Tarn-et-Garonne, and western Haute-Garonne).

Gascony was historically inhabited by Basque-related people who appear to have spoken a language similar to Basque. The name Gascony comes from the same root as the word Basque (see Wasconia below). From the Middle Ages until today, the Gascon language has been spoken, although it is classified as a regional variant of the Occitan language.

Gascony is the land of d&#x27;Artagnan, who inspired Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s character d&#x27;Artagnan in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, as well as the land of Cyrano de Bergerac, the eponymous character of the play by Edmond Rostand. It is also home to Henry III of Navarre, who later became king of France as Henry IV.

==History==
===Aquitania===
In pre-Roman times, the inhabitants of Gascony were the Aquitanians (), who spoke a non-Indo-European language related to modern Basque.

The Aquitanians inhabited a territory limited to the north and east by the river Garonne, to the south by the Pyrenees mountain range, and to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The Romans called this territory Aquitania, either from the Latin word (meaning &quot;water&quot;), in reference to the many rivers flowing from the Pyrenees through the area, or from the name of the Aquitanian Ausci tribe, in which case Aquitania would mean &quot;land of the Ausci&quot;.

In the 50s BC, Aquitania was conquered by lieutenants of Julius Caesar and became part of the Roman Empire.

Later, in 27 BC, during the reign of Emperor Augustus, the province of Gallia Aquitania was created. Gallia Aquitania was far larger than the original Aquitania, as it extended north of the Garonne, in fact all the way north to the river Loire, thus including the Celtic Gauls that inhabited the regions between the rivers Garonne and Loire.

===Novempopulana===
In 297, as Emperor Diocletian reformed the administrative structures of the Roman Empire, Aquitania was split into three provinces. The territory south of the Garonne River, corresponding to the original Aquitania, was made a province called Novempopulania (that is, &quot;land of the nine tribes&quot;), while the part of Gallia Aquitania north of the Garonne became the province of Aquitanica I and the province of Aquitanica II. The territory of Novempopulania corresponded mostly to that of modern Gascony.

The Aquitania Novempopulana or Novempopulania suffered like the rest of the Western Roman Empire from the invasions of Germanic tribes, most notably the Vandals in 407–409. In 416–418, Novempopulania was delivered to the Visigoths as their federate settlement lands and became part of the Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse, while other than the region of the Garonne river their actual grip on the area may have been rather loose.

The Visigoths were defeated by the Franks in 507, and fled into Spain and Septimania. Novempopulania then became part of the Frankish Kingdom like the rest of southern France. However, Novempopulania was far away from the home base of the Franks in northern France, and was only very loosely controlled by the Franks. During all the troubled and historically obscure period, starting from early 5th-century accounts, the bagaudae are often cited, social uprisings against tax exaction and feudalization, largely associated to Vasconic unrest.

===Duchy of Gascony===


Old historical literature sometimes claims the Basques took control of the whole of Novempopulania in the Early Middle Ages, founding its claims on the testimony of Gregory of Tours, on the etymological link between the words &quot;Basque&quot; and &quot;Gascon&quot; – both derived from &quot;Vascones&quot; or &quot;Wasconia&quot;, the latter being used to name the whole of Novempopulania.

Modern historians reject this hypothesis, which is sustained by no archeological evidence. For Juan José Larrea, and Pierre Bonnassie, &quot;a Vascon expansionism in Aquitany is not proved and is not necessary to understand the historical evolution of this region&quot;. This Basque-related culture and race is, whatever the origin, attested in (mainly Carolingian) Medieval documents, while their exact boundaries remain unclear (&quot;Wascones, qui trans Garonnam et circa Pirineum montem habitant&quot; -- &quot;Wascones, who live across the Garonne and around the Pyrenees mountains&quot;, as stated in the Royal Frankish Annals, for one).

The word &quot;Vasconia&quot; evolved into &quot;Wasconia&quot;, and then into &quot;Gasconia&quot; (&quot;w&quot; often evolved into &quot;g&quot; under the influence of Romance languages; cf. &quot;warranty&quot; and &quot;guarantee&quot;, &quot;warden&quot; and &quot;guardian&quot;, &quot;wile&quot; and &quot;guile&quot;, &quot;William&quot; and &quot;Guillaume&quot;). The gradual abandonment of the Basque-related Aquitanian language in favor of a local Vulgar Latin was not reversed. The replacing local Vulgar Latin evolved into Gascon. (for example, Latin &quot;f&quot; became &quot;h&quot;; cf. Latin , French , Spanish , Occitan , but Gascon ). 

Meanwhile, Viking raiders conquered several Gascon towns, among them Bayonne in 842–844. Their attacks in Gascony may have helped the political disintegration of the duchy until their defeat by William II Sánchez of Gascony in 982. In turn, the weakened ethnic polity known as Duchy of Wasconia/Wascones, unable to get around the general spread of feudalization, gave way to a myriad of counties founded by Gascon lords.

===Angevin Empire===


The 1152 marriage of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine allowed the former to gain control of his new wife&#x27;s possessions of Aquitaine and Gascony. This addition to his already plentiful holdings made Henry the most powerful vassal in France.

In 1248, Simon de Montfort was appointed Governor in the unsettled Duchy of Gascony. Bitter complaints were excited by de Montfort&#x27;s rigour in suppressing the excesses of both the seigneurs of the nobility and the contending factions in the great communes. Henry III yielded to the outcry and instituted a formal inquiry into Simon&#x27;s administration. Simon was formally acquitted of the charges, but in August 1252 he was nevertheless dismissed. Henry then himself went to Gascony, pursuing a policy of conciliation; he arranged the marriage between Edward, his 14-year-old son, and Eleanor of Castile, daughter of Alfonso X. Alfonso renounced all claims to Gascony and assisted the Plantagenets against rebels such as Gaston de Bearn, who had taken control of the Pyrenees.

In December 1259, Louis IX of France ceded to Henry land north and east of Gascony. In return, Henry renounced his claim to many of the territories that had been lost by King John.

In May 1286, King Edward I paid homage before the new king, Philip IV of France, for the lands in Gascony. However, in May 1294, Philip confiscated the lands, initiating the Gascon War. Between 1294 and 1298, Edward sent three expeditionary forces to recover Gascony, but Philip was able to retain most of the territory until the Treaty of Paris in 1303.

In 1324 when Edward II of England, in his capacity as Duke of Aquitaine, failed to pay homage to the French king after a dispute, Charles IV declared the duchy forfeit at the end of June 1324, and military action by the French followed. Edward sent his wife Isabella, who was sister to the French king, to negotiate a settlement. The Queen departed for France on 9 March 1325, and in September was joined by her son, the heir to the throne, Prince Edward (later Edward III of England). Isabella&#x27;s negotiations were successful, and it was agreed that the young Prince Edward would perform homage in the king&#x27;s place, which he did on 24 September and so the duchy was returned to the English crown.

When France&#x27;s Charles IV died in 1328 leaving only daughters, his nearest male relative was Edward III of England, the son of Isabella, the sister of the dead king; but the question arose whether she could legally transmit the inheritance of the throne of France to her son even though she herself, as a woman, could not inherit the throne. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest heir through male ancestry was Charles IV&#x27;s first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and it was decided that he should be crowned Philip VI of France. Philip believed that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal, so in May 1337 he met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip&#x27;s hands, thus precipitating the Hundred Years War between England and France. At the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, after Gascony had changed hands several times, the English were finally defeated at the Battle of Castillon on 17 July 1453; Gascony remained French from then on.

===Province of Guyenne and Gascony===

From the 17th century onwards, the government of Gascony was united with Guyenne. The government of Guyenne and Gascony (&quot;&quot;), with its capital at Bordeaux, lasted until the end of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; in 1792.

==Geography==
Gascony is limited by the Atlantic Ocean (western limit) and the Pyrenees mountains (southern limit); as the area of Gascon language, it extends to the Garonne (North), and close to the Ariège (river) (East) from the Pyrenees to the confluence of the Garonne with the Ariège. The other most important river is Adour, along with its tributaries Gave de Pau and Gave d&#x27;Oloron.

The most important towns are:

* Auch, the historical capital
* Bayonne, with both Basque and Gascon identity
* Bordeaux, crossed by the Garonne
* Dax
* Lourdes
* Luchon
* Mont-de-Marsan
* Pau, with both Bearnese and Gascon identity
* Tarbes

Bayonne, Dax and Tarbes are crossed by the Adour. Pau and Lourdes are crossed by the Gave de Pau. Mont-de-Marsan also belongs to the drainage basin of the Adour. The Gers (river), a tributary of the Garonne, flows through Auch.

<doc id="76464" wikidata="Q209546" url="?curid=76464" title="Batasuna">
<text>Batasuna (; ) was a Basque nationalist political party. Based mainly in Spain, it was banned in 2003, after a court ruling declared proven that the party was financing ETA with public money.

The party is included in the &quot;European Union list of terrorist persons and organizations&quot; as a component of ETA. Right after having been banned, Batasuna still managed to organize or support some rallies, public actions and several workplace strikes. The Spanish ruling was appealed before and, later on, confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights.

As an association and not as a political party, Batasuna had a minor presence in the French Basque Country, where it remained legal as &quot;Batasuna&quot; until its self-dissolution in January 2013.

Batasuna&#x27;s ranks and support base have been represented under different names since it was first declared legal in the late 1970s with the Spanish Transition to democracy. Thus, Batasuna&#x27;s predecessors were the original Herri Batasuna and, then, Euskal Herritarrok. After having been outlawed in 2003, Batasuna&#x27;s core support revamped yet again by co-opting the thus far marginal parties EHAK and Acción Nacionalista Vasca (ANV).

Batasuna was a part of the &quot;Basque National Liberation Movement&quot; which includes social organizations, trade unions, youth (Jarrai and Gazteriak, now merged in Haika and Segi), and women&#x27;s groups (Egizan). Jarrai-Haika-Segi, Gestoras pro-Amnistia, Askatasuna and other groups closely related to Batasuna were also declared illegal by different court rulings on the same charges of having collaborated with or being part of ETA.

==History and outline==

The party was founded in April 1978 as Herri Batasuna, a coalition of leftist nationalist political groups mostly originating from Euskadiko Ezkerra initially brought together to advocate for &quot;no&quot; in the referendum to be held that year on the Spanish constitution.

Its constituent parties had been called together by senior Basque nationalist Telesforo de Monzón in a 1978 meeting called &quot;the table of Alsasua.&quot; Herri Batasuna&#x27;s founding convention was held in Lekeitio, home of Santiago Brouard who was then the leader of HASI (Herriko Alderdi Sozialista Iraultzailea or Revolutionary Socialist People&#x27;s Party). The party won 150,000 votes in the Basque Country (15%) and 22,000 additional votes in Navarre (9%) in its first Spanish general election in March 1979. Thus, they won three seats in the Spanish Parliament, which they did not occupy. Same happened in 1980 in the first elections to the Basque Parliament, in which HB stood as second political force, with 151,636 votes (16.55%) winning 11 seats. Its absence allowed a BNP-only Basque Government led by Carlos Garaikoetxea. On 20 November 1984 Brouard was assassinated by two members of the GAL. The killing is perhaps the only one performed by the GAL death squad within Spain itself.

Another well-known Herri Batasuna leader and newly elected Spanish MP, Josu Muguruza, was assassinated by right-wing extremists in November 1989 in Madrid. GAL claimed responsibility for Muguruza&#x27;s assassination. Suspicions also centered on Spanish neo-Nazi group Bases Autónomas.

==Recent times==

Amid the first talk of the Spanish government investigating the ties of Herri Batasuna with ETA, in 1998 Herri Batasuna was the driving force of the newly formed Euskal Herritarrok (&quot;We Basque Citizens&quot;) coalition, an acronym which got the best results to date for Basque left separatism in the Basque community, with 224,000 votes out of a total of 1,250,000 in the Basque election held that year.

The most recent public party spokesmen was Arnaldo Otegi. Otegi, like a number of other top-ranks in Herri Batasuna, had been a member of ETA and served several years in prison for bank assault. He is currently serving time in prison for ties with ETA. 
Another important member of Batasuna was José Antonio Urrutikoetxea Bengoetxea, alias Josu Ternera, the main leader of ETA between 1987 and 1989 and accused of a number of assassinations like the 1987 Hipercor bombing which killed 21 people at Hipercor - a shopping center in Barcelona. He was imprisoned in France after 1989, released after finishing his sentence and was transferred to Spanish prisons, where he stayed for two more years until his release by the Constitutional Court, which stipulated that he had served his prison term in France. He was included in the Batasuna electoral ticket and elected to the Basque parliament between 1999 and 2001, where he was appointed as his party&#x27;s representative in the Human Rights commission at the Basque Parliament, which, given his criminal background caused a stir in the rest of parties. He disappeared when the Spanish courts reopened cold charges and presented new ones about his current membership in ETA. Presently he lives in hiding and is considered one of the leaders of ETA that are pushing for negotiations.

Amid a period of separatist kale borroka street attacks on the offices of the Basque Nationalist Party and other establishment targets, Batasuna together with the union Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak convoked a day of protest and general strike on 9 March 2006. On the morning of the strike, ETA detonated several bombs near highways, with no injuries. Employers reported scant overall participation in the strike, approximately 0.5% of private sector workers, 1% of government workers and 3–4% of workers in education. A few thousands of Batasuna militants joined protests, while others blocked rail lines and roads and occupied municipal halls Batasuna leader Arnaldo Otegi was ordered to appear in court to answer for the bomb attacks and disruption, but delayed his appearance repeatedly on the grounds of illness.

In September 2008, in what has been the closest to a disengagement of ETA so far, members of the party, while not condemning ETA&#x27;s tactics whatsoever, did say the &quot;political-military strategy&quot; of the latter is an &quot;obstacle&quot; to aspirations for Basque independence. They called for a &quot;unifying project for the pro-independence left&quot; which would be aimed at creating an electoral list for regional elections to be held in Spring 2009.

==Electoral results==

Batasuna&#x27;s support in the elections to the parliament of the Basque Autonomous Community (under the three brands it has used, i.e., Herri Batasuna, Euskal Herritarrok and EHAK) oscillates around 15% of the total votes, its best result being the 18.33% achieved in 1990 and the lowest the 10.12% of the total votes obtained in 2001.

In Navarre its results in the elections to the Navarrese Foral parliament have been historically slightly less than 15% of the total votes, reaching their highest result in 1999 (15.95% of the total votes) and their lowest in 1995 (9.22% of the total votes). In this territory other Basque pro-independence left wing parties which reject violence and so remain legal - namely Batzarre and specifically, Aralar- eroded Batasuna&#x27;s support in a more significant way than in the Basque Autonomous Community.

Batasuna had representatives in the European Parliament and in the parliaments of Navarre and the provinces of the Basque Autonomous Community. It also ruled some 62 local councils, and had members in many more. While it was fairly represented in all Basque and Navarrese Spanish territories, Batasuna counted as its stronghold the province of Gipuzkoa. After being banned, Batasuna lost all its representatives in the Spanish Parliament, since regaining (under different names) some their seats in elections held after its banning.

While the party has been barred from formally taking part in elections since 2003 (see below), it has coordinated a variety of forms of participation (or &quot;quantifiable non-participation&quot;) in recent elections. After the May 2003 provincial and local elections, followers of the local lists protested claiming the council seats corresponding to the invalid votes (127,000, 10% of the total vote in the Basque Country).
For the Basque elections of 2005, Batasuna presented lists of candidates but they were dismissed as illegal. After the new election was held for the Basque regional parliament, Batasuna lost all their remaining elected representatives.

Like those parties, representatives of EHAK refused to explicitly condemn the ETA attacks but, given the fact that elections were to be held in a matter of days, the courts did not have the time to assess EHAK&#x27;s compliance with the Ley de Partidos. The People&#x27;s Party requested that the Spanish government conducts investigations to ban EHAK-PCTV too, though the State Legal Service (&quot;Abogacía General del Estado&quot;) and the Attorney General&#x27;s Office (&quot;Fiscalía General del Estado&quot;) found no evidence to support legal actions against the party. Batasuna asked their supporters to vote for EHAK.

In the Basque elections of 17 April 2005, EHAK obtained 150,188 votes (12.5%), entering the Basque Parliament with nine seats (all but one being women).

===Spanish Parliament===

Batasuna stood in a number of elections for the Spanish Parliament. They first stood in 1979 obtaining their best results in the Basque autonomous community where they polled 15% and won three seats. In Navarre they polled almost 9% but failed to win a seat.

They lost a seat in the 1982 election. Their high point came in the 1986 election where they won 5 seats, including one seat in Navarre, the only occasion in which they have won a seat there. They lost their Navarre seat in the 1989 election and lost a further two seats in the 1996 election, which overall proved to be the party&#x27;s worst performance in terms of vote share. At provincial level, their best results came in Guipúzcoa where the party topped the poll in the 1989 general election.

==Outlawed in Spain==

The party denied any links to ETA. However, proponents of the party&#x27;s illegalization pointed to a coincidence of Batasuna and ETA&#x27;s strategies. A significant number of Batasuna leaders have been imprisoned because of their activities in ETA. The party has never condemned any attack by ETA and its leaders have referred sometimes to the ETA members as &#x27;Basque soldiers&#x27;, and justified their actions: &quot;ETA does not use the armed struggle as a mean to defend this or that political project but to give [the Basque Country] democratic channels that enable the popular will to be expressed in full freedom.&quot; It is also common to refer to ETA militants as &quot;Gudariak&quot;, soldiers in Basque language.

Since the 1980s, there had been talk of attempts to ban the party, which resulted in Batasuna frequently changing its name as part of the effort to avoid this, from the original &quot;Herri Batasuna&quot;, then becoming part of the &quot;Euskal Herritarrok&quot; coalition in the 1990s and, finally, Batasuna. Members of the Basque left consider the Spanish government&#x27;s efforts against Batasuna and its successors to be part of an organized campaign targeting the social support for the independence movement. They point to government crackdowns against the newspaper &quot;Egin&quot;, the radio station Herri Irratia and the network of pubs that were gathering places for the independentist left.

In 2002, started the first serious attempt by the Spanish government to ban the party. In June, the parliament passed legislation that outlawed parties under certain conditions, on the grounds of their support for terrorism. In July Batasuna was fined €24 million for vandalism and street violence in 2001. Following an ETA car bomb attack on 4 August the Spanish parliament was recalled. The party was suspended for three years by Judge Baltasar Garzón on 27 August to allow him to investigate the party links to ETA. Garzón and the government presented 23 arguments for the ban, focusing on the party&#x27;s refusal to condemn ETA attacks, its reference to detainees as political prisoners, collaboration with other banned abertzale forces, and ETA&#x27;s support in communiqués for Batasuna&#x27;s political strategy.

In 2003, Batasuna was declared illegal in Spain by a court ruling of the Spanish Supreme Court, then confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Spain. The decision automatically cut them off from the state funding received by all legal political parties with Parliament representation. In spite of legal text forbidding its reorganization under another name, its members tried to use, ever since the outlawing, a plethora of local lists. Most of these lists were considered to be a front for Batasuna by the Spanish Supreme Court. This decision was confirmed by the Spanish Constitutional Court. The ban prohibits their representatives from contesting elections, holding public demonstrations or rallies and freezes their assets. On the 26th the Spanish parliament voted for an indefinite ban, 295 to 10. The party&#x27;s main offices in Pamplona were closed by the police and further offices in San Sebastián, Bilbao and Vitoria-Gasteiz were targeted.

Still, party activity did not cease completely, as proved by the fact that on 4 October 2007 twenty-three top members of Batasuna were arrested as they left a secret meeting in Segura (Guipúzcoa), accused of holding an illegal political meeting.

===Schism===

Prior to the outlaw effort, a dissenting minority had left the party to form Aralar. While sharing separatist aims with Batasuna, Aralar rejected political violence and ETA&#x27;s assassinations and therefore remains a legal party.

==Attempts to reorganize==

In spite of the prohibition of reorganizing under different names in order to circumvent the legal ruling, Batasuna&#x27;s ranks have tried a series of attempts to reorganize under new names, which include, among others, Autodeterminaziorako Bilgunea, Aukera Guztiak, Askatasuna or D3M. All have been legally banned for alleged ties to Batasuna and, in turn, to ETA.

In May 2004, a list named &quot;Herritarren Zerrenda&quot; (&quot;Citizens&#x27; List&quot;) was presented in Spain and France to the 2004 European Parliament election. Spanish tribunals rejected it, as a successor of Batasuna. However, the HZ list in France remained legal.

HZ candidates in Spain then campaigned for using the French HZ ballot in Spain, which was to be counted as a null vote.
There were more than 98,000 null votes in the Basque Autonomous Country and more than 15,000 in Navarre. HZ leaders interpreted the high rate of null votes, which was 12% of the total, to mean that most of the nulls were for HZ, since in the previous European elections the null vote was less than 1%.

A more successful strategy for Batasuna proved to be the one of co-opting existing marginal parties giving the shortest possible notice before an election, so that there was no time for the Spanish Supreme Court to legally assess the lawfulness of this move before the election was held. Thus, for the regional 2005 Basque parliamentary election the so-far marginal EHAK party announced that they were ready to bring the programs of Batasuna to the Basque regional parliament.
(EHAK had been legally registered in 2002 but had no known activity until 2005). The party could participate in those elections, but then was declared illegal by a court ruling because of ties with Batasuna, which prevented it from contesting the 2007 Spanish regional elections.

Then, the same strategy was tried by co-opting Acción Nacionalista Vasca a historical, yet basically inactive Basque party. This time, the Spanish Supreme Court could make a quick assessment of ANV&#x27;s municipal candidates, which resulted in roughly half of them being banned (because the candidates included people who had previously run for the illegal Herri Batasuna or Batasuna) while the other half was ruled lawful and could participate in the elections to be held shortly after the ruling.

Then, in September 2008 the full legal inquiry on the party was finalized, ruling that ANV as a whole was illegal, due to ties with Batasuna-ETA. The Basque regional government, then led by a Basque nationalist coalition of the PNV and EA objected to these legal rulings.

As a result of this pressure, for the first time since Herri Batasuna was formed, neither Batasuna nor its proxies could participate in the Basque regional parliament at the time of the 2009 Basque parliamentary election.

In February 2011, Sortu, a party described as &quot;the new Batasuna&quot;, was launched. Unlike predecessor parties, Sortu claimed that it explicitly rejected politically motivated violence, including that of ETA; however it did not condemn the record of ETA nor ask for the disbandment of the armed organization. Sortu was banned in March 2011 from registering as a political party by the Supreme Court of Spain.

Some members went on to form another party called Bildu, which was first banned but then allowed to register. Currently, it is Bildu which represents at the Parliament the electoral base of Batasuna.

==Reaction==

In October 2008, demonstrations were held in Bilbao to protest a Supreme Court decision the month before to ban ANV and EHAK, because of their ties to Batasuna. The protesters had a banner that read &quot;Freedom for Euskal Herria.&quot; The protests was organised by left-wing Basque nationalists. ANV president, Kepa Bereziartua, and the former spokesman for Batasuna, Arnaldo Otegi, were present in the march.

==Rulings of the European Court of Human Rights==

At the time of its outlawing in Spain, Batasuna lawyers took the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). After a long legal inquiry, in July 2009 the ECHR backed the Spanish rulings banning Batasuna and its proxies.

The ECHR said that disbanding the parties was a response &quot;to a pressing social need&quot; given their ties to ETA. &quot;Given the situation in Spain for several years regarding terrorist attacks, these ties can be considered objectively as a threat to democracy,&quot; the court said, also adding that these parties &quot;contradicted the concept of a &#x27;democratic society&#x27; and presented a major danger to Spain&#x27;s democracy&quot;.

Similarly, when the outlawed Batasuna tried to use Acción Nacionalista Vasca as a proxy to re-organize its ranks, in a different case the ECHR also upheld in 2011 the previous Spanish court rulings which had outlawed ANV, noting that this party had not run by itself in elections since 1977 and that it basically conformed a &quot;fraud&quot; to circumvent the outlawing of Batasuna.

== Status in France ==

Batasuna has a minor presence in the Basque French country, where it runs elections as a civic organization, not like a political party. In France it used to get a few hundred votes
and did not reach any kind of representation at either local or regional level so far.

In September 2008, 14 people were detained by the French police, 10 of whom were from the French-wing of the party (including their spokesman Xabi Larralde), and charged with links to ETA. They were released four days later; it remained unclear whether the ongoing investigation would lead to an illegalization process similar to that in Spain.

In January 2013, Batasuna in France announced its self-dissolution, citing a process of &quot;political reflection&quot;.

<text>In biogeography, a land bridge is an isthmus or wider land connection between otherwise separate areas, over which animals and plants are able to cross and colonize new lands. A land bridge can be created by marine regression, in which sea levels fall, exposing shallow, previously submerged sections of continental shelf; or when new land is created by plate tectonics; or occasionally when the sea floor rises due to post-glacial rebound after an ice age.

== Prominent examples ==


=== Former land bridges ===

* The Bassian Plain, which linked Australia to Tasmania
* The Bering Land Bridge (aka Beringia), which intermittently connected Alaska (Northern America) with Siberia (North Asia) as sea levels rose and fell under the effect of ice ages
* Land bridges of Japan, several land bridges which connected Japan to Russia and Korea at various times in history
* De Geer Land Bridge, a route that connected Fennoscandia to northern Greenland
* Doggerland, a former landmass in the southern North Sea which connected the island of Great Britain to continental Europe during the last ice age
* The Thule Land Bridge, a now-vanished land bridge between the British Isles and Greenland
* Torres Strait land bridge, Sahul, between modern-day West Papua and Cape York
* Sundaland, a 1,800,000 km2 area which connected the islands of Southeast Asia at various points during the last 2.6 million years

=== Current land bridges ===
*Adam&#x27;s Bridge (also known as Rama Setu), connecting India and Sri Lanka
*The Isthmus of Panama, whose appearance three million years ago allowed the Great American Biotic Interchange between North America and South America
*The Sinai Peninsula, linking Africa and Eurasia

== Land bridge theory ==

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, vanished land bridges were an explanation for observed affinities of plants and animals in distant locations. Such scientists as Joseph Dalton Hooker noted puzzling geological, botanical, and zoological similarities between widely separated areas, and proposed land bridges between appropriate land masses that allowed species to spread between land masses. In geology, the concept was first proposed by Jules Marcou in &quot;Lettres sur les roches du Jura et leur distribution géographique dans les deux hémisphères&quot; (&quot;Letters on the rocks of the Jura [Mountains] and their geographic distribution in the two hemispheres&quot;), 1857–1860.

Hypothesized land bridges included:
* &quot;Archatlantis&quot; from the West Indies to North Africa 
* &quot;Archhelenis&quot; from Brazil to South Africa
* &quot;Archiboreis&quot; in the North Atlantic
* &quot;Archigalenis&quot; from Central America through Hawaii to Northeast Asia
* &quot;Archinotis&quot; from South America to Antarctica
* &quot;Lemuria&quot; in the Indian Ocean

The theory of continental drift provided an alternate explanation that did not require land bridges. However the continental drift theory was not widely accepted until the development of plate tectonics in the early 1960s, which more completely explained the motion of continents over geological time.

<text>The Chicago Times was a newspaper in Chicago from 1854 to 1895, when it merged with the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;, to become the Chicago Times-Herald. The &quot;Times-Herald&quot; effectively disappeared in 1901 when it merged with the &quot;Chicago Record&quot; to become the &quot;Chicago Record-Herald&quot;.

The &quot;Times&quot; was founded in 1854 by James W. Sheahan, Daniel Cameron, and Isaac Cook with the support of Democrat and attorney Stephen A. Douglas, and was identified as a pro-slavery newspaper. In 1861, after the paper was purchased by Democratic journalist Wilbur F. Storey, the &quot;Times&quot; began espousing the Copperhead point of view, supporting Southern Democrats and denouncing the policies of Abraham Lincoln. During the Civil War, General Ambrose Burnside, head of the Department of the Ohio, suppressed the paper in 1863 because of its hostility to the Union cause, but Lincoln lifted the ban when he received word of it.

Storey and Joseph Medill, editor of the Republican-leaning &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, maintained a strong rivalry for some time. In 1888, the newspaper saw the brief addition of Finley Peter Dunne to its staff. Dunne was a columnist whose Mr. Dooley satires won him national recognition. After just one year, Dunne left the &quot;Times&quot; to work for the rival &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

In 1895, the &quot;Times&quot; became the Chicago Times-Herald after a merger with the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot;, a newspaper founded in 1881 by James W. Scott. After Scott&#x27;s sudden death in the weeks following the merger, H. H. Kohlsaat took over the new paper. He changed its direction from a &quot;democratic&quot; publication to an &quot;independent republican&quot; one. It supported &quot;sound money&quot; policies (against free silver) in the 1896 election.

Kohlsaat bought the &quot;Chicago Record&quot; from &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; publisher Victor F. Lawson in 1901 and merged it with the &quot;Times-Herald&quot; to form the &quot;Chicago Record-Herald&quot;. Frank B. Noyes acquired an interest in the new newspaper at the time and served as publisher, with Kohlsaat as editor.

<text>The East Indies (or simply the Indies) is a term used in historical narratives of the Age of Discovery. The &quot;Indies&quot; broadly referred to various lands in the East or the Eastern Hemisphere, particularly the islands and mainlands found in and around the Indian Ocean by Portuguese explorers, soon after the Cape Route was discovered. In a narrow sense, the term was used to refer to the Malay Archipelago, which today comprises the Philippine Archipelago, Indonesian Archipelago, Borneo, and New Guinea. Historically, the term was used in the Age of Discovery to refer to the coasts of the landmasses comprising the Indian subcontinent and the Indochinese Peninsula along with the Malay Archipelago.

==Overview==

During the era of European colonization, territories of the Spanish Empire in Asia were known as the Spanish East Indies for 333 years before the American conquest and later the independence of the Philippines. Dutch occupied colonies in the area were known for about 300 years as the Dutch East Indies until Indonesian independence. The East Indies may also include the former French Indochina, former British territories Brunei, Hong Kong and Singapore and former Portuguese Macau and Timor. It does not, however, include the former Dutch New Guinea, which is geographically considered to be part of Melanesia.

The inhabitants of the East Indies are never called &quot;East Indians&quot;, as they are not linguistically related to South Asia, most specifically the Indo-Aryan languages. It distinguishes them both from inhabitants of the Caribbean (which is also called the West Indies) and from the indigenous peoples of the Americas who are often called &quot;American Indians&quot;. However, in colonial times, the non-Indian Southeast Asians were also called &quot;Indians&quot;.

Peoples of the East Indies comprise a wide variety of cultural diversity, and the inhabitants do not consider themselves as belonging to a single ethnic group. The region is mostly populated by the Austronesians, who first expanded from the island of Taiwan, and later on during the early modern period, when East Asians such as the Han Chinese started to migrate south and became known as the Peranakans or Straits Chinese.

Buddhism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism are the most popular religions throughout the region, while Sikhism, Jainism, Chinese folk religion and various other traditional beliefs and practices are also prominent in some areas. The major languages in this area draw from a wide variety of language families such as the Austronesian and Sino-Tibetan languages, and should not be confused with the term Indo-Aryan, a group of languages spoken in the Indian subcontinent. Speakers of Austroasiatic, Tai–Kadai, and Hmong–Mien languages also live in the region.

Regions of the East Indies are sometimes known by the colonial empire they once belonged to, hence, &quot;Spanish East Indies&quot; means the Philippines, &quot;Dutch East Indies&quot; means Indonesia, and &quot;British East Indies&quot; refers to Malaysia.

Historically, the king of Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia) was identified with &quot;Prester John of the Indies&quot;, since that part of the world was imagined to be one of &quot;Three Indias&quot;.

==History==
Exploration of the &quot;East Indies&quot; by European powers began in the last three years of the 15th century and continued into the 16th century, led by the Portuguese explorers. The Portuguese described the entire region they discovered as the &quot;Indies&quot;. Eventually, the region would be broken up into a series of &quot;Indies&quot;: The East Indies, which was also called &quot;Old Indies&quot; or &quot;Great Indies&quot;, consisting of India, and the West Indies, also called &quot;New Indies&quot; or &quot;Little Indies&quot;, consisting of the Americas.

These regions were important sources of trading goods, particularly cotton, indigo and spices after the establishment of European trading companies: the British East India Company and Dutch East India Company, among others, in the 17th century.

The New World was initially thought to be the easternmost part of the &quot;Indies&quot; by explorer Christopher Columbus, who had grossly underestimated the westerly distance from Europe to Asia. Later, to avoid confusion, the New World came to be called the &quot;West Indies&quot;, while the original Indies came to be called the &quot;East Indies&quot;.

The designation &quot;East Indian&quot; was once primarily used to describe people of all of the East Indies, in order to avoid the potential confusion from the term American Indian who were once simply referred to as &quot;Indians&quot; (see the Native American name controversy for more information).

<doc id="76492" wikidata="Q25826" url="?curid=76492" title="IBM 704">
<text>The IBM 704 is the model name of a large digital mainframe computer introduced by IBM in 1954. Designed by John Backus and Gene Amdahl, it was the first mass-produced computer with hardware for floating-point arithmetic. The IBM 704 &quot;Manual of operation&quot; states: 

The type 704 Electronic Data-Processing Machine is a large-scale, high-speed electronic calculator controlled by an internally stored program of the single address type.
The 704 at that time was thus regarded as &quot;pretty much the only computer that could handle complex math&quot;. The 704 was a significant improvement over the earlier IBM 701 in terms of architecture and implementation. Like the 701, the 704 used vacuum-tube logic circuitry, but increased the instruction size from 18 bits to 36 bits, the same as the memory&#x27;s word size. Changes from the 701 include the use of magnetic-core memory instead of Williams tubes, floating-point arithmetic instructions, 15-bit addressing and the addition of three index registers. To support these new features, the instructions were expanded to use the full 36-bit word. The new instruction set, which is not compatible with the 701, became the base for the &quot;scientific architecture&quot; subclass of the IBM 700/7000 series computers.

The 704 could execute up to 12,000 floating-point additions per second. IBM produced 123 type 704 systems between 1955 and 1960.

==Landmarks==
The programming languages FORTRAN and LISP were first developed for the 704, as was the SAP assembler—&quot;Symbolic Assembly Program&quot;, later distributed by SHARE as &quot;SHARE Assembly Program&quot;.

MUSIC, the first computer music program, was developed on the IBM 704 by Max Mathews.

In 1962, physicist John Larry Kelly, Jr. created one of the most famous moments in the history of Bell Labs by using an IBM 704 computer to synthesize speech. Kelly&#x27;s voice recorder synthesizer &quot;vocoder&quot; recreated the song &quot;Daisy Bell&quot;, with musical accompaniment from Max Mathews. Arthur C. Clarke was coincidentally visiting friend and colleague John Pierce at the Bell Labs Murray Hill facility at the time of this speech synthesis demonstration, and Clarke was so impressed that six years later he used it in the climactic scene of his novel and screenplay for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, where the &quot;HAL 9000&quot; computer sings the same song. (Bell Laboratories later released a recording, on ten-inch 78-RPM records, of speech and music created this way. It was apparently made with an IBM 7090, the solid-state successor to the 704.)

Edward O. Thorp, a math instructor at MIT, used the IBM 704 as a research tool to investigate the probabilities of winning while developing his blackjack gaming theory. He used FORTRAN to formulate the equations of his research model.

The IBM 704 at the MIT Computation Center was used as the official tracker for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Operation Moonwatch in the fall of 1957. IBM provided four staff scientists to aid Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory scientists and mathematicians in the calculation of satellite orbits: Dr. Giampiero Rossoni, Dr. John Greenstadt, Thomas Apple and Richard Hatch.

The IBM 704 was used for flight dynamics analyses of the NRL&#x27;s Vanguard rockets. 

The Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) developed an early monitor named &quot;SLAM&quot; to enable batch processing.

==Registers==

The IBM 704 had a 38-bit accumulator, a 36-bit multiplier/quotient register, and three 15-bit index registers. The contents of the index registers are subtracted from the base address, so the index registers are also called &quot;decrement registers&quot;. All three index registers can participate in an instruction: the 3-bit &quot;tag&quot; field in the instruction is a bit map specifying which of the registers participate in the operation. However, when more than one index register is selected, then their contents are bit-wise ORed – not added – together before the decrement takes place. This behavior persisted in later scientific-architecture machines (such as the IBM 709 and IBM 7090) until the IBM 7094. The IBM 7094, introduced in 1962, increased the number of index registers to seven and only selected one at a time; the &quot;or&quot; behavior remained available in a compatibility mode of the IBM 7094.

==Instruction and data formats==
There are two instruction formats, referred to as &quot;Type A&quot; and &quot;Type B&quot;. Most instructions were of type B.

Type A instructions have, in sequence, a 3-bit &quot;prefix&quot; (instruction code), a 15-bit &quot;decrement&quot; field, a 3-bit &quot;tag&quot; field, and a 15-bit &quot;address&quot; field. There are conditional jump operations based on the values in the index registers specified in the &quot;tag&quot; field. Some instructions also subtract the &quot;decrement&quot; field from the contents of the index registers. The implementation requires that the second two bits of the instruction code be non-zero, giving a total of six possible type A instructions. One (STR, instruction code binary 101) was not implemented until the IBM 709.

Type B instructions have, in sequence, a 12-bit instruction code (with bits 2 and 3 set to 0 to distinguish them from type A instructions), a 2-bit &quot;flag&quot; field, four unused bits, a 3-bit &quot;tag&quot; field, and a 15-bit &quot;address&quot; field.

* Fixed-point numbers are stored in binary sign/magnitude format.
* Single-precision floating-point numbers have a magnitude sign, an 8-bit excess-128 exponent and a 27-bit fraction (no hidden bit).
* Alphanumeric characters were usually 6-bit BCD, packed six to a word.

The instruction set implicitly subdivides the data format into the same fields as type A instructions: prefix, decrement, tag and address. Instructions exist to modify each of these fields in a data word without changing the remainder of the word, though the &quot;Store Tag&quot; instruction was not implemented on the IBM 704.

The original implementation of Lisp uses the &quot;address&quot; and &quot;decrement&quot; fields to store the head and tail of a linked list respectively. The primitive functions &quot;car&quot; (&quot;contents of the address part of register&quot;) and &quot;cdr&quot; (&quot;contents of the decrement part of register&quot;) were named after these fields.

==Memory and peripherals==

Controls are included in the 704 for: one 711 Punched Card Reader, one 716 Alphabetic Printer, one 721 Punched Card Recorder, five 727 Magnetic Tape Units and one 753 Tape Control Unit, one 733 Magnetic Drum Reader and Recorder, and one 737 Magnetic Core Storage Unit. Total weight was about .

The 704 itself came with a control console having 36 assorted control switches or buttons and 36 data-input switches, one for each bit in a register. The control console essentially allows only setting the binary values of the registers with switches and seeing the binary state of the registers displayed in the pattern of many small neon lamps, appearing much like modern LEDs. For human interaction with the computer, programs would be entered on punched cards initially rather than at the console, and human-readable output would be directed to the printer. 

The IBM 740 Cathode Ray Tube Output Recorder was also available, which is a 21-inch vector display with a very long phosphor persistence time of 20 seconds for human viewing, together with a 7-inch display receiving the same signal as the larger display but with a fast-decaying phosphor designed to be photographed with an attached camera. 

The 737 Magnetic Core Storage Unit serves as RAM and provides 4,096 36-bit words, the equivalent of 18,432 bytes. The 727 Magnetic Tape Units store over 5 million 6-bit characters per reel.

==Reliability==
The IBM 704 was much more reliable than its predecessor, the IBM 701, which had a mean time between failure of around 30 minutes. Being a vacuum-tube machine, however, the IBM 704 had very poor reliability by today&#x27;s standards. On average, the machine failed around every 8 hours, comparable to the Manchester Mark 1 in 1949. This limited the program size that the first Fortran compilers could successfully translate because the machine would fail before a successful compilation of a large program.

<text>Max von Sydow (,; born Carl Adolf von Sydow; 10 April 1929 – 8 March 2020) was a Swedish actor. He had a 70-year career in European and American cinema, television, and theatre, appearing in more than 150 films and several television series in multiple languages. Capable in roles ranging from stolid, contemplative protagonists to sardonic artists and menacing, often gleeful villains, von Sydow received numerous accolades including honors from the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival. He was nominated for two Academy Awards: for Best Actor for &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; (1987) and for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close&quot; (2011).

Von Sydow was first noticed internationally for playing the 14th-century knight Antonius Block in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (1957), which features iconic scenes of his character challenging Death to a game of chess. He appeared in eleven films directed by Bergman, including &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (1957), &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (1960), &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (1961), &quot;Winter Light&quot; (1963), &quot;Shame&quot; (1968), and &quot;The Touch&quot; (1971).

Von Sydow made his American film debut as Jesus Christ in the Biblical epic film &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965) and went on to star in films such as &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982) and the James Bond adaptation &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983). He also appeared in supporting roles in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot; (2007), &quot;Shutter Island&quot; (2010), &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2010), and &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015). He portrayed the main antagonist Leland Gaunt (The Devil) in the film adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Needful Things&quot; (1993). In 2016, he portrayed the Three-eyed Raven in the HBO fantasy series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

Von Sydow received the Royal Foundation of Sweden&#x27;s Cultural Award in 1954, was made a Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres in 2005, and was named a Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur on 17 October 2012.

==Early life==
Carl Adolf von Sydow was born on 10 April 1929 in Lund, Sweden. His father, Carl Wilhelm von Sydow, was an ethnologist and professor of folkloristics at Lund University. His mother, Baroness Maria Margareta Rappe, was a schoolteacher. Sydow was of part-German ancestry. A paternal ancestor, David Sydow (&quot;von&quot; or &quot;Von&quot; was added later to the family name), emigrated from Pomerania to the Kalmar region in 1724. His mother was also of part-Pomeranian descent. Sydow was raised as a Lutheran, but became an agnostic in the 1970s.

Sydow attended Lund Cathedral School, where he learned English at an early age. Originally expected to pursue a career in law, he became interested in acting after seeing a production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; during a class trip to Malmö, which prompted him to establish an amateur theatrical group along with his friends back at school.

Sydow served for two years in the Swedish Army with the Army Quartermaster Corps, where he adopted the name &quot;Max&quot; from the star performer of a flea circus he saw. After completing his service, Sydow studied at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm where he trained between 1948 and 1951. During his time at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, he helped start a theatre group, of which actress Ingrid Thulin was a member. He made his stage debut in a small part in the Goethe play &quot;Egmont&quot;, which he considered &quot;almost a disaster,&quot; but received good reviews for his performance.

==Career==

===Early career===

While at the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Sydow made his screen debuts in Alf Sjöberg&#x27;s films &quot;Only a Mother&quot; (&#x27;, 1949) and &quot;Miss Julie&quot; (&#x27;, 1951). In 1951, Sydow joined the Norrköping-Linköping Municipal Theatre, appearing in nine plays including &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;. In 1953, he moved on to the City Theatre in Hälsingborg (Helsingborg), playing eleven parts in a two-year stint, including Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; and the title role of the Pirandello play &quot;Henry IV&quot;. Sydow&#x27;s theatrical work won him critical recognition, and in 1954 he received the Royal Foundation of Sweden&#x27;s Cultural Award, a grant to young, promising actors.

===1955–1960s===
In 1955, Sydow moved to Malmö and joined the Malmö City Theatre, whose chief director at the time was Ingmar Bergman. Sydow had previously sought to play a small part in Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Prison&quot; (&#x27;, 1949), but the director rejected the proposition. Bergman and Sydow&#x27;s first film was &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (&#x27;, 1957), in which Sydow portrayed Antonius Block, a disillusioned 14th-century knight returning from the Crusades to a plague-stricken Sweden. The scene of his character playing a game of chess with Death has come to be regarded as an iconic moment in cinema. Sydow went on to appear in a total of 11 Bergman films. In &quot;The Magician&quot; (&#x27;, 1958), Sydow starred as Vogler, a 19th-century traveling illusionist who remains silent for most of the film. In &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot; (&#x27;, 1960), he played a medieval landowner who takes vengeance on the men who raped and murdered his daughter. In &quot;Through a Glass Darkly&quot; (&#x27;, 1961), he portrayed the husband of a schizophrenic woman, played by Harriet Andersson. During this period, he also had roles in films including &quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; (&#x27;, 1957), &quot;Brink of Life&quot; (&#x27;, 1958) and &quot;Winter Light&quot; (&#x27;, 1963). Films starring Sydow were submitted by Sweden for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in five out of six years between 1957 and 1962. Under Bergman, Sydow also continued his stage career, playing Brick in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, Peer in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, Alceste in &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; and Faust in &quot;Urfaust&quot;. In his company were Gunnar Björnstrand, Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom, all frequent collaborators of Bergman on screen.
Despite his rising profile, Sydow limited his work exclusively to Sweden early in his career, constantly refusing offers to work outside the country. He was first approached at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival to act in U.S. films, but refused the proposition, saying that he was &quot;content in Sweden&quot; and &quot;had no intention of starting an international career&quot;. He also refused the opportunity to play the title role for &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) and Captain von Trapp in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965). In 1965, Sydow finally accepted George Stevens&#x27;s offer and made his international debut, playing Christ in the epic &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. He accepted the part against the advice of Bergman, spent six months at the University of California, Los Angeles, preparing for the role, and adopted a Mid-Atlantic accent. The film introduced Sydow to a wider audience, but ultimately performed below expectations at the box office. He went on to play a crop-dusting pilot in &quot;The Reward&quot; (1965) and a fanatic missionary in &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966). For his performance in &quot;Hawaii&quot;, Sydow received his first Golden Globe nomination. To his own frustration, however, Sydow would become frequently cast in villainous roles, such as a neo-Nazi aristocrat in &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966), a Russian colonel in &quot;The Kremlin Letter&quot; (1970), a meticulous and elegant international assassin in &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975), Emperor Ming the Merciless in &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980) and James Bond&#x27;s nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983).

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Sydow was often paired with Liv Ullmann in Bergman films. In 1968&#x27;s &quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot; (&#x27;), Sydow played an artist living on an isolated island with his pregnant wife, played by Ullmann. In the same year, the two appeared in the drama &quot;Shame&quot; (&#x27;), about a couple (both former musicians) living on a farm on an island during a war. Sydow and Ullmann returned for the 1969 Bergman film &quot;The Passion of Anna&quot; (&#x27;). In 1971 and 1972, Sydow again starred alongside Ullmann in the Jan Troell epic duology, &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (&#x27;) &quot;The New Land&quot; (&quot;&quot;), the story of a Swedish peasant family that emigrates to America in the mid-19th century.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1971, Sydow starred in &quot;The Touch&quot;, Bergman&#x27;s first English-language film, playing a doctor whose wife is having an affair. In 1973, Sydow appeared in one of his most commercially successful films, William Friedkin&#x27;s &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973). He played Father Lankester Merrin, the film&#x27;s titular Jesuit priest, which earned him his second Golden Globe nomination. He reprised the role in the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977). In 1977, Sydow made his Broadway debut alongside Eileen Atkins and Bibi Andersson in Per Olov Enquist&#x27;s &quot;The Night of the Tribades&quot;, a play about the writer August Strindberg. In 1981, he starred with Anne Bancroft in the Tom Kempinski play &quot;Duet for One&quot; about the cellist Jacqueline du Pré. Sydow made his British stage debut at The Old Vic in 1988 as Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot;, a role he had first played in Sweden three decades before.

In the 1980s, in addition to &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, Sydow appeared in John Milius&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982), Jan Troell&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Eagle&quot; (1982), Rick Moranis&#x27;s &amp; Dave Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Strange Brew&quot; (1983), David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986). In 1985, Sydow was a member of the jury at the 35th Berlin International Film Festival. In the 1987 Bille August film &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot;, Sydow portrayed an impoverished Swedish labourer who brought his son to Denmark to try to build a better life for themselves. The role won him international acclaim and is often considered one of the best roles in his career. For his performance, Sydow received a Best Actor nomination at the 61st Academy Awards; the film won Best Foreign Language Film as Denmark&#x27;s official Oscar entry. 

In 1988, Sydow made his only directorial foray with &quot;Katinka&quot;, a film based on the Herman Bang novel, &quot;Ved Vejen&quot;. The film won the Guldbagge Awards for Best Film and Best Director but was not widely seen outside Sweden. In 1989, Sydow appeared in the television film &quot;Red King, White Knight&quot;, for which he received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination. He also supplied the voice for Vigo the Carpathian in the 1989 film, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;.

===1990s–2000s===
Sydow and Bergman did not work together for an extended period. A part in Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Fanny and Alexander&quot; (1982) was specifically written for Sydow, but his agent demanded too large a salary. Sydow came to regret missing out on the role. The two did eventually reunite in 1991 with &quot;The Best Intentions&quot;, directed by Bille August with a script from Bergman. In 1996, Sydow made his final appearance in a Bergman film, &quot;Private Confessions&quot;, directed by Liv Ullmann and written by Bergman. In 1997, Sydow played Nobel Prize-winning Norwegian novelist and Nazi sympathizer Knut Hamsun in the biopic &quot;Hamsun&quot;. Throughout the rest of the 1990s, Sydow also appeared in films such as &quot;Father&quot; (1990), &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990), &quot;Until the End of the World&quot; (1991), &quot;Needful Things&quot; (1993), &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; (1995) and &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; (1999). For his performance in &quot;Father&quot;, Sydow won the Australian Film Institute Best Actor Award.

In 2002, Sydow acted in one of his biggest commercial successes, playing the PreCrime director opposite Tom Cruise in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s science fiction thriller &quot;Minority Report&quot;. In 2004, Sydow appeared in a television adaptation of the &quot;Ring of the Nibelung&quot; saga. The show set ratings records and was later released in the United States as &quot;Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King&quot;. In 2007, he starred in the box-office hit &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; as one of the antagonists opposite Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, and played the father of the protagonist in &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;, Julian Schnabel&#x27;s adaptation of the memoir by Jean-Dominique Bauby. In 2009, Sydow appeared in the drama series &quot;The Tudors&quot;.

===2010s===

In 2010, Sydow played a sinister German doctor in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, and Robin Hood&#x27;s blind stepfather Sir Walter Loxley in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. He received his second Academy Award nomination for his performance as a mute elderly renter in Stephen Daldry&#x27;s &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot; (2011), based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer.

In April 2013, Sydow was honored at the Turner Classic Movie (TCM) Festival in Hollywood, with screenings of two of his classic films, &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; and &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;.

In March 2014, Sydow provided the voice of an art forger named in &quot;The War of Art&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In 2015, he played the explorer Lor San Tekka in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. In 2016, he joined the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; as the Three-eyed Raven. For his performance, Sydow received his second Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

In addition to his film and television work, Sydow also made forays into video games. He voiced Esbern, a mentor of the protagonist in &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot; (2011), and narrated the game&#x27;s debut trailer. He also lent his voice to the 2009 game &quot;&quot; and reprised his role as Lor San Tekka in &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; (2016).

In 2018, Sydow appeared in Thomas Vinterberg&#x27;s film &quot;Kursk&quot;, also known as &quot;The Command&quot;, based on the true story of the Kursk submarine disaster.

His final role was in Nicholas Dimitropoulos&#x27; war drama &quot;Echoes of the Past&quot; (2021). He portrayed Nicolas Andreou, one of the last living survivors of the Kalavryta massacre of 1943 committed by Nazi troops during the Axis occupation of Greece.

==Personal life==
Max von Sydow married actress Christina Inga Britta Olin in 1951. They had two sons. The couple divorced in 1979. Von Sydow married French documentarian Catherine Brelet in 1997 and adopted Brelet&#x27;s two adult sons from her previous marriage.

Sydow relocated to Paris following his marriage to Brelet. In 2002, he became a citizen of France, at which time he had to relinquish his Swedish citizenship.

Sydow was reported to be either an agnostic or an atheist. In 2012, he told Charlie Rose in an interview that Ingmar Bergman had told him he would contact him after death to show him that there was a life after death. When Rose asked Sydow if he had heard from Bergman, he replied that he had but chose not to elaborate further on the exact meaning of this statement. In the same interview, he described himself as a doubter in his youth but stated this doubt was gone and indicated he came to agree with Bergman&#x27;s belief in the afterlife.

==Death==
Max von Sydow died on 8 March 2020 at his home in Provence, France, at age 90.

== Filmography ==
== Awards and nominations ==
He was nominated for two Academy Awards, for his performances in Bille August&#x27;s &quot;Pelle the Conqueror&quot; (1987) and Stephen Daldry&#x27;s &quot;Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close&quot; (2011).

<doc id="76500" wikidata="Q237235" url="?curid=76500" title="Edith Pargeter">
<text>Edith Mary Pargeter (28 September 1913 – 14 October 1995), also known by her pen name Ellis Peters, was an English author of works in many categories, especially history and historical fiction, and was also honoured for her translations of Czech classics. She is probably best known for her murder mysteries, both historical and modern, and especially for her medieval detective series The Cadfael Chronicles.

==Personal==
Pargeter was born in the village of Horsehay (Shropshire, England), daughter of Edmund Valentine Pargeter (known as Ted) and his wife Edith &quot;nee&quot; Hordley. Her father was a clerk at the local Horsehay Company ironworks. She later moved with her parents to Dawley where she was educated at Dawley Church of England School and the old Coalbrookdale High School for Girls. She had Welsh ancestry, and many of her short stories and books (both fiction and non-fiction) are set in Wales and its borderlands, or have Welsh protagonists.

After leaving school she worked as a temporary labour exchange clerk, then as an assistant at a chemist&#x27;s shop in Dawley, during which time her first novel, &quot;Hortensius, Friend of Nero&quot;, was published in 1936. During World War II, she enlisted in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (the &quot;Wrens&quot;) in 1940. She worked in an administrative role as a teleprinter operator at Devonport, and then at the Western Approaches Headquarters at Derby House, Liverpool. She reached the rank of petty officer by 1 January 1944 when she was awarded the British Empire Medal (BEM) in the New Year Honours.

In 1947 Pargeter visited Czechoslovakia in a Workers&#x27; Educational Association party and became fascinated by the Czech language and culture. She wrote two books about then-Czechoslovakia: &quot;The Fair Young Phoenix&quot; and &quot;The Coast of Bohemia&quot;. She became fluent in Czech and published award-winning translations of Czech poetry and prose into English. She translated books by Jan Neruda, Božena Němcová, and Karel Hynek Mácha, as well as books by 20th-century writers such as Bohumil Hrabal, Ivan Klíma, Ladislav Vančura, and Nobel Prize Laureate in Literature, the poet Jaroslav Seifert.

She was an active Labour Party supporter until, with her brother Ellis Pargeter (a local councillor in Dawley), she left the party in 1949 because they believed that it had deserted socialist principles.

==Writing career==
She devoted the rest of her life to writing, both nonfiction and well-researched fiction. She never attended university but became a self-taught scholar in areas that interested her, especially Shropshire and Wales. Birmingham University gave her an honorary master&#x27;s degree. She never married, but did fall in love with a Czech man. She remained friends with him after he married another woman. She was pleased that she could support herself with her writing from the time after the Second World War until her death.

Pargeter wrote under a number of pseudonyms; it was under the name Ellis Peters that she wrote her later crime stories, especially the highly popular series of Brother Cadfael medieval mysteries, featuring a Benedictine monk at the Abbey in Shrewsbury. That pseudonym was drawn from the name of her brother, Ellis, and a version of the name of the daughter of friends, Petra. Many of the novels were made into films for television. Although she won her first award for a novel written in 1963, her greatest fame and sales came with the &quot;Cadfael Chronicles&quot;, which began in 1977. At the time that the 19th novel was published, sales of the series exceeded 6.5 million. The &quot;Cadfael Chronicles&quot; drew international attention to Shrewsbury and its history, and greatly increased tourism to the town. In an interview in 1993, she mentioned her own work before the Second World War as a chemist&#x27;s assistant, where they prepared many of the compounds they sold. &quot;We used to make bottled medicine that we compounded specially, with ingredients like gentian, rosemary, horehound. You never see that nowadays; those tinctures are never prescribed. They often had bitters of some sort in them, a taste I rather liked. Some of Cadfael&#x27;s prescriptions come out of those years.&quot;

Her Cadfael novels show great appreciation for the ideals of medieval Catholic Christianity, but also a recognition of its weaknesses, such as quarrels over the finer points of theology (&quot;The Heretic&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;), and the desire of the church to own more and more land and wealth (&quot;Monk&#x27;s Hood&quot;, &quot;Saint Peter&#x27;s Fair&quot;, &quot;The Rose Rent&quot;).

==Later life==
In 1992 her mobility began to decline after a fall during a service being televised for &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; at Shrewsbury Abbey. She had a further fall in 1994 at home that led to the amputation of a leg at Princess Royal Hospital, Telford.

She died at her last home in Glendinning Way, Madeley, Shropshire, in October 1995 at the age of 82, having recently returned home from hospital following a stroke. On 14 September 1997, a new stained glass window depicting St Benedict was installed in Shrewsbury Abbey and was dedicated to the memory of Edith Pargeter, with funds raised by donations from admirers of the author.

She is remembered in her home town with a residential road named after her. Ellis Peters Drive sits off Southall Road between Aqueduct and Brookside in Telford.

==Recognition==
The Mystery Writers of America gave Pargeter their Edgar Award in 1963 for &quot;Death and the Joyful Woman&quot;. In 1980, the British Crime Writers Association awarded her the Silver Dagger for &quot;Monk&#x27;s Hood&quot;. In 1993 she won the Cartier Diamond Dagger, an annual award given by the CWA to authors who have made an outstanding lifetime contribution to the field of crime and mystery writing. Pargeter was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) &quot;for services to Literature&quot; in the 1994 New Year Honours. To commemorate Pargeter&#x27;s life and work, in 1999 the CWA established their Ellis Peters Historical Dagger award (later called the Ellis Peters Historical Award) for the best historical crime novel of the year.

Pargeter&#x27;s &quot;Cadfael Chronicles&quot; are often credited for popularizing what would later become known as the historical mystery.

<text>The Solway Firth is an inlet on the west coast of Great Britain, forming part of the border between England and Scotland. The &quot;firth&quot; (a Scottish term for inlets of the sea) divides Cumbria (including the Solway Plain) from Dumfries and Galloway. It stretches from St Bees Head, just south of Whitehaven in Cumbria, to the Mull of Galloway, on the western end of Dumfries and Galloway. The Isle of Man is also very near to the firth. The firth comprises part of the Irish Sea.

The firth&#x27;s coastline is characterised by lowland hills and small mountains. It is a mainly rural area, with mostly small villages and settlements (such as Powfoot). Fishing, hill farming, and some arable farming play a large part in the local economy, although tourism is increasing.

The northern part of the English coast of the Solway Firth was designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, known as the Solway Coast, in 1964. Construction of the Robin Rigg Wind Farm in the firth began in 2007.

Within the firth, there are some salt flats and mud flats that can be dangerous, due to their frequently shifting patches of quicksand.

==Wildlife==
There are over of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in the area of the firth (one of which is Salta Moss), as well as national nature reserves — at Caerlaverock and in Cumbria. On the Cumbrian side, much of the coastline has been designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The Solway Coast’s AONB has two separate sections: the first runs westward from just north of Carlisle to Skinburness; the second runs south from the hamlet of Beckfoot, past Mawbray and Allonby, to Crosscanonby.

In 2013, the honeycomb worm and blue mussel were designated as targets of conservation efforts, and Allonby Bay (an inlet of the Solway Firth) was put forward as a candidate for a Marine Conservation Zone.

==Long-distance walking route==
A long-distance walking route, the Annandale Way, runs through Annandale, from the source of the River Annan, in the Moffat Hills, to the Solway Firth; it was opened in September 2009.

==Islands in the Solway==
Unlike other parts of the west coast of Scotland, the Solway Firth has only a few islands. They are:
* Hestan Island
* Rough Island
* Little Ross
* The so-called Isle of Whithorn (which is actually a peninsula).
*The Islands of Fleet

== Rivers ==
The Solway Firth is the estuary of the River Eden and the River Esk.

Below are links to lists of the other rivers that flow into the firth:
*in England
*in Scotland

==History==

The name &#x27;Solway&#x27; (recorded as &quot;Sulewad&quot; in 1218) is of Scandinavian origin, and was originally the name of a ford across the mud flats at Eskmouth. The first element of the name is probably from the Old Norse word &#x27;pillar&#x27;, referring to the Lochmaben Stane, though it may instead be from , meaning &#x27;solan goose&#x27;. and both have long vowels, but the early spellings of Solway indicate a short vowel in the first element. This may be due to the shortening of an originally long vowel in the Middle English period but may also represent an original short vowel. If this is the case, the first element may be , an unrecorded word cognate with Old English &#x27;muddy, pool&#x27;, or a derivative of , meaning &#x27;to swill&#x27;.

The second element of the name is from the Old Norse , meaning &#x27;ford&#x27; (which is cognate with the modern English word &quot;wade&quot;).

The area had three fords: the Annan or Bowness Wath, the Dornock Wath (once called the Sandywathe), and the main one —the Solewath (also called the Solewath or the Sulewad).

A wooden lighthouse was built in 1841 at Barnkirk Point (). It was destroyed by fire in 1960.

On 9 March 1876, a 79-ton French lugger &quot;St. Pierre&quot;, was stranded - and finally declared lost - on Blackshaw Bank, an ill-defined feature which extends for a considerable distance on both sides of the channel of the River Nith.

Between 1869 and 1921, the estuary was crossed by the Solway Junction Railway on a 1780 m (5850 ft) iron viaduct. The line was built to carry iron ore from the Whitehaven area to Lanarkshire and was financed and operated by the Caledonian Railway of Scotland. After the railway, which was not a financial success, ceased operating in 1921, the railway bridge became a popular footpath, enabling residents of Scotland to easily cross into England, where alcoholic drink was legally available seven days a week. (Scotland was dry on Sundays at the time.) The viaduct was demolished between 1931 and 1933.

==Hazards==
The Ministry of Defence had by 1999 fired more than 6,350 depleted uranium rounds into the Solway Firth from its testing range at Dundrennan Range.

==In popular culture==
* The Solway Firth has been used as the location for films. For example, the 1973 film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was filmed around Kirkcudbright and Burrow Head on the Wigtownshire coast.
* In July 2019, the American metal band Slipknot released a song called “Solway Firth” that is named after the firth.

<doc id="76508" wikidata="Q211073" url="?curid=76508" title="Matadi">
<text>Matadi is the chief sea port of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the capital of the Kongo Central province, adjacent to the border with Angola. It had a population of 245,862 (2004). Matadi is situated on the left bank of the Congo River, from the mouth and below the last navigable point before the rapids that make the river impassable for a long stretch upriver.

==History==

Matadi was near the site of the state of Vungu, which was first mentioned in 1535 and was said to be destroyed in 1624.

Matadi itself was founded by Sir Henry Morton Stanley in 1879. It was strategically important because it was the last navigable port going upstream on the Congo River; it became the furthest inland port in the Congo Free State. The construction of the Matadi–Kinshasa Railway (built between 1890 and 1898) made it possible to transport goods from deeper within Congo&#x27;s interior to the port of Matadi, stimulating the city to become an important trading center. Portuguese and French West-African commercial interests influenced the city&#x27;s architecture and urban design, which borrowed from the neighboring colonies in Angola and the Congo-Brazzaville.

== Culture ==
The word &quot;Matadi&quot; means stone in the local Kikongo language. The town is built on steep hills. A local saying is that to live in Matadi, you must know the verbs &quot;to go up&quot;, &quot;to go down&quot;, and &quot;to sweat&quot;. Upstream is a series of caves known as the &quot;rock of Diogo Cão&quot;, after graffiti carved by the Portuguese explorer in 1485 marking the limit of his travels up the Congo River.

Yelala Rapids lies near the city.

== Climate ==
Matadi has a relatively dry tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;) with a lengthy dry season from June to September due to the northerly extension of the cold, foggy Benguela Current.
== Infrastructure ==
The mouth of the Congo forms one of Africa&#x27;s largest harbours. In addition to Matadi, which is the furthest upriver, three ports are located within it, the others being Boma and Banana in DR Congo and Soyo in Angola. Matadi serves as a major import and export point for the whole nation. Chief exports are coffee and timber. The state fishing company &quot;Pemarza&quot; uses the port to supply fish to Kinshasa. Tshimpi Airport is nearby but is reportedly inactive because of continued warfare.

In Matadi there is the famous Matadi Bridge, the only one along the entire lower and middle reaches of the huge Congo River. Therefore, the main transcontinental flow of cars from the vast northwestern part of Africa to the south of the African continent passes through Matadi.

Matadi Bridge, a suspension bridge 722 m- long with a main span of 520 m, built in 1983, crosses the river just south of Matadi, carrying the main road linking Kinshasa to the coast. After passing through Matadi and over the bridge, it continues to Boma, Muanda and Banana. Although built as a mixed rail and road bridge, no rail line is now operating over the bridge. Matadi is the port railhead for the 366 km long Matadi-Kinshasa Railway, constructed to bypass the rapids on the river upstream. A monument to the builders of the railway stands on a nearby hill.

A power station on the M&#x27;pozo River supplies power to Matadi.

== Port ==

The maximum draft of the port is 8.2m. The Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo maintains one operational command at the port.

Currently, larger ships are required to transfer cargo to smaller vessels in the Republic of Congo&#x27;s Pointe-Noire port. For this reason, the development of a deep-sea port at Port Banana was begun in 2022.

== Media ==
&quot;La Cité africaine de Matadi&quot; is a newspaper published in French in Matadi.

In Belgium, a small garden city in the Heverlee suburb of Leuven was named after Matadi in the 1920s.

<doc id="76511" wikidata="Q608132" url="?curid=76511" title="Scouting America">
<text>Scouting America is the largest scouting organization and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with over 1 million youth, including 176,000 female participants. Founded as the Boy Scouts of America in 1910, about 130 million Americans have participated in its programs, which are served by 477,000 adult volunteers. The organization became a founding member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922.

The stated mission of Scouting America is to &quot;prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.&quot; Youth are trained in responsible citizenship, character development, and self-reliance through participation in a wide range of outdoor activities, educational programs, and, at older age levels, career-oriented programs in partnership with community organizations. For younger members, the Scout method is part of the program to instill typical Scouting values such as trustworthiness, good citizenship, and outdoors skills, through a variety of activities such as camping, aquatics, and hiking. To further these outdoor activities, Scouting America owns four high-adventure bases: Northern Tier (Minnesota, Manitoba, and Ontario), Philmont Scout Ranch (New Mexico), Sea Base (Florida Keys, US Virgin Islands, and Bahamas), and Summit Bechtel Reserve (West Virginia), as well as nearly 100 camps and reservations dedicated to scouts.

The main Scouting divisions are Cub Scouts for ages 5 to 11 years, Scouts BSA for ages 10 to 18, Venturing for ages 14 through 21, and Sea Scouts for ages 14 through 21. Scouting America operates by chartering local organizations, such as churches, clubs, civic associations, or educational organizations, to implement the Scouting program for youth within their communities. Units are led by volunteers appointed by the chartering organization, who are supported by local councils using both paid professional Scouters and volunteers. Additionally, Learning for Life is an affiliate that provides in-school and career education.

In 2019, the Boy Scouts of America renamed its flagship program, Boy Scouts, to Scouts BSA to reflect its policy change allowing girls to join separate, gender-specific troops. Accordingly, on February 8, 2025, its 115th anniversary, the BSA changed its name to Scouting America. The Scout Oath, Law and program remain unchanged.

==Origins==
The progressive movement in the United States was at its height during the early 20th century. With the migration of families from farms to cities, there were concerns among some people that young men were no longer learning patriotism, self-reliance, and individualism. Several groups attempted to fill this void. The YMCA was an early promoter of reforms for young men with a focus on social welfare and programs of mental, physical, social and religious development. Others, included the Woodcraft Indians started by Ernest Thompson Seton in 1902 in Cos Cob, Connecticut, and the Sons of Daniel Boone founded by Daniel Carter Beard in 1905 in Cincinnati, Ohio., two notable independent scouting predecessors of BSA within the United States.
In 1907, Robert Baden-Powell founded the Scouting movement in England using elements of Seton&#x27;s works among other influences. In 1909, Chicago publisher W. D. Boyce was visiting London, where he encountered a boy who came to be known as the Unknown Scout. Boyce was lost on a foggy street when an unknown Scout came to his aid, guiding him to his destination. The boy then refused Boyce&#x27;s tip, explaining that he was a Boy Scout and was merely doing his daily good turn. Interested in the Boy Scouts, Boyce met with staff at the Boy Scouts Headquarters and, by some accounts, Baden-Powell. Upon his return to the US, Boyce was inspired by his experience and incorporated the &quot;Boy Scouts of America&quot; on February 8, 1910. Edgar M. Robinson and Lee F. Hanmer became interested in the nascent BSA and convinced Boyce to turn the program over to the YMCA for development in April 1910. Robinson enlisted Seton, Beard, Charles Eastman, and other prominent leaders in the early youth movements. Former president Theodore Roosevelt, who had long complained of the decline in American manhood, became an ardent supporter. In January 1911, Robinson turned the movement over to James E. West who became the first Chief Scout Executive and Scouting began to expand in the US Among other programs in the US, the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone, eventually merged with the BSA.

The BSA&#x27;s stated purpose at its incorporation in 1910 was &quot;to teach [boys] patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kindred values.&quot; Later, in 1937, Deputy Chief Scout Executive George J. Fisher expressed the BSA&#x27;s mission: &quot;Each generation as it comes to maturity has no more important duty than that of teaching high ideals and proper behavior to the generation which follows.&quot; The current mission statement of the BSA is &quot;to prepare young people to make ethical and moral choices over their lifetimes by instilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.&quot;

At its peak, Boy Scouts had an active membership of over 4 million youth in 1973. Today, popularity in outdoor events has waned and membership has dropped. However, Scouting America remains the largest scouting organization and one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with about 1.2 million youth participants and about one million adult volunteers .

===Federally chartered corporation===
Scouting America holds one of the comparatively rare congressional charters under Title 36 of the United States Code. On behalf of Scouting America, Paul Sleman, Colin H. Livingstone, Ernest S. Martin, and James E. West successfully lobbied Congress for a federal charter, which President Woodrow Wilson signed on June 15, 1916. One of the principal reasons for seeking a congressional charter was to deal with competition from other Scout organizations including the United States Boy Scouts and the Lone Scouts of America. The 1916 statute of incorporation established this institution among a small number of similarly chartered patriotic and national organizations, such as the Girl Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, the American Legion, the Red Cross, Little League Baseball, and the National Academy of Sciences. The federal incorporation was originally construed primarily as an honor; however, it does grant the chartered organization some special privileges and rights, including freedom from antitrust and monopoly regulation and complete control over the organization&#x27;s symbols and insignia, though it neither implies nor accords Congress any special control over the BSA, which remains free to function independently.

==Membership==

===Original programs===

Scouting America uses four primary programs to achieve its aims in Scouting:
* Cub Scouting is available to youth from kindergarten through fifth grade.
* Scouts BSA (formerly Boy Scouts) is the program of the BSA for youth ages 11 to 18; 10-year-olds can join after March 1 of their fifth grade year or if they have earned the Arrow of Light award.
* Venturing is the program for ages 14 to 21.
* Sea Scouting is the program for ages 14 to 21 focused on nautical activities.

There are about 100,000 physically or mentally disabled Scouts throughout the United States. Anyone certified as disabled &quot;may enroll in Scouting and remain in its program beyond the regulation age limits. This provision allows all members to advance in Scouting as far as they wish.&quot;

===Other programs===
Scouting America offers several other programs and subprograms beyond regular membership:
* The Order of the Arrow is the organization’s honor society for experienced campers, dedicated to the ideals of brotherhood and cheerful service. To be considered for membership one must live their life by the Scout Law, accomplish several requirements, and be elected by members of their unit.
* Lone Scouting is a program designed to allow those who would otherwise not be able to become Scouts or Cub Scouts—usually due to residence in an overseas/isolated community or unusual circumstances—to participate in the Scouting experience.
* STEM Scouts is a pilot program of Scouting America that focuses on STEM learning and career development for boys and girls in elementary, middle, and high school.
* Learning for Life is a school and work-site based program that is a subsidiary of Scouting America. It utilizes programs designed for schools and community-based organizations that are designed to prepare youth for the complexities of contemporary society and to enhance their self-confidence, motivation, and self-esteem. Exploring is the worksite-based program of Learning for Life with programs based on five areas of emphasis: career opportunities, life skills, citizenship, character education, and leadership experience. Learning for Life is not considered a regular Scouting program; it does not use the Scout Oath, Scout Law, uniforms, or insignia of regular Scouting. All Learning for Life programs are open to youth and adults without restriction based on gender, residence, sexual orientation, or other considerations other than age requirements.

===Membership controversies===

Unlike Learning for Life, membership in the regular Scouting America programs had been more restricted and controversial. Until the late 2010s, Cub Scouting or the program then-named Boy Scouting was open to boys only, but girls were permitted to join the Venturing, Sea Scouting, and Explorers programs in 1970. Women could also serve as adult volunteers in all programs in approximately the same time frame. On October 11, 2017, Scouting America announced that girls would be allowed to become Cub Scouts, starting in 2018, and be in the Scouts BSA program, starting on February 1, 2019.

Scouting America&#x27;s religious requirements of its members have been controversial and inconsistent. Many volunteers within the organization believe that atheists and agnostics are welcome, and because of this, in many troops they are. However, in 2018, the Boy Scouts of America National Executive Board &quot;reaffirm[ed] its unequivocal commitment to the Declaration of Religious Principle as a fundamental component of the mission of the Boy Scouts of America&quot;. At the same meeting, it also stated that &quot;[t]he recognition of God as the ruling and leading power in the universe and the grateful acknowledgement of His favors and blessings are necessary to the best type of citizenship and are wholesome precepts in the education of the growing members&quot;. This position is inconsistent with the fact that the BSA has had Buddhist troops since 1920, and Buddhism is a nontheistic religion which does not assert belief in a creator God. The BSA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Unitarian Universalist Association in 2016 which specifically gives ultimate authority over a participant&#x27;s spiritual welfare to the individual Unitarian Universalist congregation. The MOU also specifically includes within Unitarian Universalist chartered troops humanism as an acceptable form of spirituality as well as Earth-centered religions.

In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Boy Scouts of America v. Dale&quot; that Boy Scouts and all similar, private voluntary organizations have the constitutionally protected right under the First Amendment of freedom of association to set membership standards. In 2004, the BSA adopted a new policy statement, including a &quot;Youth Leadership&quot; policy that disallowed members to continue in leadership positions in the event they were to hold themselves out as &quot;open and avowed homosexuals.

At the Scouts annual meeting in April 2012, a leader from the Northeast presented a resolution that &quot;would allow individual units to accept gays as adult leaders&quot;. However, in July 2012, at the culmination of a review started in 2010, an 11-person committee convened by the BSA reached a &quot;unanimous consensus&quot; recommending retaining the current policy. Intel, UPS, and Merck cut financial ties with the BSA over the policy decision. Within the BSA National Executive Board, members James Turley, CEO of Ernst &amp; Young, and Randall Stephenson, CEO of AT&amp;T and who was then &quot;on track to become president of the Scout&#x27;s national board in 2014&quot; and later was, publicly opposed the policy and stated their intention &quot;to work from within the BSA Board to actively encourage dialogue and sustainable progress&quot; in changing the policy. On January 28, 2013, the BSA announced it was considering rescinding the ban on homosexuals, allowing chartered organizations to determine local policy.

On May 23, 2013, over 60% of the 1,400-member BSA National Council voted to remove the restriction denying membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation while emphasizing that any sexual conduct, whether heterosexual or homosexual, is not allowed. The resolution went into effect on January 1, 2014, but Scout leaders who were &quot;open and avowed homosexuals&quot; were still prohibited. The policy specifically states that BSA does not inquire into a person&#x27;s sexuality. Gay rights groups hailed the decision, but vowed to press on until all gay members were accepted. Some churches and conservative members threatened to quit the Boy Scouts in response. On June 12, 2013, the Southern Baptist Convention passed non-binding resolutions urging the BSA not to change their policy. In September 2013, a new scouting group called Trail Life USA was created, in support of what founders call &quot;traditional, Christian&quot; scouting. Subsequently, some Christian denomination congregations replaced their Boy Scouts of America troops with those of Trail Life USA.

In May 2015, Boy Scouts of America President Robert Gates said it was time to end the ban on gay leaders. Gates said it &quot;cannot be sustained&quot; any longer. On July 10, 2015, the Boy Scouts of America Executive Committee agreed, and referred the matter to the National Executive Board. On July 27, 2015, the Boy Scouts of America National Executive Board voted to lift the organization&#x27;s blanket ban on openly gay leaders and employees. Local chartering organizations are still permitted to set their own standards based on religious principle for selecting the adult volunteers for their unit.

On January 30, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America announced that transgender children who identify as boys would be allowed to enroll in boys-only programs, effective immediately. Previously, the sex listed on an applicant&#x27;s birth certificate determined eligibility for these programs; going forward, the decision would be based on the gender listed on the application. Joe Maldonado became the first openly transgender child identifying as a boy to join the Scouts on February 7, 2017. In 2016, he was rejected from the Boy Scouts for being transgender, but the policy was changed after his story became nationally known.

On October 11, 2017, the Boy Scouts of America announced that girls would be welcomed into Cub Scouts beginning in late 2018, with an early adopter program beginning on January 15, 2018, in councils that wished to participate early. The announcement included the statement that girls in Cub Scouting will simply be called &quot;Cub Scouts&quot;. The flagship program of Boy Scouts of America, previously known as &quot;Boy Scouting&quot;, became known as Scouts BSA on February 1, 2019, when the program opened to girls. Members of Scouts BSA are known as &quot;Scouts&quot;. On November 6, 2018, the GSUSA filed a federal trademark lawsuit seeking to block the BSA from rebranding itself simply as &quot;Scouts&quot;; this is not the first time the two organizations have legally contested the use of the term &quot;scout&quot;.

On May 7, 2024, BSA announced that it would change its name to Scouting America. The name change officially went into effect on February 8, 2025, the 115th anniversary of the organization. The Scout Oath, Law and program remain unchanged. The uniforms also remain the same but are embroidered with the new name. The change does not affect the name of their flagship &quot;program&quot;, &quot;Scouts BSA&quot; which was renamed from &quot;Boy Scouts&quot; in 2019.

===Aims, methods, and ideals===


The objectives of Scouting America are referred to as the Aims and Methods of Scouting: Character, Citizenship, Personal Fitness, Leadership. The BSA pursues these aims through an informal education system called the Scout method, with variations that are designed to be appropriate for the age and maturity of each membership division.

Cub Scouts wear a uniform that gives each Scout a level of identity within the den, the pack and the community. The Scouts learn teamwork by meeting and working together in a den of four to ten boys or girls under adult leadership. They learn and apply the ideals codified in the Scout Oath and the Scout Law through an advancement system using age-based ranks earned by completing required and elective adventures. Some advancement is done in the home and is intended to involve the entire family and many Cub Scout activities include family members.

In the Scouts BSA program, Scouts learn to use the ideals spelled out in the Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto (&quot;Be prepared&quot;), and the Scout slogan (&quot;Do a good turn daily&quot;). They wear a uniform and work together in patrols of four to ten Scouts with an elected patrol leader, who then appoints an assistant patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service.

Venturers are expected to know and live by the Scout Oath and Law. Before May 2014, members of the Venturing program followed the now discontinued Venturing Oath and Venturing Code. Venturers associate and work directly with adults advisors, but the crew is led by elected youth officers who are given opportunities to learn and apply leadership skills. Venturers plan and participate in interdependent group experiences dependent on cooperation. An emphasis on high adventure provides opportunities for team-building and practical leadership applications. A series of awards provide opportunities for recognition and personal growth. Each award requires the Venturer to teach what they have learned to others, thereby returning the skill and knowledge back to the community and enabling the Venturer to master those skills.

In October 2012, the National Council announced that, as a result of the findings and recommendations of a select committee made up of volunteer Scouters, the Cub Scout and Venturing programs would transition to use of the Scout Oath and Law, and in the case of the Venturers, the Boy Scout three-finger salute and sign as well. The Venturing change occurred in May 2014; and the Cub Scout change in mid-2015.

=== Ranks ===
There are seven ranks that a Scout in the Scouts BSA program may attain (note that Eagle Palms are not considered ranks). To obtain a rank, a Scout must complete the requirements for that rank, as well as have a Scoutmaster Conference and a Board of Review (with the exception of Scout Rank). To obtain a rank you must first acquire the rank previous to it, with the exception of Scout rank in which a Scout can earn at anytime once they have completed the requirements for it. The ranks are in the following order: Scout, Tenderfoot, Second Class, First Class, Star Scout, Life Scout, and Eagle Scout. An increasing number of merit badges, as well as being in troop leadership positions, is required for the latter 3 ranks, plus other requirements. Certain ranks require specific merit badges and leadership positions.

===Eagle Scout===

Eagle Scout is the highest rank one can receive in Scouts BSA. Since its introduction in 1911, the Eagle Scout rank has been earned by more than two million youth. Requirements include earning at least 21 merit badges and demonstrating Scout Spirit through the Scout Oath and Law, service, and leadership, all before or by age 18. This includes an extensive service project that the Scout plans, organizes, leads, and manages. Eagle Scouts are presented with a medal and a badge that visibly recognizes the accomplishments of the Scout. Additional recognition can be earned through Eagle Palms, awarded for completing additional tenure, leadership, and merit badge requirements.

Upon the introduction of girls into Scouts BSA in February 2019, a temporary time extension for Eagle rank was allowed for up to 2 years for all scouts who were older than 16 but not yet 18 years of age on February 1, 2019.

Of the 21 merit badges Eagle Scouts are required to earn, 14 of the badges must include: First Aid, Citizenship in the Community, Citizenship in the Nation, Citizenship in the World, Citizenship in Society, Communication, Cooking, Personal Fitness, Emergency Preparedness OR Lifesaving, Environmental Science OR Sustainability, Personal Management, Swimming OR Hiking OR Cycling, Camping, and Family Life.

===National Scout jamboree===
The National Scout Jamboree is a gathering of Scouts and Venturers from across the US. It is usually held every four years, with some adjustment for special years such as the 2010 National Scout Jamboree that celebrated the BSA centennial. The first jamboree was held in 1937 at the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. There were 27,232 Scouts and Leaders present at the first National Jamboree. In 1950, the Boy Scouts of America hosted their second National Jamboree at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. The event was to commemorate the organization&#x27;s 40th anniversary. Since then, jamborees have been held in varying locations. From 1981 until 2010, the jamboree was held at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. A permanent location owned by the BSA was sought in 2008 for future jamborees, high adventure programs and training. The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve near Beckley, West Virginia, is now the permanent site beginning with the 2013 National Scout Jamboree.

===High adventure===
The Boy Scouts of America operates several high-adventure bases at the national level. Each offers a wide range of programs and training; a typical core program may include sailing, wilderness canoeing or wilderness backpacking and camping trips. These bases are administered by the High Adventure Division of the National Council.

Current high-adventure bases of the Boy Scouts of America include Philmont Scout Ranch, Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases, Florida National High Adventure Sea Base, and The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve.

===Training===
The BSA offers a wide variety of mandatory and optional training programs in youth protection, outdoor skills and leadership.

====Adult leader training====
Every adult leader must complete Youth Protection Training, and then is strongly encouraged to complete a general overview training called &quot;This is Scouting&quot;, and a &quot;Fast Start&quot; training specific to his/her program level. Position-specific training is required for all direct-contact leaders. Upon completion of basic training, a leader may wear the Trained emblem on his/her BSA uniform.

Supplemental skill-specific training is also available to BSA volunteers to gain knowledge in outdoors skills including camping, hiking, first aid, Leave No Trace, swim safety, climbing safety, hazardous weather, and other skills.

The highest level of BSA training is Wood Badge, focused on helping participants develop leadership skills while participating in an outdoor program over five days. Some councils offer high-adventure training for adults using the Powder Horn program. Leaders can also take the Seabadge advanced leadership and management course.

====Youth leadership training====
Scout youth leaders may attend the unit-level Introduction to Leadership Skills for Troops. Local councils offer the advanced National Youth Leadership Training and the National Council offers the National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience conducted at Philmont Training Center. The Boy Scouts of America also offers the NYLT Leadership Academy which trains youth staff members from across the country for council-level NYLT courses.

Venturers and Sea Scouts may attend the unit-level Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews or Introduction to Leadership Skills for Ships. Crew officers can attend Crew Officer Orientation, and then a council-provided Kodiak leadership training program

Order of the Arrow members may attend the National Leadership Seminar, run multiple times each year by each region.

====National Camping School====
The Boy Scouts of America operates a National Camping School program which trains people how to run various departments or areas at the Scouts BSA summer camps. Some online training is offered, but most areas require an in-person week-long training program at one of the National Camping Schools. After successfully completing a week-long program, a person is entitled to wear the National Camping School patch. The regular-size patch may be worn on the right breast shirt pocket, in the temporary patch spot. National Camping School certification is valid for five years.

==== COPE ====
COPE, which stands for Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience, is a program that consists of a series of tests of strength, agility, coordination, and problem-solving, individually and within groups.

===Outdoor program===
Scouts see nature as an adventurous place, and it is expected that when they get older the experience from their youth will make them nature lovers. Scouts envisage nature as a heritage. 
==Organization==

===National Council===

The National Council is the corporate membership of the Boy Scouts of America and consists of volunteer Scouters who meet annually. The day-to-day operations of the National Council are administered by the Chief Scout Executive and other national professional staff. National Council members include volunteers who are elected national officers and executive board members, regional presidents, the local council representatives, members at large, and honorary members. The national headquarters has been in Irving, Texas since 1979.

Since the founding of the BSA in 1910, the President of the United States has served as the organization&#x27;s honorary chair during his term in office, former presidents serve as honorary vice chairs for their lifetimes.

===Governance and the National Executive Board===

The BSA National Executive Board governs the organization. The 2015 National Executive Board consisted of 79 members.

The board is led by the national president, a volunteer elected by the National Council. Board members included regular elected members, regional presidents, and up to five appointed youth members. The Chief Scout Executive is the board secretary and non-voting member. The National Executive Board has a number of standing committees that correspond to the professional staff organization of the National Council.

Present and past members of the National Executive Board include Utah Senator Mitt Romney, Ernst &amp; Young CEO Jim Turley and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson. Other members included Latter-day Saint Church President Thomas S. Monson.

===Groups and divisions===
The Program Impact Division is responsible for developing the Scouting program and includes the volunteer committees and staff working on volunteer training, youth development, and other program impact needs. The All Markets membership emphasis includes focus groups and special committees working to improve outreach to youth and families in various underserved ethnic populations, with literature and marketing materials targeting Hispanic/Latino families, Asian-American families, and African-American families. The BSA also participates in the American Indian Scouting Association in partnership with the Girl Scouts.

The Outdoor Adventure Division oversees four high adventure bases: Northern Tier (Minnesota, Manitoba, and Ontario), Philmont Scout Ranch (New Mexico), Sea Base (Florida, US Virgin Islands, and Bahamas), and Summit Bechtel Reserve (West Virginia), over one hundred separate camps and reservations specifically dedicated to scouts, and other special programs such as the Order of the Arrow.

Other divisions provides support for the world and national jamborees and International Scouting relations. The Membership Impact Division works to sustain marketing efforts and relationships with the national organizations that make up the predominant number of chartered organizations, such as Lions International, Rotary International, Kiwanis International, American Legion, Elks, VFW, and all religious denominations chartering BSA units.

The National Supply Group is responsible for developing and selling uniforms, apparel, insignia, literature, and equipment. It sells equipment and supplies through National Scout Shops, local council trading posts, authorized independent resellers, and online at ScoutShop.org. Supply Group also licenses trademarks for use by other commercial vendors. The Administrative Group provides internal administration service and support. It includes the Marketing and Communications Division responsible for marketing the BSA program, administering the national websites, and publishing &quot;Scouting&quot; for adult leaders and &quot;Scout Life&quot; (formerly &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;) for youth.

The National Scouting Museum is located at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico. Exhibits include high adventure sections, hands-on learning experiences, interactive exhibits, and a historical collection tracing uniforms, themes, and documents from the beginning of the Scouting movement in America. Among the museum&#x27;s artifacts are the Eagle Scout medal of Arthur Rose Eldred, the first Eagle Scout.

The National Court of Honor certifies the BSA&#x27;s highest awards: lifesaving and meritorious action awards, distinguished service awards, Eagle Scout and the Quartermaster Award.

===National Service Territories===

For administrative purposes, the BSA is divided into sixteen National Service Territories (NSTs) including international areas for scouts with parents serving outside the US. Each NST encompasses multiple states or portions of states/counties.

Until 2021, the Boy Scouts of America was divided into four regions for administrative purposes — Central, Southern, Western, Northeast.

===Local councils===


The BSA program is administered through local councils, with each council covering a geopolitical area that may vary from a single city to an entire state. Councils receive an annual charter from the National Council and are usually incorporated as a charitable organization.

The council level organization is similar to that of the National Council. The council executive board is headed by the council president and is made up of annually elected local community leaders. The board establishes the council program and carries out the resolutions, policies, and activities of the council. Board members serve without pay and some are volunteer Scouters working at the unit level. Youth members may be elected to the council executive board according to the council by-laws.

The Scout executive manages council operations—including finance, property management, advancement and awards, registrations, and Scout Shop sales—with a staff of other professionals and para-professionals. Volunteer commissioners lead the unit service functions of the council, help maintain the standards of the BSA, and assure a healthy unit program.

The BSA charters two councils for American Scouts living overseas, largely on military bases in Europe and Asia. The Transatlantic Council, headquartered in Livorno, Italy, serves BSA units in much of Europe, and the Far East Council, headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas. The Direct Service branch makes the Scouting movement available to US citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas. The Aloha Council in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and in the sovereign countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.

The Greater New York Councils are unique in that they are divided into five boroughs with each led by a borough Scout executive and each borough then divided into districts.

Councils are divided into districts with leadership provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the district commissioner. Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman. Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and do not have a separate corporate status.

===Chartered organizations and units===
The Boy Scouts of America partners with community organizations, such as religious congregations, fraternal groups, service clubs, and other community associations, to provide the Scouting program for the particular neighborhood or community in which the particular organization wishes to reach out to youth and families. The connection with religious congregations stems back to at least 1910, when a Catholic parish church in Saint Paul, Minnesota chartered the first troop in the city.

Organizations hold charters issued by the BSA and are known then as chartered organizations. Each chartered organization provides the meeting place for BSA youth, oversees the volunteer leaders, and agrees to follow the basic BSA safety policies and values-based program, and the organization is considered the &quot;owner&quot; of its local program, much like a franchise.

Within each chartered organization, there may be one or more &quot;units&quot;. A unit is a group of youth and adults which are collectively designated as a Cub Scout pack, Scouts BSA troop, Venturing crew, or Sea Scout ship. Each chartered organization may charter as many units as it wishes, but usually only 3 or 4 (one unit for each program level). The BSA council provides the leader training, inter-unit activities, camping programs, volunteer and professional support, and insurance coverage. Units also create their own activities (such as monthly camping trips, outings, or service projects), and most meet weekly at the place of the chartered organization for youth to learn basic skill development and practice leadership in small groups known as dens and patrols.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the first partner to sponsor Scouting in the United States. It adopted the program in 1913 as part of its Mutual Improvement Association program for young men, and it was the largest single sponsor of Scouting until it ceased sponsoring Scouting units at the end of 2019.

The BSA at its peak reportedly had 4.8 million members in the 1970s with its membership plunging to less than half across its 266 local councils; down from 2.9 million in 2006 to roughly 2.3 million youth members just over a decade later.

===Leadership===

In all Scouting units above the Cub Scout pack (i.e. units serving adolescent Scouts), leadership of the unit comprises both adult leaders (Scouters) and youth leaders (Scouts). In fact, this is a critical component of the program. In order to learn leadership, the youth must actually serve in leadership roles. Adult leaders may be either men or women in all positions.

A properly run Scouts BSA troop is run by the Senior Patrol Leader, who is elected by the troop, and their assistant, who may either be elected or appointed. These and the other youth leaders are advised and supported by the adult leaders. &quot;Scouts are youth-led.&quot;

===Finance===
The National Council is incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and is funded from private donations, membership dues, corporate sponsors, and special events with total revenues of $237 million.

In addition to donations from individuals, the BSA receives extensive donations from major corporations. In 2010, their top corporate donors were, in order, Intel, Emerson, Verizon, 3M, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Pfizer, Valero, UPS, U.S. Bank, Eli Lilly, GE, and Monsanto.

==Impact on American life==
Scouting and Boy Scouts are well known throughout American culture and approximately 110 million Americans have participated in BSA programs at some time in their lives. The term &quot;Boy Scout&quot; is used to generally describe someone who is earnest and honest, or who helps others cheerfully; it can also be used as a pejorative term for someone deemed to be overly idealistic.

Prominent Americans in diverse walks of life, from filmmaker Steven Spielberg (who helped launch a merit badge in cinematography) to adventurer Steve Fossett to U.S. presidents, were BSA members as youths. Over two-thirds of all astronauts have had some type of involvement in Scouting, and eleven of the twelve men to walk on the Moon were Scouts, including Eagle Scouts Neil Armstrong and Charlie Duke. The pinewood derby—a wood car racing event for Cub Scouts—has been declared &quot;a celebrated rite of spring&quot; and was named part of &quot;America&#x27;s 100 Best&quot; by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

President Gerald Ford said, &quot;I can say without hesitation, because of Scouting principles, I know I was a better athlete, I was a better naval officer, I was a better congressman, and I was a better prepared President.&quot;

Famed American illustrator Norman Rockwell&#x27;s works were closely associated with the Boy Scouts of America for much of the 20th century. Beginning in 1913, Rockwell began illustrating covers of &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, the magazine for BSA youth. He also drew the organization&#x27;s annual calendar illustrations between 1925 and 1976.

In 1969, as a tribute to Rockwell&#x27;s 75th birthday, officials of and the Boy Scouts of America asked Rockwell to pose in &quot;Beyond the Easel&quot; for a calendar illustration. As part of the US Bicentennial celebrations in 1976, Rockwell&#x27;s Scouting paintings toured the nation and were viewed by 280,000 people. In 2008, a twelve-city US tour of Rockwell&#x27;s works was scheduled.

Alvin Townley wrote in &quot;Legacy of Honor&quot; about the large positive impact of Eagle Scouts in America. Townley cited such examples as how Scouts, especially Eagle Scouts, were disproportionately represented among Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s volunteer relief workers; just as they are disproportionately represented among members of the United States Senate. Former Governor Rick Perry of Texas is an Eagle Scout who defended BSA policies and restrictions against ACLU criticisms in his book, &quot;On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For&quot;.

Mark Mays, CEO of Clear Channel Communications, told a magazine interviewer in May 2008 that, &quot;Particularly in the very impactful ages of youth 11 to 14 years old, when they can really go astray and you&#x27;re taking the time to spend with them and focus on cultural core values like reverent, trustworthy, loyal, and helpful—all of those different things ... Scouting has a huge positive impact on boys and their lives, and that in turn positively impacts our communities and society as a whole.&quot;

Mayor of New York City and business tycoon Michael Bloomberg, said that the BSA&#x27;s Scout Law required of all Boy Scouts—a Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent—are &quot;all the American values ... Americans have quaintly simplistic ways and direct ways of phrasing things ... I think it&#x27;s one of the great strengths of this country.&quot;

Peter Applebome, an editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote in 2003 of his experience as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, &quot;I feel lucky to have had this unexpected vehicle to share my son&#x27;s youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well.&quot; He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, &quot;Scouting&#x27;s core values ... are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life. Scouting&#x27;s genuinely egalitarian goals and instincts are more important now than they&#x27;ve ever been. It&#x27;s one of the only things that kids do that&#x27;s genuinely cooperative, not competitive.&quot;

At the turn of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of vandalism, with destruction of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.

The Boy Scouts of America are quite particular about how and when the Scout uniforms and insignia may be used in film and other portrayals; and for that reason, most films and television productions made in the US utilize &quot;ersatz&quot; Scouting organizations. Examples of this include the &quot;Order of the Straight Arrow&quot;, portrayed in the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; cartoon series, and the &quot;Indian Guides&quot; depicted in the 1995 Chevy Chase film, &quot;Man of the House&quot;. One exception to this policy is the Walt Disney movie &quot;Follow Me, Boys!&quot; with Fred MacMurray portraying a Scoutmaster of a rural troop. It was released to theaters in 1966 and re-released in 1976. Another is the final scene of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; television show, where Tony Soprano sits down to dinner in a restaurant. At another table, several Cub Scouts, in full uniform, are seated.

===Good Turns===

From the inception of the Scouting movement, Scouts have been urged to &quot;Do a Good Turn Daily&quot;, as it is the slogan for the Boy Scouts of America. The first national Good Turn was the promotion of a safe and sane Fourth of July in 1912. During World War I, &quot;Every Scout to Save a Soldier&quot; was a slogan used to motivate children involved in Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to help sell War savings stamps. Scouting for Food is an ongoing annual program begun in 1986 that collects food for local food banks.

In 1997, the BSA developed Service to America with a commitment to provide 200 million hours of service by youth members by the end of the year 2000. As part of Service to America, the BSA provided service projects in conjunction with the National Park Service. In October 2003, the Department of the Interior expanded the program with the creation of Take Pride in America, opening service to all Americans. Service to America became Good Turn for America in 2004 and expanded to address the problems of hunger, homelessness, and inadequate housing and poor health in conjunction with the Salvation Army, the American Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity, and other organizations.

==Controversies==
On February 1, 2019, the Boy Scouts of America renamed its flagship program, Boy Scouts, to Scouts BSA to reflect its policy change allowing girls to join separate, gender-specific troops. On February 18, 2020, the National BSA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and is currently restructuring its financial situation. On November 16, 2020, the National BSA disclosed in their bankruptcy filings that over 92,000 former Scouts had reported sexual abuse by members of the organization. In December 2021, the insurer for the Boy Scouts of America agreed to pay $800 million into the fund for survivors. In 2022, the Boy Scouts of America agreed to pay an additional $2.4 billion into the fund as part of a bankruptcy settlement with payments beginning in September 2023.

===Sexual abuse cases===
Scouting sexual-abuse cases are situations where youth involved in Scouting programs have been sexually abused by someone who is also involved in the Scouting program. J.L. Tarr, a US Chief Scout Executive in the 1980s, was quoted in an article regarding sexual assault cases against Scout leaders across all 50 states: &quot;That&#x27;s been an issue since the Boy Scouts began.&quot; Several reports have surfaced over the years regarding incidents of sexual abuse within the Boy Scouts of America to include incidents of repeat offenders. There have also been several high-profile court cases that resulted in convictions and settlements involving such incidents. On October 19, 2012, the Boy Scouts of America were forced by court order to release over 20,000 pages of documentation on 1200 alleged child sexual abuse cases within the organization from between 1965 and 1985. Legal claims against BSA for such matters continue to the present day. Following its bankruptcy in February 2020, over 92,000 sexual abuse claims were filed with the bankruptcy court before the November 16, 2020 deadline to receive claims.

In the 1980s BSA developed its Youth Protection program, to educate youth, leaders and parents about the problem, and to introduce barriers to sexual abuse of children using the Scout program to reach victims. &quot;Two deep&quot; leadership dictates that no adult member can be alone with any youth member (other than their own child). Shortly after joining, youth must discuss with their parents a pamphlet on sexual abuse. Prior to joining, adults must take a youth protection training course, which must be renewed every two years. Since 2003, new adult members must pass a criminal background check (adults who were already members had to pass a background check by 2008). The Youth Protection Plan from the organization is linked to in a CDC report on such programs.

===Financial problems===
In recent decades, membership in the BSA and income have declined.

In addition, the organization spent millions of dollars to contest and settle lawsuits arising from sexual misconduct by BSA volunteers and employees dating back to the 1960s. From 2015 to 2017, it paid nearly $12 million to the law firm Ogletree Deakins for litigation counsel. In its 2018 annual report, BSA officials said that the organization&#x27;s future financial situation would depend on the outcome of various litigation and its costs. The annual report said that the BSA may have &quot;to pay damages out of its own funds to the extent the claims are not covered by insurance or if the insurance carriers are unable or unwilling to honor the claims.&quot;

Accordingly, the BSA hired a law firm in December 2018 to investigate filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Such a bankruptcy could stop litigation of at least 140 lawsuits and prevent further lawsuits. In October 2019, the BSA raised membership rates to cover its increased operational expenses, particularly insurance costs.

On February 18, 2020, the organization filed for bankruptcy in the Bankruptcy court of the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, listing liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million and assets of $1 billion to $10 billion. The bankruptcy filing came as the organization faced hundreds of sexual abuse lawsuits. As a result of the filing, all civil litigation against the organization was suspended. Local Councils and units remained largely unaffected as they are standalone units. BSA contends that it alone should be financially responsible for any settlements in the sex abuse case lawsuits. Plaintiffs have complained that BSA is hiding its assets through its affiliates. Critics of the filing derisively described the organization and its move as &quot;bankrupt, but not because it&#x27;s broke.&quot;

===Anti-bullying movement===
Due to reports surfacing in the 1970s and 1980s regarding a high level of bullying in the Boy Scouts, efforts were made to develop a no-tolerance bully policy within the Boy Scouts of America. In the 1990s, the Boy Scouts acknowledged that the organization had a problem with bullying, in particular due to a &quot;boys will be boys&quot; attitude within Scouting before the 1970s, when adult leaders tended to overlook younger or weaker Scouts who were &quot;picked on&quot; by older boys, such adult leaders feeling that bullying &quot;toughened someone up&quot;, labeling boys as &quot;snitches&quot; and &quot;tattletales&quot; should bullying be reported to the adult leadership.

One of the more widely published accounts of Boy Scout bullying occurred in July 1987 when a Boy Scout at the Goshen Scout Reservation was severely beaten in his sleep by several other Scouts. The incident resulted in the Goshen staff changing the layout of its campsites, to prevent having sites in extremely isolated areas, as well as assigning camp staff members to each visiting troop as &quot;advisors&quot; and also to watch for fights or other trouble resulting from conflicts developing at the various campsites.

In the 21st century, the Boy Scouts have adopted a &quot;Bullying Awareness Program&quot; which trains adults to recognize the signs of bullying, especially in isolated environments such as extended campouts in the wilderness or at summer camp. Parents are also advised on what to do, and whom to contact, should a Scout state they are being bullied by other Scouts. Dealing with the bullies themselves is also addressed, in particular those bullies who &quot;game the system&quot;, pretending to be compassionate and apologetic to bully victims when adults confront them, only to return to such behaviors when the adults are no longer present.

===LDS departure===
In 2018, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsthe largest charter organization supporting BSAcut ties with the BSA, substantially contributing to a net loss of nearly a million scouts and leaders. The decision was made partly in response to BSA membership policy changes, such as allowing girls, openly gay, and transgender people to participate in the organization. However, a joint statement released by the First Presidency of the LDS Church on 8 May, 2018, reflects the LDS Church&#x27;s official stance on the departure, and states, in the last paragraph &quot;While the Church will no longer be a chartered partner of BSA or sponsor Scouting units after December 31, 2019, it continues to support the goals and values reflected in the Scout Oath and Scout Law and expresses its profound desire for Scouting’s continuing and growing success in the years ahead.&quot; 

==Commemorations==



===115th Anniversary===
During the weekend of February 8th, 2025, the organization’s 115th anniversary, sites across the U.S. were illuminated in red, white and blue, including Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building, and the Pennsylvania State Capitol.

<text>USS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; (SSBN-599), named after the American Revolutionary War figure and Founding Father Patrick Henry (1736–1799), was a nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarine of the United States Navy. She was later converted into an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-599.

==History==
===Commissioned===
&quot;Patrick Henry&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation, in Groton, Connecticut, on 26 May 1958. She was launched on 22 September 1959, sponsored by Mrs. Betty Arends (née Tychon), wife of Congressman Leslie C. Arends and was commissioned on 9 April 1960, with Commander Harold E. Shear in command of the Blue crew and Commander Robert L. J. Long commanding the Gold crew.

Manned alternately by two crews, Blue and Gold, like all US Navy ballistic missile submarines, to maximize her submerged operations, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; underwent shakedown with the Blue crew until 16 September 1960, when the Gold crew took over. The second fleet ballistic missile (FBM) submarine, she commenced her first deterrent patrol in December 1960 with her Blue Crew on board. When she surfaced off Holy Loch, Scotland, on 8 March 1961, she had set a record for her type, cruising submerged 66 days and 22 hours. &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; was the first ballistic missile submarine to enter Holy Loch, and the first to go alongside the submarine tender for replenishment and routine repair.

&quot;Patrick Henry&quot; conducted 17 deterrent patrols from Holy Loch until December 1964 when she returned to Electric Boat. For 18 months she received complete and extensive overhaul and repair operations, including refueling of the S5W reactor plant and modifications to permit the handling of the Polaris A-3 missiles. After shakedown in mid-1966 off Puerto Rico and Cape Canaveral, Florida, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; departed Charleston, South Carolina, in December for her eighteenth patrol, equipped with A-3 Polaris missiles and assigned to Submarine Squadron 14. On 1 March 1968, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; completed her 22nd patrol at Holy Loch.

During the early 1970s, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot;″s home port was Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

In 1976, &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; moved to Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, for refueling.

===Demonstration and shakedown operations, 1978===
In the spring of 1978, the &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; underwent Demonstration and Shakedown Operations (DASO). The purpose of the DASO was to ensure that the submarine&#x27;s crew could safely meet the stringent requirements for handling, maintaining and operating her strategic weapons system. It also confirmed that the submarine&#x27;s crew was able to target and launch her submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM) correctly and certified that the crew and submarine were ready for operational patrol. Additionally, system performance data was collected about the weapons system and submarine while in an operational environment, which evaluates the readiness and performance of the weapon system.

After transiting the Panama Canal, the Blue Crew successfully fired an A-3 Polaris missile off the coast of Cape Kennedy in July 1978, and the Gold Crew completed a successful missile firing several weeks later. The Gold Crew brought the &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; back through the Panama Canal and transited to Pearl Harbor. She remained with the Pacific Fleet into the 1980s.

===Conversion to attack submarine, 1982===
In 1982 &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; and many of her sister ships had their ballistic missile tubes disabled and were reclassified as attack submarines (SSNs). &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; was redesignated SSN-599.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Patrick Henry&quot; was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 May 1984, and as of 21 August 1997, she was disposed of through the Ship-Submarine recycling program at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

<text>Norman Cross Prison in Huntingdonshire, England, was the world&#x27;s first purpose-built prisoner-of-war camp or &quot;depot&quot;. Constructed in 1796–97, it was designed to hold prisoners of war from France and its allies during the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars. By 1816, it had been largely demolished.

Norman Cross, now in Cambridgeshire, lies south of Peterborough, between the villages of Folksworth, Stilton, and Yaxley. The junction of the A1 and A15 roads is here. Traditionally in Huntingdonshire, Norman Cross gave its name to one of the hundreds of Huntingdonshire and, from 1894 to 1974, to Norman Cross Rural District.

==Design and construction of prison camp==

The Royal Navy Transport Board was responsible for the care of prisoners of war. When Sir Ralph Abercromby communicated in 1796 that he was transferring 4,000 prisoners from the West Indies, the Board began the search for a site for a new prison. The site was chosen because it was on the Great North Road only north of London and was deemed far enough from the coast that escaped prisoners could not easily flee back to France. The site had a good water supply and close to sufficient local sources of food to sustain many thousands of prisoners and the guards. Work commenced in December 1796 with much of the timber building prefabricated in London and assembled on site. 500 carpenters and labourers worked on the site for three months. The cost of construction was £34,581 11s 3d.

The design of the prison was based on that of a contemporary artillery fort. A ditch wide and about 5 feet deep (to prevent prisoners tunnelling out) was placed inside the wall (originally a wooden stockade fence, replaced with a brick wall in 1805) and guarded by &#x27;silent sentries&#x27; who could not be seen by the prisoners. In 1797, &quot;The prisoners constantly sawed the inner palings [of the stockade] close to the ground, so they could be removed and replaced at night without fear of detection. In this manner they often got through the inner palings, but in crossing to the outer were always recaptured.&quot; The barracks for the garrison were placed outside and a large guard house (known as the Block House) containing troops and six cannon was placed right at the centre. The interior of the prison was divided into four quadrangles, each with four double-storey wooden accommodation blocks for 500 prisoners and four ablution blocks. One accommodation block was reserved for officers. Half of each quadrangle was a large exercise yard. The north-east quadrangle contained the prison hospital. There was also a windowless block known as the Black Hole in which prisoners were kept shackled on half rations as punishment, mainly for violence towards the guards although two prisoners were sent to the Black Hole for &quot;infamous vices&quot;. 30 wells were sunk to draw drinking water for the prisoners and garrison.

==Operation==

The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number of prisoners recorded in any official document was 3,300 in October 1804 and the highest was 6,272 on 10 April 1810.

Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. Sir Rupert George was responsible for the &quot;care and custody&quot; of the French prisoners.

Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of privateers. About 100 senior officers and some civilians &quot;of good social standing&quot;, mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given &quot;parole d&#x27;honneur&quot; outside the prison, mainly in Peterborough, although some as far away as Northampton, Plymouth, Melrose, and Abergavenny. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society. Some &quot;with good private means&quot; hired servants and often dined out while wearing full uniform. Three French officers died of natural causes while on parole and were buried with full military honours. Four French officers and five Dutch officers married English women while on parole. The most senior officer on parole from the prison was General Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes who resided with his wife in Cheltenham from 1809 until they escaped back to France in 1811. General (1762–1816), Adjutant Commandant was confined here for breaking parole; he was allowed further parole and after again attempting to escape was sent to Chatham.

Among the prisoners in 1797 were Germans who had been conscripted into the French army. These were encouraged to enlist in the 60th Foot, which was raising a rifle-armed 5th Battalion in imitation of German &quot;jägers&quot;.

===Clothing===
The French prisoners, whose main pastime was gambling, were accused by the British government of selling their clothes and few personal possessions to raise money for further gambling. In 1801, the British government issued statements blaming the French Consul for not supplying sufficient clothing (the British government had paid the French for all English prisoners held in France and French colonies to be clothed). In July 1801 Jeremiah Askew, a tradesman at Yaxley, was convicted of being in possession of palliasses and other articles bearing the government mark of the &#x27;broad arrow&#x27;. He was sentenced to stand in the pillory at Norman Cross and two years of hard labour.

Samuel Johnson and a Mr Serle, who visited the barracks, compiled a report on behalf of the British government, stating that the proportion of food allowance was fully sufficient to maintain both life and health, but added: &quot;provided it is not shamefully lost by gambling&quot;. The Lords of the Admiralty, along with Johnson, instructed that naked prisoners should be clothed at once, without waiting for the French supply or payment for clothing.

The British government provided each naked prisoner with a yellow suit, a grey or yellow cap, a yellow jacket, a red waistcoat, yellow trousers, a neckerchief, two shirts, two pairs of stockings, and one pair of shoes. The bright colours were chosen to aid the recognition of escaped prisoners. In Foulley&#x27;s model of the prison (at the Musée de l&#x27;Armée, Paris; pictured above) more than half the prisoners are represented wearing these clothes.

===Food===
Food was prepared by cooks drawn from the prison ranks. The cooks, one for every 12 prisoners, were paid a small allowance by the British government. The initial daily food ration for each prisoner was 1 lb of beef, 1 lb of bread, 1 lb of potatoes, and 1 lb of cabbage or pease. As the majority of prisoners were Roman Catholic, herrings or cod was substituted for beef on Fridays. Each prisoner was also allowed 2 oz of soap per week. In November 1797, the British and French governments agreed that each should feed their own citizens in their enemy&#x27;s prisons. The French provided a daily ration of one pint of beer, 8 oz of beef or fish, 26 oz of bread, 2 oz of cheese and 1 lb of potato or fresh vegetables. They were also allowed 1 lb of soap and 1 lb of tobacco per month. Patients in the prison hospital were given a daily ration of one pint of tea morning and evening, 16 oz of bread, 16 oz of beef, mutton or fish, one pint of broth, 16 oz of green vegetables or potato, and two pints of beer.

The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality.

Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations.

===Education===
Most prisoners were illiterate and were offered the opportunity to learn to read and write in their native language and English. Prisoners who could read were given access to books. News on the progress of the war, including successes and defeats on both sides, was reported to prisoners.

In April 1799, French prisoners at Liverpool were reported to have performed plays by Voltaire in a neat prison theatre they had constructed. In July 1799, Dutch prisoners at Norman Cross sought permission to use one building as a theatre. The Sea Lords refused. However, Foulley&#x27;s model, depicting the prison as it was in about 1809, shows a theatre in the south-west quadrangle.

===Religion===
There was no prison chapel but a Catholic priest resided in the garrison barracks. From 1808, the former Bishop of Moulins Étienne-Jean-Baptiste-Louis des Gallois de La Tour, who lived in exile at Stilton, was permitted by the Admiralty to minister and provide charity to the prisoners at his own expense. He later became Archbishop of Bourges.

===Health===
Sick prisoners were initially treated in the prison hospital by two French Navy surgeons and 24 orderlies.

As the number of prisoners increased, disease spread throughout the camp and 1,020 prisoners died in a typhus outbreak in 1800–1801. A special &#x27;typhus cemetery&#x27; was dug near the camp.

Leonard Gillespie, Surgeon to the Fleet, wrote in 1804 that pneumonia was common with some cases becoming fatal carditis. There were also many cases of consumption. A brick house for a resident British surgeon was built adjacent to the prison hospital in 1805.

A peculiar outbreak of nyctalopia or night-blindness affected many of the prisoners in 1806. They became severely dyspeptic and completely blind from sunset until dawn, to the extent that their fitter companions had to lead them around the camp. Various treatments were tried and failed; finally they were cured with black hellebore, given as snuff, which relieved the dyspepsia and restored their night vision within a few days.

A total of 1,770 prisoner deaths were recorded, the majority from disease, during the time the prison was in operation, although the records are incomplete.

==Craft and prison economy==

At the outbreak of the war, the Transport Board wrote that &quot;the prisoners in all the depots in the country are at full liberty to exercise their industry within the prisons, in manufacturing and selling any articles they may think proper excepting those which would affect the Revenue in opposition to the Laws, obscene toys and drawings, or articles made either from their clothing or the prison stores&quot;.
Many prisoners at Norman Cross made artefacts such as toys, model ships and dominoes sets from carved wood or animal bone, and straw marquetry. Examples of the prisoners&#x27; craftwork were sold to visitors and passersby. Some highly skilled prisoners were commissioned by wealthy individuals, some of the prisoners becoming very rich in the process. Archdeacon William Strong, a regular visitor to the prison, notes in his diary of 23 October 1801 that he provided a piece of mahogany and paid a prisoner £1 15s 6d to build a model of the Block House and £2 2s for a straw picture of Peterborough Cathedral.

Prisoners were permitted to sell artefacts twice a week at the local market, or daily at the prison gate. Prices were regulated so the prisoners did not undersell local industries. In return, prisoners were permitted to buy additional food, tobacco, wine, clothes or materials for further work. In 1813 ten inmates on behalf of the prisoners were allowed to attend the sale of articles, a long tent was erected in the barrack-yard, where these were exhibited to the visitors, who had purchased articles through the summer, to the amount of £50 to £60 a week.

At the end of the war, the Transport Board noted that some prisoners had earned as much as 100 guineas. An advertisement in 1814 demonstrated that some items were made collectively and others by a solo craftsman.

Thousands of Norman Cross artefacts survive today in local museums, including 800 in Peterborough Museum, and private collections. A collection of model ships made at Norman Cross is on display at Arlington Court in Devon.

During December 1804, prisoners Nicholas Deschamps and Jean Roubillard were discovered forging £1 bank notes. Engraved plates of a very high standard and printing implements were found. The former was convicted of forgery and the latter of uttering at the Huntingdon Assizes in 1805. Francois Raize gave evidence for the crown. Forging banknotes was a capital offence at the time. They were sentenced to death but this was commuted. They remained in Huntingdon Gaol until they received a free pardon from the Prince Regent and were moved to Norman Cross and repatriated with the prisoners of war to France in 1814.

Prisoners at the Norman Cross site were not permitted to manufacture straw hats or bonnets (presumably so as not to impinge upon the local industry). The authorities appear to have enforced this stipulation: at Huntingdon Assizes in May 1811 John Lun, snr (twelve months) and three sons (six months) were sentenced to prison for a conspiracy, in endeavouring to persuade the NCOs and privates of the garrison to permit a quantity of straw to be conveyed into the site for the purpose of making straw hats. In September 1812 the North York Militia held a regimental court-martial lasting three days that reduced four sergeants to the ranks and reprimanded two others for conniving at the guards smuggling raw straw into the prison and the plaited product out.

==Insubordination and escapes==

Insubordination was rife among prisoners. A force of Shropshire Militia, a battalion of army reserve, and a volunteer force from Peterborough were required to restrain the prisoners from breaking out during a particular period of defiance. As a boy, the author George Borrow lived at the camp from July 1811 to April 1813 with his father Lieutenant Thomas Borrow of the West Norfolk Militia; he described the place in &quot;Lavengro&quot;.

Six prisoners escaped in April 1801. Three of them were caught at Boston, Lincolnshire, and the remaining three were caught in a fishing boat off the Norfolk coast. In the hat of one was found a complete map of the Lincolnshire coast. Each year the number of attempts to escape increased, as did the numbers in each escape. Three groups of 16 men each escaped in late 1801. Incomplete tunnels were discovered in 1802.

In October 1804 the press reported the prisoners created a disturbance with the intention of breaking the perimeter fencing. Assistance was sent for from Peterborough. A troop of Yeomanry galloped to support, later followed by two more troops and an infantry unit. The prisoners had cut down a part of the wood enclosure during the night, nine of them effected their escape through the aperture. At daybreak, it was discovered in another part of the prison that prisoners had undermined a distance of 34 feet towards the great South road under the fosse which surrounded the prison, although the fosse was four feet deep, and no tools were discovered with them. Five escapees were taken.

During the night, several prisoners escaped in February 1807.
Three escapees were retaken near Ryde heading for Southampton in April 1807.
The agent at the depot (camp commander), Captain Pressland RN, was inviting tenders for the building of a wall, in August 1807. This may have become known to the prisoners as a major escape attempt was made.

After the second of these two major escape attempts in 1804 and 1807, the wooden stockade fence was soon replaced with a brick wall.

One prisoner, Charles Francois Marie Bourchier, stabbed a civilian, Alexander Halliday, while attempting to escape on 9 September 1808. He was convicted at the Huntingdon Assizes and sentenced to death by hanging. He was taken from Huntingdon Gaol on Friday 16th and executed at Norman Cross in front of the prisoners and the whole garrison. This was the only civil execution at Norman Cross. After the stabbing, the guards, having seen two or three other knives, searched the entire prison and 700 daggers were found.

On 24 September 1808, an English sloop of 44 tons called the &quot;Margaret Anne&quot; (William Tempel, master, of Barton) arrived at Calais, laden with 18 tons of coals. She was seized in the night of the 20th, in the Humber, by three French prisoners who had escaped from Norman Cross.
In November 1809, two French Navy officers escaped by secreting themselves in the soil carts of the prison, in which they were drawn out of the confines of the depot.

In December 1809 an inquest took place on Jean Barthelemy Toohe, a French prisoner of war who, as he was endeavouring to make his escape over the pailing of the prison, was fired at by the sentinel on duty; the ball entered his back, and he died shortly afterwards.

Duelling continued amongst prisoners. On 15 May 1811 at Norman Cross, two fought with scissors attached to sticks. One duellist wounded the survivor twice, before the latter made the thrust that proved fatal. It was reported that &quot;On Saturday the 19th an inquisition was taken at Norman Cross Barracks, on view of the body of Julien Cheral, a French prisoner of war, who met his death by a fellow prisoner of the name of Jean Francois Pons stabbing. Verdict — Self Defence.&quot;

In January 1812, a French prisoner was shot whilst escaping after he had overpowered a guard and stolen a bayonet. The guard was committed to Huntingdon Gaol for the next assizes on a charge of manslaughter.

In August 1812 Prosper Louis, 7th Duke of Arenberg, was sent to Norman Cross after refusing to conform to the new reporting rules of his parole at Bridgnorth, where he was staying with his wife, Stéphanie Tascher de La Pagerie (a niece of Empress Joséphine). After a period, he agreed to follow the reporting requirement and was paroled again.

During August 1813, escaped prisoners from Norman Cross were discovered as far away as Hampshire.

== Military units ==

In July 1810 the Northumberland Militia were inspected at the barracks by Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland. After he had reviewed them, the duke presented the commanding officer with £150 for the regiment to regale themselves with.
On 22 April 1812 the Edinburgh Militia relieved the 2nd West York at Yaxley barracks, and the latter regiment marched to Colchester. However, the Edinburgh&#x27;s Militia were soon sent north to deal with Luddite machine-breaking and with a very large group of French prisoners arriving from the Peninsula the guards had to be reinforced quickly. The Bedfordshire Militia were sent from Littlehampton in wagons changed at each town, the officers in post chaises, the journey of taking just six days (29 April to 4 May).

Men from the following units were stationed at the prison:
==Arrival and repatriation==

Many of the prisoners arrived via Portsmouth or Plymouth and were marched hundreds of miles to Norman Cross.

In April 1797 six transports having on board near 1,000 French prisoners disembarked at King&#x27;s Lynn from Falmouth. The prisoners, under an escort of the Lincoln Militia marched from there to Norman Cross. Most prisoners arrived on foot from Portsmouth, Plymouth, Hull, Great Yarmouth, and other ports.
In October 1797, 300 prisoners embarked from Peterborough quay to be exchanged. The sea trip to the continent was by cartel ship. When the first peace was proclaimed, prisoners were taken to Wisbech in lighters to join others in Wisbech Gaol to depart from the Port of Wisbech for France.

Not all prisoners waited for repatriation after the end of the war. A number of the Dutch prisoners expressed their readiness to enlist into the service of Britain. In January 1807 upwards of 60 of them, whose services had been accepted, were marched under an escort of the Pembrokeshire Militia, to Portsmouth, to be distributed on board ships of war.

Peace was finally proclaimed with France in 1814, following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat and consequent abdication. The prisoners, the garrison guards and local people joined together in celebrations. The first division of 500 prisoners left on 5 April. The Star reported &quot;We are sorry to add that on their way to the sea coast for embarkation, a few indulged in drinking to such excess, that two of them perished in a fit of intoxication, and nearly thirty were left on the road unable to proceed to their native land. They carry home with them about six thousand pounds in English money, being the profits on the sale of the toys, &amp;c. which they manufactured at the depot&quot;.

The remaining prisoners left the garrison by June 1814. A few decided to remain in England and settled near Yaxley and Stilton.

==Demolition and survivals==

In April 1815, &quot;1,000 Yards of capital Board Fencing, now standing round the burial ground appropriated to the late French prisoners, near Norman Cross Inn&quot; were advertised for sale.
The wooden buildings were dismantled in June 1816 and the parts sold at auction. Some of the buildings were relocated to nearby towns although much of the timber structures were sold as firewood.

The site is considered of national importance and has been classified as a scheduled monument. The commander of the depot was the agent and his house survives, as the Old Governor&#x27;s House. The restored stables are now a privately owned art gallery. Norman House, the barrack master&#x27;s house, also survives. Both the Old Governor&#x27;s House and Norman House are Grade II listed buildings.

== Memorial ==

The memorial to the 1,770 prisoners who died at Norman Cross was erected in 1914 by the Entente Cordiale Society beside the Great North Road. The bronze Imperial Eagle was stolen in 1990, but replaced with a new one in 2005 following a fundraising appeal.

When a section of the A1 was upgraded to motorway standard in 1998 the memorial required relocating. On 2 April 2005, the Duke of Wellington, a patron of the appeal, unveiled the restored memorial on a new site beside the A15. A replacement bronze eagle, sculpted by John Doubleday, was placed on the re-sited column.

== Study ==
An archaeological dig was carried out on part of the site by Channel 4 series &quot;Time Team&quot; in 2009. Part of the wall, an accommodation block, ablution hut and burial ground were uncovered. The episode, &quot;Death and Dominoes: The First POW Camp&quot;, of series 17 of &quot;Time Team&quot; was broadcast in October 2010.

<text>The Sentencing Project is a Washington, D.C.–based research and advocacy centre working for decarceration in the United States and seeking to address racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The organisation produces nonpartisan reports and research for use by state and federal policymakers, administrators, and journalists.

==History==
The Sentencing Project grew out of pilot programs established by lawyer Malcolm C. Young in the early 1980s. In 1981, Young became the director of a project of the National Legal Aid &amp; Defender Association (NLADA) designed to establish defence-based sentencing advocacy programs. In 1986, Young incorporated The Sentencing Project as an independent organisation to continue NLADA&#x27;s program of training and development work. In the late 1980s, The Sentencing Project became engaged in research and public education on a broad range of criminal justice policy issues. 

==Advocacy==
The Sentencing Project works with other organisations and public officials to influence criminal justice policies at the federal, state, and local level. The Sentencing Project was part of a national coalition supporting the bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act in the 114th Congress. The organisation&#x27;s executive director testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the legislation.

In 2010, The Sentencing Project contributed to the passage of the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparities in sentences associated with convictions for possessing or trafficking in crack cocaine compared to powder cocaine. Representatives of the organisation have often testified before Congress, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and other government and scholarly meetings.

== Research ==
In 2016, The Sentencing Project was active in the national debate about racial and ethnic disparities in arrests, sentencing and incarceration, and has monitored and reported on the denial of voting rights to individuals with felony convictions. It consistently criticises what it considers the ineffectiveness and excessive public expense associated with mass incarceration and extended prison terms.

In 2016, the organisation produced a state-by-state breakdown on the disenfranchisement of citizens convicted of felonies entitled &quot;Six Million Lost Voters&quot;. It documented 6.1 million potential voters, including more than 4 million who had long since completed their sentences, unable to participate because of state laws disenfranchising them. Florida, a perennial swing state, led the country with 1.5 million people convicted of felonies who could not vote. 

In recent years, The Sentencing Project has published reports and research on mandatory minimum sentences and their impact on judicial discretion; the increased reliance in the courts on life sentences, often without opportunities for parole; prison closures and repurposing; the impact of racial perceptions in criminal justice policy; the war on drugs and its collateral consequences; juvenile justice issues; women in prison; the children of prisoners and the long-term social impact of mass incarceration policies. 

== Leadership ==
Marc Mauer has been the executive director of The Sentencing Project since 2005. He has authored a number of books, articles, and studies about the criminal justice system. University of Pittsburgh School of Law professor David Harris called Mauer &quot;the go-to guy for any major media organization or any legislative body that wants the truth on what&#x27;s been happening with our prisons and our jails ... His testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in October 2015 ... should be required reading for every public official in this country.&quot;

The Sentencing Project is governed by a 10-member board of lawyers, academics, and practitioners, chaired by American University law professor Cynthia E. Jones.

<text>Ernest Thompson Seton (born Ernest Evan Thompson; August 14, 1860 – October 23, 1946) was a Canadian and American author, wildlife artist, founder of the Woodcraft Indians in 1902 (renamed Woodcraft League of America), and one of the founding pioneers of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) in 1910.

Seton also influenced Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scouting movement. His writings were published in the United Kingdom, Canada, the US, and the USSR; his notable books related to Scouting include &quot;The Birch Bark Roll&quot; and the &quot;Boy Scout Handbook&quot;. He incorporated what he believed to be American Indian elements into the traditions of the BSA.

== Early life ==

Seton was born in South Shields, County Durham, England of Scottish parents. His family emigrated to British North America in 1866. After settling in Lindsay, Canada West Seton spent most (after 1870) of his childhood in Toronto, and the family is known to have lived at 6 Aberdeen Avenue in Cabbagetown. As a youth, he retreated to the woods of the Don River to draw and study animals as a way of avoiding his abusive father. He attended the Ontario College of Art in 1879, studying with John Colin Forbes, then won a scholarship in art to the Royal Academy in London, England in 1880. In the 1890s, he studied at the Académie Julian in Paris In 1893-4, he was elected an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

On Seton&#x27;s 21st birthday his father presented him with an invoice for all of the expenses connected with his childhood and youth, including the fee charged by the doctor who delivered him. According to one writer, he paid the bill, but never spoke to his father again. In his autobiography, &quot;Trail of An Artist-naturalist: The Autobiography of Ernest Thompson Seton&quot;, he discusses the incident in detail, but, since he hadn&#x27;t &quot;a cent of money,&quot; he could not pay his father. He went immediately to work and used the money he made to leave the household forever.

In 1882, he joined his brother on a homestead outside Carberry, Manitoba, where he began to write. In 1891, he published &quot;The Birds of Manitoba&quot; and was appointed Provincial Naturalist by the government of Manitoba. He continued to publish books about Manitoba for decades to come, including &quot;The Life Histories of Northern Animals: An Account of the Mammals of Manitoba&quot; and lived in Manitoba, before moving to New York and Connecticut. In 1930, when he moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

He changed his name to Ernest Thompson Seton (after initially changing it to Ernest Seton-Thompson), believing that Seton had been an important family name. He became successful as a writer, artist, and naturalist, and moved to New York City to further his career. Seton later lived at Wyndygoul, an estate that he built in Cos Cob, a section of Greenwich, Connecticut. After experiencing vandalism by the local youth, Seton invited them to his estate for a weekend where he told them what he claimed were stories of the American Indians and of nature. Seton was an early and influential member of the Camp-Fire Club of America, hosting several of the club&#x27;s earliest official events at his Wyndygoul estate. 

He formed the Woodcraft Indians in 1902 and invited the local youth to join. Despite the name, the group was made up of non-native boys and girls. The stories became a series of articles written for the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, and were eventually collected in &quot;The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians&quot; in 1906. Shortly after, the Woodcraft Indians evolved into the Woodcraft Rangers, which was established as a non-profit organization for youth programming in 1922.

Since 1922, Woodcraft Rangers has served Los Angeles youth with Seton&#x27;s model of character building, which encompasses service, truth, fortitude, and beauty. Since then, Woodcraft Rangers youth have been received in a safe environment to encourage the discovery of their own talents. Today the Woodcraft Rangers organization serves over 15,000 youth in the Los Angeles county by helping them find pathways to purposeful lives. They offer expanded learning opportunities to youth from kindergarten to twelfth grade. Youth participants are encouraged to discover their natural talents and are embraced daily with the belief that all children are innately good.

== Scouting ==

Seton met Scouting&#x27;s founder, Lord Baden-Powell, in 1906. Baden-Powell had read Seton&#x27;s book &quot;The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians&quot; and was greatly intrigued by it. The pair met and shared ideas. Baden-Powell went on to found the Scouting movement worldwide and Seton became the president of the committee that founded the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and was its first (and only) Chief Scout. Seton&#x27;s &quot;Woodcraft Indians&quot; (a youth organization) combined with the early attempts at Scouting from the YMCA and other organizations and with Daniel Carter Beard&#x27;s Sons of Daniel Boone, to form the BSA. The work of Seton and Beard is in large part the basis of the Traditional Scouting movement.

Seton served as Chief Scout of the BSA from 1910 to 1915 and incorporated what he believed to be American Indian elements into the traditions of the BSA. He had significant personality and philosophical clashes with Beard and James E. West.

In addition to disputes about the content of Seton&#x27;s contributions to the Boy Scout Handbook, conflicts also arose about the suffragist activities of his wife, Grace Gallatin Seton Thompson, and his British citizenship. The citizenship issue arose partly because of his high position within the BSA and the federal charter West was attempting to obtain for the BSA requiring its board members to be United States citizens. Seton drafted his written resignation on January 29, 1915, but did not send it to the BSA until May. The position of Chief Scout was eliminated and the position &quot;Chief Scout Executive&quot; was taken on by James West. In 1931, Seton became a United States citizen.

== Personal life ==

British by birth, Seton was not naturalized as Canadian (as status did not legally exist until 1947; he thus remained a British subject) and became an American in 1931. He was married twice. His first marriage was to Grace Gallatin in 1896. Their only daughter, Ann (1904–1990), later known as Anya Seton, became a best-selling author of historical and biographical novels. According to Ann&#x27;s introduction to the novel &quot;Green Darkness&quot;, Grace was a practicing Theosophist.

Ernest and Grace divorced in 1935, and Ernest soon married Julia Moss Buttree. Julia wrote works by herself and with Ernest. They did not have any biological children, but in the 1930s they sought to adopt Moss Buttree&#x27;s niece, Leila Moss, who lived with them for years in New Mexico. In 1938, they adopted an infant daughter, Beulah (Dee) Seton (later Dee Seton Barber). Dee Seton Barber, a talented embroiderer of articles for synagogues such as Torah mantles, died in 2006.

Seton called his father, Joseph Logan Thompson, &quot;the most selfish man I ever knew, or heard of, in history or in fiction.&quot; He cut off ties completely after being made to pay off an itemized list of all expenses he had cost his father, up to and including the doctor&#x27;s fee for his delivery, a total of $537.50.

Seton&#x27;s parents lived out their lives in Toronto, as did brother John Enoch Thompson (abt. 1846–1932).

Two brothers, Joseph Logan Thompson (1849–1922) and Charles Seton Thompson (1851–1925), moved to British Columbia. Besides Seton, George Seton Thompson (1854–1944) moved to Illinois and died there.

==Writing and later life==
Seton was an early pioneer of the modern school of animal fiction writing, his most popular work being &quot;Wild Animals I Have Known&quot; (1898), which contains the story of his killing of the wolf Lobo. Four stories from this collection would be republished as &quot;Lobo, Rag, and Vixen&quot; (1900). He later became involved in a literary debate known as the nature fakers controversy, after John Burroughs published an article in 1903 in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; attacking writers of sentimental animal stories. The controversy lasted for four years and included important American environmental and political figures of the day, including President Theodore Roosevelt.

For his work, &quot;Lives of Game Animals Volume 4&quot;, Seton was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1928. In 1931, he became a United States citizen. Seton was associated with the Santa Fe arts and literary community during the mid-1930s and early 1940s, which was a group of artists and authors, including author and artist Alfred Morang, sculptor and potter Clem Hull, painter Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, painter Randall Davey, painter Raymond Jonson, leader of the Transcendental Painters Group and artist Eliseo Rodriguez. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

In 1933, Seton purchased in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, United States. Seton ran training camps for youth leaders and had a small publisher named Seton Village Press that closed in 1943 due to World War II. The tract eventually grew to . Seton Village was established as an unincorporated community.

Seton designed and built his castle as a 32-room, multi-level building with a flat-roof and rough hewn stone wall exterior. The interior had oak floors and plaster walls with the ceilings supported by log rafters. The castle was built on a hill at an elevation of . It is designated a National Historic Landmark and a New Mexico State Cultural Property. The castle burned down while being restored in 2005. The Academy for the Love of Learning, which owns the property, has decided to preserve the castle ruins as a &quot;contemplative garden&quot;.

==Death==
He died in Seton Village, New Mexico, at the age of 86. Seton was cremated in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1960, in honor of his 100th birthday and the 350th anniversary of Santa Fe, his daughter, Dee and his grandson, Seton Cottier (son of Anya), scattered the ashes over Seton Village from an airplane.

==Legacy==

The Philmont Scout Ranch houses the Seton Memorial Library and Museum. Seton Castle in Santa Fe, built by Seton as his last residence, housed many of his other items. Seton Castle burned down in 2005 during an attempt at restoration, but all the artwork, manuscripts, books, etc., had been removed to storage before renovation was to have begun.

The Academy for the Love of Learning, an educational organization in Santa Fe, acquired Seton Castle and its contents in 2003. The new Academy Center that opened in 2011 includes a gallery and archives featuring artwork and other materials as part of its Seton Legacy Project. The Seton Legacy Project organized a major exhibition on Seton opening at the New Mexico History Museum on May 23, 2010, the catalog published as &quot;Ernest Thompson Seton: The Life and Legacy of an Artist and Conservationist&quot; by David L. Witt.

Roger Tory Peterson drew inspiration for his field guide from the simple diagram of ducks that Seton included in &quot;Two Little Savages&quot;.

Seton is honored by the Ernest Thompson Seton Scout Reservation in Greenwich, Connecticut, and with the E.T. Seton Park in Toronto, Ontario. Obtained in the early 1960s as the site of the future Metro Toronto Zoo, the land was later used to establish parkland and home to the Ontario Science Centre. A plaque is found on the front wall of 6 Aberdeen Avenue in Toronto, where Seton had lived as a child.

=== In pop culture ===

==== In television ====
&quot;&quot; (, &quot;Seton Doubutsuki: Kuma no Ko Jacky&quot;) was a 26-episode anime television series based on Seton&#x27;s novel of the same name, and was first broadcast in 1977.

In 1979, a 26-episode anime series based on Seton&#x27;s 1922 book &quot;Bannertail: The Story of a Gray Squirrel&quot; was produced in Japan by Nippon Animation, called (, &quot;Shīton Dōbutsuki Risu no Banā&quot;).

In 1989–1990, Eiken released &quot;Seton Dōbutsuki&quot; (, &#x27;&quot;Seton Animal Chronicles&quot;&#x27;), a 45-episode anime TV series adapted from the manga &quot;Seton&#x27;s Wild Animals&quot; (), depicting the different literary works of Seton, including his 1898 &quot;Wild Animals I Have Known&quot;. &quot;Lobo, the King of Currumpaw&quot; (episodes 17 and 18) was a notable episode of the show which many viewers later learned of when the storyline was plotted into a popular 2009 TV documentary entitled &quot;The Wolf That Changed America&quot;. The cartoon was dubbed in German and Arabic and saw an emerging popularity among Arabs in the early 1990s as &quot;Mokhles Sadik ul Hayawaan&quot; (, &quot;&#x27;Mokhles, Animals&#x27; Friend&quot;&#x27;).

&quot;Chink, the Development of a Pup&quot; was adapted into a cartoon in Russian in 1992.

In October 2015, the Comedy Central show &quot;Drunk History&quot; gave a short, drunk history lesson by Mike Still (season 3, episode 10, second act) in which Seton is portrayed by Colin Hanks. It mostly concentrates on the story of Lobo, but also mentions the roots of the Boy Scouts and helping out troubled teens.

====In literature and manga====
The five-volume manga &quot;Seton&#x27;s Wild Animals&quot; () by Sanpei Shirato, published between 1961 and 1965, portrayed the various literary works of Seton. Kenji Uchiyama translated Seton&#x27;s work for the manga from English into Japanese.

In 1988, Yury Iosifovich Koval published a short novel called &quot;Шамайка&quot; (&quot;Shamayka&quot;), a retelling of &quot;The Slum Cat&quot;.

In a 1993 issue of the Japanese manga &quot;Diamond is Unbreakable&quot;, the character Jotaro Kujo references Seton&#x27;s quote &quot;there is no animal that cannot be tracked&quot;.

Several of Seton&#x27;s works are written from the perspective of a predator and were an influence upon Robert T. Bakker&#x27;s &quot;Raptor Red&quot; (1995).

From 2004–2006, manga artist Jiro Taniguchi and scenarist Yoshiharu Imaizumi published &quot;Shīton&quot; (), a four-volume manga romanticizing the life of Seton. These manga were not translated into English, but appeared in French, Italian and Spanish. The French titles are:
# &quot;Lobo, le Roi des Loups&quot; (&#x27;Lobo, King of Wolves&#x27;)
# &quot;Le jeune garçon et le lynx&quot; (&#x27;The Young boy and the Lynx&#x27;)
# &quot;Sandhill Stag&quot; (&#x27;Sandhill Stag&#x27;)
# &quot;Monarch, l&#x27;ours du mont Tallac&quot; (Monarch, Mount Tallac Bear)

Seton&#x27;s appearance inspired the design of the character Shiton Anehata, a scholar and zoophile who is one of the Abashiri convicts in the manga &quot;Golden Kamui&quot;.

Seton is also mentioned in Philip Roth&#x27;s 2010 novel, &quot;Nemesis&quot;, where he is credited for having introduced Indian lore to the American camping movement.

<doc id="76522" wikidata="Q6529406" url="?curid=76522" title="Les Dawson">
<text>Leslie Dawson (2 February 1931 – 10 June 1993) was an English comedian, actor, writer, presenter, and pianist. He was known for his deadpan style, curmudgeonly persona, musical routines, and jokes about his mother-in-law and wife.

==Early life==
Les Dawson was born in Collyhurst, Manchester, on 2 February 1931, the only child of bricklayer Leslie Dawson (2 August 1905 – 10 April 1970) and Julia Nolan (14 January 1908 – 29 September 1957), who was of Irish descent. His first job was in the parcels department of the Manchester Co-op. He worked briefly as a journalist on the &quot;Bury Times&quot;.

==Career==
Early in life, Dawson wrote poetry and kept it secret. It was not expected that someone of his working class background would have literary ambitions. In a BBC Television documentary, he spoke of his love for canonical figures in English literature, in particular the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb, whose florid style influenced Dawson&#x27;s. He did, moreover, appear with The Nelson Players in Nelson, Lancashire as Mr. Justice Wainwright and Carter, chief clerk to Sir Wilfrid Robarts Q.C. in Agatha Christie&#x27;s play &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; in December 1956.

Dawson wrote in his autobiography that he had a job as a pianist in a Parisian brothel. Making a living as a pianist evolved into comedy when he got laughs from deliberately bad piano-playing by playing &quot;all the wrong notes in exactly the right order&quot; and complaining to the audience. He first rose to public prominence on the talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; in 1967 and worked as a comic on British television for the rest of his life.

Television series in which he appeared included the panel game &quot;Jokers Wild&quot; (1969–73) hosted by Barry Cryer, &quot;Sez Les&quot; (1969–76) and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (1975), all for Yorkshire Television. After joining the BBC, his TV projects were &quot;The Dawson Watch&quot; (1979–80), written by Andy Hamilton and Terry Ravenscroft, &quot;The Les Dawson Show&quot; (1978–89), written by Terry Ravenscroft, and the quiz show &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, which he presented from 1984 until its cancellation in 1990. Dawson starred in &quot;Listen to Les&quot; on BBC Radio 2 in the 1970s and 1980s.

He made many appearances on BBC Television&#x27;s variety show, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, in the 1970s and 1980s. Dawson co-hosted Prince Edward&#x27;s charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot; in 1987. When Richard Wilson turned down the part of Victor Meldrew in the BBC sitcom &quot;One Foot In The Grave&quot;, writer David Renwick considered Dawson for the role, but Wilson changed his mind before it was offered.

In 1991, Dawson starred in the BBC television production of &quot;Nona&quot;, an adaptation of the 1977 play &quot;La Nona&quot; (&quot;Grandma&quot;) by Roberto Cossa for the &quot;Performance&quot; series. Performing in drag, he was cast as a 100-year old, compulsive eater in a Buenos Aires household.

Dawson was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in December 1971 when Eamonn Andrews surprised him on &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;, and again 21 years later, in what would be one of his last television appearances, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel on stage at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, at the curtain call of the pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; in December 1992. His final TV appearance was on the LWT series &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot; hosted by Cilla Black, in which he sang a comic rendition of &quot;I Got You Babe&quot; with a woman from the audience who wanted to sing with him. The episode was aired shortly after his death.

Dawson was a heavy smoker and drinker. When not working he would often drink a bottle of whisky and smoke 50 cigarettes a day. Dawson was initiated into the famous show business fraternity, the Grand Order of Water Rats and served as that order&#x27;s &quot;King Rat&quot; in 1985.

Dawson also wrote novels. He told his second wife, Tracy, &quot;Always remind them – I was a writer too.&quot;

===Routines and image===
His characteristic routines featured Roy Barraclough and Dawson as elderly women, Cissie Braithwaite and Ada Shufflebotham. Barraclough&#x27;s character Cissie had pretensions of refinement and corrected Ada&#x27;s malapropisms or vulgar expressions. As authentic characters of their day, they spoke some words aloud but mouthed others, particularly those pertaining to bodily functions and sex. The characters were based on those Les Dawson knew in real life. He explained that this mouthing of words (or &quot;mee-mawing&quot;) was a habit of Lancashire millworkers communicating over the loud noise of looms, then resorted to in daily life for indelicate subjects. To further portray the reality of northern, working-class women, Cissie and Ada would sit with folded arms, occasionally adjusting their bosoms by a hoist of the forearms. Many Cissie and Ada sketches were written by Terry Ravenscroft. This was also typical of pantomime dame style, an act copied from his hero, Norman Evans and his act &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;. Les Dawson was portly and often dressed in John Bull costume. He introduced to his BBC television shows a dancing group of fat ladies called the Roly Polys. Dawson&#x27;s style as a comic was world-weary, lugubrious and earthy.

He was a talented pianist but developed a gag in which he played a familiar piece such as Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and then introduced hideously wrong notes (yet not destroying the tune) without appearing to realise, smiling unctuously and relishing the accuracy and soul of his own performance.

Having broken his jaw in a boxing match, he could pull grotesque faces by pulling his jaw over his upper lip. This is described in the first volume of Dawson&#x27;s autobiography &quot;A Clown Too Many&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Dawson was married to his first wife, Margaret, from 25 June 1960 until her death on 15 April 1986 from cancer. They had three children: Julie, Pamela and Stuart. Dawson nearly died in February 1985 from a failing prostate gland, complicated by blood poisoning. On 3 September 1988, he suffered a heart attack in Blackpool and spent nine days in hospital. He married his second wife, Tracy Roper, on 6 May 1989; she was 17 years younger. They had a daughter, Charlotte, who was born on 3 October 1992. He died suddenly, aged 62, on 10 June 1993 from a heart attack, during treatment for a heart complaint at St Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Longsight, Manchester.

==Legacy==
On 23 October 2008, 15 years after his death, a bronze statue by Graham Ibbeson was unveiled by his widow Tracy and daughter Charlotte in the ornamental gardens next to the pier in St Anne&#x27;s-on-Sea, Lancashire, where Dawson lived for many years.

In the &quot;Comedians&#x27; Comedian&quot;, a three-hour programme on UK&#x27;s Channel 4 on 1 January 2005, Dawson was 37th in the top 50 comedians of all time, voted by fellow comedians and business insiders.

The BBC broadcast, on BBC Two, &quot;The Many Faces of Les Dawson&quot;, a retrospective, on Christmas Eve 2011.

On 1 June 2013 ITV broadcast &quot;Les Dawson: An Audience with That Never Was&quot;. The programme featured a Pepper&#x27;s ghost projection of Dawson, presenting content for a 1993 edition of &quot;An Audience with...&quot; to be hosted by Dawson but unused due to his death two weeks before recording. The show served as a tribute and featured celebrities including Bruce Forsyth, Cilla Black, Terry Wogan and Ken Dodd. Also among the audience were Dawson&#x27;s widow Tracy and daughter Charlotte.

On 10 February 2014, the BBC reported that Dawson&#x27;s daughter Charlotte had found a 110-page &quot;unpublished story of love and mystery, titled &quot;An Echo of Shadows&quot;, [that] was written under the name Maria Brett-Cooper...&quot;.

In 2020, Les Dawson&#x27;s early years in Paris were portrayed in Sky Arts&#x27; series &quot;Urban Myths&quot; in the episode &quot;Les Dawson&#x27;s Parisienne Adventure&quot;, with Mark Addy as the older Les and John Bradley as young Les.

In 2022, Jon Culshaw portrayed Dawson as part of The Edinburgh Assembly&#x27;s Fringe programme.

<text>Sherry Turkle (born June 18, 1948) is an American sociologist. She is the Abby Rockefeller Mauzé Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She obtained a BA in social studies and later a PhD in sociology and personality psychology at Harvard University. She now focuses her research on psychoanalysis and human-technology interaction. She has written several books focusing on the psychology of human relationships with technology, especially in the realm of how people relate to . Her memoir &#x27;Empathy Diaries&#x27; received excellent critical reviews.

== Writings ==

In &quot;The Second Self&quot;, she writes about how computers are not tools as much as they are a part of our social and psychological lives, writing that technology &quot;catalyzes changes not only in what we do but in how we think.” She goes on using Jean Piaget&#x27;s psychology discourse to discuss how children learn about computers and how this affects their minds. &quot;The Second Self&quot; was received well by critics and was praised for being “a very thorough and ambitious study.”

In &quot;Life on the Screen&quot;, Turkle discusses how emerging technology, specifically computers, affect the way we think and see ourselves as humans. She presents to us the different ways in which computers affect us, and how it has led us to the now prevalent use of &quot;cyberspace.&quot; Turkle suggests that assuming different personal identities in a MUD (i.e. computer fantasy game) may be therapeutic. She also considers the problems that arise when using MUDs. Turkle discusses what she calls women&#x27;s &quot;non-linear&quot; approach to the technology, calling it &quot;soft mastery&quot; and &quot;bricolage&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;hard mastery&quot; of linear, abstract thinking and computer programming). She discusses problems that arise when children pose as adults online.

Turkle also explores the psychological and societal impact of such &quot;relational artifacts&quot; as social robots, and how these and other technologies are changing attitudes about human life and living things generally. One result may be a devaluation of authentic experience in a relationship.
Together with Seymour Papert she wrote the influential paper &quot;Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete.&quot;
Turkle has written numerous articles on psychoanalysis and culture and on the &quot;subjective side&quot; of people&#x27;s relationships with technology, especially computers. She is engaged in active study of robots, digital pets, and simulated creatures, particularly those designed for children and the elderly as well as in a study of mobile cellular technologies. Profiles of Turkle have appeared in such publications as The New York Times, Scientific American, and Wired Magazine. She is a featured media commentator on the effects of technology for CNN, NBC, ABC, and NPR, including appearances on such programs as Nightline and 20/20.

Turkle has begun to assess the adverse effects of rapidly advancing technology on human social behavior. &quot;Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other&quot; was published in 2011 and when discussing the topic she speaks about the need to limit the use of popular technological devices because of these adverse effects.

==Early life and education==
Sherry Turkle was born in Brooklyn on June 18, 1948. After she graduated as a valedictorian from Abraham Lincoln High School in 1965, she began her studies at Radcliffe College, graduating in 1969 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Social Studies. She then obtained a master&#x27;s degree in sociology in 1973 and a doctorate in Sociology and Personality Psychology in 1976, both from Harvard University. Inspired by her time in France during her undergraduate years, she did her dissertation research in France, &quot;writing about the relationship between Freudian thought and the modern French revolutionary movements.&quot; This relationship was also the subject of her first book, &quot;Psychoanalytic Politics: Jacques Lacan and Freud&#x27;s French Revolution&quot;. Turkle has been married twice, first to MIT researcher Seymour Papert, and then to consultant Ralph Willard. Both marriages ended in divorce.

==&quot;The Second Self&quot;==

In &quot;The Second Self&quot; (1984), Turkle defines the computer as more than just a tool, but part of our everyday personal and psychological lives. She looks at how computers affect the way we look at ourselves and our relationships with others, claiming that technology defines the way we think and act. Turkle&#x27;s book allows us to view and reevaluate our own relationships with technology.

In her process of evaluating our relationships with computers, Turkle interviews children, college students, engineers, AI scientists, hackers and personal computer owners in order to further understand our relationships with computers and how we interact with them on a personal level. The interviews showed that computers are both a part of our selves as well as part of the external world. In this book, Turkle tries to figure out why we think of computers in such psychological terms, how this happens and what this means for all of us.

==&quot;Life on the Screen&quot;==

In &quot;Life on the Screen&quot; (1995), Turkle presents a study of how people&#x27;s use of the computer has evolved over time, and the profound effect that this machine has on its users. The computer, which connects millions of people across the world together, is changing the way we think and see ourselves. Although it was originally intended to serve as a tool to help us to write and communicate with others, it has more recently transformed into a means of providing us with virtual worlds which we can step into and interact with other people. The book discusses how our everyday interactions with computers affect our minds and the way we think about ourselves. In particular, interacting with these virtual worlds, especially through language, can shift a unitary sense of self into one with a multiplicity of identities.

Turkle also discusses the way our human identity is changing due to the fading boundary between humans and computers, and how people now have trouble distinguishing between humans and machines. It used to be thought that humans were nothing like machines, because humans had feelings and machines did not. However, as technology has improved, computers have become more and more human-like, and these boundaries had to be redrawn. People now compare their own minds to machines, and talk to them freely without any shame or embarrassment. Turkle questions our ethics in defining and differentiating between real life and simulated life.

==&quot;Alone Together&quot;==
In &quot;Alone Together&quot; (2011), Turkle explores how technology is changing the way we communicate. In particular, Turkle raises concerns about the way in which genuine, organic social interactions become degraded through constant exposure to illusory meaningful exchanges with artificial intelligence. Underlying Turkle&#x27;s central argument is the fact that the technological developments which have most contributed to the rise of inter-connectivity have at the same time bolstered a sense of alienation between people. The alienation involves links between social networks favouring those of proper conversations.

Turkle&#x27;s main argument in the first part of the book is that our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle&#x27;s concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.

The second part of the book examines the nature of online social interactions, and the way in which social media has changed how people, particularly younger people, connect with one another. Turkle argues that because people in interpersonal social situations, particularly young people, are often distracted by their phones, they will pay insufficient attention to one another, creating increasingly shallow relationships. Turkle argues that teenagers&#x27; reliance on friends&#x27; advice prevents self-reflection, leading to less personal independence.

Turkle talks about the nature of privacy in the post 9/11 world, arguing that privacy was sacrificed in exchange for safety. Turkle argues that because they have grown up as part of a world in which privacy is regarded as increasingly tenuous, children do not always appreciate the full value of privacy, which in turn causes them to share even more personal details on the web. This further depreciates the value of privacy in a self-perpetuating cycle.

Using her 15 year of experience, Turkle uses &quot;Alone Together&quot; to explore the question of whether or not technology is bringing quality to our lives. Turkle argues people use technology to escape from reality and emotions, which weakens genuine relationships.

In 2011, Turkle was interviewed by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report, where she spoke briefly about &quot;Alone Together&quot;, and the impact that technology has on communication skills.

Turkle gave a TED talk on the subject of &quot;Alone Together&quot; in February 2012, under the title “Connected, but alone?”

== &quot;Reclaiming Conversation&quot; ==
&quot;Reclaiming Conversation and The Power of Talk in A Digital Age&quot; (2015) is Turkle&#x27;s examination of evolving interpersonal and intrapersonal communications. In the preamble, Turkle cites Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s Walden as providing guidance for the structure of the book: &quot;I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for society.&quot; This book is thus divided into three general parts: a single chair for intrapersonal communication, two chairs concerning the importance of conversations in friendships, families and romances, and three chairs for interpersonal communication such as in school, work, and politics. Turkle gathered data from schools, companies, families, and articulates the statistical and psychoanalytic barriers that have forced users to &quot;sacrifice conversation for mere connection&quot;. This trade-off in interwoven intimacies and apps ultimately withholds the necessary &quot;face-to-face experiences that are needed for generating authentic connection&quot;.

The capacity to interact on a personal or private basis is the cornerstone to empathy, and Turkle argues that loneliness is also essential to this. Paradoxically, Turkle presents the blossoming of technologies role in our reconciliation of lonely experiences and maintaining close social interactions. While access to mobile devices can empower connections with pre-existing relationships, it can also harm the general sense of solitude and ability to meet personal and social standards on a grander scale. The ability to connect through technology then becomes the compromise that chatting online is &quot;better than nothing&quot;.

Turkle gave a talk for Google about her book &quot;Reclaiming Conversation.&quot;

Aziz Ansari responded to &quot;Reclaiming Conversation&quot; by saying, &quot;In a time in which the ways we communicate and connect are constantly changing, and not always for the better, Sherry Turkle provides a much needed voice of caution and reason to help explain what the f*** is going on.&quot;

<text>The Order of the Arrow (OA) is the honor society of Scouting America, composed of Scouts and Scouters who best exemplify the Scout Oath and Law in their daily lives as elected by their peers. It was founded as a camp fraternity by E. Urner Goodman, with the assistance of Carroll A. Edson, in 1915. Although it began without the approval of what was then the Boy Scouts of America, it was eventually admitted as an &quot;Official Experiment&quot; of the organization. In 1948, following an extensive review, it became a program of Scouting America.

Inducted members, known as &quot;Arrowmen&quot; or &quot;Brothers&quot; (regardless of gender; as Scouting America and its programs are open to all genders), are organized into local youth-led Lodges that harbor fellowship, promote camping, and render service to scout councils and their communities. Each lodge corresponds to a council in the area. Lodges are further broken down into chapters, which correspond to districts within a council. Members wear identifying insignia on their uniforms, most notably the pocket flap that represents their individual lodge and the sash worn at official OA functions. The OA program sponsors several events, awards, and training functions.

Scouting America maintains that the Order of the Arrow is not a secret organization. It utilizes the “attractiveness of the unknown” in its ceremonies to create a perception of mystery among non-members. There are three main ceremonies for the three membership levels: Ordeal, Brotherhood, and Vigil. These ceremonies are recognition of a scout’s leadership qualities, camping skills, and other Scouting ideals as exemplified by their elected peers. Additionally, &quot;safeguarded” (privy only to members and legitimately interested adults) symbols and handshakes are used to impart a sense of community. Since the 1980s, concerned parents, Scout leaders, and religious leaders may review the ceremony through a process set by the Order of the Arrow, and parents can refuse for their child to take part in the ceremony as membership is voluntary.

It has foundations influenced by Freemasonry and previously used imagery commonly associated with American Indian cultures for its self-invented ceremonies. Native Americans have criticized the OA&#x27;s various symbols and &quot;rituals&quot; as cultural appropriation based on non-Native stereotypes of American Indians. Its Freemason ties have also been source of debates, in spite of its systematic removal of masonic terminology in the 1930s to avoid offending religious groups.

==Origins==
The Order of the Arrow was started as a Camp Fraternity by E. Urner Goodman, newly assigned Director of Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River and assistant Camp Director Carroll A. Edson under the name of &quot;Wimachtendienk Wingolauchsik Witahemui&quot;. It was seen as a way to improve the summer camp experience and to encourage older Scouts to continue attending the summer camp. It was not part of Boy Scouts of America at the time. The name was based on the Lënape dialect.

In 1921, the &quot;known&quot; Lodges organized themselves under a Grand Lodge as inspired by the Freemasons. A new Constitution was written and the ceremonies used in the early years were rewritten. The following year, it became an Official Experiment of the Boy Scouts of America.

Throughout the 1930s, the Order of the Arrow went through a full review. The terminology used by the order was slowly replaced to sound less masonic and more Native American. This was a requirement from the Boy Scouts of America who wished to not offend the religious groups that represented almost half of their charter organizations at the time and this needed to happen before the OA could be fully integrated in BSA.

By 1948, two-thirds of the BSA&#x27;s councils had OA Lodges. That same year, it announced at the 1948 NOAC that the Order of the Arrow was integrated as an official part of Boy Scouts of America Program.

==Membership==
Nearly 100,000 youth and adults are members of the Order of the Arrow as of 2023. Unit elections of the OA are allowed in Scouts BSA, Venturing, and Sea Scout units.

There are three levels of membership:
* Ordeal
*Brotherhood
*Vigil Honor

Honorary membership was once bestowed in special circumstances, as with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, but this practice was officially discontinued in 1953.

==Organization==

The Order of the Arrow places great emphasis on being a youth-led organization. Only youth under the age 21 are voting members and are eligible to hold elected offices. Professional and volunteer adults are appointed to non-voting advisory positions at the chapter, lodge, and section levels.

The smallest level of organization in the Order of the Arrow is the chapter. The chapter is usually corresponding to a district in the local council. The chapter is led by the elected youth chapter chief, chapter vice chiefs, secretary, and a volunteer adult is appointed as the adviser, the district executive is the professional (staff) adviser. The chapters often hold monthly or weekly meetings together. The next largest unit of the OA is the lodge, which is chartered by a local BSA council. The lodge chief is the elected youth leader, the lodge adviser is a BSA adult volunteer appointed by the Scout Executive, and the lodge staff adviser is the council Scout executive or his designated council professional Scouter. The lodge youth officers, consisting of the lodge chief, one or more vice chiefs, a secretary, and a treasurer are responsible for organizing and leading the various programs and activities of the lodge. Many lodges have standing committees responsible for ceremonies, service projects, publications, unit elections, camp promotions, and dance teams composed of youth members.

===Sections and Conclaves===
Lodges are grouped into sections that are then grouped into regions. The section chief is the elected youth leader, a volunteer adult is appointed as the section adviser, and the area director (or his designate) is the professional (staff) adviser. In addition to the section chief, the section has two additional elected officers. The vice chief and secretary are elected immediately following the election of the section chief at the section&#x27;s annual business meeting. All sections gather annually at a section conclave held in the late spring or early fall. It is the main duty of the section officers to lead the planning of this weekend with the help of the lodge chiefs in the section.

Like Scouting America’s Areas, The Order of the Arrow was formerly organized into four regions, Central, Southern, Northeast and Western Region; the boundaries of each OA region correspond with the boundaries of the BSA&#x27;s regions. As of 2021, following the Boy Scouts of America&#x27;s restructuring of these areas, the OA changed their region boundaries, now having only two. Each region has an elected region chief, a volunteer adult who is appointed as the region chairman to oversee its region Committee, and an appointed professional (staff) adviser, forming a &#x27;Key Three&#x27; much like the Lodge and chapter system described above. Each region chief is elected at the national planning meeting the day after the election of the national chief and vice chief by a caucus of the section chiefs from the given region. The members of the region committee consist of the region chief, the region chair, all national committee members from the region, and other appointed adult volunteers. Each region annually has a gathering of all section officers and advisers. As a region, they are trained in topics relevant to their jobs. Each region also provides opportunities for Order of the Arrow members to go through a National Leadership Seminar. This weekend course is highly rated and a lasting memory for many members.

The national chief and the national vice chief are selected by a caucus of the section chiefs at the outset of the Order of the Arrow&#x27;s national planning meeting. At the national level, the OA is headed by the National Order of the Arrow committee of which the national chief and national vice chief are voting members. The national adult leadership includes the volunteer national chairman and the OA director, a professional Scouter.

==Ceremonies and symbols==
Today, the Order of the Arrow is famous within Scouting America for its uniform symbols. There are two types of symbols:
* Degree/Honor Symbols that indicate the level of membership in the national Order of the Arrow
* Lodge Symbols that indicate the membership to a specific local Lodge

The lodge membership often takes center stage over the level of membership on the Scout uniform. The pocket flap is sewn permanently to the shirt pocket itself and is worn even in casual settings while the ribbon or the sash are only used in more formal settings.

There are four ceremonies following the Unit Elections of OA candidates:
* Call-Out or Tapout (public)
* Induction (Ordeal) (safeguarded)
* Brotherhood (safeguarded)
* Vigil Honor (safeguarded)

The requirements to take part in the ceremonies are public but the content of the ceremonies are considered &quot;safeguarded&quot; and not to be shared with non-members without proper vetting.

Ceremonies also utilize the OA Song, commonly referred to by its first line of lyrics as &quot;Firm Bound in Brotherhood&quot;, and titled &quot;Order of the Arrow Official Song&quot; and &quot;The Order of the Arrow Song&quot; in the printed music score of official OA publications. It was written in 1921 by OA founder E. Urner Goodman to the Russian hymn tune &quot;God Save the Tsar!&quot; (Боже, Царя храни!), composed by Alexei Lvov in 1833.

==Awards==

Awards are separate and distinct from the membership levels of Ordeal and Brotherhood. Awards available through the Order of the Arrow include:
* Vigil Honor
* Founder&#x27;s Award
* Distinguished Service Award
* Lifetime Achievement Award
* Red Arrow Award
* E. Urner Goodman Camping Award.

==Events==
The national OA committee also sponsors various national service opportunities, the oldest of which is the National OA Service Corps at the national Scout jamborees, at which Arrowmen have helped with many functions including shows and the Outdoor Adventure Program exhibit.

===High Adventure Program===

The Order of the Arrow sponsors service groups to the four National High Adventure Bases that focus on conservation. Inspired by three gentlemen, Edward Pease, Eugene &quot;Gene&quot; Schnell and Marty Tschetter, who gathered at a leadership summit at Philmont Scout Ranch in 1979, the Order of the Arrow High Adventure program was established. It originally started with the Order of the Arrow Trail Crew at the Philmont Scout Ranch working to build new trails and repair old ones. This expanded to the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases with the OA Wilderness Voyage, repairing the portage trails in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, and then to Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in 2005 with Ocean Adventure, which works to remove invasive species on some of the Keys and promoting and carrying out of the Bleach watch program in the Florida Keys. After the addition of the third High Adventure Base, the Order of the Arrow implemented the OA Triple Crown Award in the summer of 2009, the OA began the OA Canadian Odyssey program which provided service similar to the OA Wilderness Voyage to the Quetico Provincial Park. In 2014, The Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve began hosting the Order of the Arrow Summit Experience which gives service to the New River Gorge National River.

===National Order of the Arrow Conference===

The National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC) is a multi-day event which usually takes place on a university campus, bringing together thousands of delegates from OA lodges around the nation for training and activities. NOACs are held every two years, with exceptions made to align the event with significant anniversaries. As a youth-led organization, these national conferences are organized and directed by the elected section and region youth officers, who serve on committees responsible for various conference aspects under the leadership of the conference vice-chief. Events include training for programs, leadership and American Indian culture; competitions in athletics, ceremonies, cooking and American Indian dances; and exhibits on OA history, outdoor activities, and camping. There are also opportunities to talk with national leaders, perform service work and trade patches. Evening shows have different themes, including American Indian culture and recognition of dance competition winners, presentations of awards including the OA Distinguished Service Award and other entertainment.

==Training==
In addition to training courses available at a NOAC or section conclave, the OA offers specialized leadership training as weekend events for members: Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), National Leadership Seminars (NLS), and National Lodge Adviser Training Seminar (NLATS). LLD is a one-day or two-day event conducted by a lodge to train their officers and advisers. NLS&#x27;s are conducted by regions for lodge officers and advisers. Many lodges send key officers to receive training. Typically, each region schedules three or four NLS weekends annually, at geographically dispersed locations within the region. NLATS is a training event for adults, usually held in conjunction with an NLS and conducted by regions, on the role of advisers in the OA.

Largely considered the adult equivalent of the NLS program, NLATS&#x27;s primary objective was to provide advanced training to adults in each lodge. NLATS and NLS usually happened concurrently on the same weekend. The events were planned and executed by a staff of adults. After successful pilots in 2016, the Developing Youth Leadership Conference curriculum began replacing NLATS in early 2017.

==Use of Native American cultures==

Goodman and Edson, the founders of the Order of the Arrow, opted to portray what they saw as Native American characteristics &quot;as a sign of scouting excellence&quot;, and that the imagery, costuming, titles and imitation rituals &quot;evoked a primitivist exterior Indian Other, vanished from the modern world but still accessible through ritual and its accompanying objects.&quot; Goodman and Edson established the OA at Treasure Island Scout Reservation as a Scouting honor society &quot;based on a loose interpretation of&quot; &quot;Hiawatha&quot; and the novel &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. Inductions of new OA members at Treasure Island involved OA members meeting around bonfires in &quot;ritual Indian costume&quot;.

In the later twentieth century and beyond, the Order of the Arrow has been protested and criticized for engaging in cultural appropriation and spreading stereotypes of, and racism against, Native Americans. Protester concerns include OA&#x27;s imitation of Native American ceremonies, regalia, and artwork they consider to be offensive.

The Chief Seattle Council of Scouting America has written that modern ceremonies conducted by each OA lodge are &quot;influenced by&quot; the history and traditions of the Native American tribes indigenous to the areas the lodge serves, but use of Native American sacred objects by non-Native groups such as the Boy Scouts has been condemned by Native activists. Mother of former Scouts Ozheebeegay Ikwe writes, &quot;While native children in residential schools had their culture and language beaten from them, the Boy Scouts were using the language and their version of &#x27;Indian culture&#x27; in their OA ceremony.&quot; She called the OA&#x27;s use of headdresses, face paint, eagle feathers, and dancing with a pipe, &quot;downright offensive&quot;. After researching the OA and watching their ceremonies she said, &quot;Use of these items by Boy Scouts indicates that there is very little understanding of the Native people they claim to admire and respect.&quot; American anthropologist John H. Moore, an expert on North American Indian ethnology, wrote in an essay published in 1998 that &quot;of all the institutions in American society, the Boy Scouts of America have probably done the most damage in miseducating the public about Native American cultures...[the] Order of the Arrow annually initiates thousands of boys into the martial, romantic version of Indian culture through ceremonies drawn from the writings of Longfellow and James Fenimoore Cooper&quot;.

David Prochaska, professor in the University of Illinois History Department states the Order of the Arrow is one element that &quot;exemplifies the much larger phenomenon of &#x27;playing Indian&#x27;...Boy Scouts, Eagle Scouts, Order of the Arrow. Order of Red Men. Campfire Girls. Woodcraft. Boston Tea Party. &#x27;White Indians&#x27; – white New Agers as Native American &#x27;wannabes.&#x27; ... To pursue the argument a step further, what is &#x27;playing Indian,&#x27; &#x27;playing Native,&#x27; &#x27;playing an Other,&#x27; all about? It is about play, for one thing, in the sense of dressing up, masquerade, the Bakhtinian carnivalesque...It is also about appropriation, in the sense of taking on, assuming an other&#x27;s identity, taking another&#x27;s identity. The implication here is replacing one with another, silencing another, speaking for another.&quot;
Simon Mayo-Smith, a journalist and citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation explains the concern of using Native American Headpieces:
“The headdress is reserved for our revered elders who, through their selflessness and leadership, have earned the right to wear one. It’s a spiritual garb, not just cultural; it’s not merely an addition to one’s attire. Wearing one, even an imitation headdress, belittles what our elders have spent a lifetime to earn.”

On July 23, 2018, the National Order of the Arrow Committee announced that they had received &quot;many complaints surrounding these ceremonies from various American Indian tribes due to the manner in which they are conducted as well as the inconsistent nature in which they are performed.&quot; In 2019, the rules were changed: &quot;Scouts will no longer be allowed to dress up as &#x27;Indians&#x27; and incorporate Native American motifs into two of the order&#x27;s more important ceremonies&quot;, according to the Voice of America, which noted also that &quot;in spite of complaints from tribes across the country, Scouts continue to dress in &#x27;Redface,&#x27; a term some use to describe the wearing of feathers and warpaint by non-Native Americans.&quot; In 2023, amid a backlash against stereotypes of Native Americans, the BSA held a survey among its members about whether to eliminate or alter the rituals, including those for the OA.

On December 23, 2023, the national Order of the Arrow leadership announced: &quot;American Indian Activities (dancing, drumming, and crafts) will not be a part of the program at the 2024 National OA Conference.&quot; And, &quot;There is not a single entity that speaks for the 574 federally recognized tribes/Indian nations across the United States and it is impossible for us to gain consensus amongst all the tribes/Indian nations. As a result, national-level American Indian programming is not appropriate.&quot;

In 2024, the organization announced that issuance of American Indian Vigil Honor names will stop. Native American-based competitions, training and other programs will be discontinued at the section and national level in 2025. The practice will remain open at the local level until January 1, 2026. At that time, &quot;only lodges that have a formal relationship established with a state or federally recognized tribe in their area may engage in American Indian programming.&quot; Additional guidance on this item was distributed in December 2024 and additional training will be issued throughout 2025.

==Recent Freemasonry debate==
As evident in the history of the Order of the Arrow, the organization started with a large influence of Freemasonry. In the 1930s, it underwent a replacement of the Masonic vocabulary to avoid offending religious groups, including the Catholic Church and some protestant denominations who have long-standing concerns with Freemasonry. Since then, the OA has grown to be an important part of the Boy Scouts of America throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. However, the debate about its relationship with Freemasonry is not over.

Those who put forward this idea believe that the Order of the Arrow is still today a Masonic organization and has not shed its Masonic nature. Several articles have been published since the 1990s expending on this idea. They point to the history of the OA and the current similarities that persist between Freemasonry and the present-day Order of the Arrow in its organization, secret ceremonies, and other rituals:
* &quot;Freemasonry, Scouting and the Order of the Arrow&quot; by S.M. Adkins with two follow-up articles titled &quot;Following Arrows&quot; and &quot;Yes, Virginia, it was called the &#x27;Blood Rite&quot;&#x27;.
* &quot;Freemasonry Has Infiltrated the Boy Scouts?&quot; by John Salza which provides a Catholic specific perspective
* &quot;The Order of the Arrow, Another Mason Ritual?&quot; by John R. Goodwin
* &quot;Scouting and Freemasons&quot; in Freemasons for Dummies by Christopher Hodapp

===OA acknowledges past Masonic influence===
The Order of the Arrow has not addressed directly the question of its present ties to Freemasonry. But on its official website, the OA does not shy away from its past by using the old Masonic terminology similar in a historical context and acknowledging that this terminology may well have come from the Masonic fraternal system:
&quot;In 1921 Wimachtendienk, W.W. (a common way at the time of referring to what we know as the Order of the Arrow) was ready to have a national structure. Patterned similar to the Freemasons, it was decided that each lodge would become a member of the Grand Lodge.&quot;

&quot;The usage of the term “Grand Lodge” appears to have come from the Masonic fraternal system that also calls their national organization a The Grand Lodge.&quot;

It also acknowledges that it was required to change this terminology in the 1930s:
&quot;As part of the agreement made by the OA National Executive Committee with the BSA to become an official part of the Boy Scout program the OA agreed to change certain terminology effective January 1, 1935 (although not disseminated to local lodges until April 23, 1935). The BSA was concerned about heavy reliance on Masonic fraternal terms in the Order. So the term “lodge” which is what Masons call their local groupings was replaced with the word “tribe”. Instead of Unami Lodge and Owasippe Lodge, they became Unami Tribe and Owasippe Tribe. Likewise the Masons use of the term “Grand” to describe their highest governing body was changed to “National”. Thus the OA’s Grand Lodge would become known as the National Tribe and the Grand Chieftain would become known as the National Chieftain. Similarly, the term “Degree” became “Honor” and the term “Password” became “Admonition”. The term “Manitou” referring to a deity was completely eliminated from ceremonies, this being done to satisfy religious groups concerns.&quot;

===Addressing concerns from adults===
The OA also recognizes and respects the right of any parent, Scout leader and religious leader to have questions about the OA and its safeguarded ceremonies prior to a scout joining the organization. It provides a formal process to answer these questions with the lodge adviser or his designee. If questions remain after this meeting, the adults will be permitted to read the current ceremony text used in the Ordeal to make an informed decision. As scouts are minors, parents have the final say to allow or disallow their child to join the organization. Some exceptions can also be granted to allow parents to attend the ceremony itself under certain conditions.

==Criticism of election procedures==
Elections to the Order of the Arrow have sparked controversy as being little more than popularity contests, especially in troops where Scouts attend the same schools and are friends outside of the troop. As such, deserving Scouts who are not popular among their troop mates frequently remain excluded from the Order of the Arrow. In larger troops, the election of younger Scouts almost never occurs since older Scouts dominate the troop leadership and will frequently only elect their peers rather than Scouts who are several years younger. The Chairman of the Order of the Arrow acknowledged in 2011 that elections were a challenge, and that steps had been taken for adult leaders to make a greater effort to convey the serious nature of Order of the Arrow membership to members of the troop.

===Old concerns===
This concern about Fraternities being cliques and excluding some had already been brought up back in 1922 before the Order of the Arrow was even part of Boy Scouts of America. During the Second Biennial Conference of the Boy Scout Executives in the debate about secrets societies within BSA camps by Dr. Tinney of Little Rock, AR stated this:
During this same conference, E. Urner Goodman had defended Camp Fraternities and opposed a possible blanket ban on these. The Order of the Arrow would end up becoming an &quot;Official Experiment&quot; at the same conference.

===Today===
Today, the Order of the Arrow provides guidance to OA leaders in an effort to mitigate this issue. The OA &quot;Unit Election Handbook&quot; covers this in their Frequently Asked Questions:
OA Representatives organizing the elections are requested to read the following statement to the troop:

<text>In statistics, multistage sampling is the taking of samples in stages using smaller and smaller sampling units at each stage.

Multistage sampling can be a complex form of cluster sampling because it is a type of sampling which involves dividing the population into groups (or clusters). Then, one or more clusters are chosen at random and everyone within the chosen cluster is sampled.

Using all the sample elements in all the selected clusters may be prohibitively expensive or unnecessary. Under these circumstances, multistage cluster sampling becomes useful. Instead of using all the elements contained in the selected clusters, the researcher randomly selects elements from each cluster. Constructing the clusters is the first stage. Deciding what elements within the cluster to use is the second stage. The technique is used frequently when a complete list of all members of the population does not exist and is inappropriate.

In some cases, several levels of cluster selection may be applied before the final sample elements are reached. For example, household surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics begin by dividing metropolitan regions into &#x27;collection districts&#x27; and selecting some of these collection districts (first stage). The selected collection districts are then divided into blocks, and blocks are chosen from within each selected collection district (second stage). Next, dwellings are listed within each selected block, and some of these dwellings are selected (third stage). This method makes it unnecessary to create a list of every dwelling in the region and necessary only for selected blocks. In remote areas, an additional stage of clustering is used, in order to reduce travel requirements.

Although cluster sampling and stratified sampling bear some superficial similarities, they are substantially different. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from all the strata, where in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are studied, either in single- or multi-stage.

Advantages 
* Cost and speed that the survey can be done in
* Convenience of finding the survey sample
* Normally more accurate than cluster sampling for the same size sample

Disadvantages
* Not as accurate as Simple Random Sample if the sample is the same size
* More testing is difficult to do

<doc id="76560" wikidata="Q315202" url="?curid=76560" title="Roscoe Arbuckle">
<text>Roscoe Conkling &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle (; March 24, 1887 – June 29, 1933) was an American silent film actor, director, and screenwriter. He started at the Selig Polyscope Company and eventually moved to Keystone Studios, where he worked with Mabel Normand and Harold Lloyd as well as with his nephew, Al St. John. He also mentored Charlie Chaplin, Monty Banks and Bob Hope, and brought vaudeville star Buster Keaton into the movie business. Arbuckle was one of the most popular silent stars of the 1910s and one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, signing a contract in 1920 with Paramount Pictures for $1,000,000 a year (equivalent to $ million in ).

Arbuckle was the defendant in three widely publicized trials between November 1921 and April 1922 for the rape and manslaughter of actress Virginia Rappe. Rappe had fallen ill at a party hosted by Arbuckle at San Francisco&#x27;s St. Francis Hotel in September 1921, and died four days later. A friend of Rappe accused Arbuckle of raping and accidentally killing her. The first two trials resulted in hung juries, but the third trial acquitted Arbuckle. The third jury took the unusual step of giving Arbuckle a written statement of apology for his treatment by the justice system.

Despite Arbuckle&#x27;s acquittal, the scandal has mostly overshadowed his legacy as a pioneering comedian. At the behest of Adolph Zukor, president of Famous Players–Lasky, his films were banned by motion picture industry censor Will H. Hays after the trial, and he was publicly ostracized. Zukor was faced with the moral outrage of various groups such as the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance, the powerful Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs and even the Federal Trade Commission to curb what they perceived as Hollywood debauchery run amok and its effect on the morals of the general public. While Arbuckle saw a resurgence in his popularity immediately after his acquittal, Zukor decided he had to be sacrificed to keep the movie industry out of the clutches of censors and moralists. Hays lifted the ban within a year, but Arbuckle only worked sparingly through the 1920s. In their deal, Keaton promised to give him 35% of the Buster Keaton Comedies Co. profits. He later worked as a film director under the pseudonym William Goodrich. He was finally able to return to acting, making short two-reel comedies in 1932–33 for Warner Bros.

Arbuckle died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1933 at age 46, reportedly on the day that he signed a contract with Warner Bros. to make a feature film.

==Early life==
Roscoe Arbuckle was born on March 24, 1887, in Smith Center, Kansas, one of nine children of Mary E. Gordon and William Goodrich Arbuckle. He weighed in excess of at birth and his father believed that he was illegitimate, as both parents had slim builds. Consequently, he named him after Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, a notorious philanderer whom he despised. The birth was traumatic for Mary and resulted in chronic health problems that contributed to her death eleven years later.

Arbuckle was nearly two when his family moved to Santa Ana, California. He first performed on stage with Frank Bacon&#x27;s company at age 8 during their performance in Santa Ana. Arbuckle enjoyed performing and continued on until his mother&#x27;s death in 1898, when he was 11. Arbuckle&#x27;s father had always treated him harshly and now refused to support him, so he got work doing odd jobs in a hotel. He was in the habit of singing while he worked, and a professional singer heard him and invited him to perform in an amateur talent show. The show consisted of the audience judging acts by clapping or jeering, with bad acts pulled off the stage by a shepherd&#x27;s crook. Arbuckle sang, danced, and did some clowning around, but he did not impress the audience. He saw the crook emerging from the wings and somersaulted into the orchestra pit in obvious panic. The audience went wild, and he won the competition and began a career in vaudeville.

==Career==

In 1904, Sid Grauman invited Arbuckle to sing in his new Unique Theater in San Francisco, beginning a long friendship between the two. He then joined the Pantages Theatre Group touring the West Coast and in 1906 played the Orpheum Theater in Portland, Oregon, in a vaudeville troupe organized by Leon Errol. Arbuckle became the main act and the group took their show on tour.

On August 6, 1908, Arbuckle married Minta Durfee (1889–1975), the daughter of Charles Warren Durfee and Flora Adkins. Durfee starred in many early comedy films, often with Arbuckle. As a couple, they appeared mismatched, as Minta was short and petite while Arbuckle tipped the scales at 300 lbs (136 kg). Arbuckle then joined the Morosco Burbank Stock vaudeville company and went on a tour of China and Japan, returning in early 1909.

Arbuckle began his film career with the Selig Polyscope Company in July 1909 when he appeared in &quot;Ben&#x27;s Kid&quot;. He appeared sporadically in Selig one-reelers until 1913, moved briefly to Universal Pictures, and became a star in producer-director Mack Sennett&#x27;s &quot;Keystone Cops&quot; comedies. Although his large size was undoubtedly part of his comedic appeal, Arbuckle was self-conscious about his weight and refused to use it to get &quot;cheap&quot; laughs like getting stuck in a doorway or chair.

Arbuckle was a talented singer. After famed operatic tenor Enrico Caruso heard him sing, he urged the comedian to &quot;give up this nonsense you do for a living, with training you could become the second greatest singer in the world.&quot;

==Screen comedian==
Despite his physical size, Arbuckle was remarkably agile and acrobatic. Mack Sennett, when recounting his first meeting with Arbuckle, noted that he &quot;skipped up the stairs as lightly as Fred Astaire&quot; and that he &quot;without warning went into a feather light step, clapped his hands and did a backward somersault as graceful as a girl tumbler&quot;. His comedies are noted as rollicking and fast-paced, have many chase scenes, and feature sight gags. Arbuckle was fond of the &quot;pie in the face&quot;, a comedy cliché that has come to symbolize silent-film-era comedy itself. The earliest known pie thrown in film was in the June 1913 Keystone one-reeler &quot;A Noise from the Deep&quot;, starring Arbuckle and frequent screen partner Mabel Normand.

In 1914, Paramount Pictures made the then unheard-of offer of US$1,000 a day plus twenty-five percent of all profits and complete artistic control to make movies with Arbuckle and Normand. The movies were so lucrative and popular that in 1918 they offered Arbuckle a three-year, $3 million contract (equivalent to $ million in ).

By 1916, Arbuckle was experiencing serious health problems. An infection that developed on his leg became a carbuncle so severe that doctors considered amputation. Although Arbuckle was able to keep his leg, he was prescribed morphine against the pain; he would later be accused of being addicted to it. Following his recovery, Arbuckle started his own film company, Comique, in partnership with Joseph Schenck. Although Comique produced some of the best short pictures of the silent era, Arbuckle transferred his controlling interest in the company to Buster Keaton in 1918 and accepted Paramount&#x27;s $3 million offer to make up to 18 feature films over three years.

Arbuckle disliked his screen nickname. &quot;Fatty&quot; had also been Arbuckle&#x27;s nickname since school; &quot;It was inevitable&quot;, he said. Fans also called Roscoe &quot;The Prince of Whales&quot; and &quot;The Balloonatic&quot;. However, the name &quot;Fatty&quot; identifies the character that Arbuckle portrayed on-screen (usually a naive hayseed), not Arbuckle himself. When Arbuckle portrayed a female, the character was named &quot;Miss Fatty&quot;, as in the film &quot;Miss Fatty&#x27;s Seaside Lovers&quot;. Arbuckle discouraged anyone from addressing him as &quot;Fatty&quot; off-screen, and when they did so his usual response was, &quot;I&#x27;ve got a name, you know.&quot;

==Scandal==

On Monday, September 5, 1921 (Labor Day), Arbuckle took a break from his hectic film schedule and, despite suffering second-degree burns to both buttocks from an on-set accident, drove to San Francisco with two friends, Lowell Sherman and Fred Fishback. The three checked into three rooms at the St. Francis Hotel: 1219 for Arbuckle and Fishback to share, 1221 for Sherman, and 1220 designated as a party room. Several women were invited to the suite. During the carousing, a 30-year-old aspiring actress named Virginia Rappe was found seriously ill in room 1219 and was examined by the hotel doctor, who concluded that her symptoms were mostly caused by intoxication and administered morphine to calm her. Rappe was not hospitalized until two days after the incident.
At the hospital, Rappe&#x27;s companion at the party, Bambina Maude Delmont, told a doctor that Arbuckle had raped Rappe. The doctor examined Rappe but found no evidence of rape. She died Friday, September 9, 1921 from peritonitis caused by a ruptured bladder. Rappe suffered from chronic urinary tract infections, a condition that liquor irritated dramatically. 

The day after Rappe&#x27;s death, Arbuckle was arrested and arraigned on charges of murder and held without bail. A grand jury also indicted him on manslaughter of the first degree on September 13, 1921. 

Delmont told police that Arbuckle had raped Rappe. The police concluded that the impact of Arbuckle&#x27;s overweight body on top of Rappe caused her bladder to rupture. At a press conference, Rappe&#x27;s manager, Al Semnacher, accused Arbuckle of using a piece of ice to simulate sex with Rappe that led to her injuries. By the time that the story was reported in newspapers, the object had evolved into a Coca-Cola or champagne bottle rather than a piece of ice. In fact, witnesses testified that Arbuckle rubbed the ice on Rappe&#x27;s stomach to ease her abdominal pain. Arbuckle denied any wrongdoing. Delmont later admitted to plotting to extort money from him.

Arbuckle was regarded by those who knew him closely as a good-natured man who was shy around women, and he had been described as &quot;the most chaste man in pictures.&quot; However, studio executives, fearing negative publicity by association, warned Arbuckle&#x27;s industry friends and fellow actors (many of whose careers they controlled) not to publicly defend him. Charlie Chaplin told reporters that he could not believe that Arbuckle was guilty, having known him since they both worked at Keystone in 1914. Chaplin &quot;knew Roscoe to be a genial, easy-going type who would not harm a fly.&quot; Buster Keaton issued a public statement in support of Arbuckle that resulted in a mild reprimand from Keaton&#x27;s studio. Actor William S. Hart, who had never met or worked with Arbuckle, issued a number of damaging public statements presuming Arbuckle&#x27;s guilt. Arbuckle later wrote a premise for a film parodying Hart as a thief, bully and wifebeater. Keaton purchased the premise, and the resulting film, &quot;The Frozen North&quot;, was released in 1922, almost a year after the scandal first emerged. Keaton cowrote, directed and starred in the film, and Hart refused to speak to Keaton for many years afterward.

The prosecutor, San Francisco district attorney Matthew Brady, an intensely ambitious man who planned to run for governor, made public pronouncements of Arbuckle&#x27;s guilt and pressured witnesses to make false statements. Brady at first featured Delmont as his star witness during the indictment hearing. The defense obtained a letter from Delmont admitting to a plan to extort payment from Arbuckle. Delmont&#x27;s constantly changing testimony effectively ended any chance of the case proceeding to trial. Ultimately, the judge found no evidence of rape. After hearing testimony from party guest Zey Prevon that Rappe said &quot;Roscoe hurt me&quot; on her deathbed, the judge decided that Arbuckle could be charged with first-degree murder. Brady had originally planned to seek the death penalty, but the charge was later reduced to manslaughter.

After nearly three weeks in jail he was released on bail of $5,000. 

===Trials===
Arbuckle&#x27;s trial was a major media event. The story was fueled by yellow journalism, with many newspapers portraying Arbuckle as a gross lecher who used his weight to overpower innocent girls. William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s nationwide newspaper chain exploited the situation with exaggerated and sensationalized stories. Hearst was gratified by the profits that he accrued during the Arbuckle scandal, and he allegedly said that it had &quot;sold more newspapers [...] than when the &quot;Lusitania&quot; went down.&quot; Morality groups called for Arbuckle to be sentenced to death.

====First trial====

The trial began on November 14, 1921 in the San Francisco city courthouse. Arbuckle hired as his lead defense counsel Gavin McNab, a competent local attorney. The principal witness was Prevon. At the beginning of the trial, Arbuckle told his estranged wife Minta Durfee that he had not harmed Rappe. Durfee believed him and appeared regularly in the courtroom to support him. Public feeling was so negative that shots were fired at Durfee as she entered the courthouse.

Brady&#x27;s first witnesses during the trial included model Betty Campbell, who attended the party and testified that she saw Arbuckle with a smile on his face hours after the alleged rape occurred. Another witness, hospital nurse Grace Hultson, testified that it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process. Criminologist Dr. Edward Heinrich testified that fingerprints on the hallway door proved that Rappe had tried to flee, but that Arbuckle had stopped her by placing his hand over hers. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. However, during cross-examination, Campbell revealed that Brady had threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich&#x27;s claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced a maid from the St. Francis Hotel who testified that she had thoroughly cleaned the room before the investigation took place. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab coaxed Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe&#x27;s bladder could have been the result of cancer and that the bruises could have been caused by the heavy jewelry that Rappe was wearing that evening.

On November 28, Arbuckle testified as the defense&#x27;s final witness and was reported to be simple, direct and unflustered under both direct and cross-examination. In his testimony, Arbuckle claimed that Rappe (whom he testified to have known for five or six years) entered the party room (1220) around noon that day, and that sometime afterward he retreated to his room (1219) to change clothes after Mae Taub, daughter-in-law of Billy Sunday, asked him for a ride into town. In his room, Arbuckle discovered Rappe in the bathroom vomiting into the toilet. He claimed that Rappe had told him that she felt ill and asked to lie down, and that he carried her into the bedroom and asked a few of the party guests to help treat her. When Arbuckle and a few of the guests entered the room again, they found Rappe on the floor near the bed tearing at her clothing and experiencing violent convulsions. To calm Rappe, they placed her in a bathtub of cool water. Arbuckle and Fischbach then took her to room 1227 and called the hotel manager and doctor. At this point all those present believed that Rappe was just very drunk, including the hotel doctors. Assuming that Rappe&#x27;s condition would improve if she slept, Arbuckle drove Taub into town.

The prosecution presented medical descriptions of Rappe&#x27;s bladder as evidence that she had suffered from an illness. In his testimony, Arbuckle denied that he had any knowledge of Rappe&#x27;s illness. During cross-examination, assistant district attorney Leo Friedman aggressively grilled Arbuckle about Arbuckle&#x27;s refusal to call a doctor when he found Rappe sick and argued that Arbuckle had refused because he knew of Rappe&#x27;s illness and saw a perfect opportunity to rape and kill her. Arbuckle calmly maintained that he did not physically hurt or sexually assault Rappe during the party, and he also stated that he had never made any inappropriate sexual advances against any woman in his life. After more than two weeks of testimony with 60 prosecution and defense witnesses, including 18 doctors who testified about Rappe&#x27;s illness, the defense rested. On December 4, 1921, the jury returned five days later deadlocked after nearly 44 hours of deliberation with a 10–2 not-guilty verdict, and a mistrial was declared.

Arbuckle&#x27;s attorneys later concentrated on juror Helen Hubbard, who had told other jurors that she would vote guilty &quot;until hell freezes over.&quot; She had refused to examine the exhibits or read the trial transcripts, having already decided on Arbuckle&#x27;s guilt in the courtroom. Hubbard&#x27;s husband was a lawyer with connections to the district attorney&#x27;s office, and he expressed surprise that she was not challenged during the &quot;voir dire&quot; process. Some of the jurors revealed that they believed Arbuckle to be guilty, but not beyond a reasonable doubt. During the deliberations, some jurors joined Hubbard in voting to convict, but all but one eventually changed their vote. Researcher Joan Myers suggests that Arbuckle&#x27;s defense team targeted Hubbard as a villain because there had been a great deal of media attention on women serving in juries, a practice that had been legalized only four years earlier. Myers also records Hubbard&#x27;s account of the jury foreman&#x27;s attempts to pressure her to change her vote. While Hubbard offered explanations on her vote whenever challenged, Thomas Kilkenny, the other juror who voted guilty, remained silent and quickly faded from the media spotlight after the trial ended.

====Second trial====
The second trial began on January 11, 1922 with a new jury but with the same legal defense, prosecution and presiding judge as those of the previous trial. The same evidence was presented, but this time, witness Zey Prevon testified that Brady had forced her to lie. Another witness who testified during the first trial, a former studio security guard named Jesse Norgard, testified that Arbuckle had once offered him a cash bribe in exchange for the key to Rappe&#x27;s dressing room but that Norgard refused. Norgard claimed that Arbuckle stated that he wanted the key to play a joke on Rappe. During cross-examination, Norgard&#x27;s testimony was impugned when he was revealed to be an ex-convict under indictment for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl, and was seeking a sentence reduction from Brady in exchange for his testimony. In contrast to the first trial, Rappe&#x27;s history of promiscuity and heavy drinking was detailed. The second trial also discredited some major evidence such as the identification of Arbuckle&#x27;s fingerprints on the hotel bedroom door. Heinrich disowned his testimony from the first trial and stated that the fingerprint evidence was likely faked. The defense was so confident that Arbuckle would be acquitted that they did not call him to testify, and McNab did not deliver a closing argument to the jury. However, some jurors interpreted the refusal to permit Arbuckle to testify as a sign of guilt. After five days and more than 40 hours of deliberation, the jury returned on February 3, deadlocked with a 10–2 majority in favor of conviction, resulting in another mistrial.

====Third trial====

By the time of Arbuckle&#x27;s third trial, his films had been banned and newspapers had been filled for the past seven months with stories of Hollywood orgies, murder and sexual perversion. Delmont was touring the country performing one-woman shows based on her involvement with the case and lecturing on the evils of Hollywood.

The third trial began on March 13, 1922, and McNab took a forceful approach, attacking the prosecution&#x27;s case with long and aggressive examination and cross-examination of each witness. McNab also introduced more evidence about Rappe&#x27;s lurid past and medical history. The prosecution&#x27;s case was weakened because Prevon, a key witness, was out of the country after fleeing police custody and unable to testify. As in the first trial, Arbuckle testified as the final witness and maintained his denial of any wrongdoing. During closing statements, McNab reviewed the flaws in the case and attacked Brady for believing Delmont&#x27;s outlandish charges, a woman whom McNab described as &quot;the complaining witness who never witnessed.&quot; The jury began deliberations April 12 and took only six minutes to return with a unanimous not-guilty verdict. Five of those minutes were spent writing a formal statement of apology to Arbuckle for subjecting him to the ordeal, a dramatic and unusual gesture. The jury statement read:

Some experts later concluded that Rappe&#x27;s bladder may have ruptured as a result of an abortion procedure that she may have undergone shortly before the party. However, her organs had been destroyed and it was now impossible to test her for pregnancy. Because alcohol was consumed at the party, Arbuckle pled guilty to one count of violating the Volstead Act and was ordered to pay a $500 fine (). At the time of his acquittal, he owed more than $700,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in legal fees to his attorneys for the three criminal trials, and he was forced to sell his house and all of his cars to pay some of the debt.

===Aftermath===

Following Arbuckle&#x27;s arrest, hundreds of exhibitors withdrew his films from distribution.

The scandal and trials greatly damaged Arbuckle&#x27;s popularity among the general public. In spite of the acquittal and the apology, his reputation was not restored and the effects of the scandal continued. Will H. Hays, who served as the head of the newly formed Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors of America censor board, cited Arbuckle as an example of Hollywood&#x27;s poor morals. On April 18, 1922, six days after Arbuckle&#x27;s acquittal, Hays issued a lifetime ban that would prohibit Arbuckle from film work. Hays also requested that all showings and bookings of Arbuckle&#x27;s films be canceled, and exhibitors complied. In December of the same year, under public pressure, Hays rescinded the ban. However, Arbuckle remained unable to secure work as an actor.

Most exhibitors still declined to show Arbuckle&#x27;s films, several of which are now considered lost. Paramount withdrew his latest film &quot;Crazy to Marry&quot; after only a brief release, and shelved two features he had already completed: &quot;Leap Year&quot; and &quot;The Fast Freight&quot;. The latter films were ultimately released only in Europe, far away from the scandalmongers in America, and recouped at least part of their production costs. In March 1922, with Arbuckle&#x27;s films banned, Buster Keaton signed an agreement to award Arbuckle 35% of all future profits from his production company Buster Keaton Comedies, hoping to ease Arbuckle&#x27;s financial situation.

In November 1923, Minta Durfee filed for divorce from Arbuckle, charging grounds of desertion. The divorce was granted the following January. They had been amicably separated since 1921. After a brief reconciliation, Durfee again filed for divorce in December 1924. Arbuckle married Doris Deane on May 16, 1925.

Arbuckle tried returning to filmmaking, but industry resistance to distributing his films continued to linger after his acquittal. He retreated into alcoholism. In the words of his first wife, &quot;Roscoe only seemed to find solace and comfort in a bottle&quot;. Keaton attempted to help Arbuckle by employing him for his films. Arbuckle wrote the story for a Keaton short titled &quot;Day Dreams&quot; (1922) and allegedly directed scenes in Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot; (1924), but it is unclear how much of Arbuckle&#x27;s footage remained in the film&#x27;s final cut. In 1925, Carter DeHaven&#x27;s short &quot;Character Studies&quot;, filmed before the scandal, was released, featuring Arbuckle along with Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks and Jackie Coogan. The same year in &quot;Photoplay&quot;″s August issue, James R. Quirk wrote: &quot;I would like to see Roscoe Arbuckle make a comeback to the screen. ... The American nation prides itself upon its spirit of fair play. We like the whole world to look upon America as the place where every man gets a square deal. Are you sure Roscoe Arbuckle is getting one today? I&#x27;m not.&quot;

==William Goodrich pseudonym==
Eventually, Arbuckle worked as a director under the pseudonym of William Goodrich, his father&#x27;s first and middle name. Keaton, a frequent punster, later claimed that the name was derived from the satirical alias &quot;Will B. Good&quot;.

Between 1924 and 1932, Arbuckle directed a number of comedy shorts under the pseudonym for Educational Pictures that featured lesser-known comics of the day. Louise Brooks, who played the ingenue in &quot;Windy Riley Goes Hollywood&quot; (1931), told of her experiences working with Arbuckle:

He made no attempt to direct this picture. He just sat in his director&#x27;s chair like a dead man. He had been very nice and sweetly dead ever since the scandal that ruined his career. But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He was a wonderful dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.

Among the more visible directorial projects under the Goodrich pseudonym was the Eddie Cantor feature &quot;Special Delivery&quot; (1927), which was released by Paramount and costarred William Powell and Jobyna Ralston. His highest-profile project was arguably &quot;The Red Mill&quot;, also released in 1927, a Marion Davies vehicle. In 1930 he served as an uncredited gag writer for the Wheeler and Woolsey military comedy &quot;Half Shot at Sunrise&quot;.

== Roscoe Arbuckle&#x27;s Plantation Café ==
Arbuckle and Dan Coombs, one of Culver City&#x27;s first mayors, reopened the Plantation Club near the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios on Washington Boulevard as Roscoe Arbuckle&#x27;s Plantation Café on August 2, 1928. By 1930, Arbuckle sold his interest and it became known as George Olsen&#x27;s Plantation Café, later the Plantation Trailer Court and then Foreman Phillips County Barn Dance.

==Second divorce and third marriage==
In 1929, Doris Deane sued for divorce from Arbuckle in Los Angeles, charging desertion and cruelty. On June 21, 1932, Roscoe married Addie Oakley Dukes McPhail (later Addie Oakley Sheldon, 1905–2003) in Erie, Pennsylvania.

==Brief comeback and death==
In 1932, Arbuckle signed a contract with Warner Bros. to star under his own name in a series of six two-reel comedies to be filmed at the Vitaphone studios in Brooklyn, New York. These six short films constitute the only samples of Arbuckle&#x27;s voice, which recorded in a pleasant second-tenor range. Silent-film comedian Al St. John (Arbuckle&#x27;s nephew) and actors Lionel Stander and Shemp Howard appeared with Arbuckle. The film &quot;How&#x27;ve You Bean?&quot; features grocery-store gags reminiscent of Arbuckle&#x27;s 1917 short &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;, with vaudeville comic Fritz Hubert as his assistant, dressed like Buster Keaton. The Vitaphone shorts were very successful in the U.S., although when Warner Bros. attempted to release the first one (&quot;Hey, Pop!&quot;) in the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Censors cited the ten-year-old scandal and refused to grant an exhibition certificate.

On June 28, 1933, Arbuckle had finished filming &quot;In the Dough&quot;, the last of the Vitaphone two-reelers (four of which had already been released). The next day, he signed a contract with Warner Bros. to star in a feature-length film. That night, he met with friends to celebrate his first wedding anniversary and the new contract when he reportedly said: &quot;This is the best day of my life.&quot; He suffered a heart attack later that night and died in his sleep at the age of 46. His widow Addie requested that his body be cremated according to Arbuckle&#x27;s wish.

Many of Arbuckle&#x27;s films, including the feature &quot;The Life of the Party&quot; (1920), survive only as worn prints with foreign-language intertitles. As with most American films produced during the silent era, little or no effort was made to preserve original negatives and prints during Hollywood&#x27;s first two decades, making most films that included him lost media or lost films. However, it is likely that due to the reputation Arbuckle received around the death of Virginia Rappe, that many studios wished to avoid any negative backlash and purposely destroyed any surviving films in which he had a starring role.

By the early 21st century, some of Arbuckle&#x27;s short subjects (particularly those co-starring Chaplin or Keaton) had been restored, released on DVD, and even screened theatrically. His early influence on American slapstick comedy is widely recognized.

For his contributions to the film industry, in 1960, some 27 years after his death, Arbuckle was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6701 Hollywood Boulevard.

==In popular culture==

Neil Sedaka refers to Arbuckle, along with Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Stan Laurel, and Oliver Hardy in his 1971 song &quot;Silent Movies&quot;, as heard on his &quot;Emergence&quot; album.

The James Ivory film &quot;The Wild Party&quot; (1975) has been repeatedly but incorrectly cited as a film dramatization of the Arbuckle–Rappe scandal. In fact it is loosely based on the 1926 poem by Joseph Moncure March. In this film, James Coco portrays a heavy-set silent film comedian named Jolly Grimm whose career is on the skids, but who is desperately planning a comeback. Raquel Welch portrays his mistress, who ultimately goads him into shooting her. This film was loosely based on the misconceptions surrounding the Arbuckle scandal, yet it bears almost no resemblance to the documented facts of the case.

In Ken Russell&#x27;s 1977 biopic &quot;Valentino&quot;, Rudolph Nureyev as a pre-movie star Rudolph Valentino dances in a nightclub before a grossly overweight, obnoxious, and hedonistic celebrity called &quot;Mr. Fatty&quot; (played by William Hootkins), a caricature of Arbuckle rooted in the public view of him created in popular press coverage of the Rappe rape trial. In the scene, Valentino picks up starlet Jean Acker (played by Carol Kane) off a table in which she is sitting in front of Fatty and dances with her, enraging the spoiled star, who becomes apoplectic. 

Australian band The Fauves&#x27;s 1993 debut album &quot;Drive Through Charisma&quot; ends with a song called &quot;Arbuckle at Glenrowan&quot;, which imagines Arbuckle visiting the town of Glenrowan, Victoria where bushranger Ned Kelly was captured in the year 1880.

Before his death in 1997, comedian Chris Farley expressed interest in starring as Arbuckle in a biography film. According to the 2008 biography &quot;The Chris Farley Show: A Biography in Three Acts&quot;, Farley and screenwriter David Mamet agreed to work together on what would have been Farley&#x27;s first dramatic role. In 2007, director Kevin Connor planned a film, &quot;The Life of the Party&quot;, based on Arbuckle&#x27;s life. It was to star Chris Kattan and Preston Lacy. However, the project was shelved. Like Farley, comedians John Belushi and John Candy also considered playing Arbuckle, but each of them died before a biopic was made. Farley&#x27;s film was signed with Vince Vaughn as his co-star.

In April and May 2006, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a 56-film, month-long retrospective of all of Arbuckle&#x27;s known surviving work, running the entire series twice.

Arbuckle is the subject of a 2004 novel titled &quot;I, Fatty&quot; by author Jerry Stahl. &quot;The Day the Laughter Stopped&quot; by David Yallop and &quot;Frame-Up! The Untold Story of Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle&quot; by Andy Edmonds are other books on Arbuckle&#x27;s life. The 1963 novel &quot;Scandal in Eden&quot; by Garet Rogers is a fictionalized version of the Arbuckle scandal.

Fatty Arbuckle&#x27;s was an American-themed restaurant chain in the UK named after Arbuckle.

The 2009 novel &quot;Devil&#x27;s Garden&quot; is based on the Arbuckle trials. The main character in the story is Dashiell Hammett, a Pinkerton detective in San Francisco at the time of the trials.

NOFX&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Self Entitled&quot; has a song called &quot;I, Fatty&quot; about Arbuckle.

The 2021 French graphic novel &quot;Fatty : le premier roi d&#x27;Hollywood&quot;, by Nadar and Julien Frey, portrays the period from Arbuckle&#x27;s early days in Hollywood to his death.

The character Orville Pickwick is based on Arbuckle in Damien Chazelle&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;Babylon&quot;, played by Troy Metcalf. 

In &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;&#x27;s Season 12 Episode 8, &quot;The Colostomy Bag,&quot; Larry David in discussion with Conan O&#x27;Brien claims that Arbuckle attacked a stranger with a beer bottle after being spoken to in public.

During the third season of &quot;Hacks&quot;, a biopic about Arbuckle becomes a central part of the plot starting with episode 7, &quot;The Deborah Vance Christmas Spectacular.&quot; In the episode, Christopher Lloyd plays a fictional grandson of Arbuckle&#x27;s (in real life Arbuckle had no children).

<doc id="76563" wikidata="Q36217" url="?curid=76563" title="Lingala">
<text>Lingala (or Ngala, Lingala: ) is a Bantu language spoken in the northwest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the northern half of the Republic of the Congo, in their capitals, Kinshasa and Brazzaville, and to a lesser degree as a trade language or because of emigration in neighbouring Angola or Central African Republic. Lingala has 20 million native speakers and about another 20 million second-language speakers, for an approximate total of 40 million speakers. A significant portion of both Congolese diasporas speaks Lingala in their countries of immigration like Belgium, France or the United States.

==History==
Before 1880, Bobangi was an important trade language on the western sections of the Congo River, between Stanley Pool (Kinshasa) and the confluence of the Congo and Ubangi rivers (Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of Congo). When the first Europeans and their West- and East-African troops started founding state posts for the Belgian king along this river section in the early 1880s, they noticed the widespread use and prestige of Bobangi. They attempted to learn it, but only cared to acquire an imperfect knowledge of it, a process that gave rise to a new, strongly restructured variety, called &quot;the trade language&quot;, &quot;the language of the river&quot;, or &quot;Bobangi-pidgin&quot;, among other names. In 1884, Europeans introduced this restructured variety of Bobangi in the state post Bangala Station to communicate with local Congolese, some of whom had second-language knowledge of original Bobangi, and with the Congolese from more remote areas whom missionaries and colonials had been relocating to the station by force. The &quot;language of the river&quot; was therefore soon renamed &quot;Bangala&quot;, a label the Europeans had since 1876 also been using as a convenient, but erroneous and non-original ethnic name for all Congolese of that region.

Around 1901–2, CICM missionaries started a project to &quot;purify&quot; the &quot;Bangala&quot; language by cleansing it from the &quot;impure&quot;, pidginlike features it had acquired when it emerged out of Bobangi in the early 1880s.

Around and shortly after 1901, a number of both Catholic and Protestant missionaries working in the western and northern Congo Free State, independently of one another but in strikingly parallel terms, judged that Bangala as it had developed out of Bobangi was too &quot;pidgin like&quot;, &quot;too poor&quot; a language to function as a proper means of education and evangelization. Each of them set out on a program of massive corpus planning, aimed at actively &quot;correcting&quot; and &quot;enlarging&quot; Bangala from above [...]. One of them was the Catholic missionary Egide De Boeck of the Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae (CICM, commonly known as &quot;the Missionaries of Scheut&quot; or &quot;Scheutists&quot;), who arrived in Bangala Station – Nouvelle Anvers in 1901. Another one was the Protestant missionary Walter H. Stapleton [...], and a third one the Catholic Léon Derikx of the Premonstratensian Fathers [...]. By 1915, De Boeck&#x27;s endeavors had proven to be more influential than Stapleton&#x27;s, whose language creative suggestions, as the Protestant missionaries&#x27; conference of 1911 admitted, had never been truly implemented [...]. Under the dominance of De Boeck&#x27;s work, Derikx&#x27;s discontinued his after less than 10 years.

Lingala&#x27;s importance as a vernacular has since grown with the size and importance of its main centers of use, Kinshasa and Brazzaville; with its use as the lingua franca of the armed forces; and with the popularity of soukous music.

== Name ==
At first the language the European pioneers and their African troops had forged out of Bobangi was called &quot;the river language&quot;, &quot;the trade language&quot;, and other volatile names. Beginning in 1884, it was called &quot;Bangala&quot;, due to its introduction in Bangala Station. After 1901, Catholic missionaries of CICM, also called the Congregation of Scheutists, proposed to rename the language &quot;Lingala&quot;. It took some decades for this to be generally accepted both by colonials and the Congolese. The name &quot;Lingala&quot; first appears in writing in a 1901-2 publication by the CICM missionary Égide De Boeck. This name change was accepted in western and northwestern Congo, and in other countries where the language was spoken, but not in northeastern Congo, where the variety of the language spoken locally is still called &quot;Bangala&quot;.

== Bobangi-Lingala relationship ==
Linguistically, Lingala is a dialect or variant of Bobangi, a popular or commercial Bobangi, that is, a Bobangi lingua franca spoken by non-native speakers. Lingala has also been referred to by the following names: &quot;bad Bobangi&quot;, &quot;Sabir of Bobangi&quot;, &quot;deformed and mixed Bobangi&quot;, &quot;Bobangi of treaties&quot;, &quot;patois of Bobangi and Kilolo&quot;, and &quot;the new language of the Bobangi&quot;.

== Characteristics and usage ==
Lingala is a Bantu-based creole of Central Africa with roots in the Bobangi language, which provided most of its lexicon and grammar. In its basic vocabulary, Lingala also borrows from other languages, such as Kikongo varieties, Ubangian languages, Swahili, French, Portuguese, English, and various African languages (note local and foreign interaction with Krumen).

In practice, the extent of borrowing varies widely with speakers of different regions (commonly among young people), and during different occasions.

French 
* &quot;momí&quot; comes from the old French &quot;ma mie&quot; (&quot;my dear&quot;), and can sound like it means &quot;grandmother&quot;, but means &quot;girlfriend&quot; 
* &quot;kelási&quot; for class/school

Spanish
* &quot;chiclé&quot; for chewing gum

Portuguese
* &quot;manteka&quot; for butter 
* &quot;mésa&quot; for table
* &quot;sapátu&quot; for shoes

English
* &quot;míliki&quot; for milk

* &quot;búku&quot; for book
* &quot;mótuka&quot;, from &quot;motor-car&quot;, for car

== Variation ==
The Lingala language can be divided into several regiolects and sociolects. The major regional varieties are northwestern Lingala, Kinshasa Lingala and Brazzaville Lingala.

Literary Lingala (&quot;lingala littéraire&quot; or &quot;lingala classique&quot; in French) is a standardized form used mostly in education and news broadcasts on state-owned radio or television and in Roman Catholic religious services, It is taught as a subject at some educational levels. It is historically associated with the work of the Catholic Church, the Belgian CICM missionaries in particular. It has a seven-vowel system () with an obligatory tense-lax vowel harmony. It also has a full range of morphological noun prefixes with mandatory grammatical agreement system with subject–verb, or noun–modifier for each of class. It is largely used in formal functions and in some forms of writing. Most native speakers of Spoken Lingala and Kinshasa Lingala consider it incomprehensible.

Northwestern (or &quot;Equateur&quot;) Lingala is the product of the (incomplete) internalization by Congolese of the prescriptive rules the CICM missionaries intended when designing Literary Lingala. The northwest is a zone where the CICM missionaries strongly supported the network of schools.
Spoken Lingala (called &quot;lingala parlé&quot; in French) is the variety mostly used in Lingalaphones&#x27; day-to-day lives. It has a full morphological noun prefix system, but the agreement system in the noun phrase is laxer than the literary variety&#x27;s. There is a five-vowel system and no vowel harmony. Spoken Lingala is largely used in informal functions, and the majority of Lingala songs use spoken Lingala. Modern spoken Lingala is influenced by French; French verbs, for example, may be &quot;lingalized&quot;, adding Lingala inflection prefixes and suffixes: &quot;acomprenaki te&quot; or &quot;acomprendraki te&quot; (&quot;he did not understand&quot;, using the French word &quot;comprendre&quot;) instead of classic Lingala &quot;asímbaki ntína te&quot; (literally: &quot;s/he grasped/held the root/cause not&quot;). These French influences are more prevalent in Kinshasa and indicate an erosion of the language as education in French becomes accessible to more of the population. There are pronunciation differences between &quot;Catholic Lingala&quot; and &quot;Protestant Lingala&quot;, for example nzala/njala (&quot;hunger&quot;).

&quot;Lingala ya Bayankee&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Yanké&quot;) is a sociolect widely used in Kinshasa, e.g., by street youth, street vendors, criminal gangs and homeless children. &quot;Langila&quot; is a little-studied language game (or ludic practice) musicians initially created shortly after 2000 that is increasingly used in social media and sites of cultural production.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===


====Vowel harmony====
Lingala words show vowel harmony to some extent. The close-mid vowels and normally do not mix with the open-mid vowels and in words. For example, the words &quot;ndɔbɔ&quot; &#x27;fishhook&#x27; and &quot;ndobo&quot; &#x27;mouse trap&#x27; are found, but not &quot;*ndɔbo&quot; or &quot;*ndobɔ&quot;.

====Vowel shift====
The Lingala spoken in Kinshasa shows a vowel shift from to , leading to the absence of the phoneme in favor of . The same occurs with and , leading to just . So in Kinshasa, a native speaker will say &quot;mbóte&quot; as , compared to the more traditional pronunciation, .

===Consonants===


====Prenasalized consonants====
The prenasalized stops formed with a nasal followed by a voiceless plosive are allophonic to the voiceless plosives alone in some variations of Lingala.
* : or 
*: e.g.: mpɛmbɛ́ni is pronounced but in some variations 
* : or 
*: e.g.: ntɔ́ngó is pronounced but in some variations 
* : or 
*: e.g.: nkanya (&quot;fork&quot;) is pronounced but in some variations 
* : or (inside a word)
*: e.g.: nyɔnsɔ is pronounced but in some variations 
The prenasalized voiced occlusives, , do not vary.

===Tones===
Lingala is a tonal language. Tone is a distinguishing feature in minimal pairs, e.g.: &quot;mutu&quot; (human being) and &quot;mutú&quot; (head), or kokoma (to write) and kokóma (to arrive). There are two main tones, low and high, and two less common ones: starting high, dipping low, and ending high, all within the same vowel sound, e.g., &quot;mǐso&quot; (eyes); and starting low, rising high, and ending low, e.g., &quot;bôngó&quot; (therefore).

====Tonal morphology====
Tense morphemes carry tones.

==Grammar==
===Noun class system===
Akin to all Bantu languages, Lingala has a noun class system in which nouns are classified according to the prefixes they bear and the prefixes they trigger in sentences. The table below shows Lingala&#x27;s noun classes ordered according to the numbering system widely used in descriptions of Bantu languages.

Individual classes pair up to form singular/plural pairs, sometimes called genders. There are seven genders. The singular classes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 take their plural forms from classes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, respectively. Additionally, many household items found in class 9 take a class 2 prefix (&quot;ba&quot;) in the plural: &quot;lútu&quot; → &quot;balútu&quot; &#x27;spoon&#x27;, &quot;mésa&quot; → &quot;bamésa&quot; &#x27;table&#x27;, &quot;sáni&quot; → &quot;basáni&quot; &#x27;plate&#x27;. Words in class 11 usually take a class 10 plural. Most words from class 14 (abstract nouns) do not have a plural counterpart.

Class 9 and 10 have a nasal prefix, which assimilates to the following consonant. Thus, the prefix shows up as &#x27;n&#x27; on words that start with &quot;t&quot; or &quot;d&quot;, e.g. &quot;ntaba&quot; &#x27;goat&#x27;, but as &#x27;m&#x27; on words that start with &quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot; (e.g. &quot;mbísi&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27;). There is also a prefixless class 9a and 10a, exemplified by &quot;sánzá&quot; → &quot;sánzá&quot; &#x27;moon(s) or month(s)&#x27;. Possible ambiguities are resolved by context.

Noun class prefixes show up not only on the noun itself, but as markers throughout a sentence. In the sentences below, the class prefixes are underlined. (There is a special verbal form &#x27;a&#x27; of the prefix for class 1 nouns.)


To a certain extent, noun class allocation is semantically governed. Classes 1/2, as in all Bantu languages, mainly contain words for human beings; similarly, classes 9/10 contain many words for animals. In other classes, semantical regularities are mostly absent or obscured by many exceptions.

===Verb inflections and morphology===

====Verbal extensions====
Four morphemes modify verbs. They are added to a verb root in the following order:
# Reversive (-ol-)
#: e.g.: kozinga &quot;to wrap&quot; and kozingola &quot;to develop&quot;
# Causative (-is-)
#: e.g. : koyéba &quot;to know&quot; and koyébisa &quot;to inform&quot;
# Applicative (-el-)
#: e.g. : kobíka &quot;to heal (self), to save (self)&quot; and kobíkela &quot;to heal (someone else), to save (someone)&quot;
# Passive (-am-)
#: e.g. : koboma &quot;to kill&quot; and kobomama &quot;to be killed&quot;
# Reciprocal or stationary (-an-, sometimes -en-)
#: e.g. : kokúta &quot;to find&quot; and kokútana &quot;to meet&quot;

====Tense inflections====
The first tone segment affects the subject part of the verb; the second attaches to the semantic morpheme attached to its root.
* present perfect (LH-í)
* simple present (LL-a)
* recurrent present (LL-aka)
* undefined recent past (LH-ákí)
* undefined distant past (LH-áká)
* future (L-ko-L-a)
* subjunctive (HL-a)

== Writing system ==
Lingala is more a spoken than a written language, and has several different writing systems, most of them ad hoc. As literacy in Lingala tends to be low, its popular orthography is very flexible and varies among the two republics. Some orthographies are heavily influenced by French; influences include a double S, &quot;ss&quot;, to transcribe [s] (in the Republic of the Congo); &quot;ou&quot; for [u] (in the Republic of the Congo); i with trema, &quot;aï&quot;, to transcribe or ; e with acute accent, &quot;é&quot;, to transcribe [e]; &quot;e&quot; to transcribe , o with acute accent, ó, to transcribe or sometimes [o] in opposition to o transcribing [o] or ; i or y can both transcribe [j]. The allophones are also found as alternating forms in the popular orthography; &quot;sango&quot; is an alternative to &quot;nsango&quot; (information or news); &quot;nyonso&quot;, &quot;nyoso&quot;, &quot;nionso&quot;, &quot;nioso&quot; (every) are all transcriptions of &quot;nyɔ́nsɔ&quot;.

In 1976, the &quot;Société Zaïroise des Linguistes&quot; (Zairian Linguists Society) adopted a writing system for Lingala, using the open e and the open o to write the vowels and , and sporadic usage of accents to mark tone, though the limitation of input methods prevents Lingala writers from easily using the and and the accents. For example, it is almost impossible to type Lingala according to that convention with a common English or French keyboard. The convention of 1976 reduced the alternative orthography of characters but did not enforce tone marking. The lack of consistent accentuation is lessened by contextual disambiguation.

The popular orthographies are often more simplified and ambiguous than the academic-based ones. Many Lingala books, papers, the translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Internet forums, newsletters, and major websites such as Google&#x27;s Lingala do not use the Lingala-specific characters ɛ and ɔ. Tone marking is found in most literary works.

=== Alphabet ===

The Lingala alphabet has 35 letters and digraphs. Each digraph has a specific place in the alphabet; for example, &quot;mza&quot; comes before &quot;mba&quot;, because the digraph &quot;mb&quot; follows the letter &quot;m&quot;. The letters &quot;r&quot; and &quot;h&quot; are rare but present in borrowed words. Accents indicate the tones as follows:
* no accent for default tone, the low tone
* acute accent for the high tone
* circumflex for descending tone
* caron for ascending tone

:&quot;(Article 1 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights)&quot;

===Mandombe===
The Mandombe script is an abugida, primarily used to write Kikongo, that can also be used for Lingala. It is used as a liturgical script in the church of Kimbangu.

<doc id="76568" wikidata="Q11985" url="?curid=76568" title="Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)">
<text>The Symphony No. 9 in E minor, &quot;From the New World&quot;, Op. 95, B. 178 (), also known as the New World Symphony, was composed by Antonín Dvořák in 1893 while he was the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America from 1892 to 1895. It premiered in New York City on 16 December 1893. It is one of the most popular of all symphonies. In older literature and recordings, this symphony was – as for its first publication – numbered as Symphony No. 5. 
The symphony was completed in the building that now houses the Bily Clocks Museum in Spillville, Iowa.

Astronaut Neil Armstrong took a tape recording including the &quot;New World Symphony&quot; along during the Apollo 11 mission, the first Moon landing, in 1969. 

== Instrumentation ==

This symphony is scored for the following orchestra:
* 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo)
* 2 oboes (one doubling English horn)
* 2 clarinets in B &amp; A
* 2 bassoons
* 4 horns in E, C and F
* 2 trumpets in E
* 3 trombones: alto, tenor, bass
* Tuba (second movement only)
* Timpani
* Triangle (third movement only)
* Cymbals (fourth movement only)
* Strings

== Form ==

A typical performance usually lasts around 40 minutes. The work is in four movements:
=== I. Adagio – Allegro molto ===
The movement is written in sonata form and begins with an introductory melody in Adagio. This melodic outline also appears in the third movement of Dvořák&#x27;s String Quintet No. 3 in E major and his Humoresque No. 1. The exposition is based on three thematic subjects. The first in E minor is notable for its announcing and responsive phrases. The second is in G minor and undergoes a transformation such that it resembles a Czech polka. The exposition&#x27;s closing theme in G major is known for being similar to the African-American spiritual &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;. The development primarily focuses on the main and closing themes, and the recapitulation consists of a repetition of the main theme as well as a transposition of the second and closing themes up a semitone. The movement is concluded with a coda, with the main theme stated by the brass above an orchestral tutti.

=== II. Largo ===
The second movement, written in ternary form, is introduced by a harmonic progression of chords in the wind instruments. Beckerman interprets these chords as a musical rendition of the narrative formula &quot;Once upon a time&quot;. Then a solo cor anglais (English horn) plays the famous main theme in D-flat major accompanied by muted strings. Dvořák was said to have changed the theme from clarinet to cor anglais as it reminded him of the voice of Harry Burleigh. The movement&#x27;s middle section contains a passage in C minor evoking a nostalgic and desolate mood which eventually leads into a funeral march above pizzicato steps in the basses. It is followed by a quasi-scherzo that incorporates this movement&#x27;s theme as well as the first movement&#x27;s main and closing themes. The Largo is concluded with the soft return of the main theme and introductory chords.

=== III. Molto vivace ===
The movement is a scherzo written in ternary form, with influences from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;. The stirring rhythm of the first part is interrupted by a trio middle section. The first part is then repeated, followed by an echo in the coda of the first movement&#x27;s main theme.

=== IV. Allegro con fuoco ===
The final movement is also written in sonata form. After a brief introduction, the horns and trumpets declare the movement&#x27;s main theme against sharp chords played by the rest of the orchestra. The second theme is then presented by the clarinet above tremolos in the strings. The development not only works with these two themes but also recalls the main themes of the first and second movements and a fragment of the Scherzo. Following the recapitulation which begins in the unexpected key of G minor but later corrects itself back to the original key, the movement reaches its climax in the coda, in which materials from the first three movements are reviewed for a final time while the Picardy third is expanded after the orchestra triumphantly plays a &quot;modally altered&quot; plagal cadence. The main theme, especially its occurrence in bar 321, bears a close resemblance to the opening theme of the &quot;Hans Heiling Overture&quot; by Heinrich Marschner.

== Influences ==
Dvořák was interested in Native American music and the African-American spirituals he heard in North America. While director of the National Conservatory he encountered an African-American student, Harry T. Burleigh, who sang traditional spirituals to him. Burleigh, later a composer himself, said that Dvořák had absorbed their &quot;spirit&quot; before writing his own melodies. Dvořák stated:

The symphony was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, and premiered on 16 December 1893, at Carnegie Hall conducted by Anton Seidl. A day earlier, in an article published in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; on 15 December 1893, Dvořák further explained how Native American music influenced his symphony:

In the same article, Dvořák stated that he regarded the symphony&#x27;s second movement as a &quot;sketch or study for a later work, either a cantata or opera ... which will be based upon Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot;&quot; (Dvořák never actually wrote such a piece). He also wrote that the third movement scherzo was &quot;suggested by the scene at the feast in &quot;Hiawatha&quot; where the Indians dance&quot;.

In 1893, a newspaper interview quoted Dvořák as saying &quot;I found that the music of the negroes and of the Indians was practically identical&quot;, and that &quot;the music of the two races bore a remarkable similarity to the music of Scotland&quot;. Most historians agree that Dvořák is referring to the pentatonic scale, which is typical of each of these musical traditions.

In a 2008 article in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, prominent musicologist Joseph Horowitz states that African-American spirituals were a major influence on Dvořák&#x27;s music written in North America, quoting him from an 1893 interview in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; as saying, &quot;In the negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music.&quot; Dvořák did, it seems, borrow rhythms from the music of his native Bohemia, as notably in his Slavonic Dances, and the pentatonic scale in some of his music written in North America from African-American and/or Native American sources. Statements that he borrowed melodies are often made but seldom supported by specifics. One verified example is the song of the Scarlet Tanager in the Quartet. Michael Steinberg writes that a flute solo theme in the first movement of the symphony resembles the spiritual &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;. Leonard Bernstein averred that the symphony was truly multinational in its foundations.

Dvořák was influenced not only by music he had heard but also by what he had seen in America. He wrote that he would not have composed his American pieces as he had if he had not seen America. It has been said that Dvořák was inspired by the &quot;wide open spaces&quot; of America, such as prairies he may have seen on his trip to Iowa in the summer of 1893. Notices about several performances of the symphony include the phrase &quot;wide open spaces&quot; about what inspired the symphony and/or about the feelings it conveys to listeners.

Dvořák was also influenced by the style and techniques used by earlier classical composers including Beethoven and Schubert. The falling fourths and timpani strokes in the &quot;New World Symphony&quot;″s Scherzo movement evoke the Scherzo of Beethoven&#x27;s Choral Symphony (Symphony No. 9). The use of quotations of prior movements in the symphony&#x27;s final movement is reminiscent of Beethoven quoting prior movements in the opening Presto of the Choral Symphony&#x27;s final movement.

== Reception ==

At the premiere in Carnegie Hall, the end of every movement was met with thunderous clapping and Dvořák felt obliged to stand up and bow. This was one of the greatest public triumphs of Dvořák&#x27;s career. When the symphony was published, several European orchestras soon performed it. Alexander Mackenzie conducted the London Philharmonic Society in the first London performance on 21 June 1894. Clapham says the symphony became &quot;one of the most popular of all time&quot; and at a time when the composer&#x27;s main works were being welcomed in no more than ten countries, this symphony reached the rest of the musical world and has become a &quot;universal favorite&quot;. As of 1978, it had been performed more often &quot;than any other symphony at the Royal Festival Hall, London&quot; and is in &quot;tremendous demand in Japan&quot;.

In the UK, the largo became familiar to the general public after its use in a 1973 television advert directed by Ridley Scott for the Hovis bakery. 

== &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; ==

The theme from the Largo was adapted into the spiritual-like song &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; (often mistakenly considered a folk song or traditional spiritual) by Dvořák&#x27;s pupil William Arms Fisher, who wrote the lyrics in 1922.

<text>Murdo MacKenzie (April 24, 1850 – May 30, 1939) was twice (1891–1901 and 1922–1937) manager of the Scots-owned Matador Land and Cattle Company, and founding president of the American Stock Growers Association, for whom he testified before congress and the Interstate Commerce Commission. His testimony led to passage of the Hepburn Act of 1906 which eased railroad fares for western shippers.

President Teddy Roosevelt appointed him to the National Conservation Commission in 1908, and it was Mackenzie, then manager of the Brazil Land, Cattle and Packing Company, with whom Roosevelt stayed when he visited Brazil in 1913.

==Biography==
MacKenzie was born near Tain, Ross-shire, Scotland, where he attended parish school and graduated from the Tain Royal Academy in 1869. He served in a law office and in the British Linen Bank, then as factor for Sir Charles Ross&#x27;s estate at Balnagown Castle. He married Isabella Stronach MacBain in 1876 and fathered five children with her. Among these was his son, David G. (Dode) MacKenzie, who, in December 1909, was shot in LeBeau, South Dakota, while also working for Matador. 

He sailed to the United States in 1885 to accept an offer to manage the Prairie Land and Cattle Company in Trinidad, Colorado. After becoming a naturalized citizen, he was elected mayor of Trinidad in 1891, before accepting the directorship at Matador.

He died, aged 89, in 1939 in Denver, Colorado, where he is buried.

The town of Murdo, South Dakota was named for Mackenzie.

In 1981, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==In popular culture==
MacKenzie appears as a character in the fictional Scrooge McDuck comic book, &quot;The Buckaroo of the Badlands&quot; (1992), set in 1882-1883, in which the poor, newly hired Scrooge, helped by Theodore Roosevelt, rescues a championship bull belonging to MacKenzie. At the beginning of &quot;Raider of the Copper Hill&quot; (1993), set in 1884, Scrooge leaves Mackenzie to prospect for copper while his former employer drives his herd to Texas.

<doc id="76572" wikidata="Q7298" url="?curid=76572" title="Antonín Dvořák">
<text>Antonín Leopold Dvořák ( ; ; 8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904) was a Czech composer. He frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia, following the Romantic-era nationalist example of his predecessor Bedřich Smetana. Dvořák&#x27;s style has been described as &quot;the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them,&quot; and Dvořák has been described as &quot;arguably the most versatile... composer of his time&quot;.

Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being a talented violin student. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was 31 years old. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted scores of symphonies and other works to German and Austrian competitions. He did not win a prize until 1874, with Johannes Brahms on the jury of the Austrian State Competition. In 1877, after his third win, Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock, who commissioned what became the &quot;Slavonic Dances&quot;, Op. 46. The sheet music&#x27;s high sales and critical reception led to his international success. A London performance of Dvořák&#x27;s Stabat Mater in 1883 led to many other performances in the United Kingdom, the United States, and eventually Russia in March 1890. The Seventh Symphony was written for London in 1885.

In 1892, Dvořák became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. While in the United States, Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony &quot;From the New World&quot;, which spread his reputation worldwide, and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti. On a summer holiday in Spillville, Iowa in 1893, Dvořák also wrote his most famous piece of chamber music, his twelfth String Quartet in F major, Op. 96, the &quot;American&quot;. While he remained at the Conservatory for a few more years, pay cuts and an onset of homesickness led him to return to Bohemia in 1895.

All of Dvořák&#x27;s ten operas, except his first, have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey the Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is &quot;Rusalka&quot;, premiered in 1901. Among his smaller works, the seventh &quot;Humoresque&quot; and the song &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot; are also widely performed and recorded. The Dvořák Prague International Music Festival is a major series of concerts held annually to celebrate Dvořák&#x27;s life and works.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dvořák was born in Nelahozeves near Prague, in the Austrian Empire, and was the eldest son of (1814–94) and his wife, (1820–82). František worked as an innkeeper, a professional player of the zither, and a butcher. Anna was the daughter of Josef Zdeněk, the bailiff of the Prince of Lobkowicz. Anna and František married on 17 November 1840. Dvořák was the first of 14 children, eight of whom survived infancy. Dvořák was baptized as a Roman Catholic in the village&#x27;s church of St. Andrew. Dvořák&#x27;s years in Nelahozeves nurtured his strong Christian faith and the love for his Bohemian heritage that so strongly influenced his music. In 1847, Dvořák entered primary school and was taught to play violin by his teacher Joseph Spitz. He showed early talent and skill, playing in a village band and in church. František was pleased with his son&#x27;s gifts. At the age of 13, through the influence of his father, Dvořák was sent to Zlonice to live with his uncle Antonín Zdenĕk in order to learn the German language. His first composition, the &quot;Forget-Me-Not Polka in C (Polka pomněnka)&quot; was written possibly as early as 1855.
Dvořák took organ, piano, and violin lessons from his German-language teacher . Liehmann also taught the young boy music theory and introduced him to the composers of the time; Dvořák had much regard for Liehmann despite his teacher&#x27;s violent temper. Liehmann was the church organist in Zlonice and sometimes let Antonín play the organ at services. Dvořák took further organ and music theory lessons at Česká Kamenice with Franz Hanke, who encouraged his musical talents even further and was more sympathetic. At the age of 16, through the urging of Liehmann and Zdenĕk, František allowed his son to become a musician, on the condition that the boy should work toward a career as an organist. After leaving for Prague in September 1857, Dvořák entered the city&#x27;s , studying singing with Josef Zvonař, theory with František Blažek, and organ with . The latter was not only a professor at the Prague Conservatory, but also a composer for the organ; his son Josef Bohuslav Foerster became a better known composer. Dvořák also took an additional language course to improve his German and worked as an &quot;extra&quot; violist in numerous bands and orchestras, including the orchestra of the St. Cecilia Society. Dvořák graduated from the Organ School in 1859, ranking second in his class. He applied unsuccessfully for a position as an organist at , but remained undaunted in pursuing a musical career.

In 1858, he joined Karel Komzák&#x27;s orchestra, with whom he performed in Prague&#x27;s restaurants and at balls. The high professional level of the ensemble attracted the attention of Jan Nepomuk Maýr, who engaged the whole orchestra in the Bohemian Provisional Theatre Orchestra. Dvořák played viola in the orchestra beginning in 1862. Dvořák could hardly afford concert tickets, and playing in the orchestra gave him a chance to hear music, mainly operas. In July 1863, Dvořák played in a program devoted to the German composer Richard Wagner, who conducted the orchestra. Dvořák had had &quot;unbounded admiration&quot; for Wagner since 1857. In 1862, Dvořák had begun composing his first string quartet. In 1864, Dvořák agreed to share the rent of a flat located in Prague&#x27;s Žižkov district with five other people, who also included violinist and , who later became a singer. In 1866, Maýr was replaced as chief conductor by Bedřich Smetana. Dvořák was making about $7.50 a month. The constant need to supplement his income pushed him to give piano lessons. It was through these piano lessons that he met his future wife. He originally fell in love with his pupil and colleague from the Provisional Theatre, , for whom he apparently composed the song-cycle &quot;Cypress Trees&quot;. However, she never returned his love and ended up marrying another man.

In 1873 Dvořák married Josefina&#x27;s younger sister, (1854–1931). They had nine children – Otakar (1874–1877), Josefa (1875–1875), Růžena (1876–1877), Otýlie (1878–1905), Anna (1880–1923), (1881–1952), Antonín (1883–1956), (1885–1961) and Aloisie (1888–1967). Otýlie, a composer in her own right, married Dvorak&#x27;s student, the composer Josef Suk in 1898, but died only seven years later. Otakar wrote a book about his father in 1960, just before he died.

=== Composer and organist ===

Dvořák called his String Quintet in A minor (1861) his Opus 1, and his First String Quartet (1862) his Opus 2, although the chronological Burghauser Catalogue numbers these as B.6 and B.7, showing five earlier compositions without opus numbers. In the early 1860s, Dvořák also made his first symphonic attempts, some of which he self-critically burned. The manuscript of a symphony in C minor without opus number, B.9, composed in 1865, was preserved. This symphony has come to be numbered as Dvořák&#x27;s First (see under &quot;Works&quot;). His first composing attempts passed without critical reception or public performances. His compositions up through 1870, according to the Burghauser Catalogue either had no known premieres, or were premiered in 1888 or later. For example, the Third String Quartet, B.18, was written in about 1869 but first published posthumously in 1964 and premiered in 1969. In 1870, he composed his first opera, &quot;Alfred&quot;, over the course of five months from May to October. Its overture was first publicly performed as late as 1905, and the full opera only in 1938.

In 1871, Dvořák left the Provisional Theatre orchestra to have more time for composing. Up through 1871 Dvořák only gave opus numbers up to 5 among his first 26 compositions. The first press mention of Antonín Dvořák appeared in the &quot;Hudební listy&quot; journal in June 1871, and the first publicly performed composition was the song &quot;Vzpomínání&quot; (&quot;Reminiscence&quot;, October 1871, musical evenings of ). The opera &quot;The King and the Charcoal Burner&quot; was returned to Dvořák from the Provisional Theatre and said to be unperformable. Its overture was premiered in 1872 in a Philharmonic concert conducted by Bedřich Smetana, but the full opera with the original score was performed once in 1929, and not heard again until a concert performance in September 2019 at the Dvořák Prague International Music Festival. Clapham says Dvořák realized he had gone to &quot;extremes in attempting to follow the example of Wagner&quot;. In 1873–74, he reset &quot;the King and Charcoal Burner libretto entirely afresh, in a totally different manner&quot;, without using &quot;anything from the ill-fated earlier version&quot;. The alternate opera, called &quot;King and Charcoal Burner II&quot;, B.42, was premiered in Prague in 1874.
On leaving the National Theater Orchestra after his marriage, Dvořák secured the job of organist at , also called St. Adalbert&#x27;s, Church in Prague under Josef Foerster, his former teacher at the Organ School. The job paid &quot;a mere pittance&quot;, but it was &quot;a welcome addition for the young couple&quot;. Despite these circumstances, Dvořák still managed to compose a substantial body of music around this time.

In November 1872, Dvořák&#x27;s Piano Quintet in A major, Op. 5, was performed in Prague, by a &quot;splendid team of players&quot; organized by Procházka. It was his first piece played in a concert. In March 1873, his Czech patriotic cantata &quot;The Heirs of the White Mountain&quot; was performed by the of 300 singers (conducted by his friend and supporter Karel Bendl) to a warm response from both audience and critics, making it an &quot;unqualified success&quot;. Dvořák&#x27;s compositions were first coming to be recognized in Prague.

When Dvořák turned age 33 in 1874, he remained almost unknown as a composer outside the area of Prague. That year, he applied for and won the Austrian State Prize (&quot;Stipendium&quot;) for composition, awarded in February 1875 by a jury consisting of the critic Eduard Hanslick, Johann Herbeck, director of the State Opera, and Johannes Brahms. It seems that Brahms had only recently joined the jury, as he was not on it during the calendar year of 1874, according to Hanslick. Hanslick had first-hand knowledge, as a continuing member of the jury
(from at least 1874 to 1877). Nevertheless, Brahms had time and opportunity to appreciate Dvořák&#x27;s 1874 submission. Leon Botstein says that the jury&#x27;s purpose was &quot;to award financial support to talented composers in need&quot; in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The jury received a &quot;massive submission&quot; from Dvořák: &quot;fifteen works including two symphonies, several overtures and a song cycle&quot;. Brahms was &quot;visibly overcome&quot; by the &quot;mastery and talent&quot; of Dvořák. The two symphonies were Dvořák&#x27;s third and fourth, both of which had been premiered in Prague in the spring of 1874.

Clapham gives the official report for the 1874 prize, saying Dvořák was a relatively impoverished music teacher who &quot;has submitted 15 compositions, among them symphonies, which display an undoubted talent...The applicant... deserves a grant to ease his straitened circumstances and free him from anxiety in his creative work.&quot; It says he had not yet owned a piano. Before being married, he had lodged with five other men, one of whom owned a small &quot;spinet&quot; piano.

In 1875, the year his first son was born, Dvořák composed his second string quintet, his 5th Symphony, Piano Trio No. 1, and Serenade for Strings in E. He again entered but this time did not win the Austrian State Prize. He did win it in 1876, and finally felt free to resign his position as an organist. In 1877, he wrote the &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;, and Ludevít Procházka conducted its premiere in Prague.

===International reputation===
Dvořák entered the Austrian Prize competition again in 1877, submitting his Moravian Duets and other music—possibly his Piano Concerto. He did not learn the outcome until December. Then, he received a personal letter from the music critic Eduard Hanslick, who had also been on the juries awarding the prizes. The letter not only notified Dvořák that he had again won the prize, but made known to him for the first time that Brahms and Hanslick had been on the jury. The letter conveyed an offer of friendly assistance of the two in making Dvořák&#x27;s music known outside his Czech motherland. Within the month December 1877, Dvořák wrote his String Quartet No. 9 in D minor and dedicated it to Brahms. Both Brahms and Hanslick had been much impressed by the Moravian Duets, and Brahms recommended them to his publisher, Simrock, who published them with success. Having in mind Brahms&#x27;s well-received Hungarian Dances, Simrock commissioned Dvořák to write something of the same nature. Dvořák submitted his Slavonic Dances, Op. 46 in 1878, at first for piano four hands, but when requested by Simrock, also in an orchestral version. These were an immediate and great success. On 15 December 1878, the leading music critic Louis Ehlert published a review of the Moravian Duets and Slavonic Dances in the Berlin &quot;Nationalzeitung&quot;, saying that the &quot;Dances&quot; would make their way &quot;round the world&quot; and &quot;a heavenly naturalness flows through this music&quot;. &quot;There was a run on the German music shops for the dances and duets of this hitherto... unknown composer.&quot; The dances were played in 1879 in concerts in France, England, and the United States. Later Simrock requested further Slavonic Dances, which Dvořák supplied in his Op. 72, 1886.

In 1879 Dvořák wrote his String Sextet. Simrock showed the score to the leading violinist Joseph Joachim, who with others premiered it in November of that year. Joachim became a &quot;chief champion&quot; of Dvořák&#x27;s chamber music. In that same year, Dvořák also wrote his Violin Concerto. In December, he dedicated the piece to Joachim and sent him the score. The next spring the two discussed the score and Dvořák revised it extensively, but Joachim was still not comfortable with it. The concerto was premiered in Prague in October 1883 by the violinist František Ondříček, who also played it in Vienna with conductor Hans Richter in December of that year. Twice later, Joachim was scheduled to play the concerto, but both times the arrangements fell through and he never did play it.

Hans Richter asked Dvořák to compose his Symphony No. 6 for the Vienna Philharmonic, intending to premiere it in December 1880. However, Dvořák later discovered that, despite this intention, members of the orchestra objected to performing works by the composer in two consecutive seasons, due to &quot;anti-Czech feeling&quot;. Adolf Čech therefore conducted the premiere of the symphony at a concert of the &quot;Philharmonia&quot; society (in Czech: &quot;spolek Filharmonie&quot;, predecessor of the Czech Philharmonic) on 25 March 1881, in Prague. Richter did eventually conduct the piece in London in 1882 and always retained an interest in Dvořák&#x27;s compositions.

=== Reception in Britain ===
Dvořák&#x27;s first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. However, after it was performed and very well received at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 10 March 1883, conducted by Joseph Barnby. The success &quot;sparked off a whole series of performances in England and the United States&quot;, a year ahead of appreciation in Germany and Austria. Dvořák was invited to visit Britain where he appeared to great acclaim in 1884. The London Philharmonic Society commissioned Dvořák to conduct concerts in London, and his performances were well received there. In response to the commission, Dvořák wrote his Symphony No. 7 and conducted its premiere at St. James&#x27;s Hall on 22 April 1885. On a visit later in 1885, Dvořák presented his cantata The Spectre&#x27;s Bride, in a concert on 27 August. He had arrived a week early to conduct rehearsals of the chorus of 500 voices and orchestra of 150. The performance was &quot;a greater triumph than any&quot; Dvořák &quot;had had in his life up to that time...following this phenomenal success, choral societies in the English-speaking countries hastened to prepare and present the new work.&quot; Dvořák visited Britain at least eight times in total, conducting his own works there. In 1887, Richter conducted the &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; in London and Vienna to great acclaim (they had been written ten years earlier and Dvořák had allowed them to languish after initial lack of interest from his publishers). Richter wrote to Dvořák of the London performance, &quot;at the hundreds of concerts I have conducted during my life, no new work has been as successful as yours.&quot;

=== 1888–1891 ===
Despite Dvořák&#x27;s newfound success, a February 1888 performance of Stabat Mater in Vienna fell victim to more anti-Czech feeling and what the composer called &quot;destructive criticism&quot;. He heartily thanked Richter for his &quot;courage and devoted sympathy&quot;. In 1890, influenced by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Dvořák also visited Russia, and conducted performances of his music in Moscow and St. Petersburg. In 1891, Dvořák received an honorary degree from the University of Cambridge, and was offered a position at the Prague Conservatory as professor of composition and instrumentation. At first he refused the offer, but then later accepted; this change of mind was seemingly a result of a quarrel with his publisher Simrock over payment for his Eighth Symphony. Dvořák&#x27;s Requiem was premiered later that year in Birmingham at the Triennial Music Festival.

In 1891 the Bohemian String Quartet, later called the Czech Quartet, was founded, with Karel Hoffmann, first violin, Josef Suk, second violin, Oskar Nedbal, viola, and , cello. It is said that Nedbal and Suk had been two of Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;most promising&quot; students at the Conservatory and took the initiative in founding the Quartet. As of 1891 Dvořák had written 11 string quartets, six of which had been premiered, and these were available as part of the repertory of the Quartet on tour, as were the two quartets of Smetana.

===United States===
From 1892 to 1895, Dvořák was the director of the National Conservatory of Music in New York City. The Conservatory&#x27;s President, Jeannette Thurber, offered Dvořák an annual salary of $15,000 – an incredibly lavish sum for the era (), twenty-five times what he was paid at the Prague Conservatory. Emanuel Rubin describes the Conservatory and Dvořák&#x27;s time there. Thurber, a wealthy and philanthropic woman, made it open to women and black students as well as white men, which was unusual for the times. Dvořák&#x27;s original contract provided for three hours a day of work, including teaching and conducting, six days a week, with four months of vacation each summer. The Panic of 1893, a severe economic depression, depleted the assets of the Thurber family and other patrons of the Conservatory. In 1894, Dvořák&#x27;s salary was cut to $8,000 per year and moreover was paid only irregularly. The Conservatory was located at 126–128 East Seventeenth Street, but was demolished in 1911 and replaced by what is today a high school.

Dvořák&#x27;s main goal in America was to discover &quot;American Music&quot; and engage in it, much as he had used Czech folk idioms within his music. Shortly after his arrival in America in 1892, Dvořák wrote a series of newspaper articles reflecting on the state of American music. He supported the concept that African-American and Native American music should be used as a foundation for the growth of American music. He felt that through the music of Native Americans and African-Americans, Americans would find their own national style of music. Here Dvořák met Harry Burleigh, who later became one of the earliest African-American composers. Burleigh introduced Dvořák to traditional African-American spirituals.

In the winter and spring of 1893, Dvořák was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic to write Symphony No. 9, &quot;From the New World&quot;, which was premiered under the baton of Anton Seidl, to tumultuous applause. Clapham writes that &quot;without question this was one of the greatest triumphs, and very possibly the greatest triumph of all that Dvořák experienced&quot; in his life, and when the Symphony was published it was &quot;seized on by conductors and orchestras&quot; all over the world.

Two months before leaving for America, Dvořák had hired as secretary , who had just finished violin studies at the Prague Conservatory and was about to return to his home in the United States. There he continued to serve as Dvořák&#x27;s secretary and lived with the Dvořák family. He had come from the Czech-speaking community of Spillville, Iowa, where his father Jan Josef Kovařík was a schoolmaster. Dvořák decided to spend the summer of 1893 in Spillville, along with all his family; he referred to it as his &quot;summer Vysoka.&quot; While there he composed the String Quartet in F (the &quot;American&quot;) and the String Quintet in E major. Back in New York that autumn, he composed his Sonatina for violin and piano. He also conducted a performance of his Eighth Symphony at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago that same year.

In the winter of 1894–95, Dvořák wrote his Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104, B. 191, completed in February 1895. However, due to homesickness, his partially unpaid salary, and increasing recognition in Europe – he had been made an honorary member of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna – he decided to return to Bohemia. He informed Thurber that he was leaving. Dvořák and his wife left New York before the end of the spring term, with no intention of returning.

Dvořák&#x27;s New York home was located at 327 East Seventeenth Street, near the intersection of what is today called Perlman Place.
It was in this house that both the B minor Cello Concerto and the New World Symphony were written within a few years. Despite protests, from Czech President Václav Havel among others who wanted the house preserved as a historical site, it was demolished in 1991 to make room for a Beth Israel Medical Center residence for people with AIDS. In 2017, this residence was converted into a homeless shelter. To honor Dvořák, a statue of him was erected in nearby Stuyvesant Square.

Brahms continued to try to &quot;clear a path for&quot; Dvořák, &quot;the only contemporary whom he considered really worthy&quot;. While Dvořák was in America, Simrock was still publishing his music in Germany, and Brahms corrected proofs for him. Dvořák said it was hard to understand why Brahms would &quot;take on the very tedious job of proofreading. I don&#x27;t believe there is another musician of his stature in the whole world who would do such a thing.&quot;

===Return to Europe and last years===

Dvořák returned from the United States on 27 April 1895 with his wife and Otakar Berger. After a performance of &quot;Dimitrij&quot; at the National Theater on 19 May, Dvořák left the city for the family country cottage in Vysoká. Dvořák&#x27;s first love and later sister-in-law, Josefina Kaunitzová, née Čermáková, died in May 1895. He and she had maintained friendly relations over the years. After her death, he revised the coda of his Cello Concerto in her memory.

During Dvořák&#x27;s final years, he concentrated on composing opera and chamber music. In November 1895, he resumed his professorship at the Prague Conservatory. Between 1895 and 1897, he completed his string quartets in A major and G major, and also worked on the cycle of symphonic poems inspired by the collection &quot;Kytice&quot; by Karel Jaromír Erben. As seen in Burghauser&#x27;s 1960 Catalogue, Dvořák wrote his five Symphonic Poems in 1896, but after that completed few works per year, mainly operas: &quot;Jakobín&quot; in 1896, nothing in 1897, only &quot;The Devil and Kate&quot; in 1898–1899, &quot;Rusalka&quot; in 1900, two songs and &quot;Recitatives&quot; in 1900–1901, and finally the opera &quot;Armida&quot; in 1902–1903. &quot;Rusalka&quot; became the most popular of all Dvořák&#x27;s ten operas and gained an international reputation (below under Works, Operas).

In 1896 he visited London for the last time to conduct the premiere of his Cello Concerto in B minor by the London Philharmonic. Also in 1896, Brahms tried to persuade Dvořák, who had several children, to move to Vienna. Brahms said he had no dependents and &quot;If you need anything, my fortune is at your disposal&quot;. Clapham writes &quot;Dvořák was deeply moved and tears came to his wife&#x27;s eyes, but it was quite impossible for him, a Czech, to contemplate leaving Bohemia.&quot; Brahms himself had little time left to live, as he died 3 April 1897. Also, Brahms hoped to gain an ally in Vienna to &quot;counterbalance the influence of&quot; Bruckner.
 In 1897 Dvořák&#x27;s daughter married his student, the composer Josef Suk. In the same year, Dvořák visited Brahms on his deathbed and attended his funeral on 6 April 1897. In November Dvořák was appointed a member of the jury for the Viennese Artists&#x27; Stipendium. He was informed in November 1898 that Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary would award him a gold medal for &quot;Litteris et Artibus&quot;, the ceremony taking place before an audience in June 1899. On 4 April 1900 Dvořák conducted his last concert with the Czech Philharmonic, performing Brahms&#x27; Tragic Overture, Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished&quot; Symphony, Beethoven&#x27;s 8th Symphony, and Dvořák&#x27;s own symphonic poem &quot;The Wild Dove&quot;. In April 1901, The Emperor appointed him a member of the Austrian House of Lords, along with the leading Czech poet Jaroslav Vrchlický. Dvořák also succeeded Antonín Bennewitz as director of the Prague Conservatory from November 1901 until his death. Dvořák&#x27;s 60th birthday was celebrated as a national event. First, around the actual date, six of his operas and the oratorio St. Ludmila were performed in Prague, but Dvořák was away in Vienna; then in November 1901 came the &quot;postponed official birthday party... In many towns all over Bohemia and Moravia, the Czech people celebrated his birthday.&quot;

On 25 March 1904 Dvořák had to leave a rehearsal of &quot;Armida&quot; because of illness. The first Czech Musical Festival, in April 1904, had &quot;a programme consisting almost entirely&quot; of Dvořák&#x27;s music (Leoš Janáček was disappointed that none of his music was performed.) &quot;Seventy-six choral associations&quot; from all over Bohemia gathered in Prague, and &quot;sixteen thousand singers&quot; sang Dvořák&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Saint Ludmila&quot;. &quot;Thousands of listeners celebrated&quot; the symphony &quot;From the New World&quot;. Dvořák himself was forced by illness to &quot;take to his bed&quot; and so was unable to attend.

Dvořák had an &quot;attack of influenza&quot; on 18 April and died on 1 May 1904, of an undiagnosed cause following five weeks of illness, at the age of 62, leaving many unfinished works. His funeral service was held on 5 May, and his remains were buried in Vyšehrad Cemetery in Prague, beneath a bust by Czech sculptor Ladislav Šaloun.

==Style==

Many of Dvořák&#x27;s compositions, such as the &quot;Slavonic Dances&quot; and his large collection of songs, were directly inspired by Czech, Moravian, and other Slavic traditional music. As the basis for his works, Dvořák frequently used Slavic folk dance forms including the skočná; the Bohemian furiant, sousedská, and špacirka; the Slovak odzemek; the Polish mazurka and polonaise; the Yugoslav Kolo; and folk song forms of Slavic peoples, including the Ukrainian dumka. His 16 Slavonic Dances, Op. 46, which first brought him a wide reputation, and Op. 72, include at least one of each of these forms. He also wrote an orchestral &quot;Polonaise&quot; (1879). He named the third movement of his 6th Symphony as &quot;Scherzo (Furiant)&quot;. His Dumky Trio is one of his best-known chamber works, and is named for the dumka, a traditional Ukrainian and Slavic genre. His major works reflect his heritage and love for his native land. Dvořák followed in the footsteps of Bedřich Smetana, the creator of the modern Czech musical style.

Dvořák had been an admirer of Wagner&#x27;s music since 1857. Late in life, he said that Wagner &quot;was so great a genius that he was capable of doing things that were beyond the reach of other composers&quot;. Wagner especially influenced Dvořák&#x27;s operas, but also some orchestral pieces. According to Clapham, the theme of the Andante Sostenuto from his fourth symphony &quot;could almost have come directly out of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;&quot;.

From 1873 on, Dvořák&#x27;s style was &quot;moving steadily in the direction of classical models&quot;. To be more specific about &quot;classical models,&quot; in 1894 Dvořák wrote an article in which he said the composers of the past he admired most were Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. As the article was specifically on Schubert, three years in advance of the centennial of his birth, it seems Dvořák had a special predilection toward Schubert.

==Works==


Dvořák wrote in a variety of forms: his nine symphonies generally conform to classical models, but he also composed the new symphonic poems. Many of his works show the influence of Czech folk music rhythms and melodic shapes. Amongst them are the two sets of Slavonic Dances, the &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot;, and the majority of his songs. The echoes of such influence are also found in his major choral works. Dvořák wrote operas (of which the best known is &quot;Rusalka&quot;), serenades for string orchestra and wind ensemble, chamber music (including a number of string quartets and quintets), and piano music.

===Numbering===
A large number of Dvořák&#x27;s works were given opus numbers, but not always in the order in which they were written or published. To improve sales, some publishers such as N. Simrock preferred to represent budding composers as being well established by giving early works much higher opus numbers than their chronological order would merit. In other cases, Dvořák deliberately assigned lower opus numbers to new works to be able to sell them outside contract obligations to his publishers. An example is the &quot;Czech Suite&quot;, which Dvořák did not want to sell to Simrock, and had published with Schlesinger as Op. 39 instead of Op. 52. This led to the same opus number being given to more than one of Dvořák&#x27;s works; for example, the opus number 12 was assigned successively to the opera &quot;King and Charcoal Burner&quot; (1871), the Concert Overture in F (1871, derived from the opera), the String Quartet No. 6 in A minor (1873), the Furiant in G minor for piano (1879), and the Dumka in C minor for piano (1884). In other cases, a work was given as many as three different opus numbers by different publishers.

To add to this confusion, the numbering of Dvořák&#x27;s symphonies has varied:
*they were initially numbered by order of publication instead of composition
*the first four symphonies to be composed were published after the last five
*the last five symphonies were not published in order of composition, explaining why, for example, the &quot;New World Symphony&quot; originally published as No. 5, was later known as No. 8, and then renumbered as No. 9 in the critical editions published in the 1950s.

All of Dvořák&#x27;s works were catalogued chronologically by Jarmil Burghauser. As an example, in the Burghauser catalogue, the &quot;New World Symphony&quot;, Op. 95, is B.178. Scholars today often refer to Dvořák&#x27;s works by their B numbers (for Burghauser), partly because many early works do not have opus numbers. References to the traditional opus numbers are still common because of their historical continuity with earlier scores and printed programs. The opus numbers remain more likely to appear in printed performance programs.

===Symphonies===
During Dvořák&#x27;s life, only five of his symphonies were widely known. The first one published was the sixth, dedicated to Hans Richter. After Dvořák&#x27;s death, research uncovered four unpublished symphonies. The manuscript of the first one had even been lost to the composer himself. This led to the situation in which the &quot;New World Symphony&quot; has successively been called the 5th, 8th and 9th. The modern chronological numbering system is used here.

With their lyrical style and accessibility to the listener, Dvořák&#x27;s symphonies seem to derive from the Schubertian tradition; but, as Taruskin suggests, the difference was Dvořák&#x27;s use of cyclic form, especially in his later symphonies and concertos, where he &quot;occasionally recycled themes... to a degree which lent his works a tinge of secret &#x27;programmaticism&#x27;&quot;.

Symphony No. 1 in C minor, Op. 3, was written in 1865 when Dvořák was 24 years old. It was later subtitled &quot;The Bells of Zlonice&quot;, in reference to the time Dvořák spent in the village of Zlonice, and in the church there, between the age of 13 and 16. Like the Symphony No. 2 in B major, Op. 4, also in 1865, despite touches of originality, it did not remain in the standard symphonic repertory.

Symphony No. 3 in E major, Op. 10 (c. 1873), shows the impact of Dvořák&#x27;s acquaintance with the music of Richard Wagner. This influence is less evident in Symphony No. 4 in D minor, Op. 13, except for the start of the second movement.

Symphony No. 5 in F major, Op. 76, and Symphony No. 6 in D major, Op. 60, are largely pastoral in nature. The Sixth, published in 1880, shows a resemblance to the Symphony No. 2 of Brahms, particularly in the outer movements, but not so much in the third-movement furiant, a vivid Czech dance. This was the symphony that made Dvořák internationally known as a symphonic composer.

Symphony No. 7 in D minor of 1885, Op. 70, is highly regarded by critics and musicologists; Sir Donald Tovey stated that &quot;along with the four Brahms symphonies and Schubert&#x27;s Ninth, it is among the greatest and purest examples in this art-form since Beethoven&quot;.

Symphony No. 8 in G major, Op. 88, is characterized by a warmer and more optimistic tone. Karl Schumann (in booklet notes for a recording of all the symphonies by Rafael Kubelík) compares it to the works of Gustav Mahler.
Symphony No. 9 in E minor, Op. 95, is also known by its subtitle &quot;From the New World&quot;, or as the &quot;New World Symphony&quot;. Dvořák wrote it between January and May 1893, while he was in New York. At the time of its first performance, he claimed that he used elements from American music such as spirituals and Native American music in this work, but he later denied this. Neil Armstrong took a recording of the &quot;New World Symphony&quot; to the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, and in 2009 it was voted the favourite symphony in a poll run by ABC Classic FM in Australia. It has also been used by the WWE as the entrance music for superstar Gunther.

Many conductors have recorded cycles of the symphonies, including Karel Ančerl, Jiří Bělohlávek, Gustavo Dudamel, Neeme Järvi, István Kertész, Rafael Kubelík, Zdeněk Mácal, Václav Neumann, Libor Pešek, Witold Rowicki, and Otmar Suitner.

Adolf Čech premiered more of Dvořák&#x27;s symphonies than anyone else. He conducted the first performances of Nos. 2, 5 and 6; the composer premiered Nos. 7 and 8; Bedřich Smetana led Nos. 3 and 4; Anton Seidl conducted No. 9; and Milan Sachs premiered No. 1.

===Symphonic poems===
Franz Liszt invented the symphonic poem, never employed by more conservative Romantic composers such as Brahms.
Dvořák wrote five symphonic poems, all in 1896–1897 with sequential opus numbers: &quot;The Water Goblin&quot;, Op. 107; &quot;The Noon Witch&quot;, Op. 108; &quot;The Golden Spinning Wheel&quot;, Op. 109; &quot;The Wild Dove&quot;, Op. 110; and &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Song&quot;, Op. 111. The first four of poems are based upon ballads from the collection &quot;Kytice&quot; by the Czech folklorist Karel Jaromír Erben. &quot;A Hero&#x27;s Song&quot; is based on a program of Dvořák&#x27;s devising and is believed to be autobiographical.

===Choral works===

To Dvořák&#x27;s main choral works belong his setting of Stabat Mater (the longest extant setting of that text), his Requiem, his setting of the Te Deum and his Mass in D major.

The Stabat Mater, Op. 58, is an extensive (c. 90 minutes) vocal-instrumental sacred work for soli (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), choir and orchestra based on the text of an old church hymn with the same name. The inspiration for creating this piece was the death of the composer&#x27;s daughter, Josefa.

Antonín Dvořák composed his Requiem in 1890, at the beginning of the peak period of his career. Dvořák was deeply religious, and this work reflects his faith and spirituality. The premiere took place on 9 October 1891 in Birmingham, conducted by Dvořák himself, and was &quot;very successful&quot;. It had an outstanding success in Boston 30 November 1892: &quot;the composer was frequently applauded between numbers and given a most enthusiastic ovation at the end.&quot;. In Vienna it was greeted, belatedly, in 1901: &quot;The Vienna performance in March 1901 was a triumph of Dvořák&#x27;s music, as if the Viennese public wished thereby to make up for their earlier, sometimes cool reception of his works.&quot;

The Te Deum, Op. 103, is a cantata for soprano and baritone solo, choir and orchestra to the Latin text of the famous hymn Te Deum (God, we laud You). It was composed in 1892 and dedicated to the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. The composition had been completed before Dvořák moved to America and was commissioned by Jeanette Thurber in 1891, when the composer accepted a position as director of her school. Te Deum is more intimate than the Stabat Mater and Requiem. It was premiered at Dvořák&#x27;s first concert in New York on 21 October 1892.

The Mass in D major (first numbered Op. 76, then Op. 86) was originally intended for organ, solo voices and small choir. The work was finalized in 1892 when, in response to a request from the Novello publishers of London, Dvořák arranged his Mass for a symphony orchestra.

The oratorio &quot;Saint Ludmila&quot; was a huge success in Bohemia and Moravia, sung at events in Dvořák&#x27;s honor in 1901 and 1904. The piece had considerable success in England in October 1886, with an audience on the 15th &quot;in raptures... the critics praised the music in the warmest terms&quot;, and on the 29th, there was a &quot;large and equally enthusiastic audience, and once again the critics were full of praise&quot;, but the libretto&#x27;s translation from Czech into English was &quot;regarded on all sides as unsatisfactory&quot;.

The cantata &quot;The Spectre&#x27;s Bride&quot;, Op. 69, B. 135, performed in 1885 at the Birmingham, England, Musical Festival, was the greatest success to that point in Dvořák&#x27;s career.

===Concerti===
The critic Harold C. Schonberg described &quot;an attractive Piano Concerto in G minor with a rather ineffective piano part, a beautiful Violin Concerto in A minor, and a supreme Cello Concerto in B minor&quot;. All the concerti are in the classical three-movement form.

The Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in G minor, Op. 33 was the first of three concerti (for solo instrument and orchestra) that Dvořák composed, but is perhaps the least known of the three.

The Concerto for Violin and Orchestra in A minor, Op. 53 was written in 1878 for Joseph Joachim, a prominent violinist whom Dvořák had met and admired. It was finished in 1879, but Joachim was skeptical of the work. The concerto was premiered in 1883 in Prague by the violinist František Ondříček, who also gave its first performances in Vienna and London.

The Concerto for Cello and Orchestra in B minor, Op. 104 was the final concerto to be composed. He wrote it in 1894–1895 for his friend Hanuš Wihan. Wihan and others had asked for a cello concerto for some time, but Dvořák refused, stating that the cello was a fine orchestral instrument but completely insufficient for a solo concerto. Dvořák composed the concerto in New York while serving as the Director of the National Conservatory. In 1894, Victor Herbert, who was also teaching at the Conservatory, had written his Second Cello Concerto, Op. 30 and presented it several times that year, including its successful premiere with the New York Philharmonic under Anton Seidl. Dvořák attended at least two performances of Herbert&#x27;s cello concerto and was inspired to fulfill Wihan&#x27;s request for a cello concerto. Dvořák&#x27;s concerto premiered in London on 16 March 1896, with the English cellist Leo Stern. The reception was &quot;enthusiastic&quot;. Brahms said of the work: &quot;Had I known that one could write a cello concerto like this, I would have written one long ago!&quot; Agreeing with Schonberg, the cellist and author Robert Battey wrote &quot;I believe it to be the greatest of all cello concertos...an opinion shared by most cellists&quot;. A compiler of discographies of Dvořák&#x27;s music wrote that his is the &quot;king&quot; of cello concertos.

In 1865, early in his career, Dvořák had composed a Cello concerto in A major with Piano accompaniment, B. 10. Günter Raphael in 1925–1929 produced a revised and orchestrated version. Dvořák&#x27;s cataloguer Jarmil Burghauser made another orchestration and abridgement, published in 1975.

===Chamber music===

A viola player himself, Dvořák had a natural affinity for string instruments. Over a period of thirty years, Dvořák composed over forty chamber music works.

==== String quintets ====
In 1860, just after he completed his education at the Prague Organ School, Dvořák composed his String Quintet No. 1 in A minor, Op. 1. Two more would follow, of which the String Quintet No. 2 in G major, Op. 77 from early 1875, is noteworthy for the use of a double bass. This quintet was written towards the end of the composer&#x27;s transitional phase, incorporating a thematic density to his works. This quintet is characterized by delicate operetta style uncommon in his instrumental work. The extension of a variation to all section is reminiscent of his symphonic literature. It was written for a chamber music competition sponsored by the &quot;Umělecká beseda&quot; (Artistic Circle), where it was unanimously awarded a prize of five ducats for the &quot;distinction of theme, the technical skill in polyphonic composition, the mastery of form and the knowledge of the instruments&quot; displayed. The String Quintet No. 3 in E major, Op. 97, with a second viola added, was written near the end of his American period in 1893, when he spent a summer holiday in Spillville, Iowa.

==== String quartets ====
In the 1880s Dvořák made a list of his destroyed compositions, including string quartets in B-flat, D and E minor of 1868–70. Dvořák destroyed these compositions during his &quot;mad period&quot; only after copies had already been printed. The number of errors in the parts makes it unlikely that they were ever played. Dvořák kept the manuscripts of these quartets but did not give them opus numbers. They are noted to have numbers B.17, B.18, and B.19 in the Burghauser catalog and show the strong influence of the music of Richard Wagner. The second, third, and fourth quartets illustrate Dvořák&#x27;s progress as a composer. He demonstrates understanding of highly developed musical language in his D major quartet, shaping the melody of the Slav freedom song &quot;Hej Slovane&quot; (&#x27;Hey, Slavs!&#x27;) in a variation style. The quartet in E minor is a single movement, including a slow, 63 bars on an F# pedal point. The single movement from the E minor quartet was used five years later in his second string quintet Op. 77, as a second movement named &quot;Intermezzo: Nocturne&quot;, making this initially a five-movement composition. He later withdrew the second movement and reworked it into the Nocturne for Strings in B major, Op. 40 (B. 47). These show a stronger sense of form and include three separate arrangements: for orchestra (B47), for violin and piano (B48A), and for piano four hands (B48B).

During his time in America in 1893, Dvořák composed two of his most popular quartets: the String Quartet No. 12 in F, Op. 96 (&quot;The American&quot;) and the String Quintet in E-flat, Op. 97 (B180). Dvořák composed this work in three days after he and his family reunited in Spillville, Iowa. He drew inspiration from the freedom he felt in the countryside of America. This piece is distinguishable from his other quartets due to the simplicity of it writing. Throughout the piece, Dvořák uses skipping rhythms, high register of the first violin, and unified key relationships among all movements except for Lento. There is less shaping in thematic material, heavy uses of repetition, and less attention was paid to the development. Shortly after the composition of Op. 96, Dvořák composed his E-flat Major String Quintet, Op. 97. This piece was distinguished from his prior chamber works due to the instrumentation of two viola parts. The influence that Native American folk music had on Dvořák&#x27;s work was also apparent in Op. 97; there is a common drum rhythm in Native American music presented throughout all of the movements except the Larghetto.

==== Other chamber works ====
He also composed two piano quintets, both in A major, of which the second, Op. 81, is the better known. He left a Terzetto for two violins and viola (Op. 74); two piano quartets (Op. 23 and Op. 87), a string sextet, Op. 48; and four piano trios, including the Piano Trio No. 4 (subtitled &quot;Dumky&quot;), Op. 90. He also wrote a set of &quot;Bagatelles&quot;, Op. 47, for the unusual combination of two violins, cello, and harmonium. The Bagatelles are cyclical and similar to a suite, echoing Czech bagpipe melodies. Dvořák wrote two waltzes for string quartet, and arranged set of 12 love songs for the string quartet entitled &quot;Echo of Songs&quot; (B152), taken from his set of 18 songs originally composed in 1865 entitled &quot;Cypresses&quot;. His works for violin and piano include the &quot;Romantic Pieces&quot;, the Violin Sonatina, and the Violin Sonata.

===Operas===
In a 1904 interview, Dvořák claimed that opera was &#x27;the most suitable form for the nation&#x27;. If this nationalist sentiment was at the heart of his opera compositions, he struggled to find a style straddling Czech traditional melody and the grand opera style of Giacomo Meyerbeer, which he experienced as lead viola player in the orchestra of Prague&#x27;s Provisional Theatre between 1862 and 1871, and whose influence is evident in his works such as &quot;Vanda&quot; and &quot;Dimitrij&quot;. His later interest in the music of Richard Wagner also influenced his operas, evident in his extensive rewrite of &quot;Dmitrij&quot; in 1894, following its failure at Vienna.

Of all his operas, only &quot;Rusalka&quot;, Op. 114, which contains the well-known aria &quot;Měsíčku na nebi hlubokém&quot; (&quot;Song to the Moon&quot;), is played on contemporary opera stages with any frequency outside the Czech Republic. This is attributable to their uneven invention and libretti, and perhaps also their staging requirements – &quot;The Jacobin&quot;, &quot;Armida&quot;, &quot;Vanda&quot; and &quot;Dimitrij&quot; need stages large enough to portray invading armies.

There is speculation by Dvořák scholars such as Michael Beckerman that the second movement of his Symphony No. 9 &quot;From the New World&quot;, was adapted from studies for a never-written opera about Hiawatha.

===Songs===
The song cycle of 10 &quot;Biblical Songs&quot;, Op. 99, B. 185, was written in March 1894. Around that time Dvořák was informed of the death of the famous conductor, and his close personal friend, Hans von Bülow. A month earlier, he had been grieved to hear that his father was near death, far away in Bohemia. Dvořák consoled himself in the Psalms. The resulting work, considered the finest of his song cycles, is based on the text of the Czech Bible of Kralice. Dvořák&#x27;s father died 28 March 1894, two days after the completion of the work.

Another well known cycle is the seven &quot;Gypsy Songs&quot; (Czech &quot;Cikánské melodie&quot;) B. 104, Op. 55 which includes &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot; (the fourth of the set).

Dvořák created many other songs inspired by Czech national traditional music, such as the &quot;Love Songs&quot;, &quot;Evening Songs&quot;, etc.

===Other works===

From other works that show the influence of Czech folk rhythms and melodic shapes, perhaps the best known examples are the two sets of Slavonic Dances. The first book, Op. 46 (1878), is predominantly Czech in form. It was created for piano duet (one piano, four hands), but Dvořák then orchestrated the entire set, completing it the same year. The second book, Op. 72 (also composed originally for piano four hands), composed eight years later, includes forms native to other Slavic lands Serbia, Poland and Ukraine, although some &quot;merge characteristics of more than one dance&quot;. Dvořák did not use actual folk tunes, but created his own themes in the style of traditional folk music, using the rhythms of original folk dances.

A work that does not fit in the other categories is the &quot;Symphonic Variations&quot; of 1877. Orchestral variations on an original theme, composed as a freestanding work, were a rather unusual genre. Originally unsuccessful and revived only after ten years, it has since established itself in the repertoire.

==Legacy==

Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;Largo&quot; from the &quot;New World Symphony&quot; was one of several pieces performed in a Japanese internment camp on Sumatra by a vocal orchestra made up of female prisoners of war on 27 December 1943.

The 1980 film &quot;Concert at the End of Summer&quot; is based on Dvořák&#x27;s life. Dvořák was played by Josef Vinklář. The 2012 television film &quot;The American Letters&quot; focuses on Dvořák&#x27;s love life. Dvořák is played by Hynek Čermák. Ian Krykorka has written a number of children&#x27;s books based on some of Dvořák&#x27;s operas. Josef Škvorecký wrote &quot;Dvorak in Love&quot; about his life in America as Director of the National Conservatory for Music.

Asteroid 2055 Dvořák, discovered by Luboš Kohoutek, is named in his honor. Dvorak (Anton) Park in Chicago&#x27;s Pilsen Historic District is also named after the composer.

<text>Los Broncos de Reynosa (English: Reynosa Broncos) were a Mexican team that played in the Adolfo Lopez Mateos stadium in the city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas.

The Broncos de Reynosa played in the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol and it was part of the Zona Norte division.

The Broncos returned to Reynosa&#x27;s Stadium Adolfo Lopez Mateos in March 2009 through the efforts of Mayor Oscar Luebbeert. Major improvements to the stadium were made to attract fans. The stadium went into some major improvements that include converting the stadium into a big skeleton in order to renew installations, new parking section, new WC areas, new box seats. There was a change of team colors moving from the traditional orange to a new green.

Broncos de Reynosa won the Championship of The Liga Mexicana de Beisbol in 1969, defeating the Sultanes de Monterrey.

The Broncos franchise has been transferred to the Bravos de León twice, in 1982 and 2016.
