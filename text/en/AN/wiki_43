<text>Cyrene (, ), also spelled Kyrene (, ; ) is a figure in Greek mythology considered the etymon of the Greek colony of Cyrene in eastern Libya in North Africa. She was said to have been a Thessalian princess who became the queen of Cyrene, founded and named in her honor by the god Apollo. The story is entirely apocryphal, the city having been founded by settlers from Thera.

== Family ==
As recorded in Pindar&#x27;s ninth Pythian ode, Cyrene was the daughter of Hypseus, king of the Lapiths, and the naiad Chlidanope. According to Apollonius Rhodius, she also had a sister called Larissa. Cyrene&#x27;s other sisters were Themisto, Alcaea and Astyagyia.

By the god Apollo, she bore Aristaeus and Idmon. Aristaeus became the god of animal husbandry, bee-keeping and cheese making. Idmon became a famed seer. Apollonius Rhodius states that the couple also had another son called Autuchus.

== Mythology ==

=== Apollo ===
Cyrene was a Thessalian princess, the daughter of Hypseus. She was a fierce huntress, called by Nonnus, a &quot;deer-chasing second Artemis, the girl lionkiller&quot; and &quot;a champion in the leafy forest with lionslaying hands&quot;. In &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot; (written by Aristophanes) Mnesilochus comments that he &quot;can&#x27;t see a man there at all - only Cyrene&quot; when setting eyes upon the poet Agathon who has dressed in women&#x27;s clothing and accessorised himself with male and female attributes. She was a companion of goddess Artemis, who had given her two hunting dogs. With the help of these dogs, Cyrene had been able to win the prize in the funeral games of Pelias. Pindar describes her in his Pythian Ode:And by Hypseus was reared this maid, Cyrene of the lovely arms. But she loved not the pacing tread this way and that beside the loom, nor the delights of merry feasts with her companions in the household. But the bronze-tipped javelin and the sword called her to combat and slay the wild animals of the field; and in truth many a day she gave of peaceful quiet to her father&#x27;s livestock.When a lion attacked her father&#x27;s sheep, Cyrene wrestled with the lion and Cyrene killed that lion. Apollo, who was present, admired her bravery and skills. He fell in love with her, but wondered if it would be correct to make her his bride. But after consulting and getting an approval by Chiron, he carried her away to North Africa in his golden car. After Apollo made her the queen of the fertile and rich land, Aphrodite welcomed them both.And Aphrodite of the silver feet welcomed this guest from Delos, laying the touch of her light hand upon his god-built car, and over the sweet bliss of their bridal she spread love&#x27;s shy and winsome modesty, plighting in joint wedlock the god and maiden daughter of wide-ruling Hypseus...That very day saw the decision, and in a chamber of rich gold in Libya they lay together. There she is guardian of a city rich in beauty.In North Africa, Apollo founded the city Cyrene in the region of Cyrenaica, both named after his lover. She had two sons by Apollo: Aristaeus, the god of beekeeping, and Idmon, the Argonaut seer. Another son, Autuchus is also mentioned by Apollonuis of Rhodes. Aristaeus was entrusted to Chiron, and Idmon was brought up and educated by Apollo. After she gave birth to their sons, Apollo transformed her into a nymph, so that she could have a long life and keep hunting as much as she desired. He also helped her often by lifting her hunting nets.

In Callimachus and Acesander&#x27;s account, when Eurypylus was still ruling Libya, a monstrous lion had terrorized the citizens greatly. So Apollo brought Cyrene to get rid of the lion. After she killed the lion on the Myrtoussa (the Hill of Myrtles), Apollo stood on the same hill and showed to her the land of Libya, which she had now become the queen of.

Other version says that Cyrene had already wrestled with a lion and killed that same lion and she was tending her sheep along the marsh-meadow of the river Pineios when Apollo carried her away.

=== The bees of Aristaeus ===
Eurydice, the wife of Orpheus, died when she was bitten by a snake that she had trod upon while being pursued by Aristaeus. As a consequence of her death, all of his bees died. Desolate, he went to his mother and bemoaned his situation. Cyrene consoled her son and instructed him to seek the advice of wise Proteus. Aristaeus follows his mother&#x27;s instructions and Proteus tells him how to appease Eurydice&#x27;s soul and recover his bees.

<text>Aristaeus (; &quot;Aristaios&quot;) was the mythological culture hero credited with the discovery of many rural useful arts and handicrafts, including bee-keeping; he was the son of the huntress Cyrene and Apollo.

&quot;Aristaeus&quot; (&quot;the best&quot;) was a cult title in many places: Boeotia, Arcadia, Ceos, Sicily, Sardinia, Thessaly, and Macedonia; consequently a set of &quot;travels&quot; was imposed, connecting his epiphanies in order to account for these widespread manifestations.

If Aristaeus was a minor figure at Athens, he was more prominent in Boeotia, where he was &quot;the pastoral Apollo&quot;, and was linked to the founding myth of Thebes by marriage with Autonoë, daughter of Cadmus, the founder. Aristaeus may appear as a winged youth in painted Boeotian pottery, similar to representations of the Boreads, spirits of the North Wind. Besides Actaeon and Macris, he also was said to have fathered Charmus and Callicarpus in Sardinia.

==Pindar&#x27;s account==
According to Pindar&#x27;s ninth Pythian Ode and Apollonius&#x27; &quot;Argonautica&quot; (II.522ff), Cyrene despised spinning and other womanly arts and instead spent her days hunting and shepherding, but, in a prophecy he put in the mouth of the wise centaur Chiron, Apollo would spirit her to Libya and make her the foundress of a great city, Cyrene, in a fertile coastal plain. When Aristaeus was born, according to what Pindar sang, Hermes took him to be raised on nectar and ambrosia and to be made immortal by Gaia.

&quot;Aristaios&quot; (&quot;the best&quot;) is an epithet rather than a name:For some men to call Zeus and holy Apollo.&lt;br&gt;Agreus and Nomios, and for others Aristaios (Pindar)

==Patronage==

Thanks to a vast family tree and connections, Aristaeus is a god and patron god and protector of a wide array of rustic and rural arts, crafts, skills, practices and traditions (handicrafts)—often associated with smallholdings—some of which is overlapped with his many relatives:
* From his father, Apollo, the wise Centaur, Chiron and from his aunts, the Muses, Aristaeus learned the arts of prophecy, healing and herblore (similarly like his half-brother, Asclepius). 
* From his aunt, Artemis and from his mother, Cyrene (who was also a companion of his aunt, Artemis, either as a nymph or as a mortal princess-turned-nymph), Aristaeus learned how to track, hunt and trap animals, and how to dress and prepare their meat (Butchering) and skins (Leather making), as well as the use of nets and traps in hunting.
* From the Myrtle-nymphs (being, either Dryads or Oreads)—or the Thriae—who raised him on Apollo&#x27;s behalf, Aristaeus learned other useful arts and mysteries, such as dairying; how to prepare milk for cream, butter, oxygala (similar to yogurt) and cheese(making); how to keep chickens for their eggs; how to tame the Goddess&#x27;s bees and keep them in hives (the bees either belonging to the Myrtle nymphs themselves or the Thriae), to harness supplies of honey and beeswax, etc.; how to tame and cultivate the wild oleaster in order to make it bear olives and how to process them into olive oil (like his aunt, Athena); as such, Aristaeus is a protector of olive trees, of olive orchards/plantations, olive cultivation and of olive oil presses (whereas Athena is the goddess of olives, of olive oil and of olive-oil-making).
* Like his father, Apollo, his mother, Cyrene (a huntress and a shepherdess), his uncle, Hermes, and his cousin(?), Pan, Aristaeus is also a patron god and a protector of shepherds/herders and of herding, patron of the art of Sheep shearing, as well as the patron god of pastoralism; of the cattle and their herds and flocks, and protector of pastures.
* From his uncle, Dionysus, Aristaeus learned the processes of how to produce alcoholic beverages, such as wine, ale, beer, kykeon, mead, kumis, absinthe, etc. (although an alternate account states that &quot;he&quot; was the one who taught Dionysus, having served as a surrogate father to him on the island of Euboia, as opposed to Dionysus learning about winemaking from the wise old Satyr, Silenus); as such, Aristaeus is worshipped as a protector of grapevines, vineyards, winepresses and of viticulture, while Dionysus is the god of wine &amp; wine-making, parties, feasts, banquets &amp; festivals, and of the state of intoxication/religious ecstasy (not to be confused with Pasithea).
* From his great-aunt, Demeter, Aristaeus learned the skills of the various branches of agriculture (grain-growing), horticulture, fungiculture and animal husbandry; as such, Aristaeus was also a protector of gardens, farms, fields and orchards, etc. Some versions also credit Demeter with teaching Aristaeus leather-making, instead of his mother, Cyrene, and his aunt, Artemis.
* Aristaeus--along with Carpo of the &quot;Horae&quot; and Karpos (son of Zephyrus/Favonius and Chloris/Flora)--is also a patron god of fruit trees (Fruticulture) &amp; vegetable plants (Olericulture), herbs &amp; spices (herbiculture), edible flowers (floriculture) and fungi (Fungiculture), and a patron god of the arts foraging, hunting &amp; fishing, husbandry &amp; agriculture, and of the arts of food preservation (fermenting, pickling, brining, curing, smoking and drying of foodstuffs), and condiments (like Garum).
* From his great-aunt, Hestia, Aristaeus learned the various skills of cooking and baking, making Aristaeus a protector of Quern-stones &amp; Gristmills, Watermills, and of Ovens, such as clay-built bread ovens, etc.
* From his great-uncle, Poseidon, Aristaeus learned the skills of fishing and spearfishing, with fishing nets and fish hooks, etc.
* From his aunt, Athena (also), Aristaeus learned the skills to weave, card and hand-spin fibres into wool, thread, etc., making him the patron of ropemaking, net-making, basket weaving (see also, Wattle (construction) and Wattle and daub), and working clay and glass (also learned from Hephaestus).
* From his uncle, Hephaestus, Aristaeus learned the ways of working with metal (mining, blacksmithing and metalworking, etc.), stone (quarrying and stonemasonry, etc.), clay (pottery, ceramics and other plastic arts, also learned from Athena), glass and wood (woodworking, etc.), making Aristaeus a patron god and protector of clay Kilns, Masonry ovens and Charcoal piles, etc.
* In Ceos, Aristaeus is also a god of the Etesian winds (without being mistaken for Boreas or his brothers), which provided some respite from the intense heat of their scorching, drought-causing midsummers weather/climate.

==Issue==
When he was grown, he sailed from Libya to Boeotia, where he was inducted into further mysteries in the cave of Chiron the centaur. In Boeotia, he was married to Autonoë and became the father of the ill-fated Actaeon, who inherited the family passion for hunting, to his ruin, and of Macris, who nursed the child Dionysus.

According to Pherecydes, Aristaeus fathered Hecate, goddess of witchcraft, crossroads, and the night. Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; suggests her parents were Perses and Asteria.

==Aristaeus in Ceos==
Aristaeus&#x27; presence in Ceos, attested in the fourth and third centuries BC, was attributed to a Delphic prophecy that counselled Aristaeus to sail to Ceos, where he would be greatly honored. He found the islanders suffering from sickness under the stifling and baneful effects of the Dog-Star Sirius at its first appearance before the sun&#x27;s rising, in early July. In the foundation legend of a specifically Cean weather-magic ritual, Aristaeus was credited with the double sacrifice that countered the deadly effects of the Dog-Star, a sacrifice at dawn to Zeus Ikmaios, &quot;Rain-making Zeus&quot; at a mountaintop altar, following a pre-dawn chthonic sacrifice to Sirius, the Dog-Star, at its first annual appearance, which brought the annual relief of the cooling Etesian winds.

In a development that offered more immediate causality for the myth, Aristaeus discerned that the Ceans&#x27; troubles arose from murderers hiding in their midst, the killers of Icarius in fact. When the miscreants were found out and executed, and a shrine erected to Zeus Ikmaios, the great god was propitiated and decreed that henceforth, the Etesian wind should blow and cool all the Aegean for forty days from the baleful rising of Sirius, but the Ceans continued to propitiate the Dog-Star, just before its rising, just to be sure. Aristaeus appears on Cean coins.

Then Aristaeus, on his civilizing mission, visited Arcadia, where the winged male figure who appears on ivory tablets in the sanctuary of Ortheia as the consort of the goddess, has been identified as Aristaeus by L. Marangou.

Aristaeus settled for a time in the Vale of Tempe. By the time of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Georgics&quot;, the myth has Aristaeus chasing Eurydice when she was bitten by a serpent and died.

==Aristaeus and the bees==
Soon after Aristaeus&#x27; inadvertent hand in the death of Eurydice—whose husband, Orpheus, in one version, is Aristaeus&#x27; own half-brother, via Apollo (another version says that her husband, Orpheus, was fathered by Oeagrus)—his bees became sickened and began to die. Seeking counsel, first from his mother, Cyrene, and then from Proteus, Aristaeus learns that the bees&#x27; death was a punishment for causing the death of Eurydice, from her nymph sisters. To make amends, Aristaeus needed to sacrifice 12 animals (or four bulls and four cows) to the gods, and in memory of Eurydice, leave the carcasses in the place of sacrifice, and to return 3-days later. He followed these instructions, establishing sacrificial altars before a fountain, as advised, sacrificed the aforementioned cattle, and left their carcasses. Upon returning 3-days later, Aristaeus found within one of the carcasses new swarms of bees, which he took back to his apiary. The bees were never again troubled by disease.

A variation of this tale was told in the 2002 novel by Sue Monk Kidd, &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot;.

==&quot;Aristaeus&quot; as a name==
In later times, &quot;Aristaios&quot; was a familiar Greek name, borne by several archons of Athens and attested in inscriptions.

<doc id="78984" wikidata="Q3249389" url="?curid=78984" title="List of MPs elected in the 2001 United Kingdom general election">
<text>This is a list of members of Parliament (MPs) elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, held on 7 June. The list is arranged by constituency. New MPs elected since the general election and changes in party allegiance are noted at the bottom of the page.

Notable newcomers to the House of Commons included David Cameron, David Miliband, Boris Johnson, John Thurso, George Osborne, Nigel Dodds, Chris Grayling, Andy Burnham, Adam Price, Alistair Carmichael, Angus Robertson, Chris Bryant, Norman Lamb, and Tom Watson (many of whom would go on to reach senior positions in government and/or their respective parties).

During the 2001–05 Parliament, Michael Martin was the Speaker, Tony Blair served as Prime Minister, and William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard served as Leader of the Opposition. This Parliament was dissolved on 11 April 2005.

== By nation ==

* List of MPs for constituencies in Northern Ireland (2001–2005)
* List of MPs for constituencies in Scotland (2001–2005)
* List of MPs for constituencies in Wales (2001–2005)

== Composition ==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties in the 2001 general election.

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sat together as a party group, while Sinn Féin did not take its seats. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.

The effective government majority was slightly higher because Sinn Féin members did not take up their seats and the speaker does not vote. Speaker Michael Martin technically represented Labour in a notional majority.

== By-elections ==
There were six by-elections in the 2001–2005 Parliament. Each were in seats held by the governing Labour party, four of which were held and two won by the Liberal Democrats. Four by-elections were a result of the death of the incumbent MP.

=== Parentage ===
Ancient sources vary as to the parentage of Hecuba. According to Homer, Hecuba was the daughter of King Dymas of Phrygia, but Euripides and Virgil write of her as the daughter of the Thracian king Cisseus. The mythographers Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus leave open the question which of the two was her father, with Pseudo-Apollodorus adding a third alternative option: Hecuba&#x27;s parents could as well be the river god Sangarius and Metope.

Some versions from non-extant works are summarized by a scholiast on Euripides&#x27; &quot;Hecuba&quot;: according to those, she was a daughter of Dymas or Sangarius by the Naiad Euagora, or by Glaucippe the daughter of Xanthus (Scamander?); the possibility of her being a daughter of Cisseus is also discussed. A scholiast on Homer relates that Hecuba&#x27;s parents were either Dymas and the nymph Eunoe or Cisseus and Telecleia; the latter option would make her a full sister of Theano, which is also noted by the scholiast on Euripides cited above.

According to Suetonius in &quot;The Twelve Caesars&quot;, the emperor Tiberius pestered scholars with obscure questions about ancient mythology, with one of his favorites being &quot;Who was Hecuba&#x27;s mother?&quot;

=== Offspring ===

Hecuba had 19 children, some of which included major characters of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; such as the warriors Hector and Paris, as well as the prophetess Cassandra. Two of them, Hector and Troilus, are said to have been born as a result of Hecuba&#x27;s relationship with the god Apollo. Other named children of Hecuba by Priam are Helenus, Deiphobus, Laodice, Polyxena, Creusa, Polydorus, Polites, Antiphus, Pammon, Hipponous and Iliona.
== Myths ==

=== Hecuba in the &quot;Iliad&quot; ===

Hecuba appears six times in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In Book 6.326–96, she meets Hector upon his return to the city and offers him the libation cup, instructing him to offer it to Zeus and to drink from it himself. Taking Hector&#x27;s advice, she chooses a gown taken from Alexander&#x27;s treasure to give as an offering to the goddess and leads the Trojan women to the temple of Athena to pray for help. In Book 22, she pleads with Hector not to fight Achilles, expressing her premonition of &quot;never get[ting] to mourn you laid out on a bier.&quot; In Book 24.201–16, she is stricken with anxiety upon hearing of Priam&#x27;s plan to retrieve Hector&#x27;s body from Achilles&#x27; hut. Further along in the same episode, at 24.287–98, she offers Priam the libation cup and instructs him to pray to Zeus so that he may receive a favourable omen upon setting out towards the Achaean camp. Unlike in the first episode in which Hector refuses her offer of the cup, Priam accepts and is rewarded with the requested omen. Finally, she laments Hector&#x27;s death in a well-known speech at 24.748–59.
=== Hecuba in other classical works ===
Stesichorus states that after the sack of Troy, Apollo, Hecuba&#x27;s former lover, took her to safety and placed her in Lycia.
The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (&quot;Library&quot;) of Pseudo-Apollodorus states that Hecuba had a son named Troilus with the god Apollo. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated if Troilus reached the age of 20 alive. Troilus is killed by Achilles.

Hecuba is a main character in two plays by Euripides: &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; and &quot;Hecuba&quot;. &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; describes the aftermath of the fall of Troy, including Hecuba&#x27;s enslavement by Odysseus. &quot;Hecuba&quot; also takes place just after the fall of Troy. Polydorus, the youngest son of Priam and Hecuba, is sent to King Polymestor for safekeeping, but when Troy falls, Polymestor murders Polydorus. Hecuba learns of this, and when Polymestor comes to the fallen city, Hecuba, by trickery, blinds him and kills his two sons.

Another story says that when she was given to Odysseus as a slave, she snarled and cursed at him, so the gods turned her into a dog, allowing her to escape. Hecuba, as a dog, is later taken-in by Hecate as one of her Familiars. 

In another tradition, Hecuba went mad upon seeing the corpses of her children Polydorus and Polyxena. Dante described this episode, which he derived from Italian sources:
: &quot;E quando la fortuna volse in basso&quot;
: &quot;l&#x27;altezza de&#x27; Troian che tutto ardiva,&quot;
: &quot;sì che &#x27;nsieme col regno il re fu casso,&quot;
: &quot;Ecuba trista, misera e cattiva,&quot;
: &quot;poscia che vide Polissena morta,&quot;
: &quot;e del suo Polidoro in su la riva&quot;
: &quot;del mar si fu la dolorosa accorta,&quot;
: &quot;forsennata latrò sì come cane...&quot;

: And when fortune overturned the pride
: of the Trojans, who dared everything, so that
: both the king and his kingdom were destroyed,
: Poor wretched captured Hecuba,
: after she saw her Polyxena dead
: and found her Polydorus on the beach,
: was driven mad by sorrow
: and began barking like a dog...
:—&quot;Inferno&quot; XXX: 13–20

Another legend has it that Hecuba threw herself into the sea and was transformed into &quot;a she-dog with fiery eyes&quot; and that she was buried in a &quot;wretched&quot; place called Kynosema (&#x27;dog&#x27;s grave&#x27;), a &quot;landmark for sailors&quot;. The Kynosema is said to be a promontory located in modern day Kilidülbahir. According to Lycophron, she was rescued by the goddess Hecate and became one of her canine familiars.

<doc id="78987" wikidata="Q750236" url="?curid=78987" title="Polyxena">
<text>In Greek mythology, Polyxena (; ) was the youngest daughter of King Priam of Troy and his queen, Hecuba. She does not appear in Homer, but in several other classical authors, though the details of her story vary considerably. After the fall of Troy, she dies when sacrificed by the Greeks on the tomb of Achilles, to whom she had been betrothed and in whose death she was complicit in many versions.

== Description ==
Polyxena was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the &quot;Chronography&quot; as &quot;tall, pure, very white, large-eyed, black-haired, with her hair worn long behind, a good nose and cheeks, blooming-lipped, small-footed, virgin, charming, very beautiful, 18 years old when they killed her&quot;. Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian, she was illustrated as &quot;. . .fair, tall, and beautiful. Her neck was slender, her eyes lovely her hair blonde and long, her body well-proportioned, her fingers tapering, her legs straight, and her feet the best. Surpassing all the others in beauty, she remained a completely ingenuous and kind-hearted woman.&quot;

==Myth==
Polyxena is considered the Trojan version of Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra. She is not in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, appearing in works by later poets. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated if Polyxena&#x27;s brother, Prince Troilus, reached the age of twenty. During the Trojan War, Polyxena and Troilus were ambushed when they were attempting to fetch water from a fountain, and Troilus was killed by the Greek warrior Achilles, who soon became interested in the quiet sagacity of Polyxena.

Achilles, still recovering from Patroclus&#x27; death, found Polyxena&#x27;s words a comfort and was later told to go to the temple of Apollo to meet her after her devotions. Achilles seemed to trust Polyxena—he told her of his only vulnerability: his vulnerable heel. It was later in the temple of Apollo that Polyxena&#x27;s brothers, Paris and Deiphobus, ambushed Achilles and shot him in the heel with an arrow steeped in poison; one supposedly guided by the hand of Apollo himself.

==Sacrifice of Polyxena==
Some claimed Polyxena committed suicide after Achilles&#x27; death out of guilt. According to Euripides, however, in his plays &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; and &quot;Hecuba&quot;, Polyxena&#x27;s famous death was caused at the end of the Trojan War. Achilles&#x27; ghost had come back to the Greeks to demand the human sacrifice of Polyxena so as to appease the wind needed to set sail back to Hellas. She was to be killed at the foot of Achilles&#x27; grave. Hecuba, Polyxena&#x27;s mother, expressed despair at the death of another of her daughters. (Polyxena was killed after almost all of her brothers and sisters.)

However, Polyxena was eager to die as a sacrifice to Achilles rather than live as a slave. She reassured her mother, and refused to beg before Odysseus or be treated in any way other than a princess. She asked that Odysseus reassure her mother as she is led away. Polyxena&#x27;s virginity was critical to the honor of her character, and she was described as dying bravely as the son of Achilles, Neoptolemus, slit her throat: she arranged her clothing around her carefully so that she was fully covered when she died.“The whole crowd of the Achaean army was there &quot;en masse&quot; before the tomb for the slaughter of your girl.  The son of Achilles then took Polyxena by the hand and made her stand on the top of the mound.  And I was near by.  Picked young men selected from the Achaeans attended, to hold down your poor girl if she struggled.  Then Achilles’ son took a full goblet all of gold in his hands and raised on high the libation for his dead father.  He signaled to me to call for silence from the whole Achaean army.  And I stood up in the middle and said these words: ‘Silence, Achaeans, let the whole host be silent!  Silence!  Not a word!’ And I hushed the crowd to stillness.  and he said, ‘O son of Peleus, my father, receive from me this libation which summons up the dead, and be appeased.  Come, so that you may drink a virgin’s pure dark blood which the army and I give to you.  Show yourself well disposed towards us and grant that we may untie the ropes which hold our ships’ sterns fast, meet with a favorable return from Troy and, all of us, reach our native land.’ That was what he said, and the whole army prayed after him.  Then, seizing his sword of solid gold by the hilt, he started to draw it from its sheath, and with a nod he signaled to the young men picked from the Greek army to take hold of the girl.  But when she saw this, she spoke out these words: ‘Argives, you who have sacked my city, I am happy to die.  Let no one lay a hand on my body, I shall offer my neck with good courage.  By the gods, leave me free when you kill me so that I can die a free woman!  I am a princess and it would shame me to bear the name of slave among the dead.’  The host roared their approval and king Agamemnon told the young men to let the maiden go… When she heard this order of the master, she took hold of her dress and tore it from the top of her shoulder to the middle of her waist by the navel.  Her lovely breasts and bosom were revealed like a statue’s, and sinking to her knees upon the ground she spoke the most heart-rending words of all: “Look at me!  If you are eager to strike this bosom, young Neoptolemus, strike it now – or if you want to cut into my neck, here is my throat all ready.’ In his pity for the girl, he wavered between reluctance and eagerness, but then he cut her windpipe with his sword.  Springs of blood welled forth.  But even though she was dying, she nonetheless took great care to fall modestly, hiding what should be hidden from men’s eyes.”

===In classical art===

A few examples in Greek imagery can be securely identified as depicting the sacrifice of Polyxena. Most show Polyxena sacrificed over the tomb of Achilles. However, some details in the pictorial evidence of the sacrifice hint at varying and perhaps earlier versions of the story.

For instance, some images appear to show Polyxena sacrificed over an altar, rather than a tomb, and one sarcophagus relief, from Gümüşçay, the Polyxena sarcophagus, dated to c. 500 BC shows a tripod placed next to the tomb. These details have been interpreted as indicating an association between the burial mound of Achilles and sacred ground dedicated to Apollo.

===Post-classical art===
There was a trickle of images in medieval and Renaissance art, often as illustrations to Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;De mulieribus claris&quot;. Primaticcio painted it in the Chateau of Fontainebleau (1541–47). But the subject became more popular in the Baroque, often paired with the Continence of Scipio. Pietro da Cortona &quot;established his reputation&quot; with a large painting in 1625 (now Pinacoteca Capitolina, 2.17 × 4.19 m).
Examples include paintings by Giovanni Francesco Romanelli and by Charles Le Brun (1647), both in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Sebastiano Ricci planned a large painting in the 1720s, but never got beyond studies. The 18th-century Venetian painter Giovanni Battista Pittoni was especially keen on the subject, painting at least nine versions of four compositions.

Most versions show Polyxena going to her death in a dignified manner, though often with her breasts bared. The sacrifice may be performed by a priest, or Neoptolemus. As in Ricci&#x27;s versions, Achilles&#x27; tomb may have an equestrian statue of him above it, and Agamemnon, who opposed the killing, may be present expressing dissent. Sometimes the ghost of Achilles hovers in the air nearby.

The statue &quot;The Rape of Polyxena&quot; by Pio Fedi (1855–1865) is very prominently displayed in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence. The name does not refer to sexual rape, but to an earlier definition of the word derived from the Latin (supine stem &quot;raptum&quot;), &quot;to snatch, to grab, to carry off&quot;. Thus, the statue shows Polyxena&#x27;s taking to be killed by Neoptolemus, despite the protests of her mother Hecuba, seated. The body on the ground, somewhat anachronistically, is either her brother Polites, or possibly Hector. In most versions, both were killed much earlier, and buried by that point in the various stories.

==On the stage==
The story of Polyxena features in &quot;Hecuba&quot; by Euripides, &quot;Troades&quot; by Seneca and the &quot;Polyxena&quot; of Sophocles, of which only a few fragments remain.
Apart from these classical dramas, there are:
*&quot;Achille et Polyxène&quot;, an opera begun by Jean-Baptiste Lully, who died from a conducting injury having only completed the first act. It was completed by his pupil Pascal Collasse, and premiered in Paris in 1687.
*&quot;Polixène&quot;, an opera by the French composer Antoine Dauvergne, first performed at the Paris Opéra on 11 January 1763
*Polyxena is also a character in &quot;Les Troyens&quot; by Hector Berlioz.
*She is mentioned by William Shakespeare in &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; III,3,207-215 and V,1.40-43.

<text>In Greek mythology, Phlegyas (; Ancient Greek: Φλεγύας means &#x27;fiery&#x27;) was a king of the Lapiths (or the Phlegyans).

==Family==
Phlegyas was the son of Ares and Chryse, daughter of Halmus, or of Dotis. In one account, he was mentioned as an autochthon. Phlegyas was the brother of Ixion, another king of the Lapiths, and Gyrton, eponym of a Thessalian town.

Phlegyas was the father of Ixion, in some accounts, as well as Coronis, one of Apollo&#x27;s lovers. The girl&#x27;s mother was called Cleopheme, daughter of Malus and the Muse Erato. According to one tradition, he had no children. Another daughter, Gyrtone, was also said to have given her name to Gyrton.

==Mythology==
Phlegyas succeeded Eteocles, who died without issue, in the government of the district of Orchomenos, which he named Phlegyantis, after himself.

While pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus. When a hooded crow informed Apollo of the affair, he sent his sister Artemis to kill Coronis, unable to perform the task himself. However, Hermes rescued the baby from Coronis&#x27; womb and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise. Phlegyas, angry at Apollo for killing his daughter, torched the Apollonian temple at Delphi, causing Apollo to kill him with his arrows and condemn him to severe punishment in the lower world. In another version of the myth, Phlegyas had no children and the two brothers Lycus and Nycteus are responsible for his death.

In the &quot;Aeneid&quot; of Virgil, Phlegyas is shown tormented in Tartarus in the Underworld, warning others not to despise the gods. In the &quot;Thebaid&quot; of Statius, Phlegyas is also shown to be in the Underworld entombed in a rock by Megaera (one of the Furies) and starved in front of an eternal feast (comparable to the torment of Tantalus).

==Other appearances==
* In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; poem &quot;Inferno&quot;, Phlegyas ferries Virgil and Dante across the River Styx which is portrayed as a marsh where the wrathful and sullen lie within Hell&#x27;s Circle of Wrath.
* Phlegyas appears in the video game &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;. This version is a giant fiery rock monster: whether he has always been is unknown. Dante unknowingly rides across the Styx on the wrathful demigod&#x27;s crown. After fighting his way towards Dis and seeing Beatrice become Lucifer&#x27;s bride, Dante takes control of Phlegyas and uses him to break into the City of Dis. When Dante reaches the circle of Heresy, Phlegyas breaks the ground he&#x27;s standing on. Dante manages to jump off in time, but Phlegyas breaks through the floor and plummets into the abyss.
** In the animated film based on the video game called &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno: An Animated Epic&quot;, the appearance of Phlegyas (whose vocal effects are provided by Kevin Michael Richardson) is more toned down as he appears in the film as a green-skinned humanoid who willingly took Dante and Virgil through the fifth circle of Hell without incident. He was knocked out by Lucifer when Dante controlled Phlegyas to charge Lucifer.

<text>There are several characters in Greek mythology by the name Coronis (Ancient Greek: Κορωνίς, -ίδος &quot;crow&quot; or &quot;raven&quot;, among others). These include:

* Coronis, one of the Hyades.
* Corone, a daughter of King Coronaeus of Phocis who fled from Poseidon and was changed into a crow by Athena.
* Coronis, a Maenad who was raped by Butes of Thrace. Dionysus made the offender throw himself down a well.
* Coronis, who was in one version the mother of the Graces by Dionysus. She may be the same with the above character.
* Coronis, daughter of Phlegyas, king of the Lapiths, was one of Apollo&#x27;s lovers and mother of Asclepius.
* Coronis, one of the sacrificial victims of Minotaur.

A coronis may also be:
* A vessel with raised ends, like a crescent.

<text>There were several figures named Elatus or Élatos (Ancient Greek: Ἔλατος means &quot;ductile&quot;) in Greek mythology.

* Elatus, a son of Arcas by either Leaneira (or Laodameia), Meganeira, Chrysopeleia or Erato and the brother of Apheidas and Azan. He was allotted by Arcas the region of then-nameless Mount Cyllene as his domain, but afterwards migrated to the region which later became known as Phocis, and assisted the local inhabitants in the war against the Phlegyans; he was renowned as founder and eponym of the city Elatea. An image of him was carved on a stele in the marketplace of Elatea. He married Laodice (daughter of Cinyras) and became by her, the father of Stymphalus, Pereus, Aepytus, Ischys, and Cyllen.
*Elatus, a Lapith chieftain of Larissa, Thessaly. He was the father, by Hippeia, of Caeneus, Polyphemus, the seer Ampycus, Ischys who was beloved by Coronis, and a daughter Dotia, possibly the eponym of Dotion (Dotium) in Thessaly (see also Dotis).
*Elatus, a centaur, killed during a battle with Heracles by a poisoned arrow that passed through his arm and continued to wound Chiron in the knee.
** The minor planet 31824 Elatus is named after this figure.
*Elatus or Elaton, a charioteer of Amphiaraus, otherwise known as Baton.
*Elatus, father of Euanippe, who was the mother of Polydorus by Hippomedon.
*Elatus, a son of Icarius and father of Taenarus by Erymede, daughter of Damasiclus. In one account, Taenarus was instead called the child of Icarius with no mention of the birth mother.
*Elatus, an ally of the Trojans from Pedasus, killed by Agamemnon.
*Elatus, one of the suitors of Penelope from Same along with other 22 wooers. He was slain by Emaeus during the assault of Odysseus.

Ischys had an affair with the Thessalian princess Coronis, one of Apollo&#x27;s lovers, who was at that time pregnant with the god&#x27;s child. When a (then white) raven told Apollo of the affair between Ischys and Coronis, he became so angry that his intense glare scorched the raven black. His twin sister Artemis killed Coronis as a punishment, but the unborn child was saved at the last minute by Apollo who felt remorse for causing his lover&#x27;s death. Ischys was then killed by Apollo&#x27;s father Zeus or Apollo himself.

The mortal lover of Coronis was also known as Alcyoneus or Lycus.

<text>Asclepius (; &quot;Asklēpiós&quot; ; ) is a hero and god of medicine in ancient Greek religion and mythology. He is the son of Apollo and Coronis, or Arsinoe, or of Apollo alone. Asclepius represents the healing aspect of the medical arts; his daughters, the &quot;Asclepiades&quot;, are: Hygieia (&quot;Health, Healthiness&quot;), Iaso (from ἴασις &quot;healing, recovering, recuperation&quot;, the goddess of recuperation from illness), Aceso (from ἄκεσις &quot;healing&quot;, the goddess of the healing process), Aegle (the goddess of good health) and Panacea (the goddess of universal remedy). He has several sons as well. He was associated with the Roman/Etruscan god Vediovis and the Egyptian Imhotep. The rod of Asclepius, a snake-entwined staff similar to the caduceus, remains a symbol of medicine today. Those physicians and attendants who served this god were known as the Therapeutae of Asclepius.

== Etymology ==
The etymology of the name is unknown. In his revised version of Frisk&#x27;s &quot;Griechisches etymologisches Wörterbuch&quot; (&quot;Greek Etymological Dictionary&quot;), R. S. P. Beekes gives this summary of the different attempts:

:&quot;H. Grégoire (with R. Goossens and M. Mathieu) in &quot;Asklépios, Apollon Smintheus et Rudra&quot; 1949 (Mém. Acad. Roy. de Belgique. Cl. d. lettres. 2. sér. 45), explains the name as &quot;the mole-hero&quot;, connecting &#x27;mole&#x27; and refers to the resemblance of the Tholos in Epidauros and the building of a mole. (Thus Puhvel, &quot;Comp. Mythol&quot;. 1987, 135.) But the variants of Asklepios and those of the word for &quot;mole&quot; do not agree.

:The name is typical for Pre-Greek words; apart from minor variations ( for , for ) we find (a well known variation; Fur. 335–339) followed by or , i.e. a voiced velar (without ) or a voiceless velar (or an aspirated one: we know that there was no distinction between the three in the substr. language) with a . I think that the renders an original affricate, which (prob. as ) was lost before the (in Greek the group is rare, and certainly before another consonant).

:Szemerényi&#x27;s etymology (&quot;JHS&quot; 94, 1974, 155) from Hitt. &quot;assula(a)-&quot; &quot;well-being&quot; and &quot;piya-&quot; &quot;give&quot; cannot be correct, as it does not explain the velar.&quot;

Beekes suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form &quot;*(a)-syklap-&quot;.

His name may mean &quot;to cut open&quot; from a story about his birth.

==Epithets==
He shared with Apollo the epithet &quot;Paean&quot; (&quot;the Healer&quot;). He was called &quot;Aulonius&quot;, derived from a temple he had in Aulon, a valley in ancient Messenia.

== Mythology ==
=== Birth ===
Asclepius was the son of Apollo and, according to the earliest accounts, a mortal woman named Koronis (Coronis), who was a princess of Tricca in Thessaly. When she displayed infidelity by sleeping with a mortal named Ischys, Apollo found out with his prophetic powers and killed Ischys. Coronis was killed by Artemis for being unfaithful to Apollo and was laid out on a funeral pyre to be consumed, but Apollo rescued the child by cutting him from Coronis&#x27; womb.

According to Delphian tradition, Asclepius was born in the temple of Apollo, with Lachesis acting as a midwife and Apollo relieving the pains of Coronis. Apollo named the child after Coronis&#x27; nickname, Aegle.

Phoenician tradition maintains that Asclepius was born of Apollo without any woman involved.

According to the Roman version, Apollo, having learned about Coronis&#x27; betrayal with the mortal Ischys through his raven Lycius, killed her with his arrows. Before breathing her last, she revealed to Apollo that she was pregnant with his child. He repented his actions and unsuccessfully tried to save her. At last, he removed their son safely from her belly before she was consumed by the fire.

In yet another version, Coronis who was already pregnant with Apollo&#x27;s child, had to accompany her father to Peloponnesos. She had kept her pregnancy hidden from her father. In Epidaurus, she bore a son and exposed him on a mountain called &quot;Tittheion&quot; (from τίτθη &quot;wet nurse&quot;, τιτθεύω &quot;to suckle, breastfeed&quot;). The child was given milk by one of the goats that pastured about the mountain, and was guarded by the watch-dog of the herd. Aresthanas, the owner of goats and the guard dogs found the child. As he came near, he saw lightning that flashed from the child, and thinking of it to be a sign of the divine, he left the child alone. Asclepius was later taken by Apollo.

According to Strabo and other traditions, the birthplace of Asclepius is considered to be Tricca (modern Trikala city in Thessaly).

=== Education and adventures ===
Apollo named the rescued baby &quot;Asclepius&quot; and reared him for a while and taught him many things about medicine. However, like his half-brother, Aristaeus, Asclepius had his formal education under the centaur Chiron who instructed him in the art of medicine.

It is said that in return for some kindness rendered by Asclepius, a snake licked Asclepius&#x27;s ears clean and taught him secret knowledge (to the Greeks snakes were sacred beings of wisdom, healing, and resurrection). Asclepius bore a rod wreathed with a snake, which became associated with healing. Another version states that when Asclepius (or in another myth Polyidus) was commanded to restore the life of Glaucus, he was confined in a secret prison. While pondering on what he should do, a snake crept near his staff. Lost in his thoughts, Asclepius unknowingly killed it by hitting it again and again with his staff. Later, another snake came there with an herb in its mouth, and placed it on the head of a dead snake, which soon came back to life. Seeing this, Asclepius used the same herb, which brought Glaucus back. A species of non-venomous pan-Mediterranean serpent, the Aesculapian snake (&quot;Zamenis longissimus&quot;) is named for the god.

He was originally called Hepius but received his popular name of Asclepius after he cured Ascles, ruler of Epidaurus who suffered an incurable ailment in his eyes. Asclepius became so proficient as a healer that he surpassed both Chiron and his father, Apollo. Asclepius was therefore able to evade death and to bring others back to life from the brink of death and beyond. This caused an excessive abundance of human beings, and Zeus resorted to killing him to maintain balance in the numbers of the human population.

At some point, Asclepius was among those who took part in the Calydonian Boar hunt. Also, he was one of the Argonauts.

===Marriage and family===
Asclepius was married to Epione, with whom he had five daughters: Hygieia, Panacea, Aceso, Iaso, and Aegle, and three sons: Machaon, Podaleirios and Telesphoros. He also sired a son, Aratus, with Aristodeme.

=== Death and immortality===
Asclepius once started bringing back to life the dead people like Tyndareus, Capaneus, Glaucus, Hymenaeus, Lycurgus and others. Others say he brought Hippolytus back from the dead on Artemis&#x27;s request, and accepted gold for it, or maybe he did it for love. It is the only mention of Asclepius resurrecting the dead. In all other accounts he is said to use his skills simply as a physician.

However, Hades accused Asclepius of stealing his subjects and complained to his brother Zeus about it. According to others, Zeus was afraid that Asclepius would teach the art of resurrection to other humans as well. Concerning the fate of Asclepius, Ovid writes that &quot;the youth [Asclepius] blasted by ancestral bolts [of Zeus] soars from earth [rising as the constellation Ophiuchus] and flings his hands coiled with double snakes.&quot; Later accounts read &quot;The Serpent-Holder. Many astronomers have imagined that he is Aesculapius [Asclepius], whom Jupiter [Zeus], for the sake of Apollo, put among the stars.&quot; Asclepius was killed by Zeus, and by Apollo&#x27;s request, was subsequently immortalized as a star.

== Sacred places and practices ==
The most ancient and the most prominent asclepeion (or healing temple) according to the geographer of the 1st century BC, Strabo, was situated in Trikala. The 1st century AD Pool of Bethesda, described in the Gospel of John, chapter 5, was found by archaeologists in 1964 to be part of an asclepeion. One of the most famous temples of Asclepius was at Epidaurus in north-eastern Peloponnese, dated to the fourth century BC. Another famous asclepeion was built approximately a century later on the island of Kos, where Hippocrates, the legendary &quot;father of medicine&quot;, may have begun his career. Other asclepieia were situated in Gortys (in Arcadia), and Pergamum in Asia.

From the fifth century BC onwards, the cult of Asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples (Asclepieia) to be cured of their ills. Ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god (according to means), and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary– the abaton (or adyton). Any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation. Some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners. In honor of Asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes—the Aesculapian Snakes—slithered around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. These snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of Asclepius throughout the classical world.

The original Hippocratic Oath began with the invocation &quot;I swear by Apollo the Physician and by Asclepius and by Hygieia and Panacea and by all the gods ...&quot;.

&quot;Epidauria&quot; (τὰ Ἐπιδαύρια) was a festival at Athens in honour of Asclepius.

Some later religious movements claimed links to Asclepius. In the 2nd century AD the controversial miracle-worker Alexander claimed that his god Glycon, a snake with a &quot;head of linen&quot; was an incarnation of Asclepius. The Greek language rhetorician and satirist Lucian produced the work Alexander the False Prophet to denounce the swindler for future generations. He described Alexander as having a character &quot;made up of lying, trickery, perjury, and malice; [it was] facile, audacious, venturesome, diligent in the execution of its schemes, plausible, convincing, masking as good, and wearing an appearance absolutely opposite to its purpose.&quot; In Rome, the College of Aesculapius and Hygia was an association &quot;(collegium)&quot; that served as a burial society and dining club that also participated in the Imperial cult.

The botanical genus &quot;Asclepias&quot; (commonly known as milkweed) is named after him and includes the medicinal plant &quot;A. tuberosa&quot; or &quot;Pleurisy root&quot;.

Asclepius was depicted on the reverse of the Greek 10,000 drachmas banknote of 1995–2001.

At the city of Miletus, archaeologists discovered a cave under the city&#x27;s theatre which was associated with Asclepius cult.

At Hyperteleatum, Hypsi and Hyettus there were temples of Asclepius.

<doc id="79000" wikidata="Q1230688" url="?curid=79000" title="Pyramus and Thisbe">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pyramus and Thisbe () are a pair of ill-fated lovers from Babylon, whose story is best known from Ovid&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. The tragic myth has been retold by many authors.

Pyramus and Thisbe&#x27;s parents, driven by rivalry, forbade their union, but they communicated through a crack in the wall between their houses. They planned to meet under a mulberry tree, but a series of tragic misunderstandings led to their deaths: Thisbe fled from a lioness, leaving her cloak behind, which Pyramus found and mistook as evidence of her death. Believing Thisbe was killed by the lioness, Pyramus committed suicide, staining the mulberry fruits with his blood. Thisbe, upon finding Pyramus dead, also killed herself. The gods changed the color of the mulberry fruits to honor their forbidden love.

Ovid&#x27;s version is the oldest surviving account, but the story is likely to have originated from earlier myths in Cilicia. The tale has been adapted in various forms, inspiring works such as Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, as well as modern adaptations in literature, opera, and popular culture. The story is depicted in works of art from ancient Roman mosaics to Renaissance paintings.

== Mythology ==
=== Ovid ===
Pyramus and Thisbe are two lovers in the city of Babylon who occupy connected houses. Their respective parents, driven by rivalry, forbid them to wed. Through a crack in one of the walls they whisper their love for each other. They arrange to meet near a tomb under a mulberry tree and state their feelings for each other. Thisbe arrives first, but upon seeing a lioness with a bloody mouth from a recent kill, she flees, leaving behind her cloak. When Pyramus arrives, he is horrified at the sight of Thisbe&#x27;s cloak: the lioness had torn it and left traces of blood behind, as well as its tracks. Assuming that a wild beast had killed her, Pyramus kills himself, falling on his sword, a typical Babylonian way to commit suicide, and in turn splashing blood on the white mulberry leaves. Pyramus&#x27; blood stains the white mulberry fruits, turning them dark. Thisbe returns, eager to tell Pyramus what had happened to her, but she finds Pyramus&#x27; dead body under the shade of the mulberry tree. Thisbe, after praying to their parents and the gods to have them buried together and a brief period of mourning, stabs herself with the same sword. In the end, the gods listen to Thisbe&#x27;s lament, and forever change the colour of the mulberry fruits into the stained colour to honor forbidden love. Pyramus and Thisbe are models of love that is faithful to the very end.

=== Origins and other versions ===
Ovid&#x27;s is the oldest surviving version of the story, published in 8 AD, but he adapted an existing aetiological myth. While in Ovid&#x27;s telling Pyramus and Thisbe lived in Babylon, and Ctesias had placed the tomb of his imagined king Ninus near that city, the myth probably originated in Cilicia (part of Ninus&#x27; Babylonian empire) as Pyramos is the historical Greek name of the local Ceyhan River. The metamorphosis in the primary story involves Pyramus changing into this river and Thisbe into a nearby spring. A 2nd-century mosaic unearthed near Nea Paphos on Cyprus depicts this older version of the myth. This alternative version also survives in the &quot;progymnasmata&quot;, a work by Nicolaus Sophista, a Greek sophist and rhetor who lived during the fifth century AD.

==Adaptations==

The story of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; appears in Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;On Famous Women&quot; as biography number twelve (sometimes thirteen) and in his &quot;Decameron&quot;, in the fifth story on the seventh day, where a desperate housewife falls in love with her neighbor, and communicates with him through a crack in the wall, attracting his attention by dropping pieces of stone and straw through the crack.

In the 1380s, Geoffrey Chaucer, in his &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot;, and John Gower, in his &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;, were the first to tell the story in English. Gower altered the story somewhat into a cautionary tale. John Metham&#x27;s &quot;Amoryus and Cleopes&quot; (1449) is another early English adaptation.

The tragedy of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ultimately sprang from Ovid&#x27;s story. Here the star-crossed lovers cannot be together because Juliet has been engaged by her parents to another man and the two families hold an ancient grudge. As in Pyramus and Thisbe, the mistaken belief in one lover&#x27;s death leads to consecutive suicides. The earliest version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was published in 1476 by Masuccio Salernitano, while it mostly obtained its present form when written down in 1524 by Luigi da Porto. Salernitano and Da Porto both are thought to have been inspired by Ovid and Boccaccio&#x27;s writing. Shakespeare&#x27;s most famous 1590s adaptation is a dramatization of Arthur Brooke&#x27;s 1562 poem &quot;The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet&quot;, itself a translation of a French translation of Da Porto&#x27;s novella.

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (Act V, sc 1), a comedy written in the 1590s, a group of &quot;mechanicals&quot; enact the story of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;. Their production is crude and, for the most part, badly done until the final monologues of Nick Bottom, as Pyramus and Francis Flute, as Thisbe. The theme of forbidden love is also present in the main plot of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (albeit in a less tragic and dark representation) in that a girl, Hermia, is not able to marry the man she loves, Lysander, because her father Egeus despises him and wishes for her to marry Demetrius, and meanwhile Hermia and Lysander are confident that Helena is in love with Demetrius.

The Beatles performed a humorous performance of &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot; on the 1964 television special &quot;Around the Beatles&quot;. Primarily based around William Shakespeare&#x27;s adaptation, the performance featured Paul McCartney as Pyramus, John Lennon as his lover Thisbe, George Harrison as Moonshine, and Ringo Starr as Lion, with Trevor Peacock in the role of Quince.

Spanish poet Luis de Góngora wrote a &quot;Fábula de Píramo y Tisbe&quot; in 1618, while French poet Théophile de Viau wrote &quot;Les amours tragiques de Pyrame et Thisbée&quot;, a tragedy in five acts, in 1621.

In 1718 Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello wrote his only opera, &quot;La Tisbe&quot;, for Württemberg court. François Francoeur and François Rebel composed &quot;Pirame et Thisbé&quot;, a lyric tragedy in five acts and a prologue, with libretto by Jean-Louis-Ignace de La Serre; it was played at the Académie royale de musique, on October 17, 1726. The story was adapted by John Frederick Lampe as a &quot;Mock Opera&quot; in 1745, containing a singing &quot;Wall&quot; which was described as &quot;the most musical partition that was ever heard.&quot; In 1768 in Vienna, Johann Adolph Hasse composed a serious opera on the tale, titled &quot;Piramo e Tisbe&quot;.

Edmond Rostand adapted the tale, making the fathers of the lovers conspire to bring their children together by pretending to forbid their love, in &quot;Les Romanesques&quot;, whose 1960 musical adaptation, &quot;The Fantasticks,&quot; became the world&#x27;s longest-running musical.

Pyramus and Thisbe were featured in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2012 episode &quot;The Daughter Also Rises&quot;. Nick and Lisa&#x27;s misunderstood love was compared to Thisbe and Pyramus&#x27; forbidden love. Much like the crack in the wall, Lisa and Nick met through a crack between two booths in an Italian restaurant. Lisa and Nick are portrayed as the two characters during a later portion of the episode. They go to finish off their story and head for the tree under which Pyramus and Thisbe&#x27;s fate presented itself.

Bolu Babalola adapted the story of Pyramus and Thisbe in her 2020 anthology &quot;Love in Color: Mythical Tales from Around the World, Retold.&quot; In this version Pyramus and Thisbe are college students living next door to each other in an old college dorm with a crack in the wall. Unlike in the original myth, their story ends with them happily together.

<text>Calabasas (, ; Spanish for &quot;squashes&quot;) is a city in the southwestern region of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles County, California, United States. Situated between the foothills of the Santa Monica and Santa Susana mountains, northwest of downtown Los Angeles, Calabasas has a population of 22,491 (as of July 1, 2022).

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Calabasas&quot; is an archaic Californio variant spelling of the Spanish word &quot;calabazas&quot;, meaning &quot;winter squashes&quot; (the area abounds in wild squashes). The Spanish botanist Jose Longinos Martinez recorded &quot;Las Calabazas&quot; as a place name in 1792.

==History==
The San Fernando Valley has been inhabited by the Chumash and Tongva for thousands of years. Spanish explorers were the first Europeans to set foot on the land. In 1770, an expedition headed by Gaspar de Portolá crossed the area while returning to Mexico from Northern California. In 1776, a northbound party of explorers led by Juan Bautista de Anza camped there on its way from Mexico.

&quot;Calabasas&quot; was the name given to a ranchería in the Los Angeles area in 1795. The Leonis Adobe, in Old Town Calabasas, dates back to 1844 and is one of the oldest existing buildings in greater Los Angeles. The city was incorporated on April 5, 1991, making it the newest city in Los Angeles County.

====Claretville of Calabasas / King Gillette Ranch====
The Claretians (The Missionary Sons of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Rome, or The Claretian Order) of the Catholic Church had come to Southern California by way of Mexico in the early 1900s, working in Los Angeles inner-city missions. From 1952 to 1977, they operated the Theological Seminary of Claretville and the Immaculate Heart Claretian Novitiate on the former Gillette Estate, which they renamed Claretville. Thomas Aquinas College rented the Claretville campus from the Claretians from 1971 to 1978. When the Claretians sold their Claretville property in 1978 to Clare Prophet and her Church Universal and Triumphant, Thomas Aquinas College began construction on a permanent campus in Santa Paula, California. The Gillette Estate/Claretville property is known as the King Gillette Ranch and is part of Malibu Creek State Park. The land and historic structures by architect Wallace Neff are at the intersection of Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes Road in unincorporated Calabasas.

The Malibu Hindu Temple, located on Las Virgenes Road in unincorporated Calabasas, is visited by many Hindus and others from both in and outside California. The Hindu Temple Society of Southern California was incorporated in the State of California as a nonprofit religious organization on August 18, 1977.

==Government==
City policies are enacted by a five-member city council. Council members serve overlapping four-year terms and are elected at-large, on a non-partisan basis. Each year, the council selects one of its members to act as mayor and preside over city council meetings; a mayor pro tempore is also selected at this time, to serve for one year, concurrent to the mayoral term. While the mayor has additional responsibilities/duties, the mayor is not vested with any additional administrative authority.

The City of Calabasas uses a council-manager model of local government. The city council is primarily responsible for legislative, financial, and political matters, while an appointed city manager serves as the city&#x27;s chief executive. The city manager is primarily responsible for managing day-to-day operations and providing general oversight. The city manager is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the city council.

In 2005, Calabasas voters overwhelmingly passed Measure D. The ordinance protects and preserves existing areas of open space in Calabasas by requiring two-thirds voter approval before any land in the city designated as open space may be redesignated for another use.

In 2007, the Calabasas City Council adopted Ordinance 2007–233, banning retail food establishments, nonprofit food providers, and city facilities from using food-packaging materials made of expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam). The ordinance requires food-service establishments in Calabasas to use environmentally acceptable packaging starting March 31, 2008, and to report ongoing compliance with this ordinance on the first business day of each calendar year.

In 2011, the City Council passed Ordinance 2011-282 which banned grocery stores, convenience stores (minimarts), liquor stores, drug stores, and pharmacies from furnishing single-use plastic carryout bags. The ordinance also requires that if those businesses furnish paper carryout bags, they must charge customers 10 cents per bag.

===Second-hand smoke ordinance===
In February 2006, Calabasas enacted the Comprehensive Second-Hand Smoke Control Ordinance that prohibits smoking in all public places in the City of Calabasas where other persons may be exposed to second-hand smoke. These places include indoor and outdoor businesses, hotels, parks, apartment common areas, restaurants, and bars where people can be reasonably expected to congregate or meet. Under the law, smoking outdoors in public areas within the city is restricted to select &quot;designated smoking areas&quot;. The law went into effect on March 16, 2006, garnering much local and national media attention. The full text of the ordinance may be found at Calabasas&#x27; official website. The ordinance was expanded in early 2008, requiring 80% of rental apartment buildings to be permanently designated as non-smoking units by January 1, 2012.

==Education==
Calabasas residents are zoned to schools in the Las Virgenes Unified School District. The district also serves the nearby communities of Agoura Hills, Bell Canyon, and Hidden Hills, and certain smaller areas. Calabasas High School is a part of the district.

In January 2004, Alice C. Stelle Middle School, located at the corner of Mulholland Highway and Paul Revere Road, was opened to serve the eastern half of the city. The western half is served by Arthur E. Wright Middle School, located on Las Virgenes Road, which prior to 2004, was the city&#x27;s only middle school.

Calabasas is also home to Chaparral, Round Meadow, Lupin Hill, and Bay Laurel public elementary schools, which are part of the Las Virgenes Unified School District, as well as the private Viewpoint School.

It augments the service provided by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and funds its own municipal library (as opposed to participating in the Los Angeles County library system), runs the Calabasas Tennis and Swim Center, Creekside Klubhouse, public parks, and has a protected and maintained historical district called &quot;Old Town Calabasas&quot;.

Calabasas has two branches of the United States Postal Service, located in Suite 10 at 4774 Park Granada and at the Malibu Shell Post Office at 4807 Las Virgenes Road.

<text>In Greek mythology, Chrysaor (, gen. ), &quot;he who has a golden sword&quot; (from &quot;golden&quot; and &quot;sword&quot;]) was the brother of the winged horse Pegasus, often depicted as a young man, the son of Poseidon and Medusa, born when Perseus decapitated the Gorgon Medusa. 
==Mythology==
In Greek mythology, Medusa was one of the Gorgons, three monstrous siblings. Medusa, unlike her sisters Stheno and Euryale, was mortal, and was beheaded by Perseus. Chrysaor and Pegasus sprang from the blood of her decapitated body.

In art, Chrysaor&#x27;s earliest appearance seems to be on the great pediment of the Temple of Artemis, Corfu dated to the early 6th century BCE, where he is shown beside his mother, Medusa.
==Offspring==

Chrysaor and Callirrhoe may have also been the parents of Echidna.

In an alternate genealogy from Stephanus of Byzantium&#x27;s &quot;Ethnica&quot;, Chrysaor is a son of Glaucus and grandson of Sisyphus, and his son Mylasus goes on to found Mylasa. This ancestry would make Chrysaor a double of Bellerophon.

<text>In Greek mythology, Asia (Ancient Greek: Ἀσία) was one of the 3,000 Oceanids, daughters of the Titans Oceanus and his sister-spouse Tethys. In some accounts, her mother was called Pompholyge and sister of Libye.

== Family ==
According to Apollodorus, Asia was the wife of the Titan Iapetus, and mother of Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius although Hesiod gave the name of another Oceanid, Clymene, as their mother.

It is possible that the name &quot;Asia&quot; became preferred over Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Clymene&quot; to avoid confusion with the Clymene who was mother of Phaethon by Helios in some accounts and must have been perceived as a distinct figure. Herodotus recorded the tradition that the continent &quot;Asia&quot; was named after Asia whom he called &quot;wife&quot; of Prometheus rather than &quot;mother&quot; of Prometheus, perhaps here a simple error rather than genuine variant tradition. Both Acusilaus and Aeschylus in his &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; called Prometheus&#x27; wife Hesione.

Herodotus also related a Lydian tradition &quot;that Asia was not named after Prometheus&#x27; wife Asia, but after Asies, the son of Cotys, who was the son of Manes, and that from him the Asiad clan at Sardis also takes its name&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Asteria (; Ancient Greek: Ἀστερία, &quot;of the stars, starry one&quot;) was a name attributed to several distinct individuals.

== Individuals ==
* Asteria, a minor goddess who became the island Ortygia or Delos, daughter of Phoebe and Coeus and sister to Leto.
* Asteria or Astris, daughter of Helios and Clymene or Ceto, one of the Heliades. She married the river god Hydaspes (the modern Jhelum River) and became mother of Deriades, king in India.
* Asteria, one of the Danaïdes, daughters of Danaus who, with one exception, murdered their husbands on their wedding nights. She was, briefly, the bride of Chaetus.
* Asteria, one of the Alcyonides, daughters of the giant Alcyoneus. She was the sister of Alkippe, Anthe, Drimo, Pallene, Methone and Phthonia (Phosthonia or Chthonia). When their father Alcyoneus was slain by Heracles, these girls threw themselves into the sea from Kanastraion, which is the peak of Pellene. They were then transformed into halcyons (kingfishers) by the goddess Amphitrite.
* Asteria, daughter of Hydeus, was the mother of Hydissos by Bellerophon. Her son is known for having founded a city in Caria which was named after him.
* Asteria, daughter of Coronus, and Apollo were possible parents of the seer Idmon.
* Asteria or Asterodia, mother of Crisus and Panopeus by Phocus.
* Asteria, daughter of Teucer and Eune of Cyprus.
* Asteria, the ninth Amazon killed by Heracles when he came for Hippolyte&#x27;s girdle.
* Asteria, an Athenian maiden among the would-be sacrificial victims of Minotaur, portrayed in a vase painting.

==In popular culture==
* Christoph Willibald Gluck gave the name Asteria to a character in his 1765 opera &quot;Telemaco&quot;; however, the name did not appear in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, on which the opera is based.
* Multiple characters named Asteria appear in the DC Universe and the DC Extended Universe:
** Asteria first appeared in the 1998 one-shot issue &quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl&quot;; &quot;her origin or background isn&#x27;t touched upon, but she does seem to be Amazon stock&quot;.
** Another version of Asteria appeared in the 2018 issues &quot;Justice League/Aquaman: Drowned Earth Special&quot; #1 and &quot;Justice League&quot; #11. In the first issue, Asteria is a two-headed metallic bird. In the second issue, Wonder Woman informs Aquaman that &quot;the name &#x27;Asteria&#x27; belonged to an ancient Amazonian who fought against the gods. Her name means, of the sky&quot;.
** In the 2020 film &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot;, Asteria is portrayed by Lynda Carter. The character is depicted as the greatest Amazon warrior. When mankind enslaved the Amazonian women, Asteria fought for their freedom, allowing Queen Hippolyta to free them and their race to escape to the island known as Themyscira. The island created by Zeus allowed the Amazons to remain hidden from mankind, while Asteria was venerated by the Amazons as a fallen hero. During the post-credits sequence, she is seen walking amongst a crowded street and saves a pedestrian from being hit by a falling object.
* Asteria is the codename of the Chapter 4 map in &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot;. This continues the trend of each map being named after a Greek deity whose name starts with the letter &quot;A&quot; (Athena for Chapter 1, Apollo for Chapter 2, and Artemis for Chapter 3).

<text>In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Astraea (; ), also spelled Astrea or Astria, is a daughter of Astraeus and Eos. She is the virgin goddess of justice, innocence, purity, and precision. She is closely associated with the Greek goddess of justice, Dike, the daughter of Zeus and Themis. Astraea is not to be confused with Asteria, the goddess of the stars and the daughter of Coeus and Phoebe.

In Greek myth, Astraea lived together with humans on earth during the idealistic Golden Age, when people were virtuous and no evil existed in the world. But as the human race became progressively crueler and more corrupt, Astraea decided to abandon humanity forever and live among the stars as the constellation Virgo.

The main belt asteroid 5 Astraea is named after her, and her name was also suggested for the planet Uranus.

== Etymology ==
The goddess&#x27;s name &quot;Astraea&quot; (spelled in Ancient Greek &#x27;) is derived from the Greek word (&quot;astḗr&quot;) meaning &quot;star&quot;. The word in turn is inherited from the Proto-Indo-European root &#x27; (“star”), from &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to burn&quot;. Astraea&#x27;s name thus shares an etymology with the name of Astraeus, who is her father in some versions, and cousin Asteria.

== Family and attributes ==
When identified with the justice goddess Dike, Astraea is made the daughter of Zeus and Themis, or otherwise she is the daughter of Astraeus and Eos-Aurora, goddess of the dawn. Juvenal calls Astraea the sister of Pudicitia (the Roman goddess of chastity and equivalent to Greek Aidos), and that the two sisters withdrew from the mortal world together. When relating this tale, ancient authors tend to alternate between referring to her as &quot;Dike&quot; or &quot;Astraea&quot;. As Dike, she is also called Iustitia, the name of the Roman goddess of justice and counterpart to Dike. Astraea was represented holding a pair of scales, symbol of justice and impartiality.

== Mythology ==
=== The Golden Age ===
Astraea, the celestial virgin who presided over justice, modesty and good faith, was traditionally said to be the last of the immortals to live together with humans during the Golden Age, the first of the old Greek religion&#x27;s five Ages of Man until the coming of the harsh Iron Age, when the world fell into disarray and people only coveted gold, while family and friends would no longer trust each other.

The myth of Astraea has been variously attributed to eighth-century BC Greek poet Hesiod, who in his surviving works prophesied that since mankind had deteriorated so much in morality and virtue during his era (that is the Fifth Age, or Iron Age) the goddesses Nemesis and Aidos, who embodied divine retribution and humility respectively, would finally abandon the earth once and for all and return to Mount Olympus by the end of it, forsaking men and leaving them to deal with the hardships and evils on their own.

Later authors, starting first with Aratus writing over four hundred years after Hesiod, expanded on the tale. According to the later myths, at the beginning of time Justice (Dike) or Astraea the daughter of Astraeus used to live and mingle with men and women on earth, an immortal among mortals. During this Golden Age there was no strife, war and battle or detestation between people as Justice urged them all to be kind to each other and spread feelings of virtue and honour among them. In this pre-seafaring era, humans only ploughed their rich fields while Justice supplied them with all they could ever want or need.

As the Golden Age ended and the Silver one arrived, the goddess found herself dissatisfied as people were less virtuous than before and started yearning for the older times. She no longed spoke with gentle words to them and took to the hills and then the mountains. She used threats and shame on them, but failed to motivate them to become better people. Then the Bronze and Iron Ages rolled in which introduced war and hatred, corruption, people consuming the oxen they previously only used to plough the fields and the vanishment of honour and love. They began to sail the seas after cutting down trees to build ships, divided the free land between them and dug up the earth in search for wealth such as iron and gold. Finally the disillusioned Dike-Astraea decided to abandon humanity for good and take her place among the stars as the constellation Virgo, also known as the Maiden, with the star Spica as the ear of corn she holds.

To a smaller extend, Astraea was also envisioned as the goddess who watched over mortals and then reported their wrongdoings back to Zeus. Valerius Flaccus wrote that the harsh weather and storms of November were associated with Zeus&#x27; vengeance against mankind on behalf of Astraea. According to Nonnus, Astraea as the starry nurse of the universe once took under her care and nurished Beroe, the daughter of Aphrodite. She nursed the infant on her breast and fashioned a necklace out of Spica for her.

=== Virgil ===
The first-century BC Roman poet Virgil wrote that Astraea was destined one day to come back to Earth, bringing with her the return of the utopian Golden Age of which she was the ambassador, and the reign of Saturnus, a Roman fertility god associated with the Greek Cronus, but who nevertheless had an independent origin and worship in the Italic peninsula, lauded as the fallen god-king who introduced agriculture and helped humans develop civilization. The prophecy of Astraea&#x27;s hoped-for return is found in the fourth book of his &quot;Eclogues&quot;: 

Virgil used the pre-existing myth of Astraea within a political frame in order to hail the dawning Augustan rule, signaling the return of harmony and lack of war, conflict and suffering; he adds that Astraea&#x27;s return will be accompanied by the arrival of a child who will also kick off Augustus&#x27; new golden age. What is the identity of the child that would escort Astraea is the subject of much debate; it has been speculated that Virgil meant the son of Gaius Asinius Pollio, the consul to whom the poem was dedicated; or the marriage of Mark Antony and Octavia the Younger, Augustus&#x27; sister; or even Alexander Helios, the son of Cleopatra and Mark Antony.

== Conflation with Dike ==
Astraea was conflated and often treated as interchangable with Dike, one of the Horae (daughters of Zeus and Themis) and goddess of justice, who was also given the same story of living with mortals during the early years of humanity before abandoning them to become the Virgo after their wickedness and lawlessness became too unbearable for her. Dike&#x27;s fiercer form was Nemesis, the goddess who is set to depart from the earth in Hesiod&#x27;s prophecy.

Judging from the preserved Greek and Roman corpus and art, there is no indication that this goddess was ever properly called &quot;Astraea&quot; before Ovid in the early first century AD, with writers preceding him preferring &quot;Dike&quot; (&quot;justice&quot;) or simply &quot;the Maiden&quot; to refer to her. It seems that the notion of using Astraea as her name proper was prompted from Aratus writing that Astraeus was the star-maiden&#x27;s father.

== Legacy of Astraea ==
During the European Renaissance, Astraea became associated with the general spirit of renewal of culture occurring at that time, particularly in England, where she became poetically identified in literature with the figure of Queen Elizabeth I as the virgin Queen reigning over a new Golden Age. In Spain, she was often identified with the rule of Philip IV. The French author Honoré d&#x27;Urfé wrote a very popular serial novel called &quot;L&#x27;Astrée&quot;, whose titular heroine is named after Astraea, which was published serially between 1607 and 1627 with each installment very much anticipated by the aristocratic public at the time; Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his &quot;Confessions&quot; (p. 160 Penguin Classics) notes it as one of the novels read with his father and says it &quot;was the one that recurred most frequently to my mind&quot;. A spectacle play by the Count of Villamediana and thirteen dramas by Pedro Calderón de la Barca introduce a character named Astraea to highlight the political and astrological concerns. In the Russian Empire, Astraea was identified first with Empress Elizabeth of Russia, then with Empress Catherine the Great of Russia.

The English epic poet Edmund Spenser further embellished this myth at the opening of Book V of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; (1596), where he claims that Astraea left behind &quot;&quot; called Talus. William Shakespeare refers to Astraea in &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;, and also in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;. In his most famous play, &quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;, Calderón has a character named Rosaura (an anagram for &quot;dawns&quot;) take on the name of Astraea at Court. This may be a laudatory political allusion to the dawn of a new Golden Age under Philip IV/Segismundo.

Astraea is also referenced in John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, in Book IV between lines 990 and 1000. When Satan is discovered in the Garden of Eden and brought before the Angel Gabriel, the two are on the verge of war.

The British writer Aphra Behn used &quot;Astrea&quot; as one of her code-names while working as a spy for King Charles II. She subsequently used the name &quot;Astrea&quot; to identify the speaker in many of her poems, and was herself referred to as &quot;The Incomparable Astrea&quot;.

Astraea was represented on a allegorical engraving by John Norman published in 1784, just a few years after the American declaration of independence, in which she appears to decide on where on earth she will make her residence while Nature is about to play the lyre, Fame blows her trumpet and Liberty presents a medal to George Washington.

&quot;&quot; is also the title of a poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

<text>In Greek mythology and religion, Themis (; ) is the goddess and personification of justice, divine order, law, and custom. She is one of the twelve Titan children of Gaia and Uranus, and the second wife of Zeus. She is associated with oracles and prophecies, including the Oracle of Delphi. Her symbol is the Scales of Justice.

==Name==
&quot;Themis&quot; means &quot;divine law&quot; rather than human ordinance, literally &quot;that which is put in place&quot;, from the Greek verb &quot;títhēmi&quot; (), meaning &quot;to put.&quot;

To the ancient Greeks she was originally the organizer of the &quot;communal affairs of humans, particularly assemblies.&quot; Moses Finley remarked of &quot;themis&quot;, as the word was used by Homer in the 8th century BCE, to evoke the social order of the 10th- and 9th-century Greek Dark Ages:

Finley adds, &quot;There was &quot;themis&quot;—custom, tradition, folk-ways, &quot;mores&quot;, whatever we may call it, the enormous power of &#x27;it is (or is not) done.&#x27;&quot;

In the &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot;, Themis is referred to as &quot;Ichnaea&quot;, meaning &quot;Tracker&quot;.

==Description==
Some classical descriptions of Themis describe a sober-looking woman holding scales. Themis is an earth goddess much like her mother, Gaia, and in some stories it is hard to tell the two apart. Some classical depictions of Themis show her holding a sword.

When Themis is disregarded, Nemesis brings just and wrathful retribution; thus Themis shared the small temple at Rhamnous with Nemesis. Themis is not wrathful; when a distraught Hera returned to Olympus after quarrelling with Zeus, Themis, &quot;of the lovely cheeks,&quot; was the first to offer her a cup.

Themis presided over the proper relation between man and woman, the basis of the rightly ordered family (the family was seen as the pillar of the deme). Judges were often referred to as &quot;themistopóloi&quot; (the servants of Themis). Such was also the basis for order upon Olympus. Even Hera addressed her as &quot;Lady Themis&quot;.

===Hesiod===
Themis occurred in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; as the first recorded appearance of &quot;Justice&quot; as a divine personage. Drawing not only on the socio-religious consciousness of his time but also on many of the earlier cult-religions, Hesiod described the forces of the universe as cosmic divinities. Hesiod portrayed temporal justice, Dike, as the daughter of Zeus and Themis. Dike executed the law of judgments and sentencing and, together with her mother Themis, she carried out the final decisions of Moirai.

===Aeschylus===
In the play &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, traditionally attributed to Aeschylus, it is said by Prometheus that Themis is called many names, including Gaia.

==Family==
In Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Themis is one of the twelve Titan children of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky). She is the second wife of her nephew Zeus, by whom she is the mother of the Horae (Seasons), listed as Eunomia (Law), Dike (Justice), Eirene (Peace), and the Moirai (Fates), listed as Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. Similarly to Hesiod&#x27;s account, the &quot;Orphic Hymn to Themis&quot; calls her the daughter of Gaia and Uranus, and the &quot;Orphic Hymn to the Seasons&quot; calls her the mother, by Zeus, of the Horae.

Hyginus, in his &quot;Fabulae&quot;, makes Themis the daughter of Aether and Terra (Earth), and by Zeus the mother of the Horae. In the play &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, traditionally attributed to Aeschylus, Themis is the mother of Prometheus, while according to a scholion on Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Hippolytus&quot;, Themis is mother of the Hesperides by Zeus.

== Mythology ==
Themis built the Oracle at Delphi and was herself oracular. According to another legend, Themis received the Oracle at Delphi from Gaia and later gave it to Phoebe, who gave it to her grandson Apollo as a birthday gift. According to Ephorus, Themis helped Apollo find the oracle, with the intent of helping mankind. Some examples of Themis&#x27; visions; In the story of Dryope in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Themis warns the gods of an oncoming civil war in Thebes. In another tale she warns Zeus and Poseidon to not marry Thetis because her son will be more powerful than his father. According to Ovid, it was Themis rather than Zeus who told Deucalion to throw the bones of &quot;his Mother&quot; over his shoulder to create a new race of humankind after the deluge. Also according to Ovid, Themis prophesied that a son of Zeus will steal golden apples from the orchard of Atlas.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; she is tasked with calling the gods to council on Olympus by Zeus.

Themis was present at Delos to witness the birth of Apollo, and nursed him with nectar and ambrosia. In his &quot;De astronomia&quot;, Hyginus lists Themis, in addition to the nymph Amalthea, as the foster-mother and nurse of the young Zeus. In a fragment of Pindar, Themis was brought from the springs of Oceanus by the Moirai (in this version not her daughters) to Olympus, where she became the first wife of Zeus (rather than the second), and by him the mother of the Horae.

According to the lost &quot;Cypria&quot; by Stasinus of Cyprus, Themis and Zeus together plotted the start of the Trojan War. According to Quintus Smyrnaeus, when the gods defied the orders of Zeus and started fighting each other after the creation of the Trojan Horse, Themis stopped them by warning them of Zeus&#x27;s wrath.

In the Orphic &quot;Rhapsodic Theogony&quot;, or Rhapsodies, (first century BC/AD) Nyx (Night) prophesied that Themis would remain a virgin until Rhea gave birth to a child of Cronus.

Themis also played a role in Eros, the young god of love, growing up; according to Porphyry, his mother Aphrodite was worried about her son, Eros, staying a child forever and brought him to Themis. Themis told her to give Eros a brother, as he wasn&#x27;t growing because of his solitude. Aphrodite then gave birth to another love god, Anteros (meaning &quot;counter-love&quot;), and Eros grew whenever he was near him. But every time Anteros was away, Eros shrank back to his previous, small form.

When four Cretan men (Aegolius, Celeus, Cerberus and Laius) broke into the sacred cavern in Crete where Rhea had given birth to Zeus in order to steal some of the honey produced there by the sacred bees, Themis and her daughters the Fates convinced Zeus against killing them inside the holy cave, as they considered it impious for anyone to die in the cave, so instead he turned all four into different birds.

==Cult==
Themis had several temples in Greece, though they are not described in any great detail by ancient authors. She had temples at the oracular shrine of Zeus at Dodona, at Tanagra, in Athens nearby to the Acropolis, a temple in Rhamnous beside one of Nemesis, and a Temple of Themis Ikhnaia in Phthiotis, Thessalia. Pausanias describes her sanctuary in Thebes in somewhat more detail than what was normally the case and it may therefore have been of more importance:

Along the road from the Neistan gate [at Thebes, Boiotia] are three sanctuaries. There is a sanctuary of Themis, with an image of white marble; adjoining it is a sanctuary of the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) [her daughters], while the third is of Zeus Agoraios (of the Market.)

Themis also had an altar in Olympia: &quot;On what is called the Stomion (Mouth) the altar to Themis has been built.&quot; Themis was sometimes depicted in the sanctuaries of other gods and may have shared temples with them occasionally, and she is mentioned to have shared a temple with Aphrodite in Epidauros: &quot;Within the grove [of the sanctuary of Asklepios (Asclepius) at Epidauros] are a temple of Artemis, an image of Epione, a sanctuary of Aphrodite and Themis, a race-course.&quot;

The temple of Themis in Athens is found west of the theater of Dionysus. Themis&#x27; temple in Dodona is tetrastyle pronaos in antis with a cella, an entrance on the northside and outside was a large altar. The temple columns in Dodona were Ionic made out of local sandstone.

== Modern depictions and dedications ==
Themis in modern-day depictions is often called &quot;Lady Justice&quot; and statues can be found outside many courthouses.

In 2022, the building hosting the main courtroom of the Court of Justice of the European Union&#x27;s General Court was renamed &quot;The Themis Building&quot;.

<text>The Glastonbury Festival (formally the Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts and known colloquially as Glasto) is a five-day festival of contemporary performing arts held near Pilton, Somerset, England, in most summers. In addition to contemporary music, the festival hosts dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret, and other arts. Leading pop and rock artists have headlined, alongside thousands of others appearing on smaller stages and performance areas. Films and albums have been recorded at the festival, and it receives extensive television and newspaper coverage.

Glastonbury takes place on 1500 acres of farmland and is attended by around 200,000 people, requiring extensive security, transport, water, and electricity-supply infrastructure. While the number of attendees is sometimes swollen by gatecrashers, a record of 300,000 people was set at the 1994 festival, headlined by the Levellers, who performed on the Pyramid Stage. Most festival staff are unpaid volunteers, helping the festival to raise millions of pounds for charity organisations.

Regarded as a major event in contemporary British culture, the festival is inspired by the ethos of the hippie, the counterculture of the 1960s, and the free festival movement. Vestiges of these traditions are retained in the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures, the Stone Circle and Healing Field. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called the Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert in 1970 at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.

The festival was held intermittently from 1970 until 1981 and has been held most years since, except for &quot;fallow years&quot; taken mostly at five-year intervals, intended to give the land, local population, and organisers a break. 2018 was a &quot;fallow year&quot;, and the 2019 festival took place from 26 to 30 June. There were then two consecutive &quot;fallow years&quot; due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival returned for 22–26 June 2022 with the headliners Billie Eilish, Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar. The next festival took place between 21 and 25 June 2023, headlined by Arctic Monkeys, Guns N&#x27; Roses and Elton John in his final UK performance.

== History ==
=== 1970 ===
The first festival at Worthy Farm was the Pop, Blues &amp; Folk Festival, hosted by Michael Eavis on Saturday 19 September 1970, and attended by 1,500 people. There had been a commercial UK festival tradition which included the National Jazz and Blues Festival and the Isle of Wight Festival. Eavis decided to host the first festival after seeing an open-air concert headlined by Led Zeppelin at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at the nearby Bath and West Showground in 1970.

The original headline acts were The Kinks and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders but these acts were replaced at short notice by Tyrannosaurus Rex, later known as T. Rex. Tickets were £1 (equivalent to £19.39 in 2024). Other billed acts of note were Steamhammer, Quintessence, Stackridge, Al Stewart, Pink Fairies and Keith Christmas.

=== 1971 ===
The &quot;Glastonbury Fair&quot; of 1971 was instigated by Andrew Kerr after being found and introduced to Michael Eavis by David Trippas and organised with help from Arabella Churchill, Jean Bradbery, Kikan Eriksdotter, John Massara, Jeff Dexter, Thomas Crimble, Bill Harkin, Gilberto Gil, Mark Irons, John Coleman, and Jytte Klamer. The 1971 festival featured the first incarnation of the &quot;Pyramid Stage&quot;. Conceived by Bill Harkin the stage was a one-tenth replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza built from scaffolding and metal sheeting and positioned over a &quot;blind spring&quot;, a term used to describe a hypothetical underground body of water in the pseudoscientific practice of dowsing.

Performers included Family, David Bowie, Mighty Baby, Traffic, Fairport Convention, Gong, Hawkwind, Pink Fairies, Skin Alley, The Worthy Farm Windfuckers and Melanie. It was paid for by its supporters and advocates of its ideal, and embraced a mediaeval tradition of music, dance, poetry, theatre, lights, and spontaneous entertainment. The 1971 festival was filmed by Nicolas Roeg and David Puttnam with Eavis and Kerr&#x27;s Glastonbury Fair changed to &quot;Glastonbury Fayre&quot;, and a triple album of the same name was released (no connection with the film).

=== 1979 ===
There was a small unplanned event in 1978, when the convoy of vehicles from the Stonehenge festival was directed by police to Worthy Farm; the festival was then revived the following year (1979) by Churchill, Crimble, Kerr and Eavis, in an event for the Year of the Child, which lost money.

=== 1980s ===

The 1980s saw the festival become an annual fixture, barring periodic fallow years. In 1981, Michael Eavis took back sole control of the festival, and it was organised in conjunction with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND). That year a new Pyramid Stage was constructed from telegraph poles and metal sheeting (repurposed from materials of the Ministry of Defence), a permanent structure which doubled as a hay barn and cowshed during the winter.

In the 1980s, the children&#x27;s area of the festival (which had been organised by Arabella Churchill and others) became the starting point for a new children&#x27;s charity called Children&#x27;s World. 1981 was the first year that the festival made profits, and Eavis donated £20,000 of them to CND (). In the following years, donations were made to a number of organisations, and since the end of the Cold War the main beneficiaries have been Oxfam, Greenpeace and WaterAid, who all contribute towards the festival by providing features and volunteers, who work at the festival in exchange for free entry.

It also saw the first TV coverage, with ITV broadcasting recorded highlights in the weeks after the festival.

Since 1983, large festivals have required licences from local authorities. This led to certain restrictions being placed on the festival, including a crowd limit and specified times during which the stages could operate. The crowd limit was initially set at 30,000 but has grown every year to over 100,000. 1984 saw the stage invaded by fans during The Smiths&#x27; set. Weather Report played the main stage, and Elvis Costello headlined the last night for almost three hours. In 1985, the festival grew too large for Worthy Farm, but neighbouring Cockmill Farm was purchased. That year saw a wet festival with considerable rain; Worthy Farm is a dairy farm and what washed down into the low areas was a mixture of mud and liquefied cow dung. This did not prevent festival goers from enjoying the knee-deep slurry in front of the Pyramid Stage.

1989 was the first year that impromptu, unofficial sound systems sprang up around the festival site – a portent of things to come. These sound systems would play loud, electronic acid house music around the clock, with the largest, the Hypnosis sound system, rivalling the volume of some of the official stages and running non-stop throughout the festival.

=== 1990s ===
Following the 1990 festival, violence flared between security guards and new age travellers in what became known as &quot;The Battle of Yeoman&#x27;s Bridge&quot;. Eavis was also facing increasing battles from locals over the festival, with no festival taking place in 1991. Both pressures are captured in the 1992 Channel 4 documentary &quot;Showdown at Glastonbury&quot;. 
An expanded festival returned in 1992, and this proved a great success. 1992 was the first year that the new age travellers were not initially allowed onto the site free, and a sturdier fence was designed. This success was carried through to 1993 which, like 1992, was hot and dry.

In 1994, the Pyramid Stage burned down just over a week before the festival; a temporary main stage was erected in time for the festival. The 1994 festival also introduced a 150 kW wind turbine which provided some of the festival power. Headliners Levellers set another record when they played to a crowd of as many as 300,000 people on their Friday performance, Glastonbury&#x27;s biggest ever crowd .

This was the year the festival was first televised live by Channel 4; the coverage concentrated on the main two music stages and providing a glimpse of the festival for those who knew little of it. Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;4 Goes to Glastonbury&quot; brought widely expanded televised coverage of the festival for the first time in 1994 and also the following year.

The TV broadcast in 1994 was a crucial factor in ensuring that Orbital&#x27;s performance at the festival achieved legendary status. As a result, living rooms across the country were able to experience what a rave might look like, and suddenly dance music, which had been ignored by the establishment and mainstream press for years, did not seem so dangerous and which would be a turning point for the music at Glastonbury. Speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2013 about the Orbital gig, Michael Eavis noted that it marked dance music&#x27;s appearance on the mainstream agenda. &quot;What was previously underground made it on to one of the big stages, and there was no going back from there. As the police and the council made me very well aware, the buzz had been around the raves and the market sound systems and in the travellers&#x27; fields for years. But it needed a showcase to make it legal.&quot; The gig opened the way for others such as the Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack and Underworld, who all played high-profile stages in the following years – developments that led to the launch of the festival&#x27;s Dance Village in 1997.

1995 saw the attendance rise drastically due to the security fence being breached on the Friday of the festival. Estimates suggest there may have been enough fence-jumpers to double the size of the festival. This aside, 1995 proved to be a highly successful year with memorable performances from Oasis, Elastica, Pulp, PJ Harvey, Jeff Buckley, Jamiroquai and The Cure. This was also the first year of the festival having a dance tent to cater for the rising popularity of dance music, following the success of Orbital&#x27;s headline appearance the previous year. The dance acts of 1995 were led by Massive Attack on the Friday and Carl Cox on the Saturday. The festival took a year off in 1996 to allow the land to recover and give the organisers a break. 1996 also saw the release of &quot;Glastonbury the Movie&quot; which was filmed at the 1993 and 1994 festivals.

The festival returned in 1997. This time there was major sponsorship from &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the BBC, who had taken over televising the event from Channel 4. This was also the year of the mud, with the site suffering severe rainfalls which turned the entire site into a muddy bog. However, those who stayed for the festival were treated to many memorable performances, including Radiohead&#x27;s headlining Pyramid Stage set on the Saturday which is said to be one of the greatest ever Glastonbury performances. The live recording of &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; from this performance, as well as others such as &quot;The Day Before Yesterday&#x27;s Man&quot; by The Supernaturals, were released on a BBC CD entitled &quot;Mud For It&quot;.

In 1998 the festival was once again struck with severe floods and storms, and again some festival goers departed early – but those who stayed were treated to performances from acts such as Pulp, Robbie Williams and Blur. Tony Bennett, however, overcame the messy environment in an immaculate white suit and tie. 1998 was also the first year that attendance officially broke the 100,000 mark.

Another hot dry year was recorded in 1999, much to the relief of organisers and festival goers. The festival was again overcrowded due to fence-jumpers, but this would not prove to be a major problem until the following year, when an additional 100,000 people gatecrashed the site, increasing the attendance to an estimated 250,000 people total. The 1999 festival is also remembered for the Manic Street Preachers requesting and being given their own backstage toilets; however, it was revealed by the band that this was a joke – the &quot;reserved&quot; sign on the toilet was not at the authorisation of the management.

Speaking to the BBC in 2024, Michael Eavis&#x27; daughter Emily explained that her parents always planned to close the festival when they reached retirement age, with many of the festivals in the 1990s being &quot;the last one&quot;. The death of Michael Eavis&#x27; wife Jean in 1999 persuaded him to continue organising the festival.

=== 2000s ===
2000 saw a new Pyramid Stage introduced as well as new features such as The Glade and The Left Field. The festival was headlined by Chemical Brothers, Travis and David Bowie, who played thirty years after his first appearance. The Pyramid Stage also hosted an unusual event on the Saturday morning, with the wedding of two festivalgoers, who had written to the organisers asking for permission to get married there, taking place and conducted by actor Keith Allen in front of a small group of friends and any other festivalgoers who still happened to be awake. This year also saw an estimated 250,000 people attend the festival (only 100,000 tickets were sold) due to gatecrashers. This led to public safety concerns and the local District Council refused any further licences until the problem was solved.

The organisers took 2001 off to devise anti-gatecrashing measures and secure the future of the festival, after the Roskilde Festival 2000 accident (though this was also a scheduled break, one which took place every five years from 1991, the year after the battle of Yeoman&#x27;s Bridge, until the 2012 Olympics extended the five-year sequence from the planned 2011 rest year). It was at this point that the Mean Fiddler Organisation was invited to help.

In 2002, the festival returned after its planned fallow year, with the controversial Mean Fiddler now handling the logistics and security – especially installing a substantial surrounding fence (dubbed the &quot;superfence&quot;) that reduced numbers to the levels of a decade earlier. 2002 also saw Coldplay headline the Pyramid Stage for the first time while the show was closed by a set from Rod Stewart on the Sunday night.

There were some criticisms of the 2002 festival that it lacked atmosphere, because of the reduced number of people, which reflected the smaller numbers jumping the fence. The number of tickets was increased to 150,000 for 2003 which sold out within one day of going on sale, in marked contrast to the two months it took to sell 140,000 in 2002. It was also the first year that tickets sold out before the full line-up was announced. This was also the year Radiohead returned to headline the Pyramid Stage. Revenue raised for good causes from ticket and commercial licence sales topped £1 million, half of which went to Oxfam, Greenpeace and Water Aid.

In 2004, tickets sold out within 24 hours amid much controversy over the ticket ordering process, which left potential festival goers trying for hours to connect to the overloaded telephone and internet sites. The website got two million attempted connections within the first five minutes of the tickets going on sale and an average of 2,500 people on the phone lines every minute. The festival was not hit by extreme weather, but high winds on the Wednesday delayed entry, and steady rain throughout Saturday turned some areas of the site to mud. The festival ended with Muse headlining the Pyramid Stage on Sunday, after Oasis had headlined on Friday. Franz Ferdinand and Sir Paul McCartney also performed. In the British press publications appeared about the use of psychedelic drugs by festival visitors. The magazine &quot;NME&quot; pronounced that 2004 would be &quot;the third summer of love&quot; due to the resurgence of the &quot;shroom&quot; that was praised as a natural alternative to ecstasy, which was said to be declining in popularity (LSD fuelled the first summer of love in 1967; ecstasy and LSD the second in 1988).

After the 2004 festival, Michael Eavis commented that 2006 would be a year off – in keeping with the previous history of taking one &quot;fallow year&quot; in every five to give the villagers and surrounding areas a rest from the yearly disruption. This was confirmed after the licence for 2005 was granted.

In 2005 the 112,500 ticket quota sold out rapidly – in this case in 3 hours 20 minutes. For 2005, the enclosed area of the festival was over , had over 385 live performances, and was attended by around 150,000 people. The Sunday headliner was originally scheduled to be Kylie Minogue, but she had to pull out in May after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Basement Jaxx were announced as a replacement on 6 June. Both Coldplay and Basement Jaxx performed a cover of Kylie&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out Of My Head&quot; during their concert. 2005 saw a big increase in the number of dance music attractions, with the multiple tents of the Dance Village replacing the solitary dance tent of previous years. This new area contained the East and West dance tents, the Dance Lounge, Roots Stage, and Pussy Parlour, as well as a relocated G Stage, formerly situated in the Glade. The introduction of the silent disco by festival organiser Emily Eavis allowed revellers to party into the early hours without disturbing the locals – a requirement of the festival&#x27;s licensing. Following the death of DJ John Peel in the autumn of 2004, the New Tent was renamed the John Peel Tent, in homage to his encouragement and love of new bands at Glastonbury. The opening day of the 2005 festival was delayed by heavy rain and thunderstorms: Several stages, including the Acoustic Tent (and one of the bars), were struck by lightning, and the valley was hit with flash floods that left some areas of the site under more than four feet of water. The severity of the weather flooded several campsites, the worst affected being the base of Pennard Hill, and seriously disrupted site services. However, Mendip District Council&#x27;s review of the festival called it one of the &quot;safest ever&quot; and gives the festival a glowing report in how it dealt with the floods.

There was no festival in 2006. Instead, a documentary film directed by Julien Temple was released to make up for the lack of a festival. The film consists of specially shot footage by Temple at the festival, as well as footage sent in by fans and archive footage. &quot;Glastonbury&quot; was released in the UK on 14 April 2006.

Glastonbury 2007 (20–24 June) was headlined by Arctic Monkeys, The Killers, and The Who on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Dame Shirley Bassey was also featured. In 2007, over 700 acts played on more than 80 stages and the capacity expanded by 20,000 to 177,000. This was the first year that &quot;The Park&quot; area opened. Designed by Emily Eavis, its main stage featured extra sets by several artists playing on the main stages including Spinal Tap, Pete Doherty and Gruff Rhys, whilst the BBC launched their new &quot;Introducing&quot; stage in the area. The festival had the largest attendance since the construction of the security fence, and the largest legitimate attendance to date: ticket allocation was raised by 27,500 to 137,500, which were charged at £145 and sold out in 1 hour 45 minutes. As an extra precaution against touts (scalpers), purchasers had to pre-register, including submission of a passport photo which was security printed into the ticket. Continued periods of rain throughout much of the festival caused muddy conditions, though without the flooding of 2005, in part due to the new £750,000 flood defences. However, this constant rain made the general conditions within the site worse than 2 years before and more like the mud plains of 1998. It was difficult to find anywhere to sit down that had not turned to mud and key choke points, such as the thoroughfare at the front right of the Pyramid Stage, turned into a quagmire. Muddy conditions on the temporary roads on the periphery of the site led to delays for people leaving the site.

On 25 June, when the vast majority of festival goers were attempting to leave the festival, cars in the western car parks took more than nine hours to exit the site. There was no stewarding provision in these areas, no information was disseminated regarding the delays, no organised marshalling of traffic was undertaken by the festival organisers, and no provision of drinking water was made to people stranded in their vehicles. Verbal and physical violence was witnessed between festival goers. When cars were finally allowed to leave the site the surrounding roads were found to be clear. Reported crime was down from 2005 but the number of arrests were &quot;well up&quot;, after a proactive operation of the police and security on site. There were 236 reported crimes, down from 267 in 2005; of these, 158 were drug related (183 in 2005). 1,200 people required medical aid with 32 hospitalised, most of which were accidents caused by the mud. There was one fatality: a West Midlands man found unconscious early on the Saturday morning died in Yeovil District Hospital of a suspected drugs overdose.

On 20 December 2007, Arabella Churchill, an instrumental figure in the conception of the 1971 festival and since the 1980s area coordinator of the Theatre Field, died at St Edmund&#x27;s Cottages, Bove Town, Glastonbury at the age of 58. She had suffered a short illness due to pancreatic cancer, for which she had refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She was a convert to Buddhism, and arrangements following her death respected her belief. Michael Eavis, paying tribute to her after her death, said &quot;Her vitality and great sense of morality and social responsibility have given her a place in our festival history second to none&quot;.
The Glastonbury Festival 2008 was held on 27, 28 and 29 June, headlined by Kings of Leon, Jay-Z and The Verve on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively, with other notable acts including Neil Diamond, Shakin&#x27; Stevens, Levellers, and Stackridge, who opened the first festival in 1970. Continuing the procedure introduced in 2007, ticket buyers had to pre-register and submit a passport photo between 1 February and 14 March to buy tickets which went on sale at 9 am on Sunday 6 April. Following 40,000 tickets not being sold, the pre-registration process was reopened on 8 April. Several reasons have been cited for this, including the poor weather of the previous four years and the controversial choice of featuring the hip hop artist, Jay-Z, as a headlining act. A day before the festival began, Michael Eavis announced that there were still around 3,000 tickets remaining, making it possible that it would be the first festival in 15 years not to sell out in advance. It had also been announced that any remaining tickets would be sold from major branches of HMV.

2008 saw the introduction of a new field adjacent to the Sacred space and Park Stage. Not named by the organisers, the festival goers themselves called it &quot;Flagtopia&quot; in reference to the flags located there. After the huge number of tents left behind in 2007 and when one of Michael Eavis&#x27;s cows died after ingesting a metal tent-peg left in the soil, the Festival devised its Love the Farm, Leave No Trace campaign which gently pushed revellers to respect the environment and clear up after themselves. The Festival had always pushed a green agenda and new initiatives in 2008 included biodegradable tent pegs handed out free to all campers and biotractors running on waste vegetable oil. These new efforts were rewarded with The Greener Festival Award for 2008 alongside a number of other festivals also committed to environmentally friendly music festivals. The 2008 festival was reported to have cost £22 million to produce.

The Glastonbury Festival 2009 took place between 24 and 28 June 2009. In marked contrast with previous years, the 137,500 tickets went on sale on 5 October 2008, earlier than ever before, with pre-registered customers able either to pay in full, or place a £50 reserve deposit to be paid by 1 February. Tickets for the festival sold out. The full line up was released on 25 May 2009 and included headliners Blur, Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young on the Pyramid Stage. The Other stage was headlined by The Prodigy, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand. Other notable performers included Jarvis Cocker, Fairport Convention (who played at the first Glastonbury Festival), Tom Jones, Steel Pulse, Doves, Lady Gaga, Jason Mraz, Nick Cave, Pete Doherty, Hugh Cornwell, Status Quo, The Gaslight Anthem (in which Springsteen appeared on stage during their song &quot;The &#x27;59 Sound&quot;), Madness, Dizzee Rascal, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Lily Allen, Kasabian and Florence and the Machine.

=== 2010s ===
The Glastonbury Festival 2010 took place between 23 and 28 June. On the last night, Michael Eavis appeared on the main stage with headline artist Stevie Wonder to sing the chorus of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;, marking the festival&#x27;s 40th year. Tickets went on sale on 4 October 2009, using the same £50 deposit scheme introduced the previous year; unlike the previous two years, and more in common with earlier festivals, the tickets for the 2010 edition sold out in less than 24 hours. U2 were due to headline the Pyramid Stage on Friday night at Glastonbury 2010, but due to frontman Bono sustaining a back injury they were forced to pull out. According to the media, Bono was &quot;gutted&quot;, even having written a song especially for the festival. Damon Albarn&#x27;s Gorillaz replaced U2, and joined Muse and Stevie Wonder for the Saturday and Sunday headline slots respectively. It was Albarn&#x27;s second headlining act in two years. Pet Shop Boys returned after 10 years to headline the Other Stage on the Saturday Night. The entire stage set from their Pandemonium Tour was brought in for the performance which was extremely well received. Radiohead&#x27;s Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood made a surprise appearance with a nine-song set. The weather at the festival was among some of the best ever, the festival-goers enjoying 3 days of abundant sunshine and very warm to hot temperatures, which reached close to 30 degrees on the Sunday; it was the first rain-free festival since 2002 and the hottest since the festival began.

During 2010 Michael Eavis received a donation from British Waterways of timber from the old gates at Caen Hill Locks in Wiltshire. This was used to construct a new bridge which was dedicated to the memory of Arabella Churchill. The following year more of the redundant lock gates were used to build the Campo Pequeno amphitheatre.

The Glastonbury Festival 2011 took place from Wednesday 22 until Sunday 26 June 2011. The tickets were sold out within 4 hours of going on sale on Sunday 3 October 2010. Headline acts for 2011 were U2 on the Friday night, Coldplay on the Saturday and Beyoncé on Sunday. This made Beyoncé the first woman to headline at the festival since 1999.

The festival was not held in 2012, giving the site and organisers a &quot;fallow year&quot; which originally would have been in 2011, in keeping with the tradition of taking a break every fifth year. Michael Eavis cited the shortage and likely cost of portable toilets and policing, due to the needs of the 2012 Summer Olympics, as being amongst the reasons. The decision to move the fallow year to 2012 also proved to be a fortunate one, as Somerset experienced spells of persistent heavy rain in the period up to and including the week that the festival would normally have been held. Indeed, Emily Eavis suggested that the festival itself might have been called off, such was the severity of the weather. Registration for tickets to the 2013 festival began in June 2011 and ticket booking opened at 9am on Sunday 7 October 2012, with 135,000 selling out in a record time of one hour and forty minutes. To mark the 2012 Glastonbury weekend, Eavis was invited to guest edit the local paper, the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot;, on Saturday 23 June.
During the 2014 festival, a 26-year-old Berkshire man suffered from a suspected reaction to Ketamine and later died in Bristol Royal Infirmary. Despite this, police reported that crime was down 30% from last year but reminded festival goers to look after their possessions. In 2014 Mendip District Council issued a licence for 10 years up until 2024.

A few weeks before the 2015 festival Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl fell off a stage during a show in Gothenburg and broke his leg, forcing their late withdrawal from the line-up. Florence and the Machine were moved from second-top on the bill to Friday&#x27;s headliner, while Florence&#x27;s vacant gap was filled by Reading &amp; Leeds headliners The Libertines, and their performance was well received. Kanye West and The Who were the headliners for the Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Other notable acts who performed included Motörhead (their final festival appearance in the UK before Lemmy&#x27;s death), the Moody Blues, Pharrell Williams, Deadmau5, Patti Smith, the Strypes, Lionel Richie, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Enter Shikari, the Chemical Brothers, Thee Faction, Alt-J, Paloma Faith, Mary J. Blige and Paul Weller, as well as an appearance by the 14th Dalai Lama. On 28 August 2015 it was announced that hundreds of pairs of discarded wellington boots from the 2015 festival were donated to the migrant camp at Calais.
On 3 April 2017, it was announced the BBC had renewed its exclusive national rights to broadcast the event until 2022. On 24 June 2017 reggae group Toots and the Maytals were slotted for 17:30, with BBC Four scheduled to show highlights from their set. When they did not show it was suspected they missed their time slot, and BBC broadcaster Mark Radcliffe apologised on their behalf stating, &quot;If you were expecting Toots and the Maytals – and, frankly, we all were – it seems like they were on Jamaican time or something because they didn&#x27;t make it to the site on time.&quot; The group credited with coining the term &quot;reggae&quot; in song was subsequently rescheduled by the Glastonbury Festival organisers giving Toots and the Maytals the midnight slot, with all other acts being shifted by one hour.
Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was invited to speak on the Pyramid Stage at the 2017 festival.

In February 2018, festival organiser Emily Eavis confirmed in a BBC interview that a plastic bottle ban could be enforced at the 2019 event for environmental reasons. Water kiosks, where festival-goers could get any type of bottle refilled, had been introduced in 2014. In February 2019, organisers confirmed the bottle ban would begin at that year&#x27;s festival, encompassing all bars, traders and backstage areas.

The festival had a &quot;fallow year&quot; in 2018 to allow the ground to recover. It returned in 2019. Glastonbury 2019 featured new stages, art installations and areas, including a giant crane purchased from Avonmouth Docks. The Pyramid Stage was headlined by Stormzy, The Killers and The Cure, with Miley Cyrus, Janet Jackson, Kylie Minogue, Wu-Tang Clan, The Chemical Brothers, The Bar-Steward Sons of Val Doonican and Fatboy Slim also performing.

=== 2020s ===
The 2020 and 2021 festivals were cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, for what would have been the festival&#x27;s 50th anniversary, the BBC broadcast a variety of acclaimed sets during the weekend of the cancelled festival, with performances by acts including Taylor Swift, Florence and the Machine, Adele, R.E.M., Beyoncé, the Rolling Stones, Jay-Z and Billie Eilish.

In 2021, Glastonbury produced a film recorded on the Glastonbury site, &quot;Live at Worthy Farm,&quot; with performances by acts including Coldplay, Haim, and Damon Albarn. &quot;Live at Worthy Farm&quot; also saw the debut of The Smile, a new band featuring Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead with Sons of Kemet drummer Tom Skinner. The film was streamed on the Glastonbury website on 22 May and broadcast on BBC Two on 27 June 2021.

The event returned in June 2022. Billie Eilish headlined the Friday night, making her the youngest Glastonbury headline act to date. Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar were headline acts for Saturday night (with Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds) and Sunday night respectively. Other acts included Diana Ross, Charli XCX, Foals, HAIM, Idles, Little Simz, Lorde, Olivia Rodrigo, Megan Thee Stallion, Pet Shop Boys, Phoebe Bridgers, Sam Fender, Sugababes, Wolf Alice and Years &amp; Years.
Tickets for Glastonbury 2023 sold out in one hour. Elton John, Guns N&#x27; Roses and Arctic Monkeys were announced as the headliners at the Pyramid Stage for Glastonbury 2023, amongst criticism of the &quot;all-male headliners&quot; at the festival.

It was announced in March 2023 that the John Peel stage would be renamed to Woodsies.

Arctic Monkeys returned to headline Glastonbury (Friday night) for the third time, having previously done so in 2007 and 2013. Other notable artists playing the Friday included Royal Blood, Fred Again, Young Fathers, Fever Ray, Carl Cox and Faithless. The mystery band listed as &#x27;The Churn Ups&#x27; was revealed to be surprise guests the Foo Fighters. Guns N&#x27; Roses headlined the Saturday. Other artists playing Saturday included Lana Del Ray, Loyle Carner, Fatboy Slim and Christine and the Queens. The afternoon &#x27;TBA&#x27; slot at the Woodsies was revealed as Rick Astley and Blossoms, playing The Smiths. The Sunday &#x27;legends&#x27; spot was filled by Yusuf/Cat Stevens. Elton John headlined the Pyramid Stage on Sunday, a show which he billed as his last ever UK performance.
The 2024 festival saw artists Dua Lipa and SZA headline the festival, as well Coldplay, who topped the bill for the fifth time. In doing so, Coldplay broke the record for most headline appearances, overtaking The Cure who have headlined four times.

On 17 November 2024, tickets for the 2025 Festival sold out in 35 minutes. Tickets cost £373.50, plus a £5 booking fee, an increase of £18.50 on 2024. In January 2025 it was reported that the festival had doubled its profit to the year March 2024, bringing in £5.9million pre-tax, donating £5.2 million to charitable organisations in the same period. On 3 January 2025, Neil Young was confirmed as the first headliner for Glastonbury 2025.

== Organisation ==

Since 1981, the festival has been organised by local farmer and site owner Michael Eavis (through his company Glastonbury Festivals Ltd). Eavis ran the festival with his wife Jean until her death in 1999, before co-organising the event with his daughter Emily Eavis. , Michael is still involved in the running of the festival; however, the majority of the organisation is run by Emily Eavis and her husband. In 2002, Festival Republic (a company consisting of both Live Nation and MCD) took on the job of managing the logistics and security of the festival through a 40% stake in the festival management company. This relationship ended in 2012 and Glastonbury festival is now independent. Glastonbury Festivals Ltd donates most of its profits to charities, including donations to local charity and community groups and paying for the purchase and restoration of the Tithe Barn in Pilton.

Several stages and areas are managed independently, such as The Left Field which is managed by a cooperative owned by Battersea and Wandsworth TUC, Worthy FM and a field run by Greenpeace.

With the exception of technical and security staff, the festival is mainly run by volunteers. Some 2,000 stewards are organised by the aid charity Oxfam. In return for their work at the festival, Oxfam receive a donation, which in 2005 was £200,000. Medical facilities are provided by Festival Medical Services who have done so since 1979. The bars are organised by the Workers Beer Company, sponsored by Carlsberg (previously Budweiser), who recruit teams of volunteer staff from small charities and campaign groups. In return for their help, typically around 18 hours over the festival, volunteers are paid in free entry, transport and food, while their charities receive the wages the volunteers earn over the event.

Catering, and some retail services, are provided by various small companies, typically mobile catering vans, with over 400 food stalls on site in 2010. The camping retail chain Millets, and independent shops, set up makeshift outlets at the festival. Additionally charities and organisations run promotional or educational stalls, such as the Hare Krishna tent which provide free vegetarian food. Network Recycling manage refuse on the site, and in 2004 recycled 300 tonnes and composted 110 tonnes of waste from the site.

The Pyramid Stage is 25 metres tall. The stage has 292 audio speakers. There are 8.5 km of cables for video and audio. On stage there are 354 microphones and 3743 light bulbs. The sound systems on site have a total power of 650,000 watts, with the main stage having 250 speakers. Aggreko provide over 27 megawatts of electricity to the site with bio-diesel generators. There are over 4,000 toilets, 2,000 long-drop and 1,300 compost, with water supplies including two reservoirs holding of water.

==Transport==

Significant logistical operations take place to bring people into the festival by public transport each year. Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station, mostly from London Paddington. The station operates as a mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required. This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days. Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.

== Location ==

The festival takes place in South West England at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle in Somerset, six miles east of Glastonbury, overlooked by the Glastonbury Tor in the &quot;Vale of Avalon&quot;. The area has a number of legends and spiritual traditions, and is a &quot;New Age&quot; site of interest: ley lines are considered to converge on the Tor. The nearest town to the festival site is Shepton Mallet, three miles (5 km) north east, but there continues to be interaction between the people espousing alternative lifestyles living in Glastonbury and the festival. The farm is situated between the A361 and A37 roads.

Worthy Farm is situated at in a valley at the head of the Whitelake River, between two low limestone ridges, part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. On the site is a confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River. In the past the site has experienced problems with flooding, though after the floods that occurred during the 1997 and 1998 festival, drainage was improved. This did not prevent flooding during the 2005 festival, but allowed the flood water to dissipate within hours. The Highbridge branch of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway ran through the farm on an embankment, but was dismantled in 1966 and now forms a main thoroughfare across the site. Another prominent feature is the high-voltage electricity line which crosses the site east–west. There are several public rights of way bordering the festival site.

In recent years the site has been organised around a restricted backstage compound, with the Pyramid Stage on the north, and Other stage on the south of the compound. Attractions on the east of the site include the acoustic tent, comedy tent and circus. To the south are the green fields, which include displays of traditional and environmentally friendly crafts. In King&#x27;s Meadow, the hill at the far south of the site, is a modern small megalith circle which, like Stonehenge, is coordinated with the summer solstice, and since 1990 represents a stone circle.

;Notes
== Accommodation ==
Most people who stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are different camping areas, each with its own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. An accessible campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna.

Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are not allowed into the main festival site. However, the purchase of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as &quot;campervans&quot;, all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.

Festival-goers can stay at local B&amp;B accommodation. There are several independent Glastonbury accommodation providers close to the main site, which include smaller campsites for tents, gypsy caravans, geo-domes, private cottages and more – some festival goers choose to be ferried between the festival and their accommodation by quad-bike or even private helicopter.

== Cultural references ==
It has been noted that Saint Dunstan, the Patron Saint of Music, was the Abbot of Glastonbury in 943. Various artists have written songs entitled Glastonbury or about the festival including Nizlopi, The Waterboys and Scouting for Girls. Cosmic Rough Riders included &quot;Glastonbury Revisited&quot; on their album &quot;Enjoy The Melodic Sunshine&quot; (Poptones) in 2000. Amy Macdonald, in her song &quot;Let&#x27;s Start a Band&quot; referenced Glastonbury: &quot;Give me a festival and I&#x27;ll be your Glastonbury star.&quot; Robbie Williams, in his song &quot;The 90s&quot;, refers to his surprise appearance on stage with Oasis in 1995, which ultimately led to him leaving Take That. Joe Strummer wrote the song &quot;Coma Girl&quot; about his experiences at Glastonbury, – in a BBC interview Bruce Springsteen cited the song as inspiring him to play the 2009 festival.

U2 wrote a song titled &quot;Glastonbury&quot; that was supposed to premier with their appearance at the festival, but an injury to Bono forced them to cancel. They instead premiered it in a concert in Turin on their 360° Tour. Marcus Brigstocke&#x27;s comic creation Giles Wemmbley Hogg had a special mock-documentary made about him going to Glastonbury as part of the &quot;Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off&quot; radio series. Deborah Crombie&#x27;s novel &quot;A Finer End&quot; takes place in Glastonbury with references to a fictional account of an original 1914 Glastonbury Fayre as well as the contemporary festival. Glastonbury is also a setting in John Osborne&#x27;s 2014 Radio 4 show &quot;The New Blur Album&quot;. Roxy Music did a song and album called &quot;Avalon&quot;, which is the ancient name for Glastonbury (Isle of Avalon).

The 2013 advertisement of the Indonesian cigarette brand owned by the Wismilak Group, Diplomat Mild (see also Cigarette advertising in Indonesia), made reference to the festival: &quot;One day, I would perform at Glastonbury&quot;.

Not all references are positive. Punk rock pioneers The Damned refer to &quot;Glastonbury hippies&quot; as one of the things requiring smashing in their 1979 single &quot;Smash It Up&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Ate () is the personification of moral blindness and error. She could blind the mind of both gods and men leading them astray. Ate was banished from Olympus by Zeus for blinding him to Hera&#x27;s trickery denying Heracles his birthright. Homer calls Ate the daughter of Zeus, while Hesiod has Ate as the daughter of Eris (Strife).

==Personification==
Like all the children of Eris (Strife), Ate is a personified abstraction, allegorizing the meaning of her name, and represents one of the many harms which might be thought to result from discord and strife. The meaning of her name, the Greek word &quot;atē&quot; (&quot;ἄτη&quot;), is difficult to define. &quot;Atē&quot; is a verbal noun of the verb &quot;aáō&quot; (&quot;ἀάω&quot;). According to &quot;The Cambridge Greek Lexicon&quot;, &quot;aáō &quot; means to &quot;lead astray&quot;, &quot;befuddle&quot;, &quot;blind&quot;, or &quot;delude&quot;, while &quot;ἄτη&quot; can mean: (1) the state of &quot;delusion, infatuation (inflicted on a person&#x27;s mind by a god, esp Zeus)&quot;, (2) &quot;reckless behavior ... recklessness, folly&quot;, and (3) &quot;ruin, calamity, harm&quot;. As informed by the meanings and usage of the unpersonified &quot;atē&quot;, personified Ate can apparently represent any part (or all?) of the causal sequence: (1) a blinding or clouding of the mind—causing (2) ill-considered and reckless actions—causing (3) the ruin such actions entail. She is thought of as being the instigator of delusion and its resulting destruction.

==Mythology==
Beyond being a mere personification, Ate has little actual identity. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Agamemnon, the leader of Greek expedition against Troy, tells the story of Ate&#x27;s deception of Zeus, and her subsequent banishment from Olympus, an etiological myth supposedly explaining how Ate entered the world of men. As told by Agamemnon, Hera tricked Zeus into swearing an oath that resulted in Zeus&#x27; son Heracles losing the birthright Zeus had intended for him. Zeus blamed Ate for clouding his mind causing him not to see Hera&#x27;s deception. In great anger Zeus grabbed Ate by the hair and flung her from Mount Olympus, and thereby Ate came to inhabit the &quot;fields of men&quot;. According to the mythographer Apollodorus, when Ate was thrown down by Zeus, Ate landed in Phrygia at a place called &quot;the hill of the Phrygian Ate&quot;, where the city of Troy was founded. The Hellenistic poet Lycophron, in his &quot;Alexandra&quot;, also mentions the place calling it &quot;the high Hill of Doom [Ate]&quot;.

==Family==
Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; calls Ate the eldest daughter of Zeus, with no mother mentioned. However, Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; has Ate as one of the several children of Eris (Strife), with no father mentioned. Her siblings include (among several others) her brothers Horkos (Oath), and the Machai (Wars), and sisters Limos (Famine), and Dysnomia (Lawlessness). Aeschylus, in his tragedy &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, has the Chorus call Peitho &quot;the unendurable child of scheming Ruin [Ate]&quot;.

==Zeus==
Ate is closely associated with Zeus. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Ate is called the &quot;eldest&quot; daughter of Zeus, an apparent indication of her power and her importance to Zeus. Ate (or the impersonal &quot;atē&quot;) is often referred to as the agent (or instrument) of Zeus&#x27; divine retribution. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Zeus is begged to send Ate so that the denier of &quot;Prayers ... may fall and pay full recompense.&quot; Although Agamemnon blames Ate for blinding him (which led to his dishonoring Achilles), he also says that it was Zeus (via Ate?) who robbed him of his senses. According to Hesiod, Zeus never sends war, nor famine, nor &quot;calamity [&quot;atē&quot;]&quot; to those who honor Justice, while Solon says that &quot;Zeus sends [&quot;atē&quot;] to punish&quot; men.

Ate also appears as an agent of Zeus&#x27; justice in Aeschylus&#x27;s tragic trilogy the &quot;Oresteia&quot;. In &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, the first play of the trilogy, Ate is linked with Helen of Troy, and Agamemnon&#x27;s wife Clytemnestra, both of whom act as agents of Zeus&#x27; retribution. Helen, who plays an instrumental role in Zeus&#x27; punishment of Troy, is likened to a &quot;priest&quot; of Ate, while Clytemnestra, who, by killing Agamemnon, is the direct instrument of Zeus&#x27; punishment, says that she did so with the aid of &quot;Ruin [Ate]&quot;. In the &quot;Libation Bearers&quot;, the second play of the &quot;Oresteia&quot;, Aeschylus describes Zeus as one who sends Ate to avenge &quot;reckless human violence!&quot;

==Ancient Greek sources==
Personified Ate occurs several times in Greek literature, from the Archaic through the Classical periods.

===Homer===
In Homer, &quot;atē&quot; is something inflicted by the gods; it causes delusion, then folly, then disaster. Ate, as the personification of atē, receives its fullest development in Homer&#x27;s&quot; Iliad&quot;, his epic poem about the Trojan War. However, to what extent Homer may have considered Ate to be an actual divinity as opposed to a mere allegory is unclear. The references to the goddess in the &quot;Iliad&quot; revolve around Agamemnon&#x27;s folly in having robbed Achilles, the Greeks greatest warrior, of his war prize, the slave Briseis, and Achilles&#x27; subsequent refusal to fight, which brought the Greeks to the brink of defeat. While the concept of &quot;atē&quot; is a central theme in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, occurring many times, Ate, as the personification of &quot;atē&quot;, is explicitly found in just two speeches, one in Book 9, and the other in Book 19.

====Allegory of the Prayers====
During the embassy to Achilles in Book 9, Achilles&#x27; old tutor Phoenix, trying to persuade Achilles to accept Agamemnon&#x27;s offer of reparations, and return to battle, tells the following parable in which the &quot;fleet of foot&quot; Ate (&quot;Blindness&quot;) outruns &quot;halting&quot; Prayers:

In this allegory, Ate appears twice. First Ate causes damage to human beings. Then Prayers follow after Ate to repair her damage. But if the repair offered by Prayers is rejected (in this case if Achilles rejects Agamemnon&#x27;s appeal) then Ate appears again as the punishment for such rejections. Ate both runs in front of Prayers, and when Prayers are refused, Ate also follows close behind. These two appearances can also be seen as examples of the Homeric Ate&#x27;s dual role, as both cause and effect. Here Ate is both the cause of the original offense (Agamemnon&#x27;s insult to Achilles), and the disastrous consequences which would (and will) follow from Achilles&#x27; refusal of Agamemnon&#x27;s attempt to make amends.

====Agamemnon&#x27;s apology====
In Book 19, Agamemnon attempts to excuse himself for having taken Briseis from Achilles, by blaming the &quot;accursed&quot; Ate (among others) for blinding his mind:

Phoenix&#x27;s speech in Book 9 and Agamemnon&#x27;s in Book 19 reveal different aspects of Ate&#x27;s nature. The first emphasizes Ate&#x27;s strength and speed, and her use by Zeus to punish (in this case, those who disregard Prayers). The second describes Ate&#x27;s soft feet, walking not on the ground, but above the &quot;heads of men&quot;, where, apparently unnoticed, she brings &quot;men to harm&quot;.

To further excuse his conduct, Agamemnon tells the story—as an illustration of Ate&#x27;s great power—of how:
According to Agamemnon, when Alcmene was about to give birth to Zeus&#x27;s son Heracles, Zeus, in his great pride, boasted that on that day would be born a man, of Zeus&#x27;s blood, who would be king of the Argives. But Hera tricked Zeus into swearing an unbreakable oath such that whatever man, of Zeus&#x27;s blood, born that day would be king. Then Hera delayed the birth of Heracles, and caused Eurystheus, the great-grandson of Zeus, to be born prematurely, and thus Heracles lost the birthright Zeus had intended for him. Zeus (like Agamemnon) blamed Ate for blinding him to Hera&#x27;s trickery. As punishment, an enraged Zeus:

===Hesiod===
Hesiod presented Ate as one of the several offspring of Eris, all of whom were personifications representing some of the many harms which can arise out of discord and strife. Hesiod particular associates Ate with her sister Dysnomia (Lawlessness). While listing the children of Eris, he lists both on the same line (230) of his &quot;Theogony&quot; and says they are &quot;much like one another&quot;.

In a passage in his &quot;Works and Days&quot; (213–285), Hesiod describes various relationships between several personifications, including Ate. The passage, which discusses the superiority of Dike (Justice) over Hybris, also mentions Eirene (Peace), who attends those who &quot;heed&quot; Dike (228), and Ate&#x27;s brother Horkos (Oath), who &quot;runs along side crooked judgements&quot; (219). In particular Hesiod associates Ate with &quot;war&quot;, which might refer to Ate&#x27;s brothers, the Machai (Wars), and her sister Limos (Famine) as all being punishments for those who &quot;foster&quot; Hybris:
=== Aeschylus===
Among the tragic poets, the use of &quot;atē&quot; and (thus) Ate is somewhat different than it is in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In both Homer and tragedy, &quot;atē&quot; can be used to mean the original delusion as well as the resulting destruction. However, while Homer was more focused on the former, tragedy became more focused on the latter. In tragedy, &quot;atē&quot; came to be less associated with internal damage: a damaged mind, and more with external damage: ruin, disaster, destruction. Here, Ate can be seen as an avenger of evil actions and a just punisher of evil actors, similar to Nemesis and the Erinyes (Furies).

Ate was particularly prominent in the plays of Aeschylus, and less so in the later tragedians such as Euripides, where the idea of Dike (Justice) becomes more fully developed. Personified Ate appears several times in Aeschylus&#x27; tragedy &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, where she is called &quot;scheming&quot;, and made the mother of an &quot;unendurable child&quot;, the &quot;miserable&quot; Peitho (Temptation). Aeschylus also associates Ate with divine retribution: Zeus&#x27; punishment inflicted on Troy for Paris&#x27;s abduction of Helen. In a long speech about Helen, the Chorus likens her to a lion cub raised as a loved and loving pet which ends up savagely killing those who raised it, the cub (and by extension Helen) being reared, by divine intent, as a &quot;priest&quot; of Ate. The Chorus goes on to describe Ate as:
In the final scene of the play, Clytemnestra, with bloody sword and clothes, emerges from the palace to reveal that she has killed her husband Agamemnon, in retribution for his having killed their daughter Iphigenia. She describes her act as the &quot;Justice&quot; [Dike] due for the killing of Iphigenia, and that she was aided by &quot;Ruin&quot; [Ate] and &quot;Fury&quot; [Eryns].

In Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Libation Bearers&quot;, Ate is explicitly said to be the agent of Zeus&#x27; justice:
Ate also occurs twice in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Persians&quot;. At the beginning of the play, the Chorus of Persian elders voice their foreboding on their war with Greece:
Ate here represents both cause and effect. She begins by deceiving and misleading mortals, and ends by the mortals being caught in &quot;her&quot; inescapable net. While, at the end of the play, Aeschylus returns to his typical focus of Ate as disastrous consequence, having the Chorus lament their devastating defeat: &quot;What an evil eye Ruin [Ate] has cast upon us!&quot;

At the end of the battle in Aeschylus&#x27;s &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, Ate&#x27;s &quot;trophy&quot; stands at the gate of Thebes where both of Orestes&#x27; sons have died killing each other in battle, representing the final victory of the &quot;powers of destruction&quot; over the cursed House of Laius.

===Other===
There are several other references to Ate in ancient Greek sources. A fragment attributed to one of the two lyric poets of early sixth-century Lesbos:
Sappho or Alcaeus, refers to Ate as &quot;insatiable&quot;. A fragment of the fifth-century BC philosopher Empedocles refers to the &quot;meadow of Ate&quot;, which probably signifies the mortal world. The fifth-century BC Greek epic poet Panyassis associated Ate (along with Hybris, the personification of insolence) with excessive drinking. According to Panyassis, the first round of wine, is for the Graces (the goddesses of beauty), Horae (the goddesses of good order), and Dionysus (the god of wine), while the second round, is for Aphrodite (goddess of love), and Dionysus again. But the third round is when &quot;Hybris and Ate take their unlovely turn&quot;, bringing &quot;good hospitality to a bad end&quot;.

In his third-century BC epic poem the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, about the adventures of Jason and the Argonauts, Apollonius of Rhodes has Hera say that &quot;even the gods are sometimes visited by Ate&quot;. In Nonnus&#x27;s fifth-century AD epic poem &quot;Dionysiaca&quot;, in order to gratify Hera, Ate persuades the boy Ampelus whom Dionysus passionately loves, to impress Dionysus by riding on a bull from which Ampelus subsequently falls and breaks his neck. In Quintus Smyrnaeus&#x27;s in his third-century AD &quot;Posthomerica&quot;, associates Ate with the punishment of insolence:
==Shakespeare==
In the play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Shakespeare introduces the goddess Ate as an invocation of vengeance and menace. Mark Antony, lamenting Caesar&#x27;s murder, envisions:
Shakespeare also mentions her in the play &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, when Benedick says, referring to Beatrice,
So too, in &quot;King John&quot;, Shakespeare refers to Queen Eleanor as &quot;An Ate stirring him to blood and strife&quot;, and, in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, Birone jeers &quot;Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them on, stir them on!&quot;

<text>In Greek mythology, Litae (; Ancient Greek: Λιταί means &#x27;prayers&#x27;) were personifications of prayers offered up in repentance and were ministers of the god Zeus. They were described as hobbling, old women. Their opposite number was Ate, the spirit of delusion and folly, in whose wake they followed.

== Family ==
Homer describes them as &quot;kourai&quot; &quot;maidens&quot; of Zeus rather than &quot;thugateres&quot; &quot;daughters&quot;, so it is not clear if they were his literal daughters.

This is supported by Quintus Smyrnaeus, who attests that they were the children of the king of the gods:(Paris addresses his former wife Oinone): &#x27;Remember not those pangs of jealousy, nor leave me by a cruel doom to die low fallen at thy feet! This should offend the Litai (Prayers), the daughters of the Thunderer Zeus, whose anger followeth unrelenting pride with vengeance, and the Erinnys (Fury) executes their wrath.&#x27;

== Mythology ==
They appear in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; in Book 9 as the lame and wrinkled daughters of Zeus who follow after Zeus&#x27; exiled daughter Atë (&quot;Folly&quot;) as healers but who cannot keep up with the fast-running Atë. They bring great advantage to those who venerate them, but if someone dishonors them, they go to Zeus and ask that Atë be sent against that person.The very immortals can be moved; their virtue and honour and strength are greater than ours are, and yet with sacrifices and offerings for endearment, with libations and with savour men turn back even the immortals in supplication, when any man does wrong and transgresses. For there are also Litai (Spirits of Prayer), the daughters (&quot;kourai&quot;) of great Zeus, and they are lame of their feet, and wrinkled, and cast their eyes sidelong, who toil on their way left far behind by the spirit of Ruin (Ate): but she, Ate (Ruin), is strong and sound on her feet, and therefore far outruns all Litai (Prayers), and wins into every country to force men astray; and the Litai (Prayers) follow as healers after her. If a man venerates these daughters of Zeus as they draw near, such a man they bring great advantage, and hear his entreaty; but if a man shall deny them, and stubbornly with a harsh word refuse, they go to Zeus, son of Kronos, in supplication that Ate (Ruin) may over take this man, that he be hurt, and punished. So Akhilleus: grant, you also, that Zeus&#x27; daughters be given their honour, which, lordly though they be, curbs the will of others.This is an obvious allegory on the supposed power of prayer to mitigate the misfortunes into which one&#x27;s folly has led one.

<text>Roger II or Roger the Great (, , Greek: Ρογέριος; 22 December 1095 – 26 February 1154) was King of Sicily and Africa, son of Roger I of Sicily and successor to his brother Simon. He began his rule as Count of Sicily in 1105, became Duke of Apulia and Calabria in 1127, then King of Sicily in 1130 and King of Africa in 1148.

==Background==
By 999, Norman adventurers had arrived in southern Italy. By 1016, they were involved in the complex local politics, where Lombards were fighting against the Byzantine Empire. As mercenaries they fought the enemies of the Italian city-states, sometimes fighting for the Byzantines and sometimes against them, but in the following century they gradually became the rulers of the major polities south of Rome. 

Roger I ruled the County of Sicily at the time of the birth of his youngest son, Roger, at Mileto, Calabria, in 1095. Roger I&#x27;s nephew, Roger Borsa, was the duke of Apulia and Calabria, and his great nephew, Richard II of Capua, was the prince of Capua. Alongside these three major rulers were a large number of minor counts, who effectively exercised sovereign power in their own localities. These counts at least nominally owed allegiance to one of these three Norman rulers, but such allegiance was usually weak and often ignored.

When Roger I died in 1101, his young son Simon became count, with his mother Adelaide del Vasto as regent. Simon died four years later in 1105 at the age of 12. Adelaide continued as regent to her younger son Roger, who was nine.

==Reign==

===Rise to power in Sicily===
 Upon the death in 1105 of his elder brother, Simon of Hauteville, Roger inherited the County of Sicily under the regency of his mother, Adelaide del Vasto, and his brother-in-law, Robert of Burgundy (d. 1112), son of Robert the Old. His mother was assisted by such notables as Christodulus, the Greek emir of Palermo. In 1109, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos bestowed upon him the title of &quot;protonobilissimos&quot; in recognition of his knowledge of the Byzantine court. In the summer of 1110, Roger was visited by the Norwegian king Sigurd the Crusader, who was on his way to Jerusalem. The story in Icelandic sources suggests that Sigurd called Roger the king of Sicily twenty years before the latter actually obtained this title.

In 1112, at the age of sixteen, Roger began his personal rule, being named &quot;now knight, now count of Sicily and Calabria&quot; in a charter document dated 12 June 1112. In 1117, his mother, who had married Baldwin I of Jerusalem, returned to Sicily, since the patriarch of Jerusalem had declared the marriage invalid. Roger seems to have felt the slight, and this might explain his later reluctance to go crusading. Roger married his first wife, Elvira, daughter of King Alfonso VI of Castile and, later, his fourth wife, Isabella, who may be identical to his former concubine, the converted Moor, Zaida, who was baptized with the name of Isabella.

In 1122, Duke William II of Apulia, who was fighting with Count Jordan of Ariano, offered to renounce his remaining claims to Sicily as well as part of Calabria. Roger, in exchange, provided William with 600 knights and access to money for his campaign.

===Rise to power in southern Italy===
When William II of Apulia died childless in July 1127, Roger claimed all Hauteville family possessions in the peninsula as well as the overlordship of the Principality of Capua, which had been nominally given to Apulia almost thirty years earlier. However, the union of Sicily and Apulia was resisted by Pope Honorius II and by the subjects of the duchy itself.

====Royal investiture====
The popes had long been suspicious of the growth of Norman power in southern Italy, and at Capua in December, the pope preached a crusade against Roger, setting Robert II of Capua and Ranulf II of Alife (his own brother-in-law) against him. After this coalition failed, in August 1128 Honorius invested Roger at Benevento as Duke of Apulia. The baronial resistance, backed by Naples, Bari, Salerno, and other cities whose aim was civic freedom, gave way. In September 1129 Roger was generally recognized as duke of Apulia by Sergius VII of Naples, Robert of Capua, and the rest. He began at once to enforce order in the duchy, where ducal power had long been fading.

On the death of Pope Honorius in February 1130 there were two claimants to the papal throne. Roger supported Antipope Anacletus II against Innocent II. The reward was a crown, and, on 27 September 1130, Anacletus&#x27; papal bull made Roger king of Sicily. He was crowned in Palermo on Christmas Day 1130.

==== The Royal Mantle of Roger II ====
Roger II&#x27;s elaborate royal mantle bears the year 528 of the Islamic calendar (1133–34); therefore it could not have been used for his coronation. This lavish item, made for special events to show power and regality, was most likely worn as a symbol of the Norman&#x27;s victory and new dynasty in Sicily. It was later used as a coronation cloak by the Holy Roman Emperors and is now in the Imperial Treasury (Schatzkammer) in Vienna.

The mantle is an example of the Normans&#x27; multicultural court and a mark of trade in Palermo. It is a luxury object made from red silk imported from the Byzantine Empire, its outer panels embellished with gold embroidery, pearls, enamel and jewels. The lining panels are separated into five sections made from three separate silks, each woven with gold. The pearls are from the Persian Gulf, with thousands outlining each section of the embroidery. Pearls were a common decoration on pan-Mediterranean textiles, but were also used and admired on clothing of the Byzantine Empire. The enameled surfaces are also attributed to the Byzantine Empire, as they had many craftsmen specializing in this type of work. The gold embroidery was most likely created by Muslim craftsmen, given the tiraz bands, the Arabic text in calligraphy, and Kufic script. The piece was made in a private royal workshop, dedicated to creating tiraz fabric and other royal garments. It is one of few surviving mementos of Fatimid-style royal garb preserved in its entirety.

The inscription written in the tiraz band along the bottom of the piece states, &quot;Here is what was created in the princely treasury, filled with luck, eminence, majesty, perfection, long-suffering, superiority, welcome, prosperity, liberality, brilliance, pride, beauty, the fulfillment of desires and hopes, the pleasure of days and nights, without cease or change, of glory, devotion, preservation of protection, luck, salvation, victory and capability, in the capital of Sicily, in the year 528 H. [1133–1134]&quot; This mantle was made to promote status, bring the wearer good fortune, and to emphasize Roger II&#x27;s regal power.

In addition to its lavish decoration and color, the mantle uses striking imagery to convey Roger II&#x27;s power and victory over the previous dynasty. In a scene evoking domination through primal violence, two lions, a heraldic symbol of a powerful, male ruler, each attack a camel, addorsed on either side of a central palm tree. The lions are stylized rather than realistically portrayed. There are also evocations of the cosmos and constellations in the star shapes on the lions&#x27; heads. The mantle&#x27;s pan-Mediterranean influence is brought out in the materials used to create it, the way it was made, and its design.

====Peninsular rebellions====
Roger&#x27;s backing of Anacletus plunged him into a ten-year war. Bernard of Clairvaux, Innocent&#x27;s champion, organized a coalition against Anacletus and his &quot;half-heathen king&quot;. He was joined by Louis VI of France, Henry I of England, and Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor. Meanwhile, southern Italy revolted.

In 1130, the Duchy of Amalfi revolted and in 1131, Roger sent John of Palermo across the Strait of Messina to join up with a royal troop from Apulia and Calabria and march on Amalfi by land while George of Antioch blockaded the town by sea and set up a base on Capri. Amalfi soon capitulated.

In 1132, Roger sent Robert II of Capua and Ranulf II of Alife to Rome in a show of force in support of Anacletus. While they were away, Roger&#x27;s half-sister Matilda, Ranulf&#x27;s wife, fled to Roger claiming abuse. Simultaneously, Roger annexed Ranulf&#x27;s brother&#x27;s County of Avellino. Ranulf demanded the restitution of both wife and countship. Both were denied, and Ranulf left Rome against orders, with Robert following.
First Roger dealt with a rebellion in Apulia, where he defeated and deposed Grimoald, Prince of Bari, replacing him with his second son Tancred. Meanwhile, Robert and Ranulf took papal Benevento. Roger went to meet them but was defeated at the Battle of Nocera on 25 July 1132. He retreated to Salerno.

The next year, Lothair III came down to Rome for his imperial coronation. The rebel leaders met him there, but they were refused help because Lothair&#x27;s force was too small. With the emperor&#x27;s departure, divisions in his opponents&#x27; ranks allowed Roger to reverse his fortunes. By July 1134, his troops had forced Ranulf, Sergius, and the other ringleaders to submit. Robert was expelled from Capua and Roger installed his third son, Alfonso of Hauteville, as Prince of Capua. Roger II&#x27;s eldest son Roger was given the title of Duke of Apulia.

Meanwhile, Lothair&#x27;s contemplated attack upon Roger had gained the backing of the Republic of Pisa, the Republic of Genoa, and the Byzantine emperor John II, each of whom feared the growth of a powerful Norman kingdom. A Pisan fleet led by the exiled prince of Capua dropped anchor off Naples in 1135. Ranulf joined Robert and Sergius there, encouraged by news coming from Sicily that Roger was fatally ill or even already dead. The important fortress of Aversa, among others, passed to the rebels and only Capua resisted, under the royal chancellor, Guarin. On 5 June, however, Roger disembarked in Salerno, much to the surprise of all the mainland provinces. The royal army, split into several forces, easily conquered Aversa and even Alife, the base of the natural rebel leader, Ranulf. Most of the rebels took refuge in Naples, which was besieged in July, but despite poor health conditions within the city, Roger was unable to take it, and returned to Messina late in the year.

====Imperial invasion====

In 1136, the long-awaited imperial army, led by Lothair and the Duke of Bavaria, Henry the Proud, descended the peninsula to support the three rebels. Henry, Robert, and Ranulf took a large contingent of troops to besiege the peninsular capital of the kingdom, Salerno. Roger remained in Sicily, leaving its mainland garrisons helpless under the chancellor Robert of Selby, while even the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus sent subsidies to Lothair. Salerno surrendered, and the large army of Germans and Normans marched to the very south of Apulia. There, in June 1137, Lothair besieged and took Bari. At San Severino, after the victorious campaign, he and the pope jointly invested Ranulf as Duke of Apulia in August 1137, and the emperor then retired to Germany. Roger, freed from the utmost danger, immediately disembarked in Calabria, at Tropea, with 400 knights and other troops, probably mostly Muslims. After having been welcomed by the Salernitans, he recovered ground in Campania, sacking Pozzuoli, Alife, Capua, and Avellino. Sergius was forced to acknowledge him as overlord of Naples and switch his allegiance to Anacletus. This moment marked the fall of an independent Neapolitan duchy, and thereafter the ancient city was fully integrated into the Norman realm.

From there Roger moved to Benevento and northern Apulia, where Duke Ranulf, although steadily losing his bases of power, had some German troops plus some 1,500 knights from the cities of Melfi, Trani, Troia, and Bari, who were &quot;ready to die rather than lead a miserable life&quot;. On 30 October 1137, at the Battle of Rignano (next to Monte Gargano), the younger Roger and his father, with Sergius of Naples, met the defensive army of Duke Ranulf. It was the greatest defeat of Roger II&#x27;s career. Sergius died and Roger fled to Salerno. It capped Ranulf&#x27;s meteoric career: twice victor over Roger. Anacletus II died in January 1138, but Innocent II refused to reconcile with the king.

In spring 1138, the royal army invaded the Principality of Capua, with the precise intent of avoiding a pitched battle and of dispersing Ranulf&#x27;s army with a series of marches through difficult terrain. While the Count of Alife hesitated, Roger, now supported by Benevento, destroyed all the rebels&#x27; castles in the region, capturing an immense booty. In April 1139, at the Second Council of the Lateran, Innocent II declared Roger excommunicated. Ranulf himself, who had taken refuge in his capital Troia, died of malarial fever on 30 April 1139. Roger exhumed his body from his grave in Troia cathedral and threw it in a ditch, only to repent subsequently and rebury him decently.

At this time, with Sergius dead, Alfonso was elected to replace him and together with his brother Roger went off to conquer the Abruzzi.

====Consolidation of kingship====
After the death of Anacletus in January 1138, Roger had sought the confirmation of his title from Innocent. However, the pope wanted an independent Principality of Capua as a buffer state between the Kingdom of Sicily and the Papal States, something Roger would not accept. In the summer of 1139, Innocent II invaded the kingdom with a large army, but was ambushed on 22 July 1139 at Galluccio, southeast of present-day Cassino, by Roger&#x27;s son and was captured. Three days later, by the Treaty of Mignano, the pope proclaimed Roger II &quot;rex Siciliae ducatus Apuliae et principatus Capuae&quot; (King of Sicily, Duke of Apulia and commander of Capua). The boundaries of his &quot;regno&quot; were only later fixed by a truce with the pope in October 1144. These lands were for the next seven centuries to constitute the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily.

In 1139, Bari, the 50,000 inhabitants of which had remained unscathed behind its massive walls during the wars of the past year, decided to surrender. The &quot;excellentissimus princeps&quot; Jaquintus, who had led the rebellion of the city, was hanged, along with many of his followers, but the city avoided being sacked. Roger&#x27;s execution of the prince and his counsellors was perhaps the most violent act of his life.

While his sons overcame pockets of resistance on the mainland, on 5 November 1139 Roger returned to Palermo to plan a great act of legislation: the Assizes of Ariano, an attempt to establish his dominions in southern Italy as a coherent state. He returned to check on his sons&#x27; progress in 1140 and then went to Ariano, a town central to the peninsular possessions (and a center of rebellion under his predecessors). There he promulgated the great law regulating all Sicilian affairs. It invested the king and his bureaucracy with absolute powers and reduced the authority of the often rebellious vassals. While there, centralising his kingdom, Roger declared a new standard coinage, named after the duchy of Apulia: the &quot;ducat.&quot;

===Economy===

Roger&#x27;s reforms in laws and administration aimed not only to strengthen his rule but also to improve the economic standing of Sicily and southern Italy. He was &quot;very concerned to gain money, but hardly very prodigal in expending it&quot;.

In 1140 at his assembly at Ariano he introduced new coinage including smaller denominations, to facilitate trade with the rest of the Mediterranean. However, although this new coinage made long-distance trade easier, it was detrimental to local trade, which spread &quot;hatred throughout Italy&quot;. By the 1150s most of this coinage was no longer in use and soon after, it disappeared altogether.

Nevertheless, the controversy over the coinage did not hinder the Kingdom&#x27;s prosperity. Roger II had acquired large wealth not only through his royal patrimony but also through his military campaigns and their financial rewards. For example, gold and silver were gained through the campaigns in Apulia in 1133 and Greece in 1147.

Sicily&#x27;s geographic situation at the centre of the Mediterranean favored trade with Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Its primary export was durum wheat; others included foods like cheese and vine fruits. Unlike other states, Sicily also had a strong political and military standing, so its merchants were supported and to some extent protected. This standing allowed for an increase in internal trade and a stronger market, which led to noticeable developments in agriculture.

===Later reign===

Roger had now become one of the greatest kings in Europe. At Palermo, he gathered round him distinguished men from a variety of ethnicities and cultures, such as the famous Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi and the Byzantine Greek historian Nilus Doxopatrius or Neilos Doxapatres. Sicily, in the center of the Mediterranean and a natural stopping point for people traveling across it, had been run by several different groups in its history, and Roger welcomed the learned and practiced tolerance toward the several religions, ethnicities and languages of his realm. To administer his domain he hired many Greeks and Arabs, who were trained in long-established traditions of centralized government. He was served by men of several nationalities, such as the Englishman Thomas Brun, a &quot;kaid&quot; of the &quot;Curia&quot;, and in the fleet by two Greeks, first Christodulus and then George of Antioch, whom he made in 1132 &quot;ammiratus ammiratorum&quot; or &quot;Emir of Emirs&quot;, in effect prime vizier. (This title later became the English word admiral). Roger made Sicily the leading maritime power in the Mediterranean.

A powerful fleet was built up under several admirals, or &quot;emirs&quot;, of whom the greatest was George, formerly in the service of the Muslim prince of Mahdia. Mainly thanks to him, a series of conquests were made on the African coast (1146–1153). From 1135 Roger II started to conquer the coast of Tunisia and enlarge his dominions: Tripoli was captured in 1146 and Cape Bona in 1148. These conquests were lost in the reign of Roger&#x27;s successor William, however, and never formed an integral part of the kingdom in southern Italy.

The Second Crusade (1147–1148) offered Roger an opportunity to revive attacks on the Byzantine Empire, the traditional Norman enemy to the East. It also afforded him an opportunity, through the agency of Theodwin, a cardinal ever-vigilant for Crusade supporters, to strike up a correspondence with Conrad III of Germany in an effort to break his alliance with Manuel I Comnenus. Roger himself never went on an expedition against Byzantium, instead handing command to the skillful George. In 1147, George set sail from Otranto with seventy galleys to attack Corfu. According to Nicetas Choniates, the island capitulated thanks to George&#x27;s bribes (and the tax burden of the imperial government), welcoming the Normans as their liberators. Leaving a garrison of 1,000 men, George sailed on to the Peloponnesus. He sacked Athens and quickly moved on to the Aegean Islands. He ravaged the coast all along Euboea and the Gulf of Corinth and penetrated as far as Thebes, where he pillaged the silk factories and carried off the damask, brocade, and silk weavers, taking them back to Palermo where they formed the basis for the Sicilian silk industry. George capped the expedition with a sack of Corinth, in which the relics of Saint Theodore were stolen, and then returned to Sicily. In 1149, however, Corfu was retaken. George went on a punitive expedition against Constantinople, but could not land and instead defied the Byzantine emperor by firing arrows against the palace windows. Despite this act, his expedition left no enduring effects.

Roger died at Palermo on 26 February 1154 and was buried in the Cathedral of Palermo. He was succeeded by his fourth son, William.

==Modern legacy==
Roger is the subject of &quot;King Roger&quot;, a 1926 opera by Polish composer Karol Szymanowski. The last months of his life are also featured in Tariq Ali&#x27;s book &quot;A Sultan in Palermo&quot;. Studiorum Universitas Ruggero II, a private non-traditional university connected to Accademia Normanna was incorporated in the U.S. on 30 April 2001 in his honor.

==Family==

Roger&#x27;s first marriage was in 1117 to Elvira, a daughter of King Alfonso VI of Castile. When she died, rumors flew that Roger had died as well, as his grief had made him a recluse. They had six children:

* Roger III (1118 – 12 May 1148), heir, Duke of Apulia (from 1135), possibly also Count of Lecce. 
* Tancred (1120–1138), Prince of Bari (from 1135). 
* William I (1120/1121 – 7 May 1166), his successor, Duke of Apulia (from 1148).
* Alfonso (1122 – 10 October 1144), Prince of Capua (from 1135) and Duke of Naples. 
* Adelisia (1126 - post 1184), regnant duchess of Florence. She married firstly Jozzelino, Count of Loreto, and secondly Robert III, Count of Loritello. 
* Henry (1130 - 1143), prince of Taranto. 

Roger&#x27;s second marriage was in 1149 to Sibylla, daughter of Hugh II, Duke of Burgundy. They had two children:

* Henry (29 August 1149 – died young)
* Stillborn child (16 September 1150)

Roger&#x27;s third marriage was in 1151 to Beatrice of Rethel, a grandniece of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. They had one daughter:

*Constance (born posthumously, 2 November 1154 – 28 November 1198), who married Emperor Henry VI and was later Queen of Sicily

Roger also had five known illegitimate children:

—By a daughter of Hugues I, Count of Molise:
* Simon, who became Prince of Taranto in 1144
—With unknown mistresses:
* A daughter, wife of Rodrigo Garcés (later Henry, Count of Montescaglioso)
* A daughter, wife of the Neapolitan nobleman Adam
* Clemenza, married Hugues II, Count of Molise
* Marina or Martina, married the admiral Margaritus of Brindisi

<text>Year 351 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Peticus and Crispinus (or, less frequently, year 403 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 351 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* Encouraged by a failed effort at invasion of Egypt by King Artaxerxes III, Phoenicia and Cyprus revolt against Persia.

==== Greece ====
* Demosthenes tries to get the Athenians to cease depending on paid mercenaries and return to the old concept of a citizen army. He also delivers his First Philippic, warning Athenians of the folly of believing that Philip&#x27;s ill health will save Athens from the Macedonians. In response, Athens&#x27; citizens vote for increased armaments.

==== Roman Republic ====

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Artaxerxes III and the Egyptian Revolt ==
In 351 BC, Artaxerxes III, the King of Persia, undertook a significant military campaign to reassert Persian control over Egypt, which had been in a state of revolt. The revolt was led by Nectanebo II, the last native pharaoh of Egypt&#x27;s 30th Dynasty. Artaxerxes III prepared a large and well-equipped army to invade Egypt. His strategy involved not only military might but also political and diplomatic maneuvers to weaken Egyptian resistance. In 351 BC, Artaxerxes III launched his invasion. The Persians initially faced strong resistance from Nectanebo II and his forces, who utilized Egypt’s natural defenses, such as the Nile Delta&#x27;s marshlands, to their advantage.

=== Outcome ===
Despite the initial successes of the Egyptian defense, the Persian forces gradually gained the upper hand. The details of the campaign are sparse, but it is known that by 343 BC, Artaxerxes III successfully subdued Egypt, marking the end of Nectanebo II’s reign and the last period of native rule until the Ptolemaic dynasty.

<text>Delos (; ; , ), is a small Greek island near Mykonos, close to the centre of the Cyclades archipelago. Though only in area, it is one of the most important mythological, historical, and archaeological sites in Greece. The ongoing excavations in the island are among the most extensive in the Mediterranean, and many of the artifacts found are displayed at the Archaeological Museum of Delos and the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.

Delos had a position as a holy sanctuary for a millennium before Olympian Greek mythology made it the birthplace of Apollo and Artemis. From its Sacred Harbour are visible the three conical mounds that have identified landscapes sacred to a goddess (presumably Athena). Another site, retaining its Pre-Greek name Mount Cynthus, is crowned with a sanctuary of Zeus.

In 1990, UNESCO added Delos to the World Heritage List, citing its exceptional archaeological site which &quot;conveys the image of a great cosmopolitan Mediterranean port&quot;, its influence on the development of Greek architecture, and its sacred importance throughout Ancient Greece.

==History==
===Ancient Greece===


Investigation of ancient stone huts found on the island indicate that it has been inhabited since the third millennium BC. Thucydides claims that the original inhabitants were piratical Carians who were eventually expelled by King Minos of Crete. By the writing of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the island was already famous as the birthplace of the twin gods Apollo and Artemis (although some confusion seems to exist of Artemis&#x27; birthplace being either Delos or the island of Ortygia). 

Between 900 BC and 100 AD, Delos was a major cult centre, where the gods Dionysus and Leto, mother of the twin deities Apollo and Artemis, were revered. Eventually acquiring Panhellenic religious significance, Delos was initially a religious pilgrimage for the Ionians.

A number of &quot;purifications&quot; were performed by the city-state of Athens in an attempt to render the island fit for the proper worship of the gods. The first took place in the sixth century BC, directed by the tyrant Pisistratus, who ordered that all graves within sight of the temple be dug up and the bodies moved to another nearby island. In the fifth century BC, during the sixth year of the Peloponnesian War and under instruction from the Delphic Oracle, the entire island was purged of all dead bodies. A new decree was eventually issued, so that no one should be allowed to be buried or give birth on the island due to its sacred importance, and to preserve its neutrality in commerce since no one could then claim ownership through inheritance. Immediately after this purification, the first quinquennial festival of the Delian games were celebrated there. Four years later, all inhabitants of the island were removed to Adramyttium in Asia as a further purification.

After the Persian Wars, the island became the natural meeting ground for the Delian League, founded in 478 BC, the congresses being held in the temple (a separate quarter was reserved for foreigners and the sanctuaries of foreign deities). The league&#x27;s common treasury was kept here as well until 454 BC, when Pericles removed it to Athens.

During the Hellenistic period, a well-established Phoenician colony on the island had extensive trade relations.

The island had no productive capacity for food, fiber, or timber, which were all imported. Limited water was exploited with an extensive cistern and aqueduct system, wells, and sanitary drains. Various regions operated &quot;agorae&quot; (markets).

Suda writes that the Greeks used the proverb &quot;ᾌδεις ὥσπερ εἰς Δῆλον πλέων&quot;, meaning you sing as if sailing into Delos in reference to someone who is happy, light-hearted, and enjoying himself.

Iamblichus writes that Delos Mysteries (similar to the Eleusinian Mysteries) were established.
===Roman era=== 
Strabo writes that in 166 BC, the Romans converted Delos into a free port, which was partially motivated by seeking to damage the trade of Rhodes, at the time the target of Roman hostility. In 167 or 166 BC, after the Roman victory in the Third Macedonian War, the Roman Republic ceded Delos to the Athenians, who expelled most of the original inhabitants. Roman traders came to purchase tens of thousands of slaves captured by the Cilician pirates or captured in the wars following the disintegration of the Seleucid Empire. It became the center of the slave trade, with the largest slave market in the larger region being maintained here.

The Roman destruction of Corinth in 146 BC allowed Delos to at least partially assume Corinth&#x27;s role as the premier trading center of Greece, but Delos&#x27; commercial prosperity, construction activity, and population waned significantly after the island was assaulted by the forces of Mithridates VI of Pontus in 88 and 69 BC, during the Mithridatic Wars with Rome. Before the end of the first century BC, trade routes had changed; Delos was replaced by Puteoli as the chief focus of Italian trade with the east, and as a cult centre, too, it entered a sharp decline. 

Despite its decline, Delos maintained some population in the early Roman Imperial period. Pausanias (8,33,2), writing in the second century AD, states that Delos was uninhabited apart from a few custodians of the sanctuaries. Evidence has been found of Roman baths, coins, an aqueduct, residential and elite houses, multiple churches, basilicas, and a monastery all from the first to sixth centuries AD, which, however, does not suggest that the island was continuously inhabited in the period. The pottery found indicates that produce, such as wine and oil, continued to be imported from regional centres. Also, a number of wine presses were found amidst the ruins of the ancient city that date to this period, suggesting that the population at this time was engaged in considerable viticultural endeavour.

Delos was eventually abandoned around the eighth century AD.

==Landmarks==

* The small sacred lake in its circular bowl, now intentionally left dry by the island&#x27;s caretakers to suppress the spread of malaria-bearing mosquitoes, is a topographical feature that determined the placement of later features.
* The Minoan Fountain was a rectangular public well hewn in the rock, with a central column; it formalized the sacred spring in its present sixth-century BC form, reconstructed in 166 BC, according to an inscription. Tightly laid courses of masonry form the walls; water can still be reached by a flight of steps that fill one side.
* Several market squares were found; the Hellenistic Agora of the Competaliasts by the Sacred Harbour retains the postholes for market awnings in its stone paving. Two powerful Italic merchant guilds dedicated statues and columns there.
* The Temple of the Delians, dedicated to Apollo, is a classic example of the Doric order. Beside the temple, once stood a colossal kouros of Apollo, only parts of which remain. Dating to the sixth century BC, parts of the upper torso and pelvis remain &quot;in situ&quot;, a hand is kept at the local museum, and a foot is in the British Museum.

* The Terrace of the Lions, also was dedicated to Apollo by the people of Naxos shortly before 600 BC. It originally had 9–12 squatting, snarling marble guardian lions along the Sacred Way; one was removed and is presently situated over the main gate of the Venetian Arsenal. The lions create a monumental avenue comparable to Egyptian avenues of sphinxes. (A Greek sphinx is in the Delos Museum.) Today, only seven of the original lions remain.
* The Oikos of the Naxians (House of the Naxians), first quarter of sixth century BC, has a long hall with one central ionic colonnade, a west porch tristyle in antis, and an east marble prostasis of the middle of the sixth century BC. 
* The Establishment of the Poseidoniasts, clubhouse of &quot;the Koinon of the Berytian Poseidoniast merchants, shipmasters, and warehousemen&quot;, during the early years of Roman hegemony, late 2nd century BC. To their protective triad of Baal/Poseidon, Astarte/Aphrodite and Eshmun/Asklepios, they added Roma.

* The Doric Temple of Isis was built on a high, overlooking hill at the beginning of the Roman period to venerate the familiar trinity of Isis, the Alexandrian Serapis, and Anubis.
* The Temple of Hera, &quot;circa&quot; 500 BC, is a rebuilding of an earlier Heraion on the site.
* The House of Dionysus is a luxurious second-century private house named for the floor mosaic of Dionysus riding a panther.
* The House of the Dolphins is similarly named from its atrium mosaic, where erotes ride dolphins; its Phoenician owner commissioned a floor mosaic of Tanit in his vestibule.
* The Stoivadeion dedicated to Dionysus bears a statue of the god of wine and the life-force. On either side of the platform, a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. The southern pillar, which is decorated with relief scenes from the Dionysiac circle, was erected around 300 BC to celebrate a winning theatrical performance. The statue of Dionysus was originally flanked by those of two actors impersonating &quot;Paposilenoi&quot; (conserved in the Archaeological Museum of Delos). The marble theatre is a rebuilding of an older one, undertaken shortly after 300 BC.
* The “Delos Synagogue”, the ruins of what was once believed to be an ancient Samaritan synagogue.

==Current population==
The 2001 Greek census reported a population of 14 inhabitants on the island. The island is administratively a part of the municipality of Mýkonos.

According to more recent numbers, in 2011 the island counted 24 inhabitants.

<text>Year 352 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====
* After two initial efforts, Philip II of Macedon drives the Phocians south after a major victory over them in the Battle of Crocus Field. Athens and Sparta come to the assistance of the Phocians and Philip is checked at Thermopylae. Philip does not attempt to advance into central Greece with the Athenians occupying this pass. With this victory, Philip accrues great glory as the righteous avenger of Apollo, since the Phocian general Onomarchos has plundered the sacred treasury of Delphi to pay his mercenaries. Onomarchos&#x27; body is crucified, and the prisoners are drowned as ritual demanded for temple-robbers.
* Philip then moves against Thrace. He makes a successful expedition into Thrace, gaining a firm ascendancy in the country, and brings away a son of Cersobleptes, the King of Thrace, as a hostage. Philip II&#x27;s Thessalian victory earns him election as president (archon) of the Thessalian League.

==== Rome ====

* Consuls: Publio Valerio Publicola &amp; Gaius Marcius Rutilus

*Dictator: Gaius Julius Iulus

<doc id="79086" wikidata="Q420269" url="?curid=79086" title="Arges (Cyclops)">
<text>Arges () was one of the three Hesiodic Cyclopes in Greek mythology. He was elsewhere called Acmonides or Pyracmon. His name means &quot;bright&quot; and represents the brightness from lightning.

== Birth and forging of the lightning bolt ==
Arges is a child of Gaia and Uranus, and his siblings include his fellow cyclopes, Brontes and Steropes, along with the Titans and the Hecatoncheires. After his birth, Uranus is said to have locked Arges and his cyclopes brothers in Tartarus out of fear, along with the Hundred Handed Ones. During the war between the Titans and the Gods, Arges, Brontes, and Steropes were freed to fashion lightning bolts for Zeus during his attempt to overthrow the gods. According to Apollodorus, Arges and his fellow cyclopes also fashioned the Helmet of Invisibility for Hades, and the trident for Poseidon. These weapons played a key role in the downfall of the Titans.

== Possible death ==
In Hesiod&#x27;s Catalogue of Women, the three Cyclopes, including Arges, are said to have been killed by Apollo in retaliation for his son Asclepius being killed by a lightning bolt. However, this contradicts Hesiod&#x27;s Theogony, which implies the cyclopes are immortal. The mythographer Pherecydes of Athens fixes this discrepancy by stating that the cyclopes&#x27; sons were killed by Apollo, rather than the cyclopes themselves. Another source suggests that Zeus killed the cyclopes to prevent them from making lightning bolts for anyone other than himself.

<text>Year 358 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Ambustus and Proculus (or, less frequently, year 396 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 358 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* Artaxerxes III (&quot;Ochus&quot;) succeeds Artaxerxes II as King of Persia and restores central authority over the Persian empire&#x27;s satraps. To secure his throne he puts to death most of his relatives. 

==== Greece ====

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* With the Persian empire weakening, revolts occur in many parts of the empire, including Sidon, a prosperous and rich Phoenician city.

==== Egypt ====
* The Egyptians under their King Teos and the Spartans under King Agesilaus II, with some Athenian mercenaries under their general Chabrias, set out to attack the Persian King&#x27;s Phoenician cities. However, they have to return almost at once due to revolts back in Egypt. Subsequently, Agesilaus II quarrels with the Egyptian king and joins a revolt against him.

==== Greece ====
* Callistratus of Aphidnae, an Athenian orator and general, and the Athenian general, Chabrias, are brought to trial in Athens on account of the refusal of the Thebans to surrender the city of Oropus, which on Callistratus&#x27; advice the Thebans have been allowed to occupy temporarily. Despite his magnificent oration in his defence (which so impresses Demosthenes that he resolves to study oratory), Callistratus is condemned to death. He flees to Methone in Macedonia, where he is accommodated by King Perdiccas III who draws on his financial expertise. Chabrias is acquitted and then accepts a command under the King of Egypt, Teos, who is defending his country against Persian attempts at reconquest.

==== Sicily ====
* Plato returns once more to Syracuse to teach the young Syracusan tyrant Dionysius II. He fails to reconcile the tyrant to Dion, who Dionysius II banished in 366 BC. Because of this, Plato is forced to flee Syracuse to save his life.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Agathocles, tyrant of Syracuse (d. 289 BC)

== Deaths ==
*Leosthenes, Athenian admiral

=== By place ===
==== Persian Empire ====
* The Persian generals Tiribazus and Orontes invade Cyprus, with an army far larger than any King Evagoras of Cyprus could raise. However, Evagoras manages to cut off this force from being resupplied, and the starving troops rebel. However, the war then turns in the Persians&#x27; favour when Evagoras&#x27; fleet is destroyed at the Battle of Citium (Larnaca, Cyprus). Evagoras flees to Salamis, where he manages to conclude a peace which allows him to remain nominally king of Salamis, though in reality he is a vassal of the Persian king.

==== Greece ====
* Sparta increases its hold on central Greece by reestablishing the city of Plataea, which Sparta formerly destroyed in 427 BC.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The district of Tusculum is pacified after a revolt against Rome, and then conquered. After an expression of complete submission to Rome, Tusculum becomes the first &quot;municipium cum suffragio&quot;, and thenceforth the city continues to hold the rank of a municipium.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Greece ====
* Sparta suppresses the Chalcidian League and imposes terms favourable to King Amyntas III of Macedonia.
* A small group of Theban exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrate the city of Thebes and assassinates the leaders of the pro-Spartan government. Epaminondas and Gorgidas lead a group of young men who break into the city&#x27;s armories, take weapons, and surround the Spartans on the Cadmea, assisted by a force of Athenian hoplites. In the Theban assembly the next day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas bring Pelopidas and his men before the audience and exhort the Thebans to fight for their freedom. The assembly responds by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators. Fearing for their lives, the Spartan garrison surrenders and are evacuated. The Thebans of the pro-Spartan party are also allowed to surrender; they are subsequently executed.
* The Thebans are able to reconstitute their old Boeotian confederacy in a new, democratic form. The cities of Boeotia unite as a federation with an executive body composed of seven generals, or Boeotarchs, elected from seven districts throughout Boeotia.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== Italy ====

* Rome sends colonists to Setia, the inhabitants complain that their numbers are too small. Publius and Gaius Manlius are assigned to the Volsicans for campaign. A defeat follows for the Romans after having been attacked in their camp and foraging parties being killed. The Roman soldiers do not waver even when they have no leader. A dictator is soon afterwards requested but the Volsicans do not know how to follow up a victory. At the end of the year the Parenestines inspire the Latin peoples to revolt.

<text>Maple is a symbolic and numeric computing environment as well as a multi-paradigm programming language. It covers several areas of technical computing, such as symbolic mathematics, numerical analysis, data processing, visualization, and others. A toolbox, MapleSim, adds functionality for multidomain physical modeling and code generation.

Maple&#x27;s capacity for symbolic computing include those of a general-purpose computer algebra system. For instance, it can manipulate mathematical expressions and find symbolic solutions to
certain problems, such as those arising from ordinary and partial differential equations.

Maple is developed commercially by the Canadian software company Maplesoft. The name &#x27;Maple&#x27; is a reference to the software&#x27;s Canadian heritage.

==Overview==
===Core functionality===
Users can enter mathematics in traditional mathematical notation. Custom user interfaces can also be created. There is support for numeric computations, to arbitrary precision, as well as symbolic computation and visualization. Examples of symbolic computations are given below.

Maple incorporates a dynamically typed imperative-style programming language (resembling Pascal), which permits variables of lexical scope. There are also interfaces to other languages (C, C#, Fortran, Java, MATLAB, and Visual Basic), as well as to Microsoft Excel.

Maple supports MathML 2.0, which is a W3C format for representing and interpreting mathematical expressions, including their display in web pages. There is also functionality for converting expressions from traditional mathematical notation to markup suitable for the typesetting system LaTeX.

===Architecture===
Maple is based on a small kernel, written in C, which provides the Maple language. Most functionality is provided by libraries, which come from a variety of sources. Most of the libraries are written in the Maple language; these have viewable source code. Many numerical computations are performed by the NAG Numerical Libraries, ATLAS libraries, or GMP libraries.

Different functionality in Maple requires numerical data in different formats. Symbolic expressions are stored in memory as directed acyclic graphs. The standard interface and calculator interface are written in Java.

==History==
The first concept of Maple arose from a meeting in late 1980 at the University of Waterloo. Researchers at the university wished to purchase a computer powerful enough to run the Lisp-based computer algebra system Macsyma. Instead, they opted to develop their own computer algebra system, named Maple, that would run on lower cost computers. Aiming for portability, they began writing Maple in programming languages from the BCPL family (initially using a subset of B and C, and later on only C). A first limited version appeared after three weeks, and fuller versions entered mainstream use beginning in 1982. By the end of 1983, over 50 universities had copies of Maple installed on their machines.

In 1984, the research group arranged with Watcom Products Inc to license and distribute the first commercially available version, Maple 3.3. In 1988 Waterloo Maple Inc. (Maplesoft) was founded. The company&#x27;s original goal was to manage the distribution of the software, but eventually it grew to have its own R&amp;D department, where most of Maple&#x27;s development takes place today (the remainder being done at various university laboratories).
In 1989, the first graphical user interface for Maple was developed and included with version 4.3 for the Macintosh. X11 and Windows versions of the new interface followed in 1990 with Maple V. In 1992, Maple V Release 2 introduced the Maple &quot;worksheet&quot; that combined text, graphics, and input and typeset output. In 1994 a special issue of a newsletter created by Maple developers called &quot;MapleTech&quot; was published.

In 1999, with the release of Maple 6, Maple included some of the NAG Numerical Libraries. In 2003, the current &quot;standard&quot; interface was introduced with Maple 9. This interface is primarily written in Java (although portions, such as the rules for typesetting mathematical formulae, are written in the Maple language). The Java interface was criticized for being slow; improvements have been made in later versions, although the Maple 11 documentation recommends the previous (&quot;classic&quot;) interface for users with less than 500 MB of physical memory.

Between 1995 and 2005 Maple lost significant market share to competitors due to a weaker user interface. With Maple 10 in 2005, Maple introduced a new &quot;document mode&quot; interface, which has since been further developed across several releases.

In September 2009 Maple and Maplesoft were acquired by the Japanese software retailer Cybernet Systems.

==Examples of Maple code==
The following code, which computes the factorial of a nonnegative integer, is an example of an imperative programming construct within Maple:
myfac := proc(n::nonnegint)
 local out, i;
 out := 1;
 for i from 2 to n do
 out := out * i
 end do;
 out
end proc;

Simple functions can also be defined using the &quot;maps to&quot; arrow notation:

 myfac := n -&gt; product(i, i = 1..n);
===Integration===
Find
:formula_1.

 int(cos(x/a), x);

Output:
:formula_2

===Determinant===

The same command can also solve systems of equations:

 f := (cos(x+y))^2 + exp(x)*y+cot(x-y)+cosh(z+x) = 0:

 g := x^5 - 8*y = 2:

 h := x+3*y-77*z=55;
 fsolve( {f,g,h} );

 {x = -2.080507182, y = -5.122547821, z = -0.9408850733}
===Plotting of function of single variable===

plot3d(x^2+y^2, x = -1..1, y = -1..1);

===Animation of functions===
* Animation of function of two variables
:formula_9

plots:-animate(subs(k = 0.5, f), x=-30..30, t=-10..10, numpoints=200, frames=50, color=red, thickness=3);

* Animation of functions of three variables

plots:-animate3d(cos(t*x)*sin(3*t*y), x=-Pi..Pi, y=-Pi..Pi, t=1..2);

* Fly-through animation of 3-D plots.

eqn:= f(x)-3*Int((x*y+x^2*y^2)*f(y), y=-1..1) = h(x):
intsolve(eqn,f(x));

:formula_15

==Use of the Maple engine==
The Maple engine is used within several other products from Maplesoft:
* MapleNet allows users to create JSP pages and Java Applets. MapleNet 12 and above also allow users to upload and work with Maple worksheets containing interactive components.
* MapleSim, an engineering simulation tool.
* Maple Quantum Chemistry Package from RDMChem computes and visualizes the electronic energies and properties of molecules.

Listed below are third-party commercial products that no longer use the Maple engine:
* Versions of Mathcad released between 1994 and 2006 included a Maple-derived algebra engine (MKM, aka Mathsoft Kernel Maple), though subsequent versions use MuPAD.
* Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB contained a portion of the Maple 10 engine, but now uses MuPAD (starting with MATLAB R2007b+ release).
* Older versions of the mathematical editor Scientific Workplace included Maple as a computational engine, though current versions include MuPAD.

<text>In Greek mythology, the Titanomachy (; , Latin: &quot;Titanomachia&quot;) was a ten-year series of battles fought in Ancient Thessaly, consisting of most of the Titans (the older generation of gods, based on Mount Othrys) fighting against the Olympians (the younger generations, who would come to reign on Mount Olympus) and their allies. This event is also known as the War of the Titans, Battle of the Titans, Battle of the Gods, or just the Titan War. The war was fought to decide which generation of gods would have dominion over the universe; it ended in victory for the Olympian gods.

Greeks of the classical age knew of several poems about the war between the gods and many of the Titans. The dominant one, and the only one that has survived, is the &quot;Theogony&quot; attributed to Hesiod. The Titans also played a prominent role in the poems attributed to Orpheus. Although only scraps of the Orphic narratives survive, they show differences from the Hesiodic tradition.

==Conflict among the first gods==

The stage for the Titanomachy was set after the youngest Titan Cronus overthrew his own father, Uranus (Ουρανός, the sky and ruler of the cosmos), with the help of his mother, Gaia (Γαία, the earth).

Uranus drew the enmity of Gaia when he imprisoned six of her children — the three Hecatonchires (giants with 50 heads and 100 arms) and the three Cyclopes (also giants, each with a single eye in the middle of its forehead) — within her womb. Gaia created a great sickle, forged from adamantine, and hid it in a crevice on Mount Othrys. Gaia then proceeded to attempt to convince 12 of her other children from Uranus, who were known as the Titans, to castrate Uranus. Only Cronus was willing to do the deed, so Gaia gave him the adamantine sickle and positioned him in the same crevice that previously held his sickle.

When Uranus met to consort with Gaia on Mount Othrys, Cronus ambushed Uranus, and with the adamantine sickle, sliced off his genitals, casting them across the Mediterranean. After doing so, Cronus freed the imprisoned Hecatonchires and Cyclopes, by slicing open Gaia&#x27;s womb and promptly imprisoned them in Tartarus. Cronus also quickly imprisoned Uranus deep below Tartarus. In doing this, he became the Ruler of the Titans. But Uranus cursed Cronus so that Cronus&#x27;s own children would rebel against his rule, just as Cronus had rebelled against his own father. Uranus&#x27; blood that had spilled upon the earth gave rise to the Gigantes, Erinyes, and Meliae. From the mixture of blood and semen from his mutilated genitalia, Aphrodite arose from the sea where they landed in Cyprus.
Cronus took his father&#x27;s title of ruler of land, sky, and sea. He then secured his power by forcing his siblings to bow down to his will.

Cronus, paranoid of Uranus&#x27;s curse and fearing the end of his rule, now turned into the tyrant his father Uranus had once been, swallowing each of his children whole as they were born from his sister-wife Rhea. Rhea, who began to resent Cronus, managed to hide her youngest newborn child Zeus, by tricking Cronus into swallowing a magnetite rock, given to her by her mother Gaia, wrapped in a blanket instead. Rhea brought Zeus to a cave in Crete, where he was raised by Amalthea and the Meliae.

Upon reaching adulthood, Zeus masqueraded as Cronus&#x27; cupbearer. Once he had been established as a servant of Cronus, the Oceanid Metis gave Zeus a mixture of mustard and wine which would cause Cronus to vomit out his swallowed children, now grown. After freeing his siblings as well as the Hecatonchires and Cyclopes, Zeus led them in rebellion against the Titans.

==Zeus and his siblings take over Creation==
Zeus then waged a war against his father with his disgorged brothers and sisters as allies: Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades, and Poseidon. Zeus released the Hecatonchires and the Cyclopes from the earth (where they had been imprisoned by Cronus) and they allied with him as well. The Hecatonchires hurled stones. The Cyclopes forged for Zeus his iconic thunder and lightning, for Poseidon his trident and for Hades a helmet of darkness. Fighting on the other side allied with Cronus were the other Titans with the important exception of Themis and her son Prometheus who allied with Zeus (N.B. for Hesiod, Clymene is the mother of Prometheus). Atlas was second in command after Cronus. The war lasted ten years, but eventually Zeus and the other Olympians won. Zeus had the important Titans imprisoned in Tartarus much like Cronus did to his father, and the Hecatonchires were made their guards. Atlas was given the special punishment of holding up the sky. In some accounts, when Zeus became secure in his power he relented and gave the Titans their freedom.

Hyginus relates the Titanomachy differently: &quot;After Hera saw that Epaphus, born of a concubine, ruled such a great kingdom (Egypt), she saw to it that he should be killed while hunting, and encouraged the Titans to drive Zeus from the kingdom and restore it to Cronus (Saturn). When they tried to mount heaven, Zeus with the help of Athena, Apollo, and Artemis, cast them headlong into Tartarus. On Atlas, who had been their leader, he put the vault of the sky; even now he is said to hold up the sky on his shoulders.&quot;

The &quot;Iliad&quot; describes how following their victory, the three brothers divided the world amongst themselves: Zeus was given domain over the sky and the air and was recognized as ruler (also known as the Sky Father). Poseidon was given the sea and all the waters, whereas Hades was given the Underworld, the realm of the dead. Each of the other gods were allotted duties according to the nature and proclivities of each. The earth was left common to all to do as they pleased, even to run counter to one another, unless the brothers (Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades) were called to intervene.

==&quot;Titanomachy&quot;, the lost poem==
A somewhat different account of the Titanomachy appeared in a poem that is now lost. The poem was traditionally ascribed to Eumelus of Corinth, a semi-legendary bard of the Bacchiadae ruling family in archaic Corinth, who was treasured as the traditional composer of the &quot;Prosodion&quot;, the processional anthem of Messenian independence that was performed on Delos.

Even in Antiquity, many authors cited &quot;Titanomachia&quot; without an author&#x27;s name. The name of Eumelos was attached to the poem as the only name available. From the very patchy evidence, it seems that &quot;Eumelos&quot;&#x27; account of the Titanomachy differed from the surviving account of Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; at salient points. It was written in the late seventh-century BC at the earliest.

The &quot;Titanomachy&quot; was divided into two books. The battle of Olympians and Titans was preceded by some sort of theogony, or genealogy of the Primeval Gods, in which, the Byzantine writer John the Lydian remarked, the author of Titanomachy placed the birth of Zeus, not in Crete, but in Lydia, which should signify on Mount Sipylus.

<doc id="79105" wikidata="Q842151" url="?curid=79105" title="List of Sicilian monarchs">
<text>The monarchs of Sicily ruled from the establishment of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130 until the &quot;perfect fusion&quot; in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1816.

The origins of the Sicilian monarchy lie in the Norman conquest of southern Italy which occurred between the 11th and 12th century. Sicily, which was ruled as an Islamic emirate for at least two centuries, was invaded in 1071 by Norman House of Hauteville, who conquered Palermo and established a feudal county named the County of Sicily. The House of Hauteville completed their conquest of Sicily in 1091.

In 1130, the County of Sicily and the County of Apulia, ruled by different branches of the House of Hauteville, merged as the Kingdom of Sicily, and Count Roger II was crowned king by Antipope Anacletus II. In 1282, after the Sicilian Vespers, the kingdom split into separate states: the properly named &quot;Ultra Sicily&quot; (&quot;Siciliae ultra Pharum&quot;, Latin for &quot;Sicily over the Strait&quot;) and &quot;Hither Sicily&quot; (&quot;Siciliae citra&quot;, commonly called &quot;the Kingdom of Naples&quot;). Definitive unification occurred in 1816, when Ferdinand IV and III made the two entities into a single state, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.
==Kings of Sicily==
Roger II received royal investiture from Antipope Anacletus II in 1130 and recognition from Pope Innocent II in 1139. The Kingdom of Sicily, which by then comprised not only the island, but also the southern third of the Italian peninsula, rapidly expanded itself to include Malta and the Mahdia, the latter if only briefly.

Constance was married to the Emperor Henry VI and he pressed his claim to the kingdom from William II&#x27;s death, but only succeeded in displacing his wife&#x27;s family in 1194.

There is evidence that, during the baronial revolt of 1197, there was an attempt to make Count Jordan Lupin of Bovino king in opposition to Henry VI. He may even have been crowned and seems to have had the support of Constance, who had turned against her husband. In the end he was captured and executed. He is accepted as a pretender to the throne by modern historians Evelyn Jamison and Thomas Curtis Van Cleve.

Manfred was regent of Sicily for his nephew, the child Conrad II (&quot;Conradin&quot;), but took the crown in 1258, and continued to fight to keep the kingdom under the Hohenstaufen. In 1254 the pope, having declared the kingdom a Papal possession, offered the crown to the King of England&#x27;s son, Edmund Crouchback, but the English never succeeded in taking the kingdom. In 1262 the pope reversed his previous decision and granted the kingdom to the King of France&#x27;s brother, Charles of Anjou, who succeeded in dispossessing Manfred in 1266. Conradin continued his claim to the throne until his death by decapitation perpetrated by Charles of Anjou in 1268.

====House of Plantagenet====
Edmund Crouchback, son of King Henry III of England, claimed the Crown of Sicily between 1254 and 1263. Both he and his father took the claim very seriously, but it was completely ineffectual.

Peter III of Aragon, Manfred&#x27;s son in law, of the House of Barcelona, conquered the island of Sicily from Charles I in 1282 and had himself crowned King of Sicily. Thereafter the old Kingdom of Sicily was centred on the mainland, with capital at Naples, and although informally called Kingdom of Naples it was still known formally as &quot;Kingdom of Sicily&quot;. Thus, there were two &quot;Sicilies&quot; — the island kingdom, however, was often called &quot;Sicily beyond the Lighthouse&quot; or &quot;Trinacria&quot;, by terms of a treaty between the two states.

<doc id="79109" wikidata="Q857921" url="?curid=79109" title="Cyclops (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Cyclops is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and is a founding member of the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the comic book &quot;The X-Men&quot;. Cyclops is a member of a subspecies of humans known as mutants, born with superhuman abilities. Cyclops emits powerful beams of energy from his eyes and can only control the beams with the aid of special eyewear, which he must always wear. He is typically considered the first of the X-Men, a team of mutant heroes who fight for peace and equality between mutants and humans, and one of the team&#x27;s primary leaders.

The first-born son of Corsair, Scott Summers is the older brother of Havok and Vulcan. His first and most enduring love interest is his current wife, Jean Grey, with the two having a daughter, Rachel Summers, from an alternate future. Other significant love interests include his ex-wife Madelyne Pryor—a clone of Jean and mother of his son Cable—and fellow X-Man Emma Frost. Cyclops&#x27; archenemy is Mister Sinister, who is obsessed with the Summers and Grey bloodlines and has often manipulated events in Cyclops&#x27; life, resulting in various clashes with the X-Men.

Cyclops is most often portrayed as the archetypal hero of traditional American popular culture—the opposite of the tough, anti-authority antiheroes that emerged in American popular culture after the Vietnam War (e.g., Wolverine, his X-Men teammate).

James Marsden initially portrayed Cyclops in the 20th Century Fox &quot;X-Men&quot; films, and a younger version of the character was portrayed by Tim Pocock in the 2009 prequel film &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;. He also was portrayed by Tye Sheridan in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016) and &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; (2019), as well as a cameo in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018).

==Publication history==
Cyclops first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #1 (September 1963). He was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, and has been a mainstay character of the &quot;X-Men&quot; series. Lee said that Cyclops and Beast were his two favorite X-Men, elaborating that &quot;I love tortured heroes—and he was tortured because he couldn&#x27;t control his power.&quot; Originally dubbed &quot;Slim Summers&quot;, by &quot;The X-Men&quot; #3 his name was changed to &quot;Scott&quot;, with &quot;Slim&quot; becoming a nickname.

Scott Summers is the first of the X-Men recruited by Professor X; Xavier hand-picks Scott to lead his X-Men, and to carry on the legacy of his mutant-human-harmony ideals. Xavier views Scott as one of his most prized pupils; their relationship exhibits father/son qualities. From time to time, Scott&#x27;s extreme loyalty to Xavier has cost him dearly in his relationships with others; but, over the course of the characters&#x27; publication history, he eventually emerges from Xavier&#x27;s shadow as the X-Men&#x27;s undisputed leader.

Dave Cockrum created the Starjammers, including Corsair, and convinced &quot;X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont to use the characters for this series. In order to provide a plausible excuse for the Starjammers to make repeat appearances in &quot;X-Men&quot;, they decided to make Corsair the father of Cyclops.

Summers remained a member of the team up through &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #138. After departing the main cast, he was a recurring character in the series until &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #201, after which he was featured in the launch of a new series by Marvel. This new series, &quot;X-Factor&quot;, launched in 1986 and starred the original X-Men team of Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman, and Angel. Scott stayed with the &quot;X-Factor&quot; title through &quot;X-Factor&quot; #70. In October 1991, Summers returns to the X-Men to launch &quot;X-Men&quot; #1. This series was the second of two &quot;X-Men&quot; titles and featured Cyclops, Wolverine, Gambit, Psylocke, Rogue, and Beast as Blue team. Cyclops has recently been featured in another title launch with the second introduction of a new &quot;X-Men&quot; series &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;. &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; features Cyclops, Wolverine, Shadowcat, Colossus, Emma Frost, and Beast as a team. Throughout this time, Cyclops continued to make appearances in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; Marvel has also used Cyclops to launch variant series of &quot;X-Men&quot; titles most notably &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; and &quot;New X-Men&quot;.

Cyclops has appeared in limited series including &quot;Adventures of Cyclops &amp; Phoenix&quot;, &quot;Further Adventures of Cyclops &amp; Phoenix&quot;, &quot;X-Men: The Asgardian Wars&quot;, the second series of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, &quot;X-Men: The Search for Cyclops&quot;, his own self-titled series &quot;Cyclops&quot;, and &quot;X-Men Origins: Cyclops&quot; #1.

In 2000, Joseph Harris wrote the four-issue run titled &quot;X-Men: The Search for Cyclops&quot; that dealt with Cyclops&#x27;s return after merging with Apocalypse in the events of the Twelve from &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #377. In 1991, writer Brian K. Vaughan worked on the self-titled series &quot;Cyclops&quot; #1–4.

===21st century===
During Joss Whedon&#x27;s run of &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, Cyclops adopts a new attitude unfamiliar to most accustomed fans. After Emma Frost&#x27;s psychic intervention at the mansion, he temporarily loses his powers after owning up to his self-inflicted, traumatic past. This prompted an interview with Whedon in &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine #182. When asked if Cyclops did not have his powers anymore, Whedon replied:

Now, the X-Men leader has become more confident, outspoken, and audacious. This has had a significant effect on his leadership and his respect among teammates, most notably Wolverine.

However, since the birth of Hope Summers, Cyclops has become increasingly unstable with his own self. Overprotective of those close to him, amoral in his new, Magneto-like view of humanity, and mentally ambiguous, Cyclops is viewed as an antihero and occasionally even a villain in the minds of his fellow superheroes. Kieron Gillen&#x27;s run in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; ended with an unrepentant Cyclops, who had become increasingly hardline during Gillen&#x27;s run, in prison for his actions during &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot;, up to and including him killing Xavier while under the influence of the Phoenix Force. Gillen wrote him openly suicidal in a five-part epilogue: &quot;AvX: Consequences&quot;.

As part of Marvel NOW!, there are two Cyclopes: the original Cyclops is featured in volume 3 of &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;, which was launched in February 2013, and a younger time-displaced version as part of the All-New X-Men team, both series are written by Brian Michael Bendis and drawn by Chris Bachalo. Uncanny X-Men features the remnants of Cyclops&#x27; Extinction Team, who have taken up a revolutionary, and sometimes violent course to promote mutant rights, and started up a new school for new mutants, the New Charles Xavier School for the Gifted. The younger Cyclops tries to make sense of his future and find a place for himself, while deciding if he even wants to stay an X-Man.

In the new Dawn of X saga Cyclops has been given the role of Great Captain Commander. The X-Men Senior Editor Jordan D. White said regarding Cyclops role in Krakoa in an interview:

==Fictional character biography==
Cyclops&#x27;s history has undergone various revisions, both minor and major. The central fixed element is the character&#x27;s origin story. As a young boy, Scott Summers is orphaned after watching his parents die in a plane crash. Scott and his brother, Alex, were the only survivors as their parents placed the two boys in the only available parachute and forced them to jump from the plane just prior to crashing. The boys become wards of the state and are separated. When Scott&#x27;s powers manifest uncontrollably, he runs away from the orphanage and wanders before being taken in as ward by Charles Xavier.

=== Youth ===
When Scott was a young boy, his father, USAF Major Christopher Summers, took the family for a flight in their de Havilland Mosquito from his grandparents&#x27; home in Anchorage, Alaska, when it came under attack by an alien Shi&#x27;ar spaceship. As the plane went down in flames, Scott&#x27;s parents fastened him and his younger brother Alex into a parachute and pushed them off the plane, hoping that they would survive.

In Cyclops&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #1, he is already leading the X-Men under tutelage of Professor X. Later, Scott&#x27;s origin is first presented in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #38–42 and later refined in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #144 and &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #156. In 2010, Marvel released &quot;X-Men Origins: Cyclops&quot; #1 that describes the character&#x27;s childhood through his joining the X-Men.

The early accounts in the X-Men comics use flashbacks to tell the origin story of Scott parachuting from his parents&#x27; plane. The flashbacks are often told from various narrative perspectives and place different emphasis on the events of this period. Scott&#x27;s poor control over his power have been attributed to events in his childhood. In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #156, Scott&#x27;s parachute caught fire and Scott struck his head upon landing. This caused brain damage to Scott which is responsible for his poor control over his optic blasts. Several origin stories do not feature the head injury account with &quot;X-Men Origins: Cyclops&quot; #1 being the most recent. The head injury account has also been retconned in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; vol. 3 as being due to a self-imposed mental block he made as a child to deal with the traumatic events of his life. With the help of Emma Frost, Scott is able to briefly bypass his own mental block and control his powers, though he reveals that his control is waning and temporary.

For a time, Scott had prolonged amnesia about his childhood. Parts of his memory returned when he was unexpectedly attacked by the demon D&#x27;Spayre while on a leave of absence after Jean Grey&#x27;s perceived first death. Scott spent most of his childhood at the State Home for the Foundlings in Omaha, Nebraska and was subjected to batteries of tests and experiments by the orphanage&#x27;s owner, Mr. Milbury, an alias for the geneticist Mister Sinister, who also placed mental blocks on Scott.

=== Ancestry ===
In The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix limited series, both Scott and Jean were sent back in time to 19th century England by Madame Sanctity, a surviving member of the Askani sisterhood. In 1860, prior to the epilogue of the story, a young English orphan named Daniel (who was freed, one year ago, from the clutches of Nathaniel Essex by Scott and Jean) is shown arriving in New York Harbor from London. As a form of reverence toward the couple who recently showed him great kindness, when urged by his apparent guardian to adopt a new surname at the immigration station, Daniel chooses Summers. Although Scott does not make the familial connection between Daniel and himself, he suspects that his presence in this time (along with Jean&#x27;s) did something &quot;else&quot; to affect the course of history, aside from stopping Mister Sinister and Apocalypse.

=== The X-Men ===

When Scott is sixteen, he goes on a trip to New York with his orphanage supervisor. Scott walks near a construction site and his optic beam activates for the first time. The blast damages a metal crane causing it to fall towards an onlooking crowd. Scott thinks quickly unleashing a second blast that destroys the crane. The crowd thinks this is an act of violence, and forms a lynch mob. Scott hops onto a train and runs away. Wandering Scott encounters Jack O&#x27; Diamonds who tries to recruit Scott as a thief/villain but eventually battles the villain. Scott is found by Charles Xavier, directly after who erases the crowd&#x27;s memories. Xavier then asks Scott to join him and the X-Men, he gladly accepts, as the first official member.

In the X-Men&#x27;s first field mission, he battles Magneto. With the X-Men, he battles the Vanisher, Unus the Untouchable, the Blob, and many others. Xavier would soon choose him to be deputy leader of the team and act as field leader whenever he was absent.

Cyclops has a relationship with Jean Grey during their time in the &quot;original&quot; X-Men. For a long time, he refuses to admit, even to himself, that he has feelings for her, afraid he would be hurt again or that his optic blasts would hurt her – or anyone else he cared about for that matter – and also because he feels he is no match for his wealthy teammate Warren Worthington III, a.k.a. Angel, who is at first also romantically interested in Jean. What Scott does not know is that Jean actually has a crush on him, but is too shy to make a move. Finally, on Bobby Drake&#x27;s 18th birthday, they reveal their passion for each other and become lovers.

During one of the X-Men&#x27;s adventures he rediscovers his brother Alex as his powers were manifesting. Alex would join the team with Scott as Havok.

When the original team of X-Men are defeated by Krakoa, Cyclops is the only member able to escape and return to Xavier. He helps train a new group of X-Men, which includes Storm, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Banshee, Thunderbird, Sunfire and Wolverine to rescue the others. When the other original X-Men (Angel, Beast, Iceman, Jean Grey, and later additions Havok (his own brother Alex) and Polaris) decide to leave in light of the arrival of the new X-Men, Cyclops stays, feeling that he will never be able to lead a normal life because of the uncontrollable nature of his powers.

As an adult member of the X-Men, Cyclops unknowingly meets his father, now known as Corsair, leader of the Starjammers, a group of aliens opposing what they see as the tyranny of the Shi&#x27;ar empire. Jean learns of Corsair&#x27;s identity but keeps it from Scott and several more years pass before he learns his father&#x27;s true identity.
Cyclops privately questions his relationship with Jean after Jean dies trying to pilot a space shuttle through a solar flare, and then is reborn as Phoenix, feeling that this reborn Jean was not the same Jean he had loved. Yet when he thinks her dead for an extended period of time after a battle in the Savage Land, Scott is not able to mourn her, and believes this meant he did not really love her anymore. He briefly dates Colleen Wing. However, when Scott and Jean are reunited on Muir Island to fight Proteus, he rediscovers his love for her, and they share a passionate kiss on the way home. A few days before Jean dies, Scott psychically proposes, and she accepts. After her death, he quits the X-Men, unsure of what to do anymore. He signs on as crew of a fishing boat, captained by Lee Forrester. After an adventure in which Lee&#x27;s father is possessed by D&#x27;Spayre, Cyclops and the Man-Thing must fight D&#x27;Spayre, Scott and Lee find themselves shipwrecked in the Bermuda Triangle, where they stumble upon Magneto&#x27;s new base of operations.

Scott soon returns to the X-Men. He then discovers that Corsair the leader of the Space Pirate group the Starjammers is actually his father. Scott originally believed that his parents died in the plane accident and is unaware that they, in fact, had been captured and sold into slavery by the Shi&#x27;ar. His mother was murdered by then Emperor D&#x27;Ken, leaving a grieving Corsair to escape captivity and form the Starjammers. He also finds out through Corsair that he has living grandparents, who own a shipping company in Alaska. During his first visit to his grandparents he meets Madelyne Pryor, a woman who bears a strong resemblance to Jean. Eventually he marries her, and after she gets pregnant he retires from the X-Men. Scott has a difficult time adjusting to life outside of the X-Men and later, to his wife&#x27;s dismay, he challenges Storm to a battle in the Danger Room for leadership of the X-Men. Despite Storm no longer possessing her mutant powers, she defeats Cyclops. Madelyne gives birth to their son, Nathan, and Scott returns to retirement from the X-Men.

=== X-Factor and Inferno ===
Shortly after the birth of his son Nathan, Jean Grey is discovered and revived by the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. It is revealed that Jean Grey was alive and had never been The Phoenix. The Phoenix is revealed to have been a cosmic entity who placed a dying Jean Grey in a healing pod at the bottom of Jamaica Bay and replaced her taking on her appearance and memories, to the point of not realizing that &quot;she&quot; herself was not the real Jean Grey. After hearing that Jean is alive, Cyclops leaves his wife and son and rejoins the other original X-Men as X-Factor, who pose as mutant hunters but in reality are trying to help their genetic brethren. Meanwhile, Pryor goes on to be an assisting member of the X-Men, apparently sacrificing her life during the Fall of the Mutants with her teammates, although she was left with feelings of despair over the loss of Scott, who felt bad himself over the way he had handled the situation.

The demons S&#x27;ym and N&#x27;astirh corrupt Madelyne&#x27;s feelings of self-despair, transforming her into the Goblin Queen. Madelyne seeks revenge on Scott for leaving her. When it is revealed that she is a clone created by geneticist Mister Sinister, essentially for the purpose of becoming a brood mare, Madelyne cannot take it anymore and kills herself. Scott seemingly kills Sinister with an optic blast, and pursues a romance with Jean, reclaiming his son. Scott soon learns that Mister Sinister ran the orphanage in which Scott was raised, and battled Sinister over this.

Shortly after the X-Tinction Agenda, Scott reencounters Apocalypse, who infects Nathan with a techno-organic virus. Although Scott saves his son with the help of his teammates and through the combined strength of Nathan, Jean, and himself defeats Apocalypse, he was unable to save his son from the fatal infection. Distraught, Scott sends his son into the future where he can be cured.

Next, Xavier&#x27;s psionic enemy, Shadow King, returns to combat the X-Men and X-Factor. After his defeat, Cyclops and X-Factor rejoin the X-Men team, and Scott is named leader of a newly created &quot;Blue Team&quot;.

=== Return to the X-Men ===
After Cyclops&#x27;s return as field leader, much of the Blue team is kidnapped by Omega Red and the ninjas of The Hand. After the captured teammates&#x27; rescue, Mr. Sinister sends Caliban, a former X-Factor member, to kidnap Cyclops and Jean for Stryfe, a madman and rival to Cable, both time-lost mutants. Stryfe tells the two that he is Nathan, sent to the future and abandoned. In a fight, Cable and Stryfe apparently die. Afterwards, the team battles Omega Red again, and teammate and telepath Psylocke tries to lure Cyclops into an affair behind Jean&#x27;s back. Ultimately, however, Cyclops remains with Jean. Cable returns as well and reveals to Cyclops that he is the real Nathan Christopher Summers, while Stryfe is a clone of Nathan created in the event of his death who was stolen and raised by Apocalypse.

==== Second Marriage ====
Scott Summers and Jean Grey finally marry. During their honeymoon, they are brought into the future where they raise Cable for the first 12 years of his life during &quot;The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix&quot; miniseries. After helping Cable defeat the future version of Apocalypse, they are sent back to the past. At the request of Rachel Summers, Jean assumes the Phoenix identity. Mister Sinister, involved with the machinations of Apocalypse and Stryfe and still alive, tells Cyclops that there is another Summers brother, and leaves him wondering.

As Cyclops deals with the fact that his son is now old enough to be his father, the X-Men are forced to battle their mentor when Professor Xavier is transformed into the evil Onslaught, as a result of his recent attempt to wipe Magneto&#x27;s mind causing Magneto&#x27;s darker impulses to merge with Xavier&#x27;s own subconscious darkness and manifest as a new personality. Although the X-Men defeat the evil entity and free Xavier, most of Earth&#x27;s heroes are lost for a time. Xavier, who is left powerless after Onslaught&#x27;s defeat, is arrested for his part, leaving Scott and Jean as leaders and co-headmasters of the school. However, the pair go into retirement following , in which Cyclops is gravely injured when a bomb is placed in his chest.

==== Merging with Evil ====
Scott and Jean return to the X-Men sometime after at the request of Storm, when she grows concerned about the mental well-being of Professor X (who had returned sometime prior). Their return then leads to the events of , in which Apocalypse plans to use a machine to steal the powers of twelve select mutants and the body of Nate Grey which will make him virtually omnipotent. In order to save Nate, Cyclops willingly merges with the villain Apocalypse. He is believed dead until Jean and Cable track him down to Egypt and separate him from Apocalypse, killing Apocalypse&#x27;s spirit in the process.

=== &quot;New X-Men&quot; ===
Upon Cyclops&#x27; return to the X-Men following his possession, his personality has been altered as a result of being bonded with Apocalypse. This change causes a rift between him and Jean; he claims that Apocalypse made him question not only their relationship, but his life as a whole. He is instrumental in preventing the mutant Xorn&#x27;s suicide and in recruiting the powerful mutant to the X-Men. The two establish a close friendship; similarly, repeated missions with Wolverine result in the growth of a tentative friendship between the two veteran X-Men.

When Jean begins to show signs of the Phoenix Force again, the distance between the two grows larger and Scott begins abstaining from sex with Jean for the five months. Jean attempts several times to confront Cyclops, but he continues to push her away, claiming that Apocalypse had changed him too much on the inside. Jean, confused by the change in their relationship, confides in Logan and the two kiss in the woods outside the school, but Logan walks away telling her that she should remain with Scott. Xavier leaves Earth while under the control of Cassandra Nova and Jean is left as Headmistress of the school. Her new responsibilities along with her growing powers, force Jean to put her attention elsewhere leaving Scott feeling ignored and his trauma from being possessed trivialized. Instead of attempting to reconcile with her, Scott turns to Emma Frost for consolation, feeling that he can talk to Emma about his problems. Their relationship ostensibly begins as a series of psychic therapy sessions, but the two soon engage in a full-fledged psychic affair.

When Phoenix discovers the affair, Cyclops claims he and Emma shared only thoughts and thus had done nothing wrong. Meanwhile, Emma&#x27;s snide and mocking jeers provoke a hurt and angry Jean to psychically confront her, using the full power of the Phoenix Force to &#x27;burn through lies&#x27;. She forces Emma to admit her true feelings for Scott, and to face her many failures, sins, and personal demons. Furious at both himself and Jean, Scott confronts Jean and demands that she read his mind; Jean finally complies, only to discover that Scott and Emma never engaged in any physical contact, though Emma had offered it. After confronting Jean with the truth, Scott leaves the Xavier Institute, and a short time later Emma is found shattered in her diamond form and believed killed.

Scott soon finds himself at the Hellfire Club which had been turned into a sleazy strip club and tries to get drunk, attempting to escape the responsibilities, expectations, and demands which he feels are unjustly placed on him by the X-Men. He then accompanies Wolverine and Fantomex to the government-created time-pocket called The World and then Asteroid M. During his time with Wolverine, Scott reveals that he feels his relationship with Jean is stagnant and that the two of them had not progressed romantically since their initial teenage romance. He also confesses that he feels that Jean is so concerned with the school and her new powers that the two no longer communicate like before and that he feels left behind due to Jean once again being connected to the Phoenix Force. When Scott finally returns to the X-Men, their new teammate Xorn (who was revealed to be Magneto, but was subsequently retconned as an imposter) attacks the X-Men. Having at last reached full Phoenix power, Jean confronts Xorn-Magneto and is killed in the process. As she is dying, Scott apologizes for hurting her, but Jean instead tells him that she understands and has never seen him more alive and urges him to live on.

=== Headmaster ===
Scott, however, is devastated by Jean&#x27;s death, and considers leaving the X-Men once more. It was revealed in the &quot;Here Comes Tomorrow&quot; storyline that, had he done so, it would have led to an apocalyptic alternate future. To prevent this, a resurrected, future-version of Jean uses her powers as the White Phoenix of the Crown and telepathically reached back in time to tell Cyclops it was okay to move on, leading him to start a real relationship with Emma. Together, the pair rebuild the Xavier Institute as co-headmasters.

The new relationship between Emma and Scott leads to problems between them and the rest of the X-Men, all of whom believe that the pair are doing Jean&#x27;s memory a disservice. Rachel Summers in particular feels hurt and angry by her father&#x27;s lack of remorse for the psychic affair that hurt Jean before her death and Emma&#x27;s part in it, and takes on the last name of Grey in place of Summers. The other X-Men eventually come to accept the relationship and both Scott and Emma manage to reconcile with Rachel in their own ways, such as introducing Rachel to Jean&#x27;s other family members.

Deciding that the X-Men need to play more of a role in emergency rescue and aid, and thus garner attention on mutants in a more positive light where mutant abilities are used for the good of people, Cyclops hand-picks a new team in &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; of himself, Emma, Beast, Kitty Pryde, and Wolverine, which is subsequently used by Marvel as the chief representation of the X-Men. The team faces an alien named Ord of the Breakworld, who supplies Earth scientist Dr. Kavita Rao with a &quot;cure&quot; for mutation. The team subdue Ord and rescue the resurrected Colossus, but not before learning that one of their own will be responsible for the destruction of Ord&#x27;s homeworld in the coming year. Not long after, the X-Men&#x27;s Danger Room becomes sentient, attacking the X-Men and seeking to ultimately kill Xavier. Calling itself &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;she&quot; reveals that Xavier knew she had been self-aware since Shi&#x27;ar technology was installed in the Danger Room years ago, but chose to ignore her, effectively inhumanely using her only to train his teams of X-Men. After her defeat on the island of Genosha, the X-Men abandoned Xavier in disgust, with Cyclops no longer welcoming Xavier&#x27;s input at the School or with the team.

Cyclops also tutored a squad at the institute called The Corsairs, named after Cyclops&#x27;s father. The team consisted of Dryad, Quill, Specter, and the three remaining Stepford Cuckoos.

=== &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; ===
In &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; vol. 3 #14, during an impromptu telepathic &quot;therapy session&quot;, Emma Frost presented Cyclops with the possibility that his lack of control over his optic blasts actually stems not from physical brain damage, but from a sort of mental block that the young Scott imposed upon himself after the combined traumas of the loss of his parents, separation from his brother, and shocking manifestation of his powers; this is seen as a coping mechanism, giving Scott something to focus on and try to maintain some sort of control over at a time when events completely out of his control had effectively shattered the life he had led up to that point.

Scott admits that this theory is the truth, further admitting that he had blocked making this decision out of his memory, to preserve the fallacy in his own mind and prevent others from discovering his &quot;secret&quot;. The issue ends with Scott apparently in a catatonic state, with his eyes uncovered and displaying their natural shade of brown, with no evidence of his powers manifesting. Later he manifests, and has full control over his optical blasts, although it was only temporary.

=== Deadly Genesis ===

After the events of House of M, nearly all mutants were left depowered, and Xavier was missing. A mysterious villain then attacked and easily defeated several members of the team, including Cyclops and his alternate-reality daughter, Rachel. The two were captured and taken to an undisclosed location, which Cyclops vaguely remembered visiting in the past. Eventually managing to free themselves, Cyclops and Rachel attempted to escape, only to run into their captor (revealed to be Vulcan), who informed Cyclops that he was the X-Man&#x27;s younger brother. A powerless Professor Xavier confirmed this information in the final book of the miniseries. This new information has left Cyclops resentful towards his mentor and has gone so far as to demand that Xavier leave the school as it is no longer &#x27;his&#x27;.

=== Civil War ===

Cyclops, along with the other living original X-Men, declare neutrality on the subject of Civil War, reasoning that the X-Men sympathized too much with Captain America&#x27;s side – who, like the X-Men, were persecuted for wanting to do the right thing – but believed that the mutant race had suffered too great a loss recently to take a side either way due to the recent depowering of so many mutants. Bishop leaves the team to join the Registration supporters and locate the escaped 198. In &quot;Civil War: X-Men&quot; #2, Cyclops under mind control of Johnny Dee helps the futuristic X-Man in recovering them. Cyclops is then manipulated into attacking Bishop which he does by overloading Bishop&#x27;s power of energy absorption.

=== World War Hulk ===

Cyclops is listed at IGN as a target on Hulk&#x27;s &quot;Hit List&quot; of characters. He is seen fighting the Hulk in &quot;World War Hulk: X-Men&quot; #1 and in issue #2, he uses a full beam blast to stop the Hulk, refusing to let the Hulk take Professor Xavier regardless of his own feelings towards his mentor regarding the truth about Krakoa. While it peels off some of the Hulk&#x27;s skin, he was able to walk towards Cyclops and clench his entire face, effectively containing the blast. After Hulk left when Mercury told him about the mutant race being near-extinct, Cyclops began to forgive Professor X while the wounded were being tended to.

=== Messiah Complex ===

Cyclops leads a team to Alaska to find the new mutant detected by Cerebro. When the team arrives, they find nearly every child in the town killed, dead Marauders and Purifiers, and the baby gone. He sends a team consisting of Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Angel, and Colossus to find former Acolytes for information on the Marauders. He argues with Xavier, who complains about not telling him about his team. Scott tells Xavier they are not his X-Men any more and that he can do what he wants. Scott also calls in X-Factor to help with the situation, asks Rictor to infiltrate the Purifiers, and asks Madrox and Layla Miller to go see Forge. Upon discovering that Cable has kidnapped the newborn mutant, Cyclops orders the reforming of X-Force with Wolverine leading the team. Their first mission is to hunt down Cable and retrieve the baby. Cyclops later breaks all ties with Professor X and asks him to leave the mansion, as Xavier continues to question Cyclops&#x27;s judgement. Later on, Cyclops is seen with his own team and X-Factor, to help out Wolverine against the Reavers and to capture the baby from Cable. Cable eludes the X-Men.

After finding the Marauders&#x27; hideout on Muir Island, Cyclops dispatches X-Force and Bishop to go there and retrieve the baby. During the final battle, Cyclops sends the New X-Men against the Marauders, believing that Sinister&#x27;s forces will be caught off guard by unfamiliar opponents. The students prove to be effective. Cyclops then confronts Cable demanding the baby. Cable, with a gun pointed at his father, begs Cyclops to let him escape into the future with the baby. However, Cable gives the child to Cyclops, after Xavier points out that the future of all mutantkind is at stake and Cyclops, as leader of the X-Men, speaks for mutantkind. Cyclops holds the baby and, realizing that the child deserves the chance to make its own destiny, gives her back to Cable. Cable teleports to the future just as Bishop fires a round at the child. The shot misses her and hits Xavier in the head. Cyclops strikes Bishop with an optic blast, and Cyclops declares the X-Men disbanded.

=== Manifest Destiny ===
During the interim period, Cyclops goes on a vacation with Emma to the Savage Land after refusing Tony Stark&#x27;s request to have the X-Men as part of the Fifty State Initiative. There, they are contacted by Warren asking them for assistance in San Francisco. Scott and Emma are successful in rescuing not only Warren and the other X-Men, but also in rescuing San Francisco as a whole. As a result, the Mayor of the city offers to help the X-Men reestablish themselves in the city. After building a new headquarters, Cyclops sends word to all the world&#x27;s mutants that San Francisco, which has welcomed the X-Men with open-arms, is now a safe haven for mutant-kind and that all are welcomed to join them. The X-Men&#x27;s presence is widely approved of by San Francisco, including the police, who now hire the team to aid them in cases that might be out of their area.

Cyclops dispatches Wolverine to track down Mystique and revives X-Force as a clandestine black-ops team whose mission is to take down threats to mutantkind that they cannot deal with while under the public eye. Cyclops places Wolverine in charge of the team and resolutely keeps X-Force&#x27;s existence secret from the other X-Men, including Emma Frost (manifested as a psychic &quot;black box&quot; in his mind that Emma is unable to open), also demanding that X-Force remain unknown to the public. However, Cyclops utilizes other X-Men for parts of the groups mission, including Beast and the Stepford Cuckoos. The team is sometimes less careful, leaving blood-stained clothing around, piquing Emma&#x27;s suspicions. The controversy of Cyclops&#x27;s decisions as leader of the X-Men is further highlighted during the Skrull invasion of San Francisco when he readily utilizes biological warfare against the Skrulls by knowingly infecting them with an adapted version of the Mutant Legacy Virus created by Beast without first determining if there was also a cure.

In another controversial decision, Cyclops sends X-Force to track down the Leper Queen who is infecting mutants with a strain of the Legacy Virus to use their uncontrolled powers in attacks against humanity in order to stir up anti-mutant hysteria. While on the mission, Beast locates Cable in the future and Cyclops orders X-Force to abandon the current mission and prepare for transport to the future to assist Cable and the baby, Hope. Despite knowing that the Leper Queen has kidnapped and intends to kill Hellion, Surge, and Boom Boom, regardless of the protests from both X-Force and Beast that a few more minutes is all that is needed to kill her and save the students, Cyclops makes the difficult decision to activate the time machine. Though Domino is only moments away from killing the Leper Queen, the team is transported to the future and the Leper Queen appears to shoot Boom Boom in the head, while Hellion and Surge are injected and sent to the United Nations building for another attack. Upon his return to the present Wolverine confronts Cyclops on the risks he took in making that decision.

=== Anti-mutant rioting and the return of Madelyne Pryor ===
Footage of Cooperstown, Alaska from &quot;X-Men: Messiah Complex&quot; is eventually released to the media by Simon Trask, designed to deceive the public into believing that the destruction was caused by the newborn mutant messiah rather than the Purifiers. The footage, coupled with Trask&#x27;s newly formed &quot;Humanity Now! Coalition&quot; pushing anti-mutant legislation, dubbed &quot;Proposition X&quot;, aiming to control mutant reproduction, causes an increase in mutant hate crimes, causing Scott to open the X-Men&#x27;s base to anyone seeking refuge. During this time, his growing secrecy concerning X-Force and Emma&#x27;s suspicions that he is keeping something from her begin creating a rift between them. Taking advice from Storm that Scott&#x27;s actions are always in the best interest of mutant-kind, Emma secretly agrees to participate in Norman Osborn&#x27;s Cabal in her own attempt to ensure the protection of the mutant population.

Scott encounters his dead ex-wife, Madelyne Pryor, again when she inexplicably returns as a psychic ghost, calling herself the Red Queen and with a newly assembled all-female team of mutants calling themselves the &quot;Sisterhood&quot;. Her team attacks the X-Men and Madelyne steals a lock of Jean&#x27;s hair in Wolverine&#x27;s possession, with the goal of using it to locate and inhabit Jean&#x27;s body, allowing her to be reborn. Scott employs Domino to exhume Jean&#x27;s grave and swap her body with another. Unaware of the switch and spurning Scott&#x27;s attempt to reach out to her, Madelyne attempts to possess the body, but seemingly disintegrates into nothingness as no other body than Jean Grey&#x27;s can house an entity of Madelyne&#x27;s level of power.

=== Utopia/Dark Reign/Siege ===
After the battle with Madelyne and the Sisterhood, Beast confronts Scott and Emma, stating that he is aware of both of their clandestine actions and that they will discuss them at length together or their secrets will tear the X-Men apart. In the limited crossover tie-in, &quot;Dark X-Men/Dark Avengers: Utopia&quot;, the growing unrest among the mutant population and calculated instigation from Trask and Humanity Now! leads to violent rioting from mutants against the anti-mutant coalition in San Francisco. Though supported by the mayor, Cyclops is largely viewed as the leader of the remaining mutant population by the media and he takes the brunt of negative media and public opinion, implicated as endorsing and sending the X-Men to lead the rioting. Trask capitalizes on the hysteria, portraying Humanity Now! as victims of oppression in order to push Proposition X. Norman Osborn utilizes the Dark Avengers to stop the riots and arrest Cyclops and his team of X-Men, calling in Emma to lead a new team of &quot;Dark&quot; X-Men. Emma agrees to lead the team, which will answer to Osborn, as the Black Queen. Marvel writer Matt Fraction indicated that Emma&#x27;s alliance with Osborn places Scott and Emma at odds with one another, creating &quot;a profound schism&quot;. Cyclops travels to Osborn&#x27;s base on Alcatraz Island to speak with him. Osborn tells Cyclops that they can end the riots and hysteria here right now but Cyclops interrupts him and orders him to surrender. A shocked Osborn asks what he means, and Cyclops replies that Osborn needs to get the riots under control and then withdraw H.A.M.M.E.R. and the Dark Avengers and leave San Francisco to him and the X-Men. When Osborn refuses Cyclops leaves, telling Osborn that he tried. After Cyclops leaves, Osborn tells Victoria Hand that when the time comes Osborn is going to kill Cyclops personally.

As Emma&#x27;s Dark X-Men slowly get the city under control, Cyclops continues to form his plans to deal with the situation. Scott assigns his X-Men (such as Mirage, Domino, Mindee Cuckoo, and Psylocke) different tasks, as well as having another team observe Emma&#x27;s team, as they deal with a group of bio-sentinels attacking San Francisco. When asked how they are expected to take out both the Dark X-Men &quot;and&quot; Dark Avengers, Scott retorts &quot;Who said you&#x27;re the squad that&#x27;s supposed to stop the Avengers?&quot;

Scott&#x27;s plan finally comes together as he has Magik teleport X-Force into H.A.M.M.E.R&#x27;s Alcatraz Island, where they take on the Dark X-Men and Avengers, while Magik teleports all the captured mutants to safety. X-Force is aided by Emma and Namor, who are revealed to be double-agents against Osborn. Immediately after, Scott has the X-Club resurrect Asteroid M which crashed into the Pacific Coast a few years prior. Cyclops then orders Magik and Pixie to teleport every X-Man and allied mutant to what he now calls &#x27;Utopia&#x27;. During a press conference, Cyclops informs the world that they have left the United States and that they reject Norman Osborn and his methods.

During this time period, Cyclops struggles to define what he wants Utopia to be (nation/base/etc.) Utopia is attacked by numerous threats, including the events of &quot;Necrosha&quot;, &quot;Infernus 2&quot;, and &quot;Fear Itself&quot;. After the discovery of X-Force, Beast leaves Utopia and blames Cyclops for terrible judgement in how he is running Utopia.

When Osborn&#x27;s illegal siege on Asgard is about to end sooner by the hands of the real Avengers led by the revived original Captain America, Cyclops is one of the non-participating heroes who watches Osborn&#x27;s downfall live. He is seen watching the said siege alongside Wolverine inside the base at Utopia.

=== Second Coming and Age of Heroes ===
Sometime after Utopia began, Cable returns to present day Westchester, New York with Hope Summers, the baby believed to be the mutant Messiah. As Cable had no idea that Cyclops and the X-Men moved to Utopia, Cyclops deploys his senior team of X-Men to search and rescue just as the purifiers and Nimrod begin their attack on Cable and Hope. During the rescue, Nightcrawler is killed teleporting Hope back to Utopia. Cyclops holds a funeral for his fallen friend (one of the few who really believed in Scott&#x27;s belief of the mutant messiah). Beast arrives on Utopia for the funeral and blames Cyclops for the loss of Nightcrawler. Shortly after, an impenetrable field surrounds Utopia and sentinels from the future begin to attack. Cyclops is forced to send a team of X-Men into the future led by Cable, but upon their return Cyclops and Hope watch Cable die from a combination of the techno virus and time travel. After Nimrod and the purifiers are defeated, Cyclops holds a funeral for his fallen son. As Emma Frost witnesses a sign of the Phoenix manifesting in Hope, she runs to tell Scott who dismisses her as he sees he was right all along: Cerebra detected 5 brand new mutant signals. Cyclops deploys Hope to recruit the new mutant signals and they become her team known as &quot;The Lights&quot;. Shortly after, Cyclops is awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on the request of Commander Steve Rogers for his acts, but subsequently discards it as he wants to focus on doing what is right for the people rather than worrying about how his actions are perceived by others.

=== Fear Itself ===
A possessed Juggernaut escapes Thunderbolts captivity and begins to make his way west to San Francisco to either destroy Utopia or destroy San Francisco, depending on which side would give up the other first. Cyclops deploys multiple attempts to stop the Norse-powered Juggernaut to no avail. As one of his final plans, Cyclops sends Magik, Colossus, and Shadowcat to meet with Cyttorak to convince him to take away the powers he gave Juggernaut. Cyttorak agrees in exchange for making Colossus the new Juggernaut avatar and is able to push Cain Marko back until Cain is summoned by The Serpent.

=== Schism ===
At the beginning of Schism, Cyclops thanks Wolverine for always being there for him as they have finally achieved mutual respect after years of fighting and rivalry. While at a conference for weapon control, Kid Omega (Quentin Quire) launches a psychic terrorist attack on the ambassadors present. In response, sentinels are deployed at the conference and are disposed of by Cyclops and Wolverine. Due to growing fears of mutant threat, countries around the world begin to mobilize their Sentinel forces. Cyclops begins to deploy X-Men around the globe to deal with the threat. Sometime after, Kid Omega shows up on Utopia to plead for amnesty. Wolverine tries to attack Kid Omega when Cyclops stops him. When Kid Omega insults Wolverine, Cyclops defends Wolverine and commands Quentin to be quiet. Later, Cyclops sends a team to a local mutant museum exhibit as a &quot;show of force&quot;. The new Hellfire Club attacks the exhibit and incapacitates all senior X-Men present. As Cyclops flies to the museum from Utopia and Wolverine rushes to help, Idie asks if she should kill the Hellfire Club to help. While Wolverine protests against it profusely, Cyclops tells Idie to do what she feels is right. Idie kills almost every Hellfire Club member left to save her friends and mentors. Wolverine pops his claws at Cyclops in anger but restrains himself when he realizes what he is doing.

However, the new Hellfire Club activates a special giant Sentinel, sent towards Utopia. With most of the X-Men far from Utopia and part of the team being in the med-lab, young mutant messiah Hope Summers and other teenage mutants volunteer to join Cyclops in the fight against the super Sentinel. Wolverine is opposed to the idea of putting children on the front lines against the Sentinel; when Cyclops insists that everyone who wants to fight should fight, Wolverine gets a detonator and threatens to blow up Utopia in order to make the youngsters run away from the island and destroy the super Sentinel. Cyclops and Wolverine&#x27;s frustration with each other come to a head when Cyclops brings up Jean Grey. The two fight each other in a rage while being attacked by the sentinel.

Eventually, the super Sentinel threat forces them to stop fighting each other and join Hope and the other young mutants in the battle against the Sentinel, and the Sentinel is finally taken down. But the ideological differences between Cyclops and Wolverine makes Wolverine decide to leave Utopia and bring along whoever wants to come with him. Both men eventually start recruiting their teammates; some members of the X-Men leave with Wolverine, while part of the team stays in Utopia with Cyclops.

=== X-Men: Regenesis ===
While Wolverine does not leave as an enemy of Cyclops and his X-Men, he makes clear he wants both sides to stay out of the other&#x27;s business. Various X-Men leave for various reasons; Rogue, for example, departs because she feels that Cyclops has lost perspective and cannot accept the possibility of being wrong. With the X-Men who have chosen to leave alongside him, Wolverine returns to Westchester, New York to open the Jean Grey School for the Gifted while Cyclops organizes new teams of X-Men and remains on Utopia.

=== Avengers vs. X-Men ===
With the discovery that the Phoenix Force is returning to Earth, apparently to use Hope as a host, Cyclops believes Hope as Phoenix can be used to &#x27;jump-start&#x27; the mutant population. Captain America, fearing that the Phoenix will come to Earth and destroy everything, assembles a force of Avengers aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier and using the S.H.I.E.L.D. cloaking technology travels to Utopia to confront Cyclops. Upon arriving on Utopia, Captain America orders Cyclops to transfer Hope to his protective custody. Assuming that Captain America will not take no for answer Cyclops refuses and uses his optic blast to push the Captain back into the sea. Captain America then orders the Avengers take the beach and apprehend the mutant, Hope. Cyclops denounces the Avengers as having always seen the mutants as &#x27;ugly stepchildren&#x27; and will now seek to actively undermine them after they acquired a &quot;messiah&quot;. During battle, Hope escapes Utopia. After Hope escapes, Cyclops orders the X-Men to surrender and ends the fighting. Once Magik returns to Utopia, Cyclops directs Magik to use her teleportation power to facilitate the X-Men&#x27;s escape.

Cyclops scatters the X-Men across the globe with the mission to prevent the Avengers from capturing Hope. Hope seeks out Wolverine for help. Wolverine aids Hope in traveling to the Blue Area of the Moon but then calls the Avengers to inform them of Hope&#x27;s location. Cyclops and a select group of X-Men arrive to stop Hope&#x27;s capture. Iron Man fails in his attempt to disrupt the Phoenix Force. As a result, the Phoenix Force is divided and instead inhabits five X-Men present on the moon none of which is Hope. Cyclops, one of the new Phoenix avatars, travels back to Earth with an unconscious Hope. The newly dubbed Phoenix Five begin to transform the world. The world&#x27;s transformation beings as a utopian society which descends to a police state as the avatars are corrupted by the power of the Phoenix and are unable to control their desires, impulses, fantasies and whims from changing reality. Wanda teleports Hope away and Cyclops declares that there will be no more Avengers.

In defense against the combined assault of the Avengers and the X-Men, Cyclops attacks Emma Frost and absorbs her portion of the Phoenix Force, before killing Xavier and transforming into Dark Phoenix. In pitched battle, the Avengers and X-Men weaken Cyclops enough for Hope to absorb the Phoenix Force into herself. She undoes the changes to the world caused by Cyclops and she and the Scarlet Witch then spread out the Phoenix Force across the globe, causing thousands of people to become mutants. Cyclops is held captive in a ruby quartz cell and while guilt-stricken over killing Xavier, he is happy over the mutant race restarted and claims he would do it all over again.

Captain America convinces Wolverine to visit Cyclops, who is being held in a specialized private prison created for the reemerged mutant population, to learn where his Extinction Team might be hiding. Cyclops baits Wolverine into trying to kill him, but Wolverine lets up once he realizes that Cyclops wants to die and be made a martyr. Once returned to general population, Cyclops is joined by Jake, the only other mutant inmate in the prison. The pair soon realize that all the guards have left as three inmates approach them brandishing shivs. When the inmates move towards Jake, Cyclops tells the inmates to leave him out of this. The tattooed inmate states to Cyclops that their issue is with all mutants as he and the other two inmates attack them. However, due to his training in martial arts, Cyclops was able to defeat the three inmates. After that, he had a talk with Jake who revealed his origin to Cyclops. Cyclops then tells Jake about the Jean Grey School and they might take older students. Later that night, Cyclops uses metal filings to communicate with Magneto and tell him not to break him out as he must stay a prisoner, a political prisoner and he will not let them turn him into a criminal.

Cyclops allows Iron Man to study him for remaining effects of the Phoenix Force. As he is leaving, Jake is murdered by the mutant-hating inmates. Depressed at this action, Cyclops ends up taking up the earlier offer from Magneto to break him out of prison. Magneto, Magik, and Danger break Cyclops out of prison. Before leaving with Magneto, Magik, and Danger, Cyclops has Magik send Jake&#x27;s murderers to Limbo and has Danger disfigure the corrupt warden by carving an X on his face. The Avengers arrive to find the prison demolished and abandoned except for the warden who delivers a message from Cyclops to Wolverine stating that he will support Wolverine&#x27;s school and continue to fight for mutant rights, noting that now that Wolverine has taken the role of &quot;the better man&quot;, Cyclops can be &quot;the man who does what&#x27;s necessary&quot;. Cyclops, Magneto and Magik watch a newscaster advocating putting mutants in concentration camps. When Magneto asks Cyclops if killing Neanderthal newsmen falls within their purview, Cyclops tells him it does not. Magneto warns him that they are embarking on something completely different now, but Cyclops tells him that he is wrong saying that just like before, they are hated, feared, and saving the world.

=== Post-Avengers vs. X-Men ===

With the X-Men disturbed at Scott&#x27;s more violent policies — including attacking police officers and various officials for illegally detaining mutants after their powers manifested — but unwilling to actively confront him for fear of triggering a mutant civil war, a chance comment by Iceman inspires Beast to pursue a new solution; he travels back in time to recruit the Scott Summers from the early days of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters to convince the present Scott that what he was doing was wrong. It is also speculated that those who either possessed or had strong interactions with the Phoenix Force have had their abilities altered in varying ways. This leaves the present day Cyclops with little to no control over his powers.

It is also revealed that the &quot;Mutant Revolution&quot; and Cyclops in particular have gained popular support among the general public, despite continued distrust and animosity from the Avengers and X-Men.

Later it was revealed that the reason for this alteration was not from the exposure to the Phoenix Force but because they had been infected by Dark Beast with nano-sentinels. Once they removed the nano-sentinels from their bodies, they regained total control over their powers.

=== New Xavier School ===
Cyclops has made a new base in the old Weapon X facility in Canada to train new mutants with Emma Frost, Magik and Magneto. He calls it New Xavier School for the Gifted. It was revealed that Scott, Emma, Illyana and Magneto had been infected with nanite sentinels that had corrupted their powers and caused them to be unpredictable. Cyclops then begins recruiting new mutants for his new Uncanny X-Men. He uses Cerebro to find new mutants and often clashes with Sentinels, S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers, and even mutants from the future during the Battle of the Atom.

Storm finds Cyclops&#x27;s new school in order to tell him that Xavier&#x27;s last will and testament will be read in Westchester and they will allow him back on the original school&#x27;s campus again. After the reading of Xavier&#x27;s will, in which he left everything to the present Scott and noted that he always saw Scott as a son, Scott decided to close the New Xavier School and send all his students to the Jean Grey School, reflecting that he had simply started making threats after all other methods had failed but was now forced to recognize that such an action was not what Xavier would have wanted of him, admitting that he had never had a real plan for what would happen if someone tried to make him enforce those threats.

Cyclops, after finally realizing what his mutant revolution is, gathered mutants at the White House to show humans that the mutants could all gather in one place without creating harm to the human race. Some X-Men were reluctant to appreciate Cyclops&#x27;s act, while other endorsed him, such as Nightcrawler, his brother Havok, and finally Magneto, who stated that, even if Cyclops&#x27;s actions seemed insane, Xavier would have loved this.

=== &quot;Secret Wars&quot; ===
At some point during the future &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline, Cyclops acquires a Phoenix Egg which he holds in reserve, hoping to use it to end the Incursions.

During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Cyclops stands on top of the Phoenix Egg during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. Cyclops eventually uses the Phoenix Egg to become one with the Phoenix Force again and uses his powers to decimate the Children of Tomorrow, before joining most of the surviving heroes from his universe in their &#x27;life raft&#x27;, his fellow survivors including Mister Fantastic, Carol Danvers (now known as Captain Marvel), Spider-Man, Black Panther, the new Thor, and Star-Lord. They remain in stasis for a time until they are released by Doctor Strange- who survived the incursions on his own- and meet Miles Morales, the successor to the Ultimate universe&#x27;s original Spider-Man. Learning that Strange is now Doctor Doom&#x27;s sheriff, the heroes set out to learn more about where they are now and what&#x27;s the situation in the present world. Although Cyclops&#x27;s Phoenix-influenced state initially accepts the new world that Doom has created following the destruction of the Multiverse, he joins the other survivors in attacking Doctor Doom. The Phoenix Force actually allows Cyclops to hold his own for a time against Doom&#x27;s Beyonder-acquired powers, but the fight ends with Doom breaking Cyclops&#x27;s neck.

=== All-New, All-Different ===
Following &quot;Secret Wars&quot; and the restoration of Earth-616, Cyclops was killed during &quot;Death of X&quot;, when the X-Men discovered that the released Terrigen mists were fatal to mutants upon exposure. Cyclops was one of the first victims of the M-Pox, although Emma Frost used a telepathic projection of him to rally mutant attempts to destroy a Terrigenesis cloud, subsequently faking his death in a final confrontation with Black Bolt to create a détente between mutants and Inhumans so that the two could work on saving mutants while leaving each other alone. Only the Stepford Cuckoos, Havok, and Magneto were aware of Emma&#x27;s deception (and Magneto aware only because his helmet prevented Emma from altering his mind).

Although the specific details of his death were not known to the public, eight months later, several mutant youths regarded Cyclops as a figure of inspiration for standing up for their rights. This led to problems for the young Cyclops, who is disgusted at what his future self has become and resents the legacy he is seemingly destined to leave. He travels the country hunting down a team of villains calling themselves &quot;The Ghosts of Cyclops&quot; who claim to be fighting for mutant rights, but are really using their powers to steal. It turns out they are just college students and the All-New X-Men come to save them. Cyclops convinces them to turn themselves in rather than fight the police. He vows to not go down the same destructive path as older Cyclops. Storm in particular is recorded as blaming the elder Cyclops for spreading the M-Pox.

With the disappearance of Colossus and Magik at the hands of the Marauders, the X-Men confronted Mr. Sinister only to discover that he was experimenting on unwilling subjects to try to make Inhuman and Mutant DNA co-exist in order to create a genetically superior species of mutants who could survive the Terrigen Mist. To their surprise, Sinister deployed his only successful specimen, the seemingly-revived Cyclops. This Cyclops, however, was soon revealed to be an experiment created by Sinister who combined Scott Summers&#x27; genetic material with Inhuman DNA.

When the Phoenix attempts to return once again by resurrecting the adult Jean Grey, it allows her to talk with what appears to be Cyclops&#x27; spirit. But after reading his mind about the events that led to his death, Jean simply expresses regret that she was not there to help him and the former lovers apologize to each other for the way things ended before agreeing that they should remain dead. &#x27;Scott&#x27; subsequently ages rapidly and dies in Jean&#x27;s arms, whereupon Jean informs the Phoenix that all she wanted was to say goodbye to her husband.

=== Extermination ===
The entire X-Men team find themselves hunted on two fronts with one group being the mutant-hunter known as Ahab from a dark possible future where he has turned various mutants into his &#x27;hounds&#x27; to hunt their fellows, and another being a younger version of Cable, who is so determined to send the young X-Men back to their own time that he actually kills his own future self to stop him interfering, as well as performing &#x27;surgery&#x27; to restore Warren&#x27;s original feathered wings. After Mimic is killed when he acts as a decoy to save young Cyclops, the original five accept the need to return home, but only after taking a detour into the future to meet the younger versions of Ahab&#x27;s key mutant soldiers, allowing Jean to learn how their powers work. With this new knowledge, Jean is able to program a &#x27;time delay&#x27; on the original five&#x27;s memories once they return to the past, erasing all knowledge of events in the future until they reach that point, simultaneously granting the present Jean with knowledge of how to stop the Hounds. The timeline is thus restored to its original course, with Jean, Hank, Warren and Bobby meeting for milkshakes to talk about their new memories, unaware that young-Cable is talking with a now-alive adult Cyclops.

=== X-Men Disassembled ===
After most of the X-Men who participated the battle, including Legion, Magneto, Apocalypse, Blob and Omega Red are vanished by the hands of X-Man, who plans to reshape the world without X-Men, Cyclops, while keeping his low profile, is seen a few days later reading news of the X-Men&#x27;s disappearance.

It is explained that his recent resurrection was caused when the younger version of Cable went to find Paul, a human who was rescued by Cyclops from giant robots controlled by the vengeful professor Mavin, back during the original X-Men era, with Paul now working for Tony Stark as a scientist. Cable gives Paul the Phoenix Cage device created by the Avengers back in 2012 to recreate the device so he could resurrect Cyclops. Cable and Paul manage to find Cyclops&#x27;s corpse after his public &#x27;death&#x27;, and implanted a smaller version of the Phoenix Cage into the corpse&#x27;s heart. When Cyclops was temporarily brought back by the Phoenix during Jean&#x27;s resurrection, the Phoenix Cage is activated and absorbs a small portion of Phoenix Force which eventually restored Cyclops to full life even after the Phoenix abandoned him. After the time-displaced X-Men manage to return to their time, Cyclops gains the extra memories of his past-self, while finding out that the original older Cable had been screwing the timeline for keeping the younger X-Men in the present. Although Cable admits that he brought his father back to life primarily because he saw his death as unfair, he keeps Cyclops contained in his base until the other X-Men are engaged in battle against Nate Grey at the same moment as Professor Marvin escapes prison and goes after Paul for revenge, Cable then forcing Cyclops to choose which of the two he will save. Although the other X-Men are apparently killed by Nate, Cyclops&#x27; decision to save Paul allows him to reassess his actions prior to his death and conclude that he had become as bad as his enemies, choosing to help mutants over humans regardless of the consequences. Visiting Utopia, the place where he killed Professor X during the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; event and also where Nate vanishes the participating X-Men, Cyclops vows to find the lost X-Men and restore them to create a brighter future, joined by the resurrected Wolverine, but unable to save Blindfold from committing her own suicide attempts. After defending themselves from Purifiers, Sapien League and Reavers&#x27; attacks, Cyclops and Wolverine went to rescue and recruit Magik, Wolfsbane, Karma, Strong Guy and one of Multiple Man&#x27;s duplicate from O*N*E compound, including Cyclops’ brother Havok, who turned himself in due to having his crime status when he was affected by an inverse effect back in &quot;AXIS&quot; event until he got freed during the near end of &quot;Secret Empire&quot;. However, they are unable to save Strong Guy and one of Multiple Man&#x27;s duplicate, due to the former sacrificing his life to save the surviving new X-Men team from the virus bomb implanted on the said duplicate by O*N*E.

During War of the Realms event Cyclops joins forces with his time displaced younger self&#x27;s allies Champions to take down Malekith&#x27;s forces. Eventually, the other X-Men returns from the alternate reality created by Nate Grey and he reunites with Jean Grey for the first time in many years and defeats O.N.E.

===House of X===
Scott Summers lives on the sovereign nation-state of Krakoa for mutants, created by Charles Xavier, Magneto, and Moira X. When the Fantastic Four captures Sabretooth after he kills several guards during a heist, he shows up to claim him on the grounds of amnesty, though he agrees to leave Sabretooth behind after Mr. Fantastic refuses. He also asks the Fantastic Four to let Franklin Richards know there is a place for him in Krakoa. Later on, Cyclops leads a team of X-Men to destroy Mother Mold and prevent the creation of Nimrod. Though they succeed, they are all killed during the mission. However, the entire team is resurrected by a group of mutants known as the Five (Goldballs, Tempus, Proteus, Elixir, Hope Summers) and are proclaimed the heroes of Krakoa.

Cyclops would later assume the alias of Captain Krakoa to keep the Xavier Resurrection Protocols a secret from the world.

===Outlawed===
Upon learning many pre-adult superheroes have been falsely outlawed by the crusade of Roxxon, through manipulating Senator Geoffrey Patrick and C.R.A.D.L.E., Cyclops, Pixie and Dust rushes to help the surviving Champions and clear Kamala&#x27;s name from being used for an unjust law. While in Iron Heart&#x27;s hidden lab, Cyclops inform that Viv Vision is alive, and selling out both of her own teammates and fellow teenage superheroes to the C.R.A.D.L.E.. He tricked C.R.A.D.L.E. into believing the Champions are escorted to Krakoa, and tries his best to find a safer place that is not at Krakoa for them, due to the island restriction. He enlist Bishop, Iceman, Pyro, Shadowcat and Storm to provide the Champions the X-Men&#x27;s personal pirate ship to live far away from U.S.A.

==Powers and abilities==
Cyclops emits powerful beams of energy from his eyes, described as &quot;optic blasts&quot;, which have the appearance of red light and deliver massive concussive force. His cells constantly absorb solar energy and he can use some of that energy to create an opening to another universe in front of his eyes. The beams fire from these openings. The beams cause no recoil or heat, are tremendously powerful, and can be used to rupture steel plates and pulverize rock, or even punch a hole through a mountain. The beams constantly emanate from his eyes involuntarily, and can generally only be stopped by his own eyelids, or by shielding his eyes with &quot;ruby-quartz&quot;, a translucent mineral. Cyclops wears ruby-quartz as lenses in his sunglasses or in his visor, which is generally the only way for him to safely see without inadvertently damaging his surroundings. The beams&#x27; involuntary nature has been explained as a psychological shortcoming that resulted from childhood trauma. Cyclops can nevertheless manipulate the beams in several different ways, partially through the use of adjustable apertures in his visor that allow the beams to fire through their shielding at variable levels.

In addition to varying the beam width, height, and intensity, Cyclops has demonstrated a high degree of skill and accuracy in manipulating his optic blast. Cyclops is able to reflect the beam off hard and shiny surfaces. This feat also demonstrates his intuitive sense of spatial geometry between objects. The reflective qualities of the beams allows him to bounce the beam off many different surfaces in rapid succession. It has been observed to be focused tight enough to punch a pinhole through a coin, drill through the trunk of a log, and pierce the skin of the Blob. Cyclops has shown the power of his optic blast by blasting through the walls of a hardened building, tunneling through solid rock, and blowing the top off a mountain. Cyclops&#x27;s force beams were measured by Iron Man to be almost 2 gigawatts. Two gigawatts is about half the peak power output of the Doel Nuclear Power Plant and when Cyclops released this much energy he exceeded his control over his optic beam. With Cyclops unable to shut off his optic beam, Leech came to his aid and negated his mutant power. Against other Marvel characters, Cyclops has been able to use his optic beam to knock Thor&#x27;s Hammer from his hand. He is known to be able to overload Bishop&#x27;s energy absorption power and is revealed to never have willingly used more than a small fraction of his full potential due to his anxiety regarding his optic blast.

Early accounts describe Cyclops&#x27; optic beams as the product of his body metabolizing sunlight and other ambient energy. This is similar to his brother Alex (alias Havok) who metabolizes cosmic radiation. This metabolized energy is then released in the form of the beam from his eyes. In some stories, Cyclops depletes his body&#x27;s energy reserves and needs to recharge through exposure to sunlight. When depleted, Cyclops continued to emit the beams; however, their intensity was greatly diminished. One story showed him able to safely open his eyes when in total darkness-without any ambient light to absorb, his power diminished to the point that he did not need his visor.

The original 1983 &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; volume stated that Cyclops&#x27; eyes contain inter-dimensional apertures, releasing powerful energies from another dimension into his own via the beams. This account states that his body naturally metabolizes ambient energy that is used to open and focus the apertures in his eyes. The energy of the beam itself originates from this other dimension. This explanation, however, was later changed for the 1986 &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition&quot;.

Cyclops&#x27;s body is naturally immune to the force of his own beams. His mind projects a psionic field that envelops his body rendering it immune to his optic beam, allowing him to shut it off by simply closing his eyes. Scott is also immune to the power of his brother Alex (Havok) who has the ability to emit waves of energy that heat the air into plasma. Likewise, Havok has demonstrated immunity to Cyclops&#x27;s optic beam. Scott has been shown as being able to absorb Storm&#x27;s lightning bolt, although this act caused Cyclops a great deal of pain. The ruby quartz used in his battle visor has been said to resonate with his body&#x27;s psionic field. Scott has only limited resistance to his brother Vulcan&#x27;s powers.

In his X-Men uniform, he uses a ruby quartz battle visor in place of the glasses. His uniform has firing studs incorporated into his gloves and on the sides of the battle visor that control the visor&#x27;s aperture. In the event that the visor has a power failure, the apertures are spring-loaded to automatically close so Cyclops can at least see normally. He has also been observed using casual sunglasses and contact lenses made from the same ruby quartz as his visor lens.

Cyclops&#x27; poor control over his power is attributed to events in his childhood, initially described as being due to a head wound, disabling his brain&#x27;s ability to turn off his optic blasts. Later depictions explained that his lack of control is psychosomatic and due to the emotionally traumatic events of his childhood. This later explanation allowed Cyclops to finally control his optic blasts for a short time during a mission on the Breakworld, though at the conclusion of these events, he revealed that he was beginning to lose control again and reverted to using his visor and lenses.

Cyclops&#x27; power has been altered by his exposure to the Phoenix Force. His optic blasts are more powerful, now appearing as multiple curved beams. His optic blasts can even cause Dormammu pain. However he would afterward be infected with nano-sentinels that made him lose control over his power even further, to the point that his blasts became inaccurate, activating on their own and becoming even more unstable. The end of the issue concludes with Beast purging the nano-sentinels from both Cyclops and Magik, giving him control over his still altered optic blasts.

===Skills===
Cyclops seems to possess an uncanny sense of geometry, in this sense used to describe his observation of objects around himself and the angles found between surfaces of these objects. Cyclops has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to cause his optic blasts to ricochet and/or reflect off those objects in a trajectory to his liking. This is commonly called a &quot;banked shot&quot; when applied to this talent. Cyclops has been observed causing beams to reflect from over a dozen surfaces in the course of one blast, and still hit his intended target accurately. It is his sense of superhumanly enhanced spatial awareness that allows him to perform these feats as well. On two occasions Cyclops has been fast enough to blindly predict the position of Quicksilver and Northstar who were moving at superhuman speeds with enough accuracy to hit them with his optic blast. Cyclops is an expert pilot of fixed-wing aircraft, a skill he appears to have inherited from his father. It has also been implied that his geometric sense improves his abilities in the air. Cyclops has spent most of his superhero career as the leader of either the X-Men or X-Factor and has developed exceptional leadership skills. According to Nick Fury&#x27;s files, Scott&#x27;s abilities are at their best during tense situations. Fury notes that the less time Cyclops has to think about a decision, the better that decision is. Even when vacationing in the Savage Land, while others enjoy watching two dinosaurs fight, Scott analyzes their strength and calculates how to defeat them by himself. Even Sebastian Shaw has acknowledged Cyclops&#x27;s skill in taking advantage of the single flaw in the Hellfire Club&#x27;s defense to reverse a dire situation for the X-Men. When the other X-Men were hypnotized into thinking Cyclops was the Dark Phoenix and started hunting him down, he thwarted Colossus, Nightcrawler, and Storm in quick succession before fleeing to the Danger Room and creating a jungle environment in which to hide from his fellow X-Men, allowing him to outwit and defeat Shadowcat, Wolverine, Colossus, Storm, and Rogue, all while suffering from broken ribs. In &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #150, Cyclops organizes the X-Men to defeat Magneto at a time when the team is denied their mutant powers. Cyclops also has extensive training in martial arts and unarmed combat, including black belts in Judo and Hapkido. While not a telepath himself, Cyclops has trained himself in various psychic defenses after his relationships with Jean Grey and Emma Frost. As a result, when he was possessed by a fragment of the Void – the seemingly unstoppable evil side of the Sentry – Cyclops was able to use this training to seal the Void in an inescapable prison within his own mind when even Emma Frost had only been able to stop the same Void fragment by turning into her diamond form where she had no telepathic abilities.

During the &quot;Riot at Xavier&#x27;s&quot; storyline, Cyclops faces off against Quentin Quire&#x27;s Omega Gang and can be observed doing a cartwheel while firing his optic blast at Radian&#x27;s leg. In a fight with the Horseman of Apocalypse named War, Cyclops executes an acrobatic flip off a statue in the graveyard and while inverted in mid-air fires his optic blast into the mouth of the robotic mount.

===The &quot;punch dimension&quot;===
In &quot;X-Men&quot; #43, a backup story by writer Roy Thomas and artist Werner Roth explained how Cyclops&#x27;s eye beams worked: his eyes were solar batteries and, using a process not unlike photosynthesis, his body converted sunlight into the energy that would be emitted from his eyes. However, in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; #3, Cyclops&#x27;s powers were described as such:

The 1986 update to &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; changed his powers back to how it had been in 1968, but the 2004 &quot;Handbook&quot; restated they came from &quot;interdimensional apertures between this universe and another.&quot; The current official Marvel website uses this explanation for his powers. However, currently editors at Marvel don&#x27;t like to reference this.

At some point, the meme &quot;Punches! From the Punch Dimension!&quot; was used to refer to Cyclops&#x27;s eye beams and the term for the non-Einsteinian universe stuck.

The punch dimension first canonically appeared in &quot;Ultimates 2&quot; #9, written by Al Ewing, when America Chavez visited a dimension of &quot;pure, endless concussive force.&quot; In &quot;Scarlet Witch &amp; Quicksilver&quot; #1, written by Steve Orlando, a &quot;peek into a concussive-force dimension&quot; is mentioned as the reason why the spaceship Skypiercer was damaged.

==Relationships==
Cyclops has had multiple serious relationships and is rarely written without a romantic female relationship. Cyclops&#x27; relationships are particularly complicated because of the many retcons involved in the publication history of the Jean Grey and Madelyne Pryor characters.

In terms of publication time, Cyclops&#x27;s longest and deepest romantic relationship would be with Jean Grey, whom he would eventually marry but not before she would appear to tragically die protecting the X-Men. Grieving from this loss, Scott leaves to the Summers family reunion where he meets and starts to pursue Madelyne Pryor. Scott would become obsessed with Madelyne&#x27;s similarity to Jean. Madelyne turns out to be a clone of Jean and becomes a supervillain but not before Scott marries Madelyne and has a child with her. A romantic love triangle would later be created when Jean was reawakened from a coma and brought back to life by the Fantastic Four. These relationships would be resolved over the duration of Cyclops&#x27;s appearance in the &quot;X-Factor&quot; series. Asked whether or not Cyclops was really in love with Madelyne, &quot;X-Factor&quot; writer Louise Simonson answered, &quot;I think she was a substitute for Jean.&quot; &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; writer Chris Claremont noted that Cyclops&#x27;s love for Madelyne was genuine and intended as a means of retiring the character from the team, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s a metaphor for us all. We all grow up. We all move on.&quot;

Jean Grey and Scott finally marry in &quot;X-Men&quot; #30. Afterward, Scott seemed to have reached a happy ending. Subsequently, Scott becomes possessed by Apocalypse and the lingering effects from this would taint his relationship with Jean. This combined with Jean&#x27;s returning Phoenix powers creates stress in their romantic relationship. Confused, Scott turns to Emma Frost, who takes advantage of Scott&#x27;s emotional problems, which leads to a telepathic extramarital affair. When confronted by Jean, Scott claims that they shared &quot;only thoughts&quot; and that he had done nothing wrong; Jean, however, disagrees and demands that Emma explain herself, but Emma only jeers and insults her. Enraged, Jean unleashes the immeasurable Phoenix ability on Emma, rifling through her memories and forcing her to confront the truth about herself.

In the aftermath, Scott then leaves the X-Men for a time to understand his own conflicting feelings. He returns to tell Emma that he had made a decision between her and Jean, but Jean is killed in battle before it is revealed which woman he had picked. After Jean&#x27;s death, Scott feels disillusioned with Xavier&#x27;s dream, leaves the X-Men, and refuses Emma&#x27;s offer to reopen the school. Had the school remained closed, this outcome would have led to an apocalyptic future. To avoid it, Jean, who was resurrected in this apocalyptic future, used her Phoenix abilities to absorb this future timeline into the White Hot Room. She then mentally pushed Scott past the guilt he felt over her death and made him accept Emma&#x27;s offer of reopening the school with her.

The two have since been together, although not without problems, particularly in light of the &quot;House of M&quot; storyline in which Emma alienates herself from many people by completely reformatting the school&#x27;s workings and the events involving the Hellfire Club&#x27;s return. As of the &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; stories, their relationship seems to be back on track. The relationship begins to deteriorate again with Cyclops keeping secrets about the actions of X-Force, and Emma not telling him of her agreement to join Norman Osborn&#x27;s secret alliance known as the Cabal. However, both had their secrets revealed to each other and their romantic relationship seems to be back on track once again, apparently stronger and closer than ever.

A wedge is driven between Scott and Emma&#x27;s relationship during the war with the Avengers, with Emma and the other members of the Phoenix Five becoming more and more corrupted by the Phoenix Force while Cyclops tries to control his portion as his allies go out of control. In the end, Scott betrays Emma by attacking her and stealing her portion of the Phoenix Force. Following the end of the war with the Avengers, Scott and Emma&#x27;s relationship has ended.

The time displaced version of Cyclops was in a relationship with Jean, but she ended the relationship when discovering their future. He later began a budding relationship with X-23, prior to leaving the X-Men to join his father, leaving Jean and Laura devastated. The present-day Scott was romantically approached by the time-displaced Jean at one point but he flatly stopped her advances. The displaced Scott has confirmed that he is still in love with Jean, but is unaware of the past Jean&#x27;s location.

==Other versions==
===Time-displaced Cyclops===
====All-New X-Men====
Beast hoped that bringing the original X-Men into the present would remind Cyclops of why Xavier created the X-Men and prevent a mutant genocide. The original X-Men then decide they want to stay and become the All New X-Men. Both the time-displaced Cyclops and the adult Cyclops join forces when faced with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants from the future, who come to the present and try to force the Original X-Men back into the past. This results in the Battle of the Atom crossover. When the time-displaced Jean Grey is later kidnapped by the Shi&#x27;ar and placed on trial for the destruction done by the Phoenix Force years earlier in the 2014 crossover storyline &quot;Trial of Jean Grey&quot;, the teenage Cyclops and the All-New X-Men team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy and Starjammers, and rescue Jean from the Shi&#x27;ar homeworld. The younger Cyclops learns that his father Corsair is alive, and decides to follow him out to space and leaves the X-Men. He also secretly wants some time apart from Jean Grey, who is showing feelings toward younger Hank McCoy.

In his own spin-off series, young Cyclops enjoys spending time with the father he thought was dead. They get marooned on a hostile alien planet, hunted by dangerous bounty hunters, and are kidnapped by the villainous Space Pirate Captain Valesh Malafect. Cyclops even develops a relationship with the Captain&#x27;s daughter Vileena. They eventually meet up with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the All-New X-Men during the events of The Black Vortex. After Secret Wars ends Cyclops leads a team of young X-Men consisting of the time-displaced X-Men along with Wolverine, Oya, and Evan Sabahnur with the hopes of shaking off the legacies left for them by their older counterparts.

====Inhumans vs. X-Men====
Despite facing his future self&#x27;s reputation as the man who attempted to destroy the Inhumans with his final act, the young Cyclops nevertheless sides with the other X-Men when they go to war with the Inhumans over the creation of the Terrigenesis clouds.

However, during this fight, young Cyclops is briefly possessed by the body-jumping Inhuman Mosaic, which results in him witnessing a memory Mosaic saw when he possessed Magneto of Magneto and Emma Frost standing over the future Cyclops&#x27; body after he died of M-pox. This leads to young Cyclops realizing that his future self did not die attacking the Inhumans, prompting him to vow to go after Emma Frost for what she did to his reputation. He exposes the truth about her actions at the conclusion of the war with the Inhumans when Emma tries to continue the conflict even after Medusa destroys the Terrigenesis cloud to save the mutants at the cost of the Inhumans&#x27; future, ignoring Emma&#x27;s attempts to claim that she did what Scott would have done if he could.

====Champions====
After becoming inspired by a viral speech made by Ms Marvel, the young Cyclops decides to join the new Champions team. After misreading a situation and attacking Hulk, initially the Champions attack him and restrain him. After hearing his pitch and putting it to a vote they decide to not make the same mistakes made in the most recent Civil War and not judge him for the actions of his future self, agreeing to let him join the team. Due to his experience in leading the X-Men, many of the Champions look to him for leadership. However, a leader is never formally chosen.

====ResurXion====
After &quot;Inhumans vs. X-Men&quot; ended, the young Cyclops was determined to return to his own timeline but upon returning to the past, he is crestfallen to realize that their timeline is not the same as the Earth-616 timeline. This knowledge places Cyclops into a stupor as now the time-displaced X-Men do not know what timeline they are originally from. With the new knowledge that they are from a separate timeline entirely, Cyclops and the time-displaced X-Men leave the rest of the X-Men to find their place. After joining Magneto&#x27;s team of X-Men in Madripoor, Cyclops steps down from leadership and Marvel Girl leads the team.

===1602===
In the continuity of the miniseries &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;, Scott is known as Scotius Sumerisle. He is the leader of the original five X-Men, who are united under Carlos Javier (Professor X) and are known as &quot;witchbreed&quot; instead of mutants. His powers in Marvel 1602 are identical to his powers in normal Marvel continuity, though he wears a ruby visor instead of a ruby-quartz visor to block his optic blasts. Possessively in love with Jean Grey (who is disguised as a man under the name &quot;John Grey&quot;), he becomes jealous of her friendship with Werner (Angel).

===Age of Apocalypse===
In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Scott is a villain who fights against the X-Men. Just like in the normal timeline, Scott and his brother Alex were separated from their parents when their plane was attacked by a Shi&#x27;ar spaceship. The two would end up in an orphanage run by Sinister, though in this time line, both brothers were kept by him and raised as his foster children. Unbeknownst to them, their father Christopher Summers eventually makes his way back to Earth, only to be found by Sinister and given over to the Beast (also a villain) for medical experimentation.

Both Alpha mutants, and both holding the rank of Prelate, Scott and Alex Summers dominate the new mutant aristocracy in Apocalypse&#x27;s America. Sinister employs the brothers to operate his breeding pens, act as security, and sometimes perform as special ops unit. Scott&#x27;s ability to show emotional restraint in battle earns him Sinister&#x27;s favor over Alex, fueling a dangerous rivalry between the brothers. This rivalry worsens when the brothers reunite with their real father—Christopher Summers—but are forced to kill him.

Sinister&#x27;s preference for Scott over Alex also spills over into his genetic experimentation, as with Scott&#x27;s DNA Sinister plans to create a super-mutant strong enough to destroy Apocalypse. After capturing the X-Man Jean Grey, Sinister believes that he has found Scott&#x27;s genetic match, and uses their combined DNA to produce a child, Nate Grey.

Despite an initial belief in the doctrine of mutant superiority and even being considered by Apocalypse as a candidate for Horseman, Scott has reservations about the ethics surrounding his work, primarily in terms of excess. These concerns grow substantially once he meets and becomes enthralled with Jean Grey, a prisoner and &quot;race traitor.&quot; Though Scott plans to release her on his own time, Grey&#x27;s lover, Weapon X, breaks in and liberates her himself. Scott fights back against Weapon X, severing Weapon X&#x27;s hand, but losing an eye in the process. Jean escapes with Weapon X, who remains an enemy of Scott.

In the meantime, Scott increasingly finds himself questioning the treatment of prisoners, and secretly starts releasing them. This does not go unnoticed by his brother Alex, who still harbors hostility against him. Alex re-captures Jean in order to use her against Scott, successfully exposing his brother as a traitor. Although Jean has no love for either brother, she decides to trust Scott and they attempt to escape together. Along the way the two meet Nate Grey, their genetically engineered son, though they remain oblivious to the truth of their connection to him. Eventually, Alex tracks down Jean and Scott, he kills Jean and defeats his brother. In retribution for Jean&#x27;s death, Weapon X kills Alex by revealing that while Scott blew off Logan&#x27;s hand, his claws were retracted at the time. According to the records of Magneto, Cyclops was incarcerated for his crimes during the reign of Apocalypse.

When Weapon X ascended to the role of Apocalypse in order to appease the Celestials, he donned the moniker Weapon Omega and started resurrecting deceased mutants using energies from a Celestial Life Seed. Cyclops was one of the first to be killed and resurrected by Weapon Omega. Under the control of Weapon Omega, he became one of his closest men and was appointed his Minister of Famine.

When Penance began rallying mutants to her cause which was to seek forgiveness for their past crimes and to rebuild their world, Weapon Omega sent Cyclops along with Azazel and Colossus to confront and bring her into the fold. Penance refused and used her telepathic powers to break Weapon Omega&#x27;s hold on Colossus and restored his memories causing him to side with her. She attempted to do the same to Cyclops but he attacked her with his optic blasts before she could do it. A fight broke out between himself and Colossus but Azazel interrupted it and teleported Cyclops and himself away.

After the fall of the regime of Weapon Omega, Cyclops was chased down and killed by Weapon X.

===Age of X===
In the &quot;Age of X&quot; timeline, where mutants were hunted and prosecuted, Scott was known as Basilisk; having been captured by the government and his eyelids removed to prevent him controlling his optic blasts. Forced into a mask that could only be controlled by the prison staff, he was used as a mutant executioner on Alcatraz until he managed to escape, subsequently providing other mutant prisoners with the opportunity for freedom, although he is constantly forced to deal with his guilt over his role in the deaths of his fellow mutants.

===Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows===
In this continuity, Scott teaches ethics in human-mutant relationships at Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters. When the Super-Human Registration Act was proposed, Professor X and the Avengers proposed an alternative method with self-policing of mutantkind and super-powered communities. Scott thought it was preposterous for Professor X to make himself the self-appointed representative of mutantkind, and his opposition to Xavier&#x27;s proposal led Jean to break up with him and marry Wolverine.

===Corporal Scott Summers===
This Earth 70213 version of Scott Summers was raised as an African American slave, who was recruited by Nick Fury and Doctor Charles Xavier who trained him to use his powers. He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and obtained the rank of Corporal. Due to his efforts along with his fellow black soldiers, James Rhodes and Ororo Munroe, the Civil War ended in merely two weeks. During this period, Scott was stated to have killed about six hundred Confederate soldiers. But despite their efforts and victory, Scott and his fellow mutants were feared by their compatriots.

Scott was recruited by Disembodied Xavier Head to join his inter-dimensional soldiers, the X-Treme X-Force. He faithfully followed X-Force leader Captain Blaire until her death. Afterwards he joined the X-Treme X-Men under Earth-616&#x27;s Dazzler to continue to hunt down evil Xaviers.

He stayed on Earth-616 after the events of &quot;X-Termination&quot;.

===Cyclops of Bishop&#x27;s Future Timeline===
The Cyclops from the same dystopic future timeline as Lucas Bishop has become dependent on cyborg attachments to stay alive. Initially, Cyclops attacks and blames Layla for causing this dystopic future, claiming that she could have used her powers to help mutant-kind. However, Layla explains that despite knowing the bad things that would happen to mutants and herself, she still had to allow them to happen and Cyclops relents.

===DC Comics Metamilitia===
In a pastiche of Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot;, an alternative version of Cyclops named One-Eye appears in the DC Comics series &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; and its tie-in &quot;Lord Havok and the Extremists&quot;.

A former student of Doctor Diehard (a pastiche of Magneto and Professor X) and leader of his &quot;Zen-Men&quot; (a pastiche of the X-Men themselves), he joined the Metamilitia when Americommando became President of the US and approved the &quot;Metahuman Act&quot;. Similar to the unfolding of events during Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Civil War&quot;, the pro-registration heroes subdued the anti-registration ones; unlike the Marvel Universe wherein Cyclops and the X-Men remained neutral in the conflict, the Zen-Men on the alternative Earth of Angor were besieged by the Metamilitia, who feared their power. Although Doctor Diehard assured Americommando of their neutrality, the Zen Men were interned in a concentration camp and inhibitor chips were embedded in their hands. One-Eye switched sides, joining the Metamilitia out of fear and to avoid detention. After witnessing the rape of the Silver Sorceress (a pastiche of the Scarlet Witch) and the murder of her brother Jack B. Quick (a pastiche of Quicksilver), One-Eye damaged his chip and led the Zen-Men in rebellion.

===Earth/Universe/Paradise X===
During the events of the alternative future of &quot;Earth X&quot;, Scott Summers is an old man wandering the country. Summers eventually meets up with the new Daredevil&#x27;s abandoned circus troupe and trains them into a combat team. When referred to as &quot;Professor,&quot; Summers reveals his reservations about the title, stating that he would prefer to be called &quot;Mr. S.&quot; Later in the series Summers leads the animen of Wakanda to the Savageland to create a new home for them.

===Amalgam Comics===
In the &quot;Amalgam Comics&quot; community, Cyclops was combined with DC&#x27;s Ray to create Ray Summers/Apollo.

===House of M===
During the &quot;House of M&quot;, where the main involved heroes&#x27; fondest wishes were granted, Scott was married to Emma Frost, and was a pilot for Mutair Airlines.

===Marvel Noir===
Cyclops appears in &quot;X-Men Noir&quot; as the leader of the X-Men, a crew of talented criminals. He was involved with the late Jean Grey. He has no powers but wields a revolver, and he has one eye scratched out, ostensibly by Logan who was another lover of Jean.

===Marvel Zombies===
Cyclops briefly appears in his original form as one of the characters in the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; universe, fighting against the zombified Alpha Flight alongside his fellow X-Men at the X-Mansion in &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;. However, like many of his comrades, Cyclops unusually succumbs to the zombie infection and becomes one himself. He also fights a zombie Mystique before reaching the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier. He is also seen standing next to Wolverine, Magneto and Colossus on the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier. The last time he is seen before he is turned into a zombie is when he and all the other uninfected heroes are fighting the zombies to get survivors to safety. At the beginning of &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; #1 when Magneto fights the zombified superheroes by launching shards of steel at them, Cyclops is caught in the crossfire and is later seen being shoved away by Wolverine from the corpse of the Silver Surfer. He is then cooked and eaten by the cosmic zombies. As a result, his head has been decapitated by Wolverine and has been ripped out of his zombified body from the same problem as to zombies Wasp and Deadpool (Headpool). On zombie variant covers, he is mostly seen headless and holding his severed head to defeat and eat victims throughout. The zombified Cyclops also appears, as said before, in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days, with zombies Iceman and, ironically, Wolverine.

===Mutant X===
Scott&#x27;s history diverged at a much earlier point in the &quot;Mutant X&quot; reality. In this time line, it was not only the Summers parents who were kidnapped by the Shi’Ar, but Scott as well. While back on Earth, it was Havok who would be discovered by Charles Xavier and eventually grow up to be the X-Men&#x27;s leader, Scott presumably worked as a slave in the Shi’Ar mines. Eventually, he escaped and joined the Starjammers. Among the group, he also found a lover in Carol Danvers. Unlike his brooding counterpart from the main universe, this version of Scott Summers was a happy-go-lucky space pirate. Eventually, one of their adventures led the Starjammers to Earth, where he was briefly reunited with his younger brother after nearly 20 years of not seeing each other.

===New Exiles===
* After the &quot;New Exiles&quot; land on the world of warring empires, they encounter Dame Emma Frost, head of Britain&#x27;s Department X and founder of Force-X. This team includes Summer Scott, a female version of Cyclops who is codenamed Starbolt.
* On the world of the Sons of Iron and Daughters of the Dragon, the New Exiles face a squad of alternative &quot;core X-Men&quot; who are loyal to Lilandra. These X-Men include an alternative (and bald) version of Cyclops whose codename is &quot;Devo&quot;.

===Professor W&#x27;s X-Men===
On Earth-2182, a rather tragic event turned Cyclops into a bitter person in this timeline. At one point, several years in the future, the Shadow King took control of Wolverine and made him kill Professor Xavier. Cyclops never forgave him for this and when, shortly afterwards, Jean Grey was killed, he angrily left the team. In secrecy, Scott assembled a new Brotherhood around himself and one day returned with a vengeance. During the Brotherhood&#x27;s attack on Xavier&#x27;s mansion, Cyclops almost killed Wolverine, who did not fight back at all. It was Nightcrawler&#x27;s daughter, Nocturne, who ended the battle by possessing her teammate, Armageddon, only to use his telekinetic power to pop Logan&#x27;s claws in Cyclops&#x27; chest. To her dismay Scott was stopped but not killed.

===Ruins===
Scott Summers appears as one of numerous mutants at a prison camp in Texas in &quot;Ruins&quot; with his eyes gouged out painfully as a result of accidentally killing his own parents.

===Shadow-X===
New Excalibur battles an evil counterpart of Cyclops, who is a member of the Shadow-X, the X-Men of an alternative reality in which Professor X was possessed by the Shadow King. They are brought to Earth-616 as a result of M-Day. He was later beheaded by Sage.

=== Ultimate Marvel (&quot;Earth-1610&quot;) ===
In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Scott is introduced as the straight-laced field leader of the X-Men. Cyclops&#x27;s age in the Ultimate Marvel continuity is 18 as of his first appearance. His parents died in a plane crash, and he is estranged from his &quot;older&quot; brother Alex, with whom he has not spoken since joining the X-Men. Before becoming part of Professor Xavier&#x27;s dream, Scott dated a young woman named Lorna Dane. Scott is unable to ask his crush Jean Grey on a date, and when she sleeps with Wolverine, Scott leaves the X-Men and joins Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy. Magneto considers Scott a potential heir and urges him to pursue a relationship with his daughter. However, after seeing the lengths to which Magneto will go to fulfill his dream, Scott then betrays the Brotherhood.

During the Weapon X storyline, when agents of Weapon X are trying to take in members of the X-Men, Cyclops is one of the last X-Men standing, causing serious problems for the ground forces attempting to lay siege to Xavier&#x27;s Institute. He is taken out only after Nightcrawler teleports behind him and attacks him.

When Jean dumps Wolverine and begins a relationship with Cyclops, the two men argue over whom Jean loves and fight. Xavier sends the two on a mission to the Savage Land to resolve the rivalry. Scott falls into a chasm and catches himself on a ledge. Wolverine catches him, but allows Scott to fall. Cyclops survives, but is severely injured and unable to stand. He survives by eating insects until he is found by a Brotherhood rescue group in search of mutant survivors of a previous Sentinel attack. Cyclops recovers just as the doctors recognize him and takes them out before they can report him. After recovering, Cyclops contacts the X-Men and proceeds to attack Magneto alone until the X-Men arrive. After Magneto is defeated, Cyclops and Wolverine seem poised for another fight and Cyclops blasts Wolverine with unrestrained optic blast and kicks him off the team. Later, Cyclops finds Wolverine and offers him to return to the X-Men, believing that the school was set up to help mutants and someone like Wolverine needed the help that the school had to offer.

While Cyclops tries to stop Alex from proceeding to the super-criminal prison, the Triskelion, to save Lorna, Alex hits him with a tire iron. Alex claims Cyclops allowed him to do it, because he wants Lorna saved as much as he does.

A few months later, the X-Men are challenged by a new and powerful foe: Cable, who comes from the future to kill Charles Xavier. After defeating the X-Men and seriously injuring Kitty Pryde, Cable escapes to Finland with a kidnapped Jean. Scott and the Professor stayed in the mansion while the rest of the team travel to Europe with help of Bishop, another time-traveler who wishes to stop Cable. The X-Men engage Cable&#x27;s bodyguards, the Six-Pack. Frustrated by being left behind, Cyclops confronts Xavier, who confesses to his pupil that he is in love with Jean. After this confession, both Cyclops and the Professor rush to Finland. A battle between Cyclops and Cable then occurs with neither able to gain the upper hand, until the Professor distracts Cable so that Cyclops can hit Cable in the neck with an optic blast. Cable then detonates some form of hand grenade, while Charles uses his telekinesis to get Cyclops out of the range of the explosion. After the explosion, all that remains is a skeleton that is believed to be the Professor, while Cable is nowhere to be found.

Cyclops, Storm, and Jean are left with all of Xavier&#x27;s possessions. Cyclops makes sure that the school will still exist, but since (according to him) Xavier&#x27;s dream died with him, Cyclops has chosen to disband the X-Men and turn the mansion into just a school. When Bishop challenges Scott&#x27;s decision, Cyclops tells him to form his own team of X-Men. After Bishop and Storm leave the institute to start a new team of X-Men, Cyclops takes the role as Headmaster. Xavier later reveals himself to be alive, having been spirited to the future and trained by Cable to prepare for the rise of Apocalypse, and Xavier resumes his position of Headmaster. Jean manifests the Phoenix and disappears.

Cyclops once again becomes a member of the X-Men. Cyclops acts as a mole for Jean and Xavier to find out who has been supplying the X-Men with the dangerous mutant-enhancing drug, &quot;Banshee.&quot; Discovering that it is Colossus, who needs Banshee in order to move his metal form, he joins their team in order to rescue Northstar. He fakes his first injection, but later takes in order to save his teammates as they fight against Alpha Flight. The injection frees Scott allows him to control his optic blasts without the use of his visor, as he remembers when they first manifested and he accidentally obliterated his foster parents. It also allows him to fly and use his optic energy to increase his strength. He later remains with the splinter group of X-Men, becoming addicted to banshee and engaging in raids to obtain it. He explains that by using Banshee, his entire body is charged with solar energy and channels it through his entire body, rather than just his eyes, granting him the ability to fly, survive the vacuum of space, and perceive, speak with, and attack Jean&#x27;s astral form. He battles against Jean&#x27;s team of X-Men who are attempting to stop the spread of Banshee, abandoning his original goal of protecting his friends from hurting others. After a short and brutal fight, Jean revives Northstar, who ends the fighting, but Scott chooses not to return with the others, flying into space and landing on the moon. Jean follows him and tries to convince him to come back, but Cyclops refuses. As he Banshee wears off and he becomes vulnerable to the vacuum in space, he states that he would rather die than go back to his former self. Jean convinces him to rejoin the X-Men as their leader and encompasses him in her protective Phoenix fire, and puts his protective glasses back on.

During the events of the Ultimate Marvel crossover event &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, Magneto&#x27;s Ultimatum Wave kills Nightcrawler, Beast, and Dazzler. Scott, Jean, and Logan go as the &quot;original X-Men&quot; to stop Magneto once and for all. The remaining X-Men along with the Fantastic Four, Ultimates and SHIELD assault Magneto&#x27;s base, during which they lose several more members including Wolverine, who has his adamantium ripped from his bones by Magneto. In the end Magneto is defeated when Jean Grey downloads Nick Fury&#x27;s memories into Magneto, which reveals that mutants are not the next stage of human evolution, but rather a super-soldier experiment gone wrong. Horrified by the truth, Magneto surrenders, and Cyclops executes him with his optic blast. Cyclops is in Washington with the remaining X-Men, attempting to bring a peace to the anti-mutant hostilities and to ask that all mutants surrender to the government. He is then assassinated by Quicksilver, who lodges a bullet into his skull. Scott dies in the arms of Storm and Colossus, while Rogue rushes a distraught Jean to safety.

====Ultimate Fantastic Four/Ultimate X-Men Annual #1====
In an alternative future timeline of the Ultimate universe, Scott Summers uses the alias of Captain America to fight for mutant justice after losing his powers and Steve Rogers&#x27;s death. He leads a group of X-Men consisting of Shadowcat, Rogue, Wolverine, and a male member using the codename Phoenix, back in time to try to assassinate Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, in an attempt to prevent the events following Ultimatum from ever happening. They capture Reed, but are unable to kill him due to his ability to stretch. It is revealed that their Wolverine was actually a Sentinel impostor, and leads an army of Wolverine Sentinels to kill the future X-Men. Rogue is killed quickly, but Shadowcat and the new Phoenix survive. Scott lives long enough to tell the present day Jean Grey (who united the X-Men and Fantastic Four to save Reed) of the grim future that awaits her, and dies in her arms.

===Ultimate Universe &quot;(Earth-6160)&quot;===
In &quot;Ultimate X-Men,&quot; Natsu Tsukishima is a young Japanese girl who attends Kirigaya Minami Middle School in Kirisaki City along with the rest of this universe&#x27;s X-Men. The name &quot;Natsu&quot; is Japanese for &quot;Summer&quot;, referencing her main continuity counterpart Scott Summers.

===What If?===
In &quot;What If Mister Sinister formed the X-Men&quot;, Cyclops and Havok were raised both by Sinister who formed a team consisting of Cyclops, Havok, Sauron, Sabretooth and Madelyne Pryor (possessed by Malice). Believing the team to be heroes, Cyclops eventually came in conflict with the X-Men and Cyclops and the other team&#x27;s leader, Marvel Girl, instantly grew attracted to each other. Sensing that he was about to lose Scott, Sinister faked his death at the hands of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and asked Cyclops, with his &quot;dying&quot; words, to hold onto Sinister&#x27;s dream. Scott respected his surrogate father&#x27;s last wish and rejected Jean&#x27;s affection, but he and Havok joined the X-Men to secretly undermine them from within.

In &quot;What If Scott Summers and Jean Grey had married earlier&quot;, Cyclops and Jean Grey marry prior to the X-Men&#x27;s mission to Krakoa and decide to leave the team with the rest of the original roster following suit. Scott becomes a radio talk show host and author championing mutant rights, however as a result Xavier accompanies the new X-Men team to Krakoa and is eaten by the island along with them. The Avengers are left to destroy the creature, however by this point Xavier and the other X-Men are dead leaving Cyclops feeling intense guilt.

In &quot;What If Scott Summers and Jean Grey had never fallen in love at all&quot;, Jean Grey actually ends up falling for Angel instead of Cyclops. Because of this, Cyclops never developed into a capable leader but instead withdrew into himself and became more bitter as time went on. As a result, Xavier eventually makes Beast the leader of the X-Men as he does not feel Cyclops is a suitable choice, and in anger Cyclops quits the team and joins Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in forming a new Brotherhood of Mutants.

In &quot;What If Magneto and Professor X formed the X-Men Together,&quot; Cyclops alongside Sabretooth and Havok are seen as members of the Marauders and view a battle at the X-Mansion.

In &quot;What If: Age of Apocalypse&quot;, a timeline where Xavier and Magneto were killed by Legion, Apocalypse was able to rise to power completely unopposed. Scott and Jean attempted to escape his rise to power by hiding out in the Savage Land with their son Nathan, but they were killed by Apocalypse minion Banshee, even as Sauron managed to get Nate to safety.

===Old Man Logan===
In the &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; storyline, Cyclops is among the X-Men who perish at the hands of Wolverine when he is tricked by Mysterio into believing his friends are super-villains attacking the mansion.

===X-Men: Fairy Tales===
Cyclops appears as the main character in the first and third short-story installations of a four-part &quot;X-Men: Fairy Tales&quot; limited series.

*Issue #1
This issue is based around the Japanese fairy tale of Momotarō, only with Cyclops being the boy born out of the peach. He is named Hitome, which can mean &quot;one eye&quot; in Japanese. However, his optic blasts come from only one eye, and are stopped by the pit of the peach he was born from.

Until he is around the age when he joined the X-Men in the regular comics, he lives with the old couple who found the large peach, working as a woodcutter, using his blasts to cut down trees instead of an axe.

When an old monk (Professor X) comes running through the woods, chased by thieves, Hitome comes to his aid. The old monk tells a tale of how he is gathering a group of special people like Hitome in order to rescue the Emperor&#x27;s daughter (Jean Grey), from a group of demons (The Brotherhood of Mutants: Magneto, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Toad).

Along the way, Hitome and the monk gather a team of comrades, some by Hitome&#x27;s cunning, others by his offers of friendship.

* Issue #3
This issue&#x27;s story draws elements from Snow White and stories involving witches.

Scott is a poor blind tailor who discovers a beautiful red-haired woman (Jean Grey) sleeping in a glass coffin in the woods. He awakens her with a kiss and takes her back to the village. Logan, a local butcher, confronts Scott and warns him that the woman is more than she appears to be, and that she presents a threat now that she is awake.

===Deadpool Corps===
Deadpool finds a universe where Prof. X runs a school for troubled kids. Cyclops is shown to be a little kid attending there who is constantly picked on by Kidpool.

===Ultron future===
In &quot;Avengers/Age of Apocalypse&quot;, Scott is shown as part of the forces Kang is shown using to try and defeat Ultron who has destroyed Manhattan in an alternative future. This version of Cyclops can blast beams out of the back of his head as well as the front. He was not killed, so the blast was not from an evil robot minion of Ultron&#x27;s, and Cyclops is shown blasting Ultron at the end of the battle.

===Geshem===
In the graphic novel &quot;Knight of Terra&quot;, set in a fantasy world in which Wolfsbane&#x27;s counterpart is Queen Rain of Geshem, Cyclops&#x27;s counterpart is Lord Summerisle, commander of the Queen&#x27;s Guard. Although he has no mutant abilities, he possessed the Basilisk Mask, which simulates his counterpart&#x27;s optic beams.

<text>The BNC connector is a miniature quick-connect/disconnect radio-frequency connector for coaxial cable. It was introduced on military radio equipment in the 1940s, and has since become widely used in radio systems and as a common type of video connector. It has a twist-to-lock design, where two lugs on the female connector engage slots in the shell of the male one.

BNC is designed to maintain the characteristic impedance of the cable across the connection, and is made in 50-ohm and 75-ohm versions. It is normally used for radio-frequency signals up to about 2 gigahertz and 500 volts.

Similar radio-frequency connectors differ in dimensions and attachment features, and may allow for higher voltages, higher frequencies, or three-wire connections.

== History ==

In 1941, the US Navy used a smaller version of the threaded N connector, the Type BN (Baby N), as the UG-85/U, UG-86/U, UG-114/U and UG-115/U.

In 1943, the British introduced a ¼ inch 50 ohm coaxial cable, and companies immediately developed many connectors for it. In 1944, the US Navy called the designers together to find a single, standard design acceptable to all. Paul Neill, the inventor of the original N connector, developed a prototype connector which had a constant 50 ohm impedance at frequencies beyond 1 GHz, used a bayonet fastening (faster to use than a threaded one), and was easier to manufacture and assemble. It was specified by the Bell Laboratory drawing ESL 662916, dated March 2, 1944.

In April 1944, the Navy took Neill’s design, added a &quot;C&quot; (for &quot;constant impedance)&quot; to &quot;BN&quot; to get &quot;Type BNC&quot; (&quot;Baby Neill Constant&quot;), and assigned part numbers UG 88/U to the male and UG 89/U to the female (Amphenol still makes them). The Navy issued a final drawing RE 49F 246, dated December 2, 1944.

In May 1945, Octavio M. Salati of Hazeltine Corporation applied for a patent for the BNC, which was granted in January 1951. In 1958, Hazeltine sued Dage Electric Company, a maker of BNC connectors, for infringement on this patent. The court found that Salati’s patent was invalid because he knew of the Navy’s BNC before his application date.

==Name==

The US Navy used the term &quot;BNC&quot; to mean &quot;Baby Neill Constant&quot;. 
The term &quot;BNC&quot; appeared in 1948 in ads for Amphenol connectors together with the MIL-spec name &quot;UG-88/U&quot;.

While Paul Neill and Carl Concelman did not invent the BNC, it is often suggested that BNC means &quot;Bayonet Neill–Concelman&quot;. At the time of the BNC development, Concelman worked at Danbury Knudsen and invented the C connector as an improvement to the BNC. In the late 1950s, at Amphenol, Neill and Concelman invented the TNC connector, which could mean &quot;Threaded BNC&quot; or &quot;Threaded Neill–Concelman&quot;. This may have led some to incorrectly assume that they must also have developed the BNC and created &quot;Bayonet Neill–Concelman&quot; as a backronym.

Other suggestions include &quot;Bayonet Navy Connector&quot;: &quot;Bayonet N Connector&quot;, &quot;Bayonet Nut Coupling&quot;, &quot;Barrel Nut Connector&quot;, &quot;Bayonet Nipple Connector&quot;, &quot;Baby N Connector&quot;, &quot;British Naval/National Connector&quot;, and &quot;Berkeley Nucleonics Corporation&quot;.

==Description ==

The BNC connector features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter turn of the coupling nut. It uses an outer conductor with slots and some plastic dielectric on each gender connector. This dielectric causes increasing losses at higher frequencies. Above 4 GHz, the slots may radiate signals, so the connector is usable, but not necessarily stable, up to about 11 GHz. BNC connectors are made to match the characteristic impedance of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms (with other impedances such as 93 ohms for ARCNET available though less common). They are usually applied for frequencies below 4 GHz and voltages below 500 volts. The interface specifications for the BNC and many other connectors are referenced in MIL-STD-348.

==Usage==
The BNC was originally designed for military use and has gained wide acceptance in video and RF applications up to 2 GHz. BNC connectors are used with miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable in radio, television, and other radio-frequency electronic equipment. They were commonly used for early computer networks, including ARCnet, the IBM PC Network, and the 10BASE2 variant of Ethernet.

The BNC connector is used for signal connections such as:
*analog and serial digital interface video signals
*radio antennas
*aerospace electronics (avionics)
*nuclear instrumentation
*test equipment.

The BNC connector is used for analog composite video and digital video interconnects on commercial video devices. Consumer electronics devices with RCA connector jacks can be used with BNC-only commercial video equipment by inserting an adapter. BNC connectors were commonly used on 10base2 thin Ethernet network cables and network cards. BNC connections can also be found in recording studios. Digital recording equipment uses the connection for synchronization of various components via the transmission of word clock timing signals.

Typically the male connector is fitted to a cable, and the female to a panel on equipment. Cable connectors are often designed to be fitted by crimping using a special power or manual tool. Wire strippers which strip outer jacket, shield braid, and inner dielectric to the correct lengths in one operation are used.

==Types and compatibility==
===Types===
BNC connectors are most commonly made in 50 and 75 ohm versions, matched for use with cables of the same characteristic impedance. The 75 ohm types can sometimes be recognized by the reduced or absent dielectric in the mating ends but this is by no means reliable. There was a proposal in the early 1970s for the dielectric material to be coloured red in 75 ohm connectors, and while this is occasionally implemented, it did not become standard. The 75 ohm connector is dimensionally slightly different from the 50 ohm variant, but the two nevertheless can be made to mate. Note that a male 50 ohm BNC has the pin larger than the one of a 75 ohm male, then it can widen the female, causing a fault connection when inserted later a 75 ohm male connector. The 50 ohm connectors are typically specified for use at frequencies up to 4 GHz and the 75 ohm version up to 2 GHz.

Video (particularly HD video signals) and DS3 Telco central office applications primarily use 75 ohm BNC connectors, whereas 50 ohm connectors are used for data and RF. Many VHF receivers used 75 ohm antenna inputs, so they often used 75 ohm BNC connectors.

Reverse-polarity BNC (RP-BNC) is a variation of the BNC specification which reverses the polarity of the interface. In a connector of this type, the female contact normally found in a jack is usually in the plug, while the male contact normally found in a plug is in the jack. This ensures that reverse polarity interface connectors do not mate with standard interface connectors. The SHV connector is a high-voltage BNC variant that uses this reverse polarity configuration.

Smaller versions of the BNC connector, called Mini BNC and High Density BNC (HD BNC), are manufactured by Amphenol. While retaining the electrical characteristics of the original specification, they have smaller footprints giving a higher packing density on circuit boards and equipment backplanes. These connectors have true 75 ohm impedance making them suitable for HD video applications.

===Compatibility===
The different versions are designed to mate with each other,
and 75 ohm and 50 ohm BNC connectors that comply with the 2007 IEC standard, IEC 61169-8, will mate non-destructively. At least one manufacturer claims very high reliability for the connectors&#x27; compatibility. 

At frequencies below 10 MHz the impedance mismatch between a 50 ohm connector or cable and a 75 ohm one has negligible effects. BNC connectors were thus originally made only in 50 ohm versions, for use with any impedance of cable. Above this frequency, however, the mismatch becomes progressively more significant and can lead to signal reflections.

==BNC inserter/remover tool==

A BNC inserter/remover tool, also called a BNC tool, BNC extraction tool, BNC wrench, or BNC apple corer, is a tool used to insert or remove BNC connectors in high density or hard-to-reach locations, such as densely wired patch panels in broadcast facilities like central apparatus rooms.

BNC tools are usually light weight, made of stainless steel, and have screw driver type plastic handle grips for applying torque. Their shafts are usually double the length of a standard connector.

They help to safely, efficiently and quickly connect and disconnect BNC connectors in jack fields. BNC tools facilitate access and minimize the risk of accidentally disconnecting nearby connectors.

==Similar connectors==
Similar connectors using the bayonet connection principle exist, and a threaded connector is also available. United States military standard MIL-PRF-39012 entitled &quot;Connectors, Coaxial, Radio Frequency, General Specification for&quot; (formerly MIL-C-39012) covers the general requirements and tests for radio frequency connectors used with flexible cables and certain other types of coaxial transmission lines in military, aerospace, and spaceflight applications.

===SR connectors===
In the USSR, BNC connectors were copied as SR connectors. As a result of recalculating from imperial to metric measurements their dimensions differ slightly from those of BNC. They are however generally interchangeable with them, sometimes with force applied.

===TNC (Threaded Neill–Concelman)===

A threaded version of the BNC connector, known as the TNC connector (for Threaded Neill-Concelman) is also available. It has superior performance to the BNC connector at microwave frequencies.

===Twin BNC or twinax===
Twin BNC (also known as twinax) connectors use the same bayonet latching shell as an ordinary BNC connector but contain two independent contact points (one male and one female), allowing the connection of a 78 ohm or 95 ohm shielded differential pair such as RG-108A. They can operate up to 100 MHz and 100 volts. They cannot mate with ordinary BNC connectors. An abbreviation for twinax connectors has been BNO ().

===Triaxial===
 Triaxial (also known as triax) connectors are a variant on BNC that carry a signal and guard as well as ground conductor. These are used in sensitive electronic measurement systems. Early triaxial connectors were designed with just an extra inner conductor, but later triaxial connectors also include a three-lug arrangement to rule out an accidental forced mating with a BNC connector. Adaptors exist to allow some interconnection possibilities between triaxial and BNC connectors. The triaxial may also be known as a Trompeter connection.

===High-voltage connectors===

For higher voltages (above 500 V), MHV and SHV connectors are typically used. MHV connectors are easily mistaken for BNC type, and can be made to mate with them by brute force. The SHV connector was developed as a safer alternative: it will not mate with ordinary BNC connectors, and the inner conductor is much harder to accidentally contact.

===Miniature connectors===

BNC connectors are commonly used in electronics, but in some applications they are being replaced by LEMO 00 miniature connectors which allow for significantly higher densities. In video broadcast industry, the DIN 1.0/2.3 and the HD-BNC connector are used for higher density products

<doc id="79120" wikidata="Q176470" url="?curid=79120" title="Interview with the Vampire">
<text>Interview with the Vampire is a gothic horror and vampire novel by American author Anne Rice, published in 1976. It was her debut novel. Based on a short story Rice wrote around 1968, the novel centers on vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac, who tells the story of his life to a reporter. Rice composed the novel shortly after the death of her young daughter Michelle, who served as an inspiration for the child-vampire character Claudia. Though initially the subject of mixed critical reception, the book was followed by many widely popular sequels, collectively known as &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;. A film adaptation was released in 1994, starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, and a television series premiered in 2022. The novel has also been adapted as a comic three times.

== Plot summary ==
A vampire named Louis de Pointe du Lac tells his 200-year-long life story to a reporter referred to simply as &quot;the boy&quot;.

In 1791, Louis is a young indigo plantation owner living in Louisiana. Distraught by the death of his younger brother Paul, he seeks death in any way possible. Louis is approached by a vampire named Lestat de Lioncourt, who desires Louis&#x27;s company. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire and the two become immortal companions.

Louis initially perceives Lestat as an extraordinary being, but he undergoes a rapid disillusionment after joining Lestat as a vampire, as he realizes Lestat has no special moral insights and is in fact not much older than Louis himself. Lestat&#x27;s elderly father moves to the plantation and Louis learns a few details about Lestat&#x27;s boyhood, including that he was denied an education and that his father once considered him the gentlest of his brothers.

Lestat spends time feeding off slaves, thieves, and other plantation families while Louis, who finds it morally repugnant to murder humans to survive, feeds from animals. The enslaved people of the plantation become suspicious of the vampires and Louis and Lestat realize they may face an uprising and cannot remain. Lestat&#x27;s father attempts to apologize for the abuse he inflicted on Lestat as a child, but Lestat remains bitter and aloof and asks Louis to kill his father for him as they prepare to depart.

Louis sets his own plantation aflame; he and Lestat kill the slaves to keep word from spreading about vampires living in Louisiana. Gradually, Louis bends under Lestat&#x27;s influence and begins feeding from humans. He slowly comes to terms with his vampire nature, but also becomes increasingly repulsed by what he perceives as Lestat&#x27;s total lack of compassion for the humans he preys upon.

Escaping to New Orleans, Louis feeds off a plague-ridden, five-year-old girl, whom he finds next to the corpse of her mother. Louis begins to think of leaving Lestat and going his own way. Fearing this, Lestat then turns the girl into a vampire &quot;daughter&quot; for them, to give Louis a reason to stay. She is then given the name Claudia.

Louis is initially horrified that Lestat has turned a child into a vampire, but soon begins to care for Claudia. Claudia takes to killing easily, but she begins to realize over time she can never grow up; her mind matures into that of an intelligent, assertive woman, but her body remains that of a young girl.

Claudia blames Lestat for her state and, after 60 years of living with him, hatches a plot to kill Lestat by poisoning him and cutting his throat. Claudia and Louis then dump his body into a nearby swamp. As Louis and Claudia prepare to flee to Europe, Lestat appears, having recovered from Claudia&#x27;s attack, and confronts them. Louis sets fire to their home and barely escapes with Claudia, leaving a furious Lestat to be consumed by the flames.

Arriving in Europe, Louis and Claudia seek out more of their kind. They travel throughout eastern Europe first and do encounter vampires, but these vampires appear to be nothing more than mindless, animated corpses. Louis begins to regret the murder of Lestat, fearing that they may have killed the one vampire who could provide answers regarding their nature. It is only when they reach Paris that they encounter vampires like themselves, meeting the 400-year-old vampire Armand and his coven at the Théâtre des Vampires.

Inhabiting an ancient theater, Armand and his vampire coven disguise themselves as humans and feed on terrified humans in mock plays before a live audience (who think the killings are merely a very realistic performance). Claudia is repulsed by these vampires and what she considers to be their cheap theatrics, but Louis and Armand are drawn to each other.

Fearing that Louis will leave her for Armand, Claudia convinces Louis to turn a Parisian doll maker, Madeleine, into a vampire to serve as a replacement companion for her. Louis, Madeleine, and Claudia live together for a brief time, but all three are abducted one night by Armand&#x27;s coven.

It is revealed that Lestat survived the fire in New Orleans, scarred and weakened. He demands Claudia face punishment, even death, for her murder attempt but screams at the coven that they promised not to harm Louis. The coven does not respect his ranting and proceed with their punishments. Louis is forcibly locked in a coffin to starve, while Claudia and Madeleine are entrapped in an open courtyard.

Armand arrives and releases Louis, but Madeleine and Claudia are burned to death by the rising sun; a devastated Louis finds their ashen remains. Louis sees Lestat crying over the remnants of Claudia&#x27;s yellow dress, but loses track of him as he plots his revenge against the theatre coven.

Louis returns to the Theatre late the following night, burning it to the ground and killing all the vampires inside, leaving with Armand. Together, the two travel across Europe for several years, but Louis never fully recovers from Claudia&#x27;s death, and the emotional connection between himself and Armand becomes strained. It remains ambiguous even to Louis whether the murder of Claudia was primarily orchestrated by Armand in his desire to gain Louis&#x27;s companionship, by the coven in their perception of Claudia breaking ancient vampire law, or by Lestat&#x27;s arrival and desire for vengeance.

Tired of the Old World, Louis returns to New Orleans in the early 20th century. Living as a loner, he feeds off any humans who cross his path, but lives in the shadows, never creating another companion for himself.

Louis tells the boy of one last encounter with Lestat in New Orleans, where Lestat has hidden himself in a rotting mansion and lost touch with the passing of time. Armand hopes that seeing Lestat might arouse feelings of passion, sorrow, or anger in Louis and expresses despair that Louis remains cold, unreachable, and unable to share eternity with him. The two end their companionship, concluding they have nothing more to offer one another. Louis ends his tale; revealing that after 200 years, he is weary of immortality and of all the pain and suffering to which he has had to bear witness and create.

The boy, however, seeing only the great powers granted to a vampire, begs to be made into a vampire himself. Angry that his interviewer learned nothing from his story, Louis refuses, attacking the boy and vanishing without a trace. The boy then leaves to track down Lestat in the hopes that he can give him immortality.

== Background and publication ==
In 1970, while Anne Rice was attending a graduate program in Creative Writing at San Francisco State University, her daughter Michelle, then about four years old, was diagnosed with acute granulocytic leukemia. Michelle died of the illness about two years later, and Rice fell into a deep depression, turning to alcohol in order to cope. Later reviewers and commentators identified Michelle as an inspiration for the character of Claudia.

In 1973, while still grieving the loss of her daughter, Rice began reworking a previously written short story, which she had written in 1968 or 1969. Thirty pages long, the short story was written from the interviewer&#x27;s perspective. She decided to expand &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; into a novel at the encouragement of one of her husband&#x27;s students, who enjoyed her writing. It took her five weeks to complete the 338-page novel: she did research on vampires during the day and often wrote during the night.

After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says: &quot;What you see when you&#x27;re in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you cannot control it and you go crazy&quot;.

In August 1974, Rice attended the Squaw Valley Writer&#x27;s Conference at Squaw Valley, conducted by writer Ray Nelson. While at the conference, she met her future literary agent, Phyllis Seidel. In October 1974, Seidel sold the publishing rights to &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; to Alfred A. Knopf for a $12,000 advance of the hardcover rights, at a time when most new authors were receiving $2,000 advances. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; was published in April 1976. In 1977, the Rices traveled to both Europe and Egypt for the first time.

Upon its release, &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. A reviewer for the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; gave the book a positive review, describing the prose as &quot;hypnotically poetic in tone, rich in sensory imagery&quot;, while other reviews were more negative. Edith Milton of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote: &quot;To pretend that it has any purpose beyond suckling eroticism is rank hypocrisy&quot;. Leo Braudy writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;[...] the book is too superficial, too impersonal and too obviously made, to touch the sources of real terror and feeling.&quot; , the novel had sold 8 million copies worldwide.

The book spawned a total of twelve sequels, collectively known as &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot;, and the spin-off series &quot;New Tales of the Vampires&quot;. The first sequel, &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;, was published in 1985 and sold more than 75,000 copies in its first printing, garnering largely favorable reviews. 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; improved on &quot;Lestat&quot; numbers, receiving an initial hardcover run of 405,000 and topping the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Rice&#x27;s vampire books share a fictional universe with her series &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; and the novel &quot;The Mummy, or Ramses the Damned&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

=== Film ===
The film rights to &quot;Interview&quot; were at times controlled by Paramount Pictures, Lorimar, and Warner Bros., the distributor of the film, before The Geffen Film Company acquired the rights. Director Neil Jordan rewrote Rice&#x27;s first draft of the screenplay, though she received sole credit. Brad Pitt starred as Louis, Tom Cruise starred as Lestat, Antonio Banderas co-starred as Armand, as did a young Kirsten Dunst as the child vampire Claudia. Most of the movie&#x27;s shooting had been completed by October 1993, and all that remained were the few scenes involving the interviewer that would then be inserted at various points throughout the film. Production of those scenes was put on hold for a few weeks whilst River Phoenix, who had been cast as the interviewer, finished working on the film &quot;Dark Blood&quot;. Phoenix died from an overdose later that month, and Christian Slater was then cast as the interviewer Molloy. Slater donated his entire salary to Earth Save and Earth Trust, two of Phoenix&#x27;s favorite charities.

The film was released in November 1994 to generally positive critical reaction, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Original Score. Dunst was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film. Rice had initially voiced her objections to the casting of Cruise as Lestat, preferring Rutger Hauer for the role. After seeing the film, however, she voiced her support for the film, saying: &quot;That Tom &quot;did&quot; make Lestat work was something I could not see in a crystal ball. It&#x27;s to his credit that he proved me wrong&quot;.

In August 2014, Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment acquired the motion picture rights to the entire &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; series, with producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci signed to helm the potential film franchise. The deal also included a screenplay for &quot;The Tale of the Body Thief&quot; (1992) adapted by Christopher Rice. In May 2016, writer-director Josh Boone posted a photo on Instagram of the cover a script written by him and Jill Killington. Titled &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, it is based on the novel of the same name and its sequel, &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;. However, that November Universal did not renew the contract, and the film and television rights reverted to Rice, who began developing the &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; into a television series with Christopher.

=== Comics ===

Innovation Comics published a twelve-issue comic book adaptation of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; from 1991 to 1994, also making comic adaptations of &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; (12 issues) and &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; (11 issues). A Japanese manga adaptation by Udou Shinohara was published in 1994 by Tokuma Shoten. It was also serialized in both &quot;Animage&quot; and &quot;Chara&quot; magazines. In 2012, the graphic novel &quot;Interview with the Vampire: Claudia&#x27;s Story&quot; was published by Yen Press, retelling much of the original novel from the point of view of child vampire Claudia.

=== Television ===
In May 2020, AMC acquired the rights to &quot;The Vampire Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Lives of the Mayfair Witches&quot; for developing film and television projects. AMC gave the production a series order for a seven episode first season of &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. The series is executive produced by Rolin Jones and Mark Johnson. &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; stars Jacob Anderson as Louis, Sam Reid as Lestat, Bailey Bass/Delainey Hayles as Claudia, and Assad Zaman as Rashid/Armand. The series premiered on October 2, 2022. The novel is adapted through the first two seasons, with elements from &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; being used during season two and being the basis for season three.

<text>In Greek mythology, Electryon (;Ancient Greek: Ἠλεκτρύων) was a king of Tiryns and Mycenae or Medea in Argolis.

== Family ==
Electryon was the son of Perseus and Andromeda and thus brother of Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Sthenelus, Cynurus, Gorgophone and Autochthe. He is most commonly married to Anaxo, daughter of his brother Alcaeus and sister of Amphitryon, but was instead married to Eurydice, daughter of Pelops, in some versions of the myth. His wife bore him a daughter Alcmena and many sons: Stratobates, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, Amphimachus, Lysinomus, Chirimachus, Anactor, and Archelaus. Electryon had an illegitimate son Licymnius by Midea, a Phrygian woman.

== Mythology ==
The six sons of Pterelaus, King of the Taphians, descended from Electryon&#x27;s brother Mestor came to Mycenae to claim a share of kingdom. When Electryon spurned their request, they drove off his cattle; Electryon&#x27;s sons battled against them, and all but Licymnius (on one side) and Everes (on the other) died. Everes sold the cattle to Polyxenus of Elis. Amphitryon, Electryon&#x27;s nephew and promised in marriage to Alcmene, bought the cattle and returned them to his uncle, but accidentally killed him as he threw his club at one of the cows. However, there is an earlier tradition that Amphitryon killed him in a fit of anger over some cattle. Electryon&#x27;s brother Sthenelus seized the throne of Mycenae, charged Amphitryon with murder, and sent him into exile.

<doc id="79126" wikidata="Q644237" url="?curid=79126" title="Louis de Branges de Bourcia">
<text>Louis de Branges de Bourcia (born August 21, 1932) is a French-American mathematician. He was the Edward C. Elliott Distinguished Professor of Mathematics at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, retiring in 2023. He is best known for proving the long-standing Bieberbach conjecture in 1984, now called de Branges&#x27;s theorem. He claims to have proved several important conjectures in mathematics, including the generalized Riemann hypothesis.

Born to American parents who lived in Paris, de Branges moved to the US in 1941 with his mother and sisters. His native language is French. He did his undergraduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1949–53), and received a PhD in mathematics from Cornell University (1953–57). His advisors were Wolfgang Fuchs and then-future Purdue colleague Harry Pollard. He spent two years (1959–60) at the Institute for Advanced Study and another two (1961–62) at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He was appointed to Purdue in 1962.

An analyst, de Branges has made incursions into real, functional, complex, harmonic (Fourier) and Diophantine analyses. As far as particular techniques and approaches are concerned, he is an expert in spectral and operator theories.

==Works==
De Branges&#x27; proof of the Bieberbach conjecture was not initially accepted by the mathematical community. Rumors of his proof began to circulate in March 1984, but many mathematicians were skeptical because de Branges had earlier announced some false (or inaccurate) results, including a claimed proof of the invariant subspace conjecture in 1964 (incidentally, in December 2008 he published a new claimed proof for this conjecture on his website). It took verification by a team of mathematicians at Steklov Institute of Mathematics in Leningrad to validate de Branges&#x27; proof, a process that took several months and led later to significant simplification of the main argument. The original proof uses hypergeometric functions and innovative tools from the theory of Hilbert spaces of entire functions, largely developed by de Branges.

Actually, the correctness of the Bieberbach conjecture was not the only important consequence of de Branges&#x27; proof, which covers a more general problem, the Milin conjecture.

==Controversial claims of solutions to unsolved problems==

In June 2004, de Branges announced he had a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, often called the greatest unsolved problem in mathematics, and published the 124-page proof on his website.

That original preprint suffered a number of revisions until it was replaced in December 2007 by a much more ambitious claim, which he had been developing for one year in the form of a parallel manuscript. He later released evolving versions of two claimed generalizations, following independent but complementary approaches, of his original argument. In the shortest of them (43 pages as of 2009), which he titles &quot;Apology for the Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis&quot; (using the word &quot;apology&quot; in the rarely used sense of apologia), he claims to use his tools from the theory of Hilbert spaces of entire functions to prove the Riemann hypothesis for Dirichlet L-functions (thus proving the generalized Riemann hypothesis) and a similar statement for the Euler zeta function, and even to be able to assert that zeros are simple. In the other one (57 pages), he claims to modify his earlier approach on the subject by means of spectral theory and harmonic analysis to obtain a proof of the Riemann hypothesis for Hecke L-functions, a group even more general than Dirichlet L-functions (which would imply an even more powerful result if his claim was shown to be correct). , his paper entitled &quot;A proof of the Riemann Hypothesis&quot; is 74 pages long, but does not conclude with a proof. A commentary on his attempt is available on the Internet.

Mathematicians remain skeptical, and neither proof has been subjected to a serious analysis. The main objection to his approach comes from a 1998 paper (published two years later) by Brian Conrey and Xian-Jin Li, one of de Branges&#x27; former Ph.D. students and discoverer of Li&#x27;s criterion, a notable equivalent statement of the Riemann hypothesis. Peter Sarnak also gave contributions to the central argument. The paper which, contrarily to de Branges&#x27; claimed proof, was peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal gives numerical counterexamples and non-numerical counterclaims to some positivity conditions concerning Hilbert spaces which would, according to previous demonstrations by de Branges, imply the correctness of the Riemann hypothesis. Specifically, the authors proved that the positivity required of an analytic function &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) which de Branges would use to construct his proof would also force it to assume certain inequalities that, according to them, the functions actually relevant to a proof do not satisfy. As their paper predates the current claimed proof by five years, and refers to work published in peer-reviewed journals by de Branges between 1986 and 1994, it remains to be seen whether de Branges has managed to circumvent their objections. He does not cite their paper in his preprints, but both of them cite a 1986 paper of his that was attacked by Li and Conrey. Journalist Karl Sabbagh, who in 2003 had written a book on the Riemann Hypothesis centered on de Branges, quoted Conrey as saying in 2005 that he still believed de Branges&#x27; approach was inadequate to tackling the conjecture, even though he acknowledged that it is a beautiful theory in many other ways. He gave no indication he had actually read the then current version of the purported proof (see reference 1). In a 2003 technical comment, Conrey said that he did not believe that the Riemann hypothesis was going to yield to functional analysis tools. De Branges, incidentally, also claims that his new proof represents a simplification of the arguments present in the removed paper on the classical Riemann hypothesis, and insists that number theorists will have no trouble checking it. Li and Conrey do not assert that de Branges&#x27; mathematics are wrong, only that the conclusions he drew from them in his original papers are, and that his tools are therefore inadequate to address the problems in question.

Li released a claimed proof of the Riemann hypothesis in the arXiv in July 2008, but it was retracted a few days later, after several mainstream mathematicians exposed a crucial flaw, in a display of interest that his former advisor&#x27;s claimed proofs have apparently not enjoyed so far.

Meanwhile, the &quot;apology&quot; has become a diary of sorts, in which he also discusses the historical context of the Riemann hypothesis, and how his personal story is intertwined with the proofs. He signs his papers and preprints as &quot;Louis de Branges&quot;, and is always cited this way. However, he does seem interested in his de Bourcia ancestors, and discusses the origins of both families in the Apology.

The particular analysis tools he has developed, although largely successful in tackling the Bieberbach conjecture, have been mastered by only a handful of other mathematicians (many of whom have studied under de Branges). This poses another difficulty to verification of his current work, which is largely self-contained: most research papers de Branges chose to cite in his claimed proof of the Riemann hypothesis were written by himself over a period of forty years. During most of his working life he published articles as the sole author.

The Riemann hypothesis is one of the deepest problems in all of mathematics. It is one of the six unsolved Millennium Prize Problems. A simple search in the arXiv yields several claims of proofs, some of them by mathematicians working at academic institutions, that remain unverified and are usually dismissed by mainstream scholars. A few of those have even cited de Branges&#x27; preprints in their references, which means that his work has not gone completely unnoticed. This shows that de Branges&#x27; apparent estrangement is not an isolated case, but he is probably the most renowned professional to have a current unverified claim.

Two named concepts arose out of de Branges&#x27; work: an entire function satisfying a particular inequality is called a de Branges function; given a de Branges function, the set of all entire functions satisfying a particular relationship to that function, is called a de Branges space.

He released another preprint on his Web site that claims to solve a measure problem due to Stefan Banach.

==Awards and honors==

In 1989, he was the first recipient of the Ostrowski Prize and in 1994 he was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research.

In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

<doc id="79127" wikidata="Q25714658" url="?curid=79127" title="Sthenelus">
<text>In Greek mythology, Sthenelus (; Ancient Greek: Σθένελος &quot;Sthénelos,&quot; &quot;strong one&quot; or &quot;forcer&quot;, derived from &quot;strength, might, force&quot;) was a name attributed to several different individuals:

* Sthenelus, son of Perseus and Andromeda. He was the father of Eurystheus.
* Sthenelus, son of Capaneus and Evadne. He fought with Diomedes in the &quot;Iliad.&quot;
* Sthenelus, father of Cycnus and King of Liguria.
* Sthenelus or Sthenelās, king of Argos and son of Crotopus, son of Agenor, son of Triopas. He was the father of Gelanor.
* Sthenelus, an Egyptian prince as one of the 50 sons of King Aegyptus. His mother was a Tyria and thus full brother of Clitus and Chrysippus. In some accounts, he could be a son of Aegyptus either by Eurryroe, daughter of the river-god Nilus, or Isaie, daughter of King Agenor of Tyre. Clitus suffered the same fate as his other brothers, save Lynceus, when they were slain on their wedding night by their wives who obeyed the command of their father King Danaus of Libya. He married the Danaid Sthenele, daughter of Danaus and Memphis.
* Sthenelus, son of Actor and a companion of Heracles, whom he accompanied to the land of the Amazons to take Hippolyte&#x27;s girdle. Ammianus Marcellinus wrote that Sthenelus was killed during the war with the Amazons.
* Sthenelus, son of Androgeos, and grandson of Minos. During Heracles&#x27; journey to retrieve the belt of Hippolyte, while at the city of Paros two of his companions are murdered by sons of Minos, enraging the hero. He kills the sons of Minos responsible for the act, and only ceases the destruction when he is offered to take two hostages, with him choosing Sthenelus, along with his brother Alcaeus.

<text>Brother Cadfael is the main fictional character in a series of historical murder mysteries written between 1977 and 1994 by the linguist-scholar Edith Pargeter under the name Ellis Peters. The character of Cadfael himself is a Welsh Benedictine monk living at the Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, in Shrewsbury, western England, in the first half of the 12th century. The stories are set between about 1135 and about 1145, during &quot;The Anarchy&quot;, the destructive contest for the crown of England between King Stephen and his cousin Empress Maud.

As a character, Cadfael &quot;combines the curious mind of a scientist/pharmacist with a knight-errant&quot;. He entered monastic life in his forties after being both a soldier and a sailor; this worldly experience gives him an array of talents and skills useful in monastic life. He is a skilled observer of human nature, inquisitive by nature, energetic, a talented herbalist (work he learned in the Holy Land), and has an innate, although modern, sense of justice and fair-play. Abbots call upon him as a medical examiner, detective, doctor, and diplomat. His worldly knowledge, although useful, gets him in trouble with the more doctrinaire characters of the series, and the seeming contradiction between the secular and the spiritual worlds forms a central and continuing theme of the stories.

==Name origin and pronunciation==
&quot;Cadfael&quot; is a Welsh name derived from the words (&quot;battle&quot;) and (&quot;prince&quot;). Peters wrote that she found the name &quot;Cadfael&quot; only once in the records, given as the baptismal name of Saint Cadog, who later abandoned it. There are differing pronunciations of the name &quot;Cadfael&quot;; Peters intended the &quot;f&quot; to be pronounced as an English &quot;v&quot; and suggested it be pronounced , although normal Welsh pronunciation would be (approximately ). The name is commonly mispronounced in English (including the television series), and Peters once remarked that she should have included a guide for this and other names in the series that have uncommon pronunciations.

==Background==
Cadfael, the central character of the Cadfael Chronicles, is a Benedictine monk and herbalist at Shrewsbury Abbey, in the English county of Shropshire. Cadfael himself is a Welshman and uses patronymics in the Welsh fashion, naming himself Cadfael ap Meilyr ap Dafydd (Cadfael son of Meilyr son of Dafydd).

He was born in May 1080 into a peasant community in Trefriw, near Conway in Caernarvonshire in north Wales, and had at least one sibling, a younger brother. Rather than wait to inherit the right to till a section of land, he left his home at the age of fourteen as servant to a wool-trader, and thus became acquainted with Shrewsbury early in life. In 1096, he embarked on the First Crusade to the Holy Land in the force commanded by Robert II, Duke of Normandy. After the victorious end to the Crusade, he lived for several years in Syria and the Holy Land, earning a living as a sailor, before returning to England around 1114 to find that Richildis Vaughan, to whom he had been unofficially engaged, had tired of waiting and had married Eward Gurney, a Shrewsbury craftsman. Cadfael became a man-at-arms (foot soldier) in the campaigns waged by Henry I of England to secure possession of Normandy, and returned again to England in the service of a nobleman, Roger Mauduit, who had Prior Heribert of Shrewsbury Abbey kidnapped in an attempt to foil a lawsuit brought against him by the Abbey. Cadfael freed Heribert and, being released from Mauduit&#x27;s service, laid aside his arms and proceeded with Heribert to Shrewsbury Abbey.

In &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Novice&quot;, Cadfael describes his life:

I have seen death in many shapes, I&#x27;ve been a soldier and a sailor in my time; in the east, in the Crusade, and for ten years after Jerusalem fell. I&#x27;ve seen men killed in battle. Come to that, I&#x27;ve killed men in battle. I never took joy in it, that I can remember, but I never drew back from it either. [...] I was with Robert of Normandy&#x27;s company and a mongrel lot we were, Britons, Normans, Flemings, Scots, Bretonsname them, they were there! After the city was settled and Baldwin crowned, most of us went home over three or four years, but I had taken to the sea by then, and I stayed. There were pirates ranged those coasts, we always had work to do. [...] I served as a free man-at-arms for a while, and then I was ripe, and it was time. But I had had my way in the world. [Now] I grow herbs and dry them and make remedies for all the ills that visit us. [...] To heal men, after years of injuring them? What could be more fitting? A man does what he must do.
==Secular experience==
Cadfael became a monk only in middle age and, as a result, is more familiar with the secular world outside the monastery than most of his brother monks. His personality reflects more modern, pragmatic attitudes and progressive ethics than those of his time, which often puts him in conflict with his brethren, particularly with his superior Prior Robert and Robert&#x27;s clerk Brother Jerome, who disapprove of Cadfael for his casual attitude toward rules and for the privileges that are allowed him by their Abbot. In the stories, Brother Cadfael regularly disobeys the heads of his abbey, acts to bring about his own sense of compassionate justice (sometimes against church or feudal law), and does not condemn relationships outside wedlock. Both Abbot Heribert and his successor Radulfus recognise Cadfael&#x27;s unusual skills garnered from a long life as soldier, herbalist, sailor, and traveller. As he has &quot;lived half his life in battles&quot;, they deploy him as detective, medical examiner, diplomatic envoy (to the Welsh princes), and counsel. Abbot Radulfus, who is himself a shrewd and worldly man, allows Cadfael a certain degree of independence and appreciates that there are circumstances under which the rules of the Order must be bent to serve a greater and more practical good. Though indulgent to a certain degree, his patience with Cadfael is not limitless; he reprimands Cadfael when he feels that his lack of monastic discipline and obedience have been excessive and unwarranted.

==Relationships==
On his many travels before the chronicles open, Cadfael had relationships with at least three women: Bianca, a Venetian girl; Ariana, a Greek boat girl; and Mariam, a young Syrian widow, with whom he lived for many years in Antioch. Through the course of the stories, it emerges that Mariam had a son by Cadfael, although he only comes to realise by accident that he is a father (&quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot;). After Cadfael takes vows, he has a close affection for at least two young women: Sioned, the daughter of a Welsh lord (&quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones&quot;), and Godith Adeney (&quot;One Corpse Too Many&quot;). He also enjoys a platonic friendship with the equally worldly Benedictine nun, Sister Magdalen (formerly Avice of Thornbury) of the nunnery close by at Godric&#x27;s Ford (&quot;The Leper of St. Giles&quot;, &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Ransom&quot;, &quot;The Rose Rent&quot;). His former fiancée Richildis, now widowed and remarried, briefly re-appears in his life (&quot;Monk&#x27;s Hood&quot;).

Born in Antioch and named Daoud, Cadfael&#x27;s son never knew his father, but his mother Mariam always described Cadfael (without naming him) in loving terms. Based on this praise, Daoud decides to embrace his father&#x27;s Christianity rather than his mother&#x27;s Islamic faith, and takes the name of his godfather at baptism, Olivier de Bretagne. After Mariam dies, Olivier offers his service to a crusading noble, and quickly becomes his favourite squire (&quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot;). His master supports the Empress Maud, which places him on the opposing side to Cadfael&#x27;s friend Hugh Beringar, though they eventually reconcile their differences. Olivier is presented as the gracious knight and paladin: skilled and brave in battle, &#x27;fiercely beautiful&#x27;, resourceful, resilient, generous and chivalrous; he risks his life to save an enemy who had been keeping him imprisoned in a dungeon (&quot;Brother Cadfael&#x27;s Penance&quot;). His name echoes that of the companion of Roland, hero of the great medieval heroic epics. Olivier comes closer than any other character in the series to fulfilling the ideals of the French-Norman culture, &quot;almost more Norman than the Normans&quot;, perhaps because he has consciously chosen it. In &quot;The Pilgrim of Hate&quot; he is described as having &quot;a long, spare wide-browed face, with a fine scimitar of a nose and a subtle bow of a mouth and the fierce, fearless, golden eyes of a hawk. A head capped closely with curving blue-black hair, coiling crisply at the temples and clasping his cheeks like folded wings. So young and yet so formed a face, east and west at home in it, clean shaven like a Norman, olive-skinned like a Syrian, all [Cadfael&#x27;s] memories of the Holy Land in one human countenance&quot;.

Cadfael works closely with his friend Deputy Sheriff (later Sheriff) Hugh Beringar of Maesbury in the north of the shire, often bending the Abbey rule to travel with or visit him. Beringar, introduced in the second novel, &quot;One Corpse Too Many&quot; (1979), is Cadfael&#x27;s main ally in the pursuit of justice. Beringar swore loyalty to King Stephen when he came of age. Although initially suspicious, the king soon came to trust Beringar and appointed him Deputy Sheriff, and finally Sheriff of Shropshire. At times, Beringar has to choose between loyalty to the Crown&#x27;s justice and Cadfael&#x27;s private view of the injustices of the world. In modern terms, Beringar has the combined role of military governor and police chief.

Cadfael is tolerant and caring towards most of his fellow brothers, but has several particularly close friendships. Brother Mark (&quot;Monk&#x27;s Hood&quot;, &quot;The Leper of Saint Giles&quot; and &quot;The Summer of the Danes&quot;) worked with Cadfael in the herbarium on joining the abbey. Cadfael describes him: &quot;He was my right hand and a piece of my heart for three years, and knows me better than any man living&quot;. Cadfael is also close to Prior Leonard of Bromfield Abbey (&quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot;); Brother Paul, the master of the novices and schoolboys; Brother Edmund the infirmarer, who treats the sick and supervises the Abbey infirmary; and Brother Anselm the precentor, who is in charge of music and the order of the worship services. Cadfael regards Brother Oswin, who becomes his assistant, almost as a son, caring for him deeply and revering his innocence.

He also has a special affection for the martyred maiden Saint Winifred who lies at the centre of the first book in the series, &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones&quot;, (this novel became first of a series only when the second novel relied on Cadfael as the central character), in which Cadfael takes part in an expedition to Wales to excavate the saint&#x27;s bones and bring them to the Abbey in England, establishing it as a pilgrimage site of healing relics. Later recalling the event Cadfael says: &quot;It was I who took her from the soil and I who restored her – and still that makes me glad – from the moment I uncovered those slender bones, I felt in mine that they only wished to be left in peace [...] the girl was Welsh, like me&quot;. Through the series he petitions her for help and talks with her in Welsh, as a down to earth steward of the common people, more accessible than a remote and mysterious God, a local channel of healing and benediction, and though after being miraculously resurrected she in fact lived to a ripe old age, Cadfael always calls her &quot;The Girl&quot;.

==Faith==
Formal religion necessarily forms a central part of Cadfael&#x27;s life as a Benedictine monk, and religion provides the basis for his character as well as for the atmosphere and action of the stories. The Rule of St Benedict is the framework of Cadfael&#x27;s home monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul, just across the river Severn from Shrewsbury. It is noted that in the year 1141, under Abbot Radulfus, 53 brothers, seven novices and six school boys live at the Abbey, not including lay stewards and servants. Their days are structured by the selection of offices they follow; the gathering for prayer at Matins (at midnight) and the following service of Lauds, Prime at 6 am, Vespers at 6 pm and Compline at 8 or 9 pm (depending on the season). The Benedictine order was originally created by Saint Benedict to combine monastic fellowship with physical exertion, mental stimulation and spiritual duties, holding that exercise and physical work would help lead to a healthy soul. It marked a radical departure from earlier orders, establishing a cenobitic community life that was not idealised as austere or penitential. The looser structure, run at the discretion of the abbot, would suit well a man like Cadfael who was in the secular world for forty years before entering the order. It is natural enough that Cadfael, as a world-weary soldier, should seek out that flexibility of this particular order as a &quot;conversus&quot;.

As the monastery&#x27;s highly literate herbalist/gardener, holding a rare skill set in demand in both town and abbey, Cadfael is the equivalent of the medieval physician, possessing an independent authority that sets him aside from his fellows. This enables him to travel, building secular relationships and at times challenging powers within the strong feudal hierarchy. It is the &quot;corporeal works of mercy&quot; that engage Cadfael&#x27;s Christianity, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and healing the sick, rather than preaching. He favours a simple, tolerant and forgiving understanding of Christianity, his practice tending to be based on experience of human frailty rather than contemplation of religious texts. When Shrewsbury is visited by an Inquisition-style orthodoxy (&quot;The Heretic’s Apprentice&quot;) or a harshly punitive version of Christianity (&quot;The Raven in the Foregate&quot;), the stories end with a reaffirmation of the positive, tolerant faith espoused by Cadfael. In a sense he &quot;creates his own theology&quot; to suit the situation; Pargeter herself agreed that Cadfael is a situational ethicist, basing his actions in any given situation on &quot;the right thing to do&quot; rather than on a strict moral code.

The two abbots that rule during Cadfael&#x27;s time at the Abbey of St Peter and St Paul, Abbot Heribert (Herbert) (1128–1138) and Abbot Radulfus (Ranulph I or Ralph) (1138–1148), are both real historical figures. The supercilious &quot;abbot in waiting&quot;, Prior Robert Pennant (1148–1167) succeeded Radulfus some time after the end of the Cadfael Chronicles. The &quot;anxious sweetness&quot; of the fictional Abbot Heribert is set against the proud and ambitious Prior Robert, who Kollman argues &quot;almost becomes the true villain of the series&quot;. Both superiors serve to highlight Abbot Radulfus as the median, the ideal abbot, with whom Cadfael has a deep empathy and understanding. Both Robert and Heribert also serve to show the cloistered and worldly perils, respectively, that Cadfael balances through his &quot;constant war of conscience&quot;. Peters shows Cadfael at the heart of healthy, fulfilling monastic life, which may be flawed by its humanity but is well-intentioned. It is Cadfael, the fulcrum, who helps to maintain the health and perspective that overcomes crises of justice that arise from within and without the community. It may be argued that Peters creates him as a version of St Benedict&#x27;s vision of holy fellowship and service.

==Everyman==
Cadfael is comfortable with Normans as well as Saxons and works across the ethnic divide. He moves easily among the Welsh and the English, speaking both languages, with freemen and villeins, with rich and poor burghers, with members of the low and high aristocracy, within the tribal and feudal communities, church hierarchies and secular; he talks freely with kings and princes. He travelled extensively in Muslim lands and voices respect for their culture and people. He lived with a Muslim woman and journeyed as a sailor. When a villein addresses him as &quot;Master&quot;, Cadfael promptly corrects him: &quot;No man&#x27;s master, every man&#x27;s brother, if you will.&quot;

He is neutral in political matters, refusing to take sides in the civil war between the Empress Maud and King Stephen for control of England. His abjuration of politics is influenced by his holy vows as a monastic brother, but also comes of having fought and seen destruction by political will during the crusades. Cadfael is on good terms with people on both sides of the English war; his best friend Hugh is a staunch supporter of King Stephen, and his son Olivier is just as much committed to the Empress Maud. Cadfael explains his neutrality by saying &quot;In my measure there&#x27;s little to choose between two such monarchs, but much to be said for keeping a man&#x27;s fealty and word.&quot; When witnessing a failed peace conference, Cadfael forms the opinion that Maud&#x27;s half-brother Robert would have made a better monarch than both of them, but for his illegitimate birth (which would not have debarred Robert in Wales, with its law having a different definition of a bastard). However, Cadfael keeps this opinion to himself.

Cadfael has close contacts with the other Welsh people living in Shrewsbury including the boatman Madog, who has an important role in several books. Cadfael likes to speak in Welsh, is exuberant when getting an opportunity to go back into Wales, and feels closer to many Welsh ways of doing things than Anglo-Norman ways: for example, letting all of a man&#x27;s acknowledged children, whether born in or out of wedlock, share in his inheritance; and recognising degrees of crime, including homicide, which allows leniency to killers in certain circumstances, rather than the inflexibly mandatory capital punishment of Norman Law, administered reluctantly by Hugh Beringar and rigidly by his superior, Sheriff Gilbert Prestcote. Cadfael has, however, voluntarily chosen to join an English monastery rather than a Welsh one, and make his home in Englandalthough close to the borders with Waleshis secular history having made him too cosmopolitan to blend in his own homeland. As a Welshman in England, and in concord with his vows, he remains in the world, yet not of it.

==Legacy==

A rose was cultivated in honour of this character. The is a cultivar by Shropshire rose breeder David C.H. Austin, shown first in 1990. It is an English Old Rose Hybrid, available widely.

Cadfael receives an almost certain mention, albeit unnamed, in Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s historical novel &quot;When Christ and His Saints Slept&quot;, set in the same era as the Cadfael novels, where reference is made to a particular monk at Shrewsbury known for his knowledge of herbs and their medicinal uses.

<text>Seven Against Thebes (, &quot;Hepta epi Thēbas&quot;; ) is the third play in an Oedipus-themed trilogy produced by Aeschylus in 467 BC. The trilogy is sometimes referred to as the Oedipodea. It concerns the battle between an Argive army, led by seven champions including Polynices who were called the Seven against Thebes, and the army of Thebes led by Eteocles and his supporters. The trilogy won the first prize at the Athens City Dionysia. The trilogy&#x27;s first two plays, &quot;Laius&quot; and &quot;Oedipus&quot;, as well as the satyr play &quot;Sphinx&quot;, are no longer extant.

==Background==
When Oedipus, King of Thebes, realized he had married his own mother and had two sons and two daughters with her, he blinded himself and cursed his sons to divide their inheritance (the kingdom) by the sword. The two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, in order to avoid bloodshed, agreed to rule Thebes in alternate years. After the first year, Eteocles refused to step down, leading Polynices to raise an army of Argives (captained by the eponymous Seven) to take Thebes by force. This is where Aeschylus&#x27; tragedy starts.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; features little action; instead, the bulk of the play consists of rich dialogues between the citizens of Thebes and their king Eteocles regarding the threat of the hostile army before their gates. Dialogues show aspects of Eteocles&#x27; character. There is also a lengthy description of each of the seven captains that lead the Argive army against the seven gates of the city of Thebes as well as the devices on their respective shields. Eteocles, in turn, announces which Theban commanders he will send against each Argive attacker. Finally, the commander of the troops before the seventh gate is revealed to be Polynices, the brother of the king. Then Eteocles remembers and refers to the curse of their father Oedipus. Eteocles resolves to meet and fight his brother in person before the seventh gate and exits. Following a choral ode, a messenger enters, announcing that the attackers have been repelled but that Eteocles and Polynices have killed each other in battle. Their bodies are brought on stage, and the chorus mourns them.

Due to the popularity of Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Antigone&quot;, the ending of &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; was rewritten about fifty years after Aeschylus&#x27; death. While Aeschylus wrote his play to end with somber mourning for the dead brothers, it now contains an ending that serves as a lead-in of sorts to Sophocles&#x27; play: a messenger appears, announcing a prohibition against burying Polynices; his sister Antigone, however, announces her intention to defy this edict.

The seven attackers and defenders in the play are:

==Mythic content==
The mytheme of the &quot;outlandish&quot; and &quot;savage&quot; Seven who threatened the city has traditionally seemed to be based on Bronze Age history in the generation before the Trojan War, when in the &quot;Iliad&quot;&#x27;s Catalogue of Ships only the remnant &quot;Hypothebai&quot; (&quot;Lower Town&quot;) subsists on the ruins of Thebes. Yet archaeologists have been hard put to locate seven gates in &quot;seven-gated Thebes&quot;: In 1891 Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff declared that the seven gates existed only for symmetry with the seven assailants, whose very names vary: some have their own identity, like Amphiaraus the seer, &quot;who had his sanctuary and his cult afterwards... Others appear as stock figures to fill out the list,&quot; Burkert remarks. &quot;To call one of them Eteoklos, vis-à-vis Eteokles the brother of Polyneikes, appears to be the almost desperate invention of a faltering poet&quot; Burkert follows a suggestion made by Ernest Howald in 1939 that the Seven are pure myth led by Adrastos (the &quot;inescapable&quot;) on his magic horse, seven demons of the Underworld; Burkert draws parallels in an Akkadian epic text, the story of Erra the plague god, and the Seven (&quot;Sibitti&quot;), called upon to destroy mankind, but who withdraw from Babylon at the last moment. The city is saved when the brothers simultaneously run each other through. Burkert adduces a ninth-century relief from Tell Halaf which would exactly illustrate a text from II Samuel 2: &quot;But each seized his opponent by the forelock and thrust his sword into his side so that all fell together.&quot;

The mythic theme passed into Etruscan culture: a fifth-century bronze mirrorback is inscribed with Fulnice (Polynices) and Evtucle (Eteocles) running at one another with drawn swords. A particularly gruesome detail from the battle, in which Tydeus gnawed on the living brain of Melanippos in the course of the siege, also appears, in a sculpted terracotta relief from a temple at Pyrgi, ca. 470–460 BC.

The Epigoni, the sons of the Seven against Thebes, were the mythic theme of the second war of Thebes, which occurred ten years after their fathers had fought in the first war of Thebes.

==&quot;Laius&quot;, &quot;Oedipus&quot; and &quot;The Sphinx&quot;==
Of the other two plays that made up the trilogy that included &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, &quot;Laius&quot; and &quot;Oedipus&quot;, and of its satyr play &quot;The Sphinx&quot;, few fragments have survived. The only fragment definitively assigned to &quot;Oedipus&quot; is a line translated by Herbert Weir Smyth as &quot;We were coming on our journey to the place from which three highways part in the branching roads, where we crossed the junction of the triple roads at Potniae.&quot; The only two fragments definitively assigned to &quot;The Sphinx&quot; were translated by Smyth as &quot;For the stranger a garland, an ancient crown, the best of bonds, as Prometheus said,&quot; and &quot;The Sphinx, the Watch-dog that presideth over evil days.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Translators David Grene and Richmond Lattimore wrote that &quot;the rise of German Romanticism, and the consequent resurgence of enthusiasm for Aeschylus&#x27; archaic style and more direct and simple dramaturgy,&quot; resulted in the elevation of &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot; as an early masterpiece of Western drama. From the nineteenth century onwards, however, it has not generally been regarded as among the tragedian&#x27;s major works. Translators Anthony Hecht and Helen H. Bacon wrote that the play &quot;has been accused of being static, undramatic, ritualistic, guilty of an interpolated and debased text, archaic, and in a word, boring,&quot; though they themselves disagree with such a description.

<text>In Greek mythology, Eteocles (; ) was a king of Thebes, the son of Oedipus and either Jocasta or Euryganeia. Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother without knowing his relationship to either. When the relationship was revealed, he was expelled from Thebes. The rule passed to his sons Eteocles and Polynices. However, because of a curse from their father, the two brothers did not share the rule peacefully and died as a result, ultimately killing each other in battle for control of the city. Upon his death, Eteocles was succeeded by his uncle, Creon.

==Etymology==
The name translates as &quot;truly glorious&quot;, from &quot;eteós&quot; “true” and &quot;kleos&quot; “glory”. The name appears in earlier form &quot;*Etewoklewes&quot; (), attested in Mycenaean Greek tablets as &quot;E-te-wo-ke-le-we&quot;. &quot;Tawagalawas&quot; is thought to be the Hittite rendition of the Greek name.

==Oedipus&#x27;s curse==
In the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, the brothers were cursed by their father for their disrespect towards him on two occasions. The first of these occurred when they served him using the silver table of Cadmus and a golden cup, which he had forbidden. The brothers then sent him the haunch of a sacrificed animal, rather than the shoulder, which he deserved. Enraged, Oedipus prayed to Zeus that the brothers would die by each other&#x27;s hands. However, in Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, Oedipus desired to stay in Thebes but was expelled by Creon. His sons argued over the throne, but Eteocles gained the support of the Thebans and expelled Polynices, who went to Oedipus to ask for his blessing to retake the city, but instead was cursed to die by his brother&#x27;s hand.

==Quarrel over Thebes==
There are several accounts of how Eteocles and Polynices shared the rule after Oedipus&#x27;s departure from the city. In Hellanicus&#x27;s account, Eteocles offers his brother his choice of either the rule of the city or a share of the property. In Pherecydes, however, Eteocles expels Polynices by force, and keeps the rule of Thebes and the inheritance. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; and Diodorus state that the brothers agree to divide the kingship between them, switching each year. Eteocles, however, was allotted the first year, and refused to surrender the crown.

In all of these versions, Polynices gathered the support of the Argives and attacked Thebes, in the war of Seven against Thebes, the subject of Aeschylus&#x27; tragedy &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;. Although Eteocles&#x27;s forces were victorious, the brothers killed each other.

<text>In Greek mythology, Polynices (also Polyneices) (; ) was the son of Oedipus and either Jocasta or Euryganeia and the older brother of Eteocles. When Oedipus was discovered to have killed his father and married his mother, Oedipus was expelled from Thebes, leaving Eteocles and Polynices to rule. Because of a curse put on them by their father, the two sons did not share the rule peacefully. During a battle for control over Thebes, the brothers killed each other.

== Mythology ==

===Oedipus&#x27;s curse===

In the &quot;Thebaid&quot;, the brothers were cursed by their father for their disrespect towards him on two occasions. The first of these occurred when they served him using the silver table of Cadmus and a golden cup, which he had forbidden. The brothers then sent him the haunch of a sacrificed animal, rather than the shoulder, which he deserved. Enraged, Oedipus prayed to Zeus that the brothers would die by each other&#x27;s hand. However, in Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, Oedipus desired to stay in Thebes but was expelled by Creon. His sons argued over the throne, but Eteocles gained the support of the Thebans and expelled Polynices, who went to Oedipus to ask for his blessing to retake the city, but instead was cursed to die by his brother&#x27;s hand. His son was Thersander.

===Quarrel over the rule of Thebes===
There are several accounts of how Eteocles and Polynices shared the rule after Oedipus&#x27; departure from the city. In Hellanicus&#x27; account, Eteocles offers his brother his choice of either the rule of the city or a share of the property. In Pherekydes, however, Eteocles expels Polynices by force, and keeps the rule of Thebes and the inheritance. The &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; and Diodorus state that the brothers agree to divide the kingship between them, switching each year. Eteocles, however, was allotted the first year, and refused to surrender the crown.

Eteocles then has his brother exiled, though Polynices soon finds refuge in the city of Argos. There he is welcomed by the king, Adrastus who gives him his daughter, Argia, for his wife. Polynices then pleads his case to King Adrastus, requesting his help to restore him to the throne of Thebes. Adrastos promises to do so and to that end sets out to gather an expeditionary force to march against Thebes. He appoints seven individual champions to lead this assault, one for each of the seven gates in the walls of the city. Together, these champions, including Adrastus and Polynices, are known as the “Seven Against Thebes”. The expedition soon proved to be complete disaster, as all of the Argive champions (save for Adrastus) were slain in the ensuing battle; Polynices and Eteocles face off against one another in single combat and kill each other.
Ten years after Polynices&#x27; death, the sons of the seven fallen champions gathered to launch a second assault against the city of Thebes to avenge the deaths of their fathers; they are the known as the Epigoni. Unlike their fathers before them, these Epigoni are successful in their attempt to take Thebes, after which they install Thersander, Polynices&#x27; son by Argia, as the city&#x27;s new ruler.

===Burial===

In Sophocles&#x27; tragedy &quot;Antigone&quot;, Polynices&#x27; story continues after his death. King Creon, who ascended to the throne of Thebes, decreed that Polynices was not to be buried or even mourned, on pain of death by stoning. Antigone, his sister, defied the order, but was caught. Creon decreed death, this in spite of her betrothal to his son Haemon. Antigone&#x27;s sister, Ismene, then declared she had aided Antigone and wanted the same fate. Creon imprisoned Antigone in a sepulchre; meanwhile the gods, through the blind prophet Tiresias, expressed their disapproval of Creon&#x27;s decision, which convinced him to rescind his order. He then went to bury Polynices himself, and release Antigone. However, she had already hanged herself rather than be buried alive. When Creon arrived at the tomb where she was to be interred, his son Haemon made as if to attack him and then killed himself. When Creon&#x27;s wife, Eurydice, was informed of their deaths, she took her own life.

<text>In Greek mythology, Haemon or Haimon (Ancient Greek: Αἵμων, &quot;Haimon&quot; &quot;bloody&quot;; &quot;gen&quot;.: Αἵμωνος) was the son of Creon and Eurydice, and thus brother of Menoeceus (Megareus), Lycomedes, Megara, Pyrrha and Henioche. The various sources of his myth present differing and contradictory versions of his story. 

In the version of the myth recorded by Apollodorus and in the Oedipodea, Haemon was killed by the Sphinx. In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;, Haemon was the fiancé of Antigone and killed himself after her death. In Euripides&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;, Haemon marries Antigone and they have a son, Maeon; in his &quot;Phoenician Women&quot; Antigone declares that she will kill Haemon and the engagement is broken. In a version of the myth recorded by Hyginus, Haemon and Antigone have a son but he is murdered by Creon, following which Haemon kills both Antigone and himself.

<text>Creon or Kreon (; ) is a figure in Greek mythology best known as the ruler of Thebes in the legend of Oedipus.

== Family ==
Creon had four sons and three daughters with his wife, Eurydice (sometimes known as Henioche): Henioche, Pyrrha, Megareus (also called Menoeceus), Lycomedes and Haimon. Creon and his sister, Jocasta, were descendants of Cadmus and of the Spartoi. He is sometimes considered to be the same person who purified Amphitryon of the murder of his uncle Electryon and father of Megara, first wife of Heracles.

== Mythology ==

=== First Regency ===
After the death of King Laius of Thebes at the hands of his own son Oedipus, Creon sat on the vacant throne and became the ruler of the kingdom. During this regency, Amphitryon arrived with his fiancée Alcmena and her half-brother Licymnius from Mycenae, seeking exile and purification for the death of his prospective father-in-law King Electryon, whom he accidentally had killed. Creon purified him, and received all three as exiles in Thebes. It was then that Amphitryon gave his sister Perimede as wife to Licymnius. The latter was a bastard son of King Electryon, and the only among the brothers who did not die at the hands of the sons of King Pterelaus of Taphos.

When rancorous Alcmena arrived to Thebes, she declared that she would not marry Amphitryon until he avenged her brothers, who had died during the war between Mycenae and Taphos. Amphitryon then, wishing to marry her but lacking resources for the campaign, asked Creon to assist him.

=== Cadmean Fox ===

And so the rule of Creon, in accordance with the Theban curriculum, began with tribulation. For as soon as he came to power, the wrath of Dionysus was upon the city in the shape of a fox that was fated never to be caught. To this fox (known sometimes as the Cadmean Fox) the Thebans each month exposed one child in an attempt to prevent the beast from carrying off many others.

So, when Amphitryon asked Creon for help, he replied he would join the expedition against Taphos if Amphitryon would rid the country of the plague that was ravaging it. Amphitryon then, not being able to cope with the uncatchable fox, obtained from Cephalus the dog that his wife Procris had received from Minos, which was fated to catch whatever it pursued. And although the dilemma that arose when the two animals confronted each other was of such nature that it required the intervention of Zeus, the problem was nevertheless solved when the god turned both beasts into stone; and so Creon aided Amphitryon and, when the war was over, Alcmena married her fiancé.

=== Creon&#x27;s daughters ===
Some time later Alcmena gave birth to Heracles, child of Zeus and not of Amphitryon, and when this son was grown up, he led the Thebans against Erginus, the king of the Minyans who imposed a tribute after his father was killed by Perieres, charioteer of Creon&#x27;s father Menoceus. It was then that Creon rewarded Heracles by giving him in marriage his own daughter Megara. These two had children: Therimachus, Deicoon, Creontiades, and Ophites, but they were all flung into the fire by their father, when he, in a fit of madness, gave himself to domestic violence. Some say that also Megara died at the hands of her husband, but others say that Heracles gave her in marriage to his own nephew and charioteer Iolaus. It is also said that Creon gave another and younger daughter to Amphitryon&#x27;s son Iphicles, who already was father of Iolaus by Automedusa, daughter of Alcathous, son of Pelops.

=== The Sphinx ===
The most serious trial that Thebes had to confront under the first rule of Creon was, however, the calamity of the Sphinx, which appeared laying waste the Theban fields, and declaring that it would not depart unless someone correctly interpreted a certain riddle which she presented. In order to face this adversity, Creon made a proclamation throughout Hellas, promising that he would give the kingdom of Thebes and his sister Jocasta in marriage to him who solved the riddle of the Sphinx. And since when it comes to acquiring power, property and women, there are always many willing to take whatever risks they deem necessary, going through no matter which atrocities, many came and many were destroyed by the Sphinx, who gobbled them up one by one — the price of failure to solve her riddle.

But since all calamities must end some day, the Sphinx was finally defeated by Oedipus, who, having heard Creon&#x27;s proclamation, came to Thebes and, by solving the riddle, caused the beast to destroy itself. And since Creon fulfilled his promise, Oedipus received both the throne of his own father, whom he had murdered for a trifle on a road not knowing who the man was, and Creon&#x27;s sister Jocasta as wife, unaware that this woman was his own mother. These are the bizarre gifts with which Creon rewarded Oedipus for having destroyed the Sphinx.

=== End of first rule ===
In this manner ended the first rule of Creon. And whereas some might say his decisions on this important matter were evil, others would absolve him, arguing that Creon had no idea who Oedipus was. Therefore, they would say, Creon could not be blamed, and nor could Oedipus, who didn&#x27;t know his own identity. And, since these two opinions cannot be reconciled, a third may appear — against all sense — blaming the gods, or Fate, or Fortune, or some other force from above or below. And still others might maintain that Oedipus was, in any case, guilty of murder: for he killed not one man, but two, and for a trivial matter; and Creon could be deemed to have been out of his mind when he offered both throne and queen to a complete unknown on the ground of one single merit. Therefore, they might add, both were guilty, not so much of the offenses that made them famous, but of other faults; and being the one criminal, and the other incompetent, they were both punished and more calamities followed.

== Theban cycle ==

===In Sophocles===
Creon figures prominently in the plays &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, and &quot;Antigone&quot;, written by Sophocles.

====&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;====
In &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, Creon is a brother of queen Jocasta, the wife of King Laius as well as Oedipus. Laius, a previous king of Thebes, had given the rule to Creon while he went to consult the oracle at Delphi. During Laius&#x27;s absence, the Sphinx came to Thebes. When word came of Laius&#x27;s death, Creon offered the throne of Thebes as well as the hand of his sister (and Laius&#x27;s widow) Jocasta, to anyone who could free the city from the Sphinx. Oedipus answered the Sphinx&#x27;s riddle and married Jocasta, unaware that she was his mother. Over the course of the play, as Oedipus comes closer to discovering the truth about Jocasta, Creon plays a constant role close to him. When Oedipus summons Tiresias to tell him what is plaguing the city and Tiresias tells him that he is the problem, Oedipus accuses Creon of conspiring against him. Creon argues that he does not want to rule and would, therefore, have no incentive to overthrow Oedipus. However, when the truth is revealed about Jocasta, and Oedipus requests to be exiled, it is Creon who grants his wish and takes the throne in his stead.

====&quot;Antigone&quot;====
In &quot;Antigone&quot;, Creon is the ruler of Thebes. Oedipus&#x27;s sons, Eteocles and Polynices, had shared the rule jointly until they quarreled, and Eteocles expelled his brother. In Sophocles&#x27; account, the two brothers agreed to alternate rule each year, but Eteocles decided not to share power with his brother after his tenure expired. Polynices left the kingdom, gathered an army and attacked the city of Thebes in the war of the Seven against Thebes.

The Thebans won the war, but both sons of Oedipus were killed, leaving Creon as ruler once more, serving as regent for Laodamas, the son of Eteocles. Creon gives Eteocles a full and honorable burial, but orders (under penalty of death) that Polynices&#x27; corpse be left to rot on the battlefield as punishment for his treason. Such state of non-burial was considered a frightening and terrible prospect in the culture of ancient Greece. Antigone, the daughter of Oedipus and Jocasta, who is betrothed to Creon&#x27;s son Haemon, defies him by burying her brother, and is condemned to be entombed alive as punishment. Antigone tells Creon that it is the duty of the living to bury the dead and that if a body is not buried then the one who died will wander around in nowhere aimlessly for all eternity. Creon finally relents, following advice from the chorus leader (&quot;choragos&quot;), after Tiresias tells him to bury the body. However, when Creon arrives at the tomb where she was to be interred, Antigone has already hanged herself rather than be buried alive. His son, Haemon, threatens him and tries to kill him but ends up taking his own life.

In Creon&#x27;s old age, a descendant of an earlier king of Thebes named Lycus invades Thebes and, after killing Creon, takes the crown.

==Character traits==
Creon is pitted against Antigone, who holds up the will of the gods and the honor of her family above all else; and thus he appears to be against these values. His behavior, however, suggests otherwise. He aggressively preaches the concept of family honor to his son, Haemon. Creon also believes that his decrees are consistent with the will of the gods and with the best interests of the people, whether true or not. When a legitimate argument is raised against his course of action by Tiresias, he is in fact completely open to changing course, even before he learns of the deaths of his family members.

==Discrepancies==
The Creon of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; is in some ways different and in some ways similar to the Creon of &quot;Antigone&quot;. In &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, he appears to favor the will of the gods above decrees of state. Even when Oedipus says that, once dethroned, he must be exiled, Creon waits for the approval of the gods to carry out the order once he has been crowned king.

Some explanation for these discrepancies in personality may be drawn from his characterization in the third of the Oedipus plays by Sophocles, &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;. Here, Creon takes on another persona: that of the &quot;hard-faced politician&quot;. He is reasonable and modest, staying calm and maintaining his dignity when condemned by Theseus. He is a &quot;colorless figure&quot; beyond his official position, which suggests that his differing personality traits in the books are because he is a flexible figure whom poets can characterize as they please.

==Other representations==
Creon is also featured in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Phoenician Women&quot;, but not in &quot;Medea&quot;—the latter had a different Creon.

Creon is portrayed as a tyrant in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and in a later adaptation of the same story, William Shakespeare&#x27;s and John Fletcher&#x27;s play &quot;The Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;. As in &quot;Antigone&quot;, he refuses to allow the burial of defeated enemies. His enemies&#x27; widows appeal to Theseus, who defeats Creon in battle. Though much discussed, he does not appear as a character in either version.

The Roman poet Statius recounts a differing version of Creon&#x27;s assumption of power from that followed by Sophocles, in his first-century epic, the &quot;Thebaid&quot;. This alternate narrative may have been based on a previous epic of the Theban cycle written by the Greek poet Antimachus in the 4th or 5th century BC. Antimachus&#x27; work has been lost, but in any case, the classic myths often had more than one variation, and playwrights and poets had some freedom to choose or even innovate for dramatic effect.

<text>The [[Amiga]] 3000, or A3000, is a personal computer released by Commodore in June 1990. It is the successor to the Amiga 2000 and its upgraded model Amiga 2500 with more processing speed, improved graphics, and a new revision of the operating system.

Its predecessors, the Amiga 500, 1000 and 2000, share the same fundamental system architecture and consequently perform without much variation in processing speed despite considerable variation in purchase price. The A3000 however, was entirely reworked and rethought as a high-end workstation. The new Motorola 32-bit 68030 CPU, 68882 math co-processor, and 32-bit system memory increase the integer processing speed by a factor of 5 to 18, and the floating-point processing speed by a factor of 7 to 200 times. The new 32-bit Zorro III expansion slots provide for faster and more powerful expansion capabilities.

In common with earlier Amigas the 3000 runs a 32-bit operating system called AmigaOS. Version 2.0 is generally considered to have a more ergonomic and attractive interface than previous versions, which were designed with television sets as a lowest common denominator display. Access for application developers was simplified.

The A3000UX is an A3000 variant bundled with the UNIX System V operating system. Commodore had a licensing agreement with AT&amp;T to include a port of Unix System V (release 4). Commodore also sold a tower variant called the A3000T.

An enhanced version, the Amiga 3000+, with the AGA chipset and an AT&amp;T DSP3210 signal processing chip was produced to prototype stage in 1991. Although this system was never released, Commodore&#x27;s negotiations with AT&amp;T over the proper way to bundle their VCOS/VCAS operating system software in a personal computer environment helped Apple Computer deliver their Quadra 660 and Quadra 840 AV-series Macintosh systems, two years later. 
Instead of the Amiga 3000+, Commodore replaced the A3000 six months behind schedule, in the fall of 1992, with the A4000.

The machine is reported to have sold 14,380 units in Germany (including Amiga 3000T sales).

==Technical information==
The Amiga 3000 shipped with a Motorola 68030 at either 16 or 25 MHz and 2 MB of RAM. It includes the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS), a display enhancer for use with a VGA monitor, and a DMA SCSI-1 controller and hard disk drive.

&quot;Fast RAM&quot; can be increased by fitting DIP (up to 4 MB) or ZIP DRAM chips (up to 16 MB) available in two varieties, Page Mode or Static Column.

The A3000, unlike most Amiga models, supports both ROM-based Kickstarts and disk-based Kickstarts (the early &quot;SuperKickstart&quot; model), although not simultaneously. Kickstart V1.4 is actually a beta version of Kickstart which is loaded from disk. 68040 microprocessors require at least 2.0 ROMs.

The A3000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors including two DE-9 ports for joysticks, mice, and light pens, a standard 25-pin RS-232 serial port and a 25-pin Centronics parallel port. As a result, at launch the A3000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as MIDI devices, serial modems, and sound samplers.

The A3000 has four internal 32-bit Zorro III expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the AutoConfig standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, and later even USB controllers.

The two passive ISA slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board IBM-PC-compatible hardware, including Intel 80286, 80386 or 80486 microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM PC system in hardware. A compatible ISA card may then be installed in the remaining ISA slot.

<doc id="79145" wikidata="Q656881" url="?curid=79145" title="Tiresias">
<text>In Greek mythology, Tiresias (; ) was a blind prophet of Apollo in Thebes, famous for clairvoyance and for being transformed into a woman for seven years. He was the son of the shepherd Everes and the nymph Chariclo. Tiresias participated fully in seven generations in Thebes, beginning as advisor to Cadmus, the founder of Thebes.

==Mythology==
Eighteen allusions to mythic Tiresias, noted by Luc Brisson, fall into three groups: the first recounts Tiresias&#x27; sex-change episode and later his encounter with Zeus and Hera; the second group recounts his blinding by Athena; the third, all but lost, seems to have recounted the misadventures of Tiresias.

=== Sex-change ===

On Mount Cyllene in the Peloponnese, Tiresias came upon a pair of copulating snakes and hit them with his stick, which displeased goddess Hera who punished Tiresias by transforming him into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married and had children, including his daughter Manto who also possessed the gift of prophecy. Afterwards, as told by Phlegon, god of prophecy Apollo informed Tiresias: if she spots copulating snakes and similarly harms them, she will return to her previous form. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias found mating snakes; depending on the myth, she either made sure to leave the snakes alone this time, or, according Hyginus and Phlegon, trampled them. In both outcomes, Tiresias was released from the sentence and changed back to a man.
According to Eustathius, Tiresias was originally a woman who promised Apollo her favours in exchange for musical lessons, only to reject him afterwards. She was turned by Apollo into a man, then again a woman under unclear circumstances, then a man by the offended Hera, then into a woman by Zeus. She became a man once again after an encounter with the Muses, until finally Aphrodite turned him into a woman again and then into a mouse.

=== Blindness and gift of prophecy ===
The mythographic compendium &quot;Bibliotheke&quot;, lists different stories about the possible cause of Tiresias&#x27; blindness. One legend says he was &quot;blinded by the gods because he revealed their secrets to men&quot;. While Pherecydes and Callimachus&#x27; fifth hymn, &quot;The Baths of Pallas&quot;, provided a different story—&quot;the youthful Tiresias&quot; was blinded by Athena after he came to sate his thirst at the bubbling spring, where Athena and her favourite attendant, the nymph Chariclo (mother of Tiresias) were enjoying a &quot;cool plunge in the fair-flowing spring of Hippocrene on Mount Helicon&quot;. Pherecydes, in particular, finishes the story with Tiresias&#x27; mother Chariclo begging Athena to undo the curse, but she &quot;could not do so&quot;. Instead, Athena &quot;cleansed his ears&quot;, giving him the ability to understand birdsong (gift of augury), and granted him a staff of cornel-wood, &quot;wherewith he walked like those who see&quot;. In the version retold by Callimachus, Athena cried out in anger at the sight of Tiresias, and his eyes were &quot;quenched in darkness&quot;. After Chariclo &quot;reproached the goddess with blinding her son, Athena explained that she had not done so, but that the laws of the gods inflicted the penalty of blindness on anyone who beheld an immortal without his or her consent.&quot; To give Tiresias solace in his grief, Athena &quot;promised to bestow on him the gifts of prophecy and divination, long life, and after death the retention of his mental powers undimmed&quot; by the underworld.

On another account behind Tiresias&#x27; blindness and his gift, he was drawn into an argument between goddess Hera and her husband Zeus, arguing whether &quot;the pleasures of love are felt more by women or by men&quot;, with Hera taking the side of men, Zeus putting himself in opposition, and Tiresias making the final judgement as someone who had experienced both pleasures. Tiresias said, &quot;Of ten parts a man enjoys one only; But a woman enjoys the full ten parts in her heart&quot;. Hera struck him blind, but Zeus, in recompense, gave Tiresias the gift of foresight and a lifespan of &quot;seven ordinary lives&quot;.

Like other oracles, the circumstances in which Tiresias received his prophecies varied. Sometimes he would receive visions, listen for the songs of birds, or burn offerings or entrails, interpreting prophecies through pictures that appeared in the smoke. Pliny the Elder credited Tiresias with the invention of augury. Journalist William Godwin highlighted the communications with the dead as his most valuable way to tell a prophecy, constraining the dead &quot;to appear and answer his inquiries&quot;.

===Other myths===
In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, Tiresias&#x27; &quot;fame of prophecy was spread through all the cities of Aonia&quot;, and nymph Liriope was the first to request his prophecy, asking him about the future of her son Narcissus. Tiresias predicted that the boy would live a long life only if he never &quot;came to know himself&quot;.

Tiresias has been a recurring character in stories and Greek tragedies concerning the legendary history of Thebes.
*In Euripides&#x27;s &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, Tiresias and Cadmus, the founder and former king of Thebes, joined the ritual festivities of Dionysus in the mountains near Thebes. Cadmus&#x27; petulant young grandson Pentheus, the current king, observed the scene, disgusted to find the two old men in festival dress, he scolded them and ordered his soldiers to arrest anyone engaging in Dionysian worship.
*In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, the city of Thebes was struck by a plague of infertility, affecting crops, livestock, and the people. King Oedipus asserted that he would end the pestilence. He sent Creon, the brother of his consort, to the Oracle at Delphi, seeking guidance. When Creon returned, Oedipus learned that the tragic death of the previous king Laius brought the plague, and his murder must be brought to justice to save the city. Creon also suggested that they try to find Tiresias, who was widely respected. Oedipus sent for Tiresias, and Tiresias admitted to knowing the answers to Oedipus&#x27; questions, but he refused to speak, instead telling Oedipus to abandon his search. Angered by the seer&#x27;s reply, Oedipus accused him of complicity in Laius&#x27; murder, which offended Tiresias. Tiresias revealed to the king that &quot;you yourself are the criminal you seek&quot;. Oedipus did not understand how this could be, and supposed that Creon must have paid Tiresias to accuse him. The two argued vehemently, and Jocasta entered and tried to calm Oedipus by telling him the story of her first-born son and his supposed death. Oedipus became nervous as he realized that he may have murdered Laius and so brought about the plague. The prophet left.
*In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Antigone&quot;, Creon, now king of Thebes, refused to allow the burial of Creon&#x27;s nephew Polynices and decreed to bury alive his niece, Antigone, for defying the order. Tiresias warned him that Polynices should be urgently buried because the gods were displeased, refusing to accept any sacrifices or prayers from Thebes. However, Creon accused Tiresias of being corrupt. Tiresias responded that Creon would lose &quot;a son of [his] own loins&quot; for the crimes of leaving Polynices unburied and putting Antigone into the earth. Tiresias also prophesied that all of Greece would despise Creon and that the sacrificial offerings of Thebes would not be accepted by the gods. The leader of the Chorus, terrified, asked Creon to take Tiresias&#x27; advice to free Antigone and bury Polynices. Creon assented, leaving with a retinue of men.
*According to Hyginus and Statius, during the reign of Eteocles, the son of Oedipus, the city of Thebes has been attacked by Seven against Thebes and laid siege to the city. Tiresias foretold that if anyone from the Spartoi perish freely as sacrifice to Ares, Thebes would be freed from disaster. Creon&#x27;s son Menoeceus committed suicide by throwing himself from the walls, and Thebes ultimately emerged victorious.

===Death===

Tiresias died after drinking water from the tainted spring Tilphussa, where he was impaled by an arrow of Apollo. As claimed by Pausanias, the tomb of Tiresias was &quot;ordinarily pointed out in the vicinity&quot; of the Tilphusan Well near Thebes, Greece, while Pliny the Elder wrote that his burial site was located in Macedonia, marked with a monument.

His shade descended to the Asphodel Meadows, the first level of Hades. Persephone allowed Tiresias to retain his powers of clairvoyance after death.

After his death, the spirit of Tiresias was summoned from the underworld by Odysseus&#x27; sacrificial offering of a black sheep. Tiresias told Odysseus that he could return home if he was able to stay himself and his crew from eating the sacred livestock of Helios on the island of Thrinacia and that failure to do so would result in the loss of his ship and his entire crew. Odysseus&#x27; men, however, did not follow the advice and were killed by Zeus&#x27; thunderbolts during a storm.

The souls inhabiting the underworld were usually required to drink the blood to become conscious again, but Tiresias was able to see Odysseus without drinking the blood. According to historian Marina Warner, it meant Tiresias remained sentient even in death—&quot;he comes up to Odysseus and recognizes him and calls him by name before he has drunk the black blood of the sacrifice; even Odysseus&#x27; own mother cannot accomplish this, but must drink deep before her ghost can see her son for himself.&quot;

==Analysis==
As a seer, &quot;Tiresias&quot; was &quot;a common title for soothsayers throughout Greek legendary history&quot;. In Greek literature, Tiresias&#x27; pronouncements are always given in short maxims which are often cryptic (gnomic), but never wrong. Often when his name is attached to a mythic prophecy, it is introduced simply to supply a personality to the generic example of a seer, not by any inherent connection of Tiresias with the myth: thus it is Tiresias who tells Amphitryon of Zeus and Alcmena and warns the mother of Narcissus that the boy will thrive as long as he never knows himself. This is his emblematic role in tragedy. Like most oracles, he is generally extremely reluctant to offer the whole of what he sees in his visions.

Tiresias is presented as a complex liminal figure, mediating between humankind and the gods, male and female, blind and seeing, present and future, this world and the Underworld.

Brisson made connections between the paired serpents struck by Tiresias and the caduceus.

==In other cultures==
Some theories hypothesize that Baba Yaga is a Slavic folklore version of Tiresias.

==In the arts==
* The figure of Tiresias has been much invoked by fiction writers and poets. At the climax of Lucian of Samosata&#x27;s &quot;Necyomantia&quot;, Tiresias in Hades is asked &quot;what is the best way of life?&quot; to which he responds, &quot;the life of the ordinary guy: forget philosophers and their metaphysics.&quot;
* Tiresias appears in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;, in Canto XX, among the soothsayers in the Fourth Bolgia of the Eighth Circle, where augurs are punished by having their heads turned backwards; since they claimed to see the future in life, in the afterlife they are denied any forward vision.
* &quot;The Breasts of Tiresias&quot; () is a surrealist play by Guillaume Apollinaire written in 1903. The play received its first production in a revised version in 1917. In his preface to the play, the poet invented the word &quot;surrealism&quot; to describe his new style of drama. The French composer Francis Poulenc wrote an opera with the same name based on Apollinaire&#x27;s 1917 play. It was first performed at the Opéra-Comique in 1947.
* &quot;Tiresias&quot; the poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, narrated by the persona Tiresias himself, incorporates the notion that his prophecies, though always true, are generally not believed.
* Tiresias is featured in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (Section III, The Fire Sermon) and in a note Eliot states that Tiresias is &quot;the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest.&quot;
* Tiresias appears in Three Cantos III (1917) and cantos I and 47 in the long poem &quot;The Cantos&quot; by Ezra Pound.
* Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;&quot; is a modernist novel that uses major events in Tiresias&#x27; life.
* &quot;Tiresias&quot; is a ballet choreographed by Frederick Ashton to music by Constant Lambert first performed at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, London, on 9 July 1951.
* &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;, a song by the British progressive rock band Genesis from the 1973 album &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; refers to Tiresias&#x27;s sex change experience: &quot;I have crossed between the poles, for me there&#x27;s no mystery. Once a man, like the sea I raged, once a woman, like the earth I gave&quot;.
* &quot;Castle Walls&quot;, a song by American progressive rock band Styx on their 1977 album &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot;, makes reference to Tiresias in the refrain &quot;Far beyond these castle walls; Where I thought I heard Tiresias say; Life is never what it seems; And every man must meet his destiny&quot;.
* &quot;Tiresia&quot;, a 2003 French film directed by Bertrand Bonello uses the legend of Tiresias to tell the story of a modern transgender person.
* Carol Ann Duffy&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Wife&quot; includes the poem &quot;&quot;from&quot; Mrs Tiresias&quot; which narrates the experience of Tiresias&#x27;s wife after his transformation.

<doc id="79150" wikidata="Q673184" url="?curid=79150" title="Feigenbaum constants">
<text>In mathematics, specifically bifurcation theory, the Feigenbaum constants and are two mathematical constants which both express ratios in a bifurcation diagram for a non-linear map. They are named after the physicist Mitchell J. Feigenbaum.

==History==
Feigenbaum originally related the first constant to the period-doubling bifurcations in the logistic map, but also showed it to hold for all one-dimensional maps with a single quadratic maximum. As a consequence of this generality, every chaotic system that corresponds to this description will bifurcate at the same rate. Feigenbaum made this discovery in 1975, and he officially published it in 1978.

==The first constant==
The first Feigenbaum constant or simply Feigenbaum constant is the limiting ratio of each bifurcation interval to the next between every period doubling, of a one-parameter map
:formula_1
where is a function parameterized by the bifurcation parameter .

It is given by the limit: 
:formula_2
where are discrete values of at the th period doubling.

This gives its numerical value: 

formula_3
* A simple rational approximation is: , which is correct to 5 significant values (when rounding). For more precision use , which is correct to 7 significant values.
* Is approximately equal to , with an error of 0.0047%

===Illustration===

====Non-linear maps====
To see how this number arises, consider the real one-parameter map
:formula_4
Here is the bifurcation parameter, is the variable. The values of for which the period doubles (e.g. the largest value for with no orbit, or the largest with no orbit), are , etc. These are tabulated below:

The ratio in the last column converges to the first Feigenbaum constant. The same number arises for the logistic map
:formula_5
with real parameter and variable . Tabulating the bifurcation values again:

====Fractals====
In the case of the Mandelbrot set for complex quadratic polynomial
:formula_6
the Feigenbaum constant is the limiting ratio between the diameters of successive circles on the real axis in the complex plane (see animation on the right).

Bifurcation parameter is a root point of period- component. This series converges to the Feigenbaum point = −1.401155... The ratio in the last column converges to the first Feigenbaum constant.

Other maps also reproduce this ratio; in this sense the Feigenbaum constant in bifurcation theory is analogous to  in geometry and in calculus.

==The second constant==
The second Feigenbaum constant or Feigenbaum reduction parameter is given by: 
:formula_7
It is the ratio between the width of a tine and the width of one of its two subtines (except the tine closest to the fold). A negative sign is applied to when the ratio between the lower subtine and the width of the tine is measured.

These numbers apply to a large class of dynamical systems (for example, dripping faucets to population growth).

A simple rational approximation is × × = .

==Properties==
Both numbers are believed to be transcendental, although they have not been proven to be so. In fact, there is no known proof that either constant is even irrational.

The first proof of the universality of the Feigenbaum constants was carried out by Oscar Lanford—with computer-assistance—in 1982 (with a small correction by Jean-Pierre Eckmann and Peter Wittwer of the University of Geneva in 1987). Over the years, non-numerical methods were discovered for different parts of the proof, aiding Mikhail Lyubich in producing the first complete non-numerical proof.

== Other values ==
The period-3 window in the logistic map also has a period-doubling route to chaos, reaching chaos at formula_8, and it has its own two Feigenbaum constants: formula_9.

<doc id="79151" wikidata="Q591089" url="?curid=79151" title="Alcmaeon (mythology)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Alcmaeon (; Ancient Greek: Ἀλκμαίων &quot;Alkmaíōn&quot;), as one of the Epigoni, was the leader of the Argives who attacked Thebes, taking the city in retaliation for the deaths of their fathers, the Seven against Thebes, who died while attempting the same thing.

== Family ==
Alcmaeon was the son of Amphiaraus and Eriphyle and brother of Amphilochus. He had many progeny by different women including Clytius by Alphesiboea or Arsinoe, daughter of Phegeus; Amphoterus and Acarnan by Callirhoe, daughter of Achelous and lastly Amphilochus and Tisiphone by Manto, daughter of Tiresias.

His son Clytius founded the Klytidiai, a clan of seers in Elis who interpreted the oracles of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.

== Mythology ==

=== The second Theban war ===
Pindar&#x27;s eighth Pythian ode relates a prophecy by Amphiaraus that the Epigoni will conquer Thebes, and that Alcmaeon will be the first through the gates. The mythographer Apollodorus, also states that the other Epigoni received an oracle instructing them to make Alcmaeon their leader, and therefore convinced him to go with them, although he was unwilling. In Diodorus, Eriphyle persuades her son to join the attackers because she is bribed by Thersander to do so in exchange for the robe of Harmonia, just as she was bribed by Polynices with the necklace of Harmonia to send her husband Amphiaraus into battle. However, according to Asclepiades of Tragilus, Amphiaraus orders Alcmaeon to avenge him on Eriphyle as soon as he is old enough, making it clear that at least two traditions are present. In most versions, he kills Laodamas, the son of Eteocles, in the battle.

Although sources differ concerning whether Alcmaeon knew about his mother&#x27;s treachery before he attacked Thebes, all agree that once he returned he killed his mother, possibly with the help of his younger brother Amphilochus.

=== Death ===
For committing matricide, he was pursued by the Erinyes and driven mad, fleeing first to Arcadia, where his grandfather Oicles ruled, and then to King Phegeus in Psophis, who purified him and gave him his daughter, Arsinoe (according to Apollodorus) or Alphesiboea (according to the geographer Pausanias), in marriage. Alcmaeon gave her the necklace and robe of Harmonia. According to Apollodorus, Alcmaeon&#x27;s presence caused the land to be infertile, so he went to Delphi for assistance. In Pausanias, it is his own madness which drove him to do so.

From there the two accounts generally agree with each other and with Thucydides. Alcmaeon is instructed by the oracle to find a land which did not exist at the time when he was polluted by killing his mother. Accordingly, he goes to a delta of the Achelous river, which was newly formed. There he marries Callirrhoe, the daughter of the river&#x27;s god. She had heard of the famous necklace and robe of Harmonia, and asks Alcmaeon to get them for her. He complies, returning to Psophis and telling king Phegeus that he required the necklace and robe in order to be purified. Either Phegeus or his sons (Agenor and Pronous) discovers the truth from a servant, and they ambush and kill Alcmaeon. In Apollodorus, Arsinoe, the daughter of Phegeus, chastises her brothers, who put her into a chest and sell her as a slave to Agapenor. Meanwhile, Callirrhoe prays to Zeus that her sons will grow up instantaneously so that they might take revenge on her husband&#x27;s murderers. Zeus grants this, and Amphoterus and Acarnan meet the sons of Phegeus at Agapenor&#x27;s house, when they are on their way to Delphi to dedicate Harmonia&#x27;s robe and necklace there. After killing them, Amphoterus and Acarnan continue to Psophis and killed king Phegeus and his queen, after which they are forced to flee to Tegea.

=== Different version from Euripides ===
Apollodorus relates a different myth about this same Alcmaeon, attributing it to Euripides. During his madness, Alcmaeon had two children with Manto: Amphilochus and Tisiphone. Alcmaeon entrusted the children to Creon, the king of Corinth, who raised them. Creon&#x27;s wife, however, became fearful that Creon might marry Tisiphone because of her great beauty, and sold the girl as a slave. Through a great coincidence, it was Alcmaeon who purchased Tisiphone and kept her as his &quot;handmaid&quot;, not knowing who she was. When he returned to Corinth to retrieve his children, her identity was somehow revealed, and Amphilocus went on to colonize Amphilochian Argos.

This story was probably the subject of Euripides&#x27; lost &quot;Alcmaeon in Corinth&quot;, which was produced posthumously. Whether the story was invented for this play is unclear.

The epic poem &quot;Alcmeonis&quot; as well as Sophocles&#x27; play &quot;Alcmaeon&quot;, and those by Achaeus, Agathon, and Astydamas, are known of, but have all been lost.
