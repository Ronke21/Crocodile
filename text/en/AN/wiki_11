<text>São Vicente (Portuguese for &quot;Saint Vincent&quot;) is one of the Barlavento Islands, the northern group within the Cape Verde archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean, off the West African coast. It is located between the islands of Santo Antão and Santa Luzia, with the Canal de São Vicente separating it from Santo Antão.

== Geography ==
The island is roughly rectangular in shape with an area of . From east to west it measures and from north to south . The island, of volcanic origin, is fairly flat. The last volcanic activity is considered to have taken place in the Pleistocene. Although very eroded, some craters still remain, for instance Viana. Its highest point is Monte Verde, located in the eastern part with an altitude of . Other mountains include Madeiral (680 m), Caixa (535 m) and Monte Cara (490 m).

92.6% of the island population lives in the urban area of Mindelo, on the Porto Grande Bay, a caldera that is breached by the ocean. A small islet, Ilhéu dos Pássaros, is less than one nautical mile off the coast of Porto Grande Bay. There are a few intermittent streams, including Ribeira do Calhau and Ribeira de Julião.

===Climate===
São Vicente has a hot desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;). The average annual temperature in Mindelo is . The island is very dry with only annual precipitation in Mindelo. Only the higher area of Monte Verde receives more precipitation.

== History ==

São Vicente was discovered by the Portuguese discoverer Diogo Afonso on 22 January 1462 (Saint Vincent&#x27;s Day). Due to its lack of water, the island was initially used only as a cattle pasture. When the Municipality of Santo Antão was established in 1732, the island of São Vicente was part of it. At that time, it did not have permanent inhabitants. In 1793 the area of Porto Grande Bay was settled. It was only in 1838, when a coal depot was established at Porto Grande Bay to supply ships on Atlantic routes, that the population started to grow rapidly. From the beginning of the 20th century the port of Mindelo lost its importance for transatlantic navigation. Causes for this were the shift from coal to oil as fuel for ships, the rise of competing ports like Dakar and the Canary Islands and the lack of investment in port infrastructure.

==Municipality==

Administratively, the island of São Vicente is covered by one municipality, &quot;Concelho de São Vicente&quot;. This municipality consists of one &quot;freguesia&quot; (civil parish), &quot;Nossa Senhora da Luz&quot;, which also covers the whole island. The municipal seat is the city of Mindelo.

The &quot;freguesia&quot; is subdivided into the following settlements:

* Baía das Gatas
* Lameirão
* Mindelo (city)
* Monte Verde
* Norte da Baía
* Ribeira da Vinha
* Ribeira de Calhau 
* Ribeira Julião
* Salamansa
* São Pedro
===Politics===

Since 2004, the Movement for Democracy (MpD) is the ruling party of the municipality. The results of the latest elections, in 2016:

===Presidents===
*Henrique Teixeira de Sousa, in the 1960s
*Onésimo Silveira, in the late-1990s and the early 2000s
*Isaura Gomes 2004–2005 and 2008–2011
*Augusto Neves (since 2011)

== Population==

In the 1830s, São Vicente had an estimated population of 356. The population of São Vicente in the 2010 census was 76,140, making it the second most populous island of Cape Verde after Santiago. The annual population growth is 1.3%. 92.6% of the population live in urban areas, which is the highest proportion of all islands (average for Cape Verde: 61.8%). Life expectancy is 76 years, higher than some other parts of the world. The birth rate is 2.7% and infant mortality rate is 18 per 1000 live births (for comparison 103 in DR Congo, 55 in India, 27 in Turkey, 23 in Brazil, 16 in Russia, 4 in Finland).

The majority of the population is young; 49% of the population is under the age of 25, and 7.4% of the population is over the age of 65. The island has 19,923 households, of which there are an average of 3.8 persons per household, lower than Cape Verde&#x27;s level of 4.2 persons per household. In 2010 15.1% of the households owned an automobile (Cape Verde: 12.7%).

== Economy ==

The economy of the island was always based almost exclusively on commerce and services. Due to lack of rain, agriculture is at a subsistence level. Fishing has some relevance, but conditions prevent it from being more important, not only for the catch—lobster—but also for the associated industries: conserves, drying and salting of fish, and naval construction.

Porto Grande is the main port of Cape Verde, through which passes much of the country&#x27;s imports. It has a terminal of containers, silos, and refrigeration units that make handling load overflow possible. There is also a modern seawater desalination plant, which provides water for public consumption and for naval shipyards.

In the industrial sector, the island presents an abundance of manpower, even though unskilled, resulting from the exodus of inhabitants of other islands to São Vicente. About 27% of the employed population is unskilled. Highly qualified employees—company executives, public administrators, and managers and directors—make up less than 2% of employees. It is distinguished, however, by a bigger participation of women in decision-making positions than the national average.

According to the 2010 census, the island of São Vicente has the largest unemployment rate of the country—14.8%—while the national average is 10.7%. Unemployment affects women more than men. The industrial park of the island—the Industrial Zone of the Lazareto—concentrates diverse types of manufacturing, essentially due to foreign investment, in the activities of footwear, confections, and fish processing.

The National Center of Workmanship of Mindelo supports local craftsmen in the production and commercialization of ceramic parts, articles made of coconut rinds, and necklaces of shells and rocks.

Many sports are practised in São Vicente, and many have spread to the remaining islands. The island is suitable for windsurfing; the beach of São Pedro is considered one of the best for windsurfing, as shown by the many world-class champions of the sport. Cycling, walking trails and horseback riding are ways to explore the island. São Vicente has an excellent 18-hole golf course. For these reasons, tourism has excellent growth potential on São Vicente and in the rest of the Cape Verde archipelago. Travel between the diverse localities of the island is provided by a system of public transportation operated by five private companies: Transcor.SA, Morabeza Transport, Transport Joy, Friendship, Sotral and Automindelo. However, especially for places farthest from the city of the Mindelo, namely Baía das Gatas, Calhau, and São Pedro, van and bus leasing are the usual forms of transportation.

== Education ==
The literacy rate is 85%, and 98.9% among Cape Verdean youth. 54% of the island&#x27;s population (those aged between 1 and 12 years old) receive education. Here are the schools and classrooms in São Vicente:
*Preschool – 25 daycares, the majority with a particular character, about 2,600 attendees between the ages of 1 and 6

*Secondary Education (7th year to 12th year) – 8,000 students in 146 classrooms with 384 professors

===Educational institutions===

<text>Dōgen Zenji (道元禅師; 26 January 1200 – 22 September 1253), was a Japanese Zen Buddhist monk, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan. He is also known as Dōgen Kigen (), Eihei Dōgen (), Kōso Jōyō Daishi (), and Busshō Dentō Kokushi ().

Originally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he was ultimately dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for four years, finally training under Tiāntóng Rújìng, an eminent teacher of the Cáodòng lineage of Chinese Chan. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) through literary works such as &quot;Fukanzazengi&quot; and &quot;Bendōwa&quot;.

He eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left Kyoto for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery Eihei-ji, which remains the head temple of the Sōtō school today.

Dōgen is known for his extensive writings like the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; (&quot;Treasury of the True Dharma Eye&quot;, considered his magnum opus), the &quot;Eihei Kōroku&quot; (&quot;Extensive Record,&quot; a collection of his talks), the &quot;Eihei Shingi&quot; (the first Japanese Zen monastic code), along with his Japanese poetry, and commentaries. Dōgen&#x27;s writings are one of the most important sources studied in the contemporary Sōtō Zen tradition.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dōgen was probably born into a noble family, though as an illegitimate child of Minamoto Michichika. His foster father was his older brother Minamoto no Michitomo, who served in the imperial court as a high-ranking . His mother, named Ishi, the daughter of Matsudono Motofusa and a sister of the monk Ryōkan Hōgen, is said to have died when Dōgen was age 7.

===Early training===
In 1212, the spring of his thirteenth year, Dōgen fled the house of his uncle Matsudono Moroie and went to his uncle Ryōkan Hōgen at the foot of Mount Hiei, the headquarters of the Tendai school of Buddhism. Stating that his mother&#x27;s death was the reason he wanted to become a monk, Ryōkan sent the young Dōgen to Jien, an abbot at Yokawa on Mount Hiei. According to the &quot;Kenzeiki&quot; (), he became possessed by a single question with regard to the Tendai doctrine:
This question was, in large part, prompted by the Tendai concept of original enlightenment ( &quot;hongaku&quot;), which states that all human beings are enlightened by nature and that, consequently, any notion of achieving enlightenment through practice is fundamentally flawed.

The &quot;Kenzeiki&quot; further states that he found no answer to his question at Mount Hiei, and that he was disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement. Therefore, Dōgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit Kōin, the Tendai abbot of Onjō-ji Temple (), asking him this same question. Kōin said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying Chán in China. In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist Myōan Eisai, Dōgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (), under Eisai&#x27;s successor, Myōzen ().

===Travel to China===
In 1223, Dōgen and Myōzen undertook the dangerous passage across the East China Sea to China (Song dynasty) to study in Jing-de-si (Ching-te-ssu, ) monastery as Eisai had once done. Around the time the Mongol Empire was waging wars on the various dynasties of China.

In China, Dōgen first went to the leading Chan monasteries in Zhèjiāng province. At the time, most Chan teachers based their training around the use of &quot;gōng-àn&quot; (Japanese: &quot;kōan&quot;). Though Dōgen assiduously studied the kōans, he became disenchanted with the heavy emphasis laid upon them, and wondered why the sutras were not studied more. At one point, owing to this disenchantment, Dōgen even refused Dharma transmission from a teacher. Then, in 1225, he decided to visit a master named Rújìng (; J. Nyojō), the thirteenth patriarch of the Cáodòng (J. Sōtō) lineage of Zen Buddhism, at Mount Tiāntóng&#x27;s ( &quot;Tiāntóngshān&quot;; J. Tendōzan) Tiāntóng temple in Níngbō. Rujing was reputed to have a style of Chan that was different from the other masters whom Dōgen had thus far encountered. In later writings, Dōgen referred to Rujing as &quot;the Old Buddha&quot;. Additionally he affectionately described both Rujing and Myōzen as .

Under Rujing, Dōgen realized liberation of body and mind upon hearing the master say, &quot;cast off body and mind&quot; ( &quot;shēn xīn tuō luò&quot;). This phrase would continue to have great importance to Dōgen throughout his life, and can be found scattered throughout his writings, as—for example—in a famous section of his &quot;Genjōkōan&quot; ():
Myōzen died shortly after Dōgen arrived at Mount Tiantong. In 1227, Dōgen received Dharma transmission and &quot;inka&quot; from Rujing, and remarked on how he had finally settled his &quot;life&#x27;s quest of the great matter&quot;.

===Return to Japan===
Dōgen returned to Japan in 1227 or 1228, going back to stay at Kennin-ji, where he had trained previously. Among his first actions upon returning was to write down the &quot;Fukanzazengi&quot; (; &quot;Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen&quot;), a short text emphasizing the importance of and giving instructions for &quot;zazen&quot; (sitting meditation).

However, tension soon arose as the Tendai community began taking steps to suppress both Zen and Jōdo Shinshū, the new forms of Buddhism in Japan. In the face of this tension, Dōgen left the Tendai dominion of Kyōto in 1230, settling instead in an abandoned temple in what is today the city of Uji, south of Kyōto.

In 1233, Dōgen founded the Kannon-dōri-in in Fukakusa as a small center of practice. He later expanded this temple into Kōshōhōrin-ji ().

===Eihei-ji===

In 1243, Hatano Yoshishige () offered to relocate Dōgen&#x27;s community to Echizen province, far to the north of Kyōto. Dōgen accepted because of the ongoing tension with the Tendai community, and the growing competition of the Rinzai-school.

His followers built a comprehensive center of practice there, calling it Daibutsu Temple (Daibutsu-ji, ). While the construction work was going on, Dōgen would live and teach at Yoshimine-dera Temple (Kippō-ji, ), which is located close to Daibutsu-ji. During his stay at Kippō-ji, Dōgen &quot;fell into a depression&quot;. It marked a turning point in his life, giving way to &quot;rigorous critique of Rinzai Zen&quot;. He criticized Dahui Zonggao, the most influential figure of Song dynasty Chán.

In 1246, Dōgen renamed Daibutsu-ji, calling it Eihei-ji. This temple remains one of the two head temples of Sōtō Zen in Japan today, the other being Sōji-ji.

Dōgen spent the remainder of his life teaching and writing at Eihei-ji. In 1247, the newly installed shōgun&#x27;s regent, Hōjō Tokiyori, invited Dōgen to come to Kamakura to teach him. Dōgen made the rather long journey east to provide the shōgun with lay ordination, and then returned to Eihei-ji in 1248. In the autumn of 1252, Dōgen fell ill, and soon showed no signs of recovering. He presented his robes to his main apprentice, Koun Ejō (), making him the abbot of Eihei-ji.

===Death===
At Hatano Yoshishige&#x27;s invitation, Dōgen left for Kyōto in search of a remedy for his illness. In 1253, soon after arriving in Kyōto, Dōgen died. Shortly before his death, he had written a death poem:

&lt;poem&gt;Fifty-four years lighting up the sky.
A quivering leap smashes a billion worlds.
Hah!
Entire body looks for nothing.
Living, I plunge into Yellow Springs.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Teachings==
===Zazen===
Dōgen often stressed the critical importance of zazen, or sitting meditation as the central practice of Buddhism. He considered zazen to be identical to studying Zen. This is pointed out clearly in the first sentence of the 1243 instruction manual &quot;Zazen-gi&quot; (; &quot;Principles of Zazen&quot;): &quot;Studying Zen ... is zazen&quot;. Dōgen taught zazen to everyone, even for the laity, male or female and including all social classes. In referring to zazen, Dōgen is most often referring specifically to &quot;shikantaza&quot;, roughly translatable as &quot;nothing but precisely sitting&quot;, or &quot;just sitting,&quot; which is a kind of sitting meditation in which the meditator sits &quot;in a state of brightly alert attention that is free of thoughts, directed to no object, and attached to no particular content&quot;. In his &quot;Fukan Zazengi&quot;, Dōgen wrote:

Dōgen also described zazen practice with the term &quot;hishiryō&quot; (, &quot;non-thinking&quot;, &quot;without thinking&quot;, &quot;beyond thinking&quot;). According to Cleary, it refers to &quot;ekō henshō&quot;, turning the light around, focussing awareness on awareness itself. It is a state of no-mind which one is simply aware of things as they are, beyond thinking and not-thinking - the active effort not to think. In the &quot;Fukanzazengi&quot;, Dōgen writes:...settle into a steady, immobile sitting position. Think of not thinking (&quot;fushiryō&quot;). How do you think of not-thinking? Without thinking (&quot;hishiryō&quot;). This in itself is the essential art of zazen. The zazen I speak of is not learning meditation. It is simply the Dharma-gate of repose and bliss, the cultivation-authentication of totally culminated enlightenment. It is the presence of things as they are.Masanobu Takahashi writes that &quot;hishiryō&quot; is not a state of no mental activity whatsoever. Instead, it is a state &quot;beyond thinking and not-thinking&quot; and beyond affirmation and rejection. Other Japanese Dogen scholars link the term with the realization of emptiness. According to Thomas Kasulis, non-thinking refers to the &quot;pure presence of things as they are&quot;, &quot;without affirming nor negating&quot;, without accepting nor rejecting, without believing nor disbelieving. In short, it is a non-conceptual, non-intentional and &quot;prereflective mode of consciousness&quot; which does not imply that it is an experience without content. Similarly, Hee-Jin Kim describes this as an &quot;objectless, subjectless, formless, goalless and purposeless&quot; state which is yet not a blank void. As such, the correct mental attitude for zazen according to Dōgen is one of effortless non-striving, this is because for Dōgen, original enlightenment is already always present.

=== Other Buddhist practices ===

While Dōgen emphasized the importance and centrality of zazen, he did not reject other traditional Buddhist practices, and his monasteries performed various traditional ritual practices. Dōgen&#x27;s monasteries also followed a strict monastic code based on the Chinese Chan codes and Dōgen often quotes these and various Vinaya texts in his works. As such, monastic rules and decorum (saho) was an important element of Dōgen&#x27;s teaching. One of the most important texts by Dōgen on this topic is the &quot;Pure Standards for the Zen Community&quot; (&quot;Eihei Shingi&quot;).

Dōgen certainly saw zazen as the most important Zen practice, and saw other practices as secondary. He frequently relegates other Buddhist practices to a lesser status, as he writes in the &quot;Bendōwa&quot;: &quot;Commitment to Zen is casting off body and mind. You have no need for incense offerings, homage praying, nembutsu, penance disciplines, or silent sutra readings; just sit single-mindedly.&quot; While Dōgen rhetorically critiques traditional practices in some passages, Foulk writes that &quot;Dōgen did not mean to reject literally any of those standard Buddhist training methods&quot;. Rather, for Dōgen, one should engage in all practices without attachment and from the point of view of the emptiness of all things. It is from this perspective that Dōgen writes we should not engage in any &quot;practice&quot; (which is merely a conventional category which separates one kind of activity from another).

Indeed, according to Foulk:the specific rituals that seem to be disavowed in the &quot;Bendowa&quot; passage are all prescribed for Zen monks, often in great detail, in Dogen&#x27;s other writings. In &quot;Kuyo shobutsu&quot;, Dogen recommends the practice of offering incense and making worshipful prostrations before Buddha images and stupas, as prescribed in the sutras and Vinaya texts. In &quot;Raihai tokuzui&quot; he urges trainees to revere enlightened teachers and to make offerings and prostrations to them, describing this as a practice which helps pave the way to one&#x27;s own awakening. In &quot;Chiji shingi&quot; he stipulates that the vegetable garden manager in a monastery should participate together with the main body of monks in sutra chanting services (fugin), recitation services (nenju) in which buddhas&#x27; names are chanted (a form of nenbutsu practice), and other major ceremonies, and that he should burn incense and make prostrations (shoko raihai) and recite the buddhas&#x27; names in prayer morning and evening when at work in the garden. The practice of repentences (sange) is encouraged in Dogen&#x27;s &quot;Kesa kudoku&quot;, in his &quot;Sanji go&quot;, and his &quot;Keisei sanshiki&quot;. Finally, in &quot;Kankin&quot;, Dogen gives detailed directions for sutra reading services (kankin) in which, as he explains, texts could be read either silently or aloud as a means of producing merit to be dedicated to any number of ends, including the satisfaction of wishes made by lay donors, or prayers on behalf of the emperor. 

===Oneness of practice-verification===
The primary concept underlying Dōgen&#x27;s Zen practice is &quot;the oneness of practice-verification&quot; or &quot;the unity of cultivation and confirmation&quot; ( &quot;shushō-ittō&quot; / &quot;shushō-ichinyo&quot;). The term &quot;shō&quot; (, verification, affirmation, confirmation, attainment) is also sometimes translated as &quot;enlightenment&quot;, though this translation is also questioned by some scholars.

The &quot;shushō-ittō&quot; teaching was first and most famously explained in the &quot;Bendōwa&quot; ( &quot;A Talk on the Endeavor of the Path&quot;, c. 1231) as follows:

In the &quot;Fukanzazengi&quot; (&quot;Universal Recommendation for Zazen&quot;), Dōgen explains how to practice zazen and then explains the nature of verification If you grasp the point of this [practice], the four elements [of the body] will become light and at ease, the spirit will be fresh and sharp, thoughts will be correct and clear; the flavor of the dharma will sustain the spirit, and you will be calm, pure, and joyful. Your daily life will be [the expression of] your true natural state. Once you achieve clarification [of the truth], you may be likened to the dragon gaining the water or the tiger taking to the mountains. You should realize that when right thought is present, dullness and agitation cannot intrude. 

===Buddha-nature===
For Dōgen, buddha-nature or &quot;busshō&quot; () is all of reality, &quot;all things&quot; (). In the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;, Dōgen writes that &quot;whole-being is the Buddha-nature&quot; and that even inanimate objects (rocks, sand, water) are an expression of Buddha-nature. He rejected any view that saw buddha-nature as a permanent, substantial inner self or ground. Dōgen describes buddha-nature as &quot;vast emptiness&quot;, &quot;the world of becoming&quot; and writes that &quot;impermanence is in itself Buddha-nature&quot;. According to Dōgen:

Therefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.Takashi James Kodera writes that the main source of Dōgen&#x27;s understanding of buddha-nature is a passage from the &quot;Nirvana sutra&quot; which was widely understood as stating that all sentient beings possess buddha-nature. However, Dōgen interpreted the passage differently, rendering it as follows: All are () sentient beings, () all things are () the Buddha-nature (); the Tathagata () abides constantly (), is non-existent () yet existent (), and is change (). Kodera explains that &quot;whereas in the conventional reading the Buddha-nature is understood as a permanent essence inherent in all sentient beings, Dōgen contends that all things are the Buddha-nature. In the former reading, the Buddha-nature is a change less potential, but in the latter, it is the eternally arising and perishing actuality of all things in the world.&quot;

Thus for Dōgen buddha-nature includes everything, the totality of &quot;all things&quot;, including inanimate objects like grass, trees and land (which are also &quot;mind&quot; for Dōgen).

=== Great realization / satori ===
Dōgen taught that through zazen one could attain &quot;great realization&quot; or &quot;great enlightenment&quot; ( &quot;daigo-tettei&quot;), which is also called satori (, &quot;understanding&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;).

According to Ko&#x27;un Yamada, Dōgen &quot;repeatedly emphasizes the importance of each person attaining enlightenment&quot;. Dōgen writes about this in a fascicle of the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; titled &quot;Daigo&quot;, which states that when practitioners of Zen attain daigo they have risen above the discrimination between delusion and enlightenment.

While Dōgen did teach the importance of attaining enlightenment, he also critiqued certain ways of explaining it and teaching about it. According to Barbara O&#x27;Brien, Dōgen critiqued the term &quot;kenshō&quot; because &quot;the word &quot;kenshō&quot; means &#x27;to see one&#x27;s nature&#x27;, which sets up a dichotomy between the seer and the object of seeing.&quot; Furthermore, according to Bielefeldt, Dōgen&#x27;s zazen is &quot;a subtle state beyond either thinking or not thinking&quot; in which &quot;body and mind have been sloughed off&quot;. It is a state in which &quot;all striving for religious experience, all expectation of satori (daigo), is left behind.&quot; As such, while Dōgen did not reject the importance of satori, he taught that we should not sit zazen with the goal of satori in mind.

===Time-Being===
Dōgen&#x27;s conception of Being-Time or Time-Being (&quot;Uji&quot;, ) is an essential element of his metaphysics in the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;. According to the traditional interpretation, &quot;Uji&quot; here means time itself is being, and all being is time.&quot; &quot;Uji&quot; is all the changing and dynamic activities that exist as the flow of becoming, all beings in the entire world are time. The two terms are thus spoken of concurrently to emphasize that the things are not to be viewed as separate concepts. Moreover, the aim is to not abstract time and being as rational concepts. This view has been developed by scholars such as Steven Heine, Joan Stambaugh and others and has served as a motivation to compare Dōgen&#x27;s work to that of Martin Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;Dasein&quot;. Rein Raud has argued that this view is not correct and that Dōgen asserts that all existence is momentary, showing that such a reading would make quite a few of the rather cryptic passages in the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; quite lucid.

===Perfect expression===
Another essential element of Dōgen&#x27;s &#x27;performative&#x27; metaphysics is his conception of Perfect expression (&quot;Dōtoku&quot;, ). &quot;While a radically critical view on language as soteriologically inefficient, if not positively harmful, is what Zen Buddhism is famous for,&quot; it can be argued &quot;&#x27;within the framework of a rational theory of language, against an obscurantist interpretation of Zen that time and again invokes experience.&#x27;&quot; Dōgen distinguishes two types of language: monji , the first, – after Ernst Cassirer – &quot;discursive type that constantly structures our experiences and—more fundamentally—in fact produces the world we experience in the first place&quot;; and dōtoku , the second, &quot;presentative type, which takes a holistic stance and establishes the totality of significations through a texture of relations.&quot;. As Döll points out, &quot;It is this second type, as Müller holds, that allows for a positive view of language even from the radically skeptical perspective of Dōgen’s brand of Zen Buddhism.&quot;

===Critique of Rinzai===
Dōgen was sometimes critical of the Rinzai school for their formulaic and intellectual koan practice (such as the practice of the &quot;Shiryoken&quot; or &quot;Four Discernments&quot;) as well as for their disregard for the sutras:

Recently in the great Sung dynasty of China there are many who call themselves &quot;Zen masters&quot;. They do not know the length and breadth of the Buddha-Dharma. They have heard and seen but little. They memorize two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men and think this is the whole way of the Buddha-Dharma. If the Dharma of the Buddha could be condensed in two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men, it would not have been transmitted to the present day. One can hardly say that Lin Chi and Yun Men are the Venerable ones of the Buddha-Dharma.

Dōgen was also very critical of the Japanese Daruma school of Dainichi Nōnin.

===Virtues===
Dogen&#x27;s perspective of virtue is discussed in the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; text as something to be practiced inwardly so that it will manifest itself on the outside. In other words, virtue is something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions.

==Writings==
While it was customary for Buddhist works to be written in Chinese, Dōgen often wrote in Japanese, conveying the essence of his thought in a style that was at once concise, compelling, and inspiring. A master stylist, Dōgen is noted not only for his prose, but also for his poetry (in Japanese &quot;waka&quot; style and various Chinese styles). Dōgen&#x27;s use of language is unconventional by any measure. According to Dōgen scholar Steven Heine: &quot;Dogen&#x27;s poetic and philosophical works are characterized by a continual effort to express the inexpressible by perfecting imperfectable speech through the creative use of wordplay, neologism, and lyricism, as well as the recasting of traditional expressions&quot;.

===Shōbōgenzō===
Dōgen&#x27;s masterpiece is the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; (, &quot;Treasury of the True Dharma Eye&quot;), talks and writings collected together in ninety-five fascicles. The topics range from zazen, koans, Buddhist philosophy, monastic practice, the equality of women and men, to the philosophy of language, being, and time.

==== Shushō-gi ====
The &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; served as the basis for the short work entitled &quot;Shushō-gi&quot; (), which was compiled in 1890 by a layman named Ouchi Seiran (1845–1918) along with Takiya Takushū () of Eihei-ji and Azegami Baisen () of Sōji-ji. The compilation serves as an introductory compilation of key extracts from the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; which help explain the foundational teachings and concepts of Dōgen Zen to a lay audience.

===Shinji Shōbōgenzō===
Dōgen also compiled a collection of 301 koans in Chinese without commentaries added. Often called the &quot;Shinji Shōbōgenzō&quot; (&quot;shinji&quot;: &quot;original or true characters&quot; and &quot;shōbōgenzō&quot;, variously translated as &quot;the right-dharma-eye treasury&quot; or &quot;Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma&quot;). The collection is also known as the &quot;Shōbōgenzō Sanbyakusoku&quot; (The Three Hundred Verse Shōbōgenzō&quot;) and the &quot;Mana Shōbōgenzō&quot;, where &quot;mana&quot; is an alternative reading of &quot;shinji&quot;. The exact date the book was written is in dispute but Nishijima believes that Dogen may well have begun compiling the koan collection before his trip to China.

Although these stories are commonly referred to as &quot;kōans&quot;, Dōgen referred to them as &quot;kosoku&quot; (ancestral criteria) or &quot;innen&quot; (circumstances and causes or results, of a story). The word &quot;kōan&quot; for Dogen meant &quot;absolute reality&quot; or the &quot;universal Dharma&quot;.

===Collections of dharma discourses===
Lectures that Dōgen gave to his monks at his monastery, Eihei-ji, were compiled under the title &quot;Eihei Kōroku&quot;, also known as &quot;Dōgen Oshō Kōroku&quot; (The Extensive Record of Teacher Dōgen&#x27;s Sayings) in ten volumes. The sermons, lectures, sayings and poetry were compiled shortly after Dōgen&#x27;s death by his main disciples, Koun Ejō (, 1198–1280), Senne, and Gien. There are three different editions of this text: the Rinnō-ji text from 1598, a popular version printed in 1672, and a version discovered at Eihei-ji in 1937, which, although undated, is believed to be the oldest extant version.

Another collection of his talks is the &quot;Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki&quot; (Gleanings from Master Dōgen&#x27;s Sayings) in six volumes. These are talks that Dōgen gave to his leading disciple, Ejō, who became Dōgen&#x27;s disciple in 1234. The talks were recorded and edited by Ejō.

===Other writings===
Other notable writings of Dōgen are: 
* &quot;Fukanzazengi&quot; (, General Advice on the Principles of Zazen), one volume; probably written immediately after Dōgen&#x27;s return from China in 1227.
* &quot;Bendōwa&quot; (, &quot;On the Endeavor of the Way&quot;), written in 1231. This represents one of Dōgen&#x27;s earliest writings and asserts the superiority of the practice of shikantaza through a series of questions and answers. 
* &quot;Eihei shoso gakudō-yōjinshū&quot; (Advice on Studying the Way), one volume; probably written in 1234.
* &quot;Tenzo kyōkun&quot; (Instructions to the Chief Cook), one volume; written in 1237.
* &quot;Bendōhō&quot; (Rules for the Practice of the Way), one volume; written between 1244 and 1246.
* The earliest work by Dōgen is the &quot;Hōkojōki&quot; (Memoirs of the Hōkyō Period). This one volume work is a collection of questions and answers between Dōgen and his Chinese teacher, Tiāntóng Rújìng (; Japanese: Tendō Nyojō, 1162–1228). The work was discovered among Dōgen&#x27;s papers by Ejō in 1253, just three months after Dōgen&#x27;s death.

==Lineage==

Though Dogen emphasised the importance of the correct transmission of the Buddha dharma, as guaranteed by the line of transmission from Shakyamuni, his own transmission became problematic in the third generation. In 1267 Ejō retired as Abbot of Eihei-ji, giving way to Gikai, who was already favored by Dōgen. Gikai introduced esoteric elements into the practice. Opposition arose, and in 1272 Ejō resumed the position of abbot. Following Ejō&#x27;s death in 1280, Gikai became abbot again, strengthened by the support of the military for magical practices. Opposition arose again, and Gikai was forced to leave Eihei-ji. He was succeeded by Gien, who was first trained in the Daruma-school of Nōnin. His supporters designated him as the third abbot, rejecting the legitimacy of Gien.

* Koun Ejō, commentator on the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;, and former Darumashū elder
** Giin, through Ejō
** Gikai, through Ejō
*** Keizan
** Gien, through Ejō
* Senne, another commentator of the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;.

Jakuen, a student of Rujing, who traced his lineage &quot;directly back the Zen of the Song period&quot;, established Hōkyō-ji, where a strict style of Zen was practised. Students of his played a role in the conflict between Giin and Gikai.

A notable successor of Dogen was Keizan (; 1268–1325), founder of Sōji-ji Temple and author of the &quot;Record of the Transmission of Light&quot; ( &quot;Denkōroku&quot;), which traces the succession of Zen masters from Siddhārtha Gautama up to Keizan&#x27;s own day. Together, Dōgen and Keizan are regarded as the founders of the Sōtō school in Japan.

==Miraculous events and auspicious signs==
Several &quot;miraculous experiences&quot; and &quot;auspicious signs&quot; have been recorded in Dōgen&#x27;s life, some of them quite famous. According to Bodiford, &quot;Monks and laymen recorded these events as testaments to his great mystical power,&quot; which &quot;helped confirm the legacy of Dōgen&#x27;s teachings against competing claims made by members of the Buddhist establishment and other outcast groups.&quot; Bodiford further notes that the &quot;magical events at Eiheiji helped identify the temple as a cultic center,&quot; putting it at a par with other temples where supernatural events occurred. According to Faure, for Dōgen these auspicious signs were proof that &quot;Eiheiji was the only place in Japan where the Buddhist Dharma was transmitted correctly and that this monastery was thus rivaled by no other.&quot;

In Menzan Zuihō&#x27;s well-known 1753 edition of Dōgen&#x27;s biography, it records that while traveling in China with his companion Dōshō, Dōgen became very ill, and a deity appeared before him who gave him medicine which instantly healed him:

This medicine, which later became known as Gedokuen or &quot;Poison-Dispelling Pill&quot; was then produced by the Sōtō church until the Meiji Era, and was commonly sold nationwide as an herbal medicine, and became a source of income for the Sōtō church.
Another famous incident happened when he was returning to Japan from China. The ship he was on was caught in a storm. In this instance, the storm became so severe, that the crew feared the ship would sink and kill them all. Dōgen then began leading the crew in recitation of chants to Kannon (Avalokiteshwara), during which, the Bodhisattva appeared before him, and several of the crew saw her as well. After the vision appeared, the storm began to calm down, and consensus of those aboard was that they had been saved due to the intervention of Bodhisattva Avalokiteshwara. This story is repeated in official works sponsored by the Sōtō Shū Head Office and there is even a sculpture of the event in a water treatment pond in Eihei-ji Temple. Additionally, there is a 14th-century copy of a painting of the same Kannon, that was supposedly commissioned by Dōgen, that includes a piece of calligraphy that is possibly an original in Dōgen&#x27;s own hand, recording his gratitude to Avalokiteshwara:

Another miraculous event occurred, while Dōgen was at Eihei-ji. During a ceremony of gratitude for the 16 Celestial Arahants (called Rakan in Japanese), a vision of 16 Arahants appeared before Dōgen descending upon a multi-colored cloud, and the statues of the Arahants that were present at the event began to emanate rays of light, to which Dōgen then exclaimed:

Dōgen was profoundly moved by the entire experience, and took it as an auspicious sign that the offerings of the ceremony had been accepted. In his writings he wrote:

Dōgen is also recorded to have had multiple encounters with non-human beings. Aside from his encounter with the kami Inari in China, in the Denkōrou it is recorded that while at Kōshō-ji, he was also visited by a deva who came to observe during certain ceremonies, as well as a dragon who visited him at Eihei-Ji and requested to be given the eight abstinence Precepts:

<text>James Shooter (born September 27, 1951) is an American writer, editor and publisher for various comic books. He started professionally in the medium at the age of 14, and is known for his successful and controversial run as Marvel Comics&#x27; ninth editor-in-chief, and his work as editor in chief of Valiant Comics.

== Early life ==
Jim Shooter was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to parents Ken and Eleanor &quot;Ellie&quot; Shooter, who are of Polish descent. Shooter read comics as a child, though he stopped when he was about eight years old. His interest in the medium was rekindled in 1963, at the age of twelve, while he recovered in a hospital after undergoing minor surgery. He was impressed with the style of Marvel Comics, which had only begun publication two years earlier. Thinking that if he learned to write the types of stories that Marvel published, he would be an asset to DC Comics – whose books, Shooter felt, &quot;needed the help&quot; – Shooter spent about a year reading and studying comics from both companies.

== Career ==
=== DC Comics ===

At age 13, in mid-1965, Shooter wrote and drew stories featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes, and sent them in to DC Comics. On February 10, 1966, he received a phone call from Mort Weisinger, who wanted to purchase the stories Shooter had sent, and commissioned Shooter to write Supergirl and Superman stories. Weisinger eventually offered Shooter a regular position on &quot;Legion&quot;, and wanted Shooter to come to New York to spend a couple of days in his office. Shooter, who was 14 and lived in Pittsburgh, had to wait until school was in recess, after which he went to New York with his mother, spurred in part by the need to support his financially struggling parents.

According to Shooter, his father earned little as a steelworker, and Shooter saw comic-book writing as a means of helping economically. Shooter reflected in a 2010 interview:

At 14, Shooter began selling stories to DC Comics, writing for both &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, beginning with &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; No. 346 (July 1966), and providing pencil breakdowns as well. With considerable study of the writing style of DC Comics and of the recently rising Marvel Comics, Shooter created several characters for the Legion of Super-Heroes that benefited by him being one of the few writers at DC to understand the competitor&#x27;s successful character-based narrative approach. This included Legionnaires Karate Kid, Ferro Lad, and Princess Projectra, as well as the villainous group known as the Fatal Five. He also created the Superman villain the Parasite in &quot;Action Comics&quot; No. 340 (Aug. 1966). Shooter and artist Curt Swan devised the first race between the Flash and Superman, two characters known for their superhuman speed, in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Race with the Flash!&quot; in &quot;Superman&quot; #199 (Aug. 1967). Shooter wrote the first issue of &quot;Captain Action&quot; (Oct.-Nov. 1968), which was DC&#x27;s first toy tie-in.

In 1969 Shooter was accepted into New York University, but after graduating from high school he successfully applied for a job at Marvel Comics. Unable to pursue both his studies and work for Marvel, he decided against going to New York University and quit working for DC as well. While at Marvel he worked as an editor and occasional co-plotter, taking his residence at the YMCA, but after only three weeks his financial situation compelled him to give up the post and return home to Pittsburgh.

After leaving Marvel, Shooter took up work in advertising concepts, writing, and illustration for several years, supporting himself through several menial jobs during periods when advertising work was unavailable. An interview for a &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; fanzine led to his again applying to both Marvel and DC. Though both companies offered him work, Shooter opted to return to DC because they had offered him more prestigious assignments: &quot;Superman&quot; and a chance to again write the Legion of Super-Heroes, now in their own book, &quot;Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;. However, Shooter&#x27;s relationships with both &quot;Superman&quot; editor Julius Schwartz and &quot;Legion&quot; editor Murray Boltinoff were unpleasant, and he claims that both forced him to do unnecessary rewrites. In December 1975, Marvel editor-in-chief Marv Wolfman called to offer him an editorial position.

=== Marvel Comics ===

In the mid-1970s, Marvel Comics was undergoing a series of changes in the position of editor-in-chief. After Roy Thomas stepped down from the post to focus on writing, a succession of other editors, including Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, Gerry Conway, and Archie Goodwin, took the job during a relatively short span of time, only to find the task too daunting as Marvel continued to grow and add new titles and a larger staff to turn out material. On January 2, 1976, Shooter joined the Marvel staff as an assistant editor and writer.

With the quick turnover at the top, Shooter rapidly found himself rising in the ranks, and on the first working day of January 1978, he succeeded Archie Goodwin to become Marvel&#x27;s ninth editor-in-chief. During this period, publisher Stan Lee relocated to Los Angeles to better oversee Marvel&#x27;s animation, television and film projects, leaving Shooter largely in charge of the creative decision-making at Marvel&#x27;s New York City headquarters. Although there were complaints among some that Shooter imposed a dictatorial style on the &quot;Bullpen&quot;, he cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, successfully managed to keep the line of books on schedule (ending the widespread practice of missed deadlines popularly known as &quot;the Dreaded Deadline Doom&quot;), added new titles, and developed new talent. Shooter in his nine-year tenure as editor-in-chief oversaw Chris Claremont and John Byrne&#x27;s run on the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, Byrne&#x27;s work on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, Frank Miller&#x27;s series of &quot;Daredevil&quot; stories, Walt Simonson&#x27;s crafting of Norse mythology with the Marvel Universe in &quot;Thor&quot;, and Roger Stern&#x27;s runs on both &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;.

In 1981, Shooter brought Marvel into the lucrative comic book specialty shop market with &quot;Dazzler&quot; #1. Featuring a disco-themed heroine with ties to the X-Men (based upon an unmade film set to star Bo Derek), the first issue of this series was sold only through specialty stores, bypassing the then-standard newsstand/spinner rack distribution route altogether, as recognition by Marvel of the growing comics shop sector. Subsequent issues of &quot;Dazzler&quot;, however, were sold through newsstand [returnable] accounts as well. &quot;Dazzler&quot; was the first direct sales-only ongoing series from a major publisher; other Marvel titles, such as &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; and &quot;Ka-Zar&quot;, soon followed. Later that same year, Shooter wrote &quot;Marvel Treasury Edition&quot; No. 28 which featured the second Superman and Spider-Man intercompany crossover. Additionally in 1981, Shooter was recognized as one of six &quot;New Yorkers of the Year&quot; by the New York chapter of the JayCees, for his &quot;contributions toward revitalizing the comics industry and helping Marvel Comics achieve a new pinnacle of success.&quot; Shooter also institutionalized creator royalties, starting the Epic imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover events, with &quot;Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions&quot; and &quot;Secret Wars&quot;; and launched a new, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, line named &quot;New Universe&quot;, to commemorate Marvel&#x27;s 25th anniversary, in 1986.

Despite his success in revitalizing Marvel, Shooter angered and alienated a number of long-time Marvel creators by insisting on strong editorial control and strict adherence to deadlines. Although he instituted an art-return program, and implemented a policy giving creators royalties when their books passed certain sales benchmarks or when characters they worked on were licensed as toys, Shooter occasionally found himself in well-publicized conflicts with some writers and artists. Creators such as Steve Gerber, Marv Wolfman, Gene Colan, John Byrne, and Doug Moench left to work for DC (Encouraged by its new publisher, Jenette Kahn, aggressively taking advantage of the opportunity) or other companies.

During Shooter&#x27;s tenure, he enforced a policy forbidding the portrayal of gay characters in the Marvel universe. According to John Byrne, he initially had to conceal Northstar&#x27;s sexuality, since Shooter personally told him that portraying a gay character would not be allowed. Marvel nonetheless published the first gay-themed story by a mainstream comics publisher during this time, written by Shooter himself; in it, two gay men attempt to rape Bruce Banner. Comics historian Frederick Luis Aldama says that Marvel under Shooter&#x27;s tenure &quot;was widely considered homophobic.&quot;

Roy Thomas, who left Marvel following a contract dispute with Shooter, reflected in 2005 on Shooter&#x27;s editorial policies:

John Romita Sr. said:
John Byrne said similarly:
Shooter was fired from Marvel on April 15, 1987.

=== Valiant Comics ===

Shooter and his investors then founded a new company, Voyager Communications, which published comics under the Valiant Comics banner, entering the market in 1989 with comics based on Nintendo and WWF licensed characters. Two years later Valiant entered the superhero market with a relaunch of the Gold Key Comics character Magnus, Robot Fighter. Another Gold Key character, Solar, Man of the Atom was also relaunched later in the same year. Shooter brought many of Marvel&#x27;s creators to Valiant, including Bob Layton and Barry Windsor-Smith, as well as industry veterans such as Don Perlin. Valiant also established &quot;knob row&quot;, in which creators were taught how to render the company&#x27;s comics in the Valiant style.

Occasionally over the years, Shooter was required to fill in as penciller on various books he wrote or oversaw as editor. During his period as Valiant&#x27;s publisher, money and talent were often at a premium, and Shooter was sporadically forced to pencil a story. To conceal this fact, he drew under the pseudonym of Paul Creddick, the name of his brother-in-law.

=== Defiant and Broadway Comics ===
After being ousted from Valiant in 1992, Shooter and several of his co-workers went on to found Defiant Comics in early 1993. Despite some initial success with the first title, the new company failed to secure an audience in the increasingly crowded direct sales market and went out of business after thirteen months of publishing.

In 1995, Shooter founded Broadway Comics, which was an offshoot of Broadway Video, the production company that produces &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, but this line ended after its parent sold the properties to Golden Books. In 1998, he spoke of a planned self-publishing, Daring Comics, with a projected eight titles including &quot;Anomalies&quot; and &quot;Rathh of God&quot;, with artist Joe James scheduled to draw at least one.

Shooter returned to Valiant, by now called Acclaim Comics, briefly in 1999 to write &quot;Unity 2000&quot; (an attempt to combine and revitalize the older and newer Valiant Universes) but Acclaim went out of business after the completion of only three of the planned six issues.

=== 2000s–present ===
In 2003, Jim Shooter joined custom comics company Illustrated Media as creative director and editor in chief.

In 2005, former Marvel Comics letterer Denise Wohl approached Shooter to create &quot;Seven&quot;, a series based on the Kabbalah. Writer Shooter created a team of seven characters, one from each continent, who are brought together in New York because they share a higher consciousness. The project, which was to be self-published by Wohl, was announced at the 2007 New York Comic Con, to debut in July of that year, and was projected to &quot;evolve into television and film projects, video games, blogs, interactive Q&amp;A, animation, trading cards, apparel, accessories, [and] school supplies.&quot; Wohl was to donate a portion of her proceeds to the &quot;Spirituality for Kids Foundation.&quot; Only the first issue of the series has been published.

In September 2007, DC Comics announced that Shooter would be the new writer of the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 5 series, beginning with issue #37. Shooter&#x27;s return to the &quot;Legion&quot;, a little over 30 years from his previous run, was his first major published comic book work in years. Shooter co-created the new Legionnaire Gazelle with artist Francis Manapul while on the title. His run on the series ended with issue No. 49, one issue before the book was canceled.

Shooter was hired by Valiant Entertainment, a company that bought Valiant&#x27;s intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction of Acclaim Entertainment, to write from the end of 2008 into the summer of 2009.

In July 2009 Dark Horse Comics announced at San Diego Comic-Con that Shooter would oversee the publication of new series based on Gold Key Comics characters from the Silver Age of Comic Books, such as Turok, Doctor Solar, and Magnus: Robot Fighter, and write some of them as well. Valiant sued Shooter over his moving to write the Gold Key characters for Dark Horse as they expected to get the rights and that he interfered with their ability to license the Key characters by indicating that he would write them for Dark Horse. As of January 2010, Valiant had given up the lawsuit against Shooter. He subsequently wrote the relaunched &quot;Magnus: Robotfighter&quot;, &quot;Turok&quot; and &quot;Dr. Solar&quot; series as well as &quot;Mighty Samson&quot;, another Gold Key character (that had not been picked up by Valiant Comics), for Dark Horse, beginning in 2010.

As of 2023, Shooter still works as consulting editor and freelance writer for custom comics company Illustrated Media.

<text>Max Allan Collins (born March 3, 1948) is an American mystery writer, noted for his graphic novels. His work has been published in several formats and his &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; series was the basis for a film of the same name. He wrote the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; newspaper strip for many years and has produced numerous novels featuring the character as well.

==Biography==
===Writing career===
Collins has written novels, screenplays, comic books, comic strips, trading cards, short stories, movie novelizations and historical fiction. He wrote the graphic novel &quot;Road to Perdition&quot; (which was developed into a film in 2002), created the comic book private eye &quot;Ms. Tree&quot;, and took over writing the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip from creator Chester Gould. Collins briefly wrote the &quot;Batman&quot; comic book in 1987 and crafted a new origin for the Jason Todd character. Collins and artist Terry Beatty created Wild Dog at DC that same year in a self-titled limited series. The character later appeared as a feature in the &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; anthology. As of 2016, Wild Dog became a recurring character in the &quot;Arrow&quot; television series and is portrayed by actor Rick Gonzalez.

Another Collins contribution to the Batman franchise was scripting the English-language translation of &quot;&quot; in 2003. He wrote books to expand on the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; TV series. He has written books and comics based on the TV series franchise &quot;CSI&quot;. In 2006 he wrote &quot;Buried Deep&quot; (also released as &quot;Bones Buried Deep&quot;), based on the TV series &quot;Bones&quot;.

He has written two sequel novels to &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;: &quot;Road to Purgatory&quot; and &quot;Road to Paradise&quot;. He wrote three more graphic novels starring the characters from &quot;Road to Perdition&quot;. These graphic novels, called collectively &quot;On the Road to Perdition&quot;, form the basis of the film.

He co-founded the International Association of Media Tie-in Writers with Lee Goldberg. The IAMTW is an organization for writers of tie-ins and novelizations.

Collins studied in the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa.

Collins is a fan of the mystery writer Mickey Spillane from childhood and later became close friends with him. The two collaborated on a comic book series in the 1990s called &quot;Mike Danger&quot;. Upon Spillane&#x27;s death in 2006, Collins was entrusted to finish various uncompleted works by Spillane including &quot;Dead Street&quot;, &quot;The Big Showdown&quot;, and an ongoing series of Mike Hammer novel completions, beginning with &quot;The Goliath Bone&quot; in 2008. To date, Collins has completed thirteen Spillane Hammer novels, with the most recent being &quot;Kill Me If You Can&quot;, published in 2022.

In 2021, he and Canadian actor/writer Dave Thomas teamed to write the sci-fi mystery novel &quot;The Many Lives of Jimmy Leighton&quot;. 

===Movies and music===
In addition to his work as a writer, Collins has written and directed four movies: &quot;Mommy&quot;, &quot;Mommy 2: Mommy&#x27;s Day&quot;, &quot;Real Time: Siege at Lucas Street Market&quot;, and &quot;Eliot Ness: An Untouchable Life&quot; (based on his Edgar Award–nominated play). All four were produced independently on location in Collins&#x27; hometown of Muscatine, Iowa. The first three are available on DVD—separately or in the &quot;Black Box&quot; set—from Troma Team Video, and the Ness film is distributed by VCI Entertainment. The DVD release of &quot;Real Time: Siege at Lucas Street Market&quot; being notable for being one of the first films to take advantage of the multi-angle feature on DVD players, thus giving viewers the opportunity to watch the story unfold from different viewpoints.

Collins has written and performed music with his rock band, Crusin&#x27;.

==Political views==
Collins is a Democrat, describing his political views thus: &quot;I think of myself as slightly left of center, but my father thought of himself as slightly right of center, when he was slightly right of Genghis Khan. So who knows? I do know that I veer left when the right is getting out of hand, which they frequently do.&quot;

==Personal life==
Collins and his wife, Barbara, have a son, Nathan.

In 2008, the band he started in 1966 in Muscatine, Iowa—the Daybreakers—was inducted into the Iowa Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame. Ten years later, in 2018, Collins was again inducted into the Iowa Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the band Cruisin&#x27;.

==Awards==
Collins received an Inkpot Award in 1982. He won the Shamus Award in 1984 and 1992.

This series features a former U.S. Marine sniper turned professional assassin after returning from the Vietnam War in 1973. The books are narrated in first person by Quarry (a code name). He maintains his own code of honor, and rationalizes his crimes by taking contracts to kill people who he believes brought about their own demise and will eventually be murdered by one enemy or another (e.g., corrupt politicians, mobsters, exploitative businessmen, drug traffickers).

<text>Beverly Hills is a city located in Los Angeles County, California, United States. A notable and historic suburb of Los Angeles, it is located just southwest of the Hollywood Hills, approximately northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Beverly Hills&#x27; land area totals and (together with the neighboring smaller city of West Hollywood to the east) is entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles. According to the 2020 census, the city has a population of 32,701, marking a decrease of 1,408 from the 2010 census count of 34,109.

In American popular culture, Beverly Hills has been known as an affluent location within Greater Los Angeles, which corresponds to higher property values and taxes in the area. The city is well known for its Rodeo Drive shopping district that includes many designer brands. Throughout its history, the city has been home to many celebrities. It is noted for numerous hotels and resorts, including the Beverly Hilton and the Beverly Hills Hotel. The city has been featured in many movies, television series, music, and media, in the United States and internationally.

After its initial settlement in 1828, Beverly Hills was originally a primarily agricultural community centered around Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas, a Mexican era rancho grant. Beverly Hills was first incorporated as a city in September 1914 by a group of investors who had failed to find oil but found water instead and eventually decided to develop it into a town.

==History==
===Early history===

Gaspar de Portolá arrived in the area that would later become Beverly Hills on August 3, 1769, traveling along native trails which followed the present-day route of Wilshire Boulevard. The area was settled by Californio ranchera María Rita Quinteros de Valdez and her husband in 1828. They called their of property the &quot;Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas&quot;. In 1854, she sold the ranch to Benjamin Davis Wilson (1811–1878) and Henry Hancock (1822–1883). By the 1880s, the ranch had been subdivided into parcels of and was being rapidly bought up by Anglos from Los Angeles and the East coast.

Henry Hammel and Andrew H. Denker acquired most of it and used it for farming lima beans. At this point, the area was known as the Hammel and Denker Ranch. By 1888, they were planning to build a town called Morocco on their holdings.

===20th century===

In 1900, Burton E. Green, Charles A. Canfield, Max Whittier, Frank H. Buck, Henry E. Huntington, William G. Kerckhoff, William F. Herrin, W.S. Porter, and Frank H. Balch formed the Amalgamated Oil Company, bought the Hammel and Denker ranch, and began looking for oil. They did not find enough to exploit commercially by the standards of the time, though. In 1906, therefore, they reorganized as the Rodeo Land and Water Company, renamed the property &quot;Beverly Hills&quot;, subdivided it, and began selling lots. The development was named &quot;Beverly Hills&quot; after Beverly Farms in Beverly, Massachusetts, and because of the hills in the area.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on September 2, 1906: 
Percy H. Clark Company are managing the development of the foothill portion of the Hammel &amp; Denker ranch for the Rodeo Land and Water Company (the Canfield-Huntington-Kerckhoff syndicate), to be known as Beverly Hills. No expense is being spared to make this a fine suburban district. . . . The property has been laid out on beautiful curved lines.

The first house in the subdivision was built in 1907, but sales remained slow.

====Restrictive covenants====
Beverly Hills was one of many all-white planned communities started in the Los Angeles area around this time. Restrictive covenants prohibited non-whites from owning or renting property, unless they were employed as servants by white residents. It was also forbidden to sell or rent property to Jews in Beverly Hills.

====Incorporation====
Burton Green began construction on The Beverly Hills Hotel in 1911. The hotel was finished in 1912. The visitors drawn by the hotel were inclined to purchase land in Beverly Hills, and by 1914 the population had grown enough to qualify for incorporation as an independent city. That same year, the Rodeo Land and Water Company decided to separate its water business from its real estate business. The Beverly Hills Utility Commission was split off from the land company and incorporated in September 1914, buying all of the utilities-related assets from the Rodeo Land and Water Company.

In 1919, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford bought land on Summit Drive and built a mansion, finished in 1921 and nicknamed &quot;Pickfair&quot; by the press. The glamour associated with Fairbanks and Pickford as well as other movie stars who built mansions in the city contributed to its growing appeal.

====Water supply====
By the early 1920s, the population of Beverly Hills had grown enough to make the water supply a political issue. In 1923, the usual solution, annexation to the city of Los Angeles, was proposed. There was considerable opposition to annexation among such famous residents as Pickford, Fairbanks, Will Rogers and Rudolph Valentino. The Beverly Hills Utility Commission, opposed to annexation as well, managed to force the city into a special election and the plan was defeated 337 to 507.

In 1928, the Beverly Wilshire Apartment Hotel (now the Beverly Wilshire Hotel) opened on Wilshire Boulevard between El Camino and Rodeo drives, part of the old Beverly Hills Speedway. That same year, oilman Edward L. Doheny finished construction of Greystone Mansion, a 55-room mansion meant as a wedding present for his son Edward L. Doheny Jr. The house is now owned by the city of Beverly Hills and is a designated historical landmark.

In the early 1930s, Santa Monica Park was renamed Beverly Gardens and was extended to span the entire two-mile (3-kilometer) length of Santa Monica Boulevard through the city. The Electric Fountain marks the corner of Santa Monica Blvd. and Wilshire Blvd. with a small sculpture at the top of a Tongva kneeling in prayer. In April 1931, the new Italian Renaissance-style Beverly Hills City Hall was opened.
====1948: restrictive covenants found unenforceable====
In the early 1940s, black actors and businessmen had begun to move into Beverly Hills, despite the covenants allowing only whites to live in the city. A neighborhood improvement association attempted to enforce the covenants in court. The defendants included prominent artists Hattie McDaniel, Louise Beavers, and Ethel Waters. Among the white residents supporting the lawsuit against blacks was Harold Lloyd, the silent film star. The NAACP participated in the defense, which was successful. In his decision, federal judge Thurmond Clarke said that it was time that &quot;members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations or evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them under the 14th amendment.&quot; The United States Supreme Court declared restrictive covenants unenforceable in 1948 in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;. A group of Jewish residents of Beverly Hills filed an amicus brief in this case.

In 1956, Paul Trousdale (1915–1990) purchased the Doheny Ranch and developed it into Trousdale Estates, convincing the city of Beverly Hills to annex it. The neighborhood has been home to Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Curtis, Ray Charles, and President Richard Nixon, as well as, in later years, Jennifer Aniston, David Spade, Vera Wang and John Rich.
Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, many Persian Jews settled in Beverly Hills.

In the late 1990s, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) proposed to build an extension of the Metro D Line along Wilshire Boulevard and into Downtown Beverly Hills, but the city opposed it. The D Line Extension will ultimately be completed by 2027 and will include a station at Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive.

===21st century===
In 2001, LACMTA proposed a bus rapid transit route down Santa Monica Boulevard, but this was opposed by the city and never built. This stretch of road is served by less efficient Metro Rapid buses using pre-existing roadways. By 2010, traffic in Beverly Hills and surrounding areas had deteriorated enough that the city&#x27;s habitual opposition had largely turned to support for subways within the city limits. As part of the D Line Extension project, the D Line of the Los Angeles Metro Rail was intended in 2013 to be extended through Beverly Hills, adding two underground stations at Wilshire/La Cienega and Wilshire/Rodeo by the 2020s.

The city of Beverly Hills widely opposed Proposition 8, the 2008 ballot measure which repealed legal recognition of same-sex marriages. The proposition narrowly passed statewide, but in Beverly Hills, only 34% voted in favor, and 66% voted against it.

In the midst of the 2015 drought, Beverly Hills was found to be one of the largest water consumers in California. As a result, it was asked by the state to reduce consumption by 36%, prompting many residents to replace their lawns with native plants. Meanwhile, the city government replaced the grass in front of the City Hall with Mexican sage.

In September 2015, the City of Beverly Hills signed an agreement with Israel to work together on water use as well as &quot;cybersecurity, public health, emergency services, disaster preparedness, public safety, counterterrorism and art and culture&quot;.

In July 2016, the City of Beverly Hills received the Livability Award from the United States Conference of Mayors for its Ambassador Program, which takes care of the city&#x27;s homeless population.

The Beverly Hills Community Dog Park was dedicated on September 6, 2016.

<text>The Beatles, commonly referred to as the White Album, is the ninth studio album and only double album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 22 November 1968. Featuring a plain white sleeve, the cover contains no graphics or text other than the band&#x27;s name embossed. This was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band&#x27;s previous LP, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967). &quot;The Beatles&quot; is recognized for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, country rock, British blues, ska, music hall, proto-metal and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlando/NewYorker&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The album was the band&#x27;s first LP release on their then-recently founded Apple Records after previous albums were released on Parlophone in the United Kingdom and Capitol Records in the United States.

In late May 1968, the Beatles returned to EMI Studios in London to commence recording sessions that lasted until mid-October. During these sessions, arguments broke out among the foursome over creative differences and John Lennon&#x27;s new partner, Yoko Ono, whose constant presence subverted the Beatles&#x27; policy of excluding wives and girlfriends from the studio. After a series of problems, including producer George Martin taking an unannounced holiday and engineer Geoff Emerick suddenly quitting during a session, Ringo Starr left the band for two weeks in August. The same tensions continued throughout the following year and led to the band&#x27;s break-up.

The album features 30 songs, 19 of which were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. There, the only Western instrument available to the band was the acoustic guitar; several of these songs remained acoustic on &quot;The Beatles&quot; and were recorded solo, or only by part of the group. The production aesthetic ensured that the album&#x27;s sound was scaled down and less reliant on studio innovation than most of their releases since &quot;Revolver&quot; (1966). &quot;The Beatles&quot; also broke with the band&#x27;s tradition at the time of incorporating several musical styles in one song by keeping each piece of music consistently faithful to a select genre.

&quot;The Beatles&quot; received favourable reviews from most music critics; detractors found its satirical songs unimportant and apolitical amid the turbulent political and social climate of 1968. It topped record charts in Britain and the United States. No singles were issued in either territory, but &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; originated from the same recording sessions and were issued as a single in August 1968. The album has since been certified 24× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2018 to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

==Background==
By 1968, the Beatles had achieved commercial and critical success. The group&#x27;s mid-1967 release, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, was number one in the UK for 27 weeks, until the start of February 1968, having sold 250,000 copies in the first week after release. &quot;Time&quot; magazine declared that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; constituted a &quot;historic departure in the progress of music – any music&quot;, while the American writer Timothy Leary wrote that the band were &quot;the wisest, holiest, most effective avatars (Divine Incarnate, God Agents) that the human race has ever produced&quot;. The band received a negative critical response to their television film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, which aired in Britain in December 1967, but fan reaction was nevertheless positive.
Most of the songs for &quot;The Beatles&quot; were written during a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. The retreat involved long periods of meditation, conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours – a chance, in John Lennon&#x27;s words, to &quot;get away from everything&quot;. Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting &quot;clandestinely in the afternoons in each other&#x27;s rooms&quot; to review their new work. &quot;Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,&quot; Lennon later recalled, &quot;I did write some of my best songs there.&quot; Author Ian MacDonald said &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; was &quot;shaped by LSD&quot;, but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison&#x27;s development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became &quot;privately prolific&quot;, given his usual subordinate status within the group.

The Beatles left Rishikesh before the end of the course. Ringo Starr was the first to leave, less than two weeks later, as he said he could not tolerate the food; McCartney departed in mid-March, while Harrison and Lennon were more interested in Indian religion and remained until April. Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed after hearing rumours that the Maharishi had behaved inappropriately towards women who accompanied the Beatles to India. McCartney and Harrison later discovered the accusations to be untrue and Lennon&#x27;s wife Cynthia reported there was &quot;not a shred of evidence or justification&quot;.

Collectively, the group wrote around 40 new compositions in Rishikesh, 26 of which would be recorded in rough form at Kinfauns, Harrison&#x27;s home in Esher, in May 1968. Lennon wrote the bulk of the new material, contributing 14 songs. Lennon and McCartney brought home-recorded demos to the session, and worked on them together. Some home demos and group sessions at Kinfauns were later released on the 1996 compilation &quot;Anthology 3&quot;. The whole set of Esher demos was released in the remixed 50th anniversary deluxe edition in 2018.
==Style and production==

===Sessions===
&quot;The Beatles&quot; was recorded between 30 May and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios in London, with some sessions at Trident Studios. Their time in Rishikesh was soon forgotten in the tense atmosphere of the studio, with sessions occurring at irregular hours. The group&#x27;s self-belief led to the formation of a new multimedia business corporation, Apple Corps, an enterprise that drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects.

The group block-booked time at Abbey Road through July. The open-ended studio time led to a new way of working out songs. Instead of tightly rehearsing a backing track, as in previous sessions, the group recorded all the rehearsals and jamming, then added overdubs to the best take. The production aesthetic ensured that the album&#x27;s sound was scaled down and less reliant on studio innovation than &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;Not Guilty&quot; was left off the album, though 102 takes were recorded.

Only 16 of the album&#x27;s 30 tracks feature all four band members performing. Several backing tracks do not feature the full group, and overdubs tended to be performed by the composer of the song. McCartney and Lennon sometimes recorded simultaneously in different studios with different engineers. George Martin&#x27;s influence had gradually waned, and he left abruptly to go on a holiday during the recording sessions, leaving his young protégé Chris Thomas in charge of production.

During the sessions, the band upgraded from 4-track recording to 8-track. As work began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting unused for several months. This was in accordance with EMI&#x27;s policy of testing and customising new gear extensively before putting it into use. The Beatles recorded &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; at Trident because it had an 8-track console. When they learned that EMI also had one, they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries installed the machine (without studio management authorisation) in Abbey Road&#x27;s Studio 2.

The band held their first and only 24-hour session at Abbey Road during the final mixing and sequencing for the album. This session was attended by Lennon, McCartney and Martin; Harrison had left on a trip to the US the day before. Unlike most LPs, there was no customary three-second gap between tracks, and the master was edited so that songs segued together, via a straight edit, a crossfade, or an incidental piece of music.

===Genres and length===
&quot;The Beatles&quot; contains a wide range of musical styles, which authors Barry Miles and Gillian Gaar view as the most diverse of any of the group&#x27;s albums. These styles include rock and roll, blues, folk, country, reggae, avant-garde, hard rock, music hall and psychedelic music. The only Western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the acoustic guitar, and thus many of the songs were written and first performed on that instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on &quot;The Beatles&quot; and were recorded solo or by only part of the group (including &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;, &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;I Will&quot; and &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;).

Author Nicholas Schaffner views the acoustic slant as reflective of a widespread departure from the LSD-inspired psychedelia of 1967, an approach initiated by Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys and adopted in 1968 by artists such as the Rolling Stones and the Byrds. Edwin Faust of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; described &quot;The Beatles&quot; as &quot;foremost an album about musical purity (as the album cover and title suggest). Whereas on prior Beatles albums, the band was getting into the habit of mixing several musical genres into a single song, on &quot;The White Album&quot; every song is faithful to its selected genre. The rock n&#x27; roll tracks are purely rock n&#x27; roll; the folk songs are purely folk; the surreal pop numbers are purely surreal pop; and the experimental piece is purely experimental.&quot;

Martin said he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested that the group reduce the number of songs to form a single album featuring their stronger work; the band refused. Reflecting on the album years later, Harrison said that some tracks could have been released as B-sides or withheld, but &quot;there was a lot of ego in that band.&quot; He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the group&#x27;s backlog of songs. Starr felt that the album should have been two separate records, which he jokingly called &quot;The White Album&quot; and &quot;The Whiter Album&quot;. McCartney said that the record was fine as it was: &quot;It was great. It sold. It&#x27;s the bloody Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot;. Shut up!&quot;

===Personal issues===
During the recording sessions for &quot;The Beatles&quot;, each member of the band began to increasingly assert themselves as individual artists who frequently found themselves at odds. McCartney described the sessions as a turning point for the group because &quot;there was a lot of friction during that album. We were just about to break up, and that was tense in itself&quot;; Lennon said, &quot;the break-up of the Beatles can be heard on that album&quot;. Recording engineer Geoff Emerick had worked with the group since &quot;Revolver&quot;, but became disillusioned with the sessions. He overheard Martin criticising McCartney&#x27;s vocal performance while recording &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;, to which McCartney replied, &quot;Well you come down and sing it&quot;. On 16 July, Emerick announced that because of the frequent bickering and tension, he was no longer willing to work with the Beatles and left the studio in the midst of a session.

&quot;The Beatles&quot; sessions marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon&#x27;s new domestic and artistic partner, Yoko Ono, who accompanied him to Abbey Road to work on &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and who was thereafter a more or less constant presence at Beatles recording sessions. Ono&#x27;s presence was highly unorthodox as, up to that point, the Beatles had generally worked in isolation, rarely allowing visitors, wives and girlfriends to attend recording sessions. Lennon&#x27;s devotion to Ono over the other Beatles made working conditions difficult by impeding communication between Lennon and McCartney, as well as the intuitive aspect that had previously been essential to the band&#x27;s music. McCartney&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Francie Schwartz, was also present at some sessions, as were the other two Beatles&#x27; wives, Pattie Harrison and Maureen Starkey.

Peter Doggett writes that &quot;the most essential line of communication&quot; had been broken between Lennon and McCartney by Ono&#x27;s presence on the first day of recording. Beatles biographer Philip Norman comments that the two shared a disregard for the other&#x27;s new compositions; Lennon found McCartney&#x27;s songs &quot;cloyingly sweet and bland&quot;, while McCartney viewed Lennon&#x27;s as &quot;harsh, unmelodious and deliberately provocative&quot;. Harrison and Starr chose to distance themselves partway through the project, flying to California on 7 June so that Harrison could film his scenes for the Ravi Shankar documentary &quot;Raga&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s, McCartney&#x27;s and Harrison&#x27;s individual projects outside the band in 1968 were further evidence of the group&#x27;s fragmentation. In Lennon&#x27;s case, the album cover of his experimental collaboration with Ono &quot;Two Virgins&quot; featured the couple completely naked, a gesture his bandmates found bewildering and unnecessary.

On 20 August, Lennon and Starr were working on overdubs for &quot;Yer Blues&quot; in Studio 3, and visited McCartney in Studio 2 where he was working on &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;. The positive spirit of the session disappeared immediately, and engineer Ken Scott later claimed that &quot;you could cut the atmosphere with a knife&quot;. Starr abruptly left the studio on 22 August during the session for &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, feeling that his role in the group was peripheral compared to the other members, and upset at McCartney&#x27;s constant criticism of his drumming on the track. Abbey Road staff later commented that Starr was usually the first to arrive at the studio, waiting in the reception area for the others to arrive. In his absence, McCartney played the drums on &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;. For &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, the three remaining Beatles each made contributions on bass and drums, and the drum part is a composite of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison&#x27;s playing. Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison pleaded with Starr to reconsider. He returned on 5 September to find his drum kit decorated with flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison.

===Mono version===
&quot;The Beatles&quot; was the last Beatles album to be mixed separately for stereo and mono. All but two tracks exist in official mono mixes; the exceptions are &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, both direct reductions of the stereo master. The Beatles had not been particularly interested in stereo until this album, but after receiving mail from fans stating they bought both stereo and mono mixes of earlier albums, they decided to make the two different. Several mixes have different track lengths; the mono mix/edit of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; eliminates the fade-in at the end of the song (and Starr&#x27;s ending scream), and the fade-out of &quot;Yer Blues&quot; is 11 seconds longer on the mono mix. Several songs have missing or different overdubs or effects which differ from the stereo mixes.

In the United States, mono records were already being phased out; the US release of &quot;The Beatles&quot; was the first Beatles LP to be issued in stereo only. In the UK, the Beatles&#x27; following album, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, was the last to be issued in mono. The mono version of &quot;The Beatles&quot; was made available worldwide on 9 September 2009, as part of &quot;The Beatles in Mono&quot; CD boxed set. The original mono LP was rereleased worldwide in September 2014.

==Songs==

===Side one===
McCartney wrote &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as a parody of Chuck Berry&#x27;s song &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; and the Beach Boys. A field recording of a jet aeroplane taking off and landing was used at the start of the track, and intermittently throughout it. The backing vocals were sung by Lennon and Harrison in the style of the Beach Boys, further to Mike Love&#x27;s suggestion in Rishikesh that McCartney include mention of the &quot;girls&quot; in the USSR. The track became widely bootlegged in the Soviet Union, where the Beatles&#x27; music was banned, and became an underground hit.

&quot;Dear Prudence&quot; was one of the songs recorded at Trident. The style is typical of the acoustic songs written in Rishikesh, using guitar arpeggios. Lennon wrote the track about Mia Farrow&#x27;s sister Prudence Farrow, who rarely left her room during the stay in commitment to the meditation.

&quot;Glass Onion&quot; was the first backing track recorded as a full band after Starr&#x27;s brief departure. MacDonald claimed Lennon deliberately wrote the lyrics to mock fans who claimed to find &quot;hidden messages&quot; in songs, and referenced other songs in the Beatles catalogue – &quot;The Walrus was Paul&quot; refers back to &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; (which itself refers to &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;). McCartney, in turn, overdubbed a recorder part after the line &quot;I told you about the Fool on the Hill&quot;, as a deliberate reference to the earlier song. A string section was added to the track in October.
&quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; was written by McCartney as a pastiche of ska music. The track took a surprising amount of time to complete, with McCartney demanding perfectionism that annoyed his colleagues. Jimmy Scott, a friend of McCartney, suggested the title and played bongos on the initial take. He demanded a cut of publishing when the song was released, but the song was credited to &quot;Lennon–McCartney&quot;. After working for three days on the backing track, the work was scrapped and replaced with a new recording. Lennon hated the song, calling it &quot;granny music shit&quot;, while engineer Richard Lush recalled that Starr disliked having to record the same backing track repetitively, and pinpoints this session as a key indication that the Beatles were going to break up. McCartney attempted to remake the backing track for a third time, but this was abandoned after a few takes and the second version was used as the final mix. The group, save for McCartney, had lost interest in the track by the end of recording, and refused to release it as a single. Marmalade recorded a version that became a number one hit.

McCartney recorded &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot; on 20 August at the end of the session for &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;. It is typical of the brief snippets of songs he recorded between takes during the album sessions.

&quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot; was written by Lennon after an American visitor to Rishikesh left for a few weeks to hunt tigers. It was recorded as an &quot;audio vérité&quot; exercise, featuring vocal performances from almost everyone who happened to be in the studio at the time. Ono sings one line and co-sings another, while Chris Thomas played the Mellotron, including improvisations at the end of the track. The opening flamenco guitar flourish was a recording included in the Mellotron&#x27;s standard tape library.

&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was written by Harrison during a visit he made to his parents&#x27; home in Cheshire. He first recorded the song as a solo performance, on acoustic guitar, on 25 July – a version that remained unreleased until &quot;Anthology 3&quot;. He was unhappy with the group&#x27;s first attempt to record the track, and so invited his friend Eric Clapton to come and play on it. Clapton was unsure about guesting on a Beatles record, but Harrison said the decision was &quot;nothing to do with them. It&#x27;s my song.&quot; Clapton&#x27;s solo was treated with automatic double tracking to attain the desired effect; he gave Harrison the guitar he used, which Harrison later named &quot;Lucy&quot;.

&quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; evolved out of several song fragments that Lennon compiled into one piece, having previewed two of the segments in his May 1968 demo. According to MacDonald, this approach was possibly inspired by the Incredible String Band&#x27;s songwriting. The basic backing track ran to 95 takes, due to the irregular time signatures and variations in style throughout the song. The final version consisted of the best halves of two takes edited together. Lennon later described the song as one of his favourites, while the rest of the band found the recording rejuvenating, as it forced them to re-hone their skills as a group playing together to get it right. Apple&#x27;s press officer Derek Taylor made an uncredited contribution to the song&#x27;s lyrics.

===Side two===
McCartney got the title of &quot;Martha My Dear&quot; from his Old English Sheepdog, but the lyrics are otherwise unrelated. The entire track is played by him backed with session musicians, and features no other Beatles. Martin composed a brass band arrangement for the track.

&quot;I&#x27;m So Tired&quot; was written in India when Lennon was having difficulty sleeping. It was recorded at the same session as &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot;. The lyrics make reference to Walter Raleigh, calling him a &quot;stupid get&quot; for introducing tobacco to Europe; while the track ends with Lennon mumbling &quot;Monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?&quot; This became part of the Paul is Dead conspiracy theory, when fans claimed that when the track was reversed, they could hear &quot;Paul is dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him&quot;.

&quot;Blackbird&quot; features McCartney solo, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar. According to Lewisohn, the ticking in the background is a metronome, but Emerick recalls capturing the sound via a microphone placed beside McCartney&#x27;s shoes. The birdsong on the track was taken from the Abbey Road sound effects collection, and was recorded on one of the first EMI portable tape recorders.

Harrison wrote &quot;Piggies&quot; as an attack on greed and materialism in modern society. His mother and Lennon helped him complete the lyrics. Thomas played harpsichord on the track, while Lennon supplied a tape loop of pigs grunting.

&quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot; evolved from a jam session with McCartney, Lennon and Donovan in Rishikesh. The song was taped in a single session, and was one of the tracks that Martin felt was &quot;filler&quot; and put on only because the album was a double.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot; was Starr&#x27;s first solo composition for the band; he had been toying with the idea of writing a self-reflective song for some time, possibly as far back as 1963. It went by the working titles of &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Tune&quot; and &quot;This Is Some Friendly&quot;. The basic track consisted of Starr drumming while McCartney played piano. Martin composed an orchestral introduction to the song but it was rejected as &quot;too bizarre&quot; and left off the album. Instead, Jack Fallon played a bluegrass fiddle part.

McCartney wrote &quot;Why Don&#x27;t We Do It in the Road?&quot; in India after he saw two monkeys copulating in the street and wondered why humans were too civilised to do the same. He played all the instruments except drums, which were contributed by Starr. The simple lyric was very much in Lennon&#x27;s style, and Lennon was annoyed not to be asked to play on it. McCartney suggested it was &quot;tit for tat&quot; as he had not contributed to &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.

McCartney wrote and sang &quot;I Will&quot;, with Lennon and Starr accompanying on percussion. In between numerous takes, the three Beatles broke off to busk some other songs. A snippet of a track known as &quot;Can You Take Me Back?&quot; was put between &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, while recordings of Cilla Black&#x27;s hit &quot;Step Inside Love&quot; and a joke number, &quot;Los Paranoias&quot;, were released on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;.

&quot;Julia&quot; was the last track to be recorded for the album and features Lennon on solo acoustic guitar, which he played in a style similar to McCartney&#x27;s on &quot;Blackbird&quot;. This is the only Beatles song on which Lennon performs alone. It is a tribute to his mother, Julia Lennon, who was killed in 1958 in a road accident when Lennon was 17, and the lyrics deal with the loss of his mother and his relationship with Ono, the &quot;ocean child&quot; in the lyrics. Ono helped with the lyrics, but the song was still credited to Lennon–McCartney as expected.

===Side three===
According to McCartney, the authorship of &quot;Birthday&quot; was &quot;50–50 John and me, made up on the spot and recorded all on the same evening&quot;. He and Lennon were inspired to write the song after seeing the first UK showing of the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll film &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; on television, and sang the lead vocal in the style of the film&#x27;s musical star, Little Richard. After the Beatles taped the track, Ono and Pattie Harrison added backing vocals.

Lennon wrote &quot;Yer Blues&quot; in India. Despite meditating and the tranquil atmosphere, he still felt unhappy, as reflected in the lyrics. The style was influenced by the British Blues Boom of 1968, which included Fleetwood Mac, Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jeff Beck and Chicken Shack. The backing track was recorded in a small room next to the Studio 2 control room. Unusual for a Beatles recording, the four-track source tape was edited directly, resulting in an abrupt cut-off at 3&#x27;17&quot; into the start of another take (which ran into the fadeout).

McCartney wrote &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot; in India, and worked on it in isolation from the other members of the band. He performed the track solo alongside a Martin-scored brass arrangement.

&quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey&quot; evolved from a jam session and was originally untitled. The final mix was sped up by mixing the tape running at 43 hertz instead of the usual 50. Harrison claimed the title came from one of the Maharishi&#x27;s sayings (with &quot;and my monkey&quot; added later).

&quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; was written as &quot;Maharishi&quot; by Lennon shortly after he decided to leave Rishikesh. In a 1980 interview, Lennon acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song: &quot;I just called him &#x27;Sexy Sadie&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Helter Skelter&quot; was written by McCartney and was initially recorded in July as a blues number. The band performed the initial takes live and included long passages during which they jammed on their instruments. Because these takes were too long to practically fit on an LP, the song was shelved until September, when a new, shorter version was made. By all accounts, the session was chaotic, but nobody dared suggest to any of the Beatles that they were out of control. Harrison reportedly ran around the studio holding a flaming ashtray above his head, &quot;doing an Arthur Brown&quot;. The stereo version of the LP includes almost a minute more music than the mono, which culminates in Starr famously shouting &quot;I&#x27;ve got blisters on my fingers!&quot; Cult leader and mass murderer Charles Manson was unaware that the term &quot;helter skelter&quot; is British English for a spiral slide found on a playground or funfair, and assumed the track had something to do with hell. This was one of the tracks that led Manson to believe the album had coded messages referring to apocalyptic war, and led to his movement of the same name.

The final song on side three is Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Long, Long, Long&quot;, part of a chord progression he took from Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot;. MacDonald describes the song as Harrison&#x27;s &quot;touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God&quot; and considered it to be his &quot;finest moment on &quot;The Beatles&quot;&quot;. The recording session for the basic track was one of the longest the Beatles ever undertook, running from the afternoon of 7 October through the night until 7 am the next day. McCartney played Hammond organ on the track, and an &quot;eerie rattling&quot; effect at the end was created by a note causing a wine bottle on top of the organ&#x27;s Leslie speaker to resonate.

===Side four===
&quot;Revolution 1&quot; was the first track recorded for the album, with sessions for the backing track starting on 30 May. The initial takes were recorded as a possible single, but as the session progressed, the arrangement became slower, with more of a laid-back groove. The group ended the chosen take with a six-minute improvisation that had further overdubs added, before being cut to the length heard on the album. The brass arrangement was added later.

McCartney wrote &quot;Honey Pie&quot; as a pastiche of the 1920s&#x27; flapper dance style. The opening section had the sound of an old 78 RPM record overdubbed while Martin arranged a saxophone and clarinet part in the same style. Lennon played the guitar solo on the track, but later said he hated the song, calling it &quot;beyond redemption&quot;.

&quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; was named after one of the types of chocolate found in a box of Mackintosh&#x27;s Good News, which Clapton enjoyed eating. The track featured a saxophone sextet arranged by Thomas, who also played keyboards. Harrison later said that Derek Taylor helped him finish the lyrics.

Lennon began writing &quot;Cry Baby Cry&quot; in late 1967 and the lyrics were partly derived from the tagline of an old television commercial. Martin played harmonium on the track.

&quot;Revolution 9&quot; evolved from the overdubs from the &quot;Revolution 1&quot; coda. Lennon, Harrison and Ono added further tape collages and spoken word extracts, in the style of Karlheinz Stockhausen. The track opens with an extract of a piano theme from a Royal Schools of Music examination tape, and climaxes with Ono saying &quot;if you become naked&quot;. Ono was heavily involved in the production, and advised Lennon on what tape loops to use. McCartney was out of the country at the time and did not contribute to the track, and was reportedly unhappy that it was included. He had led similar tape experiments such as &quot;Carnival of Light&quot; in January 1967. The track has attracted both interest and disapproval from fans and critics over the years.

Lennon wrote &quot;Good Night&quot; as a lullaby for his son Julian, and wanted Starr to sing it. The early takes featured just Lennon on acoustic guitar and Starr singing. Martin scored an orchestral and choral arrangement that replaced the guitar in the final mix, and also played the celesta.

===Singles===
&quot;Hey Jude&quot; was recorded at the end of July 1968 during the sessions for &quot;The Beatles&quot; but was issued separately as a single nearly three months before the album&#x27;s release. This was the first release on Apple Records and ultimately the band&#x27;s most successful single in the US. The B-side, &quot;Revolution&quot;, was a different version of the album&#x27;s &quot;Revolution 1&quot;. Lennon wanted the original version of &quot;Revolution&quot; to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected that it was too slow. Instead, the single featured a new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and an electric piano solo by Nicky Hopkins.

The convention in the British music industry at the time was that singles and albums were distinct entities and should not duplicate songs. But although no singles were taken from &quot;The Beatles&quot; in Britain or America, &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; backed with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was released in other markets. The single was a commercial success in Australia (where it spent five weeks at number one on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; chart), Japan, Austria and Switzerland.

===Unreleased material===
Some songs the Beatles were working on individually during this period were revisited for inclusion on their subsequent albums, while others were released on the band members&#x27; solo albums. According to the bootlegged album of the demos made at Kinfauns, the latter of these two categories includes Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Look at Me&quot; and &quot;Child of Nature&quot; (eventually reworked as &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;); McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Junk&quot;; and Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Not Guilty&quot; and &quot;Circles&quot;. In addition, Harrison gave &quot;Sour Milk Sea&quot; to the singer Jackie Lomax, whose recording, produced by Harrison, was released in August 1968 as Lomax&#x27;s debut single on Apple Records. Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot; and &quot;Polythene Pam&quot; were used in the medley on &quot;Abbey Road&quot; the following year.

The Lennon composition &quot;What&#x27;s the New Mary Jane&quot; was demoed at Kinfauns and recorded formally (by Lennon, Harrison and Ono) during the 1968 album sessions. McCartney taped demos of two compositions at Abbey Road – &quot;Etcetera&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; – the latter of which the Beatles recorded in 1969 on &quot;Let It Be&quot;. &quot;The Beatles&quot; versions of &quot;Not Guilty&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s the New Mary Jane&quot; and a demo of &quot;Junk&quot; were released on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;.

&quot;Revolution (Take 20)&quot;, a previously uncirculated recording, surfaced in 2009 on a bootleg. This ten-minute take was later edited and overdubbed to create two separate tracks: &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and the avant-garde &quot;Revolution 9&quot;.

==Release==
===Packaging===
&quot;The Beatles&quot; was issued on 22 November 1968 in Britain and three days later in the US. It was the third album to be released by Apple Records, following Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Wonderwall Music&quot; and Lennon and Ono&#x27;s &quot;Two Virgins&quot;. The record was referred to as &quot;the White Album&quot; immediately upon release.

Conceptual artist Richard Hamilton designed the record sleeve in collaboration with McCartney. Hamilton&#x27;s design was in stark contrast to Pop artists Peter Blake&#x27;s and Jann Haworth&#x27;s elaborate and vivid cover art for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band&#x27;s name, in Helvetica, was crookedly blind embossed slightly below the middle of the album&#x27;s right side. Later vinyl record releases in the US showed the title in grey printed (rather than embossed) letters. Each copy of the record featured a unique stamped serial number, &quot;to create&quot;, in Hamilton&#x27;s words, &quot;the ironic situation of a numbered edition of something like five million copies&quot;. The first four numbered copies were given to the members of the band, making number 0000005 the first copy sold publicly; in 2008, it was purchased for £19,201 on eBay. In 2015, Ringo Starr&#x27;s copy, number 0000001, sold for a world record $790,000 at auction. In an interview on the Impossible Way of Life podcast, it was first revealed by members of Hotline TNT that the winner of the auction was Jack White and that the album is currently held in the vault at the headquarters of Third Man Records in Nashville, TN.

The sleeve included a poster comprising a montage of photographs, with the lyrics of the songs on the back, and a set of four photographic portraits taken by John Kelly. The photographs for the poster were assembled by Hamilton and McCartney, who sorted them in a variety of ways over several days before arriving at the final result.

During production, the album had the working title of &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. This was changed when the English progressive rock band Family released the similarly titled &quot;Music in a Doll&#x27;s House&quot; earlier that year.

===Sales===
In the UK, &quot;The Beatles&quot; debuted at number one on 7 December 1968 and spent seven weeks at the top of the UK charts (including the entire competitive Christmas season), until it was replaced by the Seekers&#x27; &quot;Best of the Seekers&quot; on 25 January 1969, dropping to number 2. However, the album returned to the top spot the following week, spending an eighth and final week at number 1. The album was still high in the charts when the Beatles&#x27; follow-up album, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, was released, which reached number 3. In all, &quot;The Beatles&quot; spent 22 weeks on the UK charts, far fewer than the 149 weeks for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. In September 2013, after the British Phonographic Industry changed their sales award rules, the album was declared as having gone platinum, meaning sales of at least 300,000 copies.

In the US, the album achieved huge commercial success. Capitol Records sold over 3.3 million copies of &quot;The Beatles&quot; to stores within the first four days of the album&#x27;s release. It debuted at number 11 on 14 December 1968, jumped to number 2, and reached number 1 in its third week on 28 December, spending a total of nine weeks at the top. In all, &quot;The Beatles&quot; spent 215 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album has sold over 12 million copies in the US alone and according to the Recording Industry Association of America, &quot;The Beatles&quot; is the Beatles&#x27; most-certified album, at 24-times platinum.

==Critical reception==

===Contemporary reviews===
On release, &quot;The Beatles&quot; gained highly favourable reviews from the majority of music critics. Others bemoaned its length or found that the music lacked the adventurous quality that had distinguished &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. According to the author Ian Inglis: &quot;Whether positive or negative, all assessments of &quot;The Beatles&quot; drew attention to its fragmentary style. However, while some complained about the lack of a coherent style, others recognized this as the album&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;.&quot;

In &quot;The Observer&quot;, Tony Palmer wrote: &quot;If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the greatest songwriters since Schubert&quot;, the album &quot;should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making&quot;. Richard Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered the double album to be &quot;a major success&quot; and &quot;far more imaginative&quot; than &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, due to the band&#x27;s improved songwriting and their relying less on the studio tricks of those earlier works. In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Derek Jewell hailed it as &quot;the best thing in pop since &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;&quot; and concluded: &quot;Musically, there is beauty, horror, surprise, chaos, order. And that is the world; and that is what The Beatles are on about. Created by, creating for, their age.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald/WhiteRiot&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although he dismissed &quot;Revolution 9&quot; as a &quot;pretentious&quot; example of &quot;idiot immaturity&quot;, the &quot;NME&quot;″s Alan Smith declared &quot;God Bless You, Beatles!&quot; to the majority of the album. Jann Wenner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;the history and synthesis of Western music&quot;, and the group&#x27;s best album yet. Wenner contended that they were allowed to appropriate other styles and traditions into rock music because their ability and identity were &quot;so strong that they make it uniquely theirs, and uniquely the Beatles. They are so good that they not only expand the idiom, but they are also able to penetrate it and take it further.&quot;

Among the less favourable critiques, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewer wrote that &quot;The Beatles&quot; showcased the &quot;best abilities and worst tendencies&quot; of the Beatles, as it is skilfully performed and sophisticated, but lacks a &quot;sense of taste and purpose&quot;. William Mann of &quot;The Times&quot; opined that, in their over-reliance on and &quot;private jokes&quot;, Lennon and McCartney had ceased to progress as songwriters, yet he deemed the release to be &quot;The most important musical event of the year&quot; and acknowledged: &quot;these 30 tracks contain plenty to be studied, enjoyed and gradually appreciated more fully in the coming months.&quot; In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Nik Cohn considered the album &quot;boring beyond belief&quot; and said that over half of its songs were &quot;profound mediocrities&quot;. In a 1971 column, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; described the album as both &quot;their most consistent and probably their worst&quot;, and referred to its songs as a &quot;pastiche of musical exercises&quot;. Nonetheless, he ranked it as the tenth best album of 1968 in his ballot for &quot;Jazz &amp; Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual critics poll.

===Retrospective assessments===
In a 2003 appraisal of the album, for &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, Ian MacDonald wrote that &quot;The Beatles&quot; regularly appears among the top 10 in critics&#x27; &quot;best albums of all time&quot; lists, yet it was a work that he deemed &quot;eccentric, highly diverse, and very variable [in] quality&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacDonald/WhiteRiot55&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), said that its songs ranged from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;sturdiest tunes since &quot;Revolver&quot;&quot; to &quot;self-indulgent filler&quot;. He derided tracks including &quot;Revolution 9&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, but said that picking personal highlights was &quot;part of the fun&quot; for listeners. Writing for MusicHound in 1999, &quot;Guitar World&quot; editor Christopher Scapelliti described the album as &quot;self-indulgent and at times unlistenable&quot; but identified &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as &quot;fascinating standouts&quot; that made it a worthwhile purchase.

According to &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Eric Henderson, &quot;The Beatles&quot; is a rarity among the band&#x27;s recorded works, in that it &quot;resists reflexive canonisation, which, along with society&#x27;s continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising&quot;. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that because of its wide variety of musical styles, the album can be &quot;a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view&quot;. He concludes: &quot;None of it sounds like it was meant to share album space together, but somehow &quot;The Beatles&quot; creates its own style and sound through its mess.&quot;

Among reviews of the 2009 remastered album, Neil McCormick of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found that even its worst songs work within the context of such an eclectic and unconventional collection, which he rated &quot;one of the greatest albums ever made&quot;. Writing for &quot;Paste&quot;, Mark Kemp said &quot;The Beatles&quot; had been wrongly described as &quot;three solo works in one (plus a Ringo song)&quot;, saying it &quot;benefits from each member&#x27;s wildly different ideas&quot; and offers &quot;two of Harrison&#x27;s finest moments&quot;. In his review for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Chuck Klosterman wrote that the album found the band at their best and rated it &quot;almost beyond an A+&quot;. In retrospect, Christgau wrote in 2020 that while he still found the album &quot;somewhat scattered&quot;, he nevertheless considers it worthy of a &quot;high A minus&quot;. Contrary to many other retrospective assessments, John O&#x27;Reilly of &quot;The Guardian&quot; rated the album two stars out of five, stating: &quot;Inside this mess of a double album is an OK single album whimpering to get out.&quot; 

In 2000, &quot;The Beatles&quot; was voted number 5 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. Three years later, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 10 on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, a position it maintained in the 2012 revised list. On the 40th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, the Vatican newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; wrote that it &quot;remains a type of magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; placed the album at number 49 on a list of &quot;The 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time&quot;. The magazine praised the guitar work in &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In September 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;The Beatles&quot; at number 29 on its new list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

Giles Martin, son of George Martin and supervisor of the 2018 50th Anniversary remix, stated that, contrary to the prevailing view of &quot;The Beatles&quot;, he does not believe it was recorded by a band about to implode. He said he came to this conclusion after listening to all the demos and session tapes in preparation for the remix.

==Cultural responses==
The release coincided with public condemnation of Lennon&#x27;s treatment of Cynthia, and of his and Ono&#x27;s joint projects, particularly &quot;Two Virgins&quot;. The British authorities similarly displayed a less tolerant attitude towards the Beatles, when London Drug Squad officers arrested Lennon and Ono in October 1968 for marijuana possession, a charge that he claimed was false.

===Lyrical misinterpretations===
The album&#x27;s lyrics progressed from being vague to open-ended and prone to misinterpretation of authorial intention, such as &quot;Glass Onion&quot; (e.g., &quot;the walrus was Paul&quot;) and &quot;Piggies&quot; (&quot;what they need&#x27;s a damn good whacking&quot;). In the case of &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, the words were interpreted by Christian evangelist David Noebel as further proof of the Beatles&#x27; compliance in a Communist plot to brainwash American youth. According to MacDonald, the counterculture of the 1960s analysed &quot;The Beatles&quot; above and beyond all of the band&#x27;s previous releases. Lennon&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Revolution 1&quot; were misinterpreted with messages he did not intend. In the album version, he advises those who &quot;talk about destruction&quot; to &quot;count me out&quot;. Lennon then follows the sung word &quot;out&quot; with the spoken word &quot;in&quot;. At the time of the album&#x27;s release – which followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, &quot;Revolution&quot; – that single word &quot;in&quot; was taken by the radical political left as Lennon&#x27;s endorsement of politically motivated violence, which followed the May 1968 Paris riots. However, the album version was recorded first.

Charles Manson first heard the album not long after it was released. Manson may have found hidden meanings in songs from earlier Beatles albums, but, according to Vincent Bugliosi in &quot;The Beatles&quot;, Manson allegedly interpreted prophetic significance in several of the songs, including &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Piggies&quot; (particularly the line &quot;what they need&#x27;s a damn good whacking&quot;), &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, &quot;Revolution 1&quot; and &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, and interpreted the lyrics as a sign of imminent violence or war. He and other members and associates of the Manson family repeatedly listened to it, and he allegedly told them that it was an apocalyptic message predicting an uprising of oppressed races, drawing parallels with chapter 9 of the Book of Revelation. Paul McCartney said, &quot;Charles Manson interpreted that Helter Skelter was something to do with the four horsemen of the Apocalypse.&quot;

===New Left criticism===
Further to the betrayal they had felt at Lennon&#x27;s non-activist stance in &quot;Revolution&quot;, New Left commentators condemned &quot;The Beatles&quot; for its failure to offer a political agenda. The Beatles themselves were accused of using eclecticism and pastiche as a means of avoiding important issues in the turbulent political and social climate. Jon Landau, writing for the Liberation News Service, argued that, particularly in &quot;Piggies&quot; and &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;, the band had adopted parody because they were &quot;afraid of confronting reality&quot; and &quot;the urgencies of the moment&quot;. Like Landau, many writers among the New Left considered the album outdated and irrelevant; instead, they heralded the Rolling Stones&#x27; concurrent release, &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, as what Lennon biographer Jon Wiener terms &quot;the &#x27;strong solution,&#x27; a musical turning outward, toward the political and social battles of the day&quot;.

===Popular music and postmodernism===
Sociologists Michael Katovich and Wesley Longhofer write that the album&#x27;s release created &quot;a collective appreciation of it as a &#x27;state-of-the-art&#x27; rendition of the current pop, rock, and folk-rock sounds&quot;. The majority of historians categorise &quot;The Beatles&quot; as postmodern, emphasising aesthetic and stylistic features of the album; Inglis, for example, lists bricolage, fragmentation, pastiche, parody, reflexivity, plurality, irony, exaggeration, anti-representation and &quot;meta-art&quot;, and says that it &quot;has been designated as popular music&#x27;s first postmodern album&quot;. Authors such as Fredric Jameson, Andrew Goodwin and Kenneth Womack instead situate all of the Beatles&#x27; work within a modernist stance, based either on their &quot;artificiality&quot; or their ideological stance of progress through love and peace. Scapelliti cites &quot;The Beatles&quot; as the source of &quot;the freeform nihilism echoed … in the punk and alternative music genres&quot;. In his introduction to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;, Elvis Costello comments on the band&#x27;s pervasive influence into the 21st century and concludes: &quot;The scope and license of the White Album has permitted everyone from OutKast to Radiohead to Green Day to Joanna Newsom to roll their picture out on a broader, bolder canvas.&quot;

In early 2013, the Recess Gallery in New York City&#x27;s SoHo neighbourhood presented &quot;We Buy White Albums&quot;, an installation by artist Rutherford Chang. The piece was in the form of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. Chang created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the LP were overlaid.

==Reissues==
Tape versions of the album did not feature a white cover or the numbering system. Instead, cassette and 8-track versions (issued on two cassettes/cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured high contrast black and white (with no grey) versions of the four Kelly photographs. These two-tape releases were both contained in black outer cardboard slipcase covers embossed with the words &quot;The Beatles&quot; and the outline of an apple in gold print. The songs on the cassette version of &quot;The Beatles&quot; are sequenced differently from the album, in order to equalise the lengths of the tape sides. Two reel-to-reel tape releases of the album were issued, both using the monochrome Kelly artwork. The first, issued by Apple/EMI in early 1969, packaged the entire double-LP on a single tape, with the songs in the same running order as on the LPs. The second release, licensed by Ampex from EMI in early 1970 after the latter ceased manufacture of commercial reel-to-reel tapes, was issued as two separate volumes, and sequenced the songs in the same manner as on the cassette version. The Ampex reel tape version of &quot;The Beatles&quot; has become desirable to collectors, as it contains edits on eight tracks not available elsewhere.

During 1978 and 1979, for the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary, EMI reissued the album pressed on limited edition white vinyl in several countries. In 1981, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) issued a unique half-speed master variation of the album using the sound from the original master recording. The discs were pressed on high-quality virgin vinyl.

The album was reissued, along with the rest of the Beatles catalogue, on compact disc in 1987. Unlike other Beatles CDs in this reissue campaign, the discs for &quot;The Beatles&quot; featured solid black-on-white labels instead of the then-conventional black-on-transparent, and releases that packaged each disc into a separate jewel case (rather than a multi-disc &quot;fatbox&quot;) sported white media trays rather than the typical dark gray. Like the original vinyl pressings, these CD copies also featured individually stamped numbers on the album&#x27;s front cover (in this case on the cover of the booklet for the first disc). It was reissued again on CD in 1998 as part of a 30th anniversary series for EMI, featuring a scaled-down replication of the original artwork, including the top-loader gatefold sleeve. This was part of a reissue series from EMI that included albums from other artists such as the Rolling Stones and Roxy Music. It was reissued again in 2009 in a new remastered edition.

A remixed and expanded edition of the album was released in 2018 to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

<text>Jasper, an aggregate of microgranular quartz and/or cryptocrystalline chalcedony and other mineral phases, is an opaque, impure variety of silica, usually red, yellow, brown or green in color; and rarely blue. The common red color is due to iron(III) inclusions. Jasper breaks with a smooth surface and is used for ornamentation or as a gemstone. It can be highly polished and is used for items such as vases, seals, and snuff boxes. The density of jasper is typically 2.5 to 2.9 g/cm3. Jaspillite is a banded-iron-formation rock that often has distinctive bands of jasper.

==Etymology and history==

The name means &quot;spotted or speckled stone,&quot; and is derived via Old French (variant of Anglo-Norman &quot;jaspe&quot;) and Latin (nom. ) from Greek &quot;iaspis&quot; (feminine noun), from an Afroasiatic language (cf. Hebrew &quot;&quot; , Akkadian &quot;yashupu&quot;). This Semitic etymology is believed to be unrelated to that of the English given name Jasper, which is of Persian origin, though the Persian word for the mineral jasper is also &quot;yashum&quot; (یَشم).

Green jasper was used to make bow drills in Mehrgarh between 4th and Jasper is known to have been a favorite gem in the ancient world; its name can be traced back in Arabic, Persian, Hebrew, Assyrian, Greek and Latin. On Minoan Crete, jasper was carved to produce seals circa 1800 BC, as evidenced by archaeological recoveries at the palace of Knossos.

Although the term jasper is now restricted to opaque quartz, the ancient &quot;iaspis&quot; was a stone of considerable translucency including nephrite. The jasper of antiquity was in many cases distinctly green, for it is often compared to emerald and other green objects. Jasper is referred to in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; as being clear and green. The jasper of the ancients probably included stones which would now be classed as chalcedony, and the emerald-like jasper may have been akin to the modern chrysoprase. The Hebrew word may have designated a green jasper. Flinders Petrie suggested that the &quot;odem&quot; – the first stone on the High Priest&#x27;s breastplate – was a red jasper, whilst &quot;tarshish&quot;, the tenth stone, may have been a yellow jasper.
==Types==

Jasper is an opaque rock of virtually any colour stemming from the mineral content of the original sediments or ash. Patterns arise during the consolidation process forming flow and depositional patterns in the original silica-rich sediment or volcanic ash. Hydrothermal circulation is generally thought to be required in the formation of jasper.

Jasper can be modified by the diffusion of minerals along discontinuities providing the appearance of vegetative growth, i.e., dendritic. The original materials are often fractured and/or distorted, after deposition, into diverse patterns, which are later filled in with other colorful minerals. Weathering, with time, will create intensely colored superficial rinds.

The classification and naming of jasper varieties presents a challenge. Terms attributed to various well-defined materials includes the geographic locality where it is found, sometimes quite restricted such as &quot;Bruneau&quot; (a canyon) and &quot;Lahontan&quot; (a lake), rivers and even individual mountains; many are fanciful, such as &quot;forest fire&quot; or &quot;rainbow&quot;, while others are descriptive, such as &quot;autumn&quot; or &quot;porcelain&quot;. A few are designated by the place of origin such as a brown Egyptian or red African.

===Banded iron formations ===
Jasper is the main component in the silica-rich parts of banded iron formations (BIFs) which indicate low, but present, amounts of dissolved oxygen in the water such as during the Great Oxidation Event or snowball earths. The red bands are microcrystalline red chert, also called jasper.

===Picture jaspers===
Picture jaspers exhibit combinations of patterns resulting in what appear to be scenes or images, when seen on a cut section. Such patterns include banding from flow or depositional patterns (from water or wind), as well as dendritic or color variations. Diffusion from a center produces a distinctive orbicular appearance, i.e., leopard skin jasper or linear banding from a fracture as seen in liesegang jasper. Healed, fragmented rock produces brecciated (broken) jasper.

While these &quot;picture jaspers&quot; can be found all over the world, specific colors or patterns are unique to the geographic region from which they originate. One source of the stone is Indonesia, especially in Purbalingga district. From the US, Oregon&#x27;s Biggs jasper and Idaho&#x27;s Bruneau jasper from the Bruneau River canyon are particularly fine examples. Other examples can be seen at Ynys Llanddwyn in Wales. A blue-green jasper occurs in a deposit at Ettutkan Mountain, Staryi Sibay, Bashkortostan, Russia. (The town of Sibay, in the far south of the Ural Mountains, near the border with Kazakhstan, is noted for its colossal, open-cast copper mine.)

===Basanite and other types of touchstone===
Basanite is a deep velvety-black variety of amorphous quartz, of a slightly tougher and finer grain than jasper, and less splintery than hornstone. It was the &quot;Lydian stone&quot; or &quot;touchstone&quot; of the ancients. It is mentioned and its use described in the writings of Bacchylides about 450 BC, and was also described by Theophrastus in his book &quot;On Stones&quot; (Ancient Greek title: : &quot;Peri Lithon&quot;), a century later. It is evident that the touchstone that Pliny had in mind when he wrote about it was merely a dense variety of basalt.

Basanite (not to be confused with bassanite), &quot;Lydian stone&quot;, and radiolarite (a.k.a. lydite or flinty slate) are terms used to refer to several types of black, jasper-like rock (also including tuffs, cherts and siltstones) which are dense, fine-grained and flinty / cherty in texture and found in a number of localities. The &quot;Lydian Stone&quot; known to the Ancient Greeks is named for the ancient kingdom of Lydia in what is now western Turkey. A similar rock type occurs in New England. Such rock types have long been used for the making of touchstones to test the purity of precious metal alloys, because they are hard enough to scratch such metals, which, if drawn (scraped) across them, show to advantage their metallic streaks of various (diagnostic) colours, against the dark background. There are, confusingly, not one but two rocks called basanite, one being a black form of jasper and the other a black volcanic rock closely akin to basalt. Add to this the fact that many different rock types – having in common the colour black and a fine texture – have, over the ages, been pressed into service as touchstones and it will be seen that there is ample scope for confusion in this petrology- and mineralogy-related field of study.

<text>A court is an institution, often a government entity, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and administer justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law.

Courts generally consist of judges or other judicial officers, and are usually established and dissolved through legislation enacted by a legislature. Courts may also be established by constitution or an equivalent constituting instrument.

The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction, which describes the court&#x27;s power to decide certain kinds of questions, or petitions put to it. There are various kinds of courts, including trial courts, appellate courts, administrative courts, international courts, and tribunals.

== Description ==
A court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.

The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary. The place where a court sits is known as a venue. The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a courthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large complex facilities in urban communities.

The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin , from , &quot;of the law&quot;, + , &quot;to declare&quot;, + , &quot;noun-forming suffix&quot;), the court&#x27;s power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. According to William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England,&quot; a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy. It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury.

==Etymology==

The word &quot;court&quot; comes from the French , an enclosed yard, which derives from the Latin form , the accusative case of , which again means an enclosed yard or the occupants of such a yard. The English word &quot;court&quot; is thus a descendant of the Latin word from Ancient Greek () (meaning &quot;garden&quot;, hence horticulture and orchard), both referring to an enclosed space.

The meaning of a judicial assembly is first attested in the 12th century, and derives from the earlier usage to designate a sovereign and his entourage, which met to adjudicate disputes in such an enclosed yard. The verb &quot;to court&quot;, meaning to win favor, derives from the same source since people traveled to the sovereign&#x27;s court to win his favor.

The term &quot;the court&quot; is used to refer to the presiding officer or officials, usually one or more judges. The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as &quot;the bench&quot; (in contrast to attorneys and barristers, collectively referred to as &quot;the bar&quot;). In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on personal jurisdiction over the parties to the litigation and subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted.

The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the &quot;judiciary&quot;. The place where a court sits is known as a &quot;venue&quot;. The room where court proceedings occur is known as a &quot;courtroom&quot;, and the building as a &quot;courthouse&quot;; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large complex facilities in urban communities.

==Jurisdiction==
The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin , from , &quot;of the law&quot;, + , &quot;to declare&quot;, + , &quot;noun-forming suffix&quot;), the court&#x27;s power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it. According to William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England,&quot; a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy. It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury. &quot;Jurisdiction&quot; is defined as the official authority to make legal decisions and judgements over a person or material item within a territory.

&quot;Whether a given court has jurisdiction to preside over a given case&quot; is a key question in any legal action. Three basic components of jurisdiction are personal jurisdiction over an individual or thing (), jurisdiction over the particular subject matter (subject-matter jurisdiction) and territorial jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over a person refers to the full authority over a person regardless of where they live, jurisdiction over a particular subject matter refers to the authority over the said subject of legal cases involved in a case, and lastly territorial jurisdiction is the authority over a person within an x amount of space.

Other concepts of jurisdiction include general, exclusive, appellate, and (in the United States federal courts) diversity jurisdiction.

== Types and organization of courts ==
Courts may be organized into a hierarchy of courts and have specific jurisdiction and include specialized courts.

=== Trial and appellate courts ===

Trial courts are courts that hold trials. Sometimes termed &quot;courts of first instance&quot;, trial courts have varying original jurisdiction. Trial courts may conduct trials with juries as the finders of fact (these are known as jury trials) or trials in which judges act as both finders of fact and finders of law (in some jurisdictions these are known as bench trials). Juries are less common in court systems outside the Anglo-American common law tradition.

Appellate courts are courts that hear appeals of lower courts and trial courts.

Some courts, such as the Crown Court in England and Wales, may have both trial and appellate jurisdictions.

=== Civil law courts and common law courts ===
The two major legal traditions of the western world are the civil law courts and the common law courts. These two great legal traditions are similar, in that they are products of western culture, although there are significant differences between the two traditions. Civil law courts are profoundly based upon Roman law, specifically a civil body of law entitled . This theory of civil law was rediscovered around the end of the eleventh century and became a foundation for university legal education starting in Bologna, Italy and subsequently being taught throughout continental European universities.

Civil law is firmly ensconced in the French and German legal systems. Common law courts were established by English royal judges of the King&#x27;s Council after the Norman Invasion of Britain in 1066. The royal judges created a body of law by combining local customs they were made aware of through traveling and visiting local jurisdictions. This common standard of law became known as &quot;Common Law&quot;. This legal tradition is practiced in the English and American legal systems. In most civil law jurisdictions, courts function under an inquisitorial system. In the common law system, most courts follow the adversarial system. Procedural law governs the rules by which courts operate: civil procedure for private disputes (for example); and criminal procedure for violation of the criminal law. In recent years, international courts are being created to resolve matters not covered by the jurisdiction of national courts. For example, the International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, in the Netherlands, or the Court of Permanent Lok Adalat (Public Utility Services), based in India.

* &quot;Caso Cerrado&quot;
* &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot;
* &quot;Judge Alex&quot;
* &quot;Judge Joe Brown&quot;

<doc id="75359" wikidata="Q5530988" url="?curid=75359" title="Gender neutrality in English">
<text>Gender-neutral language is language that avoids assumptions about the social gender or biological sex of people referred to in speech or writing. In contrast to most other Indo-European languages, English does not retain grammatical gender and most of its nouns, adjectives and pronouns are therefore not gender-specific. In most other Indo-European languages, nouns are grammatically masculine (as in Spanish &quot;el humano&quot;) or grammatically feminine (as in French &quot;la personne&quot;), or sometimes grammatically neuter (as in German &quot;das Mädchen&quot;), regardless of the actual gender of the referent.

In addressing natural gender, English speakers use linguistic strategies that may reflect the speaker&#x27;s attitude to the issue or the perceived social acceptability of such strategies.

==Debate==
Supporters of gender-neutral language argue that making language less biased is not only laudable but also achievable. Some people find the use of non-neutral language to be offensive.

[There is] a growing awareness that language does not merely reflect the way we think: it also shapes our thinking. If words and expressions that imply that women are inferior to men are constantly used, that assumption of inferiority tends to become part of our mindset... Language is a powerful tool: poets and propagandists know this – as, indeed, do victims of discrimination.

The standards advocated by supporters of the gender-neutral modification in English have been applied differently and to differing degrees among English speakers worldwide. This reflects differences in culture and language structure, for example American English in contrast to British English.

===Support for===
Supporters of gender-neutral language argue that the use of gender-specific language often implies male superiority or reflects an unequal state of society. According to &quot;The Handbook of English Linguistics&quot;, generic masculine pronouns and gender-specific job titles are instances &quot;where English linguistic convention has historically treated men as prototypical of the human species.&quot; That masculine forms are used to represent all human beings is in accord with the traditional gender hierarchy, which grants men more power and higher social status than women.

Supporters also argue that words that refer to women often devolve in meaning, frequently developing sexual overtones.

&quot;The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing&quot; says that the words children hear affect their perceptions of the gender-appropriateness of certain careers (e.g. firemen vs firefighters). Men and women apply for jobs in more equal proportions when gender-neutral language is used in the advertisement, as opposed to the generic &quot;he&quot; or &quot;man&quot;. Some critics claim that these differences in usage are not accidental, but have been deliberately created for the purpose of upholding a patriarchal society.

=== Opposition ===
Various criticisms have been leveled against the use of gender-neutral language, most focusing on specific usages, such as the use of &quot;human&quot; instead of &quot;man&quot; and &quot;they&quot; instead of &quot;he&quot;. Opponents argue that the use of any other forms of language other than gender-specific language could &quot;lead one into using awkward or grating constructions&quot; or neologisms that are so ugly as to be &quot;abominations&quot;.

Opponents of gender-neutral language often argue that its proponents are impinging on the right of free expression and promoting censorship, as well as being overly accommodating to the sensitivities of a minority. A few commentators do not disagree with the usage of gender-neutral language, but they do question the effectiveness of gender-neutral language in overcoming sexism.

===In religion===

Much debate over the use of gender-neutral language surrounds questions of liturgy and Bible translation. Some translations of the Bible in recent years have used gender-inclusive pronouns, but these translations have not been universally accepted.

===Naming practices===

Some critics oppose the practice of women changing their names upon marriage, on the grounds that it makes women historically invisible: &quot;In our society &#x27;only men have real names&#x27; in that their names are permanent and they have &#x27;accepted the permanency of their names as one of the rights of being male.&#x27;... Essentially this practice means that women&#x27;s family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.&quot; Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to professions, they would be less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations. However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband&#x27;s surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations. Increasingly, studies have shown women&#x27;s decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women&#x27;s rights or marital roles, as often believed.

The practice of referring to married women by their husband&#x27;s first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the Reverend Samuel May &quot;moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee&quot; of the National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, Lucretia Mott quickly replied: &quot;Woman&#x27;s Rights&#x27; women do not like to be called by their husbands&#x27; names, but by their own&quot;. Elizabeth Cady Stanton refused to be addressed as &quot;Mrs Henry B. Stanton&quot;. The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of coverture, the idea that &quot;By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.&quot;

There is a tendency among scientists to refer to women by their first and last name and to men by their last name only. This may result in female scientists being perceived as less eminent than their male colleagues.

==Examples of gender neutral language==

===Job titles===

Gender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include &quot;firefighter&quot; instead of &quot;fireman&quot;; &quot;flight attendant&quot; instead of &quot;steward&quot; or &quot;stewardess&quot;; &quot;bartender&quot; instead of &quot;barman&quot; or &quot;barmaid&quot;; and &quot;chairperson&quot; or &quot;chair&quot; instead of &quot;chairman&quot; or &quot;chairwoman&quot;.

There are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or &quot;male&quot;) form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including &quot;man&quot;), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include &quot;actor&quot; and &quot;actress&quot;; &quot;usher&quot; and &quot;usherette&quot;; &quot;comedian&quot; and &quot;comedienne&quot;. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using &quot;comedian&quot; rather than &quot;comedienne&quot;, for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).

Terms such as &quot;male nurse&quot;, &quot;male model&quot; or &quot;female judge&quot; are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in &quot;my brother is a male nurse&quot;). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with &quot;lady&quot;, as in &quot;lady doctor&quot;: here &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;female&quot; is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender. Some jobs are known colloquially with a gender marker: washerwoman or laundress (now usually referred to as a laundry worker), tea lady (formerly in offices, still in hospitals), lunch lady (American English) or dinner lady (British English), cleaning lady for cleaner (formerly known as a charwoman or charlady), and so on.

===Generic words for humans===
Another issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words &quot;man&quot;, &quot;men&quot; and &quot;mankind&quot; to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.

Although the word &quot;man&quot; originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously. In Old English, the word &quot;wer&quot; referred to males only and &quot;wif&quot; to females only, while &quot;man&quot; referred to both, although in practice &quot;man&quot; was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males. In time, &quot;wer&quot; fell out of use, and &quot;man&quot; came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; &quot;[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.&quot; By the 18th century, &quot;man&quot; had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. Anthony Trollope, for example, writes of &quot;the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind&quot;, and when &quot;Edmund Burke, writing of the French Revolution, used &quot;men&quot; in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: &#x27;Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France...&#x27;&quot;

Proponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word &quot;man&quot; are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation:

As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth...

&quot;If &quot;man&quot; and &quot;he&quot; were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been &quot;he has difficulties in childbirth&quot;&quot;, Miller and Swift comment. Writing for the American Philosophical Association, Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word &quot;man&quot; would be perceived as &quot;false, funny, or insulting&quot;, offering as an example the sentence &quot;Some men are female.&quot;

Further, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender-neutral use of &quot;man&quot; has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women:

Thomas Jefferson did not make the same distinction in declaring that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and &quot;governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.&quot; In a time when women, having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be using the word &quot;men&quot; in its principal sense of &quot;males&quot;, and it probably never occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise.

For reasons like those above, supporters of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having &quot;man&quot; and &quot;men&quot; refer unambiguously to males, and &quot;human(s)&quot; or &quot;people&quot; to all persons; similarly, the word &quot;mankind&quot; replaced by &quot;humankind&quot; or &quot;humanity&quot;.

The use of the word &quot;man&quot; as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers.

===Pronouns===
Another target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine pronoun &quot;he&quot; (and its derived forms &quot;him&quot;, &quot;his&quot; and &quot;himself&quot;) to refer to antecedents of indeterminate gender. Although this usage is traditional, some critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority. The use of the generic &quot;he&quot; was approved in an Act of Parliament, the Interpretation Act 1850 (the provision continues in the Interpretation Act 1978, although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). On the other hand, in 1879 the word &quot;he&quot; in by-laws was used to block admission of women to the Massachusetts Medical Society.

Proposed alternatives to the generic &quot;he&quot; include &quot;he or she&quot; (or &quot;she or he&quot;), &quot;s/he&quot;, or the use of singular &quot;they&quot;. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. The use of &quot;he or she&quot; has been criticized for reinforcing the gender binary. Some see the use of singular &quot;they&quot; to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, &quot;they&quot;, &quot;their&quot; and &quot;them&quot; have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the Middle Ages, including by a number of prominent authors, such as Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, and Jane Austen. Linguist Steven Pinker goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular &quot;they&quot; are themselves incorrect:

Some style guides (e.g. APA) accept singular &quot;they&quot; as grammatically correct, while others reject it. Some, such as &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, hold a neutral position on the issue, and contend that any approach used is likely to displease some readers.

Research has found that the use of masculine pronouns in a generic sense creates &quot;male bias&quot; by evoking a disproportionate number of male images and excluding thoughts of women in non-sex specific instances. Moreover, a study by John Gastil found that while &quot;they&quot; functions as a generic pronoun for both males and females, males may comprehend &quot;he/she&quot; in a manner similar to &quot;he&quot;.

===Honorifics===
Proponents of gender-neutral language point out that while Mr is used for men regardless of marital status, the titles Miss and Mrs indicate a woman&#x27;s marital status, and thus signal her sexual availability in a way that men&#x27;s titles do not. The honorific &quot;Ms&quot; can be used for women regardless of marital status.

The gender-neutral honorific Mx ( &quot;mix&quot;, ) can be used in place of gendered honorifics to provide gender neutrality. Adoption of the honorific has been relatively rapid and thorough in the UK. In 2013, Brighton and Hove City Council in Sussex, England, voted to allow its use on council forms, and in 2014, The Royal Bank of Scotland included the title as an option. In 2015, recognition spread more broadly across UK institutions, including the Royal Mail, government agencies responsible for documents such as drivers&#x27; licenses, and several other major banks. In 2015, it was included in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

==Style guidance by publishers and others==
Many editing houses, corporations, and government bodies have official policies in favor of in-house use of gender-neutral language. One of the first was &quot;The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing: For writers, editors, and speakers&quot;, published in 1980; linguist Deborah Cameron argues that the work by Casey Miller and Kate Swift brought &quot;the issue of sexist language into the mainstream&quot;.

In some cases, laws exist regarding the use of gender-neutral language in certain situations, such as job advertisements. Different authorities have presented guidelines on whether and how to use gender-neutral, or &quot;non-sexist&quot; language. Several are listed below:

* The &quot;Publication Manual &quot; of the American Psychological Association has an oft-cited section on &quot;Guidelines to Reduce Bias in Language&quot;. 
* American Philosophical Association —published 1986
* The Guardian—see section &quot;gender issues&quot;
* Avoiding Heterosexual Bias in Language, published by the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns, American Psychological Association.

In addition, gender-neutral language has gained support from some major textbook publishers, and from professional and academic groups such as the American Psychological Association and the Associated Press. Newspapers such as the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; use gender-neutral language. Many law journals, psychology journals, and literature journals will only print articles or papers that use gender-inclusive language.

Employee policy manuals sometimes include strongly worded statements prescribing avoidance of language that potentially could be considered discriminatory. One such example is from the University of Saskatchewan: &quot;All documents, publications or presentations developed by all constituencies...&quot;shall be written&quot; in gender neutral and/or gender inclusive language.&quot;

In 1989 the American Bar Association&#x27;s House of Delegates adopted a resolution stating that &quot;the American Bar Association and each of its entities should use gender-neutral language in all documents establishing policy and procedure.&quot;

In 2015 the Union for Reform Judaism in North America passed a &quot;Resolution on the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People&quot; stating in part: &quot;THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union for Reform Judaism...[u]rges Reform Movement institutions to review their use of language in prayers, forms and policies in an effort to ensure people of all gender identities and gender expressions are welcomed, included, accepted and respected. This includes developing statements of inclusion and/or non-discrimination policies pertaining to gender identity and gender expression, the use when feasible of gender-neutral language, and offering more than two gender options or eliminating the need to select a gender on forms&quot;.

<doc id="75367" wikidata="Q860589" url="?curid=75367" title="Non-Newtonian fluid">
<text>In physics and chemistry, a non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid that does not follow Newton&#x27;s law of viscosity, that is, it has variable viscosity dependent on stress. In particular, the viscosity of non-Newtonian fluids can change when subjected to force. Ketchup, for example, becomes runnier when shaken and is thus a non-Newtonian fluid. Many salt solutions and molten polymers are , as are many commonly found substances such as custard, toothpaste, starch suspensions, corn starch, paint, blood, melted butter and shampoo.

Most commonly, the viscosity (the gradual deformation by shear or tensile stresses) of non-Newtonian fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history. Some non-Newtonian fluids with shear-independent viscosity, however, still exhibit normal stress-differences or other non-Newtonian behavior. In a Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is linear, passing through the origin, the constant of proportionality being the coefficient of viscosity. In a non-Newtonian fluid, the relation between the shear stress and the shear rate is different. The fluid can even exhibit time-dependent viscosity. Therefore, a constant coefficient of viscosity cannot be defined.

Although the concept of viscosity is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize the shear properties of a fluid, it can be inadequate to describe non-Newtonian fluids. They are best studied through several other rheological properties that relate stress and strain rate tensors under many different flow conditions—such as oscillatory shear or extensional flow—which are measured using different devices or rheometers. The properties are better studied using tensor-valued constitutive equations, which are common in the field of continuum mechanics.

For non-Newtonian fluid&#x27;s viscosity, there are pseudoplastic, plastic, and dilatant flows that are time-independent, and there are thixotropic and rheopectic flows that are time-dependent. Three well-known time-dependent non-newtonian fluids which can be identified by the defining authors are the Oldroyd-B model, Walters’ Liquid B and Williamson fluids.

Time-dependent self-similar analysis of the Ladyzenskaya-type model with a non-linear velocity dependent stress tensor was performed unfortunately no analytical solutions could be derived, however a rigorous mathematical existence theorem was given for the solution.

For time-independent non-Newtonian fluids the known analytic solutions are much broader.

==Types of non-Newtonian behavior==

===Summary===


===Shear thickening fluid===
The viscosity of a shear thickeningi.e. dilatant fluid appears to increase when the shear rate increases. Corn starch suspended in water (&quot;oobleck&quot;, see below) is a common example: when stirred slowly it looks milky, when stirred vigorously it feels like a very viscous liquid.

===Shear thinning fluid===
A familiar example of the opposite, a shear thinning fluid, or pseudoplastic fluid, is wall paint: The paint should flow readily off the brush when it is being applied to a surface but not drip excessively. Note that all thixotropic fluids are extremely shear thinning, but they are significantly time dependent, whereas the colloidal &quot;shear thinning&quot; fluids respond instantaneously to changes in shear rate. Thus, to avoid confusion, the latter classification is more clearly termed pseudoplastic.

Another example of a shear thinning fluid is blood. This application is highly favoured within the body, as it allows the viscosity of blood to decrease with increased shear strain rate.

===Bingham plastic===
Fluids that have a linear shear stress/shear strain relationship but require a finite yield stress before they begin to flow (the plot of shear stress against shear strain does not pass through the origin) are called Bingham plastics. Several examples are clay suspensions, drilling mud, toothpaste, mayonnaise, chocolate, and mustard. The surface of a Bingham plastic can hold peaks when it is still. By contrast Newtonian fluids have flat featureless surfaces when still.

===Rheopectic or anti-thixotropic===
There are also fluids whose strain rate is a function of time. Fluids that require a gradually increasing shear stress to maintain a constant strain rate are referred to as rheopectic. An opposite case of this is a fluid that thins out with time and requires a decreasing stress to maintain a constant strain rate (thixotropic).

==Examples==
Many common substances exhibit non-Newtonian flows. These include:

* Soap solutions, cosmetics, and toothpaste
* Food such as butter, cheese, jam, mayonnaise, soup, taffy, and yogurt 
* Natural substances such as magma, lava, gums, honey, and extracts such as vanilla extract
* Biological fluids such as blood, saliva, semen, mucus, and synovial fluid
* Slurries such as cement slurry and paper pulp, emulsions such as mayonnaise, and some kinds of dispersions

===Oobleck===
An inexpensive, non-toxic example of a non-Newtonian fluid is a suspension of starch (e.g., cornstarch/cornflour) in water, sometimes called &quot;oobleck&quot;, &quot;ooze&quot;, or &quot;magic mud&quot; (1 part of water to 1.5–2 parts of corn starch). The name &quot;oobleck&quot; is derived from the Dr. Seuss book &quot;Bartholomew and the Oobleck&quot;.

Because of its dilatant properties, oobleck is often used in demonstrations that exhibit its unusual behavior. A person may walk on a large tub of oobleck without sinking due to its shear thickening properties, as long as the individual moves quickly enough to provide enough force with each step to cause the thickening. Also, if oobleck is placed on a large subwoofer driven at a sufficiently high volume, it will thicken and form standing waves in response to low frequency sound waves from the speaker. If a person were to punch or hit oobleck, it would thicken and act like a solid. After the blow, the oobleck will go back to its thin liquid-like state.

===Flubber (slime)===
Flubber, also commonly known as slime, is a non-Newtonian fluid, easily made from polyvinyl alcohol–based glues (such as white &quot;school&quot; glue) and borax. It flows under low stresses but breaks under higher stresses and pressures. This combination of fluid-like and solid-like properties makes it a Maxwell fluid. Its behaviour can also be described as being viscoplastic or gelatinous.

===Chilled caramel topping===
Another example of non-Newtonian fluid flow is chilled caramel ice cream topping (so long as it incorporates hydrocolloids such as carrageenan and gellan gum). The sudden application of force—by stabbing the surface with a finger, for example, or rapidly inverting the container holding it—causes the fluid to behave like a solid rather than a liquid. This is the &quot;shear thickening&quot; property of this non-Newtonian fluid. More gentle treatment, such as slowly inserting a spoon, will leave it in its liquid state. Trying to jerk the spoon back out again, however, will trigger the return of the temporary solid state.

===Silly Putty===

Silly Putty is a silicone polymer based suspension that will flow, bounce, or break, depending on strain rate.

===Plant resin===

Plant resin is a viscoelastic solid polymer. When left in a container, it will flow slowly as a liquid to conform to the contours of its container. If struck with greater force, however, it will shatter as a solid.

===Quicksand===

Quicksand is a shear thinning non-Newtonian colloid that gains viscosity at rest. Quicksand&#x27;s non-Newtonian properties can be observed when it experiences a slight shock (for example, when someone walks on it or agitates it with a stick), shifting between its gel and sol phase and seemingly liquefying, causing objects on the surface of the quicksand to sink.

===Ketchup===
Ketchup is a shear thinning fluid. Shear thinning means that the fluid viscosity decreases with increasing shear stress. In other words, fluid motion is initially difficult at slow rates of deformation, but will flow more freely at high rates. Shaking an inverted bottle of ketchup can cause it to transition to a lower viscosity through shear thinning, making it easier to pour from the bottle.
===Dry granular flows===
Under certain circumstances, flows of granular materials can be modelled as a continuum, for example using the &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;I&quot;) rheology. Such continuum models tend to be non-Newtonian, since the apparent viscosity of granular flows increases with pressure and decreases with shear rate. The main difference is the shearing stress and rate of shear.

=== Radioactive waste vitrification ===
Important issue for non-Newtonian fluids is glass behavior during radioactive waste vitrification when special attention is given to viscosity of the molten multicomponent glass being described by Douglas-Doremus-Ojovan (DDO) model of viscosity of glasses and melts

<text>Walter Eduard Carl Koch (3 May 1880 – 21 November 1962) was a German pathologist best known for the discovery of &quot;Koch&#x27;s triangle&quot;, a triangular shaped area in the right atrium of the heart.

Born in Dortmund and educated in Freiburg im Breisgau and at the Kaiser Wilhelm Academy in Berlin, Koch obtained his doctorate in 1907 at Freiburg. As a military physician, he served at the pathological institute in Freiburg. Later on he worked in Berlin. Here he habilitated in general pathology and pathological anatomy in 1921. After being named a professor in 1922, he worked as head of department at Berlin&#x27;s Westend hospital.

<text>Karl-Otto Koch (; 2 August 1897 – 5 April 1945) was a mid-ranking commander in the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) of Nazi Germany who was the first commandant of the Nazi concentration camps at Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen. From September 1941 until August 1942, he served as the first commandant of the Majdanek concentration camp in occupied Poland, stealing vast amounts of valuables and money from murdered Jews. His wife, Ilse Koch, also participated in the crimes at Buchenwald.

==Life==

Koch was born in Darmstadt, Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, on 2 August 1897. His father worked in a local registrar&#x27;s office and died when Karl was eight years old. After completing elementary school in 1912, Koch attended Mittelschule and completed a commercial apprenticeship.

In 1916, he volunteered to join the Imperial German Army and fought on the Western Front until he was captured by the British. Koch spent the rest of the war as a prisoner of war and returned to Germany in 1919. As a soldier, he behaved well and was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class, the Observer&#x27;s Badge and the Wound Badge in Black. After World War I, Koch worked as a commercial manager, an authorized signatory and insurance agent and became unemployed in 1932 (he had served a prison sentence in 1930 for embezzlement and forgery). In 1931, he joined the Nazi Party and the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS).

==Service with the SS==

Koch served with several &quot;SS-Standarten&quot; (Thirty-fifth SS Regiment Kassel, SS Special Detachment Saxony). In 1934, he took command of the Sachsenburg Concentration Camp. Briefly, he was the officer in charge of the Esterwegen Concentration Camp guard unit, officer in charge of the preventive custody camp in the Lichtenburg Concentration Camp, and the adjutant at Dachau Concentration Camp. On 13 June 1935, he became commander of the Columbia concentration camp in Berlin-Tempelhof and, in April 1936, he was assigned to the concentration camp at Esterwegen. Four months later, he was assigned to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. By September 1937 he had advanced to SS-Standartenführer (colonel).

On 1 August 1937, he was given command of the new Buchenwald concentration camp. He remained at Buchenwald until September 1941, when he was transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp for POWs near Lublin, Poland. That was due largely to an investigation based on allegations of his improper behavior at Buchenwald, which included corruption, fraud, embezzlement, drunkenness, sexual offences and a murder. Koch commanded the Majdanek camp for only one year; he was relieved from his duties when 86 Soviet POWs escaped from the camp in August 1942. Koch was charged with criminal negligence and transferred to Berlin, where he worked at the SS Personnel Main Office and as a liaison between the SS and the German Post Office.

==Prosecution and death==

Koch&#x27;s actions at Buchenwald first caught the attention of SS-Obergruppenführer Josias, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, in 1941. While perusing the death list of Buchenwald, Hereditary Prince Josias had seen the name of Walter Krämer, a head hospital orderly at Buchenwald, which he recognized because Krämer had successfully treated him in the past. Hereditary Prince Josias investigated the case and found that Koch, as the Camp Commandant, had ordered Krämer and Karl Peix, a hospital attendant, killed as &quot;political prisoners&quot; because they had treated him for syphilis and he feared it might be discovered. Josias also received reports that a certain prisoner had been shot while attempting to escape, and discovered that in fact, the prisoner had been told to get water from a well some distance from the camp, then was shot from behind; he had also helped treat Koch for syphilis.

By that time, Koch had been transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland, but his wife, Ilse, was still living at the Commandant&#x27;s house in Buchenwald. Waldeck ordered a full-scale investigation of the camp by Georg Konrad Morgen, an SS officer who was an SS-judge in the SS Court Main Office. As a result of the investigation, more of Koch&#x27;s orders to kill prisoners at the camp were revealed, as well as embezzlement of property stolen from prisoners. The Kochs had used the massive Nazi apparatus to gain an enormous amount of wealth. The Kochs were both arrested in August 1943 to await trial by an SS court.

SS Judge Konrad Morgen formally indicted the Kochs on 17 August 1944, charging Karl Koch with the &quot;embezzlement and concealing of funds and goods in an amount of at least 200,000 RM,&quot; and the &quot;premeditated murder&quot; of three inmates—ostensibly to prevent them from giving evidence to the SS investigatory commission. Ilse was charged with the &quot;habitual receiving of stolen goods, and taking for her benefit at least 25,000 RM...&quot; 
The trial resulted in Koch being sentenced to death for disgracing both himself and the SS. Koch was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945 one week before American allied troops arrived to liberate the camp. 
Contrary to some claims, however, Karl&#x27;s body was not burned in the camp&#x27;s crematoria, as they had run short of coal and had stopped operating in mid-March 1945. Instead, his body was disposed of in an unknown location.

==Family==

Koch first married Käte Müller in 1924 and had one psychiatrically troubled son named Manfred; however, this marriage ended with divorce in 1931 due to his infidelity. On 25 May 1937, Koch married Ilse Koch (née Margarete Ilse Köhler), with whom he had a son and two daughters. Ilse became known later as &quot;The Witch of Buchenwald&quot; (&quot;Die Hexe von Buchenwald&quot;), usually rendered in English as &quot;The Bitch of Buchenwald.&quot; Though Ilse Koch never had any official job at Buchenwald or at any other concentration camp, many inmates alleged that she used the tacit authority she had as the commandant&#x27;s wife to abuse prisoners, or seek their punishment by the camp SS.

==Photo album of Sachsenhausen concentration camp==
More than 55 years after Koch&#x27;s execution, a private photo album of his was discovered in the FSB archives in Moscow. Koch received the album from his co-workers as a gift for his 40th birthday. The album documents the construction process of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. It consists of 460 photographs, including 200 neatly labeled photos — some with cynical remarks — of the creation of the camp in 1936 and 1937. The photos also depict the concentration camp personnel, and prisoners as they arrive in normal clothing and later appear for roll call with their heads shaved and dressed in prisoner uniforms.

<text>Ptolemy Philadelphus (, &quot;Ptolemaios Philadelphos,&quot; &quot;Ptolemy the brother-loving&quot;, August/September 36 BC – 29 BC) was a Ptolemaic prince and was the youngest and fourth child of Greek Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, and her third with Roman Triumvir Mark Antony.

==Biography==
===Early life and reign===
Ptolemy Philadelphus was of Greek and Roman heritage. His father Mark Antony summoned Cleopatra to a summit near Antioch, Syria (now a part of modern Turkey) in a place Plutarch locates as being situated between Beirut and Sidon, called Light, an unwalled village. If Plutarch is to be believed, Ptolemy Philadelphus was conceived during this meeting between roughly November and December 37 BC. William Woodthorpe Tarn believed his birth (presumably in Alexandria, Egypt) was between August–September 36 BC.

Ptolemy Philadelphus was named after the original Ptolemy II Philadelphus (the second Pharaoh of the Ptolemaic dynasty) and Cleopatra&#x27;s intention was recreating the former Ptolemaic Kingdom, which she herself received from Antony in the Donations of Antioch in 36 BC at this time with full approval from Octavian. Two years later in late 34 BC, at the Donations of Alexandria, part of her kingdom was granted to Ptolemy Philadelphus making him ruler of Syria, Phoenicia and Cilicia.

Having approved of Antony&#x27;s planned reorganization of the East in 36 BC, by 34 BC, their political situations had evolved and Octavian then used with potency the Donations of Alexandria in his propaganda war against Antony. Ultimately, the parents of Ptolemy Philadelphus were defeated by Caesar Octavian (future Emperor Augustus) during the naval battle at Actium, Greece in 31 BC. The next year, his parents committed suicide as Octavian&#x27;s legions invaded Egypt. Their tombs have never been found or mentioned, and some ancient sources mention they might have escaped Octavian and fled to the way of India through Red sea where Caesarion was also possibly sent.

===Capture and fate===
Octavian took him and his elder siblings Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II from Egypt to Roman Italy (&quot;Italia&quot;). Octavian celebrated his military triumph by parading the three orphans in heavy golden chains in the streets of Rome. The chains were so heavy that they could not walk, prompting reactions of sympathy from the Romans. Octavian gave these siblings to Octavia Minor, his second-eldest sister who was their father&#x27;s former wife.

The fate of Ptolemy Philadelphus is unknown. Plutarch states that the only child that Octavian killed out of Antony&#x27;s children was Marcus Antonius Antyllus, but the ancient sources make no mention of him after being taken to Rome with his surviving siblings. His sister Cleopatra Selene survived to adulthood and was married to Juba of Mauretania, a client king of the Roman empire. Through her, the Ptolemaic line intermarried back into the Roman nobility for many generations. If Ptolemy Philadelphus survived to adulthood, proof of his survival has not been found. Roller speculates that he may have died from illness in the winter of 29 BC.

<text>Pinewood Studios is a British film and television studio located in the village of Iver Heath, England. It is approximately west of central London.

The studio has been the base for many productions over the years from large-scale films to television programmes, commercials, and pop promos, including the &quot;James Bond&quot; and &quot;Carry On&quot; film franchises.

==History==
Pinewood Studios was built on the estate of Heatherden Hall, a large Victorian country house which was purchased by Canadian financier, and Member of Parliament (MP) for Brentford and Chiswick, Lt. Col. Grant Morden (1880–1932). He added refinements such as a ballroom, a Victorian-style Turkish bath, and an indoor squash court. Due to its seclusion, it was used as a discreet meeting place for high-ranking politicians and diplomats; the agreement to create the Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed there.

In 1934, building tycoon Charles Boot (1874–1945) bought the land and turned it into a country club. The ballroom was converted into a restaurant and many of the bedrooms became furnished suites.

===1930s===
In 1935, millionaire flour magnate J. Arthur Rank (1888–1972) went into partnership with Boot and they transformed the estate into a film studio. Boot based designs for the studio complex on the latest ideas being employed by film studios in Hollywood, California. Boot named the new studio Pinewood because &quot;of the number of trees which grow there and because it seemed to suggest something of the American film centre in its second syllable&quot;. Construction began in December of that year, with a new stage completed every three weeks. The studios were finished nine months later, having cost £1 million (approx. £ at prices). Five stages were initially completed and there was provision for an enclosed water tank capable of holding , which is still in use. In the years that followed, he also undertook further work on both the Pinewood Film Studios and the Denham Film Studios, both of which had by then become a part of the newly-formed Rank Organisation.

On 30 September 1936, the studio complex was officially opened by Dr Leslie Burgin, Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. The first film director to use the facilities was Herbert Wilcox, completing &quot;London Melody&quot; (1937) featuring Anna Neagle (his wife), portions of which had already been filmed at British and Dominions Imperial Studios in Elstree, before a fire there halted production. The first film to be made entirely at Pinewood was &quot;Talk of the Devil&quot; (1936), directed by Carol Reed.

There followed a prolific period of Pinewood and British film history, with Pinewood following the studios adopting the &quot;unit system&quot;, an American industry practice. That enabled several pictures to be filmed simultaneously and, ultimately, Pinewood achieved the highest output of any studio in the world.

===1940s===

During the Second World War, Pinewood was requisitioned, and the Crown Film Unit, No. 5 Army Film and Photographic Unit, Royal Air Force Film Production Unit, and Polish Air Force Film Unit were based there. The Crown Film Unit completed many classic wartime documentaries, and Roy Boulting&#x27;s &quot;Desert Victory&quot;, Humphrey Jennings&#x27; &quot;Fires Were Started&quot;, &quot;Coastal Command&quot; and Pat Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Western Approaches&quot; (all 1943) were filmed there during that period. As well its use by the armed forces, the Royal Mint and Lloyd&#x27;s of London were installed on sound stages at Pinewood, and were open for business for the duration of the war.

The Company of Youth, the Rank Organisation acting school, which launched several film careers, was founded in 1945. The next year, Pinewood re-opened for (non-war-related) business.

Two significant films produced at Pinewood were released within two months of each other in 1948: &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, directed by David Lean, and Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. Due to a shortfall in funds, brought about by financial overspends the previous year, Rank did not have enough money to market &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; sufficiently at first in the US, but it became Rank&#x27;s biggest earner up to that point, grossing over £1 million by 1951 (the equivalent of £ in terms).

In the same year, John Davis was appointed managing director. By the following year, Rank had run up an overdraft of £16 million (the equivalent of £ in ), and announced a loss of £3.5 million, mainly due to big budget flops. One of the largest of these had been &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; (1945), which was originally budgeted at £250,000, but which eventually cost £1,278,000 (the equivalent of £ in ).

===1950s===
The &quot;Doctor&quot; film series, produced by Betty Box and directed by Ralph Thomas, began with &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; (1954), the most successful film at the box-office of its year in Great Britain. All of the &quot;Doctor&quot; films, running until 1970, were shot at Pinewood. The &quot;Carry On&quot; franchise began in 1958, produced on behalf of Rank by Peter Rogers (who was married to Box), and directed by Gerald Thomas (brother of Ralph). The Norman Wisdom comedies, the last of which was released in 1966, were also filmed at the facility.

===1960s===

During the 1960s, Pinewood was no longer solely dependent on the Rank Organisation to fill its stages. &quot;Renters&quot; (producers hiring the sound stages for a film-by-film agreement) were using half of the stages as Pinewood turned into a four walls facility. The James Bond franchise began at Pinewood with the Terence Young directed &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962), and has continued to be based at the studios since then.

J. Arthur Rank (by then Lord Rank) retired as chairman in 1962 and was succeeded by John Davis, who had begun to move the Rank Organisation away from mass film production and towards more profitable and less risky businesses such as bingo and holidays.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, Pinewood studios were being used more for television programmes, including ITC Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;UFO&quot; (1970), &quot;The Persuaders!&quot; (1971), starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore, and &quot;&quot; (1975–1977). Major films shot at Pinewood included &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1971), &quot;Sleuth&quot; (1972), &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; (1973), &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), and the James Bond films &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971), &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; (1973), &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977).

===1980s===
Four James Bond movies, &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; (1981), &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983), &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; (1987), among several other large productions, such as &quot;Pink Floyd – The Wall&quot; (1982), &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), &quot;Krull&quot; (1983), &quot;Legend&quot; (1985), &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot; (1985) and Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; (1989), were all produced at Pinewood.
===1990s===
The 1990s saw large-scale productions, such as &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992), &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997), and &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; (1999) produced at the studios which kept Pinewood operating.

===2000s===
The Rank Group owned the studio until 2001, when it sold Pinewood for £62 million to a group led by Michael Grade and Ivan Dunleavy and financed by private equity group 3i, who held an 80% stake. The purchase of Shepperton Studios from a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, gave rise to the Pinewood Group, eventually comprising Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios, Teddington Studios, Pinewood Toronto Studios, Pinewood Indomina Studios, Pinewood Studio Berlin, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios, and a joint venture in the US with Pinewood Atlanta Studios.

In 2009, Pinewood and Shepperton received a BAFTA Award for their Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema.

===2010s===
The Pinewood Studios Group was subject to a hostile takeover approach in 2011. Manchester-based The Peel Group acquired a 73% stake, but Warren James Jewellers retained a 27% stake, so preventing a full takeover. In 2012 Financial Services Authority considered cancelling the stock market listing because nearly all the shares are held by two groups. In June 2016, five new stages and 10 new workshops were opened at Pinewood.

In 2019, the Walt Disney Studios announced a 10-year lease of most of the Pinewood Studios in September 2019, to start in 2020.

== Stages, studios and locations ==
The 007 Stage was originally built for the Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; (1977) and featured one of the largest water tanks in Europe. The stage was destroyed by fire in 1984; it was rebuilt four months later and renamed Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s 007 Stage in time for filming to commence on &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. Another fire on 30 July 2006 seriously damaged the stage, causing the roof to partly collapse. Construction of a new stage began on 18 September and was completed in under six months. Since then, the stage has accommodated large productions including &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot; (2010), &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008). The whole fishing village from &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; (2008) was built on the stage.

As well as the 007 Stage, which is the largest stage at any of the studios under The Pinewood Studios Group at , the studio has fifteen other stages ranging from just , to cater for productions of all sizes. One of those studios, the T Stage, is a specialist stage for both television and film productions and the Studios second largest stage at .

Pinewood Studios paid tribute to Richard Attenborough&#x27;s body of work by naming a purpose-built film and television stage after him. The Richard Attenborough Stage has an area of . In his absence because of illness, Lord Puttnam and Pinewood chairman Lord Grade officially unveiled the stage on 23 April 2012. Opposite it, is a post-production block named in honour of Stanley Kubrick.

The studio also has two specialist TV studios, named TV One and TV Two, complete with integral galleries, TV studio floors, TV lighting grids and SD or HD facilities. Both studios stand at just under .

Pinewood is situated on the old estate of Heatherden Hall which still stands today. The mansion, its gardens and other parts of the studios have been used in various productions over the years. &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960) shows people driving out through the main gate and has various shots in the studios (showing things behind the camera), offices and corridors. &quot;Return to the Edge of the World&quot; (1978) includes shots of director Michael Powell driving into the studio. The main gate (no longer used due to the construction of a purpose-built security entrance further along the road) also features in &quot;My Week with Marilyn&quot; (2011) when Eddie Redmayne greets Judi Dench. This film also contains many shots of the dressing-room corridors in the main make-up block. Heatherden Hall (converted to production offices) has appeared in several films: it was made to look fire-damaged and derelict for the children&#x27;s film &quot;The Amazing Mr Blunden&quot; (1972) and also appeared as the Indian residence of Governor Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot; (1969).

The studios have acres of backlots where large sets have been built, from castles to whole villages including the Baker Street set built for Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and Godric&#x27;s Hollow from the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series.

===Burnham Beeches and Black Park===
The proximity of the ancient woodland Burnham Beeches and Black Park to Pinewood (as well as to Shepperton and Bray studios) made Burnham Beeches a desirable filming location for productions being filmed at Pinewood. Burnham Beeches was used for &quot;Robin Hood Prince of Thieves&quot;, &quot;First Knight&quot;, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Fahrenheit 451&quot; at Black Park.

===Former===
====Pinewood Atlanta Studios====
The studios announced in April 2013 that its first film production facility in the United States would be located south of Atlanta at a complex consisting of in Fayette County, Georgia. Pinewood Atlanta is a joint venture between Pinewood and River&#x27;s Rock LLC, an independently managed trust of the Cathy family, founders of the Chick-fil-A fast-food chain.

In August 2019, Pinewood sold their shares in the Atlanta location. The studio officially ended its relationship with the location in October 2020 with the renaming of the studio to Trilith.

====Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios====
Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios is a studio complex located at a site in Iskandar Puteri, Johor, managed by The Pinewood Studios Group. It targets the Asia-Pacific region. Pinewood Shepperton plc entered into a strategic agreement with Khazanah Nasional Berhad, the investment holding arm of the Government of Malaysia in connection with the development of a new film and television studio facility in Iskandar Malaysia.

Construction began towards the end of 2010, with completion expected by the end of 2012. The facilities being built as part of the studio complex include of film stages, ranging from to . The first two at while the other two at . The biggest stage at will have a water tank for productions that require work on or under water.[1] There are 2 TV studios, each at .

In July 2019, Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios was rebranded to Iskandar Malaysia Studios and the affiliation with Pinewood Shepperton plc ended.

=== Water filming ===

Pinewood&#x27;s water filming facilities include the Underwater Stage, and an Exterior Tank backed with a green screen measuring x.

== Project Pinewood ==
In November 2007, Pinewood announced a £200m expansion plan, known as Project Pinewood. If would have included replicas of streetscapes and zones replicating locations from the UK, Europe and the United States. Planned zones include a college campus, Amsterdam, modern European housing, Venice, Lake Como, Paris, an amphitheatre, Prague, west coast American housing, warehousing and downtown New York sets, Chicago, Vienna, a castle, a UK canal, Chinatown and a London street market built. In addition it will also be used as residential housing, with the proposed creative community, expected to be in the region of 2000 and 2250, being integrated with the film locations. Following consultations with the local community the plans changed to reflect the community&#x27;s opinions and suggestions. However, the planning application was rejected by South Bucks District Council in October 2009, following a opposition campaign by local residents, who formed a &quot;Stop Project Pinewood&quot; group.

Pinewood appealed against the decision and a public inquiry commenced on 5 April 2011 and on 20 January 2012, it was announced that the appeal had been turned down. On 15 May 2013, local councillors in South Buckinghamshire rejected a pared down version of the expansion plans. The chief executive of the studios, Ivan Dunleavy, said he expected to appeal against the latest decision to the Secretary of State, Eric Pickles, who rejected the previous application, a year earlier. On 19 June 2014 it was reported that Pinewood Studios had received approval to go ahead with the multimillion-pound expansion plans which would see it rival Hollywood film sets.

==Enter the Pitch==
Pinewood Studios is one of the sponsors for the short film competition &quot;Enter the Pitch,&quot; also known as the Pitch, which launched in 2009. The Pitch is an online short film pitching competition that invites film makers to submit a project that takes inspiration from any story, character, or theme in the Bible. The top ten finalists are invited to Pinewood Studios, where they pitch their film to a panel of industry professionals. The person giving the best pitch wins an apprenticeship with industry professionals and is mentored on how to turn their pitch into a short film.

The inaugural Pitch winner was Simeon Lumgair&#x27;s &quot;Derelict&quot; (2009); the most recent was Oneikeh Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Five Thousand Stars&quot; (2020).

<text>Graphology is the analysis of handwriting in an attempt to determine the writer&#x27;s personality traits. Its methods and conclusions are not supported by scientific evidence, and as such it is considered to be a pseudoscience. 

Graphology has been controversial for more than a century. Although proponents point to positive testimonials as anecdotal evidence of its utility for personality evaluation, these claims have not been supported by scientific studies. It has been rated as among the most discredited methods of psychological analysis by a survey of mental health professionals.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;graphology&quot; derives from the Greek (; &#x27;writing&#x27;), and (; &#x27;theory&#x27;).

== History ==
In 1991, Jean-Charles Gille-Maisani stated that Juan Huarte de San Juan&#x27;s 1575 was the first book on handwriting analysis. In American graphology, Camillo Baldi&#x27;s from 1622 is considered to be the first book.

Around 1830, Jean-Hippolyte Michon became interested in handwriting analysis. He published his findings shortly after founding &quot;Société Graphologique&quot; in 1871. The most prominent of his disciples was Jules Crépieux-Jamin, who rapidly published a series of books that were soon published in other languages. Starting from Michon&#x27;s integrative approach, Crépieux-Jamin founded a holistic approach to graphology.

Alfred Binet was convinced to conduct research into graphology from 1893 to 1907. He called it &quot;the science of the future&quot; despite rejection of his results by graphologists.

French psychiatrist Joseph Rogues De Fursac combined graphology and psychiatry in the 1905 book .

After World War I, interest in graphology continued to spread in Europe and the United States. In Germany during the 1920s, Ludwig Klages founded and published his findings in (&quot;Journal for the Study of Mankind&quot;). His major contribution to the field can be found in .

Thea Stein Lewinson and J. Zubin modified Klage&#x27;s ideas, based upon their experience working for the U.S. government, publishing their method in 1942.

In 1929, Milton Bunker founded The American Grapho Analysis Society teaching graphoanalysis. This organization and its system split the American graphology world in two. Students had to choose between graphoanalysis or holistic graphology. While hard data is lacking, anecdotal accounts indicate that 10% of the members of International Graphoanalysis Society (IGAS) were expelled between 1970 and 1980.

Regarding a proposed correlation between biological sex and handwriting style, a paper published by James Hartley in 1989 concluded that there was some evidence in support of this hypothesis.

Rowan Bayne, a British psychologist who has written several studies on graphology, summarized his view of the appeal of graphology: &quot;[I]t&#x27;s very seductive because at a very crude level someone who is neat and well behaved tends to have neat handwriting&quot;, adding that the practice is &quot;useless... absolutely hopeless&quot;. The British Psychological Society ranks graphology alongside astrology, giving them both &quot;zero validity&quot;.

Graphology was also dismissed as a pseudoscience by the skeptic James Randi in 1991.

In his May 21, 2013 Skeptoid podcast episode titled &quot;All About Graphology&quot;, scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning reports:In his book &quot;The Write Stuff&quot;, Barry Beyerstein summarized the work of Geoffrey Dean, who performed probably the most extensive literature survey of graphology ever done. Dean did a meta-analysis on some 200 studies:

Dean showed that graphologists have unequivocally failed to demonstrate any validity or reliability of their art for predicting work performance, aptitudes, or personality. Graphology thus fails according to the standards which a genuine psychological test must pass before it can ethically be released for use on the public.

Dean found that no particular school of graphology fared better than any other. In fact, no graphologist of any kind was able to show reliably better performance than untrained amateurs making guesses from the same materials. In the vast majority of studies, neither group exceeded chance expectancy.

Dunning concludes:Other divining techniques like iridology, phrenology, palmistry, and astrology also have differing schools of thought, require years of training, offer expensive certifications, and fail just as soundly when put to a scientific controlled test. Handwriting analysis does have its plausible-sounding separation from those other techniques though, and that&#x27;s the whole &quot;handwriting is brainwriting&quot; idea — traits from the brain will be manifested in the way that it controls the muscles of the hand. Unfortunately, this is just as unscientific as the others. No amount of sciencey sounding language can make up for a technique failing when put to a scientifically controlled test.

== Use by employers ==
Although graphology had some support in the scientific community before the mid-twentieth century, more recent research rejects the validity of graphology as a tool to assess personality and job performance. Today it is considered a pseudoscience. Many studies have been conducted to assess its effectiveness to predict personality and job performance. Recent studies testing the validity of using handwriting for predicting personality traits and job performance have been consistently negative.

Measures of job performance appear similarly unrelated to the handwriting metrics of graphologists. Professional graphologists using handwriting analysis were just as ineffective as lay people at predicting performance in a 1989 study. A broad literature screen by King and Koehler confirmed that dozens of studies showing the geometric aspects of graphology (slant, slope, etc.) are essentially worthless as predictors of job performance.

===Additional specific objections===
* The Barnum effect (the tendency to interpret vague statements as specifically meaningful) and the Dr. Fox effect (the tendency for supposed experts to be validated based on likeability rather than actual skill) make it difficult to validate methods of personality testing. These phenomena describe the observation that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. See, for example, Tallent (1958). Non-individualized graphological reports give credence to this criticism.
* Effect Size: Dean&#x27;s (1992) primary argument against the use of graphology is that the effect size is too small. Regardless of the validity of handwriting analysis, the research results imply that it is not applicable for any specific individual, but may be applicable to a group.
* Vagueness: Some important principles of graphology are vague enough to allow significant room for a graphologist to skew interpretations to suit a subject or preconceived conclusion. For example, one of the main concepts in the theory of Ludwig Klages is (or &quot;form-level&quot;): the overall level of originality, beauty, harmony, style, &quot;etc.&quot; of a person&#x27;s handwriting—a quality that, according to Klages, can be perceived but not measured. According to this theory, the same sign has a positive or negative meaning depending on the subject&#x27;s overall character and personality as revealed by the &quot;form-niveau&quot;. In practice, this can lead the graphologist to interpret signs positively or negatively depending on whether the subject has high or low social status.

== Systems ==
Integrative graphology focuses on the strokes and their purported relation to personality. Graphoanalysis was the most influential system in the United States between 1929 and 2000.

Holistic graphology is based on form, movement, and use of space. It uses psychograms to analyze handwriting.

Four academic institutions offer an accredited degree in handwriting analysis:
* The University of Urbino, Italy: MA (Graphology)
* Instituto Superior Emerson, Buenos Aires, Argentina: BA (Graphology)
* Centro de Estudios Superiores (CES), Buenos Aires, Argentina: BA (Graphology)
* Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain: MA (Graphology)

== Vocabulary ==
Every system of handwriting analysis has its own vocabulary. Even though two or more systems may share the same words, the meanings of those words may be different. The technical meaning of a word used by a handwriting analyst, and the common meaning is not congruent. Resentment, for example, in common usage, means annoyance. In graphoanalysis, the term indicates a fear of imposition.

== Legal considerations ==

=== Hungary ===
A report by the Hungarian Parliamentary Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information says that handwriting analysis without informed consent is a privacy violation.

=== United States ===

==== Employment law====
A 2001 advisory opinion letter from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission responded to a question regarding &quot;whether it is legal to use an analysis of an applicant&#x27;s handwriting as an employment screening tool. You also ask whether it is legal to ask the applicant&#x27;s age and use of medications to allow for variants in his/her handwriting.&quot; The letter advised that in this circumstance, it was illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to ask a job applicant whether he or she is taking any medications, and also advised that asking an applicant for his or her age &quot;allegedly to allow for variants in analyzing his/her handwriting&quot; was not a &quot;per se&quot; violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), but could be significant evidence of age discrimination. The letter also said that there was no judicial guidance on &quot;whether a policy of excluding applicants based upon their handwriting has an adverse impact on a protected group&quot; under the ADA, ADEA, or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

== Applications ==

=== Gender and handwriting ===
A 1991 review of the then-current literature concluded that respondents were able to predict the gender of handwriting between 57 and 78% of the time. However, most of these samples, as well as subsequent studies, are based on small sample sizes that are collected non-randomly. A much larger and more recent survey of over 3,000 participants only found a classification accuracy of 54%. As statistical discrimination below 0.7 is generally considered unacceptable, this indicates that most results are rather inaccurate, and that variation in results observed is likely due to sampling technique and bias.

The reason for this bias varies; hypotheses are that biology contributes due to average differences in fine motor skills among males and females, and that differences arise from culture and gender bias.

=== Employment profiling ===
A company takes a writing sample provided by an applicant, and does a personality profile, supposedly matching the congruence of the applicant with the ideal psychological profile of employees in the position. The applicant can also malpractice in this system; they may ask someone to write on their behalf.

A graphological report is meant to be used in conjunction with other tools, such as comprehensive background checks, practical demonstration or record of work skills. Graphology supporters state that it can complement but not replace traditional hiring tools.

Research in employment suitability has ranged from complete failure to guarded
success. The most substantial reason for not using handwriting analysis in the employment process is the absence of evidence of a direct link between handwriting analysis and various measures of job performance.

The use of graphology in the hiring process has been criticized on ethical and legal grounds in the United States.

=== Psychological analysis ===
Graphology has been used clinically by counselors and psychotherapists. When it is used, it is generally used alongside other projective personality assessment tools, and not in isolation. It is often used within individual psychotherapy, marital counseling, or vocational counseling.

===Marital compatibility===
In its simplest form only sexual expression and sexual response are examined. At its most complex, every aspect of an individual is examined for how it affects the other individual(s) within the relationship. The theory is that after knowing and understanding how each individual in the relationship differs from every other individual in the relationship, the resulting marriage will be more enduring. With a comparative analysis receiving and non-receiving parts responses are measured.

=== Medical diagnosis ===
Medical graphology is probably the most controversial branch of handwriting analysis. Strictly speaking, such research is not graphology as described throughout this article but an examination of factors pertaining to motor control. Research studies have been conducted in which a detailed examination of handwriting factors, particularly timing, fluidity, and consistency of size, form, speed, and pressure are considered in the process of evaluating patients and their response to pharmacological therapeutic agents. The study of these phenomena is a by-product of researchers investigating motor control processes and the interaction of nervous, anatomical, and biomechanical systems of the body.

&quot;The Vanguard Code of Ethical Practice&quot;, amongst others, prohibits medical diagnosis by those not licensed to do diagnosis in the state in which they practice.

=== Graphotherapy ===

&quot;Graphotherapy&quot; is the pseudoscience of changing a person&#x27;s handwriting with the goal of changing features of his or her personality, or &quot;handwriting analysis in reverse.&quot; It originated in France during the 1930s, spreading to the United States in the late 1950s. The purported therapy consists of a series of exercises similar to those taught in basic calligraphy courses, sometimes in conjunction with music or positive self-talk.

<doc id="75392" wikidata="Q151130" url="?curid=75392" title="Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia">
<text>Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia (; – 17 July 1918) was the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II, the last sovereign of Imperial Russia, and his wife, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna.

Anastasia was the younger sister of Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, and Maria (commonly known together as the OTMA sisters) and was the elder sister of Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia. She was murdered with her family by a group of Bolsheviks in Yekaterinburg on 17 July 1918.

Persistent rumors of her possible escape circulated after her death, fueled by the fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of communist rule. The abandoned mine serving as a mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the acidified remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991. These remains were put to rest at Peter and Paul Fortress in 1998. The bodies of Alexei and the remaining daughter—either Anastasia or her older sister Maria—were discovered in 2007. Her purported survival has been conclusively disproven. Scientific analysis including DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family, showing that Anastasia was killed alongside her family.

Several women falsely claimed to have been Anastasia; the best known impostor was Anna Anderson. Anderson&#x27;s body was cremated upon her death in 1984; DNA testing in 1994 on pieces of Anderson&#x27;s tissue and hair showed no relation to the Romanov family.

==Biography==
=== Early years ===

Anastasia was born on 18 June 1901. She was the fourth daughter of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra. When she was born, her parents and extended family were disappointed that she was a girl. They had hoped for a son who would have become heir apparent to the throne. Her father went for a long walk to compose himself before going to visit his wife and their newborn child for the first time. Her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia said, &quot;My God! What a disappointment!... a fourth girl!&quot; Her first cousin twice removed Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich wrote, &quot;Forgive us, Lord, if we all felt disappointment instead of joy. We were so hoping for a boy, and it&#x27;s a daughter.&quot; The travel writer Burton Holmes wrote, &quot;Nicholas would part with half his Empire in exchange for one Imperial boy.&quot;

Anastasia was named for the fourth-century martyr St. Anastasia. &quot;Anastasia&quot; is a Greek name (Αναστασία), meaning &quot;of the resurrection&quot;, a fact often alluded to later in stories about her rumored survival. Anastasia&#x27;s title is most precisely translated as &quot;Grand Princess&quot;. &quot;Grand Duchess&quot; became the most widely used translation of the title into English from Russian.

The Tsar&#x27;s children were raised as simply as possible. They slept on hard camp cots without pillows, except when they were ill, took cold baths in the morning, and were expected to tidy their rooms and do needlework to be sold at various charity events when they were not otherwise occupied. Most in the household, including the servants, generally called the Grand Duchess by her first name and patronym, &quot;Anastasia Nikolaevna&quot;, and did not use her title or style. She was occasionally called by the French version of her name, &quot;Anastasie&quot;, or by the Russian nicknames &quot;Nastasya&quot;, &quot;Nastya&quot;, &quot;Nastas&quot;, or &quot;Nastenka&quot;. Other family nicknames for Anastasia were &quot;Malenkaya&quot;, meaning &quot;little (one)&quot; in Russian, or &quot;Shvybzik&quot;, meaning &quot;merry little one&quot; or &quot;little mischief&quot; in German.

Anastasia and her older sister Maria were known within the family as &quot;The Little Pair&quot;. The two girls shared a room, often wore variations of the same dress, and spent much of their time together. Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as &quot;The Big Pair&quot;. The four girls sometimes signed letters using the nickname OTMA, which derived from the first letters of their first names.

DNA testing on the remains of the imperial family proved conclusively in 2009 that Anastasia’s younger brother, Alexei, suffered from Hemophilia B, a rare form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Symptomatic carriers of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood-clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding. If Anastasia lived to have children of her own, it is genetically probable that they would have been afflicted by the disease.

===Appearance and personality===

Anastasia was short and inclined to be chubby, and she had blue eyes and blonde hair. Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden, her mother&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, reflected that &quot;her features were regular and finely cut. She had fair hair, fine eyes, with impish laughter in their depths, and dark eyebrows that nearly met.&quot; Buxhoeveden believed that Anastasia resembled her mother, saying that she &quot;was more like her mother&#x27;s than her father&#x27;s family. She was rather short even at seventeen, and was, then decidedly fat, but it was the fatness of youth. She would have outgrown it, as had her sister Marie.&quot;

Anastasia was a vivacious and energetic child. Margaretta Eagar, a governess to the four grand duchesses, said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child she had ever seen.

While often described as gifted and bright, she was never interested in the restrictions of the school room, according to her tutors Pierre Gilliard and Sydney Gibbes. Gibbes, Gilliard, and ladies-in-waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova described Anastasia as lively, mischievous, and a gifted actress. Her sharp, witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots. However, she was also very amusing: &quot;Even as a baby she had entertained grave old men, who were her neighbors at table, with her astonishing remarks.&quot;

Anastasia&#x27;s daring occasionally exceeded the limits of acceptable behavior. &quot;She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family, for in naughtiness she was a true genius&quot;, said Gleb Botkin, son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin, who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg. Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family&#x27;s Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that &quot;Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil&quot;, and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was less concerned about her appearance than her sisters. Hallie Erminie Rives, a best-selling American author and wife of an American diplomat, described how 10-year-old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long, white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house.

Despite her energy, Anastasia&#x27;s physical health was sometimes poor. The Grand Duchess suffered from painful bunions, which affected both of her big toes. Anastasia had a weak muscle in her back and was prescribed a massage twice per week. She hid under the bed or in a cupboard to put off receiving the massage. Anastasia&#x27;s older sister, Maria, reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils, according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, who was interviewed later in her life. The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria&#x27;s mother. Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene, like their mother.

===Association with Grigori Rasputin===

Her mother relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin, a Russian peasant and wandering &quot;starets&quot; or &quot;holy man,&quot; and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions. Anastasia and her siblings were taught to view Rasputin as &quot;Our Friend&quot; and to share confidences with him. In the autumn of 1907, Anastasia&#x27;s aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin. Anastasia, her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns. &quot;All the children seemed to like him,&quot; Olga Alexandrovna recalled. &quot;They were completely at ease with him.&quot; Rasputin&#x27;s friendship with the imperial children was evident in some of the messages he sent to them. In February 1909, Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram, advising them to &quot;Love the whole of God&#x27;s nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework.&quot;

However, one of the girls&#x27; governesses, Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva, was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred. Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future. The children were aware of the tension and feared that their mother would be angered by Tyutcheva&#x27;s actions. &quot;I am so afr(aid) that S.I. (governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva) can speak ... about our friend something bad,&quot; Anastasia&#x27;s twelve-year-old sister Tatiana wrote to their mother on 8 March 1910. &quot;I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now.&quot; 
Tyutcheva was eventually fired. She took her story to other members of the family. While Rasputin&#x27;s visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas&#x27;s sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on 15 March 1910, that she could not understand &quot;...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he&#x27;s only a &quot;khlyst&quot;!)&quot;

In the spring of 1910, Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova, a royal governess, claimed that Rasputin had raped her. Vishnyakova said the empress refused to believe her account of the assault, and insisted that &quot;everything Rasputin does is holy.&quot; Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova&#x27;s claim had been immediately investigated, but instead &quot;they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard.&quot; Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she made her accusation and was eventually dismissed from her post in 1913.

However, rumors persisted and it was later whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. This was followed by circulation of pornographic cartoons, which depicted Rasputin having relations with the Empress, her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova. After the scandal, Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra&#x27;s displeasure, and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine. Despite the rumors, the imperial family&#x27;s association with Rasputin continued until his murder on 17 December 1916. &quot;Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy &#x27;courses&#x27; for their age and their souls have much developed&quot;, Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on 6 December 1916.

In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared &quot;cold and visibly terribly upset&quot; by Rasputin&#x27;s death, and sat &quot;huddled up closely together&quot; on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov recalled that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse by Anastasia, her mother and her sisters. She attended his funeral on 21 December 1916, and her family planned to build a church over the site of Rasputin&#x27;s grave. After they were killed by the Bolsheviks, it was discovered Anastasia and her sisters were all wearing amulets bearing Rasputin&#x27;s picture and a prayer.

===Captivity during World War I and Russian Revolution===

During World War I, Anastasia, along with her sister Maria, visited wounded soldiers at a private hospital in the grounds at Tsarskoye Selo. The two teenagers, too young to become Red Cross nurses like their mother and elder sisters, played games of checkers and billiards with the soldiers and tried to lift their spirits. Felix Dassel, who was treated at the hospital and knew Anastasia, recalled that the grand duchess had a &quot;laugh like a squirrel&quot;, and walked rapidly &quot;as though she &quot;tripped&quot; along.&quot;

In February 1917, Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution. Nicholas II abdicated on . As the Bolsheviks approached, Alexander Kerensky of the Provisional Government had them moved to Tobolsk, Siberia, where they were housed in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. After the Bolsheviks seized majority control of Russia, Anastasia and her family were moved to the Ipatiev House, or House of Special Purpose, at Yekaterinburg.

The stress and uncertainty of captivity took their toll on Anastasia as well as her family. &quot;Goodby &quot;, she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917. &quot;Don&#x27;t forget us.&quot; At Tobolsk, she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor, filled with spelling mistakes, about &quot;Evelyn Hope&quot;, a poem by Robert Browning about a girl: &quot;When she died she was only sixteen years old ... Ther(e) was a man who loved her without having seen her but (k)new her very well. And she he(a)rd of him also. He never could tell her that he loved her, and now she was dead. But still he thought that when he and she will live [their] next life whenever it will be that ...&quot;, she wrote.

Upon arriving in Yekaterinburg, Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children:
&quot;The sailor Nagorny, who attended to Alexei Nikolaevitch, passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms, behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with valises and small personal belongings. I tried to get out, but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry. I came back to the window. Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise. It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step. Nagorny tried to come to her assistance; he was roughly pushed back by one of the commisars ...&quot;

Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden told of her sad last glimpse of Anastasia: &quot;Once, standing on some steps at the door of a house close by, I saw a hand and a pink-sleeved arm opening the topmost pane. According to the blouse the hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia. They could not see me through their windows, and this was to be the last glimpse that I was to have of any of them!&quot;

However, even in the last months of her life, she found ways to enjoy herself. She and other members of the household performed plays for the enjoyment of their parents and others in the spring of 1918. Anastasia&#x27;s performance made everyone howl with laughter, according to her tutor Sydney Gibbes.

On 7 May 1918, in a letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg, Anastasia described a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei: &quot;We played on the swing, that was when I roared with laughter, the fall was so wonderful! Indeed! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up, but I could go on telling it masses of times ... What weather we&#x27;ve had! One could simply shout with joy.&quot; In his memoirs, one of the guards at the Ipatiev House, Alexander Strekotin, remembered Anastasia as &quot;very friendly and full of fun&quot;, while another guard said Anastasia was &quot;a very charming devil! She was mischievous and, I think, rarely tired. She was lively, and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs, as though they were performing in a circus.&quot; Yet another of the guards, however, called the youngest grand duchess &quot;offensive and a terrorist&quot; and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks. Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House.

In the summer, the privations of the captivity, including their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family. On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family. They reported that Anastasia and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead, and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless, and no longer sang the replies in the service. Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit, one priest told the other, &quot;Something has happened to them in there.&quot; But the next day, on 15 July 1918, Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors. They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards were not watching. Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, when he momentarily turned his back and left the room.

===Death===
After the Bolshevik revolution in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations for the release of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as &#x27;Reds&#x27;) captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the Whites (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.

The &quot;Yurovsky Note&quot;, an account of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik superiors following the killings, was found in 1989 and detailed in Edvard Radzinsky&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;The Last Tsar&quot;. According to the note, on the night of the deaths, the family was awakened and told to dress. They were told they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg. Once dressed, the family and the small circle of servants who had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house&#x27;s sub-basement and told to wait. Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress&#x27;s request.

After several minutes, the guards entered the room, led by Yurovsky, who quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed. The Tsar had time to say only &quot;What?&quot; and turn to his family before he was killed by several bullets to the chest (not, as is commonly stated, to the head; his skull, recovered in 1991, bears no bullet wounds). The Tsarina and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross but were killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners. The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order, with the exception of Anna Demidova, Alexandra&#x27;s maid. Demidova survived the initial onslaught but was quickly stabbed to death against the back wall of the basement while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub-basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels.

The &quot;Yurovsky Note&quot; further reported that once the thick smoke that had filled the room from so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared, it was discovered that the executioners&#x27; bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses. The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family&#x27;s crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside the linings of the corsets to hide them from their captors. The corsets thus served as a form of &quot;armor&quot; against the bullets. Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall, covering their heads in terror, until they were shot down by bullets, recalled Yurovsky. However, another guard, Peter Ermakov, told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets. As the bodies were carried out, one or more of the girls cried out, and were clubbed on the back of the head, wrote Yurovsky.

==False reports of survival==
Anastasia&#x27;s supposed escape and possible survival was one of the most popular historical mysteries of the 20th century, provoking many books and films. At least ten women claimed to be her, offering varying stories as to how she had survived. Anna Anderson, the best known Anastasia impostor, first surfaced publicly between 1920 and 1922. She contended that she had feigned death among the bodies of her family and servants, and was able to make her escape with the help of a compassionate guard who noticed she was still breathing and took sympathy upon her. Her legal battle for recognition from 1938 to 1970 continued a lifelong controversy and was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts, where it was officially filed. The final decision of the court was that Anderson had not provided sufficient proof to claim the identity of the grand duchess.

Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated. DNA tests were conducted in 1994 on a tissue sample from Anderson located in a hospital and the blood of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a great-nephew of Empress Alexandra. According to Dr Gill who conducted the tests, &quot;If you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson, then Anna Anderson could not be related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra.&quot; Anderson&#x27;s mitochondrial DNA was a match with a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska, a missing Polish factory worker. Some supporters of Anderson&#x27;s claim acknowledged that the DNA tests proving she could not have been the Grand Duchess had &quot;won the day&quot;.

Other lesser known claimants were Nadezhda Ivanovna Vasilyeva and Eugenia Smith. Two young women claiming to be Anastasia and her sister Maria were taken in by a priest in the Ural Mountains in 1919 where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964. They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna.
Rumors of Anastasia&#x27;s survival were embellished with various contemporary reports of trains and houses being searched for &quot;Anastasia Romanov&quot; by Bolshevik soldiers and secret police. When she was briefly imprisoned at Perm in 1918, Princess Helena Petrovna, the wife of Anastasia&#x27;s distant cousin, Prince John Constantinovich of Russia, reported that a guard brought a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked if the girl was the daughter of the Tsar. Helena Petrovna said she did not recognize the girl and the guard took her away. Although other witnesses in Perm later reported that they saw Anastasia, her mother and sisters in Perm after the murders, this story is now widely discredited. Rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed to hide the fact that the family was dead. A few days after they had been murdered, the German government sent several telegrams to Russia demanding &quot;the safety of the princesses of German blood&quot;. Russia had recently signed a peace treaty with the Germans, and did not want to upset them by letting them know the women were dead, so they told them they had been moved to a safer location.

In another incident, eight witnesses reported the recapture of a young woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37, northwest of Perm. These witnesses were Maxim Grigoyev, Tatiana Sitnikova (and her son Fyodor Sitnikov), Ivan Kuklin and Matrina Kuklina, Vassily Ryabov, Ustinya Varankina, and Dr Pavel Utkin, a physician who treated the girl after the incident. Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators. Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl, whom he treated at Cheka headquarters in Perm, told him, &quot;I am the daughter of the ruler, Anastasia.&quot; Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named &quot;N&quot; at the orders of the secret police. White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription. During the same time period in mid-1918, there were several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees. Boris Soloviev, the husband of Rasputin&#x27;s daughter Maria, defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses to assist in deceiving the families he had defrauded.

Some biographers&#x27; accounts speculated that the opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a survivor existed. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies.

==Romanov graves and DNA proof==

In 1991, the presumed burial site of the imperial family and their servants was excavated in the woods outside Yekaterinburg. The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier, but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who were still ruling Russia at the time. The grave only held nine of the expected eleven sets of remains. DNA and skeletal analysis matched these remains to Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of the four grand duchesses (Olga, Tatiana and presumably Maria). The other remains, with unrelated DNA, correspond to the family&#x27;s doctor (Yevgeny Botkin), their valet (Alexei Trupp), their cook (Ivan Kharitonov), and Alexandra&#x27;s maid (Anna Demidova). Forensic expert William R. Maples found that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia&#x27;s bodies were missing from the family&#x27;s grave. Russian scientists contested this conclusion, however, claiming it was the body of Maria that was missing. The Russians identified the body as that of Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest grand duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave. They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing. American scientists found this method inexact.

American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, that they would have expected to find in a seventeen-year-old. In 1998, when the remains of the imperial family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5&#x27;7&quot; was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of her standing beside her three sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Anastasia was several inches shorter than all of them. Her mother commented on sixteen-year-old Anastasia&#x27;s short stature in a 15 December 1917 letter, written seven months before the murders. &quot;Anastasia, to her despair, is now very fat, as Maria was, round and fat to the waist, with short legs. I do hope she will grow.&quot; Scientists considered it unlikely that the teenager could have grown so much in the last months of her life. Her actual height was approximately 5&#x27;2&quot;.

The account of the &quot;Yurovsky Note&quot; indicated that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area in order to further disguise the burials of the Tsar and his retinue if the remains were discovered by the Whites, since the body count would not be correct. Searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children.

However, on 23 August 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky&#x27;s memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones were from a boy who was roughly between the ages of twelve and fifteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of fifteen and nineteen years old. Anastasia was seventeen years and one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was nineteen years, one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday. Anastasia&#x27;s elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty-two and twenty-one years old respectively at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found &quot;shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber&quot;. The site was initially found with metal detectors and by using metal rods as probes.

DNA testing by multiple international laboratories including the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory and Innsbruck Medical University confirmed that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, proving conclusively that all family members, including Anastasia, died in 1918. The parents and all five children are now accounted for, and each has his or her own unique DNA profile. While the tests have confirmed that all the Romanov bodies have been found, one of the studies was still unsure which body from the two graves was Maria&#x27;s and which was Anastasia&#x27;s:
a well publicized debate over which daughter, Maria (according to Russian experts) or Anastasia (according to US experts), has been recovered from the second grave cannot be settled based upon the DNA results reported here. In the absence of a DNA reference from each sister, we can only conclusively identify Alexei – the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra.

==Sainthood==
In 2000, Anastasia and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church. The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs. The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II, Tsarina Alexandra, and three of their daughters were finally interred in the St. Catherine Chapel at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, St Petersburg on 17 July 1998, eighty years after they were murdered. As of 2018 the bones of Alexei and Maria (or possibly Anastasia) were still being held by the Orthodox Church.

==Depictions in art, media, and literature==

The purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of cinema (such as the 1997 animated film and the 1956 film that inspired it starring Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brynner), made-for-television films, and a Broadway musical based on the 1997 animated film. The earliest, made in 1928, was called &quot;Clothes Make the Woman&quot;. The story followed a woman who turns up to play the part of a rescued Anastasia for a Hollywood film, and ends up being recognized by the Russian soldier who originally rescued her from her would-be assassins.

<text>The Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) is a political party in the U.S. state of Minnesota affiliated with the national Democratic Party. The party was formed by a merger between the Minnesota Democratic Party and the Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party in 1944. The DFL is one of two state Democratic Party affiliates with a different name from that of the national party, the other being the neighboring North Dakota Democratic–Nonpartisan League Party.

The DFL controls four of Minnesota&#x27;s eight U.S. House seats, both of its U.S. Senate seats, the Minnesota Senate, and all other statewide offices, including the governorship, making it the dominant party in the state. Its main political rival is the Republican Party of Minnesota.

==History==
During the 1930s, the Farmer–Labor Party had gained traction with radical platforms that challenged economic and social inequalities, backed by Governor Floyd B. Olson. However, by 1938, the party&#x27;s influence waned due to internal conflicts and accusations of incompetence and corruption, leading to a loss in gubernatorial elections.

On April 15, 1944, the Farmer–Labor Party merged with the Minnesota Democratic Party, forming the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). Leading the merger effort were Elmer Kelm, the head of the Minnesota Democratic Party and the founding chairman of the DFL; Elmer Benson, effectively the head of the Farmer–Labor Party by virtue of his leadership of its dominant left-wing faction; and rising star Hubert H. Humphrey, who chaired the Fusion Committee that accomplished the union and then went on to chair its first state convention. This merger marked a pivotal shift influenced by academic liberals at the University of Minnesota who advocated for integrating the New Deal&#x27;s progressive reforms within a more centralized, managerial political framework, transitioning from the movement-oriented politics of the Farmer-Labor party to a structure that emphasized interest-group pluralism.

During the post-war years, the DFL confronted various social issues, including antisemitism, which reflected broader national conversations about race and ethnicity. The DFL also navigated with its stance on civil rights and economic justice, influenced significantly by Minnesota&#x27;s small but politically active African American communities. In early 1946, as a Fair Employment Practice (FEPC) bill was moving through Congress, there was a surge of civil rights activism in the Twin Cities.

Factional battles were intensified by differing views on how to address the left-wing influence within the party, with significant conflicts between proponents of Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s progressive policies and the more moderate wing led by figures like Hubert Humphrey. By the party&#x27;s second convention in 1946, tensions had re-emerged between members of the two former parties. While the majority of delegates supported left-wing policies, Humphrey managed to install a more conservative, anti-communist ally, Orville Freeman, as party secretary. Some disaffected Farmer–Labor leaders such as Benson moved to the Progressive Party. Freeman was elected the state&#x27;s first DFL governor in 1954. Important members of the party have included Humphrey and Walter Mondale, who each went on to be United States senators, vice presidents of the United States, and unsuccessful Democratic nominees for president; Eugene McCarthy, a U.S. senator who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968 as an anti-Vietnam War candidate; Paul Wellstone, a U.S. senator from 1991 to 2002 who became an icon of populist progressivism; Amy Klobuchar, a U.S. senator who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020; Dean Phillips, a U.S. representative who ran for the Democratic nomination for president in 2024; and Tim Walz, two-term governor chosen as Kamala Harris&#x27; running mate in the 2024 presidential election. The DFL has had varied success beginning in the late 1970s and through the late 2010s, in part due to the growth of single-issue splinter groups after reforms brought by the national party.

Following the 2022 Minnesota elections, the DFL became the dominant party in the state, retaining every executive office, winning majorities in the state House and Senate, and re-electing all incumbent congressional representatives. With their newly elected trifecta, the DFL pursued a progressive agenda in their first legislative session. Governor Tim Walz described the session as &quot;the most successful legislative session, certainly in many of our lifetimes and maybe in Minnesota history.&quot; The newly elected government passed large expansions in welfare programs and spending. Notable policies passed include the expansion of abortion rights, new programs to provide reproductive healthcare, protection of gender affirming care, the legalization of recreational cannabis, indexing education spending to inflation, investments in public transit, and paid sick leave for Minnesota workers. Former president Barack Obama praised the state government&#x27;s actions, saying that &quot;Minnesota has made progress on a whole host of issues – from protecting abortion rights and new gun safety measures to expanding access to the ballot and reducing child poverty. These laws will make a real difference in the lives of Minnesotans.&quot;

== Party organization ==

The DFL is governed by a state central committee, which is composed of representatives from each of the state&#x27;s congressional districts. The state central committee is responsible for setting the party&#x27;s platform, electing party officers, and conducting other party business. The DFL also has a constitution and bylaws that govern its operations.

=== Community caucuses ===
The party operates several community caucuses that organize and represent different communities within Minnesota; they not defined geographically. These include the:

* African American Caucus, which organizes African Americans.
* Asian Pacific American Caucus, which organizes Asian Americans and Pacific Islander Americans.
* Disability Caucus, which advocates for Minnesotans with disabilities.
* Environmental Caucus, which advocates for environmental protection and sustainability.
* Feminist Caucus, which advocates for feminist and women&#x27;s issues.
* Hmong American Caucus, which organizes Hmong Americans, the largest Asian American group in Minnesota.
* Latino Caucus (Spanish: &quot;Movimiento&quot;) which organizes Latino Americans.
* Minnesota Young DFL, which organizes young people.
* Muslim Caucus, which organizes Muslims, who make up between 1–2% of the state.
* Native People&#x27;s Caucus, which organizes and supports Native Americans and tribal communities.
* Progressive Caucus, which advocates for progressive policies and opposes &quot;corporate money in politics&quot;.
* Rural Caucus, which supports the state&#x27;s rural communities.
* Senior Caucus, which advocates for the interests of senior citizens.
* Somali American Caucus, which organizes Somali Americans, who make up over 1% of the state&#x27;s population.
* Stonewall DFL, which organizes LGBTQ+ Minnesotans.
* Veterans Caucus, which organizes veterans and their families.

== Voter base ==
The DFL&#x27;s base of support is diverse, and it includes urban and suburban voters, working class voters, labor unions, environmentalists, and other progressive groups. The party has a strong presence in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The DFL has lost support in traditional DFL strongholds such as the Iron Range since 2016.

<doc id="75432" wikidata="Q667704" url="?curid=75432" title="Sweep picking">
<text>Sweep picking is a guitar-playing technique. When sweep picking, the guitarist plays single notes on consecutive strings with a &#x27;sweeping&#x27; motion of the pick, while using the fretting hand to produce a specific series of notes that are fast and fluid in sound. Both hands essentially perform an integral motion in unison to achieve the desired effect.

==History==
The technique was first used and developed by jazz guitarists Les Paul, Chet Atkins, Tal Farlow and Barney Kessel in the 1950s, as well as rock guitarists Jan Akkerman, Ritchie Blackmore and Steve Hackett in the 1970s. In the 1980s, sweep picking became widely known for its use by shred guitarists. Jazz fusion guitarist Frank Gambale released several books and instructional videos about the technique, of which the most well-known is &quot;Monster Licks &amp; Speed Picking&quot; in 1988.

==Application==
Guitarists often use the technique to play arpeggios at high speed. A common fretting shape is the one- or two-octave stacked triad. In scalar terms, this is the first (tonic), third (mediant) and fifth (dominant) of a scale, played twice, with an additional tonic added at the high end. For example, an A minor stacked triad is A-C-E-A-C-E-A. When the guitarist plays such a series of notes quickly up and down as an arpeggio, the phrasing sounds typical of pianos and other instruments more associated with such arpeggios. Unlike pianos, woodwinds, and many other instruments, the guitarist can change key by moving the same arpeggio shape up and down the fretboard.

Compared to other techniques, such as alternate picking, sweep picking requires few strokes. In some instances, however, a guitarist uses hammer-ons and pull-offs to produce a legato sound instead of actual pick strokes. This applies when a certain string must sound two notes in the shape due to the natural limits of a fretted string instrument.

However, as with all guitar techniques, individual players may integrate sweep picking into existing repertoire and use it in an individually stylistic manner. Therefore, some guitarists use legato techniques and others double-pick multiple notes on a single string. A guitarist may continue a sweep to the next note by tapping to play passing notes outside the classic arpeggio. Sweep picking is not limited to a few note patterns. Guitarists can construct as many patterns as there are chords, and apply sweep picking to any idea—arpeggio or otherwise. These are separate yet related techniques that produce obvious differences in legato versus struck notes, as well as shift in the timing of the entire arpeggio. Furthering the idea, most players who master the basic sweep picking pattern use only parts of it, or alter the technique to achieve a certain lick. In this sense, sweep picking is not so much a concrete action such as the aforementioned alternate picking, but instead is a technical idea with many possible applications in all genres of music.

<text>Windows 98 is a consumer-oriented operating system developed by Microsoft as part of its Windows 9x family of Microsoft Windows operating systems. It was the second operating system in the 9x line, as the successor to Windows 95. It was released to manufacturing on May 15, 1998, and generally to retail on June 25, 1998. Like its predecessor, it is a hybrid 16-bit and 32-bit monolithic product with the boot stage based on MS-DOS.

Windows 98 is web-integrated and bears numerous similarities to its predecessor. Most of its improvements were cosmetic or designed to improve the user experience, but there were also a handful of features introduced to enhance system functionality and capabilities, including improved USB support and accessibility, and support for hardware advancements such as DVD players. Windows 98 was the first edition of Windows to adopt the Windows Driver Model, and introduced features that would become standard in future generations of Windows, such as Disk Cleanup, Windows Update, multi-monitor support, and Internet Connection Sharing.

Microsoft had marketed Windows 98 as a &quot;tune-up&quot; to Windows 95, rather than an entirely improved next generation of Windows.

Upon release, Windows 98 was generally well-received for its web-integrated interface and ease of use, as well as its addressing of issues present in Windows 95, although some pointed out that it was not significantly more stable than Windows 95.

Windows 98 sold an estimated 58 million licenses and saw one major update, known as Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), released on June 10, 1999.

After the release of its successor, Windows Me in 2000, mainstream support for Windows 98 and 98 SE ended on June 30, 2002, followed by extended support on July 11, 2006 along with Windows Me&#x27;s end of extended support.

==Development==
Following the success of Windows 95, the development of Windows 98 began, initially under the development codename &quot;Memphis&quot;. The first test version, Windows Memphis Developer Release, was released in January 1997.

Memphis first entered beta as Windows Memphis Beta 1, released on June 30, 1997. It was followed by Windows 98 Beta 2, which dropped the Memphis name and was released in July. Microsoft had planned a full release of Windows 98 for the first quarter of 1998, along with a Windows 98 upgrade pack for Windows 95, but it also had a similar upgrade for Windows 3.x operating systems planned for the second quarter. Stacey Breyfogle, a product manager for Microsoft, explained that the later release of the upgrade for Windows 3 was because the upgrade required more testing than that for Windows 95 due to the presence of more compatibility issues, and without user objections, Microsoft merged the two upgrade packs into one and set all of their release dates to the second quarter.

On December 15, 1997, Microsoft released Windows 98 Beta 3. It was the first build to be able to upgrade from Windows 3.1x, and introduced new startup and shutdown sounds. Near its completion, Windows 98 Release Candidate was released on April 3, 1998, which expired on December 31 of the same year. This coincided with a notable press demonstration at COMDEX that month. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was highlighting the operating system&#x27;s ease of use and enhanced support for Plug and Play (PnP). However, when presentation assistant Chris Capossela plugged a USB scanner in, the operating system crashed, displaying a Blue Screen of Death. Bill Gates remarked after derisive applause and cheering from the audience, &quot;That must be why we&#x27;re not shipping Windows 98 yet.&quot; Video footage of this event became a popular Internet phenomenon.

Build 1998 was compiled as Windows 98 on May 11, 1998, before being fully released to manufacturing on May 15. The company was facing pending legal action for allowing free downloads of, and planning to ship Windows licenses with, Internet Explorer 4.0 in an alleged effort to expand its software monopoly. Microsoft&#x27;s critics believed the lawsuit would further delay Windows 98&#x27;s public release; it did not, and the operating system was released on June 25, 1998.

A second major version of the operating system called Windows 98 Second Edition was later unveiled in March 1999. Microsoft compiled the final build on April 23, 1999, before being fully released to manufacturing on May 5, and publicly released on June 10, 1999. Windows 98 was to be the final product in the Windows 9x line until Microsoft briefly revived the line to release Windows Me in 2000 as the final Windows 9x product before the introduction of Windows XP in 2001, which was based on the Windows NT architecture and kernel used in Windows 2000.

==New and updated features==

===Web integration and shell enhancements===
The first release of Windows 98 included Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1. This was updated to 5.0 in the Second Edition. Besides Internet Explorer, many other Internet companion applications are included such as Outlook Express, Windows Address Book, FrontPage Express, Microsoft Chat, Personal Web Server and a Web Publishing Wizard, and NetShow. NetMeeting allows multiple users to hold conference calls and work with each other on a document.

The Windows 98 shell is web-integrated; it contains deskbands, Active Desktop, Channels, ability to minimize foreground windows by clicking their button on the taskbar, single-click launching, Back and Forward navigation buttons, favorites, and address bar in Windows Explorer, image thumbnails, folder infotips and Web view in folders, and folder customization through HTML-based templates. The taskbar supports customizable toolbars designed to speed up access to the Web or the user&#x27;s desktop; these toolbars include an Address Bar and Quick Launch. With the Address Bar, the user accesses the Web by typing in a URL, and Quick Launch contains shortcuts or buttons that perform system functions such as switching between windows and the desktop with the Show Desktop button. Another feature of this new shell is that dialog boxes show up in the Alt-Tab sequence.

Windows 98 also integrates shell enhancements, themes and other features from Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 such as DriveSpace 3, Compression Agent, Dial-Up Networking Server, Dial-Up Scripting Tool and Task Scheduler. Windows 98 had its own separately purchasable Plus! pack, called Plus! 98.

Title bars of windows and dialog boxes support two-color gradients, a feature ported from and refined from Microsoft Office 95. Windows menus and tooltips support slide animation. Windows Explorer in Windows 98, as in Windows 95, converts all-uppercase filenames to sentence case for readability purposes; however, it also provides an option &quot;Allow all uppercase names&quot; to display them in their original case. Windows Explorer includes support for compressed CAB files. The &quot;Quick Res&quot; and &quot;Telephony Location Manager&quot; Windows 95 PowerToys are integrated into the core operating system.

===Improvements to hardware support===

====Windows Driver Model====

Windows 98 was the first operating system to use the Windows Driver Model (WDM). This fact was not well publicized when Windows 98 was released, and most hardware producers continued to develop drivers for the older VxD driver standard, which Windows 98 supported for compatibility&#x27;s sake. The WDM standard only achieved widespread adoption years later, mostly through Windows 2000 and Windows XP, as they were not compatible with the older VxD standard. With the Windows Driver Model, developers could write drivers that were compatible with other versions of Windows. Device driver access in WDM is implemented through a VxD device driver, codice_1, which implements several Windows NT-specific kernel support functions.

Support for WDM audio enables digital mixing, routing and processing of simultaneous audio streams, and kernel streaming with high-quality sample rate conversion on Windows 98. WDM Audio allows for software emulation of legacy hardware to support MS-DOS games, DirectSound support, and MIDI wavetable synthesis. The Windows 95 11-device limitation for MIDI devices is eliminated. A Microsoft GS Wavetable Synthesizer licensed from Roland shipped with Windows 98 for WDM audio drivers. Windows 98 supports digital playback of audio CDs, and the Second Edition improves WDM audio support by adding DirectSound hardware mixing and DirectSound 3D hardware abstraction, DirectMusic kernel support, KMixer sample-rate conversion for capture streams, and multichannel audio support. All audio is sampled by the Kernel Mixer to a fixed sampling rate, which may result in some audio getting upsampled or downsampled and having a high latency, except when using Kernel Streaming or third-party audio paths like ASIO which allow unmixed audio streams and lower latency. Windows 98 also includes a WDM streaming class driver (&quot;Stream.sys&quot;) to address real time multimedia data stream processing requirements and a WDM kernel-mode video transport for enhanced video playback and capture.

Windows Driver Model also includes Broadcast Driver Architecture, the backbone for TV technologies support in Windows. WebTV for Windows utilized BDA to allow viewing television on the computer if a compatible TV tuner card is installed. TV listings could be updated from the Internet and WaveTop Data Broadcasting allowed extra data about broadcasts to be received via regular television signals using an antenna or cable, by embedding data streams into the vertical blanking interval portion of existing broadcast television signals.

====Other device support improvements====
Windows 98 had more robust USB support than Windows 95, which only had support in OEM versions OSR2.1 and later. Windows 98 supports USB hubs, USB scanners and imaging class devices. Windows 98 also introduced built-in support for some USB Human Interface Device class (USB HID) and PID class devices such as USB mice, keyboards, force feedback joysticks etc. including additional keyboard functions through a certain number of Consumer Page HID controls. Windows 98 also supports UDMA, 3DNow! and SSE.

Windows 98 introduced ACPI 1.0 support which enabled &quot;Standby&quot; and &quot;Hibernate&quot; states. However, hibernation support was extremely limited and vendor-specific. Hibernation was only available if compatible (PnP) hardware and BIOS are present, and the hardware manufacturer or OEM supplied ACPI-compatible drivers. However, there are hibernation issues with the FAT32 file system, making hibernation problematic and unreliable.

Windows 98, in general, provides improved — and a broader range of — support for IDE and SCSI drives and drive controllers, floppy drive controllers and all other classes of hardware as compared to Windows 95.&lt;ref name=&quot;98I/O&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There is integrated Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) support (although the USB Supplement to Windows 95 OSR2 and later releases of Windows 95 did have AGP support). Windows 98 has built-in DVD support and UDF 1.02 read support. The Still imaging architecture (STI) with TWAIN support was introduced for scanners and cameras and Image Color Management 2.0 for devices to perform color space transformations. Multiple monitor support allows using up to nine multiple monitors on a single PC, with the feature requiring one PCI graphics adapter per monitor. Windows 98 shipped with DirectX 5.2, which notably included DirectShow. Windows 98 Second Edition would later ship with DirectX 6.1.

===Networking enhancements===

Windows 98 networking enhancements to TCP/IP include built-in support for Winsock 2, SMB signing, a new IP Helper API, Automatic Private IP Addressing (also known as link-local addressing), IP multicasting, and performance enhancements for high-speed high bandwidth networks. Multihoming support with TCP/IP is improved and includes RIP listener support.

The DHCP client has been enhanced to include address assignment conflict detection and longer timeout intervals. NetBT configuration in the WINS client has been improved to continue persistently querying multiple WINS servers if it failed to establish the initial session until all of the WINS servers specified have been queried or a connection is established.

Network Driver Interface Specification 5 support means Windows 98 can support a wide range of network media, including Ethernet, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Token Ring, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), ISDN, wide area networks, X.25, and Frame Relay. Additional features include NDIS power management, support for quality of service, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and support for a single INF file format across all Windows versions.

Windows 98 Dial-Up Networking supports PPTP tunneling, support for ISDN adapters, multilink support, and connection-time scripting to automate non-standard login connections. Multilink channel aggregation enables users to combine all available dial-up lines to achieve higher transfer speeds. PPP connection logs can show actual packets being passed and Windows 98 allows PPP logging per connection. The Dial-Up Networking improvements are also available in Windows 95 OSR2 and are downloadable for earlier Windows 95 releases.

For networked computers that have user profiles enabled, Windows 98 introduces Microsoft Family Logon which lists all users that have been configured for that computer, enabling users to simply select their names from a list rather than having to type them in.

Windows 98 supports IrDA 3.0 which specifies both Serial Infrared Devices and Fast Infrared devices, which are capable of sending and receiving data at 4 Mbit/s. Infrared Recipient, a new application for transferring files through an infrared connection is included. The IrDA stack in Windows 98 supports networking profiles over the IrCOMM kernel-mode driver. Windows 98 also has built-in support for browsing Distributed File System trees on Server Message Block shares such as Windows NT servers.

UPnP and NAT traversal APIs can be installed on Windows 98 by installing the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard. An L2TP/IPsec VPN client can also be downloaded. By installing Active Directory Client Extensions, Windows 98 can take advantage of several Windows 2000 Active Directory features.

===Improvements to the system and built-in utilities===

====Performance improvements====
Windows 95 introduced the 32-bit, protected-mode cache driver VCACHE (replacing SMARTDrv) to cache the most recently accessed information from the hard drive in memory, divided into chunks. However, the cache parameters needed manual tuning as it degraded performance by consuming too much memory and not releasing it quickly enough, forcing paging to occur far too early. The Windows 98 VCACHE cache size management for disk and network access, CD-ROM access and paging is more dynamic compared to Windows 95, resulting in no tuning being required for cache parameters. On the FAT32 file system, Windows 98 has a performance feature called MapCache that can run applications from the disk cache itself if the code pages of executable files are aligned/mapped on 4K boundaries, instead of copying them to virtual memory. This results in more memory being available to run applications, and lesser usage of the swap file.

Windows 98 registry handling is more robust than Windows 95 to avoid corruption and there are several enhancements to eliminate limitations and improve registry performance. The Windows 95 registry key size limitation of 64 KB is gone. The registry uses less memory and has better caching.

Disk Defragmenter has been improved to rearrange program files that are frequently used to a hard disk region optimized for program start. Despite this, the quirk of the hard drive being rescanned if the contents of the hard drive had changed (denoted by the message &quot;Drive contents changed...restarting.&quot;) is still present in this version, remaining identical to that of Windows 95. If it gets stuck on the same area too many times, it will ask the user if it should keep trying or give up. This quirk was removed with Windows Me&#x27;s version of Disk Defragmenter and will function on Windows 98 or Windows 95 if the user simply copies it over.

Windows 98 also supports a &quot;Fast Shutdown&quot; feature that initiates shutdown without uninitializing device drivers. However, this can cause Windows 98 to hang instead of shutting down the computer if a buggy driver is active, so Microsoft supplied instructions for disabling the feature. Windows 98 supports write-behind caching for removable disk drives. A utility for converting FAT16 partitions to FAT32 without formatting the partition is also included, however it is not compatible with DriveSpace.

===Other system tools===
A number of improvements are made to various other system tools and accessories in Windows 98. Microsoft Backup supports differential backup and SCSI tape devices in Windows 98. Disk Cleanup, a new tool, enables users to clear their disks of unnecessary files. Cleanup locations are extensible through Disk Cleanup handlers. Disk Cleanup can be automated for regular silent cleanups.

Scanreg (DOS) and ScanRegW are Registry Checker tools used to back up, restore or optimize the Windows registry. ScanRegW tests the registry&#x27;s integrity and saves a backup copy each time Windows successfully boots. The maximum number of copies could be customized by the user through &quot;scanreg.ini&quot; file. The restoration of a registry that causes Windows to fail to boot can only be done from DOS mode using ScanReg.

System Configuration Utility is a new system utility used to disable programs and services that are not required to run the computer. A Maintenance Wizard is included that schedules and automates ScanDisk, Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup. Windows Script Host, with VBScript and JScript engines is built-in and upgradeable to version 5.6. System File Checker checks installed versions of system files to ensure they were the same version as the one installed with Windows 98 or newer. Corrupt or older versions are replaced by the correct versions. This tool was introduced to resolve the DLL hell issue and was replaced in Windows Me by System File Protection.

Windows 98 Setup simplifies installation, reducing the bulk of user input required. The Windows 98 Startup Disk contains generic, real-mode ATAPI and SCSI CD-ROM drivers that can be used instead in the event that the specific driver for a CD-ROM is unavailable.

The system could be updated using Windows Update. A utility to automatically notify the user of critical updates was later released.

Windows 98 includes an improved version of the Dr. Watson utility that collects and lists comprehensive information such as running tasks, startup programs with their command line switches, system patches, kernel driver, user drivers, DOS drivers and 16-bit modules. With Dr. Watson loaded in the system tray, whenever a software fault occurs (general protection fault, hang, etc.), Dr. Watson will intercept it and indicate what software crashed and its cause.

Windows Report Tool takes a snapshot of system configuration and lets users submit a manual problem report along with system information to technicians. It has e-mail confirmation for submitted reports.

====Accessories====
Windows 98 includes Microsoft Magnifier, Accessibility Wizard and Microsoft Active Accessibility 1.1 API (upgradeable to MSAA 2.0.) A new HTML Help system with 15 Troubleshooting Wizards was introduced to replace WinHelp.

Users can configure the font in Notepad. Microsoft Paint supports GIF transparency. HyperTerminal supports a TCP/IP connection method, which allows it to be used as a Telnet client. Imaging for Windows is updated. System Monitor—used to track the performance of hardware and software—supports output to a log file.

====Miscellaneous improvements====
* Telephony API (TAPI) 2.1
* DCOM version 1.2
* Ability to list fonts by similarity determined using PANOSE information.
* Tools to automate setup, such as Batch 98 and INFInst.exe, support error-checking, gathering information automatically to create an INF file directly from a machine&#x27;s registry, customizing IE4, shell and desktop settings and adding custom drivers.
* Several other Resource Kit tools are included on the Windows 98 CD.
* Windows 98 has new system event sounds for &quot;Low Battery Alarm&quot; and &quot;Critical Battery Alarm&quot;.
* Windows 98 also introduced new and updated system sounds. The new startup sound for Windows 98 was composed by Microsoft sound engineer Ken Kato, who considered it to be a &quot;tough act to follow&quot;.
* Windows 98 shipped with Flash Player and Shockwave Player preinstalled.

==Windows 98 Second Edition ==

Windows 98 Second Edition (often shortened to Windows 98 SE and sometimes to Win98 SE or 98 SE) is an updated version of Windows 98 released on June 10, 1999, about eight months before the release of the business-oriented Windows 2000. It includes many bug fixes, improved WDM audio and modem support, improved USB support, added SSE2 support, the replacement of Internet Explorer 4.0 with Internet Explorer 5.0, &quot;Web Folders&quot; (WebDAV namespace extension for Windows Explorer), and related shell updates. Also included is basic OHCI-compliant FireWire DV camcorder support (MSDV class driver) and SBP-2 support for mass storage class devices. Wake-On-LAN reenables suspended networked computers due to network activity, and Internet Connection Sharing allows multiple networked client computers to share an Internet connection via a single host computer.

Other features in the update include DirectX 6.1 which introduced major improvements to DirectSound and the introduction of DirectMusic, improvements to Asynchronous Transfer Mode support (IP/ATM, PPP/ATM and WinSock 2/ATM support), Windows Media Player 6.1 replacing the older Media Player 4.1, Microsoft NetMeeting 3.0, MDAC 2.1 and WMI. A memory overflow issue was resolved in which earlier versions of Windows 98 would crash most systems if left running for 49.7 days (equal to 232 milliseconds); this bug was also present on its predecessor, Windows 95. Windows 98 SE could be obtained as retail upgrade and full version packages, as well as OEM and a Second Edition Updates Disc for existing Windows 98 users. USB audio device class support is present from Windows 98 SE onwards. Windows 98 Second Edition improved WDM support in general for all devices, and it introduced support for WDM for modems (and therefore USB modems and virtual COM ports). However, Microsoft driver support for both USB printers and USB mass-storage device class is not available for Windows 98.

===Removed features===
The Active Channels Channel bar from the original release of Windows 98 was removed in Windows 98 Second Edition and is not installed upon first boot, but is retained if upgrading from the original release of Windows 98 to Windows 98 Second Edition.

Windows 98 Second Edition did not ship with the WinG API or RealPlayer 4.0, unlike the original release of Windows 98, due to both of these having been superseded by DirectX and Windows Media Player, respectively.

==Upgradeability==
Several components of Windows 98 can be updated to newer versions. These include:
* Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and Outlook Express 6 SP1
* Windows Media Format Runtime and Windows Media Player 9 Series
* Windows Media Encoder 7.1 and Windows Media 8 Encoding Utility
* DirectX 9.0c (the latest compatible runtime is from October 2007.)
* MSN Messenger 7.0
* Significant features from newer Microsoft operating systems can be installed on Windows 98. Chief among them are .NET Framework version 2.0, the Visual C++ 2005 runtime, Windows Installer 2.0, the GDI+ redistributable library, Remote Desktop Connection client 5.2 and the Text Services Framework.
* Several other components such as MSXML 3.0 SP7, Microsoft Agent 2.0, NetMeeting 3.01, MSAA 2.0, ActiveSync 3.8, WSH 5.6, Microsoft Data Access Components 2.81 SP1, WMI 1.5 and Speech API 4.0.
* Office XP SP3
* Although Windows 98 does not fully support Unicode, certain Unicode applications can run if the Microsoft Layer for Unicode is installed.

==System requirements==
The majority of copies of Windows 98 were distributed in CD-ROM. A -inch floppy disk version was available for older machines, albeit only via mail order. The floppy disk version of Windows 98 came on 39 DMF formatted floppy disks and excluded some additional software components that the CD-ROM version might have featured. The original release of Windows 98 was the last version of Windows to be available on floppy disks, as Windows 98 Second Edition was only available on CD-ROMs. Microsoft Plus! for Windows 98 was also only available on CD-ROMs.

The two major versions of Windows 98 have minimum requirements needed to be run.

Users can bypass processor requirement checks with the undocumented /NM setup switch. This allows installation on computers with processors as old as the Intel 80386.

=== Limitations ===
The original release of Windows 98 may fail to boot on computers with a processor faster than 2.1 GHz. The Active Channels Channel bar will also not set up properly on computers with a processor faster than 1.5 GHz.

Windows 98 is only designed to handle up to 512 MB of RAM without changes; the maximum amount of RAM the operating system is designed to use is up to 1 GB of RAM. Systems with more than 1.5 GB of RAM may continuously reboot during startup.

Windows 98 may have problems running on hard drives of capacities larger than 32 GB in systems with certain Phoenix BIOS configurations. A software update fixed this shortcoming.

==Support lifecycle==
Computers running Windows 98 can be directly upgraded to Windows XP, providing they meet the requirements for Windows XP. Support for Windows 98 under Microsoft&#x27;s consumer product life cycle policy was originally planned to end on June 30, 2003, however, in December 2002, Microsoft extended the support window to January 16, 2004. This date would then be extended again to June 30, 2006 on January 13, 2004 up to a final end of support date of July 11, 2006, citing support volumes in emerging markets as the reason for the extension.

Retail availability for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002, and later became completely unavailable from Microsoft in any form (through MSDN or otherwise) due to the terms of Java-related settlements Microsoft made with Sun Microsystems.

In 2011, Microsoft retired the Windows Update v4 website. An independent project named Windows Update Restored aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows 98.

==Reception==
Windows 98 was released to positive reviews, with praise directed to its improved graphical user interface and customizability, ease of use, and the degree to which it addressed complaints that users and critics had with Windows 95. Michael Sweet of &quot;Smart Computing&quot; characterized it as heavily integrating features of the web browser, and found file and folder navigation easier. Ed Bott of &quot;PC Computing&quot; lauded the bug fixes, easier troubleshooting, and support for hardware advances such as DVD players and USB. However, he also found that the operating system crashed only slightly less frequently, and criticized the high upgrade price and system requirements. He rated it four stars out of five.

===Sales===
Windows 98 sold 530,000 licenses in its first four days of availability, overtaking Windows 95&#x27;s 510,000. It later sold a total of 580,000 and 350,000 licenses in the first and second months of availability, respectively.

In the first year of its release, Windows 98 sold a total of 15 million licenses – 2 million more than its predecessor. However, International Data Corporation estimated that of the roughly 89 million shipped computers in the desktop market, the operating system had a market share of 17.2 percent, compared to Windows 95&#x27;s 57.4 percent. Meanwhile, the two operating systems continued to observe a trend whereby Windows 98 improved in sales performance, whereas Windows 95 dwindled. After a legal dispute and subsequent settlement with Sun Microsystems over the former&#x27;s Java Virtual Machine, Microsoft ceased distributing the operating system on December 15, 2003, and IDC estimated that a total of 58 million copies were installed worldwide by then.

<text>Mauretania (; ) is the Latin name for a region in the ancient Maghreb. It extended from central present-day Algeria to the Atlantic, encompassing northern present-day Morocco, and from the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlas Mountains. Its native inhabitants, of Berber ancestry, were known to the Romans as the Mauri and the Masaesyli.

In 25 BC, the kings of Mauretania became Roman vassals until about 44 AD, when the area was annexed to Rome and divided into two provinces: Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis. Christianity spread there from the 3rd century onwards. After the Muslim Arabs subdued the region in the 7th century, Islam became the dominant religion.

== Moorish kingdom ==

Mauretania existed as a tribal kingdom of the Berber Mauri people. In the early 1st century Strabo recorded &quot;Maûroi&quot; (Μαῦροι in Greek) as the native name of a people opposite the Iberian Peninsula. This appellation was adopted into Latin, whereas the Greek name for the tribe was &quot;Mauroúsii&quot; (Μαυρούσιοι). The Mediterranean coast of Mauretania had commercial harbours for trade with Carthage from before the 4th century BC, but the interior was controlled by Berber tribes, who had established themselves in the region by the Iron Age.

King Atlas was a legendary king of Mauretania credited with inventing the celestial globe. The first known historical king of the Mauri, Baga, ruled during the Second Punic War of 218–201 BC. The Mauri were in close contact with Numidia. Bocchus I ([fl.] 110 BC) was father-in-law to the redoubted Numidian king Jugurtha.

After the death of king Bocchus II in 33 BC Rome directly administered the region from 33 BC to 25 BC. Mauretania eventually became a client kingdom of the Roman Empire in 25 BC when the Romans installed Juba II of Numidia as their client-king. On his death in AD 23, his Roman-educated son Ptolemy of Mauretania succeeded him. The Emperor Caligula had Ptolemy executed in AD 40. The Roman Emperor Claudius annexed Mauretania directly as a Roman province in AD 44, placing it under an imperial governor (either a &quot;procurator Augusti&quot;, or a &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;).

===Kings===


== Roman province(s) ==
In the 1st century AD, Emperor Claudius divided the Roman province of Mauretania into Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana along the line of the Mulucha (Muluya) River, about 60 km west of modern Oran:
*Mauretania Tingitana was named after its capital Tingis (now Tangier); it corresponded to northern Morocco (including the current Spanish enclaves).
*Mauretania Caesariensis was named after its capital Caesarea (now Cherchell); and comprised western and central Algeria.
Mauretania gave the empire one emperor, the equestrian Macrinus. He seized power after the assassination of Caracalla in 217 but was himself defeated and executed by Elagabalus the next year.

Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s Tetrarchy reform (293) further divided the area into three provinces, as the small, easternmost region of Sitifensis was split off from Mauretania Caesariensis.

The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (c. 400) mentions them as still existing, two being under the authority of the Vicarius of the diocese of Africa: 
*A &quot;Dux et praeses provinciae Mauritaniae et Caesariensis&quot;, i.e. a Roman governor of the rank of &quot;Vir spectabilis&quot;, who also held the high military command of &quot;dux&quot;, as the superior of eight border garrison commanders, each styled &quot;Praepositus limitis ...&quot;, followed by (genitive forms) &quot;Columnatensis&quot;, &quot;Vidensis&quot;, &quot;inferioris&quot; (i.e. lower border), &quot;Fortensis&quot;, &quot;Muticitani&quot;, &quot;Audiensis&quot;, &quot;Caputcellensis&quot; and &quot;Augustensis&quot;.
*A (civilian) &quot;Praeses&quot; in the province of Mauretania Sitifensis.

And, under the authority of the&quot; Vicarius&quot; of the diocese of Hispaniae: 
== Late Antiquity ==
=== Mauro-Roman Kingdom ===
During the crisis of the 3rd century, parts of Mauretania were reconquered by Berber tribes. Direct Roman rule became confined to a few coastal cities (such as Septem in Mauretania Tingitana and Cherchell in Mauretania Caesariensis) by the late 3rd century.

Historical sources about inland areas are sparse, but these were apparently controlled by local Berber rulers who, however, maintained a degree of Roman culture, including the local cities, and usually nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Roman Emperors.
In an inscription from Altava in western Algeria, one of these rulers, Masuna, described himself as &quot;rex gentium Maurorum et Romanorum&quot; (king of the Roman and Moorish peoples). Altava was later the capital of another ruler, Garmul or Garmules, who resisted Byzantine rule in Africa but was finally defeated in 578.

The Byzantine historian Procopius also mentions another independent ruler, Mastigas, who controlled most of Mauretania Caesariensis in the 530s. In the 7th century there were eight Romano-Moorish kingdoms: Altava, Ouarsenis, Hodna, Aures, Nemenchas, Capsa, Dorsale and Cabaon.

The last resistance against the Arab invasion was sustained in the second half of the 7th century mainly by the Roman-Moorish kingdoms -with the last Byzantine troops in the region- under the leadership of the Christian king of Altava Caecilius, but later ended in complete defeat in 703 AD (when the queen Kahina died in battle).

===Vandal kingdom===
The Vandals conquered the Roman province beginning in the 420s. 

The city of Hippo Regius fell to the Vandals in 431 after a prolonged siege, and Carthage also fell in 439. Theodosius II dispatched an expedition to deal with the Vandals in 441, which failed to progress farther than Sicily. The Western Empire under Valentinian III secured peace with the Vandals in 442, confirming their control of Proconsular Africa. For the next 90 years, Africa was firmly under the Vandal control. The Vandals were ousted from Africa in the Vandalic War of 533–534, from which time Mauretania at least nominally became a Roman province once again.

The old provinces of the Roman Diocese of Africa were mostly preserved by the Vandals, but large parts, including almost all of Mauretania Tingitana, much of Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Sitifensis and large parts of the interior of Numidia and Byzacena, had been lost to the inroads of Berber tribes, now collectively called the &quot;Mauri&quot; (later Moors) as a generic term for &quot;the Berber tribes in the province of Mauretania&quot;.

===Praetorian prefecture of Africa===

In 533, the Roman army under Belisarius defeated the Vandals. In April 534, Justinian published a law concerning the administrative organization of the newly acquired territories. Nevertheless, Justinian restored the old administrative division, but raised the overall governor at Carthage to the supreme administrative rank of praetorian prefect, thereby ending the Diocese of Africa&#x27;s traditional subordination to the Prefecture of Italy (then still under Ostrogoth rule).

=== Exarchate of Africa===

The emperor Maurice sometime between 585 and 590 AD created the office of &quot;Exarch&quot;, which combined the supreme civil authority of a praetorian prefect and the military authority of a &quot;magister militum&quot;, and enjoyed considerable autonomy from Constantinople. Two exarchates were established, one in Italy, with seat at Ravenna (hence known as the Exarchate of Ravenna), and one in Africa, based at Carthage and including all imperial possessions in the Western Mediterranean. The first African exarch was the &quot;patricius&quot; Gennadius.

Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Sitifensis were merged to form the new province of Mauretania Prima, while Mauretania Tingitana, effectively reduced to the city of Septem, was combined with the citadels of the Spanish coast (Spania) and the Balearic Islands to form Mauretania Secunda. The African exarch was in possession of &quot;Mauretania Secunda&quot;, which was little more than a tiny outpost in southern Spain, beleaguered by the Visigoths. 

The last Spanish strongholds were conquered by the Visigoths in 624 AD, reducing &quot;Mauretania Seconda&quot; opposite Gibraltar to only the fort of Septem.

== Religion ==
Christianity is known to have existed in Mauretania as early as the 3rd century. It spread rapidly in these areas despite its relatively late appearance in the region. Although it was adopted in the urban areas of Mauretania Caesariensis, the hinterlands retained the Romano-Berber religion.

<text>Leonardo Ortolani (born 14 January 1967), better known as Leo, is an Italian comics author, creator of the comic book series &quot;Rat-Man&quot;.

== Early life ==
He was born in Pisa. In 1968 Ortolani moved to Parma, where he still lives with his wife Caterina and his adoptive daughters Johanna and Lucy Maria.

From an early age, Ortolani showed a great passion for the world of comic books, and in particular&quot; The Fantastic Four&quot; by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, which will affect its style of narrative.

After finishing high school, he enrolled at the University of Parma to study Geology. While at university, Ortolani draws his characters first, and the theme of geology became a catchphrase of the first issues of his major work,&quot; Rat-Man&quot;.

== Career ==
=== First works and the creation of Rat-Man ===
In 1989 joined publishing house&quot; Comic Art&quot; to work on two stories: the tragic and the other comic. Publisher Rinaldo Traini published the comic story on the second&quot; Spot&quot; (supplement of&quot; Eternauta&quot; dedicated to beginners), marking the Birth of Rat-Man.

&quot; The shocking origins of Rat-Man&quot; earned Ortolani an award for best newcomer by Lucca Comics of 1990. With this visibility, Leo began to collaborate with magazines and independent fanzines.

For the fanzine&quot;Made in USA&quot; he created two more stories starring Rat-Man (&quot; Topin! The Wonder Mouse!&quot; And&quot; From the Future&quot;) and several parodies of superheroes (including X-Men, Fantastic Four and Superman).

The most important works of this cycle are his four parodies of the Fantastic Four. Kirby stopped drawing&quot; Fantastic Four&quot; at issue #102. Ortolani wrote numbers 103-106, completely upsetting the group.
Called to military service in the Air Force, Ortolani drew inspiration from life in the barracks, gathering his experiences in a detailed diary that became the starting point for&quot; The last rookie&quot;, a strip on military life (the same as the protagonist Ortolani) which were published as an appendix to&quot; Storm Trooper&quot;.

During this period, Ortolani also collaborated on the &quot;Starcomìx&quot; humor magazine directed by Luca Boschi and published by Star Comics in &quot;Totem Comic&quot; and &quot;Totem Extra&quot;, where he made&quot; The impervious&quot;, &quot;Clan&quot;, &quot;The wonder of nature&quot; and &quot;The wonders of technology&quot;. In this period he also stripped the series &quot;Those of Parma&quot;, published in the &quot;Gazzetta di Parma&quot;, speaking of the city of Parma and its inhabitants, a selection of which was collected in the volume &quot;Editions Bands Dessinée&quot;. The short stories of the series of &quot;Wonderland&quot; were taken years later, collected in three volumes by Panini Comics.

=== Popularity and the contract with Marvel Italia ===
In 1995 Leo Ortolani published &quot;Venerdì 12&quot; as a series of the comic magazine L&#x27;isola che non c&#x27;è. That same year, Ortolani chose to self-publish the comic book series &quot;Rat-Man&quot; alongside his primary job as a geologist; however, in 1997 Leo signed a contract with Marvel Italia, today a brand owned by Panini Comics (and, at the time, a branch of Marvel Comics itself), to publish the comic under the Marvel brand, which allowed Leonardo to become a full-time comics author. The contract also allowed him to use popular Marvel characters like Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Doctor Doom and Elektra in Rat-Man stories; however, copyright problems have since prohibited such use of characters in the Rat-Man world.

=== Successful parodies ===
Ortolani created several popular parodies of famous works of fiction and blockbusters in his Rat-Man stories. In 1999 Leo Ortolani created &quot;Star Rats&quot;, a parody of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In 2004 he created &quot;Il Signore dei Ratti&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. In 2005 Ortolani published &quot;Star Rats - Episodio I&quot;, a parody of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, which was the best selling Panini Comics book in the release month. In 2007 Ortolani created &quot;299+1&quot;, a parody of &quot;300&quot; and one of his best works. In 2009 he created &quot;Ratto&quot;, a parody of &quot;Rambo&quot; films. In 2010 he published &quot;Avarat&quot;, a parody of &quot;Avatar&quot;. In 2011 Leo Ortolani created &quot;La Quadrilogia dei Sacrificabili&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Expendables&quot; series, that won the award &quot;Fede a strisce 2011&quot; at RiminiComix. In 2012 he created &quot;Il Grande Magazzi&quot;, a parody of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Twilight&quot; series. That same year he published also &quot;Allen&quot;, a parody of &quot;Alien&quot;. In 2014 Leo Ortolani published &quot;Star Rats - Episodio II&quot;, a parody of &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;, and then soon after in 2015 he published also &quot;Star Rats - Episodio III&quot;, a parody of &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot;.

=== The end of the series &quot;Rat-Man&quot; ===
In 2016 Ortolani stated his intention to close the series &quot;Rat-Man&quot; with issue #122, which was published around September 2017.

<text>&quot;Rat Man&quot; was the nickname given by Sigmund Freud to a patient whose &quot;case history&quot; was published as &quot;Bemerkungen über einen Fall von Zwangsneurose&quot; [&quot;Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis&quot;] (1909). This was the second of six case histories that Freud published and the first in which he claimed that the patient had been cured by psychoanalysis.

The nickname derives from the fact that among the patient&#x27;s many compulsions was an obsession with nightmarish fantasies about rats.

To protect the anonymity of patients, psychoanalytic case studies usually withheld or disguised the names of the individuals concerned (Anna O., Little Hans, Wolf Man, Dora, etc.). Recent researchers have determined that the &quot;Rat Man&quot; was in fact a lawyer named Ernst Lanzer (1878–1914)—though many other sources maintain that the man&#x27;s name was Paul Lorenz.

== History of the analysis ==
Lanzer first came to Freud in October 1907 complaining of obsessive fears and compulsive impulses. Freud treated his patient for a little over three months on a regular daily basis. The treatment was irregular for the next three months and sporadic, at best, after that.

Lanzer&#x27;s principal fear was that something terrible was going to happen to his father and a female friend (who later became his wife). His fear had grown out of an account he heard from a fellow army officer concerning a Chinese torture method in which a large pot containing a live rat was strapped to the buttocks of the victim, and the rat, encouraged by a red-hot poker, would gnaw its way out through the victim&#x27;s anus.

Lanzer claimed that he fantasized about murder and suicide, and he developed a number of compulsive irrational behavior patterns. For example, he mentioned his habit of opening the door to his flat between 12 midnight and 1:00 A.M., apparently so that his father&#x27;s ghost could enter. Lanzer would then stare at his penis, sometimes using a mirror.

Freud encouraged Lanzer to discuss details of his sex life (such as his first efforts at masturbation at age 20) and focused on a number of verbal associations with the word &quot;Ratten&quot; (&quot;rats&quot;). 

Lanzer introduced Freud to Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s phrase (which Freud later cited) &quot;&#x27;I did this,&#x27; says my Memory. &#x27;I cannot have done this,&#x27; says my Pride, and remains inexorable. In the end – Memory yields.&quot; Freud retold the saying more than once, and it was used by later therapists such as Fritz Perls.

Lanzer broke off his analysis with Freud after a relatively brief period and well before his transference had been fully resolved. Just after Freud had completed the written version of the case history in October 1909, he confessed to Carl Jung that his patient was having ongoing problems. Lanzer was killed in World War I, and later researchers were unable to interview him.

== Freud&#x27;s write-up: &quot;Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis&quot; ==
Freud was led to publish the Rat Man case history because he was feeling pressured to show the world that psychoanalysis could achieve successful therapeutic results. Because the Rat Man previously consulted Julius von Wagner-Jauregg, Freud&#x27;s eminent psychiatric colleague at the University of Vienna, the case was a particularly critical test of Freud&#x27;s therapeutic abilities. Before October 1908, when he communicated this case history at the first International Psychoanalytic Congress in Salzburg, Austria, Freud had yet to publish the results of a successful psychoanalysis.

The case study was published in 1909 in Germany. Freud saw the Rat Man patient for some six months despite later claiming the treatment lasted about a year. He considered the treatment a success.

The patient presented with obsessional thoughts and with behaviors that he felt compelled to carry out, which had been precipitated by the loss/replacement of his pince-nez and the problem of paying for them, combined with the impact of a story he heard from a fellow officer about a torture wherein rats would eat their way into the anal cavity of the victim. The patient then felt a compulsion to imagine that this fate was befalling two people dear to him, specifically his father and his fiancée. The irrational nature of this obsession is revealed by the fact that the man had the greatest regard for his fiancée and that his revered father had been dead for some years. Freud theorized that these obsessive ideas and similar thoughts were produced by conflicts consisting of the combination of loving and aggressive impulses relating to the people concerned – what Eugen Bleuler later called ambivalence.

The Rat Man often defended himself against his own thoughts. He had had a secret thought that he wished his father would die so he could inherit all of his money and become rich enough to marry, before shaming himself by fantasizing that his father would die and leave him nothing. The patient even goes so far as to fantasize about marrying Freud&#x27;s daughter, believing (Freud writes) that &quot;the only reason I was so kind and incredibly patient with him was that I wanted to have him for a son-in-law&quot; – a matter linked in the transference to his conflicts between his mother&#x27;s wish for him to marry rich like his father and his fiancée&#x27;s poverty.

In addition, the symptoms were believed to keep the patient from needing to make difficult decisions in his current life, and to ward off the anxiety that would be involved in experiencing the angry and aggressive impulses directly. The patient&#x27;s older sister and father had died, and these losses were considered, along with his suicidal thoughts and his tendency, to form part of the tissue of phantasies, verbal associations and symbolic meanings in which he was trapped. Freud believed that they had their origin in the Rat Man&#x27;s sexual experiences of infancy, in particular harsh punishment for childhood masturbation, and the vicissitudes of sexual curiosity.

In the theoretical second part of the case study, Freud elaborates on such defence mechanisms as &quot;rationalization&quot;, &quot;doubt&quot;, undoing and &quot;displacement&quot;.

In a later footnote, Freud laments that although &quot;the patient&#x27;s mental health was restored to him by the analysis ... like so many young men of value and promise, he perished in the Great War&quot;.

A number of significant discrepancies between the published case history and Freud&#x27;s process notes, which were discovered among his papers after his death, have been pointed out by Patrick Mahony. According to Mahony, who is an analyst and sympathetic to the general goals of psychoanalysis, Freud&#x27;s published case history is &quot;muddled&quot; and &quot;inconsistent&quot; on various matters of fact and also exhibits &quot;glaring&quot; omissions of information. In particular, there is an overemphasis on the father to the exclusion of the mother. Mahony states &quot;Freud mixed momentous insights with exaggerated claims,&quot; some of which &quot;were made in his zeal to protect and promote a new discipline.&quot;

==Legacy==
Jacques Lacan built his early structuralist theory around the Rat Man case, in particular the polarity of father–rich wife/son–poor wife as an intergenerational force creating the individual neurosis.

Freud&#x27;s late note upon the Rat Man&#x27;s acute sense of smell would later be developed into his theory of the process of civilisation and organic repression.

==Criticism of Freud==
Peter Gay concluded in &quot;&quot; (1988) that &quot;apart from a handful of interesting deviations, the case history Freud published generally followed the process notes he made every night&quot;. Patrick Mahony, a psychoanalyst and professor of English at the University of Montreal, has highlighted such discrepancies in his detailed study &quot;Freud and the Rat Man,&quot; published in 1986 by the Yale University Press.

Dr. Mahony said Freud seems to have consistently implied that the case lasted longer than it actually did. He also said Freud claimed in a lecture to be able to guess the name of the Rat Man&#x27;s girlfriend, Gisela, from an anagram, &quot;Glejisamen&quot;, which the patient had invented. Actually, the notes show Freud had learned her name first, and then used it to deduce the meaning of the anagram, although in the actual case study Freud merely states that &quot;when he told it to me, I could not help noticing that the word was in fact an anagram of the name of his lady&quot;.

Critics have objected to Freud&#x27;s downplaying of the role of the Rat Man&#x27;s mother, and for several deviations on his part from what later became standard psychoanalytic practice.

===Efficacy of the treatment===
Mahoney accepted that Freud obtained a degree of success in restoring his patient to functional life, though he considered Freud exaggerated the extent of this in his case study. Others have suggested that by concentrating on building rapport with his patient, at the expense of analyzing the negative transference, Freud merely achieved a temporary transference cure. Lacan for his part concluded that although he did not &quot;regard the Rat Man as a case that Freud cured&quot;, in it &quot;Freud made the fundamental discoveries, which we are still living off, concerning the dynamics and structure of obsessional neurosis&quot;.

In a letter Freud wrote to Jung, shortly after publication of the case study, he claimed of the Rat Man that &quot;he is facing life with courage and ability. The one point that still gives him trouble (father-complex and transference) has shown up clearly in my conversations with this intelligent and grateful man&quot; – a not insignificant reservation. But while Freud in the case-history had certainly claimed that &quot;the patient&#x27;s rat delirium had disappeared&quot;, he had also pointed out the limited time and depth of the analysis: &quot;The patient recovered, and his ordinary life began to assert its claims...which were incompatible with a continuation of the treatment&quot;.

As the average length of time expected of an analysis increased from months to years over the 20th century, so too the success of the Rat Man&#x27;s case has perhaps come to resemble rather the symptomatic relief of brief psychotherapy or focal psychotherapy, more than the achievement of a full psychoanalysis.

<text>Venerdì 12 (&quot;Friday the 12th,&quot; a spoof of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;) is a comic strip series created by Italian author Leo Ortolani first published in 1996 as a series in the comic magazine &quot;L&#x27;isola che non c&#x27;è&quot; and continued on the &quot;Rat-Man Collection&quot;, where it was also completed.
It tells the story of Aldo, a man who becomes a hideous monster after being dumped by his girlfriend Bedelia and his evil servant .

==Plot==
Everything starts at school, where Aldo meets and falls in love with Bedelia, a schoolmate of his who has had an affair with almost every boy at school but him. He tries many approaches, failing miserably, until Bedelia accepts his court in order to win a bet. So Aldo, full of joy, decides to buy her, as a birthday gift, a music box. The salesman offers him, for free, a cursed music box with a dancing puppet warning him: if he gives it to a woman who does not love him, he will turn into a monster; the curse will be broken only if he finds a woman who really loves him or if he sacrifices a virgin. Aldo ignores the curse and, on the titular Friday, October 12, gives the music box to Bedelia, who, shortly after, breaks up with him and throws the music box out of the window of her car, breaking the statuette on it. Aldo, left alone in the middle of the street, painfully turns into a monster. It&#x27;s here that he meets Giuda, an extravagant runt who is searching for a master and accepts to become Aldo&#x27;s evil servant.

From that moment, Aldo first tries to take back Bedelia; then, helped but more often hindered by Giuda, tries to find, despite his appearance only partially hidden by a mask, someone who really loves him to break the curse, as it is easier than finding a virgin. In his misadventures he will meet various strange women like Ciurga and Isolda and finally meets Dlcistella, his neighbour, who finally breaks the curse, on Saturday the 13th, making Aldo to l in love with her. Moreover, in that moment it&#x27;s also revealed that Giuda is in reality the music box&#x27;s statuette, so he turns back into the music box, ready to serve the next unrequited lover who will be cursed.</text><links>

<doc id="75450" wikidata="Q669408" url="?curid=75450" title="Metamerism (color)">
<text>In colorimetry, metamerism is a perceived matching of colors with different (nonmatching) spectral power distributions. Colors that match this way are called metamers.

A spectral power distribution describes the proportion of total light given off (emitted, transmitted, or reflected) by a color sample at each visible wavelength; it defines the complete information about the light coming from the sample. However, the human eye contains only three color receptors (three types of cone cells), which means that all colors are reduced to three sensory quantities, called the tristimulus values. Metamerism occurs because each type of cone responds to the cumulative energy from a broad range of wavelengths, so that different combinations of light across all wavelengths can produce an equivalent receptor response and the same tristimulus values or color sensation. In color science, the set of sensory spectral sensitivity curves is numerically represented by color matching functions.

== Sources of metamerism ==
Metameric matches are quite common, especially in near neutral (grayed or whitish colors) or dark colors. As colors become brighter or more saturated, the range of possible metameric matches (different combinations of light wavelengths) becomes smaller, especially in colors from surface reflectance spectra.

Metameric matches made between two light sources provide the trichromatic basis of colorimetry. The basis for nearly all commercially available color image reproduction processes such as photography, television, printing, and digital imaging, is the ability to make metameric color matches.

Making metameric matches using reflective materials is more complex. The appearance of surface colors is defined by the product of the spectral reflectance curve of the material and the spectral emittance curve of the light source shining on it. As a result, the color of surfaces depends on the light source used to illuminate them.

== Metameric failure ==
The term illuminant metameric failure or illuminant metamerism is sometimes used to describe situations in which two material samples match when viewed under one light source but not another. Most types of fluorescent lights produce an irregular or peaky spectral emittance curve, so that two materials under fluorescent light might not match, even though they are a metameric match to an incandescent &quot;white&quot; light source with a nearly flat or smooth emittance curve. Material colors that match under one source will often appear different under the other. Inkjet printing is particularly susceptible, and inkjet proofs are best viewed under a 5000K color temperature lighting source, with good color rendering properties, for color accuracy.

Normally, material attributes such as translucency, gloss or surface texture are not considered in color matching. However geometric metameric failure or geometric metamerism can occur when two samples match when viewed from one angle, but then fail to match when viewed from a different angle. A common example is the color variation that appears in pearlescent automobile finishes or &quot;metallic&quot; paper; e.g., Kodak Endura Metallic, Fujicolor Crystal Archive Digital Pearl.

Observer metameric failure or observer metamerism can occur because of differences in color vision between observers. The common source of observer metameric failure is colorblindness, but it can also occur among &quot;normal&quot; observers. In all cases, the proportion of long-wavelength-sensitive cones to medium-wavelength-sensitive cones in the retina, the profile of light sensitivity in each type of cone, and the amount of yellowing in the lens and macular pigment of the eye, differs from one person to the next. This alters the relative importance of different wavelengths in a spectral power distribution to each observer&#x27;s color perception. As a result, two spectrally dissimilar lights or surfaces may produce a color match for one observer but fail to match when viewed by a second observer.

Field-size metameric failure or field-size metamerism occurs because the relative proportions of the three cone types in the retina vary from the center of the visual field to the periphery, so that colors that match when viewed as very small, centrally fixated areas may appear different when presented as large color areas. In many industrial applications, large-field color matches are used to define color tolerances.

Finally, device metamerism comes up due to the lack of consistency of colorimeters of the same or different manufacturers. Colorimeters basically consist of a combination of a matrix of sensor cells and optical filters, which present an unavoidable variance in their measurements. Moreover, devices built by different manufacturers can differ in their construction.

The difference in the spectral compositions of two metameric stimuli is often referred to as the degree of metamerism. The sensitivity of a metameric match to any changes in the spectral elements that form the colors depend on the degree of metamerism. Two stimuli with a high degree of metamerism are likely to be very sensitive to any changes in the illuminant, material composition, observer, field of view, and so on.

The word &quot;metamerism&quot; is often used to indicate a metameric failure rather than a match, or used to describe a situation in which a metameric match is easily degraded by a slight change in conditions, such as a change in the illuminant.

== Measuring metamerism ==

The best-known measure of metamerism is the color rendering index (CRI), which is a linear function of the mean Euclidean distance between the test and reference spectral reflectance vectors in the CIE 1964 color space. CRI has been replaced with an updated metric, IES:TM30, that provides a more accurate assessment of fidelity and adds features for assessing how a test light will change the saturation and hue of colorants as compared to the reference light. Another metric, for daylight simulators, is the MI, the CIE metamerism index, which is derived by calculating the mean color difference of eight metamers (five in the visible spectrum and three in the ultraviolet range) in CIELAB or CIELUV. The salient difference between CRI and MI is the color space used to calculate the color difference, the one used in CRI being obsolete and not perceptually uniform.

MI can be decomposed into MIvis and MIUV if only part of the spectrum is being considered. The numerical result can be interpreted by rounding into one of five letter categories:

== Metamerism and industry ==
Using materials that are metameric color matches rather than spectral color matches is a significant problem in industries where color matching or color tolerances are important.

A classic example is the automobile industry: the colorants used for interior fabrics, plastics and paints may be chosen to provide a good color match under a cool white fluorescent source, but the matches can disappear under different light sources (e.g. daylight or tungsten source). Furthermore, because of the differences in colorants, spectral matches are infrequent and metamerism often occurs.

=== Textile industry ===
Color matching in the textile dyeing industry is essential. In this branch, three types of metamerism are commonly encountered: illuminant metamerism, observer metamerism and field-size metamerism. Due to the wide range of different illuminants in modern life, textile color matching is difficult to ensure. Metamerism on large textile items can be resolved by using different light sources when comparing colors. However, metamerism in smaller items such as textile fibers, is more difficult to be solved. This difficulty arises due to the necessity of a microscope, which has one single illumination source, to observe these small fibers. Therefore, metameric fibres cannot be distinguished neither macroscopically nor microscopically. A method which can solve metamerism in fibres combines microscopy and spectroscopy, and is called microspectroscopy.

=== Paint industry ===
Color matches made in the paint industry are often aimed at achieving a &quot;spectral color match&quot; rather than just a tristimulus (metameric) color match under a given spectrum of light. A spectral color match attempts to give two colors the same spectral reflectance characteristic, making them a good metameric match with a low degree of metamerism, and thereby reducing the sensitivity of the resulting color match to changes in illuminant, or differences between observers. One way to circumvent metamerism in paints is by using exactly the same pigment and base color compositions in the reproductions as the ones which were used in the original. When the composition of pigment and base color is unknown, metamerism can be avoided only with the use of colorimetric devices.

=== Printing industry ===
The printing industry is also affected by metamerism. Inkjet printers do the mixing of colors under a specific light source, resulting in a modified appearance of original and copy under different light sources. One way to minimize metamerism in printing is by first measuring the spectral reflectance of an object or reproduction using a color measurement device. Then, one selects a set of ink compositions corresponding to the color reflectance factor, which are used by the inkjet printer for the reproduction. The process is repeated until original and reproduction present an acceptable degree of metamerism. Sometimes, however, one reaches the conclusion that an improved match is not possible with the materials available either due to gamut limitations or colorimetric properties.

<text>Cyrenaica ( ) or Kyrenaika (, , after the city of Cyrene), is the eastern region of Libya. Cyrenaica includes all of the eastern part of Libya between the 16th and 25th meridians east, including the Kufra District. The coastal region, also known as &quot;Pentapolis&quot; (&quot;Five Cities&quot;) in antiquity, was part of the Roman province of Crete and Cyrenaica, later divided into &quot;Libya Pentapolis&quot; and &quot;Libya Sicca&quot;. During the Islamic period, the area came to be known as &quot;Barqa&quot;, after the city of Barca.

Cyrenaica became an Italian colony in 1911. After the 1934 formation of Italian Libya, the Cyrenaica province was designated as one of the three primary provinces of the country. During World War II, it fell under British military and civil administration from 1943 until 1951, and finally in the Kingdom of Libya from 1951 until 1963. The region that used to be Cyrenaica officially until 1963 has formed several shabiyat, the administrative divisions of Libya, since 1995. The 2011 Libyan Civil War started in Cyrenaica, which came largely under the control of the National Transitional Council (headquartered in Benghazi) for most of the war. In 2012, a body known as the Cyrenaica Transitional Council unilaterally declared Cyrenaica to be an autonomous region of Libya.

==Geography==

Geologically, Cyrenaica rests on a mass of Miocene limestone that tilts up steeply from the Mediterranean Sea and falls inland with a gradual descent to sea level again.

This mass is divided into two blocks. The Jebel Akhdar extends parallel to the coast from the Gulf of Sidra to the Gulf of Bomba and reaches an elevation of 882 meters. There is no continuous coastal plain, the longest strip running from the recess of Gulf of Sidra past Benghazi to Tolmeita. Thereafter, except for deltaic patches at Susa and Derna, the shore is all precipitous. A steep escarpment separates the coastal plain from a relatively level plateau, known as the Marj Plain, which lies at about 300 meters elevation. Above the Marj Plain lies a dissected plateau at about 700 meters elevation, which contains the highest peaks in the range.

The Jebel Akhdar and its adjacent coast are part of the Mediterranean woodlands and forests ecoregion and have a Mediterranean climate of hot, dry summers and relatively mild and rainy winters. The plant communities of this portion of Cyrenaica include forest, woodland, maquis, garrigue, steppe and oak savanna. Garrigue shrublands occupy the non-agricultural portions coastal plain and coastal escarpments, with &quot;Sarcopoterium spinosum&quot;, along with &quot;Asphodelus ramosus&quot; and &quot;Artemisia herba-alba&quot;, as the predominant species. Small areas of maquis are found on north-facing slopes near the sea, becoming more extensive on the lower plateau. &quot;Juniperus phoenicea, Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus coccifera&quot; and &quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot; are common tree and large shrub species in the maquis. The upper plateau includes areas of garrigue, two maquis communities, one dominated by &quot;Pistacia lentiscus&quot; and the other a mixed maquis in which the endemic &quot;Arbutus pavarii&quot; is prominent, and forests of &quot;Cupressus sempervirens, Juniperus phoenicea, Olea europaea, Quercus coccifera, Ceratonia siliqua,&quot; and &quot;Pinus halepensis.&quot;

Areas of red soil are found on the Marj Plain, which has borne abundant crops of wheat and barley from ancient times to the present day. Plenty of springs issue on the highlands. Wild olive trees are abundant, and large areas of oak savanna provide pasture to the flocks and herds of the local Bedouins. Historically large areas of range were covered in forest. The forested area of the Jebel Akhdar has been shrinking in recent decades. A 1996 report to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimated that the forested area was reduced to 320,000 hectares from 500,000 hectares, mostly cleared to grow crops. The Green Mountain Conservation and Development Authority estimates that the forested area decreased from 500,000 hectares in 1976 to 180,000 hectares in 2007.

The southward slopes of the Jebel Akhdar are occupied by the Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe, a transitional ecoregion lying between the Mediterranean climate regions of North Africa and the hyper-arid Sahara.

The lower Jebel el-Akabah lies to the south and east of the Jebel Akhdar. The two highlands are separated by a depression. This eastern region, known in ancient times as Marmarica, is much drier than the Jebel Akhdar and here the Sahara extends to the coast. Historically, salt-collecting and sponge fishing were more important than agriculture. Bomba and Tobruk have good harbors.

South of the coastal highlands of Cyrenaica is a large east–west running depression, extending eastward from the Gulf of Sidra into Egypt. This region of the Sahara is known as the Libyan Desert, and includes the Great Sand Sea and the Calanshio Sand Sea. The Libyan Desert is home to a few oases, including Awjila and Jaghbub.

== History ==
===Berber people===
The Berbers were the earliest recorded inhabitants of Cyrenaica.

=== Ancient Egyptian Era ===
Egyptian records mention that during the New Kingdom of Egypt (thirteenth century BC), the Libu and Meshwesh tribes of Cyrenaica made frequent incursions into Egypt.

=== Greek colonization ===
Cyrenaica was colonized by the Greeks beginning in the seventh century BC, when it was known as Kyrenaïka. The first and most important colony was that of Cyrene, established in about 631 BC by colonists from the Greek island of Thera, which they had abandoned because of a severe famine. Their commander, Aristoteles, took the Libyan name Battos. His descendants, known as the Battiadae, persisted despite severe conflict with Greeks in neighboring cities.

The eastern portion of the province, with no major population centers, was called Marmarica; the more important western portion was known as the Pentapolis, as it comprised five cities: Cyrene (near the modern village of Shahat) with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), Arsinoe or Taucheira (Tocra), Euesperides or Berenice (near modern Benghazi), Balagrae (Bayda) and Barce (Marj) – of which the chief was the eponymous Cyrene. The term &quot;Pentapolis&quot; continued to be used as a synonym for Cyrenaica. In the south, the Pentapolis faded into the Saharan tribal areas, including the pharaonic oracle of Ammonium.

The region produced barley, wheat, olive oil, wine, figs, apples, wool, sheep, cattle, and silphium, a herb that grew only in Cyrenaica and was regarded as a medicinal cure and aphrodisiac.

Cyrene became one of the greatest intellectual and artistic centers of the Greek world, famous for its medical school, learned academies and architecture, which included some of the finest examples of the Hellenistic style. The Cyrenaics, a school of thinkers who expounded a doctrine of moral cheerfulness that defined happiness as the sum of human pleasures, were founded by Aristippus of Cyrene. Other notable natives of Cyrene were the poet Callimachus and the mathematicians Theodorus and Eratosthenes.

=== Persian rule ===
In 525 BC, after conquering Egypt, the Achaemenid (Persian) army of Cambyses II seized the Pentapolis, and established a satrapy (Achaemenid Persian province) over parts of the region for about the next two centuries.

=== Hellenistic era ===
The Persians were followed by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, who received tribute from the cities after taking Egypt. The Pentapolis was formally annexed by Ptolemy I Soter, and through him passed to the diadoch dynasty of the Lagids, better known as the Ptolemaic dynasty. It briefly gained independence under Magas of Cyrene, stepson of Ptolemy I, but was reabsorbed into the Ptolemaic empire after his death. It was separated from the main kingdom by Ptolemy VIII and given to his son Ptolemy Apion, who, dying without heirs in 96 BC, bequeathed it to the Roman Republic.

=== Roman province ===


The Latin name &quot;Cyrenaica&quot; (or &quot;Kyrenika&quot;) dates to the first century BC. Although some confusion exists as to the exact territory Rome inherited, by 78 BC it was organized as one administrative province together with Crete. It became a senatorial province in 20 BC, like its far more prominent western neighbor Africa proconsularis, and unlike Egypt itself, which became an imperial domain &quot;sui generis&quot; (under a special governor styled &quot;praefectus augustalis&quot;) in 30 BC.

Diocletian&#x27;s Tetrarchy reforms of 293 altered Cyrenaica&#x27;s administrative structure. It was split into two provinces: Libya Superior or Libya Pentapolis, comprising the above-mentioned Pentapolis, with Cyrene as its capital, and Libya Inferior or Libya Sicca, comprising Marmarica, with the important port city of Paraetonium as its capital. Each came under a governor holding the modest rank of &quot;praeses&quot;. Both belonged to the Diocese of the Orient, with its capital at Antioch in Syria, and from 370, to the Diocese of Egypt, within the Praetorian prefecture of Oriens. Its western neighbor Tripolitania, the largest split-off from Africa proconsularis, became part of the Diocese of Africa, subordinate to the prefecture of &quot;Italia et Africa&quot;. Following the Crete earthquake of 365, the capital was moved to Ptolemais. After the Empire&#x27;s division, Cyrenaica became part of the East Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), bordering Tripolitania. It was briefly part of the Vandal Kingdom to the west, until its reconquest by Belisarius in 533.

The Tabula Peutingeriana shows &quot;Pentapolites&quot; to the east of &quot;Syrtes Maiores&quot;, indicating the cities of Bernice, Hadrianopolis, Taucheira, Ptolomaide, Callis, Cenopolis, Balacris and Cyrene.

==== Christianization ====
According to the Synoptic Gospels, Simon of Cyrene carried the cross of Jesus Christ to the crucifixion.

According to one tradition, Mark the Evangelist was born in the Pentapolis, and later returned after preaching with Paul the Apostle in Colosse (Col 4:10) and Rome (Phil 24; 2 Tim 4:11); from Pentapolis he made his way to Alexandria.

Early Christianity spread to Pentapolis from Egypt; Synesius of Cyrene (370–414), bishop of Ptolemais, received his instruction at Alexandria in both the Catechetical School and the Mouseion, and he entertained a great deal of reverence and affection for Hypatia, the last pagan Neoplatonist, whose classes he had attended. Synesius was raised to the episcopate by Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, in 410. Since the First Council of Nicaea in 325, Cyrenaica had been recognized as an ecclesiastical province of the See of Alexandria, per the ruling of the Nicaean Fathers.The patriarch of the Coptic Church to this day includes the Pentapolis in his title as an area within his jurisdiction.

The Eparchy of the Western Pentapolis was part of the Coptic Orthodox Church, as the Pope of Alexandria was the Pope of Africa. The most senior position in The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church after the Pope was the Metropolitan of Western Pentapolis, although, since its demise as a major Archiepiscopal Metropolis in the days of Pope John VI of Alexandria, it was held as a Titular See attached to another Diocese.

After being repeatedly destroyed and restored during the Roman period Pentapolis became a mere borough, but was nevertheless the site of a diocese. Its bishop, Zopyrus, was present at the First Council of Nicaea in 325. The subscriptions at Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451) give the names of two other bishops, Zenobius and Theodorus.

Although it retained the title &quot;Pentapolis&quot;, the ecclesiastic province actually included all of the Cyrenaica, not just the five cities. Pentapolis is still included in the title of Popes of the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.

=== Arab and Ottoman rule ===
Cyrenaica was conquered by Muslim Arabs under command of Amr ibn al-As during the tenure of the second caliph, Omar, in , and became known as Barqah after its provincial capital, the ancient city of Barce. After the breakdown of the Ummayad caliphate it was essentially annexed to Egypt, although still under the same name, first under the Fatimid caliphs. The region became a base for piracy, and many of the pirates acted as privateers for the Fatimids. Around 1051/52, Jabbara, emir of Barqa, transferred his allegiance from the Fatimids to the Zirids.

In the middle of the 11th century, several Arab tribes, including the Bedouin Banu Hilal confederation devastated the North African coast under Zirid control. Barqa was ravaged by the Hilalian invasion and left to be settled by the Banu Sulaym while the Banu Hilal marched westwards. The invasion contributed to the decline of the port cities and maritime trade. Up to 200,000 Hilalian families migrated into Cyrenaica from Egypt. As a result of the migration by Arab tribes, Cyrenaica became more Arab than any place in the Arab world except for the interior of Arabia. The Ayyubid emir Qaraqush marched into the Maghreb and according to al-Maqrizi had taken control of Cyrenaica on orders of Saladin who wanted to use the province as an agricultural base. The Mamluks were seemingly unable to exert any significant control and had to ally with the resident Bedouins to accept their suzerainty indirectly while paying taxes. The Ottoman Empire later claimed suzerainty of Cyrenaica based on the Mamluk claim of suzerainty through alliance with the tribes. Cyrenaica was subsumed into Ottoman Libya.

In 1879, Cyrenaica became a wilayah of the Ottoman Empire. In 1888, it became a under a &quot;mutasarrif&quot; and was further divided into five qadaas. The wali of Ottoman Tripolitania, however, looked after the military and judicial affairs. The bureaucratic setup was similar to the one in Tripoli. The mutasarrifate existed until the Italian invasion.

=== Italian colonial rule ===


The Italians occupied Cyrenaica during the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 and declared it an Italian protectorate on 15 October 1912. Three days later, the Ottoman Empire officially ceded the province to the Kingdom of Italy. On 17 May 1919, Cyrenaica was established as an Italian colony, and, on 25 October 1920, the Italian government recognized Sheikh Sidi Idriss as the leader of the Senussi, who was granted the princely rank of emir until 1929. In that year, Italy withdrew recognition of him and the Senussi. On 1 January 1934, Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and Fezzan were united as the Italian colony of Libya.

The Italian fascists constructed the Marble Arch as a form of an imperial triumphal arch at the border between Cyrenaica and Tripolitani near the coast.

There was heavy fighting in Cyrenaica during World War II on the part of the Allies against the Italian Army and the Nazi German Afrika Korps. In late 1942, Allied forces liberated Cyrenaica from Axis occupation and the United Kingdom administered most of Libya through 1951, when the Kingdom of Libya was established and granted independence.

=== Emirate of Cyrenaica ===

In 1949, Idris al-Senussi, with British backing, proclaimed the independent Emirate of Cyrenaica. This emirate became part of the Kingdom of Libya when it was established, and an independent kingdom on 24 December 1951, with Idris al-Senussi becoming King Idris.

=== Gaddafi&#x27;s Arab republic ===
Since 1 September 1969, when the Senussi dynasty was overthrown by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Cyrenaica occasionally experienced nationalist activity against Gaddafi&#x27;s military dictatorship, including a military rebellion at Tobruk in 1980.

In 2007, the Green Mountain Conservation and Development Authority, headed by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, announced a regional plan for Cyrenaica, developed by the firm Foster and Partners. The plan, known as The Cyrene Declaration, aimed to revive Cyrenaica&#x27;s agriculture, create a national park and develop the region as a cultural and eco-tourism destination. The announced pilot projects included plans for three hotels, including the Cyrene Grand Hotel near the ruins of Cyrene.

For much of the Libyan civil war, Cyrenaica was largely under the control of the National Transitional Council while Tripolitania and Fezzan remained under Gaddafi&#x27;s government control. Some proposed a &quot;two-state solution&quot; to the conflict, with Cyrenaica becoming an independent state, but this concept was strongly rejected by both sides, and the three regions were united again in October 2011, as rebel forces took Tripolitania and Fezzan and the government collapsed.

Windows Me was targeted specifically at home PC users, and included Internet Explorer 5.5 (which could later be upgraded to Internet Explorer 6), Windows Media Player 7 (which could later be upgraded to Windows Media Player 9 Series), DirectX 7 (which could later be upgraded to DirectX 9) and the new Windows Movie Maker software, which provided basic video editing and was designed to be easy to use for consumers. Microsoft also incorporated features first introduced in Windows 2000, which had been released as a business-oriented operating system seven months earlier, into the graphical user interface, shell and Windows Explorer. Although Windows Me was still ultimately based around MS-DOS like its predecessors, access to real-mode DOS was restricted to decrease system boot time.

Windows Me was initially positively received when it was released; however, it soon garnered a more infamous reputation from many users due to numerous stability problems. In October 2001, Windows XP was released to the public, having already been under development at the time of Windows Me&#x27;s release, and incorporated most, but not all, of the features of Windows Me, while being far more stable due to being based on the Windows NT kernel.

Mainstream support for Windows Me ended on December 31, 2003, followed by extended support on July 11, 2006.

==Development history==
At the 1998 Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, Microsoft CEO Bill Gates stated that Windows 98 would be the last iteration of Windows to use the Windows 9x kernel, with the intention for the next consumer-focused version to be based on the Windows NT kernel, unifying the two branches of Windows. However, it soon became apparent that the development work involved was too great to meet the aim of releasing before the end of 2000, particularly given the ongoing parallel work on the eventually-canceled Neptune project. The Consumer Windows development team was therefore re-tasked with improving Windows 98 while porting some of the look-and-feel from Windows 2000. Microsoft President Steve Ballmer publicly announced these changes at the next Windows HEIC in 1999.

On July 23, 1999, the first alpha version of Windows Me was released to testers. Known as Development Preview 1, it was very similar to Windows 98 SE, with the only major change being a very early iteration of the new Help and Support feature that would appear in the final version. Three more Development Previews were released over the subsequent two months.

The first beta version was released to testers and the industry press on September 24, 1999, with the second coming on November 24 that year. Beta 2 showed the first real changes from Windows 98, including importing much of the look-and-feel from Windows 2000, and the removal of real-mode DOS. Industry expert Paul Thurrott reviewed Beta 2 upon release and spoke positively of it in a review. By early 2000, Windows Me was reportedly behind schedule, and an interim build containing the new automatic update feature was released to allay concerns about a delayed-release.

In February 2000, Paul Thurrott revealed that Microsoft had planned to exclude Windows Me, as well as new releases of Windows NT 4.0, from CD shipments for MSDN subscribers. The reason given in the case of Me was that the OS was designed for consumers. However, Thurrott alleged that the real motivation behind both case to force software developers to move to Windows 2000. Three days later, following a write-in and call-in campaign by hundreds of readers, Microsoft announced that Windows Me (including development versions) would ship to MSDN subscribers after all. Microsoft also apologized personally to Thurrott, claiming he received misinformation, though in a follow-up article he stated that it was &quot;clear that the decision [...] actually changed&quot;.

Beta 3 was released on April 11, 2000, and this version marked the first appearance of its final startup and shutdown sounds derived from Windows 2000, as the previous betas used Windows 98&#x27;s startup and shutdown sounds.

===Release===
Although Microsoft signed off on the final build of Windows Me on June 28, 2000, after trialing three Release Candidate builds with testers, the final retail release was pushed back to September 14 for reasons that were not clear.

Shortly after Windows Me was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, Microsoft launched a marketing campaign to promote it in the U.S., which they dubbed the &quot;Meet Me Tour&quot;. A national partnered promotional program featured the new OS, OEMs and other partners in an interactive multimedia attraction in 25 cities.

Windows Me was released for retail sale on September 14, 2000. At launch time, Microsoft announced a time-limited promotion from September 2000 to January 2001 which entitled Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE users to upgrade to Windows Me for $59.95 instead of the regular retail upgrade price of $109. Non-upgrade versions cost $209, the same as Windows 98 on its release. In October 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, which also included the ZIP folders, the Spider Solitaire game and Internet Explorer 6 by default, all while being based on the Windows NT kernel, which on XP was an evolution of the one in Windows 2000.

==New and updated features==
===User interface===
Windows Me featured the shell enhancements inherited from Windows 2000 such as personalized menus, customizable Windows Explorer toolbars, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, Windows 2000 advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, &quot;Places bar&quot; in common dialogs for &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Save&quot;, cascading Start menu special folders, some Plus! 95 and Plus! 98 themes, and updated graphics. The notification area in Windows Me and later supported 16-bit high color icons. The Multimedia control panel was also updated from Windows 98. &quot;Taskbar and Start Menu&quot; options allowed disabling of the drag and drop feature and could prevent moving or resizing the taskbar, which was easier for new users.

===Hardware support improvements===
* Faster boot times: Windows Me features numerous improvements for improving cold boot time, pre and post-logon boot times and time required for resuming from hibernation. Processing of real mode configuration files, codice_1 and codice_2, is bypassed at startup and essential real mode drivers like codice_3 and codice_4 are embedded into codice_5. The registry is loaded only once; for efficient loading, the registry is split into three files instead of two (codice_6 and codice_7), with the new file codice_8 containing the contents of the hive codice_9 required for boot loaded initially. Plug and Play device enumeration is more parallelized than in Windows 98. Boot time is not affected due to unavailability of a DHCP server or other network components. There are also optimizations to prevent boot slowdown due to BIOS POST operations.
* USB Human Interface Device Class: Generic support for 5-button mice is also included as standard and installing IntelliPoint allows reassigning the programmable buttons.
* Windows Image Acquisition: Windows Me introduced the Windows Image Acquisition API for a standardized method of allowing Windows applications to transparently and more easily communicate with image acquisition devices, such as digital cameras and scanners. WIA intended to improve the configuration and the user interface for interacting with scanners and such devices, (which were previously supported by the TWAIN standard) and simplify writing device drivers for developers. WIA also includes support for USB still image capture device classes such as scanners and cameras through the Picture Transfer Protocol.
* Improved power management and suspend/resume operations: The OEM version of Windows Me supports OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state (hibernation) and other power management features without manufacturer-supplied drivers.
* USB and FireWire support improvements: Windows Me is the only operating system in the Windows 9x series that includes generic drivers for USB mass storage devices and USB printers. Support for FireWire SBP-2 scanners and storage devices is also improved.
* The , DirectSound, and DirectShow APIs support non-PCM formats such as AC-3 or WMA over S/PDIF.

===Media===
* Windows Movie Maker: This utility is based on DirectShow and Windows Media technologies to provide Microsoft Windows computer systems with basic video capture and edit capabilities. It provides users with the ability to capture, edit, and re-encode media content into the Windows Media format, a tightly compressed format that requires a minimal amount of storage space on the computer&#x27;s hard disk when compared to many other media formats.
* Windows Media Player 7: The new version of the Windows multimedia player software introduces jukebox functionality featuring the Media Library, support for CD burning, an integrated media encoder, and the ability to transfer music directly to portable devices. Another new feature is its radio tuner that can be used to search for and connect to radio stations over the internet. Users can also customize the look and feel of the user interface through interactive skins. Windows Me can be upgraded to Windows Media Player 9 Series, which was later included in Windows XP SP2.
* Windows DVD Player: The software DVD player in Windows Me is a redesigned version of the one featured in Windows 98 which, unlike its predecessor, does not require a dedicated decoder card for DVD playback. Instead, it supports software decoding through a third-party decoder.

===Networking technologies===
* Net Crawler: Windows Me introduced a net crawling feature which automatically searches out and creates shortcuts to network shares and printers in &quot;My Network Places&quot;. This can be controlled using the &quot;Automatically search for network folders and printers&quot; option. Shortcuts that are added by the net crawler but not detected again on the network in a reasonable time period are aged out and deleted.
* New TCP/IP Stack: Windows Me includes the Windows 2000 networking stack and architecture.
* The Home Networking Wizard is designed to help users to set up a computer that is running Windows Me for use on a small home network. This includes setting up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) on a computer running Windows Me so the computer can share a connection to the Internet with other computers on the home network.
* Dial-up Networking component was updated in Windows Me and provides several enhancements while maintaining the desired features of prior releases of the operating system. The user interface had been reworked to provide all configurable parameters in one convenient location. The user interface now included three new tabs: &quot;Networking&quot;, &quot;Security&quot; and &quot;Dialing&quot;. To improve dial-up networking, Windows Me includes built-in support for the Connection Manager dial-up client. Using the Connection Manager Administration Kit (an optional networking component in Windows 2000 Server), network administrators can pre-configure and deploy dial-up networking connections, by means of a Connection Manager service profile, to Windows Me–based client machines.
* Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) version 5.0 for Windows Me was enhanced to provide programming interface parity with NDIS version 5.0 in Windows 2000 (the programming interfaces used by network device drivers are the same for both platforms.)
* Universal Plug and Play: Windows Me introduced support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Universal Plug and Play and NAT traversal APIs can also be installed on Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE by installing the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard.

===System utilities===
* System Restore: Windows Me introduced the &quot;System Restore&quot; logging and reversion system, which was meant to simplify troubleshooting and solve problems. It was intended to work as a rollback and recovery feature so that if the installation of an application or a driver adversely affected the system, the user could undo the installation and return the system to a previously working state. It does this by monitoring changes to Windows system files and the registry. System Restore protects only the operating system files, not documents, and therefore is not a substitute for a backup program.
* System File Protection: First introduced with Windows 2000 (as Windows File Protection), and expanding on the capabilities introduced with System File Checker in Windows 98, System File Protection aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the file protection is in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows Me to silently restore the original copy. The original is taken from a hard drive backup folder (codice_10) or from the Windows Me installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. System File Protection is a different technology from System Restore and should not be confused with the latter. System Restore maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas System File Protection protects operating system files with no user input.
* System Configuration Utility allows users to manually extract and restore individual system files from the Windows Me setup files. It has also been updated with three new tabs called &quot;Static VxDs&quot;, &quot;Environment&quot; and &quot;International&quot;. The &quot;Static VxDs&quot; tab allows users to enable or disable static virtual device drivers to be loaded at startup, the &quot;Environment&quot; tab allows users to enable or disable environment variables, and the &quot;International&quot; tab allows users to set international language keyboard layout settings that were formerly set via the real mode MS-DOS configuration files. A &quot;Cleanup&quot; button on the &quot;Startup&quot; tab allows cleaning up invalid or deleted startup entries.
* System Monitor has been updated with a Dial-Up Adapter section. Users can now monitor items such as Connection Speeds, Bytes Received or Transmitted / Second.
* SCANDISK runs from within Windows upon an improper shutdown before the Windows Shell loads.
* Automatic Updates: The Automatic Updates utility automatically downloads and installs critical updates from the Windows Update Web site with little user interaction. It is set up to check Windows Update once every 24 hours by default. Users can choose to download which update they want, although high-priority updates must be downloaded and installed.
* Compressed Folders: Windows Me includes native support for ZIP files through the &#x27;Compressed Folders&#x27; Explorer extension. This extension was originally introduced in the Plus! 98 collection for Windows 98, but is included in the base operating system in Windows Me.
* A new &quot;Help and Support&quot; program has also been added, replacing the HTML Help-based documentation in Windows 2000 and Windows 98. The Help and Support Center is entirely HTML-based and takes advantage of a technology called Support Automation Framework (SAF), that can show support information from the internet, allows collecting data for troubleshooting via WMI and scripting and for third parties to plug into Windows Help and Support. Several other support tools also shipped with Windows Me.
* Windows Me also includes Internet Explorer 5.5, which supports a new Print Preview feature. It also shipped with the MSN Messenger Service.

===Accessibility features===
* On-Screen Keyboard: Originally introduced with Windows 2000, On-Screen Keyboard makes it possible to input characters using the mouse instead of the keyboard.
* The &quot;Mouse&quot; Control Panel incorporates IntelliPoint features, namely ClickLock (selecting or dragging without continuously holding down the mouse button), hiding the pointer while typing, and showing it by pressing &quot;Ctrl&quot;.
* The cursor (system caret) can be set to a thicker width.
* Increased Active Accessibility support in utilities such as Calculator and Magnifier.

==Removed features==
===Real mode DOS===
Windows Me restricted support for real mode MS-DOS. As a result, codice_5 in Windows Me disregards codice_1, codice_13 and codice_14 and directly executes codice_15. In its default configuration the system would neither boot into an MS-DOS command prompt nor exit to DOS from Windows; real mode drivers such as codice_16 could not be loaded and older applications that require real mode could not be run. Microsoft argued that the change improved the speed and reliability of the boot process.

In Windows Me, the codice_17 and codice_18 files are used only to set global environment variables. The two files (if present) are scanned for settings relating to the environment variables, and any other commands present are moved into a Windows registry key (see below). The two files thus contain only settings and preferences which configure the &quot;global environment&quot; for the computer during the boot phase or when starting a new virtual DOS machine (VDM).

To specify or edit other startup values (which, in Windows 98, would be present in the codice_18 file) the user must edit the following Windows registry key:
:codice_20

For troubleshooting and crash recovery, both the Windows Me CD-ROM and the Windows Me startup disk (a user-creatable floppy disk, known as the Emergency Boot Disk (EBD)) allowed booting into real mode MS-DOS.

It is possible to restore real mode DOS functionality through various unofficial means. Additionally, a registry setting exists that re-enables the &quot;Restart in MS-DOS mode&quot; option in the shutdown dialog box; however, unless patched unofficially with third-party software, Windows Me cannot be booted to MS-DOS real mode.

===Other components===
Unlike previous versions of Windows 9x, Windows Me was entirely aimed at home users, and thus had certain enterprise-oriented features removed. Several features of its predecessors did not work or were officially unsupported by Microsoft on Windows Me, including Automated Installation, Active Directory client services, System Policy Editor, Personal Web Server and ASP. These features were supported on the previous versions of Windows 9x. A Resource Kit publication, targeted towards system administrators, was never published for Windows Me.

Other features that were removed or never updated to work with Windows Me included Microsoft Fax, QuickView and DriveSpace, as well as the GUI FAT32 conversion tool. Several Windows Explorer commands were also modified in Windows Me, matching the menu structure in Windows 2000. While some were simply moved to a different location, certain functionality of the Go menu, as well as the Find command on the Tools menu, are no longer available. For the latter change Microsoft recommends using a variety of similar functionality labeled Search.

The Active Channels Channel bar from the original release of Windows 98 was removed like with Windows 98 Second Edition and is not installed upon first boot, but is retained if upgrading from the original release of Windows 98 to Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Me.

Windows Me, like Windows 98 Second Edition, did not ship with the WinG API or RealPlayer 4.0, unlike the original release of Windows 98, due to both of these having been superseded by DirectX and Windows Media Player, respectively.

==Upgradeability==
Windows Me could have its components upgraded or have new components installed up to the latest versions:

* Internet Explorer 6 SP1 and Outlook Express 6 SP1
* Windows Media Format Runtime and Windows Media Player 9 Series (including Windows Media Encoder 7.1 and the Windows Media 8 Decoding Utility)
* MSN Messenger 7.0
* Windows Installer 2.0
* DirectX 9.0c (the latest compatible runtime is from October 2007.)
* .NET Framework 2.0
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 runtime
* Text Services Framework
* Several other components such as MSXML 3.0 SP7, Microsoft Agent 2.0, NetMeeting 3.01, MSAA 2.0, ActiveSync 3.8, WSH 5.6, Microsoft Data Access Components 2.81 SP1, WMI 1.5 and Speech API 4.0.
* Office XP SP3
* The Microsoft Layer for Unicode can be installed to allow certain Unicode applications to run on the operating system.

==System requirements==
The /nm setup switch can be used at the DOS command line to bypass the minimum system requirement checks, allowing for installation on a CPU as low as the 16 MHz 80486SX.

===Limitations===
Windows Me is only designed to handle up to 512 MB of RAM without changes. Systems with larger RAM pools may lose stability; however, depending on the hardware and software configuration, it is sometimes possible to manually tweak the installation to continue working with somewhat larger amounts of RAM as well. The maximum amount of memory the operating system is designed to use is up to 1 GB of RAM. Systems with more than 1.5 GB of RAM may continuously reboot during startup.

==Support lifecycle==
Compared with other releases of Windows, Windows Me had a short shelf-life of just over a year. Windows 2000 and Windows Me were eventually succeeded by newer Microsoft operating systems: Windows Me by Windows XP Home Edition, and Windows 2000 Professional by Windows XP Professional. Windows XP is noteworthy that the first preview build of Windows XP (then codenamed &quot;Whistler&quot;) was released to developers on July 13, 2000, two months before Windows Me&#x27;s general availability date.

Microsoft originally planned to end support for Windows Me on December 31, 2004. However, in order to give customers more time to migrate to newer Windows versions, particularly in developing or emerging markets, Microsoft decided to extend support until July 11, 2006. Microsoft ended support for Windows Me (and Windows 98) on this date because the company considered the operating system to be obsolete and prone to security risks, and recommended customers to upgrade to a newer version of Windows such as Windows XP for the latest security improvements.

Retail availability for Windows Me ended on December 31, 2003. The operating system is no longer available from Microsoft in any form (through MSDN or otherwise) due to the terms of Java-related settlements Microsoft made with Sun Microsystems.

In 2011, Microsoft retired the Windows Update v4 website. An independent project named Windows Update Restored aims to restore the Windows Update websites for older versions of Windows, including Windows Me.

Microsoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows Me (and XP) would end on July 31, 2019.

==Reception==
Windows Me initially received generally positive reviews, with reviewers citing the operating system&#x27;s integrity protection (branded as &quot;PC Health&quot;) and the new System Restore feature as steps forward for home users. Despite this, however, users&#x27; real-world experience did not bear this out, with industry publications receiving myriad reports of problems with the &quot;PC Health&quot; systems, PCs refusing to shut down cleanly, and general stability problems.

As time went on, reception of Windows Me became more negative, to the point where it was heavily panned by users, mainly due to stability issues. Retrospectively, Windows Me is viewed as one of the worst operating systems of all time, being unfavorably compared to its immediate predecessor and successor. A &quot;PC World&quot; article dubbed Windows Me the &quot;Mistake Edition&quot; and placed it 4th in their &quot;Worst Tech Products of All Time&quot; feature in 2006. The article states: &quot;Shortly after Me appeared in late 2000, users reported problems installing it, getting it to run, getting it to work with other hardware or software, and getting it to stop running.&quot; Consequently, most home users remained with Windows 98, while some moved to Windows 2000 despite the latter being enterprise-oriented. In the Netherlands, Windows Me was infamously known as &quot;Windows Meer Ellende&quot; (Dutch for &quot;more misery&quot;).

System Restore suffered from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System Restore to incorrectly date-stamp snapshots that were taken after September 8, 2001. This could prevent System Restore from locating these snapshots and cause the system restore process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem. 

Byron Hinson and Julien Jay, writing for ActiveWin, took an appreciative look on the operating system. On the removal of real mode DOS support, they had noted &quot;The removal of DOS has clearly made a difference in Windows Me in terms of stability (far less Blue Screens of Death are seen now) and booting speed has greatly increased.&quot; In a recommendation of the operating system upgrade for users of Windows 95 and 98, they had stated &quot;If Windows Me isn&#x27;t a revolutionary OS it&#x27;s clear that Microsoft has focused its efforts to make it more user-friendly, stable and packed full of multimedia options. The result is great and the enhancements added are really worth the wait.&quot; The new features that Windows Me introduced were also praised and have since remained part of subsequent Windows versions.

Along with Windows 2000 from the Windows NT family, Windows Me was the last version of Windows that lacked product activation.

<text>Numidia was the ancient kingdom of the Numidians in northwest Africa, initially comprising the territory that now makes up Algeria, but later expanding across what is today known as Tunisia and Libya. The polity was originally divided between the Massylii state in the east (Capital: Cirta) and the Masaesyli state in the west (Capital: Siga). During the Second Punic War (218–201 BC), Masinissa, king of the Massylii, defeated Syphax of the Masaesyli to unify Numidia into the first unified Berber state for Numidians in present-day Algeria. The kingdom began as a sovereign state and an ally of Rome and later alternated between being a Roman province and a Roman client state.

Numidia, at its foundation, was bordered by the Moulouya River to the west, Africa Proconsularis and Cyrenaica to the east. the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Sahara to the south so that Numidia entirely surrounded Carthage except towards the sea. before Masinissa expanded past the Moulouya and vassalizing Bokkar, and reaching the Atlantic ocean to the west.

== Name ==
The Greek historians referred to these peoples as &quot;Νομάδες&quot; (i.e. Nomads), which by Latin interpretation became &quot;Numidae&quot; (but cf. also the correct use of &quot;Nomades&quot;). Historian Gabriel Camps, however, disputes this claim, favoring instead a local African origin for the term.

Despite their presence, the Numidians are scarcely mentioned in Greek and Roman historical accounts until the First Punic War (264–241 BC), when the Greek historian Polybius first noted their cavalry. He also indicated the peoples and territory west of Carthage including the entire north of Algeria as far as the river Mulucha (Muluya), about west of Oran.
==History==

=== Background ===
The Numidians were a nomadic tribal people who inhabited North Africa, specifically the regions that now form northern Algeria and western Tunisia, during the final three centuries of the first millennium BC. Their lands bordered the Carthaginian hinterlands in eastern Tunisia to the east, the territory of the Mauri tribes to the west, and the Saharan edge occupied by the Gaetulians to the south. 

By the time of the Second Punic War in 218 BC, the previously scattered Numidian tribes had consolidated into two great and rival tribal groups: the Massylii in eastern Numidia, and the Masaesyli in the west. During the first part of the Second Punic War, the eastern Massylii, under their king Gala, were allied with Carthage, while the western Masaesyli, under king Syphax, were allied with Rome. The Kingdom of Masaesyli under Syphax extended from the Moulouya river to Oued Rhumel. The Romans worked hard to cultivate Syphax&#x27;s friendship, and helped to train his troops in the techniques of infantry warfare. 

Syphax initially defeated Gala, but Gala’s son Masinissa, raised in Carthage, rallied forces and defeated Syphax twice by 212 BC, forcing him to flee. Masinissa then joined the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal Barca in Spain, where he played a key role in Carthaginian victories against Rome. After Gala’s death, Carthage stripped Masinissa’s family of their lands, prompting him to ally with Rome. Returning to Africa, he initially partnered with Syphax against Carthage. However, Hasdrubal married his daughter Sophonisba to Syphax, securing his loyalty to Carthage. Syphax defeated Masinissa twice in 205 BC, forcing him to retreat into the mountains, where he waged a guerrilla campaign, eluding capture and eventually joining forces with Scipio’s Roman army. In 204 BC, the Roman general Scipio Africanus landed in Africa with Roman forces, joined by Masinissa, whose tactical brilliance became evident when he helped destroy a combined Carthaginian-Numidian camp and later defeated Syphax and Hasdrubal at the Battle of Cirta in 203 BC. Masinissa captured Syphax and married Sophonisba, but Scipio, wary of her Carthaginian loyalty, demanded her surrender. To avoid enslavement, Sophonisba took poison, dying in 203 BC.

=== Establishment and apogee ===

Masinissa regained his father&#x27;s kingdom, and also took control of much of Syphax&#x27;s territory. The Second Punic War ended with a Roman victory at the battle of Zama in 202 BC, and Masinissa of the Massylii consolidated his position as the first king of a united Numidia with enthusiastic Roman patronage. The Romans were determined to keep a powerful ally in Africa to prevent the Carthaginians from threatening their hard-won hegemony in the western Mediterranean.

Massinissa, constantly encroaching on the territory left to the Carthaginians, had, by 158 BC, conquered Lepcis Magna and the Tripolitanian coast, bringing under his authority all the Berber tribes established between Cyrenaica and the Ampsaga River. Masinissa&#x27;s territory extended from the Mulucha river to the boundary of the Carthaginian territory, and also southeast as far as Cyrenaica to the gulf of Sirte, so that Numidia entirely surrounded Carthage (Appian, &quot;Punica&quot;, 106) except towards the sea. Furthermore, after the capture of Syphax the king of the Masaesyli (West Algeria) with his capital based in Siga and after losing Siga had relocated to a temporary capital in Tinga, Bokkar, had become a vassal of Massinissa. Massinissa had also penetrated as far south beyond the Atlas to the Gaetuli and Fezzan was part of his domain.

Settled in Cirta, where he surrounded himself with the refinements of Greek and Roman civilizations, Masinissa disciplined his Berbers and trained them in agricultural work. Carthage, complaining about Massinissa’s encroachments as he had taken control of most of the emporia or African ports, thereby ruining its trade, appealed to Rome, which sent commissioners to investigate the grievances on-site. Among these envoys was Marcus Cato, who, upon observing the rapid recovery of Carthage, whose fleet and army had been rebuilt, advocated for the destruction of the Punic metropolis. He concluded all his reports and speeches with the words: “Moreover, I think Carthage must be destroyed.” 

Rome, seeking a pretext for further intervention, found one when Massinissa attacked the Punic city of Oroscopa. Hasdrubal, leading a force of 30,000 men to relieve the city, was decisively defeated by Gulussa, Massinissa’s son, in 150 BC. Learning that Carthage had waged war against a prince allied with Rome, the Romans dispatched an army of 80,000 men to Africa. In 146 BC Carthage was obliterated by the armies of Consul Scipio Aemilianus in what is known as the Third Punic War. The victors reduced Carthage’s territory to a Roman province, which they named the “Province of Africa.”Masinissa ruled for 55 years until his death in 148 BC, shortly before Rome’s destruction of Carthage in 146 BC. Micipsa succeeded him, reigning for another 30 years. The three sons of Massinissa jointly ruled Numidia, under Roman oversight. At the request of Masinissa, Scipio Aemilianus arranged a division of Masinissa&#x27;s kingdom and inheritance. Micipsa managed the palace and the treasury in Cira, Gulussa was given command of the Numidian army and Mastanabal was appointed chief Judicial authority in the kingdom. On the death of his two brothers in 145 BC, Micipsa, finding himself sole heir to the kingdom of Massinissa, reigned in Cirta, with the help of his two sons Adherbal and Hiempsal I, and his nephew Jugurtha, son of his brother Manastabal.

Under Masinissa and his son Micipsa, Numidia flourished. During this era of stability, Numidia advanced significantly. Settled agriculture expanded alongside traditional pastoralism, towns grew more urbanized, and trade flourished through access to former Carthaginian ports. The kingdom maintained Roman favor by supplying grain and military auxiliaries, including cavalry, infantry, and elephants. The Numidian kings tried to involve themselves in the Greek-dominated Hellenistic culture of the eastern Mediterranean. In their coin portraits, Masinissa and Micipsa often wore a diadem, a white ribbon tied around the head and recognized as a Hellenistic symbol of monarchy. They financed the construction of Greek-style buildings in their cities, and one of Masinissa&#x27;s sons even competed in the Panathenaic Games.

===War with Rome===

When Micipsa died in 118 BC, he was succeeded jointly by his two sons Hiempsal I and Adherbal and Jugurtha, who was very popular among the Numidians. Hiempsal and Jugurtha quarrelled immediately after the death of Micipsa. Jugurtha orchestrated the assassination of his cousin Hiempsal and expelled his other cousin, Adherbal, from Cirta. Adherbal fled to Rome to seek the Senate’s protection. However, Jugurtha had already bribed influential Romans, prompting the Senate to divide Numidia in 114 BCE: western Numidia was given to Jugurtha, while Adherbal retained the eastern portion. Jugurtha, having married the daughter of Bocchus, king of the western Mauri, amassed a large army and invaded Adherbal’s territory in 112 BC. Adherbal retreated to Cirta, where he endured a two-year siege. Starving, he surrendered, but Jugurtha executed him along with many Italians living in the city. Summoned before the Senate for this act, Jugurtha escaped punishment by bribing senators. Before leaving Rome, he assassinated Massiva, the son of Gulussa, who had lodged complaints against him. As he departed, Jugurtha famously declared, “O venal city, doomed to perish if it finds a buyer!” 

Determined to end Jugurtha’s defiance, Rome sent the propraetor Aulus against him in 109 BCE. However, Aulus was ambushed near Suthul and forced to pass under the yoke with his soldiers. Consul Metellus then took command, leading an indecisive battle against Jugurtha’s forces near Theveste but later being compelled to retreat near Zama in 108 BCE. In 107 BCE, after regrouping, Metellus invaded Numidia, pushing Jugurtha’s Berber forces into retreat and capturing Cirta. Jugurtha fled to the Gaetulians and sought aid from Bocchus. Metellus was recalled and replaced by Consul Marius, who led an army of 50,000 men. Marius defeated the combined forces of Jugurtha and Bocchus near Sitifis after a three-day battle and returned to Cirta. Bocchus sought peace and, at the urging of Marius’s lieutenant Sulla, betrayed Jugurtha. Luring his son-in-law into his camp, Bocchus handed Jugurtha over to the Romans in 106 BCE. On January 1, 104 BCE, Marius celebrated a triumph in Rome, with the captured Jugurtha paraded in chains. That same evening, Jugurtha was thrown into the Tullianum prison, where he soon died from cold and starvation.

===Divided kingdom===
After the death of Jugurtha, western Numidia, which was now called Mauretania, was added to the lands of Bocchus I. Meanwhile, Gauda, another son of Manastabal who had remained loyal to Rome, was granted central Numidia. After Gauda’s death shortly thereafter, his sons Hiempsal II and Hiarbas divided their father’s kingdom, ruling under Roman supervision. These Numidian and Mauretanian kings, as Roman protégés, frequently traveled to Rome, where their children were often educated and held as hostages to ensure their loyalty. Fluent in Latin and living according to Roman customs, they supported the arts, beautified their cities in Roman style, and developed their lands, which supplied Italy with a variety of agricultural products. Italians were also settled in fertile regions of Berber lands, often on lands confiscated from the indigenous population. This contributed to the increasing Romanization of North Africa. 

The kings of Numidia and Mauretania often took advantage of Roman internal conflicts to settle their own disputes. During the civil war between Marius and Sulla, Marius, exiled by Sulla, sought refuge with Hiarbas, while Hiempsal II supported the dictator Sulla in 88 BC. Hiarbas, with the help of Marius’s supporters, defeated his brother Hiempsal and seized his kingdom. To counter Hiarbas and the Marian faction he had revived in Africa, Sulla sent Gnaeus Pompey with six legions. Bocchus supported Pompey’s forces with a large contingent of Mauretanian cavalry commanded by Gauda, the son of his son Bogud. Hiarbas, defeated by Pompey and besieged in Bulla Regia, was eventually forced to surrender to Gauda and was executed after enduring severe torture. Hiempsal II regained his kingdom and was granted Hiarbas’s former territory in 81 BC. Around the same time, Bocchus died, and Mauretania was divided between his two sons: Bocchus II, who ruled the eastern part of the kingdom with the old Punic city of Iol as his capital, and Bogud, who inherited the western part with Tingi as its center.

=== Roman civil war and the end of the Numidian Kingdom ===
Juba, succeeding his father Hiempsal II in 50 BC, sought to take advantage of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey to free himself from Roman control. From the city of Hippo, which he made his capital, he rallied exiles who helped him organize his native troops effectively. After Caesar took Italy from the Senate’s faction, Attius Varus, a lieutenant of Pompey and leader of the senatorial army, proclaimed his general’s authority in Africa and allied with Juba. Together, they defeated the army of Gaius Scribonius Curio, Caesar’s lieutenant, at the Battle of the Bagradas in July 49 BC. Following Pompey’s orders, Varus blocked African ports to halt shipments of goods, leading to famine in Italy, where even slaves began to starve. However, an agreement was reached between the rival leaders, who, realizing the need to avoid depopulating Italy, eventually neutralized the food embargo.

After the Alexandrian War in Ptolemaic egypt ended favorably for Caesar. He installed Cleopatra as queen of Egypt, who bore him a son, Caesarion, and moved on to suppress a revolt in Armenia. He famously summarized this brief campaign, known as the Pontic War, with the words: “I came, I saw, I conquered.” The remnants of Pompey’s forces, having regrouped in Africa under Varus, were joined by Labienus (a former lieutenant of Caesar), Metellus Scipio (Pompey’s father-in-law), Afranius, Porcius Cato, and Gnaeus Pompey. With Juba’s support and his Berber troops, the republican army held off Caesar, forcing him to launch a new campaign against them. 

From Rome, Caesar negotiated with Publius Sittius, a Campanian adventurer commanding a small army of Italians, Gauls, Spaniards, and Berbers in Africa. Promising Bocchus II and Bogud portions of Juba’s territory if they supported him, Caesar landed near Hadrumetum in November 47 BC. Initially outnumbered, with only 5,000 soldiers against his opponents’ 60,000, Caesar failed to take Hadrumetum but gained the allegiance of Ruspina and Leptis Parva. Meanwhile, his quaestor Sallustius Crispus captured the Cercina Islands, a key supply base for Pompey’s forces. Sittius captured Cirta, threatening Juba’s rear and forcing him to divert forces to deal with the insurgent Gaetulians. Reinforced with 30,000 men at Ruspina, Caesar besieged Thapsus. On February 6, 46 BC, he decisively defeated the allied forces attempting to relieve the city. Juba, attempting to reach Zama-Regia, found its gates closed and was killed by a slave as Caesar entered the city in triumph. Scipio, cornered by Sittius’s sailors in the Gulf of Hippo, stabbed himself and drowned.

Victorious, Caesar sent Juba I’s son to Rome, where he was educated in Roman culture and loyalty to its power. Caesar annexed eastern Numidia into the Roman province of Africa Nova, appointing his lieutenant Sallustius Crispus as governor. Sallust exploited the province, amassing wealth under the pretext of punishing it for supporting Pompey. Bocchus II was granted additional territory in Mauretania Sitifensis, while Bogud received western Numidia. Sittius, made legate, was awarded Cirta and its dependencies, taken from Masanasses, an ally of Juba. The surviving republican leaders fled to Spain, where Caesar, reinforced by Berber contingents under Bogud, defeated the Pompeian forces at Munda the following year. This marked the end of significant resistance to Caesar. Eastern Numidia was annexed in 46 BC to create a new Roman province, Africa Nova. Western Numidia was also annexed as part of the province Africa Nova after the death of its last king, Arabio, in 40 BC, and subsequently the province (except of western Numidia) was united with province Africa Vetus by Emperor Augustus in 25 BC, to create the new province Africa Proconsularis. During the brief period (30–25 BC) Juba II (son of Juba I) ruled as a client king of Numidia on the territory of former province Africa Nova.

== Armed forces ==

=== Numidian cavalry ===

The Numidian cavalry were renowned as the most effective light cavalry in the ancient Mediterranean, playing a crucial role in the armies of both Carthage and Rome. Despite their lack of armor, simple weaponry, and rudimentary tack, their unmatched horsemanship made them invaluable. Numidian riders, trained from childhood, mastered riding without saddles or bridles, using only a simple rein and wooden rod to guide their hardy, fast, and low-maintenance horses. Their close bond with their mounts enabled remarkable feats, such as switching to a spare horse mid-battle. Their distinctive tactics relied on speed and mobility. Using hit-and-run strategies, they would harass enemy formations with javelins while avoiding direct combat. This approach, developed from the raiding practices of North African nomads, minimized casualties while disrupting opponents. Notably, they excelled at reconnaissance, raiding, and supporting larger armies by keeping enemies off-balance. Numidian cavalry played pivotal roles in major conflicts, such as Hannibal’s campaigns during the Second Punic War and Scipio Africanus’ victory at Zama in 202 BC. After Rome’s alliance with the Numidian king Masinissa, these horsemen became essential auxiliaries, fighting in wars across the Mediterranean. Even after Numidia’s absorption into the Roman Empire, their tactics and equipment remained largely unchanged, with Numidian cavalry continuing to serve in policing and military campaigns well into the Roman imperial period.

=== Elephants ===
The Numidian kings supplied African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) to the Romans, who used them in key battles such as Pydna (168 BC) and the siege of Numantia (134 BC). These elephants, smaller than bush elephants, were adopted from the Carthaginians, who used them effectively during the Punic Wars, including Hannibal’s famous Alpine crossing. Initially, Carthaginian elephants carried only a mahout, as their size and ferocity were sufficient for combat. However, by the 1st century BC, Numidian elephants were equipped with turrets, as seen during Juba I’s alliance with the Romans and Caesar’s capture of 64 elephants at Thapsus (46 BC). Despite their utility, elephants could be unpredictable, as demonstrated during the siege of Numantia, where one enraged elephant caused chaos, trampling both allies and enemies.

== Agriculture ==
The Numidian kingdom was very famous for its agricultural yield; besides lettuce, beans, and other grains already consumed by Berbers since the dawn of their recorded history, Numidia was very productive when it came to its famously high-quality wheat, very similar to the wheat farmed along the banks of the Egyptian Nile. According to Roman historian Pliny the elder:

In 179 BC, King Masinissa of Numidia received a golden crown from the inhabitants of Delos, as he had offered them a shipload of grain. A statue of Masinissa was erected in Delos in his honor, with an inscription by a native from Rhodes. His sons, too, had statues erected on the island of Delos; the King of Bithynia, Nicomedes, had also dedicated a statue to Masinissa. By 143 AD, the export of olive oil from Numidia rivaled its grain export throughout the Roman Empire.

In 200 BC, the Roman Army stationed in Macedonia received 17,508 hectoliters of Numidian wheat; in 198 BC, the Roman Army in Greece was sent, once again, the same amount of wheat. In 191 BC, Rome received 26,262 hectoliters of wheat and 21,885 hectoliters of barley; Greece, the same year, received 43,770 hectoliters of wheat and 26,262 hectoliters of barley. Then, in 171 BC, the Roman army in Macedonia received 87,540 hectoliters of wheat.

In total Rome received:
* in 200 BC: 14,000 tonnes of wheat and 10,500 tonnes of barley.
* in 198 BC: 14,000 tonnes of wheat.
* in 191 BC: 56,000 tonnes of wheat and 28,900 tonnes of barley.
* in 170 BC: 70,000 tonnes of wheat.

These numbers only represent a fraction from the reserves of the kingdom of Massinissa. His contributions to the Romans in 170 BC appear to be only a fraction of the kingdom&#x27;s total production, as he was upset by Rome&#x27;s decision to pay for the provided wheat that year. Massinissa hadn&#x27;t laid his hands yet on the fertile lands of the Emporia (North West Ancient Libya) nor the great plains full of fertile soil yet; generally, barley was his kingdom&#x27;s main produce, as they grew barley in light, mountainous and hilly soil which is suitable for its cultivation.

==Culture==

=== Architecture ===
The term “Royal Numidian Architecture” was coined for the monuments that were constructed by the Numidian kings. These monuments consist of tombs, tumuli and sanctuaries. Some examples of these structures are the mausoleum of Thugga, the tomb of Beni Rhenane, a tomb at Henchur Burgu in Djerba as well as two tumulus tombs known as the Madghacen and the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania. There are also altars that were built at Simitthus and Kbor Klib. All of these monuments were built within the area ruled by Massinissa and his descendants.

=== Religion ===
Massinissa had a profound influence on religion in his kingdom. During his reign, urban areas worshipped Baal Hammon and other Phoenician deities, while rural communities venerated local gods and spirits. Some Libyan groups also worshipped celestial bodies such as the Sun and Moon. Massinissa, despite his openness to foreign influences, did not abandon traditional African beliefs. When he welcomed Roman consul Publius Cornelius Scipio, he expressed his gratitude in a distinctly African manner, saying: “I give thanks to you, O Great Sun, and to you, other gods of the heavens.” This invocation highlights his reverence for the solar deity. Massinissa, influenced by Phoenician civilization, allowed the worship of Phoenician gods in urban centers. As an admirer of Greek culture, he likely introduced the Numidians to the Greek cult of Demeter and Persephone (Ceres), a fertility religion involving rituals aimed at promoting agricultural productivity. These rites often included crude and provocative elements, reflecting their connection to natural cycles and fertility.
==Trade==
The significance of trade in the Numidian kingdom is evident from the development of coinage. Many coins depict a bearded figure on one side and a free, galloping or rearing horse on the other. Some coins bear the inscriptions “MN,” an abbreviation for Massinissa (MSNSN), or “MKWSN” (Micipsa). While coin minting in Numidia predates Massinissa, it expanded significantly during his reign. This increase in coin circulation is attributed to Massinissa, particularly as the largest number of coins has been discovered around Constantine. These coins, made of lead or bronze, were used for domestic trade. Trade also involved rural populations paying taxes in grain. For foreign commerce, Massinissa received gold and silver coins from other nations in exchange for Numidian exports such as grain, ivory, ostrich feathers and eggs, exotic animals for circuses, and wood. 

The Numidian kingdom maintained trade relations with the Iberian Peninsula, Carthage, and Rome, as well as the Greek world, including Rhodes, Athens, and Delos. Grain was the primary export. Historian Camps, referencing Livy, provides detailed records of Numidian grain exports to Rome: 14,000 quintals of wheat and 10,500 quintals of barley in 200 BCE, 14,000 quintals of wheat in 198 BCE, 56,000 quintals of wheat and 28,000 quintals of barley in 191 BCE, and 70,000 quintals of wheat in 170 BCE. 

Massinissa used to provide to the population of Rhodes Toja wood and Ivory, in Cirta multiple Rhodian amphorae from the 2nd century B.C were found in burial sites and one of them carries the inscription (Sodamos). Massinissa encouraged Greek merchants to settle in his cities and welcomed figures like the historian Polybius. During his reign, North Africa established direct trade connections with both the East and the West, bypassing Carthage. This transformation was largely due to Massinissa’s efforts. Religion

Numidia took over most of the famous Carthaginian ports which were one of the most important in the mediterranean, the famous Roman orator and historian Cicero tells us that the Numidian king had a war navy to protect his trade, in one story, the fleet of Massinissa sailed to Malta and confiscated large ivory elephant pillars from the temple of Juno and returned to Numidia and gave it as a prize to Massinissa. When the king knew about the origin of the gift, he prepared a nimble fleet of five ships and sent it back to where it came from. This funny story tells us that not only Massinissa had enough ships to perform tasks at will but also these fleets were functioning outside of African shorelines towards the central mediterranean.

== Major cities ==
Numidia became highly romanized and was studded with numerous towns. The chief towns of Roman Numidia were: in the north, Cirta or modern Constantine, the capital, with its port Russicada (Modern Skikda); and Hippo Regius (near Bône), well known as the see of St. Augustine. To the south in the interior military roads led to Theveste (Tebessa) and Lambaesis (Lambessa) with extensive Roman remains, connected by military roads with Cirta and Hippo, respectively.

Lambaesis was the seat of the Legio III &quot;Augusta&quot;, and the most important strategic centre. It commanded the passes of the Aurès Mountains (Mons Aurasius), a mountain block that separated Numidia from the Gaetuli Berber tribes of the desert, and which was gradually occupied in its whole extent by the Romans under the Empire. Including these towns, there were altogether twenty that are known to have received at one time or another the title and status of Roman colonies; and in the 5th century, the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; enumerates no fewer than 123 sees whose bishops assembled at Carthage in 479.

<text>Cilicia () is a geographical region in southern Anatolia, extending inland from the northeastern coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. Cilicia has a population ranging over six million, concentrated mostly at the Cilician plain (). The region includes the provinces of Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye and Hatay.

== Name ==
The name of Cilicia () was derived from (), which was the name used by the Neo-Assyrian Empire to designate the western part of what would become Cilicia.

The English spelling is the same as the Latin, as it was transliterated directly from the Greek form Κιλικία. The palatalization of c occurring in Western Europe in later Vulgar Latin () accounts for its modern pronunciation in English.

== Geography ==
Cilicia extends along the Mediterranean coast east from Pamphylia to the Nur Mountains, which separate it from Syria. North and east of Cilicia stand the rugged Taurus Mountains, which separate it from the high central plateau of Anatolia, and which are pierced by a narrow gorge called in antiquity the Cilician Gates. Ancient Cilicia was naturally divided into Cilicia Trachea (, west of the Limonlu River) and Cilicia Pedias (, east of the Limonlu). Salamis, the city on the east coast of Cyprus, was included in the Roman province of Cilicia from 58 BC until 27 BC.

Cilicia consisted of two main contrasting regions:
* to the west was a mountainous region characterised by rough terrain, corresponding to the Neo-Assyrian period territory of and the Graeco-Roman region of Rough Cilicia;
* to the east was a fertile region defined by a smooth terrain, corresponding to the Neo-Assyrian period territory of and the Graeco-Roman region of Plain Cilicia.

=== Rough Cilicia ===
Rough Cilicia (; ; ; ) is a rugged mountain district formed by the spurs of Taurus, which often terminate in rocky headlands with small sheltered harbours, features which, in classical times, made the coast a string of havens for pirates and, in the Middle Ages, outposts for Genoese and Venetian traders. The district is watered by the Calycadnus and was covered in ancient times by forests that supplied timber to Phoenicia and Egypt. Cilicia lacked large cities.

=== Plain Cilicia ===
Plain Cilicia (; ; ; ), to the east, included the rugged spurs of Taurus and a large coastal plain, with rich loamy soil, known to Greeks such as Xenophon (who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand,) for its abundance (&quot;euthemia&quot;), filled with sesame and millet and olives and pasturage for the horses imported into ancient Israel by King Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified.

The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus Çay Berdan River), the Sarus (Seyhan), and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, and that the united rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of Tarsus (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, Adana (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Cilicia shows significant differences between the mountains and the lower plains. At the lower plains, the climate reflects a typical Mediterranean style; summers are hot while winters are mild, making the land, particularly, the eastern plains, fertile. In the coldest month (January), the average temperature is 9 °C, and in the warmest month (August), the average temperature is 28 °C. The mountains of Cilicia have an inland climate with snowy winters. The average annual precipitation in the region is 647 mm and the average number of rainy days in a year is 76. Mersin and surrounding areas have the highest average temperature in Cilicia. Mersin also has high annual precipitation (1096 mm) and 85 rainy days in a year.

=== Geology ===

The mountains of Cilicia are formed from ancient limestones, conglomerate, marlstone, and similar materials. The Taurus Mountains are composed of karstic limestone, while its soil is also limestone-derived, with pockets of volcanic soil. The lower plain is the largest alluvial plain in Turkey. Expansion of limestone formations and fourth-era alluvials brought by the rivers Seyhan and Ceyhan formed the plains of the region over the course of time.

Akyatan, Akyayan, Salt Lake, Seven lakes at Aladağ, and Karstik Dipsiz lake near Karaisalı are the lakes of the region. The reservoirs in the region are Seyhan, Çatalan, Yedigöze, Kozan and Mehmetli.

The major rivers in Cilicia are Seyhan, Ceyhan, Berdan (Tarsus), Asi and Göksu.

* Seyhan River emerges from the confluence of Zamantı and Göksu rivers which originate from Kayseri Province and flows into the Gulf of Mersin. The river is 560 km long.
* Ceyhan River emerges from the confluence of the Aksu and Hurman rivers and flows towards Cape Hürmüz at the Gulf of İskenderun. It is 509 km long and it forms the Akyayan, Akyatan, and Kakarat lakes before flowing into the Mediterranean.
* Berdan River originates from the Taurus Mountains and flows into the Mediterranean south of Tarsus.
* Göksu river originates from the Taurus Mountains and flows into the Mediterranean 16 km southeast of Silifke. It forms the Göksu Delta, including Akgöl Lake and Paradeniz Lagoon.

== History ==

=== Neolithic ===
Cilicia was settled from the Neolithic period onwards. Dating of the ancient settlements of the region from Neolithic to Bronze Age is as follows: Aceramic/Neolithic: 8th and 7th millennia BC; Early Chalcolithic: 5800 BC; Middle Chalcolithic (correlated with Halaf and Ubaid developments in the east): c. 5400–4500 BC; Late Chalcolithic: 4500 – c. 3400 BC; and Early Bronze Age IA: 3400–3000 BC; EBA IB: 3000–2700 BC; EBA II: 2700–2400 BC; EBA III A-B: 2400–2000 BC.
=== Bronze Age ===
The area had been known as Kizzuwatna in the earlier Hittite era (2nd millennium BC). The region was divided into two parts, &quot;plain&quot; Cilicia (Uru Adaniya), a well-watered plain, and &quot;rough&quot; Cilicia (Tarza), in the mountainous west.
There exists evidence that circa 1650 BC both Hittite kings Hattusili I and Mursili I enjoyed the freedom of movement along the Pyramus River (now the Ceyhan River in southern Turkey), proving they exerted strong control over Cilicia in their battles with Syria. After the death of Murshili around 1595 BC, Hurrians wrested control from the Hittites, and Cilicia was free for two centuries. The first king of free Cilicia, Išputahšu, son of Pariyawatri, was recorded as a &quot;great king&quot; in both cuneiform and Hittite hieroglyphs. Another record of Hittite origins, a treaty between Išputahšu and Telipinu, king of the Hittites, is recorded in both Hittite and Akkadian.

In the next century, the Cilician king Pilliya finalized treaties with both King Zidanta II of the Hittites and Idrimi of Alalakh, in which Idrimi mentions that he had assaulted several military targets throughout Eastern Cilicia. Niqmepa, who succeeded Idrimi as king of Alalakh, went so far as to ask for help from a Hurrian rival, Shaushtatar of Mitanni, to try and reduce Cilicia&#x27;s power in the region. It was soon apparent, however, that increased Hittite power would soon prove Niqmepa&#x27;s efforts to be futile, as the city of Kizzuwatna soon fell to the Hittites, threatening all of Cilicia. Soon after, King Sunassura II was forced to accept vassalization under the Hittites, becoming the last king of ancient Cilicia. After the death of Mursili I, which led to a power struggle among rival claimants to the throne, eventually leading to the collapse of Hittite supremacy, Cilicia appeared to have regained its independence.

In the 13th century BC a major population shift occurred as the Sea Peoples overran Cilicia. The Hurrians that resided there deserted the area and moved northeast towards the Taurus Mountains, where they settled in the area of Cappadocia.

=== Iron Age ===

During the early and middle of the Iron Age, Cilicia was dominated by two main polities:
* in the east was Ḫiyawa, corresponding to Plain Cilicia, and referred to as in Neo-Assyrian sources and as in Neo-Babylonian sources;
* in the west, corresponding to Rough Cilicia, was the state referred to as in Neo-Assyrian sources and as in Neo-Babylonian sources.

==== Kingdom of Cilicia ====
In the 6th century BC, an independent state, called Cilicia () by the ancient Greeks, was established in southeastern Anatolia under the rule of a native dynasty, with its capital of Cilicia at the city of Tarsus.

Cilicia and Cilicians do not appear in any extant list of people ruled by the Achaemenid Empire.

The Greek designation of extended the use of the name of the state of Ḫilakku to the territory of both Ḫilakku and its neighbour Ḫiyawa. It is however uncertain how this naming convention arose, and whether it was the result of political expansion by Ḫilakku or of Greeks first coming into contact with Ḫilakku and using its name for all the Luwian populations of eastern Anatolia is unknown.

The earliest known ruler, and possibly the founder, of the kingdom of Cilicia was Syennesis I, who, according to the Ancient Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus, mediated in 585 BC the peace treaty which followed the end of the conflict which had opposed the Lydian and Median empires.

Herodotus of Halicarnassus also claimed that the Cilicians and the Lycians were the only peoples of Anatolia who had not been conquered by the Lydian king Croesus. However, it is unknown whether this means that the Cilicians and Lycians were able to resist the Lydian conquest, or whether Croesus did not find any interest in annexing them.

===== Submission to the Achaemenid Empire =====
In the mid-6th century BC, the kingdom of Cilicia supported the founding king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, Cyrus II, in his wars against Croesus of Lydia, as a consequence of which Cilicia became a vassal of the Achaemenid empire as from , and the Cilician rulers became part of the Achaemenid administration.

Under early Achaemenid rule, Cilicia maintained a significant degree of autonomy and the native rulers acted as satraps (governors) for the Achaemenid administration, with their authority extending until as far west as Aspendus.

Cilicia during the Achaemenid period was inhabited by tribal populations who were led by native chieftains, and it contained fortified strongholds protecting its agricultural land and its inhabitants, as well as various native and Persian cities and towns.

Nevertheless, the western pert of Cilicia, corresponding to the later Graeco-Roman Rough Cilicia, probably remained independent of Persian rule and of the administration of the satrap of Tarsus except for the narrow strip of flat land along its coast, due to which the imperial authorities often led repressive measures against these inhabitants of the hilly regions.

During the reign of the Achaemenid king of kings Darius I, Cilicia was used as an assembly point for the military forces which Mardonius used to campaign in Europe as well as those which Datis and Artaphernes used to campaign against both the Asian and European Greeks.

Under Darius I&#x27;s successor, Xerxes I, Cilicia contributed both troops and ships for the Achaemenid conquest of the Aegean Sea: the Cilician ruler Syennesis II led these ships, but was killed in battle. At this time, the ruling dynasty of Cilicia had been linked by marriage bonds with Carian notables.

Syennesis II was succeeded by one Xeinagoras of Halicarnassus, who had no previous ties to Cilicia and was appointed as satrap of Cilicia by Xerxes I as reward for his service.

Cilicia remained under efficient administration, and it would continue to provide troops for the Achaemenid wars in Anatolia, Egypt and Cyprus.

==== Satrapy of Cilicia ====
In 401 BC, the Achaemenid king of kings Artaxerxes II abolished the autonomy of Cilicia in reaction to the local Cilician ruler Syennesis III&#x27;s support for the rebellion of Cyrus the Younger, resulting in the kingdom of Cilicia being abolished and fully integrated into the Achaemenid empire as a province ruled by and appointed by the Achaemenid king of kings, which it would remain until the end of the Achaemenid Empire in 333 BC.

Once the revolt of Cyrus the Younger had been suppressed, Cilicia was again used as an assembly point for Achaemenid forces in preparation for military action in the Aegean Sea during 396 to 395 BC, and against Cyprus in the 380s BC.

During the 390s BC, Camisares was appointed as satrap of Cilicia. Camisares was himself succeeded by his son, Datames, who eventually became the satrap of both Cilicia and Cappadocia until his assassination in .

In the 340s BC, the satrap of Cilicia was Mazaeus, who was also given authority over Syria as reward for his service in a campaign against Egypt.

=== Hellenistic period ===
Alexander forded the Halys River in the summer of 333 BC, ending up on the border of southeastern Phrygia and Cilicia. He knew well the writings of Xenophon, and how the Cilician Gates had been &quot;impassable if obstructed by the enemy&quot;. Alexander reasoned that by force alone he could frighten the defenders and break through, and he gathered his men to do so. In the cover of night, they attacked, startling the guards and sending them and their satrap into full flight, setting their crops aflame as they made for Tarsus. This good fortune allowed Alexander and his army to pass unharmed through the Gates and into Cilicia.

During Alexander III&#x27;s invasion, a lesser officer named Arsames who had fled to Cilicia from the northwest to organise new resistance there defended it against the Macedonian forces.

After Alexander&#x27;s death it was long a battleground of the rival Hellenistic monarchs and kingdoms, and for a time fell under Ptolemaic dominion (i.e., Egypt), but finally came to the Seleucids, who, however, never held effectually more than the eastern half.

Although no later Persian empire ever regained control of Cilicia, one Seleucid officer named Aribazus and attested as administrator of Cilicia in 246 BC was possibly of Persian descent.

During the Hellenistic era, numerous cities were established in Cilicia, which minted coins showing the badges (gods, animals, and objects) associated with each polis.

=== Roman and Byzantine periods ===

Cilicia Trachea became the haunt of pirates, who were subdued by Pompey in 67 BC following a Battle of Korakesion (modern Alanya), and Tarsus was made the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia. Cilicia Pedias became Roman territory in 103 BC first conquered by Marcus Antonius Orator in his campaign against pirates, with Sulla acting as its first governor, foiling an invasion of Mithridates, and the whole was organized by Pompey, 64 BC, into a province which, for a short time, extended to and included part of Phrygia.
In 51 BC, the Parthian Empire was able to take advantage of the weakness of the Roman Republic to invade Cilicia ().

It was reorganized by Julius Caesar, 47 BC, and about 27 BC became part of the province Syria-Cilicia Phoenice. At first, the western district was left independent under native kings or priest-dynasts, and a small kingdom, under Tarcondimotus I, was left in the east; but these were finally united to the province by Vespasian, AD 72. Containing 47 known cities, it had been deemed important enough to be governed by a proconsul.

In 259 or 250, the Persian Sasanian king of kings Shapur I defeated the Roman Emperor Valerian, whose army included Cilician soldiers. After Valerian&#x27;s defeat, the Sasanian forces burnt and sacked several cities in Syria, Cilicia () and Cappadocia.

Under Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s Tetrarchy (c. 297), Cilicia was governed by a &quot;consularis&quot;; with Isauria and the Syrian, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Libyan provinces, formed the Diocesis Orientis (in the late 4th century the African component was split off as Diocese of Egypt), part of the pretorian prefecture also called &quot;Oriens&quot; (&#x27;the East&#x27;, also including the dioceses of Asiana and Pontica, both in Anatolia, and Thraciae in the Balkans), the rich bulk of the eastern Roman Empire. After the division of the Roman Empire, Cilicia became part of the eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire. Cilicia was one of the most important regions of the classical world and can be considered as the birthplace of Christianity.

Roman Cilicia exported the goats-hair cloth, &quot;Cilicium&quot;, which was used to make tents. Tarsus was also the birthplace of the early Christian missionary and author St. Paul, likely writer of 13 of the 27 books included in the New Testament.

Cilicia had numerous Christian communities and is mentioned six times in the Book of Acts and once in the Epistle to the Galatians (1:21). After Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, Cilicia was included in the territories of the patriarchate of Antioch. The region was divided into two civil and ecclesiastical provinces: &quot;Cilicia Prima&quot;, with a metropolitan diocese at Tarsus and suffragan dioceses for Pompeiopolis, Sebaste, , Corycus, Adana, Mallus and Zephyrium; and &quot;Cilicia Secunda&quot;, with a metropolitan diocese at Anazarbus and suffragan dioceses for Mopsuestia, Aegae, Epiphania, Irenopolis, Flavias, Castabala, Alexandria, Citidiopolis and Rhosus. Bishops from the various dioceses of Cilicia were well represented at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils.

After the division of the Roman Empire, Cilicia became part of the eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire.

=== Early Islamic period ===
In the 7th century Cilicia was invaded by the Muslim Arabs. The area was for some time an embattled no-man&#x27;s land. The Arabs succeeded in conquering the area in the early 8th century. Under the Abbasid Caliphate, Cilicia was resettled and transformed into a fortified frontier zone (&quot;thughur&quot;). Tarsus, re-built in 787/788, quickly became the largest settlement in the region and the Arabs&#x27; most important base in their raids across the Taurus Mountains into Byzantine-held Anatolia.

The Muslims held the country until it was reoccupied by the Emperor Nicephorus II in 965. From this period onward, the area increasingly came to be settled by Armenians, especially as Imperial rule pushed deeper into the Caucasus over the course of the 11th century.

In medieval Arabic Cilicia was known as &quot;Ath-Thugur As-Shamiyya&quot; meaning &quot;Levantine outskirts&quot;.

=== Armenian Cilicia and the Crusades ===


During the time of the First Crusade, the area was controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The Seljuk Turkish invasions of Armenia were followed by an exodus of Armenians migrating westward into the Byzantine Empire, and in 1080 Ruben, a relative of the last king of Ani, founded in the heart of the Cilician Taurus a small principality which gradually expanded into the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. This Christian state, surrounded by Muslim states hostile to its existence, had a stormy history of about 300 years, giving valuable support to the Crusaders, and trading with the great commercial cities of Italy.

It prospered for three centuries due to the vast network of fortifications which secured all the major roads as well as the three principal harbours at Ayas, Koŕikos, and Mopsuestia. Through their complex alliances with the Crusader states, the Armenian barons and kings often invited Crusaders to maintain castles in and along the borders of the Kingdom, including Bagras, Trapessac, T‛il Hamtun, Harunia, Selefkia, Amouda, and Sarvandikar.

Gosdantin (r. 1095 – c. 1100) assisted the Crusaders on their march to Antioch, and was created knight and marquis. Thoros I (r. c. 1100 – 1129), in alliance with the Christian princes of Syria, waged successful wars against the Byzantines and Seljuk Turks. Levon II (Leo the Great (r. 1187–1219)), extended the kingdom beyond Mount Taurus and established the capital at Sis. He assisted the Crusaders, was crowned King by the Archbishop of Mainz, and married one of the Lusignans of the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus.

==== Mongols ====
Hetoum I (r. 1226–1270) made an alliance with the Mongols, sending his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in person. The Mongols then assisted with the defence of Cilicia from the Mamluks of Egypt, until the Mongols themselves converted to Islam.

==== Turkmens ====
The Ilkhanate lost cohesion after the death of Abu Sa&#x27;id (r. 1316–1335), and thus could not support the Armenian Kingdom in guarding Cilicia. Internal conflicts within the Armenian Kingdom and the devastation caused by the Black Death that arrived in 1348, led nomadic Türkmens to turn their eyes towards unstable Cilicia. In 1352, Ramazan Beg led Turkmens settled south of Çaldağı and founded their first settlement, Camili. Later that year, Ramazan Beg visited Cairo and was licensed by the Sultan to establish the new frontier &quot;Turkmen Emirate&quot; in Cilicia.

Yüreğir Türkmens lived as a small community for 7 years in southeast of Adana, and named their new land, Yüreğir.

==== Collapse ====
When Levon V died (1342), John of Lusignan was crowned king as Gosdantin IV; but he and his successors alienated the native Armenians by attempting to make them conform to the Roman Church, and by giving all posts of honour to Latins, until at last the kingdom, falling prey to internal dissensions, ceded Cilicia Pedias to the Ramadanid-supported Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt in 1375.

=== Mamluk and Turkmen rule ===
In 1359, Mamluk Sultanate Army marched into Cilicia and took over Adana and Tarsus, two major cities of the plain, leaving few castles to Armenians. In 1375, Mamluks gained the control of the remaining areas of Cilicia, thus ending the three centuries rule of Armenians. Cilicia Pedias became part of the Mamluk Sultanate in 1375. Mamluk Sultanate authorized Ramazan Beg led Türkmen Emirate to administer Cilicia, but took direct control of the towns, Tarsus, Ayas, Sarvandikar, Sis at the four corners of Cilicia plain and appointed an Amir and a Garrison for each. Tarsus, the former capital of Cilicia, were settled by the moors that arrived from Egypt. Türkmen Emirate which began to be known as Ramadanids, set the city of Adana as their center of power, and many Türkmen families of Yüreğir origin moved to the city.

After the death of Ramazan Bey, his son Ibrahim Bey made alliance with the Karaman Emirate. Alaeddin Bey and Ibrahim Bey together tried to break the Mameluks&#x27; might in the province. After this alliance a great Mameluk army moved in and began to plunder but Ibrahim Bey&#x27;s army achieved a great victory against the Mameluks in Belen. Also in this battle Temur Bey, the general of the Mameluks, had been captured. Yilboga, the amir of Aleppo moved on to the Turkmens after this defeat and he conquered Misis Castle.

Ramadanids were the only emirate in Anatolia that were not a successor of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate. They are often misclassified as an Anatolian beylik, though they were an entity under Mamluks. The Ramadanids played an important role in 15th century Ottoman-Mamluk relations, being a buffer state located in the Mamluk &quot;al-&#x27;Awasim&quot; frontier zone. Cilicia were one of the last regions of Anatolia to fall under Turkish rule, and were part of the Seljuqs for a short time, thus were not effected from Sunni tariqa expansionism of the 13th century. Yüreğir Turks moved to Cilicia in the late 14th century, and had a distinct culture that influenced from Bektashi traditions which accompanied Shamanic rituals with Islam. Living together and having cultural exchange with the large Armenian community, Yüreğir Turks flourished a laid back culture.

The Karamanid Principality, one of the Turkmen Anatolian beyliks emerged after the collapse of the Anatolian Seljuks, took over the rule of Cilicia Thracea.

=== Ottoman period ===
In 1516, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608, with the area serving as a vassal of the Ottomans.
Ottomans ended the Ramadanid administration of Adana sanjak in 1608, ruling it directly from Constantinople then after. The autonomous sanjak was then split from the Aleppo Eyalet and established as a new province under the name of Adana Eyalet. A governor was appointed to administer the province. In late 1832, Eyalet of Egypt Vali Muhammad Ali Pasha invaded Syria, and reached Cilicia. The Convention of Kütahya that was signed on 14 May 1833, ceded Cilicia to the &quot;de facto&quot; independent Egypt.

Alawites brought to Cilicia from Syria to work at the flourishing agricultural lands. İbrahim Paşa, the son of Muhammed Ali Paşa, demolished the Adana Castle and the city walls in 1836. He built the canals for irrigation and transportation and also built water systems for the residential areas of the towns. Adana had the infrastructure it needed by the second half of the 19th century to become major center of Southeastern Anatolia.

After the Oriental crisis, the Convention of Alexandria that was signed on 27 November 1840, required the return of Cilicia to Ottoman sovereignty. The American Civil War that broke out in 1861 disturbed the cotton flow to Europe and directed European cotton traders to fertile Cilicia. The region became the centre of cotton trade and one of the most economically strong regions of the Empire within decades. In 1869, Adana Eyalet was re-established as Adana Vilayet, after the re-structuring in the Ottoman Administration. Adana–Mersin railway line was opened in 1886, connecting Cilicia to international ports through Port of Mersin.

A thriving regional economy, the doubling of Cilician Armenian population due to flee from the Hamidian massacres, and the end of autocratic Abdulhamid rule with the revolution of 1908, empowered the Armenian community and envisioned an autonomous Cilicia. Enraged supporters of Abdulhamid that organized under Cemiyet-i Muhammediye amidst the countercoup, led to a series of anti-Armenian pogroms in 14–27 April 1909. The Adana massacre resulted in the deaths of roughly 25,000 Armenians, orphaned 3500 children and caused heavy destruction of Christian neighbourhoods in the entire Vilayet.

The Cilicia section of the Berlin–Baghdad railway was opened in 1912, connecting the region to the Middle East. Over the course of the Armenian genocide, an Ottoman telegraph was received by the Governor to deport the more than 70,000 Armenians of the Adana Vilayet to Syria. Armenians of Zeitun had organized a successful resistance against the Ottoman onslaught. In order to finally subjugate Zeitun, the Ottomans had to resort to treachery by forcing an Armenian delegation from Marash to ask the &quot;Zeituntsi&quot;s to put down their arms. Both the Armenian delegation, and later, the inhabitants of Zeitun, were left with no choice.

=== Modern era ===
Armistice of Mudros that was signed on 30 October 1918 to end the World War I, ceded the control of Cilicia to France. French Government sent four battalions of the Armenian Legion in December to take over and oversee the repatriation of more than 170,000 Armenians to Cilicia. Returning Armenians negotiated with France to establish an autonomous &quot;State of Cilicia&quot;. The Armenians formed the Armenian National Union which acted as an unofficial Cilician Armenian government composed of the four major political parties and three Armenian religious denominations. Mihran Damadian, the chief negotiator for Armenians, signed the provisional &quot;Constitution of Cilicia&quot; in 1919 to bring new order to the region.

On 4 May 1920, Armenian people declared the independence of Cilicia under the French mandate.

The French forces were spread too thinly in the region and, as they came under withering attacks by Muslim elements both opposed and loyal to Mustafa Kemal Pasha, eventually reversed their policies in the region. A truce arranged on 28 May between the French and the Kemalists, led to the retreat of the French forces south of the Mersin-Osmaniye railroad.

With the changing political environment and interests, the French further reversed their policy: The repatriation was halted, and the French ultimately abandoned all pretensions to Cilicia, which they had originally hoped to attach to their mandate over Syria. Cilicia Peace Treaty was signed on 9 March 1921 between France and Turkish Grand National Assembly. The treaty did not achieve the intended goals and was replaced with the Treaty of Ankara that was signed on 20 October 1921. Based on the terms of the agreement, France recognized the end of the Cilicia War, and French troops together with the remaining Armenian volunteers withdrew from the region in early January 1922.

Maronite community were re-settled in Lebanon by the French Administration. Later in 1922, roughly 10,000 Greeks were erforced to move to Greece by the policy of Greco-Turkish population exchange. Cilicia Armenians settled in Lebanon, at the newly founded Armenian Bourj Hammoud town, just north-east of Beirut. From 1920s, around 60 percent of the Cilician Armenians moved to Argentina. An informal census of 1941 revealed that, 70 percent of all the Armenian Argentines in Buenos Aires had Adana origins.

=== Republic of Turkey ===
The region become part of the Republic of Turkey in 1921 with the signing of the Treaty of Ankara. On 15 April 1923, just before the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, the Turkish government enacted the &quot;Law of Abandoned Properties&quot; which confiscated properties of Armenians and Greeks who were not present on their property. Cilicia were one of the regions with the most confiscated property, thus muhacirs (en: immigrants) from Balkans and Crete were relocated in the old Armenian and Greek neighbourhoods and villages of the region. All types of properties, lands, houses and workshops were distributed to them. Also during this period, there was a property rush of Muslims from Kayseri and Darende to Cilicia who were granted the ownership of large farms, factories, stores and mansions. Within a decade, Cilicia had a sharp change demographically, socially and economically and lost its diversity by turning into solely Muslim/Turkish.

Remaining Jews and Christians were hit by the heavy burden of the Wealth Tax in 1942, which caused them to leave Cilicia, selling their properties for peanuts to families like Sabancı, who built their wealth on owning confiscated or cheaply purchased properties. Forcible change in means of production led to abuse of wealth and harsh treatment of labor later in the 20th century, as the new possessors did not have the necessary management attributes that the previous owners had for centuries.

=== Legacy ===
Ancient Cilicia features in Greek mythology as a place whose name is derived from a people named the () who lived in the Troad. The Hittitologist Trevor Bryce considers it plausible that populations from the Troad might have migrated to the southeast into the region which later became Cilicia during the drastic changes which formed part of the Late Bronze Age collapse at the end of the 2nd millennium BC.

The Greeks invented for Cilicia an eponymous Hellene founder in the purely mythical Cilix, but the historic founder of the dynasty that ruled &quot;Cilicia Pedias&quot; was Mopsus, identifiable in Phoenician sources as &quot;Mpš&quot;, the founder of Mopsuestia who gave his name to an oracle nearby. Homer mentions the people of Mopsus, identified as &quot;Cilices&quot; (Κίλικες), as from the Troad in the northwestern-most part of Anatolia.

== Society and culture ==
=== Ancient ===
==== Ethnicity ====
The inhabitants of Ancient Cilicia were Luwians who had settled in this region in the 2nd millennium BC, and Cilicia itself had become an important centre of Luwian settlement in Anatolia in the aftermath of the Late Bronze Age collapse.

This Luwian population persisted in Cilicia in the 1st millennium BC until the later Hellenistic and Roman periods, hence why the onomastics of this region, especially in its western part (Rough Cilicia), were Luwian in character, implying that it was inhabited by a large number of Luwian speakers until the early 1st millennium AD.

===== Persian influence =====
Like in the rest of the western satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire, Persians had moved in Cilicia, and archaeological evidence such as reliefs from Silifke, Adana and Korykos suggest that a Persian nobility as well as a Persianised nobility existed in Cilicia during the Achaemenid period.

===== Cultural diversity =====
Achaemenid and post-Achaemenid Cilicia was culturally very diverse, as attested by:
* Aramaic funerary inscriptions and an Aramaic foundation text at Meydancık;
* coins minted at Soli and Tarsus of Persian, modified Persian, and non-Persian types;
* Greek and Aramaic inscriptions.

==== Social organisation ====
The population of the eastern part of ancient Cilicia was urbanised and participated in commercial and industrial activities, while the inhabitants of its western regions were tribally organised and led simpler lifestyles.

=== Modern ===
Significant Christian communities (Antiochian Greek Christians and Armenians) found in Adana, İskenderun, and Mersin.

=== Administrative structure ===
==== Ancient ====
The rulers of the kingdom of Cilicia styled themselves using the title of (), itself derived from the name of their founding king Syennesis I, which was derived from Luwian , which was itself the genitival adjective of the term , meaning .

Temple estates had existed in Cilicia since the pre-Achaemenid period, although the best documentation regarding them is from the Hellenestic period. Known temple esates include the temple of Zeus at Olbē and the temple of Artemis Perasia at Kastabala.

==== Achaemenid ====
Like the other western satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire, the satrap of Cilicia owned an estate with a palace at Tarsus, which was a large and thriving city during the Achaemenid period. Subordinate to the satrap in the local administration were lower rank officials, with some of them being landed aristocrats owning estates and villages, and others being priests in the sanctuaries of Cilicia who administered the temple estates, as well as other even lesser officials.

The temple estates persisted through the Achaemenid period, implying that their existence was not perceived as detrimental to the authority of the satrap of Cilicia.

The duties of the satrap including maintaining peace within his satrapy to ensure agriculture could be conducted and tribute could be produced, as well as to keep the locations at higher altitudes and the mountain passes under control loyal to the Achaemenid crown, to which it contributed 360 horses and 140 talents of silver for defence.

Cilicia also provided troops to the land and maritime military forces of the Achaemenid Empire, and the satrapy itself acted as an assembly point for them.

Little is known of the large cities in the Achaemenid period, although Tarsus and Soli are known to have minted coins which were used in the Achaemenid military campaigns against Cyprus and Egypt.

During the Achaemenid period, the administration of Cilicia was stable and efficient, thanks to which it was agriculturally very productive and was capable of holding large military concentrations. The fact that the king of kings Darius I expected 500 talents of silver as tribute from Cilicia attests that its administration was of the necessary competence to generate a revenue that was more than trivial.

==== Hellenistic ====
In the Hellenistic period, the Cilician temple estates adopted Greek culture under the influence of Seleucid administration:
* the high priests of Zeus at Olbe were able to expand their authority after the fall of the Achaemend Empire, and they became culturally Hellenised, with their dynasts shifting their names from Tarkuaris (, from Luwian ) to Teukros ();
* the chief priest of the temple of Artemis Perasia at Castabala was also a dynast who became culturally Hellenised.

==== Modern ====
Modern Cilicia is split into four administrative provinces: Mersin, Adana, Osmaniye and Hatay. Each province is governed by the Central Government in Ankara through an appointed Provincial governor. Provinces are then divided into districts governed by the District Governors who are under the provincial governors.

=== Religion ===
==== Ancient ====
Reflecting the diversity of Cilicia in the Achaemenid and post-Achaemenid periods, various deities of different origins have been attested there in antiquity:
* an Aramaic funerary inscription from Kesecek Köyü to the north-east of Tarsus was accompanied by depictions of Semitic deities;
* one Cilician coin depicted Baal of Tarsus with an Achaemenid winged disk;
* another Cilician coin depicted the Semitic god Nergal wearing Persian clothes, possibly resulting from an identification of him with Mithra.

As a result of the strong impact of 200 years of rule by the Persian Achaemenid Empire, fire altars and magi were still present at Tarsus and in the rest of Cilicia in the , as recorded by the Sasanian high priest Kartir.

== Demographics ==
Cilicia is heavily populated due to its abundant resources, climate and plain geography. The population of Cilicia as of 31 December 2022 is 6,435,986.

Hatay is the most rural province of Cilicia and also Hatay is the only province that the rural population is rising and the urban population is declining. The major reason is the mountainous geography of Hatay.

Adana Province is the most urbanized province, with most of the population centred in the city of Adana. Mersin Province has a larger rural population than Adana Province, owing to its long and narrow stretch of flat land in between the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean.

== Economy ==
Cilicia is well known for the vast fertile land and highly productive agriculture. The region is also industrialized; Tarsus, Adana and Ceyhan host numerous plants. Mersin and İskenderun seaports provide transportation of goods manufactured in Central, South and Southeast Anatolia. Ceyhan hosts oil, natural gas terminals as well as refineries and shipbuilders.

=== Natural resources ===
==== Agriculture ====
The Cilicia plain has some of the most fertile soil in the world in which 3 harvests can be taken each year. The region has the second richest flora in the world and it is the producer of all agricultural products of Turkey except hazelnut and tobacco. Cilicia leads Turkey in soy, peanuts and corn harvest and is a major producer of fruits and vegetables. Half of Turkey&#x27;s citrus export is from Cilicia. Anamur is the only sub-tropical area of Turkey where bananas, mango, kiwi and other sub-tropical produce can be harvested.

Cilicia is the second largest honey producer in Turkey after the Muğla–Aydın region. Samandağ, Yumurtalık, Karataş and Bozyazı are some of the towns in the region where fishing is the major source of income. Gray mullet, red mullet, sea bass, lagos, calamari and gilt-head bream are some of the most popular fish in the region. There are aquaculture farms in Akyatan, Akyağan, Yumurtalık lakes and at Seyhan Reservoir. While not as common as other forms of agriculture, dairy and livestock are also produced throughout the region.

==== Mining ====
* Zinc and lead: Kozan-Horzum seam is the major source.
* Chrome is found around Aladağlar.
* Baryte resources are around Mersin and Adana.
* Iron is found around Feke and Saimbeyli.
* Asbestos mines are mostly in Hatay Province.
* Limestone reserves are very rich in Cilicia. The region is home to four lime manufacturing plants.
* Pumice resources are the richest in Turkey. 14% of country&#x27;s reserves are in Cilicia.

=== Manufacturing ===
Cilicia is one of the first industrialized regions of Turkey. With the improvements in agriculture and the spike of agricultural yield, agriculture-based industries are built in large numbers. Today, the manufacturing industry is mainly concentrated around Tarsus, Adana and Ceyhan. Textile, leather tanning and food processing plants are plentiful. İsdemir is a large steel plant located in İskenderun.

The petrochemical industry is rapidly developing in the region with the investments around the Ceyhan Oil Terminal. Petroleum refineries are being built in the area. Ceyhan is also expected to host the shipbuilding industry.

=== Commerce ===
Adana is the commercial centre of the region where many of the public and private institutions have their regional offices. Mersin and Antakya are also home to regional offices of public institutions. Many industry fairs and congresses are held in the region at venues such as the TÜYAP Congress and Exhibition Centre in Adana and the Mersin Congress Centre.

Mersin Seaport is the third largest seaport in Turkey, after Istanbul and İzmir. There are 45 piers in the port. The total area of the port is , and the capacity is 6,000 ships per year.

İskenderun Seaport is used mostly for transfers to Middle East and Southeastern Turkey.

Ceyhan Oil Terminal is a marine transport terminal for the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (the &quot;BTC&quot;), the Kirkuk–Ceyhan Oil Pipeline, the planned Samsun-Ceyhan and the Ceyhan-Red Sea pipelines. Ceyhan will also be a natural gas terminal for a planned pipeline to be constructed parallel to the Kirkuk-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and for a planned extension of the Blue Stream Gas Pipeline from Samsun to Ceyhan.

Dörtyol Oil Terminal is a marine transport terminal for Batman-Dörtyol oil pipeline which started operating in 1967 to market Batman oil. The pipeline is 511 km long and has an annual capacity of 3.5 million tons.

=== Tourism ===
While the region has a long coastline, international tourism is not at the level of the neighbouring Antalya Province. There are a small number of hotels between Erdemli and Anamur that attracts tourists. Cilicia tourism is mostly cottage tourism serving the Cilicia locals as well as residents of Kayseri, Gaziantep and surrounding areas. Between Silifke and Mersin, high-rise and low-rise cottages line the coast, leaving almost no vacant land. The coastline from Mersin to Karataş is mostly farmland. This area is zoned for resort tourism and is expected to have a rapid development within the next 20 years. Karataş and Yumurtalık coasts are home to cottages with a bird conservatory between the two areas. Arsuz is a seaside resort that is mostly frequented by Antakya and İskenderun residents.

Plateaus on the Taurus mountains are cooler escapes for the locals who wants to chill out from hot and humid summers of the lower plains. Gözne and Çamlıyayla (Namrun) in Mersin Province, Tekir, Bürücek and Kızıldağ in Adana Province, Zorkun in Osmaniye Province and Soğukoluk in Hatay Province are the popular high plain resorts of Cilicia which are often crowded in summer. There are a few hotels and camping sites in the Tekir plateau.

==== Balneary tourism ====
The region is a popular destination for thermal springs. Hamamat Thermal Spring, located on midway from Kırıkhan to Reyhanlı, has a very high sulphur ratio, making it the second in the world after a thermal spring in India. It is the largest spa in the region and attracts many Syrians due to proximity. Haruniye Thermal Spring is located on the banks of the Ceyhan River near Düziçi town and has a serene environment. Thermal springs are a hot spot for people with rheumatism. Kurttepe, Alihocalı and Ilıca mineral springs, all located in Adana Province, are popular for toxic cleansing. Ottoman Palace Thermal Resort &amp; Spa in Antakya is one of Turkey&#x27;s top resorts for revitalization.

==== Religious tourism ====
Lying at a crossroads of three major religions, namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the region is home to numerous landmarks that are important for people of faith. Tarsus is the birthplace of Paul the Apostle, who returned to the city after his conversion. The city was a stronghold of Christians after his death. Ashab-ı Kehf cavern, one of the locations claimed to be the resting place of the legendary Seven Sleepers, holy to Christians and Muslims, is located north of Tarsus.

Antakya is another destination for the spiritual world, where, according to the New Testament the followers of Jesus Christ were first called Christians. the Church of Saint Peter near Antakya (Antioch) is one of Christianity&#x27;s oldest churches. It is the home of Saint Peter, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus. Antioch was called &quot;the cradle of Christianity&quot; as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity,

== Society ==
Cilicia was one of the most important regions for the Ottoman Armenians because it managed very well to preserve Armenian character throughout the years. In fact, the Cilician highlands were densely populated by Armenians in small but prosperous towns and villages such as Hadjin and Zeitun, two mountainous areas where autonomy was maintained until the 19th century. In ports and cities of the Adana plain, commerce and industry were almost entirely in the hands of the Armenians and they remained so thanks to a constant influx of Armenians from the highlands. Their population was continuously increasing in numbers in Cilicia in contrast to other parts of the Ottoman Empire, where it was, since 1878, decreasing due to repression.

== Mythological namesake ==
Greek mythology mentions another Cilicia, as a small region situated immediately southeast of the Troad in northwestern Anatolia, facing the Gulf of Adramyttium. The connection (if any) between this Cilicia and the better-known and well-defined region mentioned above is unclear. This Trojan Cilicia is mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, and contained localities such as Thebe, Lyrnessus and Chryse (home to Chryses and Chryseis). These three cities were all attacked and sacked by Achilles during the Trojan War.

In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (v 353), Aeschylus mentions the Cilician caves (probably Cennet and Cehennem), where the earth-born, hundred-headed monster Typhon dwelt before he withstood the gods and was stricken and charred by Zeus&#x27;s thunderbolt.

<text>The Tumucumaque Mountains National Park (; ) is situated in the Amazon Rainforest in the Brazilian states of Amapá and Pará. It is bordered to the north by French Guiana and Suriname.

== History ==
Tumucumaque was declared a national park on August 23, 2002, by the Government of Brazil, after collaboration with the WWF. 
It is part of the Amapá Biodiversity Corridor, created in 2003.
The conservation unit is supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Its Management Plan was published on March 10, 2010.

== Geography ==
Tumucumaque Mountains National Park has an area of more than , making it the world&#x27;s largest tropical forest national park and larger than Belgium. This area even reaches when including the bordering Guiana Amazonian Park, a national park in French Guiana. 
This combination of protected areas is still smaller than the three national parks system in the Brazil-Venezuelan border, where the Parima-Tapirapeco, Serranía de la Neblina and Pico da Neblina national parks have a combined area of over .

But the latter is certainly smaller if the Tumucumaque Mountains National Park (Brazil) and the adjacent Guiana Amazonian Park (France) is combined with large neighbouring protected areas in northern Pará, Brazil, such as Grão-Pará Ecological Station, Maicuru Biological Reserve, and many others. The importance is that this makes the Guiana Shield one of the best protected and largest ecological corridor of tropical rainforests in the world. It is an &quot;uninhabited&quot; region and is of high ecological value: most of its animal species, mainly fish and aquatic birds, are not found in any other place in the world. 
It is a habitat for jaguars, primates, aquatic turtles, and harpy eagles.

The highest point of the Brazilian state of Amapá is located there, reaching 701 meters.

=== Climate ===
The climate is tropical monsoon (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;), common in areas of northern Brazil in transition from biomes to the Amazon Forest. It has an average temperature of 25 °C (77 °F) and accumulated rainfall ranging from 2,000 (78.84 in) to 3,250 mm (127.95 in) per year.
== Tourism ==
Tourism in the Park takes place in two different sectors: Amapari Sector and Oiapoque Sector.

At Amaparí Sector, the Park is accessed by Serra do Navio city (most common) or by a community in Pedra Branca do Amapari (usually in the summer). The trip is made by the Amapari River, using aluminum boats (90 km from Serra do Navio) to the park&#x27;s rustic base, where it is possible to stay in a camping structure adapted to Amazonian conditions (hammocks) and do activities such as trails, bathing in rivers and animal and plants watching.

At Oiapoque Sector, you can camp at Cachoeira do Anotaie, which is located on the Anotaie River, a tributary of the Oiapoque River. This waterfall is 40 km from the city of Oiapoque, on a trip using aluminum boats. There is also the possibility to visit Vila Brasil, a community located on the right bank of the Oiapoque River and located in front of the French-Guyanese indigenous community of Camopi. In this location there are small hotels and it is possible to understand its socio-cultural context, where the residents, mostly traders, provide services to the indigenous people of the neighboring country.

<doc id="75469" wikidata="Q7257" url="?curid=75469" title="Ideology">
<text>An ideology is a set of beliefs or values attributed to a person or group of persons, especially those held for reasons that are not purely about belief in certain knowledge, in which &quot;practical elements are as prominent as theoretical ones&quot;. Formerly applied primarily to economic, political, or religious theories and policies, in a tradition going back to Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, more recent use treats the term as mainly condemnatory.

The term was coined by Antoine Destutt de Tracy, a French Enlightenment aristocrat and philosopher, who conceived it in 1796 as the &quot;science of ideas&quot; to develop a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational impulses of the mob. In political science, the term is used in a descriptive sense to refer to political belief systems.

== Etymology ==

The term &quot;ideology&quot; originates from French , itself coined from combining (; close to the Lockean sense of &quot;idea&quot;) and &quot;-logíā&quot; ().

== History ==
The term &quot;ideology&quot; and the system of ideas associated with it were developed in 1796 by Antoine Destutt de Tracy (1754-1836), who crystallised his ideas while in prison (November 1793 to October 1794) pending trial during the Reign of Terror of to July 1794. While imprisoned he read the works of Locke and Étienne Bonnot de Condillac.

Hoping to form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences, Tracy devised the term for a &quot;science of ideas&quot;, basing such upon two things: (1) the sensations that people experience as they interact with the material world; and (2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. Tracy conceived of &quot;ideology&quot; as a liberal philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property, free markets, and constitutional limits on state power. He argues that, among these aspects, ideology is the most generic term because the &#x27;science of ideas&#x27; also contains the study of their expression and deduction. The coup d&#x27;état that overthrew Maximilien Robespierre in July 1794 allowed Tracy to pursue his work. Tracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution (during the Napoleonic regime of 1799 to 1815 as part of the Napoleonic Wars) by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob-impulses that had nearly destroyed him.

A subsequent early source for the near-original meaning of &quot;ideology&quot; is Hippolyte Taine&#x27;s work on the Ancien Régime, &quot;Origins of Contemporary France&quot; () volume I (1875). He describes &quot;ideology&quot; as rather like teaching philosophy via the Socratic method, though without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Tracy but also with his milieu, and includes Condillac as one of its precursors.

Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) came to view &quot;ideology&quot; as a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy&#x27;s &quot;Institut national&quot;. According to Karl Mannheim&#x27;s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of &quot;ideology&quot;, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as &quot;the ideologues&quot;. Tracy&#x27;s major book, &quot;The Elements of Ideology&quot; (, published 1804-1815), was soon translated into major European languages.

In the century following Tracy&#x27;s formulations, the term &quot;ideology&quot; moved back and forth between positive and negative connotations. When post-Napoleonic governments adopted a reactionary stance, the concept influenced the Italian, Spanish and Russian thinkers who had begun to describe themselves as &quot;liberals&quot; and who attempted to reignite revolutionary activity in the early 1820s, including the Carbonari societies in France and Italy and the Decembrists in Russia. Karl Marx (1818-1883) adopted Napoleon&#x27;s negative sense of the term, using it in his writings, in which he once described Tracy as a (a &quot;fish-blooded bourgeois doctrinaire&quot;). The term has since dropped some of its pejorative sting (euphemism treadmill), and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups. While Marx situated the term within class struggle and domination, others believed it was a necessary part of institutional functioning and social integration.

In parallel with post-Soviet Russian ideas about the mono-ideologies of (for example) monotheism, Walter Brueggemann (1933- ) has examined &quot;ideological extension&quot; in historical religious/political contexts.

==Definitions and analysis==
There are many different kinds of ideologies, including political, social, epistemological, and ethical. Recent analysis tends to posit that &quot;ideology&quot; is a &#x27;coherent system of ideas&#x27; that rely on a few basic assumptions about reality that may or may not have any factual basis. Through this system, ideas become coherent, repeated patterns through the subjective ongoing choices that people make. These ideas serve as the seed around which further thought grows. The belief in an ideology can range from passive acceptance up to fervent advocacy. Definitions, such as by Manfred Steger and Paul James, emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth. They wrote: &quot;Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations. These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth.&quot;

Studies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of &quot;systematic ideology&quot; in the works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, who attempt to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems. David W. Minar describes six different ways the word &quot;ideology&quot; has been used:
# As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of &quot;content&quot;, usually normative;
# As the &quot;form or internal logical structure&quot; that ideas have within a set;
# By the role ideas play in &quot;human-social interaction&quot;;
# By the role ideas play in the &quot;structure of an organization&quot;;
# As meaning, whose purpose is &quot;persuasion&quot;; and
# As the &quot;locus&quot; of social interaction.

For Willard A. Mullins, an &quot;ideology&quot; should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of &quot;utopia&quot; and &quot;historical myth&quot;. An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:
# it must have power over cognition;
# it must be capable of guiding one&#x27;s evaluations;
# it must provide guidance towards action; and
# it must be logically coherent.

Terry Eagleton outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:
# The process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life
# A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class
# Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power
# Systematically distorted communication
# Ideas that offer a position for a subject
# Forms of thought motivated by social interests
# Identity thinking
# Socially necessary illusion
# The conjuncture of discourse and power
# The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world
# Action-oriented sets of beliefs
# The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality
# Semiotic closure
# The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure
# The process that converts social life to a natural reality

German philosopher Christian Duncker called for a &quot;critical reflection of the ideology concept&quot;. In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of epistemology and history, defining &quot;ideology&quot; in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly lay claim to absolute truth.

===Marxist interpretation===

Marx&#x27;s analysis sees ideology as a system of false consciousness that arises from the economic relationships, reflecting and perpetuating the interests of the dominant class.

In the Marxist base and superstructure model of society, &quot;base&quot; denotes the relations of production and modes of production, and &quot;superstructure&quot; denotes the dominant ideology (i.e. religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology—actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a feudal mode of production, religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as liberalism and social democracy dominate. Hence the great importance of ideology justifies a society and politically confuses the alienated groups of society via false consciousness. Some explanations have been presented. Antonio Gramsci uses cultural hegemony to explain why the working-class have a false ideological conception of what their best interests are. Marx argued: &quot;The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production.&quot;

The Marxist formulation of &quot;ideology as an instrument of social reproduction&quot; is conceptually important to the sociology of knowledge, viz. Karl Mannheim, Daniel Bell, and Jürgen Habermas et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed and progressed from the &quot;total&quot; but &quot;special&quot; Marxist conception of ideology to a &quot;general&quot; and &quot;total&quot; ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including Marxism) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu. Slavoj Žižek and the earlier Frankfurt School added to the &quot;general theory&quot; of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious but also unconscious ideas.

=== Ideology and the commodity (Debord) ===
The French Marxist theorist Guy Debord, founding member of the Situationist International, argued that when the commodity becomes the &quot;essential category&quot; of society, i.e. when the process of commodification has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of exchange value), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, The Society of the Spectacle.

=== Unifying agents (Hoffer) ===
The American philosopher Eric Hoffer identified several elements that unify followers of a particular ideology:

# Hatred: &quot;Mass movements can rise and spread without a God, but never without belief in a devil.&quot; The &quot;ideal devil&quot; is a foreigner.
# Imitation: &quot;The less satisfaction we derive from being ourselves, the greater is our desire to be like others…the more we mistrust our judgment and luck, the more are we ready to follow the example of others.&quot;
# Persuasion: The proselytizing zeal of propagandists derives from &quot;a passionate search for something not yet found more than a desire to bestow something we already have.&quot;
# Coercion: Hoffer asserts that violence and fanaticism are interdependent. People forcibly converted to Islamic or communist beliefs become as fanatical as those who did the forcing. He says: &quot;It takes fanatical faith to rationalize our cowardice.&quot;
# Leadership: Without the leader, there is no movement. Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe. He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future. The skills required include: audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses; and a group of able lieutenants. Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, &quot;a single-minded fashioning after a model.&quot; He will not lead followers towards the &quot;promised land&quot;, but only &quot;away from their unwanted selves&quot;.
# Action: Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.
# Suspicion: &quot;There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched.&quot; This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.

===Ronald Inglehart===

Ronald Inglehart of the University of Michigan is author of the World Values Survey, which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.

==Political ideologies==

In political science, a political ideology is a certain ethical set of ideals, principles, doctrines, myths, or symbols of a social movement, institution, class, or large group that explains how society should work, offering some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including but not limited to: the economy, the government, the environment, education, health care, labor law, criminal law, the justice system, social security and welfare, public policy and administration, foreign policy, rights, freedoms and duties, citizenship, immigration, culture and national identity, military administration, and religion.

Political ideologies have two dimensions:
# Goals: how society should work; and
# Methods: the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement.
A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate power and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best form of government (e.g., democracy, demagogy, theocracy, caliphate etc.), scope of government (e.g. authoritarianism, libertarianism, federalism, etc.) and the best economic system (e.g. capitalism, socialism, etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, &quot;socialism&quot; may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system. Post 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age, in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed. This view is often associated with Francis Fukuyama&#x27;s writings on the &quot;end of history&quot;. Contrastly, Nienhueser (2011) sees research (in the field of human resource management) as ongoingly &quot;generating ideology&quot;.

There are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies. Ideologies can identify themselves by their position on the political spectrum (e.g. left, center, or right). They may also be distinguished by single issues around which they may be built (e.g. civil libertarianism, support or opposition to European integration, legalization of marijuana). They may also be distinguished by political strategies (e.g. populism, personalism). The classification of political ideology is difficult, however, due to cultural relativity in definitions. For example, &quot;what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism&quot;; a conservatism in Finland would be labeled socialism in the United States.

Philosopher Michael Oakeshott defines single-issue ideologies as &quot;the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition&quot;. Moreover, Charles Blattberg offers an account that distinguishes political &quot;ideologies&quot; from political &quot;philosophies&quot;.

Slavoj Žižek argues how the very notion of post-ideology can enable the deepest, blindest form of ideology. A sort of false consciousness or false cynicism, engaged in for the purpose of lending one&#x27;s point of view the respect of being objective, pretending neutral cynicism, without truly being so. Rather than help avoiding ideology, this lapse only deepens the commitment to an existing one. Zizek calls this &quot;a post-modernist trap&quot;. Peter Sloterdijk advanced the same idea already in 1988.

Studies have shown that political ideology is somewhat genetically heritable.

===Ideology and state===

When a political ideology becomes a dominantly pervasive component within a government, one can speak of an &quot;ideocracy&quot;. Different forms of government use ideology in various ways, not always restricted to politics and society. Certain ideas and schools of thought become favored, or rejected, over others, depending on their compatibility with or use for the reigning social order.

In &quot;The Anatomy of Revolution&quot;, Crane Brinton said that new ideology spreads when there is discontent with an old regime. The may be repeated during revolutions itself; extremists such as Vladimir Lenin and Robespierre may thus overcome more moderate revolutionaries. This stage is soon followed by Thermidor, a reining back of revolutionary enthusiasm under pragmatists like Napoleon and Joseph Stalin, who bring &quot;normalcy and equilibrium&quot;. Brinton&#x27;s sequence (&quot;men of ideas&gt;fanatics&gt;practical men of action&quot;) is reiterated by J. William Fulbright, while a similar form occurs in Eric Hoffer&#x27;s &quot;The True Believer&quot;.

==Epistemological ideologies==

Even when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant paradigm or mindset can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced. A special case of science that has inspired ideology is ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. Perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of self-awareness and cognition itself. Linguist George Lakoff has proposed a cognitive science of mathematics wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception—which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.

Deep ecology and the modern ecology movement (and, to a lesser degree, Green parties) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology. Some notable economically based ideologies include neoliberalism, monetarism, mercantilism, mixed economy, social Darwinism, communism, laissez-faire economics, and free trade. There are also current theories of safe trade and fair trade that can be seen as ideologies.

== Psychological explanations of ideology ==
A large amount of research in psychology is concerned with the causes, consequences and content of ideology, with humans being dubbed the &quot;ideological animal&quot; by Althusser. Many theories have tried to explain the existence of ideology in human societies.

Jost, Ledgerwood, and Hardin (2008) propose that ideologies may function as prepackaged units of interpretation that spread because of basic human motives to understand the world, avoid existential threat, and maintain valued interpersonal relationships. The authors conclude that such motives may lead disproportionately to the adoption of system-justifying worldviews. Psychologists generally agree that personality traits, individual difference variables, needs, and ideological beliefs seem to have something in common.

Just-world theory posits that people want to believe in a fair world for a sense of control and security and generate ideologies in order to maintain this belief, for example by justifiying inequality or unfortunate events. A critique of just world theory as a sole explanation of ideology is that it does not explain the differences between ideologies.

Terror management theory posits that ideology is used as a defence mechanism against threats to their worldview which in turn protect and individuals sense of self-esteem and reduce their awareness of mortality. Evidence shows that priming individuals with an awareness of mortality does not cause individuals to respond in ways underpinned by any particular ideology, but rather the ideology that they are currently aware of.

System justification theory posits that people tend to defend existing society, even at times against their interest, which in turn causes people to create ideological explanations to justify the status quo. Jost, Fitzimmons and Kay argue that the motivation to protect a preexisting system is due to a desire for cognitive consistency (being able to think in similar ways over time), reducing uncertainty and reducing effort, illusion of control and fear of equality. According to system justification theory, ideologies reflect (unconscious) motivational processes, as opposed to the view that political convictions always reflect independent and unbiased thinking.

== Ideology and the social sciences ==

=== Semiotic theory ===

According to semiotician Bob Hodge:[Ideology] identifies a unitary object that incorporates complex sets of meanings with the social agents and processes that produced them. No other term captures this object as well as &#x27;ideology&#x27;. Foucault&#x27;s &#x27;episteme&#x27; is too narrow and abstract, not social enough. His &#x27;discourse&#x27;, popular because it covers some of ideology&#x27;s terrain with less baggage, is too confined to verbal systems. &#x27;Worldview&#x27; is too metaphysical, &#x27;propaganda&#x27; too loaded. Despite or because of its contradictions, &#x27;ideology&#x27; still plays a key role in semiotics oriented to social, political life.Authors such as Michael Freeden have also recently incorporated a semantic analysis to the study of ideologies.

=== Sociology ===
Sociologists define &quot;ideology&quot; as &quot;cultural beliefs that justify particular social arrangements, including patterns of inequality&quot;. Dominant groups use these sets of cultural beliefs and practices to justify the systems of inequality that maintain their group&#x27;s social power over non-dominant groups. Ideologies use a society&#x27;s symbol system to organize social relations in a hierarchy, with some social identities being superior to other social identities, which are considered inferior. The dominant ideology in a society is passed along through the society&#x27;s major social institutions, such as the media, the family, education, and religion. As societies changed throughout history, so did the ideologies that justified systems of inequality.

Sociological examples of ideologies include racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, and ethnocentrism.

==Quotations==
* &quot;We do not need…to believe in an ideology. All that is necessary is for each of us to develop our good human qualities. The need for a sense of universal responsibility affects every aspect of modern life.&quot; — Dalai Lama
* &quot;The function of ideology is to stabilize and perpetuate dominance through masking or illusion.&quot; — Sally Haslanger
* &quot;[A]n ideology differs from a simple opinion in that it claims to possess either the key to history, or the solution for all the &#x27;riddles of the universe,&#x27; or the intimate knowledge of the hidden universal laws, which are supposed to rule nature and man.&quot; — Hannah Arendt

<text>Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) is an economic analysis tool to determine the most cost-effective option to purchase, run, sustain or dispose of an object or process. The method is popular in helping managers determine economic sustainability by figuring out the life cycle of a product or process.

==Definition==
The term differs slightly from Total cost of ownership analysis (TCOA). LCCA determines the most cost-effective option to purchase, run, sustain or dispose of an object or process, and TCOA is used by managers or buyers to analyze and determine the direct and indirect cost of an item.

The term is used in the study of Industrial ecology (IE). The purpose of IE is to help managers make informed decisions by tracking and analyzing products, resources and wastes.

===Green Design and Building Economics===
In Green design Managers add their operating costs and capital to help decide the effect of an investment. The method also allows managers to determine if more investments may be needed for green buildings.

<text>Transportation planning is the process of defining future policies, goals, investments, and spatial planning designs to prepare for future needs to move people and goods to destinations. As practiced today, it is a collaborative process that incorporates the input of many stakeholders including various government agencies, the public and private businesses. Transportation planners apply a multi-modal and/or comprehensive approach to analyzing the wide range of alternatives and impacts on the transportation system to influence beneficial outcomes.

Transportation planning is also commonly referred to as transport planning internationally, and is involved with the evaluation, assessment, design, and siting of transport facilities (generally streets, highways, bike lanes, and public transport lines).

==Models and sustainability ==


Transportation planning, or transport planning, has historically followed the rational planning model of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing plans. Other models for planning include rational actor, transit oriented development, satisficing, incremental planning, organizational process, collaborative planning, and political bargaining.

Planners are increasingly expected to adopt a multidisciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of environmentalism. For example, the use of behavioural psychology to persuade drivers to abandon their automobiles and use public transport instead. The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies. For example, in Hanoi, the increasing number of motorcycles is responsible for not only environmental damage but also slowing down economic growth. In the long run, the plan is to reduce traffic through a change in urban planning. Through economic incentives and attractive alternatives experts hope to lighten traffic in the short run.

While quantitative methods of observing transport patterns are considered foundation in transport planning, the role of qualitative and mixed-methods analysis and the use of critical analytical frameworks has increasingly been recognized as a key aspect of transport planning practice which integrates multiple planning criteria in generating, evaluating, and selection policy and project options.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, transport planning has traditionally been a branch of civil engineering. In the 1950s and the 1960s, it was generally believed that the motor car was an important element in the future of transport as economic growth spurred on car ownership figures. The role of the transport planner was to match motorway and rural road capacity against the demands of economic growth. Urban areas would need to be redesigned for the motor vehicle or impose traffic containment and demand management to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts. The policies were popularised in a 1963 government publication, &quot;Traffic in Towns&quot;. The contemporary Smeed Report on congestion pricing was initially promoted to manage demand but was deemed politically unacceptable. In more recent times, the approach has been caricatured as &quot;predict and provide&quot; to predict future transport demand and provide the network for it, usually by building more roads.

The publication of Planning Policy Guidance 13 in 1994 (revised in 2001), followed by A New Deal for Transport in 1998 and the white paper Transport Ten Year Plan 2000 again indicated an acceptance that unrestrained growth in road traffic was neither desirable nor feasible. The worries were threefold: concerns about congestion, concerns about the effect of road traffic on the environment (both natural and built) and concerns that an emphasis on road transport discriminates against vulnerable groups in society such as the poor, the elderly and the disabled.

These documents reiterated the emphasis on integration:
* integration within and between different modes of transport
* integration with the environment
* integration with land use planning
* integration with policies for education, health and wealth creation.

This attempt to reverse decades of underinvestment in the transport system has resulted in a severe shortage of transport planners. It was estimated in 2003 that 2,000 new planners would be required by 2010 to avoid jeopardizing the success of the Transport Ten Year Plan.

In 2006, the Transport Planning Society defined the key purpose of transport planning as:

::&quot;to plan, design, deliver, manage and review transport, balancing the needs of society, the economy and the environment.&quot;

The following key roles must be performed by transport planners:
* take account of the social, economic and environmental context of their work
* understand the legal, regulatory policy and resource framework within which they work
* understand and create transport policies, strategies and plans that contribute to meeting social, economic and environmental needs
* design the necessary transport projects, systems and services
* understand the commercial aspects of operating transport systems and services
* know about and apply the relevant tools and techniques
* must be competent in all aspects of management, in particular communications, personal skills and project management.

The UK Treasury recognises and has published guidance on the systematic tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic in their initial estimates.

== United States ==
Transportation planning in the United States is in the midst of a shift similar to that taking place in the United Kingdom, away from the single goal of moving vehicular traffic and towards an approach that takes into consideration the communities and lands through which streets, roads, and highways pass (&quot;the context&quot;). More so, it places a greater emphasis on passenger rail networks, which had been neglected until recently. This new approach, known as Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS), seeks to balance the need to move people efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes, including historic preservation, environmental sustainability, and the creation of vital public spaces.

The initial guiding principles of CSS came out of the 1998 &quot;Thinking Beyond the Pavement&quot; conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments, as well as the economic and social assets of the neighborhoods they pass through. CSS principles have since been adopted as guidelines for highway design in federal legislation. Also, in 2003, the Federal Highway Administration announced that under one of its three Vital Few Objectives (Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining) they set the target of achieving CSS integration within all state Departments of Transportation by September 2007.

In recent years, there has been a movement to provide &quot;complete&quot; transportation corridors under the &quot;complete streets&quot; movement. In response to auto-centric design of transportation networks, complete streets encompass all users and modes of transportation in a more equitable manner. The complete streets movement entails many of the CSS principles as well as pedestrian, bicycle and older adult movements to improve transportation in the United States.

These recent pushes for changes to the profession of transportation planning has led to the development of a professional certification program by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the Professional Transportation Planner in 2007. In response an advanced form of certification - the Advanced Specialty Certification in Transportation Planning was developed by the American Planning Association thereafter in 2011. The Certified Transportation Planner credential is only available for those professional planners (AICP members) who have at a minimum of eight years of transportation planning experience.

===Technical process===
Most regional transport planners employ what is called the rational model of planning. The model views planning as a logical and technical process that uses the analysis of quantitative data to decide how to best invest resources in new and existing transport infrastructure.

Since World War II, this attitude in planning has resulted in the widespread use of travel modelling as a key component of regional transport planning. The models&#x27; rise in popularity can also be attributed to a rapid increase in the number of automobiles on the road, widespread suburbanization and a large increase in federal or national government spending upon transport in urban areas. All of these phenomena dominated the planning culture in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Regional transport planning was needed because increasingly cities were not just cities anymore, but parts of a complex regional system.

The US process, according to Johnston (2004) and the FHWA and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) (2007), generally follows a pattern which can be divided into three different stages. Over the course of each of three phases, the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is also supposed to consider air quality and environmental issues, look at planning questions in a fiscally constrained way and involve the public. In the first stage, called preanalysis, the MPO considers what problems and issues the region faces and what goals and objectives it can set to help address those issues. During this phase the MPO also collects data on wide variety of regional characteristics, develops a set of different alternatives that will be explored as part of the planning process and creates a list of measurable outcomes that will be used to see whether goals and objectives have been achieved. Johnston notes that many MPOs perform weakly in this area, and though many of these activities seem like the &quot;soft&quot; aspects of planning that are not really necessary, they are absolutely essential to ensuring that the models used in second phase are accurate and complete .

The second phase is technical analysis. The process involves much technical maneuvering, but basically the development of the models can be broken down as follows. Before beginning, the MPO collects enormous amounts of data. This data can be thought of as falling into two categories: data about the transport system and data about adjacent land use. The best MPOs are constantly collecting this data.

The actual analysis tool used in the US is called the Urban Transportation Modeling System (UTMS), though it is often referred to as the four-step process. As its nickname suggestions, UTMS has four steps: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and trip/route assignment. In trip generation, the region is subdivided into a large number of smaller units of analysis called traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Based on the number and characteristics of the households in each zone, a certain number of trips is generated. In the second step, trip distribution, trips are separated out into categories based on their origin and purpose: generally, these categories are home-based work, home-based other and non-home based. In each of three categories, trips are matched to origin and destination zones using the data that has been collected.

In mode choice, trips are assigned to a mode (usually auto or transit) based on what&#x27;s available in a particular zone, the characteristics of the household within that zone and the cost of the mode for each mode in terms of money and time. Since most trips by bicycle or walking are generally shorter, they are assumed to have stayed within one zone and are not included in the analysis. Finally, in route assignment, trips are assigned to the network. As particular parts of the network are assigned trips, the vehicle speed slows down, so some trips are assigned to alternate routes in such a way that all trip times are equal. This is important because the ultimate goal is system-wide optimization, not optimization for any one individual. The finished product is traffic flows and speeds for each link in the network.

Ideally, these models would include all the different behaviours that are associated with transport, including complex policy questions which are more qualitative in nature. Because of the complexity of transport issues, this is often not possible in practice. This results in models which may estimate future traffic conditions well, but are ultimately based on assumptions made on the part of the planner. Some planners carry out additional sub-system modelling on things like automobile ownership, time of travel, location of land development, location and firms and location of households to help to fill these knowledge gaps, but what are created are nevertheless models, and models always include some level of uncertainty.

The post-analysis phase involves plan evaluation, programme implementation and monitoring of the results. Johnston notes that for evaluation to be meaningful it should be as comprehensive as possible. For example, rather than just looking at decreases in congestion, MPOs should consider economic, equity and environmental issues.

===Intersection with politics===
Although a transportation planning process may appear to be a rational process based on standard and objective methodologies, it is often influenced by political processes. Transportation planning is closely interrelated to the public nature of government works projects. As a result, transportation planners play both a technical and a coordinating role. Politicians often have vastly differing perspectives, goals and policy desires. Transportation planners help by providing information to decision makers, such as politicians, in a manner that produces beneficial outcomes. This role is similar to transportation engineers, who are often equally influenced by politics in the technical process of transportation engineering design.

===Integration with urban planning===
Transport isochrone maps are a measure of accessibility which can be used by urban planners to evaluate sites.

<text>Ricinus communis, the castor bean or castor oil plant, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is the sole species in the monotypic genus, Ricinus, and subtribe, Ricininae. The evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools. It reproduces with a mixed pollination system which favors selfing by geitonogamy but at the same time can be an out-crosser by anemophily (wind pollination) or entomophily (insect pollination).

Its seed is the castor bean, which despite the term is not a bean (as it is not the seed of a member of the family Fabaceae). Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, East Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant).

Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed also contains ricin, a highly potent water-soluble toxin, which is also present in lower concentrations throughout the plant .

The plant known as &quot;false castor oil plant&quot;, &quot;Fatsia japonica&quot;, is not closely related.

==Description==
&quot;Ricinus communis&quot; can vary greatly in its growth habit and appearance. The variability has been increased by breeders who have selected a range of cultivars for leaf and flower colours, and for oil production. It is a fast-growing, suckering shrub that can reach the size of a small tree, around , but it is not cold hardy.

The glossy leaves are long, long-stalked, alternate and palmate with five to twelve deep lobes with coarsely toothed segments. In some varieties they start off dark reddish purple or bronze when young, gradually changing to a dark green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, as they mature. The leaves of some other varieties are green practically from the beginning, whereas in yet others a pigment masks the green color of all the chlorophyll-bearing parts, leaves, stems and young fruit, so that they remain a dramatic purple-to-reddish-brown throughout the life of the plant. Plants with the dark leaves can be found growing next to those with green leaves, so there is most likely only a single gene controlling the production of the pigment in some varieties. The stems and the spherical, spiny seed capsules also vary in pigmentation. The fruit capsules of some varieties are more showy than the flowers.

The flowers lack petals and are unisexual (male and female) where both types are borne on the same plant (monoecious) in terminal panicle-like inflorescences of green or, in some varieties, shades of red. The male flowers are numerous, yellowish-green with prominent creamy stamens; the female flowers, borne at the tips of the spikes, lie within the immature spiny capsules, are relatively few in number and have prominent red stigmas.

The fruit is a spiny, greenish (to reddish-purple) capsule containing large, oval, shiny, bean-like, highly poisonous seeds with variable brownish mottling. Castor seeds have a warty appendage called the caruncle, which is a type of elaiosome. The caruncle promotes the dispersal of the seed by ants (myrmecochory).

=== Chemistry ===
Three terpenoids and a tocopherol-related compound have been found in the aerial parts of &quot;Ricinus&quot;. Compounds named (3&quot;E&quot;,7&quot;Z&quot;,11&quot;E&quot;)-19-hydroxycasba-3,7,11-trien-5-one, 6α-hydroxy-10β-methoxy-7α,8α-epoxy-5-oxocasbane-20,10-olide, 15α-hydroxylup-20(29)-en-3-one, and (2&quot;R&quot;,4a&quot;R&quot;,8a&quot;R&quot;)-3,4,4a,8a-tetrahydro-4a-hydroxy-2,6,7,8a-tetramethyl-2-(4,8, 12-trimethyltridecyl)-2&quot;H&quot;-chromene-5,8-dione were isolated from the methanol extracts of &quot;Ricinus communis&quot; by chromatographic methods.
Partitioned h-hexane fraction of &quot;Ricinus&quot; root methanol extract resulted in enrichment of two triterpenes: lupeol and urs-6-ene-3,16-dione (erandone). Crude methanolic extract, enriched n-hexane fraction and isolates at doses 100 mg/kg p.o. exhibited significant (P &lt; 0.001) anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced hind paw oedema model.

== Etymology ==
Carl Linnaeus used the name &quot;Ricinus&quot; because it is a Latin word for tick; the seed is so named because it has markings and a bump at the end that resemble certain ticks. The genus &quot;Ricinus&quot; also exists in zoology, and designates insects (not ticks) which are parasites of birds; this is possible because the names of animals and plants are governed by different nomenclature codes.

The common name &quot;castor oil&quot; probably comes from its use as a replacement for castoreum, a perfume base made from the dried perineal glands of the beaver (&quot;castor&quot; in Latin). It has another common name, palm of Christ, or &quot;Palma Christi&quot;, that derives from castor oil&#x27;s reputed ability to heal wounds and cure ailments.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Ricinus communis&quot; is the host plant of the common castor butterfly (&quot;Ariadne merione&quot;), the eri silkmoth (&quot;Samia cynthia ricini&quot;), and the castor semi-looper moth (&quot;Achaea janata&quot;). It is also used as a food plant by the larvae of some other species of Lepidoptera, including &quot;Hypercompe hambletoni&quot; and the nutmeg (&quot;Discestra trifolii&quot;). A jumping spider &quot;Evarcha culicivora&quot; has an association with &quot;R. communis&quot;. They consume the nectar for food and preferentially use these plants as a location for courtship.

Each castor seed has a yellow nodule full of fats one end of the seed that are nutritious for young ants. After hauling their harvest into their nests and pulling off the delicious part, ants discard the rest of the seed into their trash pile, where the future plant starts to grow.

== Cultivation ==
Although &quot;Ricinus communis&quot; is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, today it is widespread throughout tropical regions. In areas with a suitable climate, castor establishes itself easily where it can become an invasive plant and can often be found on wasteland.

It is also used extensively as a decorative plant in parks and other public areas, particularly as a &quot;dot plant&quot; in traditional bedding schemes. If sown early, under glass, and kept at a temperature of around until planted out, the castor oil plant can reach a height of in a year. In areas prone to frost it is usually shorter, and grown as if it were an annual. However, it can grow well outdoors in cooler climates, at least in southern England, and the leaves do not appear to suffer frost damage in sheltered spots, where it remains evergreen. It was used in Edwardian times in the parks of Toronto, Canada. Although not cultivated there, the plant grows wild in the US, notably Griffith Park in Los Angeles. 

===Cultivars===
Cultivars have been developed by breeders for use as ornamental plants (heights refer to plants grown as annuals) and for commercial production of castor oil.

== Allergenicity and toxicity ==
&quot;Ricinus&quot; is extremely allergenic, and has an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. The plant is also a very strong trigger for asthma, and allergies to &quot;Ricinus&quot; are commonplace and severe.

The castor oil plant produces abundant amounts of very light pollen, which easily become airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs, triggering allergic reactions. The sap of the plant causes skin rashes. People who are allergic to the plant can also develop rashes from touching the leaves, flowers, or seeds. They can also have cross-allergic reactions to latex sap from the related &quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot; plant.

The toxicity of raw castor beans is due to the presence of ricin. Although the lethal dose in adults is considered to be four to eight seeds, reports of actual poisoning are relatively rare. According to the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, this is the world&#x27;s most poisonous common plant.

If ricin is ingested, symptoms commonly begin within two to four hours, but may be delayed by up to 36 hours. These include a burning sensation in mouth and throat, abdominal pain, purging and bloody diarrhea. Within several days there is severe dehydration, a drop in blood pressure and a decrease in urine. Unless treated, death can be expected to occur within 3–5 days; however, in most cases a full recovery can be made.

Poisoning occurs when animals, including humans, ingest broken castor beans or break the seed by chewing: intact seeds may pass through the digestive tract without releasing the toxin. The toxin provides the castor oil plant with some degree of natural protection from insect pests such as aphids. Ricin has been investigated for its potential use as an insecticide.

Commercially available cold-pressed castor oil is not toxic to humans in normal doses, whether internal or external.

== Uses ==

=== Folk medicine ===
Castor oil and the plant&#x27;s roots and leaves are used in the ancient Indian medicinal system of Ayurveda.

=== Modern commercial usage ===
Global castor seed production is around two million tons per year. Leading producing areas are India (with over three-quarters of the global yield), China and Mozambique, and it is widely grown as a crop in Ethiopia. There are several active breeding programmes.

Other modern uses of natural, blended, or chemically altered castor products include:
* As a non-freezing, antimicrobial, pressure-resistant lubricant for special purposes, either of latex or metals, or as a lubricating component of fuels.
* As sources of various chemical feedstocks.
* As a raw material for some varieties of biodiesel.
* As attractively patterned, low-cost personal adornments, such as non-durable necklaces and bracelets. Holes must not be drilled in the beans to make beads. The outer shell protects the wearer from the poison. Wearing castors beans has been known to cause rashes, and worse.
* As a component of many cosmetics.
* As an anti-microbial. The high percentage of ricinoleic acid residues in castor oil and its derivatives, inhibits many microbes, whether viral, bacterial or fungal. They accordingly are useful components of many ointments and similar preparations.
* As the major raw material (in oil form) for polyglycerol polyricinoleate, a modifier that improves the flow characteristics of cocoa butter in the manufacture of chocolate bars, and thereby reduces the costs.
* As a repellent for moles and voles in lawns.

=== Historical usage ===
==== Ancient uses ====
Castor seeds have been found in Egyptian tombs dating back to 4000 BC; the slow-burning oil was mostly used to fuel lamps. Herodotus and other Greek travellers noted the use of castor seed oil for lighting, body ointments, and improving hair growth and texture. Cleopatra is reputed to have used it to brighten the whites of her eyes. The Ebers Papyrus is an ancient Egyptian medical treatise believed to date from 1552 BC. Translated in 1872, it describes castor oil as a laxative.

The use of castor bean oil (&quot;eranda&quot;) in India has been documented since 2000 BC in lamps and in local medicine as a laxative, purgative, and cathartic in Unani, Ayurvedic, siddha and other ethnomedical systems. Traditional Ayurvedic and siddha medicine considers castor oil the king of medicinals for curing arthritic diseases. It is regularly given to children to treat infections with parasitic worms.

The ancient Romans had a variety of medicinal/cosmetic uses for both the seeds and the leaves of &quot;Ricinus communis&quot;. The naturalist Pliny the Elder cited the poisonous qualities of the seeds, but mentioned that they could be used to form wicks for oil lamps (possibly if crushed together), and the oil for use as a laxative and lamp oil. He also recommends the use of the leaves as follows:

In Haiti it is called &quot;maskreti&quot;, where the plant is turned into a red oil that is then given to newborns as a purgative to cleanse the insides of their first stools.

Castor seed and its oil have also been used in China for centuries, mainly prescribed in local medicine for internal use or use in dressings.

==== Uses in punishment ====

Castor oil was used as an instrument of coercion by the paramilitary Blackshirts under the regime of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and by the Spanish Civil Guard in Francoist Spain. Dissidents and regime opponents were forced to ingest the oil in large amounts, triggering severe diarrhea and dehydration, which could ultimately cause death. This punishment method was originally thought of by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio, the Italian poet and Fascist supporter, during the First World War.

=== Other uses ===
Extract of &quot;Ricinus communis&quot; exhibited acaricidal and insecticidal activities against the adult of &quot;Haemaphysalis bispinosa&quot; (Acarina: Ixodidae) and hematophagous fly &quot;Hippobosca maculata&quot; (Diptera: Hippoboscidae).

Members of the Bodo tribe of Bodoland in Assam, India, use the leaves of the plant to feed the larvae of muga and endi silkworms.

Castor oil is an effective motor lubricant and has been used in internal combustion engines, including those of World War I airplanes, some racing cars and some model airplanes. It has historically been popular for lubricating two-stroke engines due to high resistance to heat compared to petroleum-based oils. It does not mix well with petroleum products, particularly at low temperatures, but mixes better with the methanol-based fuels used in glow model engines. In total-loss-lubrication applications, it tends to leave carbon deposits and varnish within the engine. It has been largely replaced by synthetic oils that are more stable and less toxic.

Jewellery can be made of castor beans, particularly necklaces and bracelets. Holes must not be drilled into the castor beans as the shell protects the wearer from the ricin. Any chips in the shell can cause poisoning of the wearer. Pets who chew the jewellery can become ill.

&quot;Ricinus communis&quot; leaves are used in botanical printing (also known as ecoprinting) in Asia. When bundled with cotton or silk fabric and steamed, the leaves can produce a green-colored imprint.

<text>La Grande Arche de la Défense (; &quot;The Great Arch of the Defense&quot;), originally called La Grande Arche de la Fraternité (; &quot;Fraternity&quot;), is a monument and building in the business district of La Défense and in the commune of Puteaux, to the west of Paris, France. It is usually known as the Arche de la Défense or simply as La Grande Arche. A cube, La Grande Arche is part of the perspective from the Louvre to Arc de Triomphe, and was one of the Grands Projets of François Mitterrand. The distance from La Grande Arche to Arc de Triomphe is .

==Design and construction==

A great national design competition was launched in 1982 as the initiative of French president François Mitterrand. Danish architect Johan Otto von Spreckelsen (1929–1987) and Danish engineer Erik Reitzel (1941–2012) designed the winning entry to be a late-20th-century version of the Arc de Triomphe: a monument to humanity and humanitarian ideals rather than military victories. The construction of the monument began in 1985, with most of the work being carried out by French civil engineering company Bouygues. Spreckelsen resigned in July 1986 and ratified the transfer of all his architectural responsibilities to his associate, French architect Paul Andreu. Reitzel continued his work until the monument was completed in 1989. The Grande Arche is in the approximate shape of a cube with a width, height, and depth of ; it has been suggested that the structure looks like a hypercube (a tesseract) projected onto the three-dimensional world. It has a prestressed concrete frame covered with glass and is covered in Bethel Granite.

&quot;La Grande Arche&quot; was inaugurated in July 1989, with grand military parades that marked the bicentennial of the French Revolution. It completed the line of monuments that forms the Axe historique running through Paris. The Grande Arche is turned at an angle of 6.33° about the vertical axis. The most important reason for this turn was technical: with a Paris Métro station, an RER station, and a motorway all situated directly underneath the &quot;Arche&quot;, the angle was the only way to accommodate the structure&#x27;s giant foundations. In addition, from an architectural point of view, the turn emphasises the depth of the monument and is similar to the turn of the Louvre at the other end of the Axe Historique. In addition, the &quot;Arche&quot; is placed so that it forms a secondary axis with the two of the highest buildings in Paris at the time, the Tour Eiffel and the Tour Montparnasse.

The two sides of the &quot;Arche&quot; house government offices. The roof section was closed in 2010 following an accident without injury and the marble tiles which had begun to peel off were replaced with granite ones. It opened again in 2017 after seven years of renovation work. It features panoramic views of Paris and includes a restaurant and an exhibition area dedicated to photojournalism.

The void contains skeletal shafts for panoramic lifts and a PTFE-and-fibreglass tensile-membrane sunshade known as the &quot;Cloud&quot; (&quot;Le nuage&quot;).

The Danish architect, von Spreckelsen, chose Italian Carrara marble for the tile cladding of the façade, for the marble&#x27;s gleaming, milky white exterior. This caused structural problems, as marble is porous, rainwater got into its pores, and when the temperature froze, the ice in its pores cracked the marble, and tiles began buckling and falling down, luckily without, however, hitting, injuring or killing anyone. The monument had to be closed for a few years while French engineers (von Spreckelsen had retired from the project before it was completed and was dead by the time of the collapsing tiles) had the marble tiles removed and replaced with granite quarried in Vermont, which has proved durable, at a cost of some €200M.
