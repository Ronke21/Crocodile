<text>Charles Alfred &quot;Al&quot; Taliaferro (August 29, 1905 – February 3, 1969), was an American Disney comics artist who produced Disney comic strips for King Features Syndicate. Taliaferro is best known for his work on the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip. Many of his strips were written by Bob Karp.

==Family background==
The Taliaferros trace their origins to Northern Italy and were one of the early families who settled in the Colony of Virginia during the 17th century. The family name, originally , literally means &quot;Ironcutter&quot; in the Italian language.

==Early career==
After his family moved to Glendale, California, Taliaferro studied at the Art Institute of Los Angeles, California. Following his graduation, Taliaferro was hired as a designer for light fixtures. In January 1931, Taliaferro was hired by Walt Disney Studios as an animator, but soon transferred to the comic strip department.

At the time, Disney comics were limited to the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip, with Floyd Gottfredson as its main artist. Taliaferro was hired as an inker for Gottfredson&#x27;s drawings. Taliaferro also served as the inker for a model sheet for the Mickey Mouse character. The model sheet would later be featured in Disney merchandising.

Disney soon launched a &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; comic strip (1932–1939), based on the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; short film series. The strip debuted on January 10, 1932, as a Sunday comic strip. It would appear on a weekly schedule, in full color. The original writer and penciller for the comic strip was Earl Duvall, with Taliaferro serving as his inker. In 1933, Duvall quit the strip and the Disney studio, as he was hired by Leon Schlesinger Productions. Taliaferro replaced him as the comic strip&#x27;s penciller. The new main writer of the comic strip was Ted Osborne, but the comic strip also featured a number of stories written by Merrill De Maris.

The comic strip had started by introducing a new character, not based on any previous Disney animated short. The character was Bucky Bug, an anthropomorphic insect whose creation is credited to Duvall and Taliaferro. Bucky Bug would continue to be the star of the comic strip until March 4, 1934. He was the second Disney character (after Mickey Mouse) to become the star of his own comic strip series. The Bucky Bug stories were typical for a talking animal series, though every character was 
either an insect or another type of invertebrate.

The initial storyline of Taliaferro&#x27;s comic strip was a coming-of-age story. Bucky Bug is introduced as a boy, the only son of his family. He has 16 sisters. He departs the family home to see the world, eventually settles down in the city of insects called &quot;Junktown&quot;, and marries a local girl, called June Bug. June is the daughter of the town&#x27;s mayor. The city which Bucky inhabits was built on human garbage, every building or structure was once an item discarded by humans. Besides Bucky and June, the most prominent character of these stories was Bo Bug, Bucky&#x27;s best friend and sidekick. Bo was depicted as a hobo and always wore a top hat.

While Taliaferro did not draw more Bucky Bug stories after 1934, the Bucky Bug series would eventually be revived in comic book form by Western Publishing. Bucky and his supporting cast have since appeared in Disney magazines and newspapers in many countries.

In the 1930s, the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; film series was at the height of its popularity, due to its innovations in storytelling and professionalism in production methods. Other animation studios launched imitations with similar names, such as &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;, and &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot;. Taliaferro and Ted Osborne started producing comic strip adaptations of specific short films, as a tie-in to whichever &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; the Disney studio was trying to promote. In 1936, the comic strip started featuring the main cast of the hit short &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; (1933). Taliaferro was the first artist to adapt Big Bad Wolf and the Three Little Pigs into comics, as characters of serial fiction. While in animation the characters soon faded away, in comics they had staying power. The Big Bad Wolf series would be continued by other artists, long after Taliaferro stopped producing new stories for it.

==&quot;Donald Duck&quot;==
In 1934, Taliaferro and Osborne adapted the short film &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; (1934) into comic strip form. Their adaptation was published in newspapers between 16 September and 16 December 1934. The most prominent character introduced in the film was Donald Duck, and Taliaferro was the first artist to depict him in comics. Taliaferro&#x27;s depiction of Donald preceded Donald&#x27;s appearances as a supporting character in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; newspaper comic (under Floyd Gottfredson and Ted Osborne), the adaptation into a British comic strip by William A. Ward (in 1937), and the adaptation of Donald into a full-length Italian comic book by Federico Pedrocchi (in 1937).

Between August 30, 1936, and December 5, 1937, Taliaferro and Osborne depicted Donald in gag-a-week comic strips for the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; series. The strips were in pantomime style. Taliaferro came up with the idea of a solo comic strip for Donald Duck, but had trouble convincing his bosses to support his idea. He initially pitched the idea to Roy O. Disney, who rejected it. Taliaferro then produced three weeks-worth of episodes for a Donald Duck comic strip, brought them to Roy Disney, and asked him to offer the strip to King Features Syndicate for publication. King Features had syndicated all Disney comic strips up to this point. Roy Disney was not particularly interested in the project, but his brother Walt Disney could see potential in the project. Taliaferro&#x27;s original sample stories were rejected due to having &quot;weak gags&quot;. Taliaferro co-operated with writer Merrill De Maris to create new sample stories, but these were also rejected. Taliaferro then co-operated with writer Homer Brightman, and this time the sample stories were approved. Taliaferro&#x27;s idea was greenlighted and the new Donald Duck comic strip was about to begin.

On February 2, 1938, &quot;Donald Duck&quot; started appearing in daily newspapers. A Sunday version was added on December 10, 1939. Taliaferro&#x27;s was the strip&#x27;s main penciller, while Homer Brightman was its writer and came up with the gags. But Brightman was mostly a screenwriter, and soon quit the comic strip and returned to writing plots for animated short films. Brightman was replaced by Bob Karp, who would serve as Taliaferro&#x27;s main creative partner for the rest of his career. The inkers for the comic strip included Karl Karpé, Dick Moores, George Waiss, and Bill Wright. Taliaferro also relied on a number of assistant artists, including Ellis Eringer, Frank Grundeen, Al Hubbard, and Kay Wright.

While the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip was an adventure series, the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip continued to be a daily comedy series. Each episode featured Donald dealing with problems and humorous situations. Most of the strips featured stand-alone gags, although some ongoing plots were introduced. The strips often lacked dialogue.

==Supporting cast==
Taliaferro and Karp started introducing supporting characters from the &quot;Donald Duck&quot; cartoons, where the duo became the first to portray a number of Donald Duck universe characters in the comics. These comic strip debuts often even preceded the new characters&#x27; first film appearances, as the production schedule for animated films was extended over a much longer period than for comic strips. On March 17, 1938, they introduced Bolivar, Donald&#x27;s pet St. Bernard. The strip found humor in the fact that Bolivar rarely listens to his owner. Taliaferro&#x27;s design was based on the St. Bernard in the 1936 Mickey Mouse film, &quot;Alpine Climbers&quot;. On October 17, 1937, Taliaferro and Osborne introduced Huey, Dewey, and Louie, based on a film that was in production at the time, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Nephews&quot;. Taliaferro actually proposed the initial idea for the film, so that the studio would have duck counterparts to Morty and Ferdie Fieldmouse, the nephews of Mickey Mouse.

Gus Goose, the &quot;lazy and gluttonous&quot; cousin of Donald, was introduced on May 9, 1938, almost a year before Gus&#x27; film debut in &quot;Donald&#x27;s Cousin Gus&quot;, that was still in early stages of production. On November 4, 1940, Taliaferro and Karp introduced a comic strip version of Daisy Duck, as Donald&#x27;s new neighbor and love interest, shortly after her film debut in &quot;Mr. Duck Steps Out&quot; (1940). This was Daisy&#x27;s first appearance in comics, not counting her prototype, Donna Duck, who appeared earlier in the British comics and was later introduced by Taliaferro and Karp as Daisy&#x27;s rival. Grandma Duck, Donald&#x27;s grandmother, was introduced on September 27, 1943, and was created for the comic strip by Taliaferro and Karp. Taliaferro based the design of the character on his mother-in-law and her old-fashioned ways. Taliaferro&#x27;s version of Grandma is a hard-working farmer, but out of touch with the technological progress of the world surrounding her. Although not created by him, Scrooge McDuck joined the cast of the comic strip on February 13, 1951, and Ludwig Von Drake on September 25, 1961. Donald&#x27;s car, the &#x27;313&#x27;, or &#x27;1934 Belchfire Roustabout&#x27;, was designed by Taliaferro on July 1, 1938, from a car that Donald drove in his first titular film, &quot;Don Donald&quot; (1937). The car has been associated with the character in comics ever since.

==Retirement==
Taliaferro retired from the daily comic strip on October 10, 1967. He kept working on the Sunday version of the strip until his death in February, 1969. Since 1967, Taliaferro&#x27;s duties on the comic strip had mostly been handled by Frank Grundeed, who replaced Taliaferro as the main artist upon his retirement and death. Bob Karp remained the strip&#x27;s main writer until his retirement in 1974. The &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip continued with new writers and artists over the following decades: Greg Crosby (writer, 1974–1979), Frank Smith (artist, 1976–1986), Bob Foster (writer, 1980–1989), Jim Franzen (artist, 1986), Daan Jippes (artist, 1986–1987), Ulrich Schröder (artist, 1986), Jorgen Klubien (artist, 1986), Tony Strobl (artist, 1986–1987), Bill Langley (artist, 1987), Pete Alvarado (artist, 1987–1989), Larry Mayer (artist, 1987–1989), and finally Larry Knighton (artist, 1990–1995). In 1995, King Features decided to end the production of new episodes of the comic strip, and to start publishing reprints of older episodes.

==Reprints==
While many of Taliaferro&#x27;s strips were reprinted in Disney comic books, in only a few instances did he do original artwork for comic books. Among these was the Cheerios Premium Giveaway &quot;Donald Duck: Counter Spy&quot; (1947) and the cover of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; #107 (August 1949) plus two Bucky Bug stories in WDC&amp;S #39 (Dec. 1943) and #60 (Sept. 1945) and a one-page Donald and Goofy gag based on &quot;No Sail&quot; in the latter. Two children&#x27;s books with Disney characters he illustrated are &quot;Donald and His Cat Troubles&quot; (1948) and &quot;Donald Duck and the Hidden Gold&quot; (1951).

In 2015, IDW Publishing began three series of hardcover reprints of Taliaferro&#x27;s Disney comics under their imprint The Library of American Comics:
* &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Donald Duck: The Daily Newspaper Comics&quot;
* &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Donald Duck: The Sunday Newspaper Comics&quot;
* &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Silly Symphonies: The Complete Disney Classics&quot;

==Legacy==
Animation historian Jim Korkis noted that Taliaferro designed the mascot Litternaut in 1967 who adorned the public trash receptacles in Glendale into the 1970s and to this day is the official mascot of the &quot;Committee for a Clean &amp; Beautiful Glendale&quot;.

Taliaferro was posthumously honored with a Disney Legends award in 2003.

<text>In folklore, a mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as storms, shipwrecks, and drownings (cf. ). In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same traditions), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.

The male equivalent of the mermaid is the merman, also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry. Although traditions about and reported sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids, they are in folklore generally assumed to co-exist with their female counterparts. The male and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as merfolk or merpeople.

The Western concept of mermaids as beautiful, seductive singers may have been influenced by the sirens of Greek mythology, which were originally half-birdlike, but came to be pictured as half-fishlike in the Christian era. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been sightings of manatees or similar aquatic mammals. While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore, reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day.

Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s literary fairy tale &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1837). They have subsequently been depicted in operas, paintings, books, comics, animation, and live-action films.

== Etymologies ==

The English word &quot;mermaid&quot; has its earliest-known attestation in Middle English (Chaucer, &quot;Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot;, c. 1390). The compound word is formed from &quot;&#x27;&quot; (sea), and &quot;&quot;.

=== Mermin ===
Another English word &quot;†mermin&quot; ( in the OED) for &#x27;siren or mermaid&#x27; is older, though now obsolete. It derives from Old English , ad. &#x27;sea&#x27; + &#x27;female slave&#x27;, earliest attestation , as a gloss for &quot;siren&quot;, in &quot;Corpus Glossary&quot; (c. 725).

A Middle English example in a bestiary (c. 1220?; manuscript now dated to 1275–1300) is indeed a &#x27;mermaid&#x27;, part maiden, part fish-like.

Its Old High German cognate is known from biblical glosses and Physiologus.

The Middle High German cognate &#x27;, (mod. German &quot;&quot;), &quot;mermaid&quot;, is attested in epics, and the one in &quot;Rabenschlacht&quot; is a great-grandmother of Wittich; this same figure appears in an Old Swedish text a &#x27;, and in Old Norse a (&quot;siókona&quot; [sic.]; &quot;sea-woman&quot;).

Old Norse , masculine noun, is also listed as cognate to &quot;†mermin&quot;, as well as ON , modern Icelandic , and modern Norwegian &quot;marmæle&quot;.

=== Merewif ===
Old English is another related term, and appears once in reference not so much to a mermaid but a certain sea hag, and not well-attested later.

Its MHG cognate , also defined as &quot;&quot; in modern German with perhaps &quot;&quot; a valid English definition. The word is attested, among other medieval epics, in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, and rendered &quot;merwoman&quot;, &quot;mermaid&quot;, &quot;water sprite&quot;, or other terms; the two in the story are translated as ON (&quot;sea-women&quot;).

== Origins ==
The siren of Ancient Greek mythology became conflated with mermaids during the medieval period. Some European Romance languages still use cognate terms for &quot;siren&quot; to denote the mermaid, e.g., French and Spanish and Italian &quot;&quot;.

Some commentators have sought to trace origins further back into § Ancient Middle Eastern mythology.

=== Sirens ===

In the early Greek period, the sirens were conceived of as human-headed birds, but by the classical period, the Greeks sporadically depicted the siren as part fish in art.

==== Medieval sirens as mermaids ====

The siren&#x27;s part-fish appearance became increasingly popular during the Middle Ages. The traits of the classical sirens, such as using their beautiful song as a lure as told by Homer, have often been transferred to mermaids.

This change of the medieval siren from bird to fish were thought by some to be the influence of Teutonic myth, later expounded in literary legends of Lorelei and Undine; though a dissenting comment is that parallels are not limited to Teutonic culture.

==== Textual attestations ====

The earliest text describing the siren as fish-tailed occurs in the &quot;Liber Monstrorum de diversis generibus&quot; (seventh to mid-eighth century), which described sirens as &quot;sea girls&quot; () whose beauty in form and sweet song allure seafarers, but beneath the human head and torso, have the scaly tail-end of a fish with which they can navigate the sea.

&quot;Sirens are mermaids&quot; (Old High German/Early ) is explicit in the aforementioned Old German &quot;Physiologus&quot; (eleventh century).

The Middle English bestiary (mid-13th century) clearly means &quot;mermaid&quot; when it explains the siren to be a &quot;mereman&quot;, stating that she has a body and breast like that of a maiden but joined, at the navel, by a body part which is definitely fish, with fins growing out of her.

Old French verse bestiaries (e.g. Philipp de Thaun&#x27;s version, written c. 1121–1139) also accommodated by stating that a part of the siren may be bird or fish.

==== Iconographic attestations ====
In a ninth-century &quot;Physiologus&quot; manufactured in France (Fig., top left), the siren was illustrated as a &quot;woman-fish&quot;, i.e., mermaid-like, despite being described as bird-like in the text.

The Bodleian bestiary dated 1220–12 also pictures a group of fish-tailed mermaid-like sirens (Fig. bottom), contradicting its text which likens it to a winged fowl () down to their feet.

In the interim, the siren as pure mermaid was becoming commonplace, particularly in the so-called &quot;Second Family&quot; Latin bestiaries, as represented in one of the early manuscripts classified into this group (Additional manuscript 11283, c. 1170–1180s. Fig., top right).

====Mirror and comb====

While the siren holding a fish was a commonplace theme, the siren in bestiaries were also sometimes depicted holding the comb, or the mirror.

The comb and mirror became a persistent symbol of the siren-mermaid.

In the Christian moralizing context (e.g the bestiaries), the mermaid&#x27;s mirror and comb were held as the symbol of vanity.

=== Other Greek mythical figures ===
The sea-monsters Scylla and Charybdis, who lived near the sirens, were also female and had some fishlike attributes. Though Scylla&#x27;s violence is contrasted with the sirens&#x27; seductive ways by certain classical writers, Scylla and Charybdis lived near the sirens&#x27; domain. In Etruscan art before the sixth century BC, Scylla was portrayed as a mermaid-like creature with two tails. This may be tied to images of two-tailed mermaids ranging from ancient times to modern depictions, and is sometimes attached to the later character of Melusine. A sporadic example of sirens as mermaids (tritonesses) in Early Greek art (third century BC), can be explained as the contamination of the siren myth with Scylla and Charybdis.

The female oceanids, nereids and naiads are mythical water nymphs or deities, although not depicted with fish tails. &quot;Nereid&quot; and &quot;nymph&quot; have also been applied to actual mermaid-like marine creatures purported to exist, from Pliny (cf. §Roman Lusitania and Gaul) and onwards. Jane Ellen Harrison (1882) has speculated that the mermaids or tritonesses of Greek and Roman mythology may have been brought from the Middle East, possibly transmitted by Phoenician mariners.

The Greek god Triton had two fish tails instead of legs, and later became pluralized as a group. The prophetic sea deity Glaucus was also depicted with a fish tail and sometimes with fins for arms.

=== Ancient Middle Eastern mythology ===

==== Kulullû ====
Depictions of entities with the upper bodies of humans and the tails of fish appear in Mesopotamian artwork from the Old Babylonian Period onwards, on cylinder seals. These figures are usually mermen (&quot;kulullû&quot;), but mermaids do occasionally appear. The name for the mermaid figure may have been &quot;*kuliltu&quot;, meaning &quot;fish-woman&quot;. Such figures were used in Neo-Assyrian art as protective figures and were shown in both monumental sculpture and in small, protective figurines.

==== Syrian mermaid goddess ====
A mermaid-like goddess, identified by Greek and Roman writers as Derceto or Atargatis, was worshipped at Ashkelon. In a myth recounted by Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC, Derceto gave birth to a child from an affair. Ashamed, she abandoned the child in the desert and drowned herself in a lake, only to be transformed into a human-headed fish. The child, Semiramis, was fed by doves and survived to become a queen.

In the second century, Lucian described seeing a Phoenician statue of Derceto with the upper body of a woman and the tail of a fish. He noted the contrast with the grand statue located at her Holy City (Hierapolis Bambyce), which appeared entirely human.

In the myth, Semiramis&#x27;s first husband is named Onnes. Some scholars have compared this to the earlier Mesopotamian myth of Oannes, one of the &quot;apkallu&quot; or seven sages described as fish-men in cuneiform texts. While Oannes was a servant of the water deity Ea, having gained wisdom from the god, English writer Arthur Waugh understood Oannes to be equivalent to Ea, and proposed that surely &quot;Oannes had a fish-tailed wife&quot; and descendants, with Atargatis being one deity thus descended, &quot;through the mists of time&quot;.

Diodorus&#x27;s chronology of Queen Semiramis resembles the feats of Alexander the Great (campaigns to India, etc.), and Diodorus may have woven the Macedonian king&#x27;s material via some unnamed source. There is a mermaid legend attached to Alexander the Great&#x27;s sister, but this is of post-medieval vintage (see below).

=== Rational attempts at explanation ===

Sometime before 546 BC, Milesian philosopher Anaximander postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species, a theory that is sometimes called the Aquatic Ape Theory. He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged infancy, could not have survived otherwise.

There are also naturalist theories on the origins of the mermaid, postulating they derive from sightings of manatees, dugongs or even seals.

Still another theory, tangentially related to the aforementioned Aquatic Ape Theory, is that the mermaids of folklore were actually human women who trained over time to be skilled divers for things like sponges, and spent a lot of time in the sea as a result. One proponent of this theory is British author William Bond, who has written several books about it.

== Medieval literature ==

=== Merwomen in Germanic literature ===
==== Nibelungenlied ====
Two prophetic merwomen (MHG pl.: ), Sigelinde (MHG: Sigelint) and her maternal aunt Hadeburg (MHG: Hadeburc) are bathing in the Danube River when Hagen von Tronje encounters them (&quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, Âventiure 25).

They are called &quot;sjókonar&quot; (&quot;sea women&quot;) in the Old Norse &quot;Þiđreks saga&quot;. There is a swan maiden tale motif involved here (Hagen robs their clothing), but Grimm argued they must have actually been swan maidens, since they are described as hovering above water.

In any case, this brief segment became the &quot;foundational&quot; groundwork of subsequent water-nix lore and literature that developed in the Germanic sphere.

They are a probable source of the three Rhine maidens in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. Though conceived of as swan-maidens in Wagner&#x27;s 1848 scenario, the number being a threesome was suggested by the woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and Eugen Napoleon Neureuther in the Pfizer edition of 1843 (fig. on the left).

==== Rabenschlacht ====

Middle High German &quot;mereminne&quot; &#x27;mermaid&#x27; is mentioned, among other epics, in the &quot;Rabenschlacht&quot; (&quot;Battle of Ravenna&quot;, 13th cent.) of the Dietrich cycle. The mermaid (or ) is named Wâchilt and is the ancestress of the traitorous Wittich who carries him off at the time of peril to her &quot;submarine home&quot;.

This material has been found translated as a medieval &quot;Þiðreks saga&quot; only in a late, reworked Swedish version, i.e., one of the closing chapters of &quot;Ðiðriks saga&quot; (fifteenth century, also known as the &quot;Swedish epilogue&quot;). The mermaid/undine is here translated as Old Swedish .

The Old Norse &quot;Þiðreks saga&quot; proper calls the same mermaid a ( [sic.]) or &quot;sea-woman&quot;.

The genealogy is given in the saga: the sea-woman and Villcinus (Vilkinus), king of Scandinavia together had a son, Vaði (Wade) of (Sjóland=Sjælland, Zealand) who was a giant (); whose son was Velent (Wayland the Smith), whose son after that was Viðga Velentsson (Wittich or Witige), who became a companion/champion of King Þiðrekr (Dietrich von Bern).

Thus the saga is an early source which associates a famed clan of merfolk with a place in Denmark, i.e., Sjælland. Sjælland was the divided portion of Villcina-land inherited by the bastard prince Vaði/Wade according to the saga. The Swedish epilogue transposed the locations concerning the battle (from Italy to Germany), and claimed the rescued Viðga/Witige was brought to Sjælland. That is to say, the crucial battle had been in Ravenna, Northern Italy in the German epic &quot;Rabenschlacht&quot;), but the battle spot was changed to Gronsport, somewhere on the Moselle, in Northern Germany in the Swedish version.

== Folklore of Britain and Ireland ==
The Norman chapel in Durham Castle, built around 1078, has what is probably the earliest surviving artistic depiction of a mermaid in England. It can be seen on a south-facing capital above one of the original Norman stone pillars.
Mermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it. Several variants of the ballad &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot; depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather, and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to .

In another short ballad, &quot;Clerk Colvill&quot; (Child ballad No. 42), the mermaid seduces the title character and foretells his doom. It has been surmised that in the original complete version, the man was being penalized for spurning her, though the Scandinavian counterparts that tells the complete story feature an elf-woman or elf queen rather than mermaid. In &quot;The Mermaid&quot; (Child ballad 289), her sighting forebodes a vessel&#x27;s deadly shipwreck.

Mermaids have been described as able to swim up rivers to freshwater lakes. In one story, the Laird of Lorntie went to aid a woman he thought was drowning in a lake near his house; his servant pulled him back, warning that it was a mermaid, and the mermaid screamed at them that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant. But mermaids could occasionally be more beneficent; e.g., teaching humans cures for certain diseases. Mermen have been described as wilder and uglier than mermaids, with little interest in humans.

According to legend a mermaid came to the Cornish village of Zennor, where she used to listen to the singing of a chorister, Matthew Trewhella. The two fell in love, and Matthew went with the mermaid to her home at Pendour Cove. On summer nights, the lovers can be heard singing together. The legend, recorded by folklorist William Bottrell, stems from a fifteenth-century mermaid carving on a wooden bench at the Church of Saint Senara in Zennor.

Some tales raised the question of whether mermaids had immortal souls, answering in the negative.

In Scottish mythology, a &quot;ceasg&quot; is a freshwater mermaid, though little beside the term has been preserved in folklore.

Mermaids from the Isle of Man, known as &quot;ben-varrey&quot;, are considered more favorable toward humans than those of other regions, with various accounts of assistance, gifts and rewards. One story tells of a fisherman who carried a stranded mermaid back into the sea and was rewarded with the location of treasure. Another recounts the tale of a baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl, but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft. A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of apples to a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity.

In Irish lore, Lí Ban was a human being transformed into a mermaid. After three centuries, when Christianity came to Ireland, she was baptized. The Irish mermaid is called merrow in tales such as &quot;Lady of Gollerus&quot; published in the nineteenth century.

== Scandinavian folklore ==

=== Haffrue ===
The mermaid corresponds to Danish and Bokmål Norwegian , whereas merman answers to Danish/Norwegian &quot;havmand&quot;.

As a side-note, a supposed Old Norse &quot;haffrú&quot; is the etymological source of Norman French &quot;havette&quot; for a man-snatching water-sprite, according to one linguist.

An early description of the &quot;Havfrue&quot;, and her mate &quot;Havmand&quot;, was given by the Danish Bishop Pontoppidan (1753). They were considered the mating female and male of the creature, inhabiting the North Sea, and their offspring was called (var. ), as repeated by later commentators.

Though he was aware of fabulous fables being told about them, he was convinced such creature existed. But as they were non-human, he argued the term &quot;Havmand&quot; (merman) should be avoided, in favor of some coined term such as sea-ape (). He also knowingly employed Old Norwegian/Old Norse &quot;maryge&quot; [sic.] and &quot;hafstrambe&quot; [sic.] as the Norwegian names of the mermaid and merman respectively.

==== Havfrue cognates ====

The Icelandic cognate form is &#x27; with several synonyms, though instead of these the commonly used term today is &#x27;.

The Faroese forms are &quot;&quot; (). The Swedish form is , with other synonyms such as , or (&#x27;sea-fairy&#x27;, the maritime counterpart of the forest ).

=== Other aliases ===

The terms &quot;margýgur&quot; or &quot;havgýgur&quot; as aliases for mermaid were apparently current among the populace in modern-age Iceland, according to Jón Árnason alongside the &quot;marbendill&quot; (modern Icelandic for ON &quot;marmennill&quot;)

Benjamin Thorpe (1851) writing on Norwegian folklore gave &quot;margygr&quot; for mermaid (and &quot;marmennill&quot; for merman) as Norwegian folk terms, but these are interpolations, which the source, Andreas Faye&#x27;s &quot;Norske sagn&quot; (1833), only side-noted as occurrences of old terms in medieval literature.

=== General characteristics ===
The beautiful &quot;havfrue&quot; of Scandinavia may be benevolent or malicious, and legends about her abducting maidens (cf. infra) is given as a case of point for her malice.

It is said the &quot;havfrue&quot; will avenge harm done to it, as in the Norwegian anecdote of one who was lured near the ship, and had her hand cruelly lopped off on the gunwale. She caused a storm that nearly drowned the wicked sailor.

=== Omen, prophecy and wisdom ===

The appearance/sighting alone betides an impending storm. Norwegians do not wish to see the havfrue, as she heralds storm or bad weather (Norway). The appearance of the &quot;sjörå&quot; forebodes a storm or poor catch in Swedish tradition, much as the appearance of the skogsrå (wood-nymph) presages poor catch for the hunter. According to the superstitions of Swedish fishermen, if one saw a &quot;sjörå&quot; who was harbinger of tempest and bad catch, one should not tell his comrades but strike flint against steel to light a spark.

In other cases the Scandinavian mermaid is considered to be prophetic.

The tale type &quot;The Mermaid&#x27;s Message&quot; (, ML 4060) is recognized as a , i.e., a group of tales found in Scandinavia with parallels found elsewhere, according to the scheme devised by Reidar Thoralf Christiansen. This may not necessarily involve the mermaid&#x27;s spaeing, and in the following example of this ML type tale, she merely imparts wisdom: A fisherman who performs favors and earns the privilege to pose three questions to a mermaid. He inquires about the most suitable material for a flail, to which she answers calf&#x27;s hide, of course, and tells him he should have asked about how to brew water (into beer), which would have benefited him more greatly.

=== Merfolk as abductors ===

The Swedish ballad &quot;Hafsfrun&quot; (≈, SMB 23, TSB A 51) is an instance where a mermaid kidnaps a human girl at age fifteen, and when the girl&#x27;s brother accomplishes the rescue, the mermaid declares she would have cracked her neck if she knew she would be thus betrayed. The Swedish merman Hafsman[nen] steals a human woman to become his bride according to folklore.

=== Marmaele ===
As aforementioned, the mermaid () takes the merman () for husband, and produce children called &quot;marmæler&quot; (sing. , &quot;sea-talkers&quot;), which the fishermen sometimes bring home to gain insight into the future.

Early sources say that Norwegian fishermen who capture the &quot;marmæte&quot; or &quot;marmæle&quot; may bring them home but do not dare keep it for more than 24 hours before turning them back into the sea whence they found it.

=== Margýgr ===
Jón Árnason describes the &quot;margýgur&quot; as yellow-haired woman who is fish from the waist down, who drags careless seamen to the depths of the sea.

However, &quot;margygr&quot; literally means something like &quot;mer-troll&quot;, and in medieval tradition, the &quot;margygr&quot; is more of a &quot;sea monster&quot; or &quot;sea-ogress&quot;.

According to a version of the &quot;Saga of St. Olaf&quot; (Olaf II of Norway) the king encountered a &quot;margygr&quot; whose singing lulled voyagers to sleep causing them to drown and whose high-pitched shrieks drove men insane. Her physical appearance is described thus: &quot;She has a head like a horse, with ears erect and distended nostrils, big green eyes and fearful jaws. She has shoulders like a horse and hands in front; but behind she resembles a serpent&quot;. This &quot;margygr&quot; was also said to be furry like a seal, and gray-colored.

== Western European folklore ==
Melusine is a mermaid-like character from European folklore, cursed to take the form of a serpent from the waist down. Later depictions sometimes changed this to a fish tail. At some point, possibly in the late nineteenth century, her name became attached to the two-tailed mermaid of heraldry.

The alchemist Paracelsus&#x27;s treatise &quot;A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits&quot; (1566) spawned the idea that the water elemental (or water sprite) could acquire an immortal soul through marriage with a human; this led to the writing of De la Motte Fouqué&#x27;s novella &quot;Undine&quot;, and eventually to the famous literary mermaid tale, Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

During the Romanesque period, mermaids were often associated with lust.

== Byzantine and Ottoman Greek folklore ==
The conception of the &quot;siren&quot; as both a mermaid-like creature and part bird-like persisted in Byzantine Greece for some time. The &quot;Physiologus&quot; began switching the illustration of the siren as that a mermaid, as in a version dated to the ninth century. The tenth century Byzantine Greek dictionary &quot;Suda&quot; still favored the avian description.

There is a modern Greek legend that Alexander the Great&#x27;s sister Thessalonike turned into a mermaid () after her death, living in the Aegean. She would ask the sailors on any ship she encountered only one question: &quot;Is King Alexander alive?&quot;,() to which the correct answer was: &quot;He lives and reigns and conquers the world&quot; (Greek: &quot;Ζει και βασιλεύει και τον κόσμον κυριεύει&quot;). This answer would please her, and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell. Any other answer would enrage her, and she would stir up a terrible storm, dooming the ship and every sailor on board. This legend derives from an Alexander romance entitled the &quot;Phylláda tou Megaléxandrou&quot; (Φυλλάδα του Μεγαλέξανδρου) dating to the Ottoman Greece period, first printed in 1680.

== Eastern Europe ==

Rusalkas are the Slavic counterpart of the Greek sirens and naiads, often seducing sailors to their doom. The nature of rusalkas varies among folk traditions, but according to ethnologist D.K. Zelenin they all share a common element: they are the restless spirits of the unclean dead. They are usually the ghosts of young women who died a violent or untimely death, either by murder or suicide, before their wedding, especially by drowning. Rusalkas are said to inhabit lakes and rivers. They appear as beautiful young women with long pale green hair and pale skin, suggesting a connection with floating weeds and days spent underwater in faint sunlight. They can be seen after dark, dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name, luring them to the water and drowning them. The characterization of rusalkas as both desirable and treacherous is prevalent in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, and was emphasized by nineteenth-century Russian authors. The best-known of the great Czech nationalist composer Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s operas is &quot;Rusalka&quot;.

In &quot;Sadko&quot; (), an East Slavic epic, the title character—an adventurer, merchant, and &quot;gusli&quot; musician from Novgorod—lives for some time in the underwater court of the Sea Tsar and marries his daughter, Chernava, before finally returning home. The tale inspired such works as the poem &quot;Sadko&quot; by Alexei Tolstoy (1817–75), the opera &quot;Sadko&quot; composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and the painting &quot;Sadko&quot; by Ilya Repin.

== Chinese folklore ==

A merfolk race called the are described as populating its own nation in the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot; (&quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot;) compilation of Chinese geography and mythology, dating from the fourth century BC. The ancient work also included several types of human-headed fish, such as the or &quot;red ru fish&quot;; as well as creature with some humanlike qualities like the &quot;renyu&quot; () or &quot;human-fish&quot;.

Note that these are not of a specific gender, so they are not really conducive to being called &quot;mermaids&quot;, though some English (European) writers might use &quot;mermaid&quot; as shorthand.

There is also an account of the (; literally &quot;sea human fish&quot;), given in the &quot;Taiping guangji&quot; compilation, sourced from the work entitled &quot;Qiawenji&quot; (). The female of its kind had a head like beautiful woman&#x27;s, with hair like a horse&#x27;s tail, and white skin like jade without scales, covered with multicolored downy hair (or peach fuzz), and legless. The male and female had sexual organs like humans, so that widows and would keep them in their ponds, and the creatures could perform sexual intercourse normally as a human would.

An anecdote considered relevant concerns a &quot;renyu&quot; (&quot;human fish&quot;) allegedly seen by the ship carrying Zha Dao (), and emissary to Korea. She had an unkempt hairdo and scarlet mane extending to the back of her elbows. Zha ordered the crew to bring her aboard with poles, but she escaped. Zha explained that she was a &quot;renyu&quot;, adept at copulating with humans, and was a type of human dwelling in the sea. The anecdote in the lost &quot;Cuyiji&quot; (&quot;Records of Bygone Extraordinay Things&quot;) from the Northern Song period, survives in quotes, e.g., from &quot;leishu&quot; compilation &quot;Gujin tushu jicheng&quot; ( &quot;Comprehensive Compendium of Illustrations and Books, Ancient and Modern&quot;).

== Korean folklore ==
Korea is bound on three sides by the sea. In some villages near the sea in Korea, there are mysterious stories about mermaids. Mermaids have features just like humans. Kim Dam Ryeong, a mayor of the town, saved four captured mermaids from a fisherman, as recorded in the &quot;Eou yadam&quot; (&quot;unofficial histories&quot;). In Dongabaek Island of Busan is a tale of Princess Hwang-ok from Naranda, a mythical undersea kingdom of mermaids; this tale is based on the historical Heo Hwang-ok from India. Another tale concerns a mermaid named Sinjike () who warned fishermen of impending storms by singing and throwing rocks into the sea from Geomun Island. The island&#x27;s residents believed her to be a goddess of the sea and that she could predict the weather.

== Japanese folklore ==

The Japanese equivalent is . According to one dictionary, &quot;ningyo&quot; oftentimes refers to a &quot;half-woman and half-fish fabulous creature&quot;, i.e., mermaid, though not necessarily female, i.e., includes mermen.

Despite the dictionary stating it has the appearance of half-woman half-fish, the creature has been pictorialized rather as a being with a human female head sitting on a body which is entirely fish-like (see fig. right).

=== Ningyo flesh ===
The &quot;ningyo&quot;&#x27;s flesh was purported to be an elixir, and consuming its flesh said to bestow remarkable longevity.

A famous &quot;ningyo&quot; legend concerns the who is said to have partaken of the flesh of a merfolk and attained miraculous longevity and lived for centuries. It is not discernible whether the flesh was a female; a pair of translators call it &quot;flesh of a mermaid&quot; in one book, but merely a &quot;strange fish with a human face&quot; in another.

=== As yōkai ===
A &quot;ningyo&quot; might be counted as a &quot;yōkai&quot; since it is included in Toriyama Sekien&#x27;s &quot;Hyakki Yagyō&quot; series. Gender is unclear, as it is only described as a being with &quot;a human face, a fish body&quot;. However, Sekien&#x27;s &quot;ningyo&quot; picture actually represents a &quot;human-fish&quot; that lives in Western China, also known as the Di people , according to the inscription printed alongside. They are described in the &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; and translated as the &quot;Low People&quot; or the &quot;Di People&quot;.

==Indian, Southeast Asian, and Polynesian folklore==

In Hinduism, Suvannamaccha (literally &quot;golden mermaid&quot;) is a daughter of Ravana who also appears in the Thai and other Southeast Asian versions of Ramayana. She is a mermaid princess who tries to spoil Hanuman&#x27;s plans to build a bridge to Lanka but falls in love with him instead.

In Cambodia, she is referred as Sovanna Maccha, a favorite for Cambodian audiences.

=== Indonesia ===
In the Javanese culture of Indonesia, Nyai Roro Kidul is a sea goddess and the Queen of the Southern Seas; the mermaid queen is said to inhabit the southern beach in Java. She has many forms; in her mermaid form, she is called Nyai Blorong.

=== Philippines ===

In the Tagalog language mermaids are known as &quot;sirena&quot; and &quot;siyokoy&quot; respectively. The general term for mermaid among all ethnic groups is Sirena.

In the Philippines, mermaid concepts differ per ethnic group. Among the Pangasinense, the Binalatongan mermaid is a Queen of the sea who married the mortal Maginoo Palasipas and ruled humanity for a time. Among the Ilocano, mermaids were said to have propagated and spread through the union of the first Serena and the first Litao, a water god. Among the Bicolano, mermaids were referred as Magindara, known for their beautiful voice and vicious nature. Among the Sambal, mermaids called Mambubuno are depicted as having two fins, instead of one.

In the folktale &quot;Mermaid&quot; (Cebuano language: ) localized in Cebu and Bohol Provinces, a couple named Juan and Juana is about to have a daughter, but the pregnant wife has a constant craving for milkfish (Cebuano: ). One day his fishing caught nothing, but met a talking milkfish wearing a crown, the &quot;King of the Fishes&quot; (Cebuano: ) who offered to give him plenty every day, in exchange for the taking the child later, at 7 years of age. She was eventually swept away by the waves, and presumed lost to the king. The parents, hoping to see her again on the beach did so finally, on a moonlit night, witnessed a black haired woman with the body of a milkfish, whom they knew was Maria.

=== New Zealand ===
Mermaids and mermen are characters in the myth of &quot;Pania of the Reef&quot;, a well-known tale of Māori mythology, which has many parallels with stories of sea-people in other parts of the world.

== African folklore ==
Mami Water (Lit. &quot;Mother of the Water&quot;) are water spirits venerated in West, Central and southern Africa, and in the African diaspora in the Caribbean and parts of North, Central and South America. They are usually female, but are sometimes male. They are regarded as diabolical beings, and are often femme fatales, luring men to their deaths. The Persian word &quot;پری دریایی&quot; or &quot;maneli&quot; means &quot;mermaid&quot;.

Among the Shona of Zimbabwe, njuzu are mermaid-like spirits. The jengu, also known as the &quot;Itongo&quot; (Sea Queen), of Cameroon is sometimes depicted as half woman and half fish.

== Arabian folklore ==

=== &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; ===
The &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; collection includes several tales featuring &quot;sea people&quot;, such as &quot;Jullanâr the Sea-born and Her Son King Badr Bâsim of Persia&quot;. Unlike depictions of mermaids in other mythologies, these are anatomically identical to land-bound humans, differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater. They can (and do) interbreed with land humans, and the children of such unions have the ability to live underwater. In the tale &quot;Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman&quot;, the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land. The underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist. In &quot;The Adventures of Bulukiya&quot;, the protagonist Bulukiya&#x27;s quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas, where he encounters societies of mermaids.

== Americas folklore ==
The Neo-Taíno nations of the Caribbean identify a mermaid called &quot;Aycayia&quot; with attributes of the goddess Jagua and the hibiscus flower of the majagua tree &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;. In modern Caribbean culture, there are a number of mermaids that are derived from West African originals and taken by slaves. These include Watramama in Suriname and Guyana, Mamadjo in Grenada, Yemanya or Yemaya in Brazil and Cuba, Erzulie in Haiti), and Lamanté in Martinique. There is a mermaid recognized as a Haitian &quot;vodou&quot; loa called &quot;Lasirèn&quot; (from the French , &quot;the mermaid&quot;), representing wealth, beauty and romance, but also the possibility of death.

=== Iara and Ipupiara ===
In Brazilian folklore, the iara, also known as &quot;mãe-d&#x27;agua&quot; (&quot;lady/mother of the water&quot;) is a water-dwelling beauty whom fishermen are prone to fall prey to. According to eighteenth-century sources, she is a long-haired woman who enchant men by night, and those who scucumb die, &quot;drowned by passion&quot;. Folklore also blamed disappearances of men on the Iara who lured them singing in the indigenous language. 

The ascribed hair and eye color differs depends on the tradition in various regions. According to the tale of the Manaus tribe youth Jaguarari and the Yara, she has hair of the color of the pau d&#x27;arco tree&#x27;s flowers (var. green hair) and pink skin, while she is black-haired according to some. Other commentators insist Iara is a &quot;beautiful white woman who lives in a river&quot;, reputedly golden-haired, and blue-eyed though the blond, blue-eyed image was not attested until after the mid-nineteenth century, to the best knowledge of Camara Cascudo. Cascudo in his earlier writing contended that though the Iara was rooted in two indigenous beings, the water-devil Ipupiara (cf. below) and the Cobra-Grande, he also saw the combining of the Portuguese lore of the Enchanted Moura (moorish girl), who was obviously dark-skinned. The Iara became increasingly to be regarded as a woman-fish, after the image of the European sirens/mermaids.

It is often argued that the legends of the Iara developed around the eighteenth century out of the indigenous myth of the among the Tupinambá people. The Ipupiara was originally conceived of as a male water-dweller that carried fishermen to the bottom, devouring their mouths, nose, fingertips and genitals. European writers during the age of exploration disseminated the myth, but the (1576) included an illustration of &quot;Hipupiàra&quot; with female breasts. Subsequently the Jesuit wrote that the &quot;Igpupiàra&quot; also consisted of females that look like women with long hair. Though somewhat vague in the case of Gandavo, Cardim had clearly injected Christian opinion which would readily relegate the role of emasculating men to the female kind. Later with the introduction of African slaves, the Yoruba myth of Iemanjá was admixed into the telling.

=== Alamoa ===
The Alamoa is a well known legend in the island of Fernando de Noronha, northeast of the Brazilian mainland. An alluring half-naked woman, she who would seduced men by night, and the charmed lovers who followed her end up falling off the island cliff, off Pico hill. Again, modern commentary paints her as a &quot;beautiful white woman ()&quot;, which would be consistent with the name Alamoa being an older form of , which now means &quot;blonde, fair-skinned woman&quot; whereas older literature describes her as fulvous or tawny (), though dressed in white, as according to (d. 1923). According to one telling, on Friday nights, the rock of Pico splits and emits a light beam, followed by Alamoa&#x27;s appearance, attracting men; but she will then transform into skull and skeleton, resulting in disappearances, except cries of terror can be occasionally heard. The Alamoa evidently maintains an underwater palace as well. These elements (skull, light, palace) are lacking in European (Dutch) lore, though general similarity to Holland&#x27;s mermaid has been suggested.

== Reported sightings ==

=== Roman Lusitania and Gaul ===
In his &quot;Natural History&quot; 9.4.9–11, Pliny the Elder, remarked that a triton (merman) was seen off the coast of Olisipo (present-day Lisbon, Portugal), and it bore the physical appearance in accordance with common notion of the triton, according to a deputation from Lisbon who reported it to Emperor Tiberus. One nereid was sighted earlier on the same (Lisbon) coast. Pliny remarks that contrary to popular notion, the true nereids are not smooth-skinned in their human-like portions, but covered with scales all over the body. Their mournful songs at death have also been heard by the coastal inhabitants. Also, multiple nereids had washed up on the shore according to the legatus/governor of Gaul, who informed the late Emperor Augustus about it in a letter.

Sixteenth-century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus quotes the same passage from Pliny, and further notes that the nereid are said to utter &quot;dismal moans (wailings) at the hour of her death&quot;, thus observing a connection to the legend of sea-nymphs and the sister Fates whose clashing cymbals and flute tunes could be heard on shore. Olaus in a later passage states that the nereids (tr. &quot;mermaids&quot;) are known to &quot;sing plaintively&quot;, in general.

It has been conjectured that these carcasses of nereids washed up on shore were &quot;presumably seals&quot;.

=== Age of Exploration Americas and polar frontiers ===
In 1493, sailing off the coast of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus spotted three mermaids () which he said were not as beautiful as they are represented due to masculine features in their faces. He is widely believed to have seen manatees, not mermaids.

During Henry Hudson&#x27;s second voyage on 15 June 1608, members of his crew reported sighting a mermaid in the Arctic Ocean, either in the Norwegian or Barents Seas.

Dutch explorer David Danell during his expeditions to Greenland in 1652–54 claimed to have spotted a mermaid with &quot;flowing hair and very beautiful&quot;, though the crew failed to capture it.

==== Colonial Brazil ====
Danish physician and natural historian Thomas Bartholin wrote about a mermaid specimen caught in Brazil (probably a manatee) and subsequently dissected at Leiden. Though referred to in the text as a &quot;sea-man&quot; (&quot;homo marinus&quot;) from Brazil, the account was accompanied by an engraved drawing captioned &quot;Sirene&quot;, whose appearance was that of a humanoid female with bared breasts (a mermaid). The specimen&#x27;s body was deformed and &quot;without the sign of a tail&quot;, matching the drawing. And &quot;a membrane [that] join [the fingers] together&quot; is also reflected in the drawing as well (as her webbed pair of hands/forepaws).

The specimen&#x27;s account and illustration was later reproduced by Linnaeus, who captioned the beast &quot;Siren Bartholini&quot;, hence &quot;Bartholin&#x27;s Siren&quot;.

Bartholin was actually not the sole proprietor of the specimen, but he came into possession of its hand and ribs, which he also illustrated in his book (figures above). Based on the illustration, the &quot;hand&quot; has been determined to be the front flipper belonging to a manatee by a team of researchers.

Bartholin himself had argued that it was a sea mammal closely related to seals (&quot;phocae&quot;). His rationale was that since there are several marine counterparts to land mammals e.g. &quot;sea-horses&quot;, the possibility of a marine creature with striking likeness to humans could not be ruled out, though they should all be classified among seal-kind.

Erasmus Francisci (Erasmus Finx, 1668) associated this Brazilian specimen with the local native lore of the &quot;Yupiapra&quot; (Ipupiara).

=== Colonial Southeast Asia ===

==== Seventeenth-century Visayas ====

A type of mermaid referred to as &quot;anthropomorphus&quot; or &quot;woman-fish&quot; () allegedly inhabited the Spanish-ruled Philippines, particularly in the waters around the Visayan Islands, according to contemporary writings from the seventeenth century.

The accounts are found in several books, on various topics from magnetism, to natural history, to ecclesiastical history.

These books refer to the mermaid/merman as &quot;piscis anthropomorphos&quot; (), and emphasize how human-like they appear in their upper bodies, as well as providing woodcut or etchings illustrating the male and female of the part-human part-fish creature.

The &quot;woman-fish&quot; (or in modern Spanish)) was the name given to the creature among the Spaniards, but the sources also state it was called &quot;duyon&quot; by the indigenous people. and it is assumed the actual creature was a dugong (according to modern translators&#x27; notes).

Several of these sources mention the medical use of the woman-fish to control the flow of blood (or the four humours). It was effective for staunching the bleeding, i.e., effective against hemorrhages, according to Jonston. Other sources mention the ability to stop bleeding, e.g. Colín, who also thought that the Philippine woman-fish tasted like fatty pork. The bones were made into beads (i.e., strung together), as it was believed effective against s (of the humours).

==== Eighteenth-century Moluccas ====
Allegedly captured in the Moluccas in the seventeenth century was the so-called &quot;Amboina mermaid&quot; (after the then Dutch Province of Ambon), which its leading researcher has referred to as Samuel Fallours&#x27;s &quot;Sirenne&quot;, after the man who came into possession of it and made an original painting of it in full color.

The painting was reproduced by Louis Renard on the &quot;Fish&quot; of the region, first published in 1719,

It was supposedly caught by Boeren in Ambon Province (Buru, in present-day Maluku Province), presumably around the years 1706–1712, or perhaps the year 1712 precisely. During this period, Fallours served briefly as soldier for the VOC (Dutch East India Company) starting June 1706, but turned associate curate (Krankbezoeker) for the Dutch Reformed Church (September 1706 to June 1712).

Fallour&#x27;s mermaid with additional details were described by François Valentijn in a 1726 book.

The mermaid was 59 Dutch inches () long, or 5 feet in Rhineland measures. She reportedly survived 4 days 7 hours in a water tank, and died after refusing food it was given, having uttered no intelligible sound, or issuing sounds like screechings of a mouse (). Something like a straw cape (Japanese &quot;mino&quot;) appears wrapped around her waist in the painting according to one commentator, but Fallours revealed in his notes that he lifted the front and back fins and &quot;[found] it was shaped like a woman&quot;.

The mermaid was suspected to be a dugong in reality, even by contemporary scholars such as Georg Rumphius, although Valentijn was unable to believe they were the one and the same. Leading researcher Theodore W. Pietsch concurs with the dugong identification, but an ichthyologist has opined that &quot;I could more easily accept a small oar-fish, or another eel-like fish, rather than a dugong as a partial basis for the drawing&quot;, noting that Renard&#x27;s book carries an illustration of a plausibly realistic dugong as well.

=== Qing dynasty China ===
The &quot;Yuezhong jianwen&quot; (; &quot;Seens and Heards&quot;, or &quot;Jottings on the South of China&quot;, 1730) contains two accounts concerning mermaids. In the first, a man captures a mermaid ( &quot;sea woman&quot;) on the shore of Lantau Island (). She looks human in every respect except that her body is covered with fine hair of many colors. She cannot talk, but he takes her home and marries her. After his death, the mermaid returns to the sea where she was found. In the second story, a man sees a woman lying on the beach while his ship was anchored offshore. On closer inspection, her feet and hands appear to be webbed. She is carried to the water, and expresses her gratitude toward the sailors before swimming away.

=== U.S. and Canada ===
Two sightings were reported in Canada near Vancouver and Victoria, one from sometime between 1870 and 1890, the other from 1967. A Pennsylvania fisherman reported five sightings of a mermaid in the Susquehanna River near Marietta in June 1881.

=== Twenty-first century ===

In August 2009, after dozens of people reported seeing a mermaid leaping out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1 million award for proof of its existence.

In February 2012, work on two reservoirs near Gokwe and Mutare in Zimbabwe stopped when workers refused to continue, stating that mermaids had hounded them away from the sites. It was reported by Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, the water resources minister.

== Hoaxes and show exhibitions ==
=== Manufactured merfolk specimens ===
A celebrated example of mermaid hoax was the Fiji mermaid exhibited in London in 1822 and later in America by P. T. Barnum in 1842; in this case an investigator claims to have traced the mermaid&#x27;s manufacture to a Japanese fisherman.
Fake mermaids made in China and the Malay Archipelago out of monkey and fish parts were imported into Europe by Dutch traders since the mid-sixteenth century, and their manufactures are thought to go back earlier. The manufacture of mermaids from monkey and fish parts also occurred in Japan, especially in the Kyūshū region, as a souvenir industry targeting foreigners. Mōri Baien painted full color illustrations of such a compositely manufactured &quot;ningyo&quot; specimen in his ichthyological tract (1825). For much of the Edo Period, Nagasaki (in Kyūshū) was the only trade port open to foreign countries, and the only place where non-Japanese aliens could reside. Jan Cock Blomhoff, the Dutch East India Company director stationed in Dejima, Nagasaki is known to have acquired merfolk mummies; these and other specimens are now held in the National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden, Netherlands.
The equivalent industry in Europe was the Jenny Haniver made from dried rays.

In the middle of the seventeenth century, John Tradescant the elder created a wunderkammer (called Tradescant&#x27;s Ark) in which he displayed, among other things, a &quot;mermaid&#x27;s hand&quot;.

=== Mermaid shows ===
Scantily clad women placed in watertanks and impersonating mermaids performed at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. It was part of the &quot;Dream of Venus&quot; installation by Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí. The mermaid interacted with Oscar the Obscene Octopus, and the ongoings were portrayed in E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s novel &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot;.

Professional female divers have performed as mermaids at Florida&#x27;s Weeki Wachee Springs since 1947. The state park calls itself &quot;The Only City of Live Mermaids&quot; and was extremely popular in the 1960s, drawing almost one million tourists per year. Most of the current performers work part-time while attending college, and all are certified Scuba divers. They wear fabric tails and perform aquatic ballet (while holding their breath) for an audience in an underwater stage with glass walls. Children often ask if the &quot;mermaids&quot; are real. The park&#x27;s PR director says, &quot;Just like with Santa Claus or any other mythical character, we always say yes. We&#x27;re not going to tell them they&#x27;re not real&quot;.

The Ama are Japanese skin divers, predominantly women, who traditionally dive for shellfish and seaweed wearing only a loincloth and who have been in action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.

== Scientific inquiry ==
The topic of mermaids in earnest has arisen in several instances of scientific scrutiny, including a biological assessment of the unlikelihood of the supposed evolutionary biology of the mermaid on the popular marine science website &quot;DeepSeaNews&quot;. Five of the primary reasons listed as to why mermaids do not fit current evolutionary understanding are:
* thermoregulation (adaptations for regulating body heat);
* evolutionary mismatch;
* reproductive challenges;
* digestive differences between mammals and fish;
* lack of physical evidence.

Mermaids were also discussed in a scientific article by University of Washington emeritus oceanographer Karl Banse. His article was written as a parody, but mistaken as a true scientific exposé by believers as it was published in a scientific journal.

== Omens ==
The mermaid is a harbinger of shipwreck in English-Scottish balladry, though the attestation (Child ballad 289), dates no older than the 18th century. No analogues were found by Child outside the English language, though versions were transmitted to America.

In Norway the was considered the harbinger of &quot;storm and bad weather&quot; ( under Scandinavian Folklore).

The notion of the mermaid signifying bad omen is both Western and Eastern. A number of such omens were recorded in Japan by the Kamakura shogunate, for example, the entry in the &quot;Azuma kagami&quot; for 1247 (Hōji 1) records a beaching of a &quot;big fish&quot; (as it was called here), tied to the the same year. (Cf. for additional examples).

== Myth interpretations ==
According to Dorothy Dinnerstein&#x27;s book &quot;The Mermaid and the Minotaur&quot;, human-animal hybrids such as mermaids and minotaurs convey the emergent understanding of ancient peoples that humans were both one with and different from animals:
== Arts, entertainment, and media ==


=== Literature ===
The best-known example of mermaids in literature is probably Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, first published in 1837. The title character, youngest of the Merman-king&#x27;s daughters, falls in love with a human prince and also longs for an eternal soul like humans, despite the shorter lifespan. The two cravings are intertwined: only by achieving true love will her soul bind with a human&#x27;s and become everlasting. But the mermaid&#x27;s fish-tail poses an insurmountable obstacle for enticing humans, and a sea-witch offers a potion to transform into human form, at a price (the mermaid&#x27;s tongue and beautiful voice). The mermaid endures the excruciating pain of having human legs, and despite her inability to speak, almost succeeds in wedding the prince, but for a twist of fate. The mermaid is doomed unless she stabs the prince with a magic knife on his wedding night. She refuses to harm him and dies the mermaid way, dissolving into foam. However, her selflessness has earned her a second chance at salvation, and she is resurrected as an air spirit.

Andersen&#x27;s works has been translated into over 100 languages. One of the main literary influences for Andersen&#x27;s mermaid was &quot;Undine&quot;, an earlier German novella about a water nymph who could only obtain an immortal soul by marrying a human. Andersen&#x27;s heroine inspired a bronze sculpture in Copenhagen harbour and influenced Western literary works such as Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Fisherman and His Soul&quot; and H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Sea Lady&quot;.

Sue Monk Kidd wrote a book called &quot;The Mermaid Chair&quot; loosely based on the legends of Saint Senara and the mermaid of Zennor.

=== Art and music ===
Sculptures and statues of mermaids can be found in many countries and cultures, with over 130 public art mermaid statues across the world. Countries with public art mermaid sculptures include Russia, Finland, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Denmark, Norway, England, Scotland, Ireland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Turkey, India, China, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Guam, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, the Cayman Islands, Mexico, Saudi Arabia (Jeddah), the United States (including Hawaii and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and Canada. Some of these mermaid statues have become icons of their city or country, and are major tourist attractions in themselves. &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; statue in Copenhagen is an icon of that city as well as of Denmark. The Havis Amanda statue symbolizes the rebirth of the city of Helsinki. The Syrenka (mermaid) is part of the coat of Arms of Warsaw, and is considered a protector of Warsaw, which publicly displays statues of their mermaid.

An influential image was created by the Pre-Raphaelite painter John William Waterhouse, from 1895 to 1905, entitled &quot;A Mermaid&quot; (Cf. figure, top of page). An example of late British Academy-style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse&#x27;s place as a member of the Royal Academy), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s. It is currently once again in the Royal Academy&#x27;s collection. Waterhouse&#x27;s mermaid grooms her hair with comb and mirror, the stereotypical implements of the mermaid, likely designed to portray her as temptress, and her red hair (auburn hair) is a match for the hair colour of Venus. Waterhouses&#x27;s &quot;The Siren&quot; (1900) also depicts the siren as a mermaid of sorts, representing the &quot;femme fatale&quot; drawing men to destruction. In the modern age of course, the word &quot;siren&quot; is used as a synonym of &quot;femme fatale&quot;.

Mermaids were a favorite subject of John Reinhard Weguelin, a contemporary of Waterhouse. He painted an image of the mermaid of Zennor as well as several other depictions of mermaids in watercolour.

Musical depictions of mermaids include those by Felix Mendelssohn in his &quot;Fair Melusina&quot; overture and the three &quot;Rhine daughters&quot; in Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. Lorelei, the name of a Rhine mermaid immortalized in the Heinrich Heine poem of that name, has become a synonym for a siren. &quot;The Weeping Mermaid&quot; is an orchestral piece by Taiwanese composer Fan-Long Ko.

=== Motion pictures ===
Film depictions include &quot;Miranda&quot; (1948), &quot;Night Tide&quot; (1961), the romantic comedy &quot;Splash&quot; (1984), and &quot;Aquamarine&quot; (2006). A 1963 episode of the television series &quot;Route 66&quot; entitled &quot;The Cruelest Sea of All&quot; featured a mermaid performance artist working at Weeki Wachee aquatic park. Mermaids also appeared in the popular supernatural drama television series &quot;Charmed&quot;. In &quot;She Creature&quot; (2001), two carnival workers abduct a mermaid in Ireland and attempt to transport her to America. The film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; mixes old and new myths about mermaids: singing to sailors to lure them to their death, growing legs when taken onto dry land, and bestowing kisses with magical healing properties.

Disney&#x27;s musical animated version of Andersen&#x27;s tale, &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, was released in 1989. Notable changes to Andersen&#x27;s story include removing the religious aspects of the fairy tale, including the mermaid&#x27;s quest to obtain an immortal soul. The sea-witch herself replaces the princess to whom the prince becomes engaged, using the mermaid&#x27;s voice to prevent her from obtaining the prince&#x27;s love. However, on their wedding day the plot is revealed and the sea-witch is vanquished. The knife motif is not used in the film, which ends with the mermaid and the prince marrying.

Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Ponyo&quot; is an animated film about a ningyo who wants to become a human girl with the help of her human friend Sosuke.

The Australian teen dramedy &quot;H2O: Just Add Water&quot; chronicles the adventures of three modern-day mermaids along the Gold Coast of Australia.

The Starbucks coffee logo is a melusine.

=== Heraldry ===

In heraldry, the charge of a mermaid is commonly represented with a comb and a mirror, and blazoned as a &quot;mermaid in her vanity&quot;. In addition to vanity, mermaids are also a symbol of eloquence.

Mermaids appear with greater frequency as heraldic devices than mermen do. A merman and a mermaid are depicted on the coat of arms of Schouwen-Duiveland. A mermaid appears on the arms of the University of Birmingham, in addition to those of several British families.

A mermaid with two tails is referred to as a melusine. Melusines appear in German heraldry, and less frequently in the British version.

A shield and sword-wielding mermaid (&quot;Syrenka&quot;) is on the official coat of arms of Warsaw. Images of a mermaid have symbolized Warsaw on its arms since the middle of the fourteenth century. Several legends associate Triton of Greek mythology with the city, which may have been the origin of the mermaid&#x27;s association.

The Cusack family crest includes a mermaid wielding a sword, as depicted on a memorial stone for Sir Thomas Cusack (1490–1571).

Mermaids appear on the coat of arms of Ustka, Białobrzegi and Białobrzegi County (Poland), Seeboden am Millstätter See (Austria), Bray (Ireland), Santa Colomba de Curueño, Ruente, Bertizarana, Villanueva de la Serena (Spain), Päijät-Häme (Finland), Åsgårdstrand (Norway), Royat, Xammes, Lancieux, Erquy, Chens-sur-Léman, Didenheim, Wimereux (France), Eemsmond, Makkum, Uithuizermeeden (Netherlands), Waasmunster (Belgium), and Westerdeichstrich (Germany). The city of Norfolk, Virginia also uses a mermaid as a symbol. The personal coat of arms of Michaëlle Jean, former Governor General of Canada, features two mermaids as supporters.

== Fandom ==
Interest in mermaid costuming has grown with the popularity of fantasy cosplay, as well as the availability of inexpensive monofins used in the construction of these costumes. The costumes are typically designed to be used while swimming, in an activity known as mermaiding. Mermaid fandom conventions have also been held.

<doc id="76593" wikidata="Q1935194" url="?curid=76593" title="Wolfman Jack">
<text>Robert Weston Smith (January 21, 1938July 1, 1995), known as Wolfman Jack, was an American disc jockey active for over three decades. Famous for the gravelly voice which he credited for his success, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s kept meat and potatoes on the table for years for Wolfman and Wolfwoman. A couple of shots of whiskey helps it. I&#x27;ve got that nice raspy sound.&quot;

==Early life==

Smith was born in Brooklyn, New York City, on January 21, 1938, the younger of two children of Anson Weston Smith, an Episcopal Sunday school teacher, writer, editor, and executive vice president of &quot;Financial World&quot;, and his wife, Rosamond Small. He lived on 12th Street and 4th Avenue and went to Manual Training High School in the Park Slope section. His parents divorced while he was a child. To help keep him out of trouble, his father bought him a large Trans-Oceanic radio, and Smith became an avid fan of R&amp;B music and the disc jockeys who played it, including Douglas &quot;Jocko&quot; Henderson of Philadelphia; New York&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jive&quot; (Tommy Smalls); the &quot;Moon Dog&quot; from Cleveland, Alan Freed; and Nashville&#x27;s &quot;John R.&quot; Richbourg, who later became his mentor. After selling encyclopedias and Fuller brushes door-to-door, Smith attended the National Academy of Broadcasting in Washington, D.C.

== Broadcasting career ==
After graduating from NAB in 1960, Smith began working as &quot;Daddy Jules&quot; at WYOU in Newport News, Virginia. When the station format changed to &quot;beautiful music&quot;, he became known as &quot;Roger Gordon and Music in Good Taste&quot;. In 1962, Smith moved to country music station KCIJ/1050 in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the station manager and morning disc jockey, &quot;Big Smith with the Records&quot;. He married Lucy &quot;Lou&quot; Lamb in 1961, and they had two children.

Cleveland&#x27;s Alan Freed had originally called himself the &quot;Moon Dog&quot; after New York City street musician Moondog. Freed both adopted this name and used a recorded howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character. Smith&#x27;s adaptation of the Moondog theme was to call himself Wolfman Jack and add his own sound effects. The character was based in part on the manner and style of bluesman Howlin&#x27; Wolf. At KCIJ, he first began to develop his famous alter ego, Wolfman Jack. According to author Philip A. Lieberman, Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wolfman&quot; persona &quot;derived from Smith&#x27;s love of horror films and his shenanigans as a &#x27;wolfman&#x27; with his two young nephews. The &#x27;Jack&#x27; nickname was taken from the &#x27;hipster&#x27; lingo of the 1950s, as in &#x27;Take a page from my book, Jack&#x27;, or the more popular, &#x27;Hit the road, Jack.&#x27;&quot;

In 1963, Smith took his act to the border when Inter-American Radio Advertising&#x27;s Ramon Bosquez hired him and sent him to the studio and transmitter site of XERF-AM at Ciudad Acuña in Mexico, a station across the U.S.-Mexico border from Del Rio, Texas, whose high-powered border blaster signal could be picked up across much of the United States. In an interview with writer Tom Miller, Smith described the reach of the XERF signal: &quot;We had the most powerful signal in North America. Birds dropped dead when they flew too close to the tower. A car driving from New York to L.A. would never lose the station.&quot;

Many of the Mexican border stations broadcast at 150,000 watts, three times the U.S. limit, meaning that their signals were picked up all over North America, and at night as far away as Europe and the Soviet Union. At XERF, Smith developed his signature style (with phrases such as, &quot;Who&#x27;s this on the Wolfman telephone?&quot;) and widespread fame. The border stations made money by renting time to Pentecostal preachers and psychics, and by taking 50% of the profit from anything sold by mail order. The Wolfman did pitches for dog food, weight-loss pills, weight-gain pills, rose bushes, and baby chicks. Even a pill called Florex, which was supposed to enhance one&#x27;s sex drive, was sold. &quot;Some zing for your ling nuts&quot;, the Wolfman would say.

XERB was the original call sign for the border blaster station in Rosarito Beach, Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in Hollywood, California. The station boasted &quot;50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power&quot;. That station continues to broadcast under the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small strip mall on Third Avenue in Chula Vista, California just 10 minutes from the Tijuana–San Diego border crossing. The Wolfman was rumored to actually broadcast from this location during the early to mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to Minneapolis to run station KUXL. Although Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station.

Missing the excitement, however, Wolfman returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles in January 1966. He recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be beamed across the U.S.

In 1971, the Mexican government, under pressure from the Roman Catholic church, banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80% of XERB&#x27;s revenue. Smith then moved to station KDAY 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. Smith capitalized on his fame, though, by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock-and-roll syndicated programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually marketed to oldies stations). He also appeared on Armed Forces Radio from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries. He was heard as far afield as the Wild Coast, Transkei, on Capital Radio 604 based there.

In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, the Wolfman was paid handsomely to join WNBC in New York in August 1973, the same month that &quot;American Graffiti&quot; premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers predicting the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, WABC&#x27;s Cousin Brucie (Bruce Morrow). The advertisements proclaimed, &quot;Cousin Brucie&#x27;s Days Are Numbered / Wolfman Jack Is on the Prowl&quot;, and thousands of small, tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, &quot;Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack&quot;.

After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984 to 1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family. In the 1980s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border-blaster station that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. He also hosted a TV show at Little Darlin&#x27;s Rock n&#x27; Roll Palace, which was eventually renamed Wolfman Jack&#x27;s Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Palace. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.

Recordings of Wolfman Jack&#x27;s old shows were reintroduced to syndication a decade after his death and remain available to local stations, through Talent Farm as of mid-2020. In 2024, as part of a oldies format marking its 85th anniversary, XEPRS began to carry the remastered recordings.

==Film, television, and music career==
In his early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a master of ceremonies for rock bands at Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance, he looked a little different because he had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee, but sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat &quot;ethnic.&quot; Other times he had a big afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. His audience finally got a good look at him when he appeared in the 1969 film &quot;A Session with the Committee&quot;, a montage of skits by the comedy troupe The Committee.

Wolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett, who helped record the album &quot;Boogie with the Wolfman&quot; by Wolfman Jack and the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. He was also responsible for engineering, producing, and assembling the band. Wolfman Jack also released &quot;Wolfman Jack&quot; (1972) and &quot;Through the Ages&quot; (1973) on the Wooden Nickel label.

In 1973, he appeared as himself in George Lucas&#x27;s second feature film &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. Lucas gave him a fraction of a &quot;point&quot;, the division of the profits from a film, and the extreme financial success of &quot;American Graffiti&quot; provided him with a regular income for life. He also appeared in the film&#x27;s 1979 sequel &quot;More American Graffiti&quot;, though only through voice-overs. In 1978, he appeared as Bob &quot;The Jackal&quot; Smith in a made-for-TV movie &quot;Deadman&#x27;s Curve&quot; based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence of Jan and Dean. Smith appeared in several television shows as Wolfman Jack, including &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (his final public performance), &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;The New Adventures of Wonder Woman&quot;, and &quot;Galactica 1980&quot;. He was the regular announcer and occasional host for &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; on NBC from 1973 to 1981. He was the host of his variety series &quot;The Wolfman Jack Show&quot;, which was produced in Canada by CBC Television in 1976 and syndicated to stations in the U.S. In 1984, Wolfman Jack starred as himself on the short-lived ABC animated series &quot;Wolf Rock TV&quot;. He also voiced the chief of the Rama Lama tribe on the TV special &quot;Garfield in Paradise&quot; in 1986.

Jim Morrison&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)&quot; were influenced by Wolfman Jack&#x27;s broadcasting. His characteristic voice is imitated by disc jockey Ken Griffin on Sugarloaf&#x27;s 1974 hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Us, We&#x27;ll Call You&quot; and he is mentioned on the Grateful Dead song &quot;Ramble On Rose&quot;. He furnished his voice in The Guess Who&#x27;s top-10 hit single &quot;Clap for the Wolfman&quot;. In 1976, he furnished his voice on &quot;Did You Boogie (With Your Baby)&quot; by Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids. Wolfman Jack was regularly parodied on &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot; as &quot;The Wolfman,&quot; an actual werewolf disc jockey with a look inspired by the original &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; movies. A few years earlier, Todd Rundgren recorded the tribute &quot;Wolfman Jack&quot; on the album &quot;Something/Anything?&quot;; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over introduction by the Wolfman, but on the album version, Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band The Stampeders also released a cover of &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot; in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack. From 1975 to 1980, Wolfman Jack hosted Halloween Haunt at Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm, which transforms itself into Knott&#x27;s Scary Farm each year for Halloween. It was the most successful special event of any theme park in the country, and often sold out.

In 2012, the estate of Wolfman Jack released a hip-hop single featuring Wolfman Jack clips as the vocals. In 2016, clips from the Wolfman Jack Radio Program were used in the Rob Zombie film &quot;31&quot;.

==Radio Caroline==
When the one surviving ship in what had originally been a pirate radio network of Radio Caroline North and Radio Caroline South sank in 1980, a search began to find a replacement. Because of new laws passed in the UK in 1967 (Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967), the sales operation needed to be situated outside of the UK. For a time, Don Kelley, Wolfman Jack&#x27;s business partner and personal manager, acted as the West Coast agent for the planned new Radio Caroline, but the deal eventually fell apart.

As a part of this process, Wolfman Jack was set to deliver the morning shows on the new station. To that end, he recorded a number of programs that never aired, because the station did not come on air according to schedule. (It eventually returned in 1983 from a new ship, which remained at sea until 1990.) Today, those tapes are traded among collectors of his work.

==Death==
On July 1, 1995, Smith died from a heart attack at his house in Belvidere, North Carolina, shortly after finishing a weekly broadcast. He was 57 years old. He is buried at a family cemetery in Belvidere.

==Legacy and portrayals==

<text>Theodore H. Osborne (February 6, 1900 – March 12, 1968) was an American writer of comics, radio shows and animated films, remembered for his contributions to the creation and refinement, during the 1930s, of Walt Disney cartoon characters.

==Biography==
Ted Osborne was born in Oklahoma. He spent 1931–1940 at the Walt Disney Studio as a story writer and also wrote for several of the Disney comic strips.

Osborne, a writer for Los Angeles radio station KHJ, was hired by Disney in October 1931 to develop a Mickey Mouse radio show. That project never materialized, and Osborne moved to the studio&#x27;s Story Department.

In 1933, Osborne moved from Story to the comic strip department, to work with artist Floyd Gottfredson on the popular &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip. Gottfredson drew the strip and wrote the plots; Osborne broke the plots down into strips and wrote the dialogue.

Osborne&#x27;s first Sunday &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; strip was published on January 29, 1933, starting the story &quot;Lair of Wolf Barker.&quot; He took over the daily strip as of February 11, with the story &quot;Pluto and the Dogcatcher&quot;. Osborne scripted many memorable &quot;Mickey&quot; stories from 1933 to 1937 which were later adapted into the popular Big Little Books of the 1930s and 1940s, including &quot;The Mail Pilot&quot;, &quot;Editor-in-Grief&quot;, &quot;Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion&quot;, &quot;The Seven Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Monarch of Medioka&quot;.

In April 1933, Earl Duvall, who had been writing and drawing the &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday comic strip for Disney, abruptly left the company, leaving the strip without a writer. Osborne stepped in and continued the strip, working with artist Al Taliaferro. The pair wrote a number of adaptations of &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; animated shorts, including 1934&#x27;s &quot;The Wise Little Hen&quot; and 1936&#x27;s &quot;Three Little Wolves&quot;.

In 1936, Taliaferro was allowed to use &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; as a tryout for a solo comic strip featuring Donald Duck, with Osborne as writer. The series ran for more than a year, from August 30, 1936 to December 5, 1937. In October 1937, Osborne and Taliaferro introduced Donald&#x27;s triplet nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie, for a six-week story. The irrepressible youngsters made such a hit in the comics page that they were introduced in a 1938 cartoon short, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Nephews&quot;, and became a crucial part of Donald&#x27;s supporting cast.

Taliaferro was given the green light to create a solo &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic strip in 1938, but by that point, Osborne had left the comic strip department. In late 1937, Osborne was moved back to the Story Department to work on &quot;Bambi&quot;, a feature film project that was ultimately released in 1942. His last &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; strip ran on Sunday, December 5, 1937; his last &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; daily was published on February 5, 1938; and his last &quot;Mickey&quot; Sunday ran on March 11, 1938.

He was succeeded by writer Merrill De Maris on both &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; and &quot;Silly Symphony&quot;. When his &quot;Bambi&quot; team disbanded in 1940, Gottfredson chose to keep De Maris as his permanent writer, and Osborne left the Disney studio.

After leaving the studio, Osborne managed a photographic studio in Hollywood. He died in San Carlos, California on March 12, 1968.

<text>Finland is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. It was a relative latecomer to industrialization, remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s. It rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an extensive Nordic-style welfare state, resulting in widespread prosperity and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. However, Finnish GDP growth was negative in 2012–2014 (−0.698% to −1.426%), with a preceding nadir of −8% in 2009. Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development.

<text>XHRF-FM () and XERF-AM () are radio stations in Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila, Mexico. Originally only on the AM band, XERF is a Mexican Class A clear-channel station transmitting with of power. Now branded as &quot;La Poderosa&quot;, XHRF-FM and XERF-AM simulcast their programming and are owned by the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio (IMER), a Mexican public broadcaster.

In earlier times, XERF was operated under the laws of Mexico by Ramón D. Bósquez and Arturo González, transmitting as a border blaster, featuring famed disc jockey Wolfman Jack. XERF received its concession on , and commenced operations, using the old facilities of John R. Brinkley&#x27;s XERA, which ceased broadcasting in . XERF was not a continuation of XERA.

==Cross-national operation (19491986)==
The facilities of the old border blaster XERA, which had been created by John R. Brinkley, were confiscated by the Mexican government in , and Villa Acuña did not have another high-power station until , when the Compañía Radiodifusora de Coahuila, S.A., headed by Ramón D. Bósquez and Arturo González, signed XERF-AM on the air on . The station used XERA&#x27;s old transmission site, with a power of (later increased to ); its first day of broadcasting included a formal opening featuring programs from the chambers of commerce of both Villa Acuña and Del Rio, Texas and the presence of the Bishop of Saltillo. For many years, the station made money by selling its time after nightfall to American evangelists who broadcast in English to the United States.

===The border blaster===
Prior to , XERF retained the Wilson and Howard Radio Advertising Agency to handle its United States ad sales. In that year, Bósquez and González formed a Texas corporation called Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc. which was located on Pecan Street in Del Rio, Texas. While XERF&#x27;s concession remained with Compañía Radiodifusora de Coahuila, the actual control of the airtime and the management of the facilities in Ciudad Acuña were under the control of Inter-American Radio Advertising.

The Texas company purchased a RCA transmitter to broadcast an omni-directional clear channel signal on AM 1570, which originated some distance from the old XERA facilities within three new prefabricated concrete buildings with flat roofs. The sales brochure for XERF offered this explanation about the operation of the station (emphasis and wording shown as in the original text):
There is, of course, one BIG difference between U.S. and Mexican Stations, and that is a matter of POWER; American Stations are limited a maximum ... a limitation that does not exist under Mexican regulation. X.E.R.F. for example, is licensed to operate on power, and the Department of Communication and Public Works of the Mexican Government has authorized a power increase to . Such power could result in serious interference if wave lengths were not strictly maintained, but the equipment with which X.E.R.F., operates assures its signal to stay &quot;right on the beam.&quot; This is something constantly checked by FCC monitor stations, a degree of regulation by the U.S. Government alike that is imposed upon U.S. Stations. Operating on a clear channel, X.E.R.F. is heard nightly in all parts of the fifty States in the United States, Canada and Latin-America.

Although reference was made to a power increase, the station only had an RCA transmitter.

===Paul Kallinger===
The booming bass voice of Paul Kallinger was used to sell many of the products on XERF. At night, his recorded spots between the different sponsored shows served as a jingle break. Kallinger remained on the Texas side of the border and recorded his spots at a studio in Del Rio, because he did not want to become embroiled with the lawlessness that swirled around the XERF studio and transmitter on the other side of the border. In between the different religious programs, Kallinger would tell XERF listeners in various versions that:

It’s always good to know that we have some fine people out there listening to the most powerful commercial voice in the world ... From alongside the beautiful Rio Grande, this is XERF, Ciudad Acuña, Coahuila, Mexico. Our mailing address is Del Rio, Texas. This is Paul Kallinger.

As Mexican law required stations to identify in Spanish, the portion identifying the station&#x27;s call letters and the station&#x27;s location in Mexico, was then repeated in that language.

Kallinger, along with fellow XERF alumni Bill Mack, were inducted into the Texas Country Music Disc Jockey Hall of Fame in in recognition of their influence on the development of country music.

===Wolfman Jack (19621964)===
With the birth of rock and roll and its promotion by disc jockeys such as Alan Freed, a new interest was taken in the unrestricted superpower airwaves that were available in Mexico. Alan Freed had originally called himself the &quot;Moondog&quot; after hearing the name used by an experimental street musician in New York City. Freed not only adopted the name but used the recording of a howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character since he was featuring African-American music that was getting a great reception from America&#x27;s White teenagers.

One of Freed&#x27;s fans was Bob Smith, a disc jockey who also adopted the &quot;Moondog&quot; theme by calling himself Wolfman Jack and adding his own sound effects. Smith took his act to Inter-American Radio Advertising, who sent him to the studio and transmitter site of XERF. It was here that Wolfman Jack invented his own style of border blasting by turning the airwaves into one long infomercial featuring music and off-the-wall products.

Wolfman Jack gained a huge audience which brought in enough money to not only pay the bills, but to cause bandits and corrupt officials to also take enough interest in taking over his promotions for themselves. As a result, Smith began to pay his own security force to protect him, because although he lived in Del Rio, Texas, because of the Brinkley Act he had to actually broadcast from the station itself in Ciudad Acuña in Mexico.

===Lawlessness and death===
In , XERF returned to the headlines when armed men seized the station. Mexican authorities intervened, stationing federal troops to guard the station. In testimony, employees said they were chased, and that one armed man threatened Kallinger with a .45 pistol. After a legal dispute, a judge found in favor of Saúl Montes, the station&#x27;s administrator, who put the station back on the air. In , a gun battle at the station left a 50-year-old man dead; his body was found on an adjoining ranch. Station personnel broadcast panicked pleas for help, prompting local residents to notify the authorities.

After the second gun battle, Bob Smith decided to leave for XERB, a border blaster in Tijuana and listenable in Los Angeles, California. It was this station that George Lucas featured in the movie &quot;American Graffiti&quot;.

Meanwhile, XERF reverted to selling time according to the old format devised by Dr. Brinkley. It featured paid programming, most of it from American fringe evangelists, right-wing political groups and Black Nationalist messages from the Nation of Islam. In , a pastor sued the station for removing him from its air, alleging that the contract he had signed was for the duration of its broadcast concession. In the early , the station faced another lawsuit over contracts for airtime on XERF.

In early , station employees who had been seeking back wages for 13 years, since the gunfight, won a victory in Mexican court, and Montes was appointed the sole administrator of XERF.

With the advent of FM stereo radio broadcasting, interest in the static-prone mono AM signals of XERF began to wane and its signal was switched from the RCA transmitter, which was never paid for and which consistently kept breaking down, to a new transmitter. Its program schedule consisted of primarily religious shows, and it did not broadcast during the day.

==Brief rebirth in the ==
In , Bob Smith (Wolfman Jack) ran into a radio engineer friend named Mike Venditti, and he told Venditti that no one had been able to get XERF back on full power with its old RCA transmitter, because RCA did not have any manuals relating to the equipment. Venditti then approached González with a business proposition.

===Love 16===
In exchange for restoring the main RCA transmitter to active duty, Venditti asked González to lease him the daytime hours from to . Because the station was only operating on a fraction of power from the transmitter, XERF was not on the air during the day. At night, XERF reverted to its sponsored format of mainly American religious programs.

Venditti succeeded in getting the old transmitter to work, and at first, his new station &quot;Love 16&quot; (a name taken from the 1570 AM frequency) broadcast an English language format composed of a mixture of soft rock, oldies, middle-of-the-road, country, and Big Band music, along with hourly ABC News newscasts. This format did not sell and soon &quot;Love 16&quot; was programming a modern Christian music format. That did not work either.

Michael Venditti was a member of The Word Outreach Center, a Non-Denominational Church in Del Rio during this time. The church was pastored by Michael Kyle, a native of Del Rio and longtime broadcaster himself, having worked in both local radio stations and with Paul Kallinger. Michael Kyle worked an air shift at the station in Mexico when the format went to all music.

Before Venditti pulled the plug on Love 16, it attracted a lot of publicity in the Texas press concerning the rebirth of XERF as a real border blaster.

===Texas Night Train===
Another group from the Dallas and Fort Worth area then replaced Bill Mack with a nightly taped program called the &quot;Texas Night Train&quot;. Because the marathon shows which featured every type of popular music and comedy were taped, there was no problem with a lack of live landline connections. Weekend editions were also heard on some U.S. radio stations in Texas, including KXOL, an AM station in Fort Worth.

The show took telephone requests which were then mixed into the following-night program tape. Its big feature was the voice of the DJ, who was identified as the &quot;Night Hawk&quot;, but who some mistook as a voice clone of Wolfman Jack. He was heralded over the sound effects of a massive steam train which gave the impression the &quot;Texas Night Train&quot; was chugging its way across Texas.

===Wonderful Radio London===
Another group that was also based in North Texas who were aware of the Bill Mack venture on XERF and the replacement of his time slot by the &quot;Texas Night Train&quot; were the owners of a company attempting to revive the British offshore station Wonderful Radio London. Headed by Ben Toney, who had been the original program manager for &quot;Big L&quot; in the , the new company also had links to Don Pierson who had founded the station in . Ben Toney and his business associate went to Del Rio and met with attorney Arturo González in his law office, which he shared with Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc.

Arturo González was of Mexican heritage and a U.S. citizen. He held an exclusive contractual arrangement with XERF&#x27;s silent concession holders across the Rio Grande in Mexico. Arturo González was able to enforce his own contract with the concessionaire because his Inter-American Radio Advertising, Inc., held the purse strings to all of the money paid by American advertisers for airtime on XERF.

Built into the costs of operation were not only the expenses incurred from the electrical bills and basic engineering help, but from payments for the physical security of the station as well as the attorney&#x27;s own profit margin. Little, if anything, was ever spent on studio, transmitter or tower equipment.

After concluding the arrangement with Arturo González in Del Rio, Ben Toney and his associate then drove across the Rio Grande and on to the dirt roads and through the shacks that led to the small antiquated studio and barn that housed the facilities of radio station XERF. It appeared that, with the new interest being shown in the station from Texas, it would be possible to restore the signal of the station to a dependable high-power strength using the old RCA transmitter.

Beginning on , the &quot;Wonderful Radio London Top 40 Show&quot; was heard nightly via taped programs which were recorded in England and flown to Texas. In British music was once again &quot;invading&quot; the US charts in a major way, just as it had in the . However, the U.S. charts were about 12 months behind the British music charts, and so &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; positioned itself as playing &quot;tomorrow’s hits today&quot;. To accommodate the new schedule, the &quot;Texas Night Train&quot; was pushed back to allow the &quot;Big L&quot; show to serve as its lead-in beginning at midnight Texas time. Omnibus weekend editions of the &quot;Big L&quot; program were also heard on several US radio stations, including KXOL in Fort Worth.

The first of the daily &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; shows that were broadcast by XERF was introduced by the voice of John Lennon who was asked in what he thought about American commercial radio. On the second night, which was the anniversary of the close-down of the original &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; on , airchecks were played beginning with the last Breakfast Show that had been broadcast. The program for began with a record dedicated to Ben Toney in , who then cut in on the program to thank the DJ that he had personally hired 30 years earlier. This dedication was followed by the voices of Mick Jagger, Ringo Starr and many others all bidding the station farewell. The theme of the show was The Beatles’ &quot;You say goodbye and we say hello&quot; announcing the new programming that would begin the following night on .

===Constant transmitter problems===
No sooner had the &quot;Wonderful Radio London Top 40 Show&quot; started when the &quot;Texas Night Train&quot; folded. Its demise was due to the same problem that Bill Mack had encountered. The &quot;Texas Night Train&quot; often disappeared into the static of the AM band when the XERF transmitter power dropped off. Advertisers would not buy time, and with mounting debts, the &quot;Texas Night Train&quot; came to the end of its line. Linking the owners of the &quot;Texas Night Train&quot; and &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; programs was KXOL in Fort Worth where both shows were also aired on weekends. KXOL was in the process of being sold, and Harold Glen Martin, who later returned to work at KXOL, was at that time the only live on-air personality at XERF. Using a &quot;hillbilly&quot; accent under the name of &quot;Billy Purl&quot;, he presented a live country music program to fill the dead air on XERF. Martin claims the honor of being the last live voice heard on XERF. Billy Purl&#x27;s gold lamé XERF jacket is part of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s border radio collection in Cleveland, Ohio.

===Final proposition===
To mark the exact date of its original start-up, &quot;Wonderful Radio London International&quot; (WRLI) was planning its own return as a full-time radio station broadcasting from off the coast of England beginning in . (This was during the period in which both Radio Caroline and Laser 558 were broadcasting successfully from ships off the British coast, though not without harassment from the authorities.) After the demise of &quot;The Texas Night Train&quot; marathon program, the WRLI team approached attorney Arturo González in Del Rio with a new proposal. Since XERF reception reports had been received from Europe when the power was maintained at , it was proposed that &quot;Wonderful Radio London&quot; would take over the entirety of the hours after midnight Central Time. This would correspond to . Under the joint call sign of &quot;Wonderful Radio London via XERF&quot; and operating as a full-service station at full power, &quot;Big L&quot; would be able to attract both the additional funding and advertising necessary to also make the new offshore project into a commercial success.

==How commercial XERF faded away==
However, time had run out for the superpower XERF when attorney Arturo González was forced to retire. His own age and the additional questionable legalities, among other things, of brokering a contract that would involve yet another country (the UK), would become more of a headache than he wanted at his time of life. Without his Texas sales connection, the silent owners of the ancient transmitter facilities also knew that the days of XERF were finally over.

When Arturo González was forced out of the picture due to corruption and alleged fraudulent issues, the Mexicans were left with out-of-date broadcasting facilities and a market that wanted both FM stereo and MTV on cable television. By this time the preachers had also drifted to cable outlets such as Jim Bakker’s PTL and Pat Robertson’s CBN cable television networks.

Additionally, regulatory changes on both sides of the border presented a grim panorama. On the American side, a new international radio agreement would diminish the coverage area of Mexican clear-channel stations by allowing American stations to set up shop on those frequencies; meanwhile, Mexico proposed changes to its broadcast law that would allow for operators to own their stations for 10 years, at which time the government would have the right to purchase a station for the depreciated value of its assets.

==XERF under IMER==

However, one Mexican group was highly interested in taking control of XERF for itself. In , the federal government created the Instituto Mexicano de la Radio (IMER, ), which initially owned all of the radio stations which the government had come into owning through other agencies. Given XERF&#x27;s geographic location, transmitter power, and status on a clear channel, the Mexican government considered XERF of strategic importance to acquire.

On , IMER purchased the assets of Compañía Radiodifusora de Coahuila, S.A. and immediately took over operations of XERF. Five days later, in a special shareholders&#x27; meeting, Compañía Radiodifusora de Coahuila voted to dissolve itself. The concession was formally transferred to IMER on . However, once IMER acquired XERF, it was left with the old, broken transmitter, for which there were no parts, and a second, transmitter, which was also having problems, and XERF operated with only .

In , IMER began a modernization project nationwide. Special attention was paid to XERF, where IMER launched &quot;Proyecto Ciudad Acuña&quot; to improve the station&#x27;s technical facilities and strengthen its vision for XERF. With the acquisition of a new transmitter, XERF raised its power to in . On , President Vicente Fox formally dedicated XERF&#x27;s new facilities.

The goal of XERF under IMER is to provide a broadcast service that links migrating Mexicans to their original communities. The station&#x27;s programming consists of news/talk programs and Mexican popular music.

===AMFM migration===
As part of the Mexican government plan to move as many AM stations as possible to the FM band, XHRF-FM signed on . The station, however, could not turn off its AM transmitter because doing so would leave a total of 404 people in 37 localities without any radio service whatsoever, resulting in the declaration of a continuity obligation that remains until some other radio service is provided to those 404 people.

===HD Radio broadcast and programming===
XHRF began broadcasts in HD Radio on October 28, 2012. The HD2 stream relays XHOF-FM &quot;Reactor&quot;, while HD3 features XHIMER-FM &quot;Opus&quot;, both IMER stations in Mexico City.

<text>Richard Timothy Kinney (December 15, 1916, Utah – March 24, 1985, Glendale, California) was an American animator and comic book writer. His comic book work was mostly in Disney comics, writing stories featuring Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck. He was the writer who, along with artist Al Hubbard, created Fethry Duck and Hard Haid Moe. Kinney is the younger brother of fellow Disney animator Jack Kinney.

Earlier, as an animation writer, Kinney was part of the story crew on various Disney, Walter Lantz Productions, UPA, Paramount Cartoon Studios and Jack Kinney Productions/King Features Syndicate theatrical and TV cartoons. The Lantz cartoon &quot;Niagara Fools&quot;, featuring Woody Woodpecker, represented perhaps Kinney&#x27;s most fondly-remembered original storyline. Later, Kinney would remake the story for comics with Fethry Duck in, essentially, the Woody role.

== Legacy ==
Rotten Tomatoes presents him as follows &quot;While some animators from the golden age of Hollywood studio cartoons have gained renown, few story men have been hailed for their achievements. Dick Kinney is a significant figure in this unsung field. He is best known for his work at the Walt Disney Studio with his brother, animation director Jack Kinney, on the highly regarded series of Goofy sports cartoons made during the 1940s.&quot;

<text>The Beagle Boys are a group of cartoon characters created in 1951 by Carl Barks for the Donald Duck universe. They are a family clan of organized criminals who constantly try to rob Scrooge McDuck. Their introduction and first appearance was in &quot;Terror of the Beagle Boys&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; No. 134, November 1951), although in this story they only appear in the last frame and have no lines. They appear again in the next issue in a similar fashion, in &quot;The Big Bin on Killmotor Hill&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; No. 135, December 1951).

==The Beagle Boys in comics==
===Barks/Rosa universe===
The Beagle Boys were originally created by Carl Barks and made their first appearance in the 10-page story &quot;The Terror of the Beagle Boys&quot; (WDC #134) that was first published in November 1951. Although the Beagle Boys are only shown very briefly on the last page of this story, it is implied that Scrooge has known about them for a long time. The Beagle Boys are usually depicted as a gang of about three to ten members or more depending on the story, who are identical in appearance and personality. They wear black bandit masks to hide their identities and on their turtleneck sweaters, most often being orange or red, they have their prison number signs. The Beagle Boys are often characterized to be very crude, boastful, aggravating, greedy, and self-centered – among themselves, however, they are very loyal and have a strong connection of sibling camaraderie. Although, on some occasions, they have shown irritation toward each other, often relating to someone making a mistake or saying something that does not fit in with the consensus, like one Beagle Boy&#x27;s (176–167) overly fondness of prunes; a weakness that proves to be the Beagle Boys&#x27; downfall in some stories. 176-167&#x27;s love for prunes makes him the only Beagle Boy with a unique characteristic.

The first story to feature the Beagle Boys in a major role is &quot;Only a Poor Old Man&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; No. 1, March 1952), which serves as a template for virtually all future Beagle Boys appearances, and establishes them as a serious threat to Scrooge&#x27;s fortune. In the same story, they are called &quot;the most awful gang of crooks in the country&quot; by Donald Duck. This most often manifests with them cleverly coming up with various or elaborate schemes to try to break into and steal from Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s well-secured Money Bin. On occasion they are even shown to have highly intellectual capacities, as they are able to earn academic degrees in various fields. Among individual Beagle Boys, some of these degrees include: cranial encephalography, psychology, chemistry, metallurgy, and electropyrotechnology. These were often seen by the government as attempts at rehabilitation, but in reality, it was a charade by the Beagle Boys to use their newly acquired skills for robberies. They are also experts at trickery, including disguises, and animal training; like using cormorants as aerial bombers, as well as having a large arsenal of various weapons, explosives, or machines. When needed, they have been shown to be able to use force or threats to get what they want. With all things considered, however, the Beagle Boys are often attributed not to be as clever as they think they are, often gullible to tricks and offensives themselves. Also, most of their appearances ends with them getting arrested. They are usually imprisoned in Duckburg prisons or Sing Sing, but they have also been jailed in other prisons as well. The Beagle Boys are however proud of their criminal background; never willing to live their lives in accordance to the law.

The Beagle Boys&#x27; main goal for stealing Scrooge McDuck&#x27;s money is so they can create a paradisiacal life of luxury for themselves. On few occasions when they have managed to steal the money, they are shown to spend it all very wastefully and in excess; like buying extravagant and ostentatious mansions or living on a paradise island near Hawaii. They have also shown proneness for taking over the world when being presented with such an opportunity, like in Carl Barks&#x27; story &quot;The Mysterious Stone Ray&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; No. 8, 1954).
The Beagle Boys are most often shown without an established leader, instead acting as a very coherent and homogeneous unit, and only giving orders between each other interchangeably when needed. However, sometimes the Beagle Boys are led by their grandfather, Blackheart Beagle, who has the prison number 186–802. The Blackheart character originates from two characters created by Carl Barks: Blackheart Beagle, a riverboat pirate from &quot;The Fantastic River Race&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge goes to Disneyland&quot; #1, 1957), and Grandpa Beagle, who appeared in &quot;The Money Well&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; #21, 1958). It was Don Rosa who later combined the character into one in chapters 10 and 11 of &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;. Also, according to Rosa, Blackheart Beagle semi-retired in 1947, following a failed attempt at robbing Scrooge&#x27;s Money Bin. In &quot;The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck&quot;, Scrooge first met The Beagle Boys in his Mississippi riverboat days, circa 1880. Those Beagle Boys included Blackheart Beagle and his three sons.

Scrooge first met the modern third-generation Beagle Boys during Christmas 1947, which was when he first met his three grandnephews, along with his nephew Donald Duck for the second time. Since then, the Beagle Boys have been a constant threat to Scrooge&#x27;s Money Bin.
The third generation of the Beagle Boys, like their fathers, were never given any personal names by Carl Barks but was instead referred to by their prison numbers, which starts with &quot;176-&quot; and ends on a permutation of the numbers 1, 6, and 7, which allows six different combinations. This tradition was first established in Barks&#x27; &quot;The Menehune Mystery&quot; (Uncle Scrooge No. 4, December 1953), while the Beagle Boys in previous stories, and some of them in &quot;The Menehune Mystery&quot;, instead had their prison numbers as &quot;176-&quot; followed by random digits (except in their first story, where they have no prison numbers). However, in a few of his later stories, Barks did not continue this tradition and used random numbers again instead. But subsequent writers and artists by default still mostly uses the 1, 6, and 7 combinations for the Beagle Boys in the modern comic books. The Beagle Boys also have their prison numbers tattooed on their chests. According to Don Rosa&#x27;s &quot;The Beagle Boys vs. The Money Bin&quot; (2001), the Beagle Boys have been known by their prison numbers since their childhood, and they do not even know their real names themselves. Their parents do know their real names, but demand a bribe from their sons to let them know. Also according to that story, Blackheart Beagle does not remember his sons&#x27; names.

Carl Barks used to include the words &quot;Beagle Boys, Inc.&quot; on their shirts under their numbers, which was later deleted in reprints. It can either be assumed that this was a reference to Murder, Inc., a name for organized crime groups in the 1930s and 40s; or that they are a criminal organization very similar to a real business, but neither is certain. In one comic, the Beagle Boys have a worldwide organization known as Beagles International, in which the Beagles have spies in different countries around the world.

In most of Carl Barks stories, the number of Beagle Boys was not exact but instead they were depicted as being ambiguously numerous, with their number of members varying from story to story. However, if one would count all of the different combinations of the Beagle Boys&#x27; prison numbers that was used in the comic books by Carl Barks, the Beagle Boys would seem to consist of at least 36 members. In &quot;The Menehune Mystery&quot;, Scrooge mentions thirty Beagle Boys. Don Rosa, however, constantly uses seven Beagle Boys in his stories, but instead of using a random number Rosa always hides one prison numbers behind something to avoid two Beagle Boys having the same number.

The Beagle Boys usually operate on their own, but collaborated with Magica De Spell in the 1963 Barks story &quot;Isle of the Golden Geese&quot;, and again in the 1997 Don Rosa story &quot;A Little Something Special&quot; where they also teamed up with Flintheart Glomgold. In &quot;The Status Seeker&quot; (&quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; No. 41, 1963) by Carl Barks, they are shown to be part of a labor union called the &quot;Burglars, Thugs, and Pirates Union&quot;, at Local No. 61⁄2.

===Other comics===

From 1964 to 1979 the Beagle Boys had their own comic book title, &quot;The Beagle Boys&quot;, published by Gold Key Comics, which continued from 1979 to 1980 under the name &quot;The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge&quot;.

In all comics, the individual Beagle Boys are referred to by their prison numbers as per Barks&#x27;s convention. In addition to Barks&#x27;s and Rosa&#x27;s claim that the Beagle Boys do not know their names, the Beagle Boys-centric comic &quot;Being Donald Duck&quot; (2003) by Olaf Moriarty Solstrand adds that the Beagle Boys do not know their mother&#x27;s name either, only her number. The Beagle Boys&#x27; prison numbers are indicated on the tags seen on the chests of their distinctive orange or red turtleneck sweaters. The original depictions by Barks in American comics most often showed the Beagle Boys with orange sweaters. European comics recolored these same Barks drawings to show Beagle Boys in red sweaters. Subsequent European comic depictions of the Beagle Boys by artists other than Barks also showed them in red sweaters, as did the &quot;DuckTales&quot; cartoons.
In later years, especially in Europe, they appear in the comics as a trio, alongside cousins and other relatives of various talents as spin-off characters. Most notably are the Beagle Brats, the Beagle Boys&#x27; three preteen nephews created by Tony Strobl and Steve Steere in &quot;That Motherly Feeling&quot; (&quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; No. 299, 1965). They mirror criminal versions of Scrooge&#x27;s three nephews and have the prison numbers 1, 2, and 3. Another prominent relative is Intellectual-176 (or I-176, for short), the Beagle Boys&#x27; cousin who acts as the brains of the Beagle clan. He wears a mortar-board cap and glasses over his black bandit mask and has the prison number &quot;I-176&quot;. I-176 was created by Pete Alvarado and first appeared in &quot;The Crown Jewel Job&quot; (&quot;The Beagle Boys&quot; No. 7, 1967).

The Beagle Boys generally live in a small tumbledown hide-out in Duckburg; in 1970s American-produced stories, their pet cat Ratty often lived there as well. In the Italian stories, they live in a travel trailer and are sometimes accompanied by their pet dachshund, Ottoperotto, who shares their criminal mindset, but is often overcome with Ottoperotto&#x27;s constant, voracious appetite.

Sometimes they team up with other villains such as Magica De Spell, Black Pete, Mad Madam Mim, or hire out their services to Flintheart Glomgold, John D. Rockerduck, and Jolly Ollie Eiderduck. During these occasions, they continue to operate out of their own interests rather than their employers&#x27;.

Many other authors use a character purely based on &quot;The Money Well&quot; version as the Beagle Boys&#x27; grandfather. In particular, Italian authors use a &quot;Grandpa Beagle&quot; who differs from Blackheart in being much skinnier and constantly smoking a pipe. Unlike his grandsons, he is highly intelligent and appears as their cunning and capable leader, hatching devious plans. The Italian version of Grandpa Beagle has the word &quot;GRAZIA&quot; (which means &quot;pardon&quot; in Italian) where his prison number should be. When his stories are translated for the US, &quot;GRAZIA&quot; is replaced with &quot;186–802&quot;, his prison number in Western stories.

Sometimes the Beagle Boys antagonize Super Goof, Mickey Mouse, or some other characters from Walt Disney&#x27;s comic books.

===Ottoperotto===

Ottoperotto – univerbation of – is the Beagle Boys&#x27; pet dachshund in Italian comic book stories. The joke about him being a dachshund is that in Italy the Beagle Boys are referred to as &quot;Banda Bassotti&quot;, which means &quot;Dachshund Gang&quot;. Like his masters, Ottoperotto wears a bandit mask, a shirt, and a cap, marked with the number 64 (the result of the 8×8 multiplication). The Beagle Boys frequently take Ottoperotto along on their robberies, to act as a guard dog and to reach spaces too small for the Beagle Boys themselves. However, the plans are often spoiled by Ottoperotto&#x27;s constant, voracious appetite. Whenever Ottoperotto smells food, he abandons everything else to get to eat it.

==The Beagle Boys in animation==
===&quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot;===
The Beagle Boys made their animated debut in the 1987 television special &quot;Sport Goofy in Soccermania&quot;, voiced by Will Ryan. Similar to the comic books, the Beagle Boys are depicted as identical in both appearance and behavior, though lacking the prison numbers of their comic counterparts.

===&quot;DuckTales&quot;===

On &quot;DuckTales&quot;, the Beagle Boys were given names and different personalities and almost all of them speak in New York accents. The usual character combination is Bigtime, Burger, and either Bouncer or Baggy, with Bouncer appearing more often in the first season and Baggy in the second. Their leader is usually Bigtime when Ma Beagle is not present. Sometimes one or two of them were swapped out with Bankjob, Babyface, or Bugle, and a few episodes featured the latter three as the trio of Beagles, with Bankjob filling in for Bigtime as the leader. Other known names are Bomber and Blitzkrieg. The letter B is the first initial of all Beagle Boys&#x27; handles except Megabyte, the brains of the bunch.

The Beagle Boys have many relatives who count each other as brothers and cousins: apart from Ma Beagle, there are re-imagined versions of the Beagle Brats (sons or nephews), as well as the Beagle Babes (a female counterpart).

The Beagle Boys make cameos in the &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot; episode &quot;In Like Blunt&quot;, where they are among the villains bidding on a list of SHUSH&#x27;s secret agents.

====Ma Beagle====
Ma Beagle, based on the real-life Ma Barker and the mystifications around her, was a new character created for &quot;DuckTales&quot; as the mother of the seven common Beagle Boys featured on the show, and the clan matriarch. She often smuggles hand grenades, chainsaws, and other tools in baked goods which easily pass prison security to help her sons escape from jail. Even when she is around, the Beagles never succeed because Scrooge McDuck and his nephews always outwit them. However, in most of the episodes she appears in (especially in the first season), she is able to avoid being arrested along with her sons; that way, she will be able to bust them out the next time she appears. In one episode, she pretended to be &quot;married&quot; to Scrooge so that she could steal his fortune, but her plans were thwarted by both him and his three nephews. With Ma, family always comes first – except when it comes to avoiding arrest. She was voiced by actress June Foray, who also voiced Magica De Spell. Character actress Margo Martindale voices Ma in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series.

Ma Beagle first appeared in the episode &quot;Robot Robbers&quot;, and since then she has become a recurring character. She appeared more frequently in the second season than in the first, however.

====1987 Series Beagles====
There were many Beagle Boys on the 1987 original series, but the most common seven consisted of:
Other Beagle Boys consisted of:
* Megabyte Beagle is the most intelligent engineering genius of the clan, and the only one whose name does not begin with the letter &quot;B&quot;. He appeared in the five-part serial &quot;Super DuckTales&quot;, in which he made a remote control to control GizmoDuck. He has a habit of confusing his companions with his technobabble, forcing them to make him &quot;say it in Beagle talk!&quot;. Ma Beagle comments that paying his college fees with stolen money paid off. His voice was done by Frank Welker.
* Bomber Beagle looks a lot like Bankjob in that he has a similar jawline and is very large. He appears in some episodes and is more intelligent than most of the other brothers. He is also a skilled pilot as seen in the episode &quot;Top Duck&quot; (episode 16).
* Backwoods Beagle is a small beagle about the size of Bigtime and Babyface, and the only Beagle who wears a full mustache. He has a strong Canadian accent and is the twin brother of Binky Beagle and Bacon Beagle. Backwoods wears a Davy Crocket-like trapper&#x27;s outfit as opposed to the normal jailhouse outfit of the Beagle Boys. He is also the only person who is able to understand Bacon Beagle.
* Binky Beagle is probably the only Beagle Boy who is never seen speaking. He is roughly the same size as Baggy Beagle, wears a lumberjack outfit, and has a full beard. He lives with Backwoods and Bacon Beagle in the Ducky Mountains.
* Bacon Beagle is the only Beagle Boy who is not a Beagle. Bacon is in fact a pig. When Glomgold asked how he could be a Beagle Boy, Backwoods explains that Bacon had a bad case of the swine flu as a child. Bacon cannot speak, but his oinks and grunts are, instead, translated by Backwoods Beagle.
* Cameo Beagles:
** Bullseye Beagle
** Bulkhead Beagle
** Butterball Beagle
** Bombshell Beagle
** Bankroll Beagle
** Brainstorm Beagle
** Buns Beagle
** Boom Boom Beagle &quot;(Similar to the Beagle Babe)&quot;
** Banzai Beagle
** Buckaroo Beagle
** Beanball Beagle
** Blitzkrieg Beagle
** Bifocal Beagle
** Bumpkin Beagle
** Butter Ball Beagle
** Bully Beagle
** Bearnaise Beagle – A richer version of Burger
** Bicep Beagle – A richer version of Bouncer
** Bonaparte Beagle – A richer version of Bigtime

====2017 Series Beagles====
In the 2017 reboot series, the Beagle Boys are divided into several smaller gangs with Ma Beagle serving as the leader of all of them, as revealed in the episode &quot;The Beagle Birthday Massacre!&quot;, and are all voiced by Eric Bauza. In the season two episode, &quot;The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot!&quot;, it is revealed the feud between them and Scrooge McDuck originated from a battle between Duckburg&#x27;s founder Cornelius Coot and the Beagles of that time. The latter attempted to attack a fort the former was holding, only to be tricked into retreating when Coot used popcorn makers to make the Beagles think he was everywhere at once. The fort would go on to become Fort Duckburg and strike up the feud for control of the land it was on. In a flashback depicted in the episode &quot;The Life and Crimes of Scrooge McDuck!&quot;, the Beagle Boys under Pappy Beagle temporarily took control of Fort Duckburg after stealing its deed, but Scrooge took it back from them, leading to a young Ma Beagle taking control of the gang from her father.

* Ma Beagle – The ringleader of all of the Beagle Boys and owner of their junkyard home. Contrary to her 1987 counterpart, she shows much less respect or affection for her sons.
* The Original Classics – A trio of Beagle Boys consisting of Bigtime, Burger, and Bouncer Beagle, all of whom debuted in the episode &quot;Daytrip of Doom!&quot; They depart drastically from their 1987 counterparts in that Bigtime is dumber than his original counterpart and has delusions of grandeur; Burger is tall, skinny, and mute; and Bouncer is now the same size as the 1987 Bankjob.
* The Glam Yankees – A trio of Colonial Yankee/glam rock-themed Beagle Boys.
* The Déjà Vus – A trio of French-themed Beagle Boys whose name provides a gag, as they are introduced by Ma Beagle three times, similar to real world Déjà vu.
* The 6th Avenue Meanies – A trio of thuggish, brutish Beagle Boys led by Bad Attitude Beagle.
* The 6th Avenue Friendlies – A trio of well-mannered, dapper Beagle Boys led by Benevolent Beagle.
* The Longboard Taquitos – A trio of daredevil Beagle Boys who ride on skateboards, wear wingsuits, and speak with &quot;surfer dude&quot; accents.
* The Tumblebums – A trio of Gothic circus Beagle Boys who primarily whistle instead of talking and consist of a muscular clown, a stilt-walker, and an acrobat. According to the other Beagles, they are rumored to be adopted.
* The Ugly Failures – A trio of unattractive, incompetent Beagle Boys consisting of Botched Job, Bungle, and Bottle Beagle.
* Black Arts Beagle – A Beagle Boy who works as a stage magician and differs from the others in that he has gray fur instead of tan.
* Broadway and Backfield Beagle – Two Beagle Boys who appear in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; comics with a movie director and football theme, respectively.
* Bomber and Butcher Beagle – Two ice hockey playing Beagles that also appear in the &quot;DuckTales&quot; comics.
* Grandpappy Beagle – Ma Beagle&#x27;s grandfather who most notably stole the deed to Duckburg before Scrooge won it from him in an arm-wrestling match and crashed the first annual McDuck Enterprises Christmas party.
* Grandpappy&#x27;s Gang – A trio of Beagle Boys consisting of Bankjob, Babyface, and Bugle Beagle.
* Pappy Beagle – Ma Beagle&#x27;s father who led the Beagle Boys in taking Fort Duckburg until Scrooge defeated him in an arm-wrestling match and Ma took control of the gang in response.
* Big Tech Beagle - A technologically literate Beagle Boy similar to Megabyte Beagle from the 1987 series.

===&quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;===
The Beagle Boys appeared as Pete&#x27;s henchmen in the film &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;. There are only three Beagle Boys in the film, one of them noted for being short (however, unlike Big Time, he was not the leader but more or less the &quot;idiot&quot; of the group), with gray skin and black hoods. They decide to depose Princess Minnie so Pete could become king. They were shown to be much more dangerous compared to their original &quot;DuckTales&quot; counterparts. These Beagle Boys were collectively voiced by Jeff Bennett and Maurice LaMarche.

These versions of the Beagle Boys appear in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;.

===&quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; &amp; &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;===
In the television series &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, the Beagle Boys appear in the episode &quot;Sock Burglar&quot; as part of the villains that Minnie interrogates, and in &quot;Touchdown and Out&quot; as part of the football team that Pete forms with them and Chernabog to play against Mickey, Donald and Goofy.

In the spin-off series &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;, they appear in the episode &quot;Keep on Rollin&#x27;&quot; arriving with Pete and Ursula at the roller rink where Mickey and his friends always enjoy, being kicked out by the group of villains from the place, and later having to face them in a roller skating competition to get their meeting place back.

<doc id="76617" wikidata="Q202548" url="?curid=76617" title="Vertigo (film)">
<text>Vertigo is a 1958 American psychological thriller film directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock. The story was based on the 1954 novel &quot;D&#x27;entre les morts&quot; (&quot;From Among the Dead&quot;) by Boileau-Narcejac, with a screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor. The film stars James Stewart as a former San Francisco police detective who has retired after an incident in the line of duty caused him to develop an extreme fear of heights, accompanied by vertigo. He is hired as a private investigator to report on the strange behavior of an acquaintance&#x27;s wife (Kim Novak).

The film was shot on location in San Francisco, as well as in Mission San Juan Bautista, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, and at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. The film stock of the camera negative was Eastman 25 ASA tungsten-balanced 5248 with processing and prints by Technicolor. It was the first film to use the dolly zoom, an in-camera effect that distorts perspective to create disorientation, to convey Scottie&#x27;s acrophobia; the technique is often referred to as &quot;the &quot;Vertigo&quot; effect&quot; in reference to its use in the film. In 1996, the film underwent a major restoration to create a new 70 mm print and DTS soundtrack.

&quot;Vertigo&quot; received mixed reviews on release, but it has since come to be considered Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and one of the greatest films of all time. In 1989, it was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film appears repeatedly in polls of the best films by the American Film Institute, including a 2007 ranking as the ninth-greatest American film ever. Attracting significant scholarly attention, it replaced &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; as the greatest film ever made in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; Greatest Films of All Time poll, and came in second place in the 2022 edition of the poll.

==Plot==
After a rooftop chase in which a fellow policeman falls to his death, San Francisco detective John &quot;Scottie&quot; Ferguson retires due to acrophobia and accompanying vertigo caused by the incident. Midge, his ex-fiancée, says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure. Midge retains feelings for Scottie but he is not receptive to her intimations.

Gavin Elster, an acquaintance from college, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming that she has been behaving strangely. Scottie follows Madeleine to the grave of Carlotta Valdes (1831–1857) at the Mission San Francisco de Asís and to the Legion of Honor art museum, where she gazes at the &quot;Portrait of Carlotta&quot;.

A local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes committed suicide: she had been the mistress of a wealthy married man and borne his child, and the otherwise childless man kept the child and cast Carlotta aside. Carlotta, who Gavin fears is possessing Madeleine, was Madeleine&#x27;s great-grandmother. However, Madeleine does not know this or remember the places she has visited while ostensibly possessed. Scottie trails her to Fort Point and rescues her after she jumps into San Francisco Bay.

The next day, Madeleine stops to deliver a letter of gratitude to Scottie, and they spend the day together. They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where they embrace. The next day, Madeleine recounts a nightmare, and Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista, Carlotta&#x27;s childhood home. He drives her there, and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower, asking Scottie not to follow her. Scottie runs after her, but is halted on the steps by his fear of heights and sees her plunge to her death.

An inquest into Madeleine&#x27;s death declares it a suicide, though the coroner rebukes Scottie for not doing more to save her. Gavin also does not fault Scottie, but Scottie becomes clinically depressed and is sent to a sanatorium in an almost catatonic state. Following his release, he frequents the places that Madeleine visited, often imagining that he sees her. One day, he notices a woman on the street who, although superficially very different, reminds him of Madeleine. He follows her into her apartment, where she identifies herself as Judy Barton, from Salina, Kansas.

A flashback reveals that Judy was the person Scottie knew as &quot;Madeleine Elster&quot;; she had been impersonating Gavin&#x27;s wife in an elaborate murder scheme. Gavin took advantage of Scottie&#x27;s fear of heights to substitute his wife&#x27;s freshly killed body in the apparent &quot;suicide jump&quot;. Judy writes a note to Scottie, confessing her involvement in the plot, but tears it up and decides to continue the charade, because she loves him.

The two begin seeing each other, but Scottie remains obsessed with &quot;Madeleine&quot; and asks Judy to change her clothes and dye her hair to resemble her. After she complies, he notices her wearing the necklace portrayed in Carlotta&#x27;s painting. Realizing the truth, he drives Judy back to the mission.

There, he tells her that he must re-enact the event that led to his madness, and that he now knows that &quot;Madeleine&quot; and Judy are the same person, with Judy having been Gavin&#x27;s mistress before being cast aside just as Carlotta had been. He forces her up the bell tower and makes her admit her deceit. He reaches the top, conquering his fear of heights. Judy confesses that Gavin paid her to impersonate a &quot;possessed&quot; Madeleine and begs Scottie to forgive her. He embraces Judy, but a shadowy figure—a nun investigating the noise—rises from the tower&#x27;s trapdoor, startling her. Judy lunges backward off the tower to her death; Scottie, bereaved once again but cured of his fear of heights, stands on the ledge in shock while the nun rings the mission bell.

==Themes and interpretations==
In his monograph dedicated to the study of &quot;Vertigo,&quot; Charles Barr has stated that the central theme of the film is psychological obsession, concentrating in particular on Scottie as obsessed with the women in his life. Barr notes, &quot;This story of a man who develops a romantic obsession with the image of an enigmatic woman has commonly been seen, by his colleagues as well as by critics and biographers, as one that engaged Hitchcock in an especially profound way; and it has exerted a comparable fascination on many of its viewers. After first seeing it as a teenager in 1958, Donald Spoto had gone back for 26 more viewings by the time he wrote &quot;The Art of Alfred Hitchcock&quot; in 1976. In a 1996 magazine article, Geoffrey O&#x27;Brien cites other cases of &#x27;permanent fascination&#x27; with &quot;Vertigo&quot;, and then casually reveals that he himself, starting at age 15, has seen it &#x27;at least thirty times&#x27;.&quot;

Critics have interpreted &quot;Vertigo&quot; variously as &quot;a tale of male aggression and visual control; as a map of female Oedipal trajectory; as a deconstruction of the male construction of femininity and of masculinity itself; as a stripping bare of the mechanisms of directorial, Hollywood studio and colonial oppression; and as a place where textual meanings play out in an infinite regress of self-reflexivity.&quot; Critic James F. Maxfield has suggested that &quot;Vertigo&quot; can be interpreted as a variation on Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s 1890 short story &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot;, in which the main narrative of the film is actually imagined by Scottie as he dangles from a building at the end of the opening rooftop chase.

==Production==

===Development===
The screenplay of &quot;Vertigo&quot; is an adaptation of the 1954 French novel &quot;D&#x27;entre les morts&quot; (&quot;From Among the Dead&quot;) by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. Hitchcock had attempted to buy the rights to the previous novel by the same authors, &quot;Celle qui n&#x27;était plus&quot; (&quot;She Who Was No More&quot;), but failed, and it was instead adapted by Henri-Georges Clouzot as &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot;. Although François Truffaut once suggested that &quot;D&#x27;entre les morts&quot; was specifically written for Hitchcock by Boileau and Narcejac, Narcejac subsequently denied that this was their intention. However, Hitchcock&#x27;s interest in their work meant that Paramount Pictures commissioned a synopsis of &quot;D&#x27;entre les morts&quot; in 1954, before it had even been translated into English (it appeared in translation as &quot;The Living and the Dead&quot; in 1956).

In the book, Judy&#x27;s involvement in Madeleine&#x27;s death was not revealed until the denouement; at the scriptwriting stage, Hitchcock suggested revealing the secret two-thirds of the way through the film so that the audience would understand Judy&#x27;s dilemma. After the first preview, Hitchcock was unsure whether or not to keep the &quot;letter writing scene&quot;, though he subsequently decided to remove it. Herbert Coleman, &quot;Vertigo&quot;″s associate producer and a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, felt the removal was a mistake; however, Hitchcock said to &quot;Release it just like that.&quot; James Stewart, acting as mediator, said to Coleman: &quot;Herbie, you shouldn&#x27;t get so upset with Hitch. The picture&#x27;s not that important.&quot; Hitchcock&#x27;s decision was supported by screenwriter Joan Harrison, another member of his circle, who felt that the film had been improved. Coleman reluctantly made the necessary edits. When Paramount head Barney Balaban received news of this, he ordered Hitchcock to &quot;Put the picture back the way it was,&quot; ensuring that the scene remained in the final cut.

===Writing===
Three screenwriters were involved in the writing of &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Hitchcock originally hired playwright Maxwell Anderson to write a screenplay, but rejected his work, which was titled &quot;Darkling, I Listen&quot; (a quotation from John Keats&#x27;s 1819 poem &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;). According to Charles Barr in his monograph dedicated to &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Anderson was the oldest (at 68) [of the three writers involved], the most celebrated for his stage work, and the least committed to cinema, though he had a joint script credit for Hitchcock&#x27;s preceding film &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;. He worked on adapting the novel during Hitchcock&#x27;s absence abroad, and submitted a treatment in September 1956.&quot;

A second version, written by Alec Coppel, again left the director dissatisfied. The final script was written by Samuel A. Taylor, who had been recommended to Hitchcock due to his knowledge of San Francisco, from notes by the director. Among Taylor&#x27;s creations was the character of Midge. Taylor attempted to take sole credit for the screenplay, but Coppel protested to the Screen Writers Guild, which determined that both writers (but not Anderson) were entitled to a credit.

===Casting===
Vera Miles, who was under personal contract to Hitchcock and had appeared both on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and in &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;, was originally scheduled to play Madeleine, and modeled for an early version of the portrait of Carlotta. Following delays, including Hitchcock becoming ill with gallbladder problems, Miles became pregnant and had to withdraw from the role. The director declined to postpone shooting, and cast Kim Novak as Miles&#x27; replacement. By that time, Novak had delayed prior film commitments and a vacation promised by Columbia Pictures, the studio that held her contract, and Miles had given birth and was available for the film. Nevertheless, Hitchcock proceeded with Novak. Columbia head Harry Cohn agreed to lend Novak to &quot;Vertigo&quot; if Stewart would agree to co-star with Novak in &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot;, a Columbia production released in December 1958.

===Filming===

====Initial on-site principal photography====

&quot;Vertigo&quot; was filmed from September to December 1957. Principal photography began on location in San Francisco in September 1957 under the working title &quot;From Among the Dead&quot;. The film uses extensive location footage of the San Francisco Bay Area. In the driving scenes shot in San Francisco, the main characters&#x27; cars are almost always pictured heading down the city&#x27;s steeply inclined streets.

The scene in which Madeleine falls from the tower was filmed at Mission San Juan Bautista, a Spanish mission in San Juan Bautista, California. Associate producer Herbert Coleman&#x27;s daughter Judy Lanini suggested the mission to Hitchcock as a filming location. A steeple, added sometime after the mission&#x27;s original construction and secularization, had been demolished following a fire, so Hitchcock added a bell tower much larger than the one previously at the mission using scale models, matte paintings, and trick photography at Paramount Studios.

In October 1996, the restored print of &quot;Vertigo&quot; debuted at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco with a live on-stage introduction by Kim Novak. Visiting the San Francisco film locations has accrued modest tourist appeal; such a tour is featured in a subsection of Chris Marker&#x27;s 1983 documentary montage &quot;Sans Soleil&quot;.

=====List of shooting locations=====

*Scottie&#x27;s apartment (900 Lombard Street) is one block downhill from the &quot;crookedest street in the world&quot;. The facade of the building remained mostly intact until 2012, when the owner of the property erected a wall enclosing the entrance area on the Lombard side of the building.
*The rooftop chase took place on Taylor Street between 1302 and 1360. 1308 Taylor Street went up for sale in 2016 for $2.2 million.
*The Mission San Juan Bautista, where Madeleine falls from the tower, is a real place, but the tower had to be matted in with a painting using studio effects; Hitchcock had first visited the mission before the tower was torn down due to dry rot, and was reportedly displeased to find it missing when he returned to film. The original tower was much smaller than the one depicted in the film.
*The Carlotta Valdes headstone featured in the film, created by the props department, was left at Mission Dolores. The headstone was later removed, as the mission considered it disrespectful to the dead. All other cemeteries in San Francisco had been evicted from the city limits in 1912, so the screenwriters had no other option but to locate the grave at Mission Dolores.
*Madeleine jumps into the bay at Fort Point, underneath the Golden Gate Bridge.
*The gallery where Carlotta&#x27;s painting appears is the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. The Carlotta Valdes portrait was lost after being removed from the gallery, but many of the other paintings in the background of the portrait scenes are still on view.
*What purports to be Muir Woods National Monument in the film is in fact Big Basin Redwoods State Park; however, the cutaway of the redwood tree showing its age was copied from one that can still be found at Muir Woods.
*The coastal region where Scottie and Madeleine first kiss is Cypress Point, along the 17 Mile Drive near Pebble Beach. However, the lone tree they kiss next to was a prop brought specially to the location.
*The domed building Scottie and Judy walk past is the Palace of Fine Arts.
*Coit Tower appears in many background shots; Hitchcock once said that he included it as a phallic symbol. Also prominent in the background is the tower of the San Francisco Ferry Building.
*The exterior of the sanatorium where Scottie is treated was St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital, located at 355 Buena Vista East, across from Buena Vista Park. The hospital, which was not a sanatorium, was closed in 1979 and then converted into condominiums. The building, built in 1928, is on the National Register of Historic Places.
*Gavin and Madeleine&#x27;s apartment building &quot;The Brocklebank&quot; at 1000 Mason Street on Nob Hill still looks essentially the same. It is across the street from the Fairmont Hotel, where Hitchcock usually stayed when he visited the city and where many of the cast and crew stayed during filming. Shots of the surrounding neighborhood feature the James C. Flood Mansion and Grace Cathedral. Barely visible is the Mark Hopkins Hotel, mentioned in an early scene in the movie.
*The &quot;McKittrick Hotel&quot; was a privately owned Victorian mansion from the 1880s at Gough and Eddy Streets. It was torn down in 1959 and is now an athletic practice field for Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory School. The St. Paulus Lutheran Church, seen across from the mansion, was destroyed in a fire in 1995.
*Podesta Baldocchi is the flower shop Madeleine visits as she is being followed by Scottie. The shop&#x27;s location at the time of filming was 224 Grant Avenue; it has since moved to 410 Harriet Street.
*The Empire Hotel is a real place, called the York Hotel, and now the Hotel Vertigo at 940 Sutter Street. Judy&#x27;s room was created on set, but the green neon of the &quot;Hotel Empire&quot; sign outside is based on the actual hotel&#x27;s sign.
*Ernie&#x27;s (847 Montgomery St.) was a real restaurant in Jackson Square, from Scottie&#x27;s apartment. It is no longer operating.
*One short scene shows Union Square at dawn. Pop Leibel&#x27;s bookstore, the Argosy, was not a real location, but one recreated on the Paramount lot in imitation of the real-life Argonaut Book Store, which still exists near Sutter and Jones.
*Elster&#x27;s fictitious Dogpatch shipyard office was filmed at the real (or simulated with mattes) Union Iron Works shipyard, by then the Bethlehem Steel shipyard. Elster&#x27;s office has a Mission telephone exchange (MI or 64) prefix, regarding which Midge says &quot;Why, that&#x27;s Skid Row&quot;.

====Subsequent studio shooting====
Following 16 days of location shooting, the production moved to Paramount&#x27;s studios in Hollywood for two months of filming. Hitchcock preferred to film in studios as he was able to control the environment. Once sufficient location footage had been obtained, interior sets were designed and constructed in the studio.

Hitchcock popularized the dolly zoom in this film, leading to the technique&#x27;s sobriquet, amongst several others, &quot;the &quot;Vertigo&quot; effect&quot;. This &quot;dolly-out/zoom-in&quot; method involves the camera physically moving away from a subject whilst simultaneously zooming in (a similar effect can be achieved in reverse), so that the subject retains its size in the frame, but the background&#x27;s perspective changes. Hitchcock used the effect to look down the tower shaft to emphasise its height and Scottie&#x27;s disorientation. Following difficulties filming the shot on a full-sized set, a model of the tower shaft was constructed, and the dolly zoom was filmed horizontally. The &quot;special sequence&quot; (Scottie&#x27;s nightmare sequence) was designed by artist John Ferren, who also created the painting of Carlotta.

The rotating patterns in the title sequence were created by animator John Whitney using a Kerrison Predictor, a mechanical computer which was used during World War II to aim anti-aircraft cannons at moving targets. This made it possible to produce an animated version of Lissajous curves.

===Costume design===
Hitchcock and costume designer Edith Head used color to heighten emotion. Grey was chosen for Madeleine&#x27;s suit in an attempt to be psychologically jarring, as it is not usually a blonde&#x27;s color. In contrast, Novak&#x27;s character wore a white coat when she visited Scottie&#x27;s apartment, which Head and Hitchcock considered more natural for a blonde to wear.

===Alternative ending===
A coda to the film was shot that showed Midge at her apartment, listening to a radio report (voiced by San Francisco TV reporter Dave McElhatton) describing the pursuit of Gavin Elster across Europe. Midge switches the radio off when Scottie enters the room, and they then share a drink and look out of the window in silence. Contrary to reports that this scene was filmed to meet foreign censorship needs, this tag ending had originally been demanded by Geoffrey Shurlock of the U.S. Production Code Administration, who had noted: &quot;It will, of course, be most important that the indication that Elster will be brought back for trial is sufficiently emphasized.&quot;

Hitchcock ultimately succeeded in fending off most of Shurlock&#x27;s demands, including toning down erotic allusions, and had the alternative ending dropped. The footage was discovered in Los Angeles in May 1993, and was added as an alternative ending on LaserDisc, DVD, and Blu-ray releases of the film.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s score was written by regular Hitchcock collaborator Bernard Herrmann. It was conducted by Muir Mathieson and recorded in Europe because of a musicians&#x27; strike in the United States.

In a 2004 special issue of the British Film Institute&#x27;s magazine &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, director Martin Scorsese described the qualities of Herrmann&#x27;s score:

Hitchcock&#x27;s film is about obsession, which means that it&#x27;s about circling back to the same moment, again and again... And the music is also built around spirals and circles, fulfillment and despair. Herrmann really understood what Hitchcock was going for — he wanted to penetrate to the heart of obsession.

===Graphic design===
Graphic designer Saul Bass used spiral motifs in both the title sequence and the movie poster, emphasizing what the documentary &quot;Obsessed with Vertigo&quot; calls the film&#x27;s &quot;psychological vortex&quot;. Bass&#x27;s unconventional framing of actress Audrey Lowell&#x27;s facial features in the first images of the titles was indebted to Bauhaus photography. According to her 1997 &quot;Guardian&quot; interview, Kim Novak wanted to do the opening title sequence but Harry Cohn insisted Hitchcock pay full rate for the single day&#x27;s shooting and so another face was chosen.

==Release==
&quot;Vertigo&quot; premiered in San Francisco on May 9, 1958, at the Stage Door Theater (now the August Hall nightclub). While &quot;Vertigo&quot; did break even upon its original release, earning $3.2 million in North American distributor rentals against its $2,479,000 cost, it earned significantly less than other Hitchcock productions.

===Restoration and re-release===

In October 1983, &quot;Rear Window&quot; and &quot;Vertigo&quot; were the first two Hitchcock films reissued by Universal Pictures after the studio acquired the rights from the director&#x27;s estate. These two films – along with &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1956), &quot;Rope&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; (1955) – had been kept out of distribution by the director since 1968. Cleaning and restoration were performed on each film when new 35 mm prints were struck.

In 1996, the film was given a lengthy and controversial restoration by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz and re-released to theaters. The new print featured restored color and newly created audio, using modern sound effects mixed in DTS digital surround sound. In October 1996, the restored &quot;Vertigo&quot; premiered at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, with Kim Novak and Patricia Hitchcock attending. At this screening, the film was exhibited for the first time in DTS and 70mm, a format with a similar frame size to the VistaVision system in which it was originally shot.

Significant color correction was necessary because of the fading of original negatives. In some cases a new negative was created from the silver separation masters, but in many instances this was impossible because of differential separation shrinkage, and because the 1958 separations were poorly made. Separations used three individual films: one for each of the primary colors. In the case of &quot;Vertigo&quot;, these had shrunk in different and erratic proportions, making re-alignment impossible.

As such, significant amounts of computer assisted coloration were necessary. Although the results are not noticeable on viewing the film, some elements were as many as eight generations away from the original negative, in particular the entire &quot;Judy&#x27;s Apartment&quot; sequence. When such large portions of re-creation become necessary, then the danger of artistic license by the restorers becomes an issue, and the restorers received some criticism for their re-creation of colors that allegedly did not honor the director&#x27;s and cinematographer&#x27;s intentions. The restoration team argued that they did research on the colors used in the original locations, cars, wardrobe, and skin tones. One breakthrough came when the Ford Motor Company supplied a well-preserved green paint sample for a car used in the film. As the color green has extensive symbolic use in the film, matching a shade of green was important for restoration and provided a reference shade.

When restoring the sound, Harris and Katz wanted to stay as close as possible to the original, and had access to the original music recordings that had been stored in the vaults at Paramount. However, as the project demanded a new 6-channel DTS soundtrack, it was necessary to re-record some sound effects. The soundtrack was remixed at the Alfred Hitchcock Theatre at Universal Studios. Aware that the film had a considerable following, the restoration team knew that they were under particular pressure to restore the film as accurately as possible. To achieve this, they used Hitchcock&#x27;s original dubbing notes for guidance of how the director wanted the film to sound. Harris and Katz sometimes added extra sound effects to camouflage &quot;hisses, pops, and bangs&quot; in the old soundtrack; in particular, they added extra seagull cries and a foghorn to the scene at Cypress Point.

===Home media===

In 1996, director Harrison Engle produced the documentary &quot;Obsessed with Vertigo&quot;. Narrated by Roddy McDowall, the film played on American Movie Classics, and has since been included with DVD versions of &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Surviving members of the cast and crew participated, along with Martin Scorsese and Patricia Hitchcock. Engle first visited the &quot;Vertigo&quot; shooting locations in the summer of 1958, just months after completion of the film.

&quot;Vertigo&quot; was first released on DVD in March 1998. On October 4, 2011, the film was re-issued on DVD by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment as part of the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock: The Essentials Collection&quot;. Subsequently, the film was released on Blu-ray on September 25, 2012, as part of the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock: The Masterpiece Collection&quot;. In May 2014, the film was re-released as a stand-alone Blu-ray edition. Some home video releases, such as the 2005 &quot;Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection&quot; DVD set, contain the original mono track as an option.

In October 2014, a new 4K restoration was presented at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco. This version gives credit to Harris and Katz at the end of the film, and thanks them for providing some previously unknown stereo soundtracks. This version, however, removes some of the &quot;excessive&quot; Foley sounds that were added in the 1996 restoration.

In September 2020, an Ultra HD Blu-ray was released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment as a part of the first volume of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Classics Collection&quot;. In September 2021, a stand-alone version was released alongside a SteelBook.

==Reception==

===Contemporaneous reception===
Initial critical reception for &quot;Vertigo&quot; was mixed. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film showed Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;mastery&quot;, but felt the film was &quot;too long and slow&quot; for &quot;what is basically only a psychological murder mystery&quot;. Similarly, Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; admired the scenery, but found the plot took &quot;too long to unfold&quot; and felt it &quot;bogs down in a maze of detail&quot;. Scholar Dan Auiler says that this review &quot;sounded the tone that most popular critics would take with the film&quot;. However, the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; loved it, admiring the &quot;excitement, action, romance, glamor and [the] crazy, off-beat love story&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther also gave &quot;Vertigo&quot; qualified praise by stating that &quot;[the] secret [of the film] is so clever, even though it is devilishly far-fetched.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film as a &quot;wonderful weirdie,&quot; writing that &quot;Hitchcock has even more fun than usual with trick angles, floor shots and striking use of color. More than once he gives us critical scenes in long shots establishing how he&#x27;s going to get away with a couple of story tricks.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote derisively that Hitchcock had &quot;never before indulged in such farfetched nonsense.&quot;

The &quot;New York Post&quot; review echoed many critics&#x27;: &quot;Let&#x27;s admit it right now. Hitchcock&#x27;s surfaces are so smooth he thinks he can get away with murder in the logic and realism departments. If you want to tear &#x27;Vertigo&#x27; apart, it rips easily. On the other hand, there&#x27;s no denying that James Stewart&#x27;s unactorish acting carries a heavy air of reality into the picture, and Kim Novak&#x27;s somnambulistic behavior, called for by the script, is something she can do to perfection...It&#x27;s doubtful that &#x27;Vertigo&#x27; can take equal rank with the best of the Hitchcock studies—it has too many holes—but it assays high in visual confectionary of place, person, and celluloid wiles.&quot;

Contemporaneous response in England was summarized by Charles Barr in his monograph on &quot;Vertigo&quot;: &quot;In England, the reception was if anything rather less friendly. Of the 28 newspaper and magazine reviews that I have looked at, six are, with reservations, favourable, nine are very mixed, and 13 almost wholly negative. Common to all of these reviews is a lack of sympathy with the basic structure and drive of the picture. Even the friendlier ones single out for praise elements that seem, from today&#x27;s perspective, to be marginal virtues and incidental pleasures – the &#x27;vitality&#x27; of the supporting performances (Dilys Powell in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;), the slickness with which the car sequences are put together (Isobel Quibley in &quot;The Spectator&quot;)&quot;.

In France, Éric Rohmer noted in &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; that &quot;&quot;Vertigo&quot;, so they say, repelled Americans. French critics, on the contrary, seem to be giving it a warm welcome.&quot; Praising the film&#x27;s formal technique, he wrote that &quot;ideas and forms follow the same road, and it is because the form is pure, beautiful, rigorous, astonishingly rich, and free that we can say that Hitchcock&#x27;s films, with &quot;Vertigo&quot; at their head, are about &quot;ideas&quot;, in the noble, platonic sense of the word.&quot;

Hitchcock fans were not pleased with &quot;Vertigo&quot;&#x27;s departure from the romantic-thriller territory of earlier films, or with the mystery being solved well before the film&#x27;s ending. Orson Welles disliked the film, telling Henry Jaglom that it was &quot;worse&quot; than &quot;Rear Window&quot;, which he had also disliked. In an interview with François Truffaut, Hitchcock stated that &quot;Vertigo&quot; was one of his favourite films, with some reservations. He blamed the film&#x27;s limited success on the 49-year-old Stewart looking too old to play a convincing love interest for the 24-year-old Novak.

A young Martin Scorsese viewed the film with his friends during its original theatrical run, and later recalled that &quot;even though the film was not well received at the time... we responded to the film very strongly. [We] didn&#x27;t know why... but we really went with the picture.&quot;

The film received awards at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, including a Silver Seashell for Best Director for Hitchcock (tied with Mario Monicelli for &quot;Big Deal on Madonna Street&quot;) and Best Actor for Stewart (tied with Kirk Douglas in &quot;The Vikings&quot;). The film was nominated for two technical Academy Awards for Best Art Direction – Black-and-White or Color (Hal Pereira, Henry Bumstead, Samuel M. Comer, Frank McKelvy) and Best Sound (George Dutton).

===Re-evaluation===
Over time the film has been re-evaluated by film critics and has moved higher in esteem in most critics&#x27; opinions. Every ten years since 1952, the British Film Institute magazine &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; has asked the world&#x27;s leading film critics to compile a list of the ten greatest films of all time. In the 1962 and 1972 polls, &quot;Vertigo&quot; was not among the top 10 films in voting; only in 1982, after Hitchcock&#x27;s death, did &quot;Vertigo&quot; enter the list, in seventh place. By 1992 it had advanced to fourth place, by 2002 to second, and in 2012 to first place in both the crime genre and overall, ahead of previous first-place entry &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;; in the 2022 poll, it took second place behind &quot;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&quot;. In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; director&#x27;s poll of the greatest films ever made &quot;Vertigo&quot; was ranked seventh; In the 2002 and 2022 editions of the directors&#x27; list the film ranked sixth.

Commenting upon the 2012 results, the magazine&#x27;s editor Nick James said that &quot;Vertigo&quot; was &quot;the ultimate critics&#x27; film. It is a dream-like film about people who are not sure who they are but who are busy reconstructing themselves and each other to fit a kind of cinema ideal of the ideal soul-mate.&quot; In recent years, critics have noted that the casting of Stewart as a character who becomes disturbed and obsessive ultimately enhances the film&#x27;s unconventionality and suspense, since Stewart had previously been known for warmhearted roles.

In 1998, &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a poll in which &quot;Vertigo&quot; was voted the fifth greatest film of all time. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;Vertigo&quot; at No. 3 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it the 19th Greatest film of all time in 1999. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 96 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics. In 2009, the film was ranked at No. 10 on Japanese film magazine &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot;″s &quot;Top 10 Non-Japanese Films of All Time&quot; list. In 2022, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked the film at No.15 on their list of &quot;The 100 best thriller films of all time&quot;.

Already in the 1960s, &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; critics had begun re-evaluating Hitchcock as a serious artist. The film ranked eighth on &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;″s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1959. However, even François Truffaut&#x27;s 1962 book of interviews with Hitchcock devotes only a few pages to &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Dan Auiler has suggested that the real beginning of &quot;Vertigo&quot;″s re-evaluation was the 1968 publication of British-Canadian scholar Robin Wood&#x27;s book &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s Films&quot;, which called it &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s masterpiece to date and one of the four or five most profound and beautiful films the cinema has yet given us&quot;.

Adding to its mystique was the fact that &quot;Vertigo&quot; was one of five Hitchcock-owned films removed from circulation in 1973. When &quot;Vertigo&quot; was re-released in theaters in October 1983, and then on home video in October 1984, it achieved commercial success and laudatory reviews. The October 1996 showing of a restored print on 70 mm film with DTS sound at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco was met with a similarly strong reception. In his 1996 review of the film, critic Roger Ebert gave it four stars out of four and included it in his list of The Great Movies.

A minority of critics have expressed dissenting opinions. In his 2004 book &quot;Blockbuster&quot;, British film critic Tom Shone suggested that &quot;Vertigo&quot;″s critical re-evaluation has led to excessive praise: &quot;Hitchcock is a director who delights in getting his plot mechanisms buffed up to a nice humming shine, and so the &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; team praise the one film of his in which this is not the case – it&#x27;s all loose ends and lopsided angles, its plumbing out on display for the critic to pick over at his leisure.&quot;

In 1989, &quot;Vertigo&quot; was recognized as a &quot;culturally, historically and aesthetically significant&quot; film by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in the first year of the registry&#x27;s voting.

In 2005, &quot;Vertigo&quot; was ranked at number two in &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Movies of All Time,&quot; behind only &quot;Goodfellas&quot;. In 2008, an &quot;Empire&quot; poll of readers, actors, and critics named it the 40th greatest movie ever made. The film was voted at No. 8 on the 2008 list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked it as the third-best crime film of all time. &quot;Vertigo&quot; ranked third on the BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 87 reviews, with an average rating of 8.90/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads deems it &quot;an unpredictable scary thriller that doubles as a mournful meditation on love, loss, and human comfort&quot;. As of February 2024, &quot;Vertigo&quot; is one of only fourteen films with a perfect score on Metacritic (two other Hitchcock films, &quot;Notorious&quot; and &quot;Rear Window&quot;, are also on the list).

The most recent edition of the American Film Institute&#x27;s top 100 films of all time, released in 2007, placed Vertigo at number nine, up 52 positions from its placement at number 61 in the original 1998 list.

The San Francisco locations have become celebrated amongst the film&#x27;s fans, with organized tours across the area. In March 1997, the French magazine &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; published a special issue about &quot;Vertigo&#x27;s&quot; locations in San Francisco, &quot;Dans le décor&quot;.

Director Martin Scorsese has listed &quot;Vertigo&quot; as one of his favorite films of all time.

The renewed public appreciation for &quot;Vertigo&quot; is accompanied by a growing body of academic scholarship. Conferences like the Annual International Vertigo conference, for instance, showcase this trend, as evidenced by its 2018 event at Trinity College Dublin.

===Classification as film noir===
Critical opinion is divided on whether or not &quot;Vertigo&quot; should be considered an example of film noir. Some consider it a film noir on the basis of plot and tone and various motifs, despite it having mid-century modern visuals typical of the 1950s. Others say the use of Technicolor, color symbolism, and the specificity of Hitchcock&#x27;s vision exclude it from the category. Nicholas Christopher, Robert Ottoson, and Silver and Ward, for instance, do not include &quot;Vertigo&quot; in their filmographies of film noir. By contrast, Foster Hirsch describes &quot;Vertigo&quot; as among the Hitchcock films that are &quot;richly, demonstrably &quot;noir&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="76619" wikidata="Q2635222" url="?curid=76619" title="What's Opera, Doc?">
<text>What&#x27;s Opera, Doc? is a 1957 American Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and written by Michael Maltese. The short was released on July 6, 1957, and stars Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.

The story features Elmer chasing Bugs through a parody of 19th-century classical composer Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas, particularly &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (&quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;), &quot;Der Fliegende Holländer&quot; (&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;), and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. It borrows heavily from the second opera in the &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, woven around the typical Bugs–Elmer feud. Most of the dialogue is performed in recitative. The short marks the final appearance of Elmer Fudd in a Chuck Jones cartoon.

It has been widely praised in the animation industry as the greatest animated cartoon that Warner Bros. ever released, and it has been ranked as such in the top 50 animated cartoons of all time. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed it &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

==Plot==
Dressed as the demigod Siegfried (and cutting a less than impressive figure as such), Elmer Fudd is pursuing Bugs Bunny when he finds rabbit tracks and arrives at Bugs&#x27; hole. Elmer jams his spear into the hole while singing &quot;Kill the wabbit!&quot; repeatedly to the tune of &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;. Bugs sticks his head out of another rabbit hole and converses with Elmer about his spear and magic helmet. This prompts a display of Elmer-as-Siegfried&#x27;s magic powers. Bugs flees in fear, and Elmer pursues.

Elmer stops in his tracks at the sight of the beautiful Valkyrie Brünnhilde (Bugs in drag). &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Brünnhilde&quot; exchange endearments and perform a ballet (based on the Venusberg ballet in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;). Bugs&#x27; true identity is exposed when his headdress falls off, enraging Elmer. Bugs discards his disguise and runs. Elmer&#x27;s wrath causes a storm to brew, tearing apart the mountains where Bugs has fled. Upon seeing Bugs&#x27; lifeless body, Elmer regrets his wrath and tearfully carries Bugs off to Valhalla in keeping with the Wagnerian theme per Act III of the Valkyries. Bugs breaks the fourth wall and raises his head to address the audience in his normal speaking voice, &quot;Well, what did you expect in an opera? A &quot;happy&quot; ending?&quot; before going back to being dead.

==Voice cast==
*Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny (as Brünnhilde), Elmer Fudd (yelling &quot;SMOG!&quot;)
*Arthur Q. Bryan as Elmer Fudd (as Siegfried) (uncredited)

==Production==
Originally released to theaters by Warner Bros. on July 6, 1957, &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; features the speaking and singing voices of Mel Blanc and Arthur Q. Bryan as Bugs and Elmer, respectively. This is the third of the three Warner Bros. shorts (the others being &quot;Hare Brush&quot; and &quot;Rabbit Rampage&quot;) in which Elmer defeats Bugs (though here the former shows regret for defeating the latter), as well as the last Elmer Fudd cartoon directed by Jones.

&quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; required about six times as much work and expense as any of the other six-minute cartoons his production unit was turning out at the time. Jones admitted as much, having described a surreptitious re-allocation of production time to complete the short. During the six minutes of &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;, Jones lampoons Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;, the contemporary style of ballet, Wagner&#x27;s perceived ponderous operatic style, and even the by-then clichéd Bugs-and-Elmer formula.

===Story development and layout===
Michael Maltese wrote the parody&#x27;s storyline and, in collaboration with Chuck Jones, the comedic lyrics set to Wagner&#x27;s music, including the duet &quot;Return My Love&quot;. Some elements of the cartoon drew upon previous animated works at Warner Bros. Maltese himself had originated the concept of depicting Bugs in Valkyrie-styled drag and mounted on a fat horse. Twelve years before the production of &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;, he had devised a very similar sequence for the cartoon &quot;Herr Meets Hare&quot; directed by Friz Freleng. That anti-Nazi short was released by Warner Bros. to American theaters in January 1945, just several months before Germany&#x27;s surrender to Allied forces in World War II. Wearing a blonde braided wig under a medieval horned helmet and carrying a shield, Bugs in that earlier film rides across the screen to the tune of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Chorus&quot;, a selection from Wagner&#x27;s 1845 opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;.

The highly stylized backdrops and entire color scheme for &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; were done by art director Maurice Noble and were reportedly so &quot;daring&quot; at the time that the production&#x27;s overall design &quot;sent the studio into a &quot;. Noble later remarked, &quot;They thought I was when I put that bright red on Elmer with those purple skies&quot;. According to him, some employees in Warner&#x27;s Ink and Paint Department assumed that a variety of color specifications he sent to them were errors. Staff, Noble recalled, would ask questions such as You really mean you want that magenta red on that?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Yes, that&#x27;s the way.

===Chuck Jones&#x27; obsession with a missing sound effect===
During the final editing of the short, a &quot;tiny sound effect&quot; was omitted from the master footage, an omission that for decades continued to disturb Chuck Jones whenever he viewed the cartoon after its initial release. In August 2017, the online animation journal &quot;The Dot and Line&quot; published an interview it conducted with Stephen Fossati, who was Jones&#x27; &quot;last protégé&quot; and worked with the legendary cartoonist and director from 1993 until his death in 2002. Fossati in that interview spoke with Erik Vilas-Boas, the co-founder of &quot;The Dot and Line&quot;, about Jones&#x27; &quot;diligence to his craft&quot; and his &quot;relentless perfectionism&quot;. With regard to the absent sound effect, Vilas-Boas quoted Fossati&#x27;s comments about his mentor&#x27;s 45-year obsession with that &quot;minuscule&quot; detail in the film:

==The legacy of &quot;Kill the Wabbit&quot;==
&quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; is sometimes alluded to informally in conversations and in online and printed references as &quot;Kill the Wabbit&quot;. This unofficial, alternative title is derived from the line sung by Elmer to the tune of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, part of the opening passage from Act Three of &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, which is also the leitmotif of the Valkyries. For his 2016 article about the cartoon, one titled &quot;How Bugs Bunny and &#x27;Kill the Wabbit&#x27; Inspired a Generation of Opera Stars&quot;, Michael Phillips of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; examined how &quot;a cartoon rabbit and his speech-impaired nemesis&quot; provided many children in 1957 and in the decades thereafter their first, albeit absurd exposure to Wagner&#x27;s compositions and to the world of opera.

Phillips in his article furnishes comments by various operatic performers and stage crews regarding how watching &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; affected them personally as children and in some cases contributed to the early development of their theatrical careers. Mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Bishopa native of Greenville, South Carolina and a featured performer at the Washington National Opera, the San Francisco Opera, and the Metropolitan Operastated to Phillips, I could sing you the entire cartoon before I knew what opera really was, adding Those of us who didn&#x27;t freak at the sight of a rabbit in a winged helmet sliding off of the back of a fat horsewe went into opera. Jamie Barton, another notable American mezzo-soprano, also shared with Phillips her reactions to seeing the short for the first time in the mid-1990s, when she was a middle-schooler growing up in Athens, Georgia. As she prepared in 2016 for her performance as Waltraute in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Barton reflected on &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; and credited it and Warner Bros.&#x27; earlier burlesque short &quot;Rabbit of Seville&quot; with initially drawing her attention to opera and instilling in her a &quot;love&quot; for classical works, especially the music of Italian composer Gioachino Rossini. I had never, she remarked to Phillips, been exposed to opera music before Bugs Bunny.

Michael Heaston, a former pianist for the Dallas Opera and in 2016 an adviser to the director of the Washington National Opera, also described to Phillips his memories of seeing &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; and other Warner Bros. cartoons as a small child in West Des Moines, Iowa. For Heaston those shorts served as that ultimately led him to establishing a career in opera. At a very base level, he noted, that&#x27;s what I got from Looney Tunes at a very early age: I learned how to tell stories through music.

In his autobiography &quot;Chuck Amuck&quot;, Jones singled out &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; &quot;for sheer production quality, magnificent music and wonderful animation, this is probably our (unit&#x27;s) most elaborate and satisfying production&quot;.

===The 50th anniversary of &quot;&#x27;Kill Da Wabbit&#x27;&quot;, 2007===
The enduring audience appeal of &quot;What&#x27;s Opera Doc?&quot; extends beyond stage professionals and the borders of the United States. In Canada in 2007, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper featured in its July 8 issue an article by Steve Watt titled &quot;50 glorious years of &#x27;kill da wabbit&#x27;&quot;. Watt, a cartoon historian and owner of an animation art gallery in Toronto, discusses in his article the golden anniversary that two days earlier had marked the initial release of the short, and he assesses its continuing popularity. &quot;No one&quot;, he writes, &quot;who knows and loves &#x27;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&#x27; will ever hear Wagner&#x27;s &#x27;Der Ring des Nibelungen&#x27; without hearing, in their own minds, &#x27;Kill da wabbit...kill da wabbit.&#x27;&quot; Watt continues, &quot;While classical music may be offended by that fact, I&#x27;m okay with it. More than okay with it.&quot; He then describes a past event he had organized and held at a Toronto movie theater, where he presented a selection of Chuck Jones&#x27; cartoons. He also describes the audience&#x27;s reaction to seeing the shorts on the &quot;big screen&quot;, including &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot;:
Such reactions to &quot;the Wagnerian mini epic&quot; a half century after its release once again attest to the cartoon&#x27;s unique composition and appeal, qualities that were even recognized as &quot;special&quot; in 1957 by some film-industry publications. For example, the Philadelphia-based journal &quot;Motion Picture Exhibitor&quot;, which in 1957 had a readership composed largely of theater owners and managers, reviewed the short in August that year and rated it &quot;excellent&quot;. The &quot;Exhibitor&quot; then prophetically observed, &quot;This is far above the usual run of animated cartoons and should find special favor in art houses, believe it or not.&quot;

===Addition to National Film Registry and the short&#x27;s historical rankings===
In 1992, the United States Library of Congress deemed &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; &quot;&#x27;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&#x27;&quot; and selected it for induction to the National Film Registry, making it the first short cartoon to receive that honor. Two more Warner Bros. cartoons were later inducted into the registry: &quot;Duck Amuck&quot; in 1999 and &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; in 2003. Their inclusion made Chuck Jones the only animator with three shorts thus recognized.

&quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; in 1994 ranked number one on a list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot; of all time. The list, compiled by animation historian Jerry Beck, was the result of his surveying and evaluating the opinions of 1,000 professional animators. One of those professionals was Steve Schneider, a longtime employee of Warner Bros. and an authority on the history of animated productions at the studio and an avid collector of cartoon art. In Beck&#x27;s survey, Schneider provides his own assessment of what makes this short so outstanding:

<doc id="76620" wikidata="Q1069773" url="?curid=76620" title="José Carioca">
<text>José &quot;Zé&quot; Carioca (; ) is a cartoon anthropomorphic parrot created by the Brazilian cartoonist José Carlos de Brito (J. Carlos) and shown to Walt Disney on his trip to Rio de Janeiro in 1941. The Walt Disney Company then incorporated the idea, being introduced in the 1942 film &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; as a friend of Donald Duck, described by &quot;Time&quot; as &quot;a dapper Brazilian parrot, who is as superior to Donald Duck as the Duck was to Mickey Mouse.&quot; He speaks Portuguese. He returned in the 1944 film &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; along with Donald and a Mexican rooster named Panchito Pistoles. José is from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (thus the name &quot;Carioca&quot;, which is a term used for a person born in Rio).

==Appearances==
===Animation===
In addition to &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; and &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (the Latin American film pair), José appeared with Donald and the Aracuan Bird in the &quot;Blame It on the Samba&quot; segment of the 1948 anthology feature &quot;Melody Time&quot;.

He also appeared in the segment &quot;Two Happy Amigos&quot; in a 1960 episode of the anthology television series &quot;Walt Disney Presents&quot;. Much later, he was seen in the Disney Channel series &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, as well as in two episodes of &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot; (&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Perfecto Day!&quot; and &quot;Super-Charged: Daisy&#x27;s Grande Goal&quot;) and an episode of &quot;Mickey Mouse Funhouse&quot; (&quot;Día de Muertos&quot;) alongside Panchito. He also made a brief cameo in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

In the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; short &quot;O Futebol Clássico&quot;, José is seen as the announcer of a Brazilian soccer game. He later appears with Donald and Panchito in &quot;¡Feliz Cumpleaños!&quot; as performers at Mickey&#x27;s birthday and in &quot;Carnaval&quot; as a performer in the parade.

José starred in the main role of &quot;Legend of the Three Caballeros&quot;, alongside Panchito Pistoles and Donald Duck, which was released on the Disney Life app. José&#x27;s cigar was removed in this series. He is voiced by Eric Bauza in this version.

He also appeared in a recurring role in the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; series, voiced by Bernardo de Paula, where he and Panchito used to be Donald&#x27;s old college bandmates who return to kickstart their band again. He&#x27;s revealed to work as a flight attendant and uses his umbrella as a weapon against enemies.

José also has a cameo appearance in the 2023 short film &quot;Once Upon a Studio&quot;, as part of the Walt Disney Animation Studios characters that take a group photo.

===Comics===
In the early 1940s, the Sunday-only &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; comic strip featured José Carioca, in a series running from October 11, 1942 to October 1, 1944. This was replaced by a Panchito strip, which ran for another year.

José is quite popular in Brazil, appearing alongside Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck in the local Disney comics. In Brazil, he is known as Zé Carioca (&quot;Zé&quot; being a familiar form for Portuguese name &quot;José&quot;, in much the same way &quot;Joe&quot; is a familiar form for the English name &quot;Joseph&quot;). Between 1961 and 2018, he had his Brazilian comic books, in which he is portrayed as living with his friends Nestor (an anthropomorphic crow), Afonsinho (an anthropomorphic duck), and Pedrão (an anthropomorphic dog), along with other characters: his nephews &quot;Zico&quot; and &quot;Zeca&quot; (also parrots), his girlfriend Maria Vaz (Portuguese: &quot;Rosinha Vaz&quot;, another anthropomorphic parrot), daughter of rich entrepreneur Rocha Vaz (an anthropomorphic toucan), and his romantic rival &quot;Zé Galo&quot; (an anthropomorphic rooster). Local production ended in 2001, but was restarted in 2012. José now has a pet, Old Tom, an alligator originated from the 1960s Studio Program duck stories. Since September 2020, new José stories are published by Culturama in the comic book &quot;Aventuras Disney&quot;.

Comics featuring Joe Carioca, as he is called in the Netherlands, appear occasionally in the Dutch &quot;Donald Duck&quot; magazine. In these short stories, José occupies his time assuming false identities to impress girls (who usually see through him, leaving him brokenhearted), and wangling free dinners in expensive restaurants, a habit that often gets him into trouble.

He appears extremely rarely in the German &quot;Micky Maus&quot; comics and , having appeared around 10 times since his 1980 debut.

In the Brazilian comics, Zé is also part of his neighborhood soccer team and runs a samba school. He has a secret identity as a superhero, &quot;Morcego Verde&quot; (&quot;Green Bat&quot;, a Batman spoof), although he is easily recognized by his neighbors.

In recent years, José Carioca has been used alongside Panchito and Donald in two comics by American artist Don Rosa, &quot;The Three Caballeros Ride Again&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Magnificent Seven (Minus 4) Caballeros&quot; (2005). The creation of a Brazilian animated character during the Second World War was part of a strategy called &quot;Good Neighbor Policy&quot; headed by the United States government to improve relations and gather support amongst its neighbor countries.

In 2023, Dutch stories introduced Parquita, José&#x27;s new girlfriend.

===Disney Parks===
In April 2007, Disney re-introduced José Carioca (along with the third Caballero, Panchito) in the newly revamped ride at Epcot&#x27;s Mexico Pavilion with entirely new animation and a new storyline. It has been dubbed &quot;The Gran Fiesta Tour&quot;. After being reunited, The Three Caballeros are set to play a show in Mexico City. But Donald goes missing. José and Panchito must search throughout Mexico for Donald as he takes in various sights around Mexico. The character was previously voiced by Rob Paulsen, although in June 2020 Paulsen announced that, as a Caucasian voice actor, he will no longer play characters of color, including the Brazilian José.

José can also be seen in the Hong Kong Disneyland version of It&#x27;s a Small World, which opened on April 28, 2008, as well as the Disneyland (in California) version of It&#x27;s a Small World, installed during major refurbishments between January and November 2008, also as the Tokyo Disneyland version of It&#x27;s a Small World, installed during major refurbishments between March 2017 and April 2018.

José and Panchito&#x27;s costumes were extinct at the Disneyland Resort by 2011, but were re-Imagineered for Mickey&#x27;s Soundsational Parade in May 2011. They now appear with Donald Duck and dancers with a float where Donald is trying to hit a Piñata. José and Panchito also regularly appear in the Walt Disney World Magic Kingdom parade, &quot;Move It! Shake It! MousekeDance It! Street Party&quot;, which debuted in 2014 and continues through 2020.

=== Television shows ===
In 1996, in Brazil, José presented the talk show &quot;Disney Club&quot; within the children&#x27;s program &quot;TV Colosso&quot;, shown on Sundays on TV Globo. The character&#x27;s puppet was manipulated by voice actor Marco Antônio Costa.

=== Video games ===
In 2002, José Carioca appears in the games of the Disney Sports series produced by Konami for Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube and Game Boy Advance platforms, José is part of The TinyRockets teams alongside Huey, Dewey, and Louie, the games are &quot;Disney Sports Soccer&quot; (Association football), &quot;Disney Sports Basketball&quot; (basketball) and &quot;Disney Sports Football&quot; (American football).

<doc id="76622" wikidata="Q744013" url="?curid=76622" title="Waterloo (album)">
<text>Waterloo is the second studio album by the Swedish pop group ABBA, and the first released internationally. It was originally released on 4 March 1974 in Sweden through Polar Music. The album&#x27;s title track won ABBA the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest and became a global hit, launching the group&#x27;s career.

== Recording ==
Recording sessions for &quot;Waterloo&quot; began on 24 September 1973 with the track &quot;Dance (While the Music Still Goes On)&quot;. This song was unusual in that it is the only ABBA track not to feature member Benny Andersson on keyboards, instead featuring American pianist John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick who was in Sweden at the time. Bundrick, however, was not credited on the album. Three weeks later the next two songs (&quot;Suzy-Hang-Around&quot; and &quot;My Mama Said&quot;) went into the studio. A recording sheet from the day credits the artist as &quot;ABBA&quot;, the first time the name was ever used in writing (the group had previously been called &quot;Björn &amp; Benny, Agnetha &amp; Anni-Frid&quot;), although their manager Stig Anderson had informally been calling them ABBA with the media for some time. The former of these songs marks the only time Benny Andersson sang lead on a track. Two more tracks were recorded on 17 October; &quot;What About Livingstone&quot; and &quot;Honey Honey&quot; – the latter being the second single released from the album in most countries. &quot;King Kong Song&quot; was recorded on 14 November, a song which members Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus today single out as one of their weakest tracks. This was also the date in which it was announced that ABBA were to appear at the Swedish selection for the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest. 

From that point, recording sessions sped up and the rest of the tracks were recorded. Two songs were up for consideration for their Eurovision entry; &quot;Waterloo&quot; and &quot;Hasta Mañana&quot;. The group preferred the former but felt the latter was a safer bet. Ultimately they chose &quot;Waterloo&quot; as it was more the direction they wished to take the group. &quot;Waterloo&quot; and &quot;Watch Out&quot; were recorded on the same day, with the latter becoming the B-side to the former.

== Release ==
&quot;Waterloo&quot; was released in March 1974. It was first released on CD in Sweden in 1988 alongside &quot;Ring Ring&quot; and the self titled album. It is the only CD version of the album to follow the original Scandinavian LP&#x27;s running order. Polydor first released &quot;Waterloo&quot;, along with &quot;Ring Ring&quot;, throughout Europe in 1990, with the discs being pressed in West Germany. These discs follow the running order of the Waterloo LP that was released in The Netherlands, swapping &quot;Watch Out&quot; and &quot;What About Livingstone?&quot; in the tracklist. In 1995, Polydor reissued their pressings of all of ABBA&#x27;s albums in the United States. The album has been reissued in digitally remastered form several times: in 1997 as part of &quot;The ABBA Remasters&quot; series, then in 2001 with an updated cover artwork and some bonus tracks, again in 2005 as part of &quot;The Complete Studio Recordings&quot; box set, and most recently in 2014 as a 40th anniversary &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; reissue. This version of the album entered the UK album charts.

On 5 April 2024, a new collection of vinyl products was released for the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration, featuring: a double-LP 45rpm half-speed mastered gatefold version of the album; a seven-inch box set with colored discs (red, white and blue) of &quot;Honey, Honey&quot; / &quot;King Kong Song&quot;, &quot;Waterloo&quot;/ &quot;Watch Out&quot; and &quot;Waterloo (Swedish Version)&quot; / &quot;Honey, Honey (Swedish Version)&quot;, respectively; and individual 7&quot; picture discs of these same three singles. A 10&quot; limited edition &quot;Waterloo&quot; single was also released, featuring the four different language versions of the track. The half-speed high-quality audio was mastered by Miles Showell at Abbey Road Studios.

=== Deluxe edition ===
On 7 April 2014, &quot;Waterloo&quot; was reissued as a 2-disc deluxe edition package for its 40th anniversary. The first disc consisted of a CD version of the original album, expanded with eight bonus tracks, and featuring: all the language versions of &quot;Waterloo&quot; (including an alternate mix of the English version), the Swedish version of &quot;Honey, Honey&quot;, and the 1974 US remix of &quot;Ring, Ring&quot;.

The second disc, a DVD, contained the &quot;International Sleeve Gallery&quot; along with thirteen TV appearances, eight of which were performances of &quot;Waterloo&quot;: two from the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot;, with a preview performance on SVT; two from &quot;Melodifestivalen&quot;, three from &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, and one German performance from NDR&#x27;s &quot;Musik aus Studio B&quot;. The remaining TV content included performances of &quot;Honey, Honey&quot; on &quot;Disco&quot; (ZDF), &quot;Spotlight&quot; (ORF), and &quot;Ein Kessel Buntes&quot; (Fernsehen der DDR), as well as an interview with Frida and Stig Anderson, following the band&#x27;s Eurovision victory. 

The set also came with a 20-page illustrated booklet with an essay on the making of the album. It is the last release from the ABBA Deluxe Edition album series.

=== Album cover ===
The album&#x27;s cover features the sub-title &quot;Björn, Benny, Agnetha &amp; Frida&quot; although some editions replaced &#x27;Agnetha&#x27; with &#x27;Anna&#x27; – by which Agnetha Fältskog was known in some countries. The cover photo was taken at Gripsholm Castle, in Mariefred, Sweden, and features bass player dressed as Napoleon.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Waterloo&quot; swept to victory at the Swedish heats and the group represented Sweden in Brighton for the Eurovision Song Contest 1974. ABBA won the contest and &quot;Waterloo&quot; became not only a massive hit in Europe but all over the world (peaking at No.6 in the US for example). In Sweden, the album had already been released and topped the Swedish album charts for 12 weeks, becoming one of the biggest-selling Swedish albums ever to that point. In the UK the album made No.28, the first time a foreign Eurovision act had charted an album and it performed well in the rest of Europe.

After the Melodifestovalen victory, Swedish tabloid newspaper Aftonbladet&#x27;s Christer Faleij reviewed the album on 1st March 1974, before the release of the album. Faleij gave a positive review in Swedish-language about the album; an &quot;incredibly professional production. Without necessarily making a fuss, it can be briefly stated that the quartet is still taking a giant leap towards the international market. It&#x27;s about streamlined, practical music with stylish vocals and driven arrangements. Quite in keeping with the style, it starts with &quot;Waterloo&quot; in Swedish and ends with the same song in English. In between, there are 10 tracks, of which at least a couple have as good a chance as &quot;Waterloo&quot; to really hit the spot. Personally, I believe &quot;Honey Honey&quot; will be another big seller. It would also have placed well in the Swedish selection. And &quot;Watch Out&quot; with its heavy accompaniment will also be a success. There are several themes running through the album: soft and heavy pop, a not-so-small nod to the Supremes in &quot;What About Livingstone&quot;, a hit in &quot;Hasta Mañana&quot;. Benny Andersson together with Björn Ulvaeus is responsible for most of the material. In three melodies, Stikkan Anderson has stepped in as a lyricist, All lyrics except the Swedish version of &quot;Waterloo&quot; are in English. The majority of the songs creep in and stay. They are simple, uncomplicated melody loops that are easy to understand. &quot;Waterloo&quot; has already passed the so-called gold mark, even though the album is not yet available in stores. This is through pre-orders. I think it will be very exciting for Swedish people in Brighton on April 6&quot;.

Reviews of the album were positive with &quot;Phonograph Record&quot;″s Greg Shaw stating that it &quot;might just turn out to be one of the classic début LPs of the &#x27;70s&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also gave the album a favourable review. In a 3-star review, Bruce Eder from AllMusic said that the album was &quot;unusual in the group&#x27;s output&quot; due to the &quot;variety of sounds&quot; and because &quot;the guys are still featured fairly prominently in some of the vocals&quot;. He wrote, in relation to &quot;King Kong Song&quot;, that &quot;when the women&#x27;s voices jump in on the choruses, it&#x27;s hard not to listen attentively; the quartet knew what a powerful weapon they had, but not quite how to use it&quot;.

<text>Where Are My Children? is a 1916 American silent drama film directed by Phillips Smalley and Lois Weber and stars Tyrone Power Sr., Juan de la Cruz, Helen Riaume, Marie Walcamp, Cora Drew, A.D. Blake, Rene Rogers, William Haben and C. Norman Hammond. The film tells the story of a district attorney (Power Sr.) who, while prosecuting a doctor for illegal abortions, finds out that society people, including his wife, used the doctor&#x27;s services.

==Plot==

Richard Walton, a district attorney, is presented with an obscenity case: A medical practitioner, Dr. Homer, has been arrested for distributing &#x27;indecent&#x27; birth control literature. On the stand, Dr. Homer makes a strong case for legalizing contraception. He recounts three incidents from his medical practice, each shown in a brief flashback: children are exposed to violent abuse in a family riddled with alcoholism; an impoverished family is unable to provide adequate medical care for their sick children; and a single mother, abandoned by her male lover, commits suicide with her young infant.

Meanwhile, Richard&#x27;s wife, Edith, has been keeping a secret from him for many years: she has been seeing a doctor, one Herman Malfit, who performs abortions so that her busy social life will not be interrupted by the inconvenience of pregnancy. She suggests it as an option for her friend Mrs. William Carlo, who is with child. Mrs. Carlo has the abortion.

The Waltons receive two new guests in their house almost simultaneously: Edith Walton&#x27;s ne&#x27;er-do-well younger brother, and their maid&#x27;s young daughter, Lillian. Smitten by the brother&#x27;s advances, the maid&#x27;s daughter is seduced and soon finds herself pregnant. She is taken to Dr. Malfit and then abandoned by the boy after the operation goes wrong. Making her way back to the Walton mansion, she collapses and dies from the botched abortion.

Following Malfit&#x27;s arrest and trial, Richard Walton examines the doctor&#x27;s ledgers and realized that his wife and many of her friends are listed as having received &#x27;personal services.&#x27; He returns home, furious, to find them lunching at his home. He banishes his wife&#x27;s friends, saying &#x27;I should bring you to trial for manslaughter!&#x27; and confronts Edith with the cry, &#x27;where are my children?&#x27; She is overcome with remorse. As the years pass, the couple must contend with a lonely, childless life, full of longing for the family they might have had.

==Cast==
==Themes==

The film was inspired by the 1914 obscenity case of Margaret Sanger in New York in which she was prosecuted for distributing information about birth control through the U.S. postal system. This had been made illegal by the 1873 Comstock Act, which defined birth control as obscene. It stands as one of the best surviving examples of Lois Weber&#x27;s social problem films.

Eugenics and family planning are discussed didactically in the film, and examples of desirable or undesirable children (the results of good or bad breeding respectively) are shown.

While the film presents an argument for birth control, it takes a firm stance against abortion, portraying the wealthy women as procuring abortions on a whim when pregnancy threatens to interfere with their social lives. According to some critics, the film also portrays abortion inaccurately, suggesting that it is inherently harmful to patients both physically and mentally. At the time Weber made the film, &#x27;back alley&#x27; and &#x27;illegal&#x27; abortions were prevalent and quite often resulted in destroying women&#x27;s ability to have future children. It is left clear at the film&#x27;s end Mrs. Walton can no longer have children because her body is damaged by a long-term overindulgence in abortions.

==Production==
The film was written by Lucy Payton, Franklin Hall, Lois Weber and Phillips Smalley. No director is credited. Future star Mary MacLaren made her debut in this film playing the Walton&#x27;s younger maid. Shooting took place in the Los Angeles area, and at the Universal studio facilities in Hollywood. The Waltons are played by Tyrone Power Sr. and Helen Riaume, who at the time were real life husband and wife. Anne Power, their daughter, has a small role.

The film makes use of several trick photography scenes, with an emphasis on multiple exposures to convey information or emotions visually. This is especially evident in the final scene of the film. As a recurring motif, every time a character becomes pregnant, a child&#x27;s face is double exposed over their shoulder.

Weber returned to the topic of birth control the following year, with a film called &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;, in which she plays the principal role of Louise Broome, a birth control advocate imprisoned for her work.

==Reception==
The film was widely viewed in the U.S. and made Lois Weber popular. It did well in New York City and in Manhattan, after a court case was dismissed and the film was allowed to be exhibited. In Atlantic City, the film played to packed houses. Critics praised the film for its delicate handling of sensitive subject matter and attention to detail and dramatic qualities. However, in Pennsylvania, the film was banned, even after several edited submissions to the censors. They felt that it was filth and no amount of editing could make the film fit for decent people to see.

==Preservation==
In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. A 2000 DVD release featured a reconstructed piano score written and performed by Martin Marks. A 2007 DVD release featured full orchestration of the Marks score, as arranged by Allen Feinstein, and expert audio commentary by film historian Shelley Stamp. A 2018 DVD/Blu-ray release featured a new piano score by Maud Nelissen.

<text>Saludos Amigos (Spanish for &quot;Greetings, Friends&quot;) is a 1942 American live-action/animated anthology film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Set in Latin America, it is made up of four different segments; Donald Duck stars in two of them and Goofy stars in one. It also features the first appearance of José Carioca, the malandro Brazilian parrot. &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943.

The film was a success, helping launch the international popularity of Donald Duck and leading Disney to produce &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; (1944), another government-funded film aimed at Latin American goodwill.

==Background==

In early 1941, before U.S. entry into World War II, the United States Department of State commissioned a Disney goodwill tour of South America, intended to lead to a movie to be shown in the US, Central, and South America as part of the Good Neighbor Policy. This was being done because several Latin American governments had close ties with Nazi Germany, and the US government wanted to counteract those ties. Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters were popular in Latin America, and Walt Disney acted as ambassador. The tour, facilitated by Nelson Rockefeller, who had recently been appointed as Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (CIAA), took Disney and a group of roughly twenty composers, artists, technicians, etc. from his studio to South America, mainly to Brazil and Argentina, but also to Chile, Bolivia and Peru.

The film itself was given federal loan guarantees, because the Disney studio had over-expanded just before European markets were closed to them by the war, and because Disney was struggling with labor unrest at the time (including a strike that was underway at the time the goodwill journey began).

The film included live-action documentary sequences featuring footage of modern Latin American cities with skyscrapers and fashionably dressed residents. This surprised many contemporary US viewers, who associated such images only with US and European cities, and contributed to a changing impression of Latin America. Film historian Alfred Charles Richard Jr. has commented that &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; &quot;did more to cement a community of interest between peoples of the Americas in a few months than the State Department had in fifty years.&quot;

The film also inspired Chilean cartoonist René Ríos Boettiger to create Condorito, one of Latin America&#x27;s most ubiquitous cartoon characters. Ríos perceived that the character &quot;Pedro&quot;, a small, incapable airplane, was a slight to Chileans and created a comic that could supposedly rival Disney&#x27;s comic characters.

==Film segments==
This film features four different segments, each of which begin with various clips of the Disney artists roaming the country, drawing cartoons of some of the local cultures and scenery they see.

===&quot;Lake Titicaca&quot;===
In this segment, the Disney artists make a cartoon where Donald Duck visits Lake Titicaca in Bolivia and Peru and meets some of the locals, including an obstinate llama as an American tourist. When Donald tries to ride the llama over a bridge, he ends up falling into the sea and rows away in pots and pans.

===&quot;Pedro&quot;===
&quot;Pedro&quot; is a story about a small anthropomorphic airplane from an airport near Santiago, Chile, engaging in his first flight to retrieve air mail from Mendoza, with disastrous consequences. He manages to safely return to the airfield with the mail, which happens to be a single postcard. RKO Pictures released this particular segment as a theatrical short on May 13, 1955.

Chilean cartoonist René Ríos Boettiger (known popularly as &quot;Pepo&quot;) was disappointed with how the character Pedro represented his country. In response, he developed the character &quot;Condorito&quot;, who went on to become one of the most iconic comic magazine characters in Latin America.

===&quot;El Gaucho Goofy&quot;===
In this segment, American cowboy Goofy gets taken from Texas to the Argentinian pampas by the Narrator to learn the ways of the native gaucho. This segment was later edited for the film&#x27;s Gold Classic Collection VHS/DVD release to remove one scene in which Goofy is shown smoking a cigarette. This edit appears again on the Classic Caballeros Collection DVD. This sequence has since been restored as the unedited version has been much requested. The fully unedited version is available as a bonus feature on the &quot;Walt &amp; El Grupo&quot; DVD release and fully unedited and restored on &quot;Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros 75th Anniversary Edition 2-Movie Collection&quot; Blu-ray. When the film was released on Disney&#x27;s streaming platform Disney+, the edited version of the sequence was used despite disclaimers of the film being presented in its original format with &quot;outdated cultural depictions&quot; and tobacco usage, but it has since been changed to the unedited version.

===&quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot;===
&quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;Watercolor of Brazil&quot;), the finale of the film, views Disney artists creating pictures that magically turn into different pictures. One of them is a flower, which turns into Donald Duck after a bee goes into his mouth. When the bee flies out of his mouth, Donald sees a paint brush creating a brand-new character, José Carioca from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who shows Donald Duck around South America, lets him have a drink of cachaça with him, which is so spicy for Donald that he starts hiccuping, and introduces him to the samba (to the tunes of &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; and &quot;Tico-Tico no Fubá&quot;). After that, the film ends.

== Music ==
The film&#x27;s original score was composed by Edward H. Plumb, Paul J. Smith, and Charles Wolcott. The title song, &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot;, was written for the film by Charles Wolcott and Ned Washington. The film also featured the song &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot;, written by the popular Brazilian songwriter Ary Barroso and performed by Aloísio de Oliveira, and an instrumental version of &quot;Tico-Tico no Fubá&quot;, written by Zequinha de Abreu. &quot;Aquarela do Brasil&quot; was written and first performed in 1939, but did not achieve much initial success. However, after appearing in this film it became an international hit, becoming the first Brazilian song to be played over a million times on American radio.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was first released by Decca Records in 1944 as a collection of three 78rpm singles.

<text>The Three Caballeros is a 1944 American live-action and animated musical propaganda anthology film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures. The film premiered in Mexico City on December 21, 1944. It was released in the United States on February 3, 1945 and in the United Kingdom in March 1945. It marks the tenth anniversary of Donald Duck and plots an adventure through parts of Latin America, combining live-action and animation. This is the second of the six package films released by Walt Disney Productions in the 1940s, following &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; (1942). It is also notable for being one of the first feature-length films to incorporate traditional animation with live-action actors.

The film is plotted as a series of self-contained segments, strung together by the device of Donald Duck opening birthday gifts from his Latin American friends. Several Latin American stars of the period appear, including singers Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen Miranda) and Dora Luz, as well as singer and dancer Carmen Molina.

The film was produced as part of the studio&#x27;s goodwill message for Latin America. The film stars Donald Duck, who in the course of the film is joined by old friend José Carioca, the cigar-smoking parrot from &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot;, who represents Brazil, and later becomes friends with a pistol-packing rooster named Panchito Pistoles, who represents Mexico.

== Plot ==
The film, celebrating Donald Duck&#x27;s 10th anniversary, consists of seven segments, each connected by a common theme. In the film, it is Donald Duck&#x27;s birthday (namely Friday the 13th), and he receives three presents from friends in Latin America. The first present is a film projector, which shows him a documentary about birds called . The first segment of the documentary tells the story of Pablo, a penguin seeking the warm weather of Equatorial South America. The next segment details some of the odd birds of Latin America. During this part of the documentary, he learns about the Aracuan Bird, who received his name because of his eccentric song. The documentary then shifts to the perspective of a man narrating a story from his childhood, where he discovers and befriends a donkey with the wings of a condor in Uruguay.

The next present is a book given to Donald by José, a native of Brazil. This book tells of Bahia (spelled &quot;Baía&quot; in the film), which is one of Brazil&#x27;s 26 states. José shrinks them both down so that they can enter the book. Donald and José meet up with several of the locals, who dance a lively samba, and Donald ends up pining for one girl Yaya, the cookie seller, but fails and gets jealous of another man. After the journey, Donald and José leave the book.

Upon returning, Donald realizes that he is too small to open his third present. José shows Donald how to use &quot;black magic&quot; to return himself to the proper size. After opening the present, he meets Panchito, a native of Mexico. The trio take the name &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; and have a short celebration. Panchito then presents Donald&#x27;s next present, a . Panchito tells Donald of the tradition behind the piñata. José and Panchito then blindfold Donald, and have him attempt to break open the piñata, eventually revealing many surprises. The celebration draws to a close when Donald is fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a ferocious toy bull (with which the firecrackers are lit by José with his cigar).

Throughout the film, the Aracuan Bird appears at random moments. He usually taunts everyone with his madcap antics, sometimes stealing José&#x27;s cigar and trying to make José jealous. His most famous gag is when he re-routes a train that Donald and José are riding on by drawing new tracks, causing the train to disassemble.

The film consists of seven segments:

=== &quot;The Cold-Blooded Penguin&quot; ===
This segment is narrated by Sterling Holloway, reproducing images of the penguins of in Antarctica. In the segment, a penguin named Pablo is so fed up with the freezing conditions of the South Pole that he decides to leave his home for warmer climates, navigating the long coast of Chile (including the Juan Fernández Islands and Viña del Mar), passing by Lima (the capital of Peru) and Quito (the capital of Ecuador) before landing on the Galápagos Islands.

=== &quot;The Flying Gauchito&quot; ===
This segment, with adult narration provided by Fred Shields, involves the adventures of a little boy from Uruguay and a winged donkey, who goes by the name of Burrito (which is Spanish for &quot;little donkey&quot;).

=== &quot;Baía&quot; ===

This segment involves a pop-up book trip through the Brazilian state of Bahia (spelled Baía in the film), as Donald and José meet up with some of the locals who dance a samba and Donald pining for one of the women, a cookie seller named Yaya (portrayed by singer Aurora Miranda), who later gives Donald a kiss after he gives her a bouquet of flowers.

=== &quot;Las Posadas&quot; ===
This is the story of a group of Mexican children who celebrated Christmas by re-enacting the journey of Mary, the mother of Jesus and Saint Joseph searching for room at the inn. meant &quot;inn&quot;, or &quot;shelter&quot;, and their parents told them &quot;no &quot; at each house until they came to one where they were offered shelter in a stable. This leads to festivities including the breaking of the , which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break his &quot;own&quot; as well.

=== &quot;Mexico: Pátzcuaro, Veracruz and Acapulco&quot; ===
Panchito gives Donald and José a tour of Mexico City and the country of Mexico on a flying sarape, or magic carpet. Several Mexican dances and songs are learned here. Later Donald pines for more women, tries to pursue every one he sees and gain return affections, but once more he fails every time and ends up kissing José while blindfolded.

=== &quot;You Belong to My Heart&quot; and &quot;Donald&#x27;s Surreal Reverie&quot; ===
The skies of Mexico City result in Donald falling in love with singer Dora Luz. The lyrics in the song itself play parts in the scenarios as well. Then several imagined kisses lead to Donald going into the &quot;Love is a drug&quot; scene. Donald constantly envisions sugar rush colors, flowers, and Panchito and José popping in at the worst moments, making chaos. The scene changes after Donald manages to dance with Carmen Molina from the state of Oaxaca, from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The two dance and sing the song . Carmen begins by singing the song, with Donald &quot;quacking&quot; out the rest of the chorus with her. The &quot;drunkenness&quot; slows down for a second after Donald multiplies himself while dancing, but speeds up again when Carmen reappears dressed in a Charro&#x27;s outfit and uses a horsewhip as a conductor&#x27;s baton to make cacti appear in many different forms while dancing to , a trademark song of the Mexican Revolution. This scene is notable for providing the masterful combination of live-action and cartoon animation, as well as animation among the cacti.

The scene is interrupted when Panchito and José suddenly spice things up for the finale of the film, and Donald ends up battling the same toy bull with wheels on its legs the day before from earlier. The catch is that it is now loaded with fireworks and other explosives, following with a fireworks finale with the words &quot;The End&quot; exploding from the fireworks, first in Spanish (), in the colors of the flag of Mexico, then the second in Portuguese (), in the colors of the flag of Brazil, and finally in English, in the colors of the flag of the United States (&quot;The End&quot;).

==Background==
The Good Neighbor policy was a campaign by the United States to improve its relations with Latin America. A special concern in the late 1930s was the mounting program of Nazi propaganda designed to increase Nazism in the Americas, which would weaken US control and divide the Americas. To counter the Nazis, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded in 1940–1941 the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs through which US propaganda efforts could be coordinated. Chief Coordinator Nelson Rockefeller asked Walt Disney to produce a few short films with themes friendly to Latin America, and Disney traveled to Brazil with a creative team to collect images and inspire ideas for such films.

The first Disney product of this propaganda program was the animated film &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; in 1942. This film introduced the character José Carioca—a Brazilian businessman taking the form of a parrot—who led Donald Duck around South America. The next major film was &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; which brought together Donald Duck, José Carioca, and a new character from Mexico: Panchito Pistoles, a gun-toting revolutionary rooster. These Disney films were much more successful than previous propaganda efforts.

==Release==

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; received mixed reviews upon its original release. Most critics were relatively perplexed by the &quot;technological razzle-dazzle&quot; of the film, thinking that, in contrast to the previous feature films up to this time, &quot;it displayed more flash than substance, more technique than artistry.&quot; Bosley Crowther for one wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Dizzy Disney and his playmates have let their technical talents run wild.&quot; Other reviewers were taken aback by the sexual dynamics of the film, particularly the idea of Donald Duck lusting towards flesh-and-blood women. As Wolcott Gibbs put it in a negative review of the film for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, such a concept &quot;is one of those things that might disconcert less squeamish authorities than the Hays office. It might even be said that a sequence involving the duck, the young lady, and a long alley of animated cactus plants would probably be considered suggestive in a less innocent medium.&quot;

The film holds an 84% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews, with an average score of 6.50/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;One of Disney&#x27;s more abstract creations, &quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; is a dazzling, colorful picture that shows the company at an artistic acme.&quot;

===Accolades===

<text>The Wild Bunch is a 1969 American epic revisionist Western film directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Ben Johnson and Warren Oates. The plot concerns an aging outlaw gang on the Mexico–United States border trying to adapt to the changing modern world of 1913. The film was controversial because of its graphic violence and its portrayal of crude men attempting to survive by any available means.

The screenplay was co-written by Peckinpah, Walon Green, and Roy N. Sickner. &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, in Mexico, notably at the Hacienda Ciénaga del Carmen, deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila, and on the Nazas River.

&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; is noted for intricate, multi-angle, quick-cut editing using normal and slow motion images, a revolutionary cinema technique in 1969. The writing of Green, Peckinpah, and Sickner was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, and the music by Jerry Fielding was nominated for Best Original Score. Additionally, Peckinpah was nominated for an Outstanding Directorial Achievement award by the Directors Guild of America, and cinematographer Lucien Ballard won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography.

Regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress in 1999 for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is ranked 79th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 best American films and the 69th most thrilling film. In 2008, the AFI listed 10 best films in 10 genres and ranked &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; as the sixth-best Western.

==Plot==
In 1913 Texas, Pike Bishop, the leader of a gang of aging outlaws, seeks to retire after a final robbery of silver from a railroad payroll office. Corrupt railroad agent Pat Harrigan has hired a posse of bounty hunters led by Pike&#x27;s former partner Deke Thornton, who ambush and kill more than half of Bishop&#x27;s gang in a bloody shootout, which also kills many innocent bystanders as Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway.

Pike rides off with the only survivors: his close friend Dutch Engstrom, brothers Lyle and Tector Gorch, the inexperienced Angel, and a fifth man blinded and mortally wounded by buckshot, who Pike mercy-kills. The loot from the robbery turns out to be worthless steel washers planted by Harrigan. Needing money, they head for Mexico accompanied by the cantankerous Freddie Sykes and cross the Rio Grande to the rural village where Angel was born. The village elder warns them about General Mapache, a vicious Huertista officer in the Mexican Federal Army, who has been stealing food and animals from local villages to support his campaign against the forces of Pancho Villa.

Pike&#x27;s gang ask the general for work at his headquarters in the town of Agua Verde. Angel spots his former lover Teresa in Mapache&#x27;s arms and shoots her dead, angering the general and nearly getting them killed, but Pike defuses the situation. Mapache offers gold to the gang to rob a U.S. Army train so Mapache can resupply his army&#x27;s dwindling stocks of ammunition and provide samples of American weapons to his German military adviser Commander Mohr.

Angel gives his share of the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and ammunition to a band of peasant rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely as planned until Thornton&#x27;s posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed and chases them to the Mexican border. The robbers blow up a trestle bridge spanning the Rio Grande as the posse tries to cross, dumping the entire posse into the river, but the exhausted posse continues their pursuit.
Pike, anticipating that Mapache might double-cross him, hides the goods and has his men sell them to Mapache in separate amounts. However, Mapache learns from Teresa&#x27;s mother that Angel stole some of the weapons and reveals this as Angel and Dutch deliver the last of the weapons. Angel desperately tries to escape, only to be captured and beaten. Mapache lets Dutch go after he states that Angel is a thief who deserves to be punished, and Dutch then tells Pike and the others what happened.

Sykes is wounded by Thornton&#x27;s posse while securing spare horses. Dutch criticizes Thornton for working with the railroad, but Pike says Thornton &quot;gave his word&quot; to the railroad and must see it through. Dutch angrily declares, &quot;That ain&#x27;t what counts, it&#x27;s who you give it to.&quot; Pike and the gang bury most of the gold and return to Agua Verde, where the townspeople and soldiers are drunkenly celebrating the weapons sale and Mapache is dragging Angel through town on a rope tied to the back of his car. Mapache refuses to sell Angel back to the gang, and after a period of reflection while visiting a brothel, Pike and the others arm themselves to rescue their friend by force.

Mapache initially agrees to release Angel, only to cut his throat at the last second. The gang instantly opens fire and guns down the general. While the nearby soldiers are frozen in shock, Pike calmly takes aim and kills Mohr. This begins a bloody gunfight that kills Pike, Dutch, the remaining gang members, Mohr&#x27;s aide, every member of Mapache&#x27;s staff, and most of the assembled troops.

Thornton arrives and finds Pike already dead. Thornton finds a loaded revolver on Pike&#x27;s belt and takes it as a sign that the days of men like him are over. Feeling outdated and tired, Thornton allows the remaining posse members to greedily strip Pike and his men of their possessions before taking them back to Texas for the bounty, while he stays behind. After some time, Sykes arrives with the elder from Angel&#x27;s village and a band of rebels, indicating that they caught up with the bounty hunters, avenged the gang&#x27;s deaths, and buried them properly. Sykes invites Thornton to join the coming revolution against the Mexican government. Thornton smiles and rides off with them.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
In April 1965, producer Reno Carrell optioned an original story and screenplay by Walon Green and Roy Sickner, called &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;.

In 1967, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts producers Kenneth Hyman and Phil Feldman were interested in having Sam Peckinpah rewrite and direct an adventure film called &quot;The Diamond Story&quot;. A professional outcast due to the production difficulties of his previous film, &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965), and his firing from the set of &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965), Peckinpah&#x27;s stock had improved following his critically acclaimed work on the television film &quot;Noon Wine&quot; (1966).

At the time, William Goldman&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; had recently been purchased by 20th Century Fox. An alternative screenplay available at the studio was &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. It was quickly decided that &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, which had several similarities to Goldman&#x27;s work, would be produced to beat &quot;Butch Cassidy&quot; to the theaters.

===Writing===
By the fall of 1967, Peckinpah was rewriting the screenplay and preparing for production. The principal photography was shot entirely on location in Mexico, most notably at the Hacienda Ciénega del Carmen (deep in the desert between Torreón and Saltillo, Coahuila) and on the Nazas River. Peckinpah&#x27;s epic work was inspired by his hunger to return to films, the violence seen in Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), America&#x27;s growing frustration with the Vietnam War, and what he perceived to be the utter lack of reality seen in Westerns up to that time.

He set out to make a film which portrayed not only the vicious violence of the period, but also the crude men attempting to survive the era. Multiple scenes attempted in &quot;Major Dundee&quot;, including slow motion action sequences (inspired by Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s work in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), characters leaving a village as if in a funeral procession, and the use of inexperienced locals as extras, would become fully realized in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;.

===Casting===

Peckinpah considered many actors for the Pike Bishop role before casting William Holden, including Richard Boone, Sterling Hayden, Charlton Heston, Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and James Stewart. Marvin actually accepted the role but pulled out after he was offered more money to star in &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot; (1969).

Peckinpah&#x27;s first two choices for the role of Deke Thornton were Richard Harris (who had co-starred in &quot;Major Dundee&quot;) and Brian Keith (who had worked with Peckinpah on &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Deadly Companions&quot; (1961)). Harris was never formally approached; Keith was asked, but he turned it down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah saw him in the World War II action movie &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967). Other actors considered for the role were Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Ben Johnson (later cast as Tector Gorch), and Arthur Kennedy.

The role of Mapache went to Emilio Fernández, the Mexican film director, writer, actor, and friend of Peckinpah. Among those considered to play Dutch Engstrom were Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Alex Cord, Robert Culp, Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Jaeckel, Steve McQueen, and George Peppard. Ernest Borgnine was cast based on his performance in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967). Robert Blake was the original choice to play Angel, but he asked for too much money. Peckinpah was impressed with Jaime Sánchez in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; and demanded that he be cast as Angel.

Stage actor Albert Dekker was cast as Harrigan the railroad detective. &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was his last film, as he died just months after its final scenes were completed. Bo Hopkins had only a few television credits on his resume when he played the part of Clarence &quot;Crazy&quot; Lee. Warren Oates played Lyle Gorch, having previously worked with Peckinpah on the TV series &quot;The Rifleman&quot; and his previous films &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; (1962) and &quot;Major Dundee&quot; (1965).

===Filming===

The film was shot with the anamorphic process. Peckinpah and his cinematographer, Lucien Ballard, also made use of telephoto lenses, that allowed for objects and people in both the background and foreground to be compressed in perspective. The effect is best seen in the shots where the Bunch makes the walk to Mapache&#x27;s headquarters to free Angel. As they walk forward, a constant flow of people passes between them and the camera; most of the people in the foreground are as sharply focused as the Bunch.

By the time filming wrapped, Peckinpah had shot of film with 1,288 camera setups. Lombardo and Peckinpah remained in Mexico for six months editing the picture. After initial cuts, the opening gunfight sequence ran 21 minutes. By cutting frames from specific scenes and intercutting others, they were able to fine-cut the opening robbery down to five minutes. The creative montage became the model for the rest of the film and would &quot;forever change the way movies would be made&quot;.

Peckinpah stated that one of his goals for the movie was to give the audience &quot;some idea of what it is to be gunned down&quot;. A memorable incident occurred, to that end, as Peckinpah&#x27;s crew were consulting him on the &quot;gunfire&quot; effects to be used in the film. Not satisfied with the results from the squibs his crew had brought for him, Peckinpah became exasperated and finally hollered: &quot;That&#x27;s not what I want! &quot;That&#x27;s not what I want!&quot;&quot; He then grabbed a real revolver and fired it into a nearby wall. The gun empty, Peckinpah barked at his stunned crew: &quot;THAT&#x27;S the effect I want!!&quot;

He also had the gunfire sound effects changed for the film. Before, all gunshots in Warner Bros. movies sounded identical, regardless of the type of weapon being fired. Peckinpah insisted that each different type of firearm have its own specific sound effect when fired.

===Editing===
The editing of the film is notable in that shots from multiple angles were spliced together in rapid succession, often at different speeds, placing greater emphasis on the chaotic nature of the action and the gunfights.

Lou Lombardo, having previously worked with Peckinpah on &quot;Noon Wine&quot;, was personally hired by the director to edit &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo&#x27;s youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions.

One of Lombardo&#x27;s first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series &quot;Felony Squad&quot; he had edited in 1967. The episode, entitled &quot;My Mommy Got Lost&quot;, included a slow motion sequence where Joe Don Baker is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second, but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second. Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: &quot;Let&#x27;s try some of that when we get down to Mexico!&quot; The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second. When the scenes were eventually cut together, the action would shift from slow to fast to slower still, giving time an elastic quality never before seen in motion pictures up to that time.

Further editing was done to secure a favorable rating from the MPAA, which was in the process of establishing a new set of codes. Peckinpah and his editors cut the film to satisfy the new, expansive R-rating parameters which, for the first time, designated a film as being unsuitable for children. Without this new system in place, the film could not have been released with its explicit images of bloodshed.

==Themes==
Critics of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; note the theme of the end of the outlaw gunfighter era. For example, the character Pike Bishop advises: &quot;We&#x27;ve got to start thinking beyond our guns. Those days are closing fast.&quot; The Bunch lives by an anachronistic code of honor that is out of place in 20th-century society. Also, when the gang inspects Mapache&#x27;s new automobile, they perceive it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Ride the High Country&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Ballad of Cable Hogue&quot; (1970).

The violence that was much criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: &quot;The point of the film is to take this façade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it&#x27;s not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it&#x27;s ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it&#x27;s not fun and games and cowboys and Indians. It&#x27;s a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there&#x27;s a certain response that you get from it, an excitement, because we&#x27;re all violent people.&quot; Peckinpah used violence as a catharsis, believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, observing that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films&#x27; violence, which troubled him.

Betrayal is the secondary theme of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. The characters suffer from their knowledge of having betrayed a friend and left him to his fate, thus violating their own honor code when it suits them (&quot;$10,000 cuts an awful lot of family ties&quot;). However, Bishop says, &quot;When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can&#x27;t do that you&#x27;re like some animal.&quot; Such oppositional ideas lead to the film&#x27;s violent conclusion, as the remaining men find their abandonment of Angel intolerable. Bishop remembers his betrayals, most notably when he deserts Deke Thornton, in flashback, when the law catches up to them and when he abandons Crazy Lee at the railroad office after the robbery, ostensibly to guard the hostages. Critic David Weddle writes that &quot;like that of Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Lord Jim&quot;, Pike Bishop&#x27;s heroism is propelled by overwhelming guilt and a despairing death wish.&quot;

==Release==
The film opened on June 18, 1969, at the Pix theatre in Los Angeles and grossed $39,200 in its first week. Produced on a budget of $6 million, the film grossed $10.5 million at the US box office in 1970 and another $638,641 in the US on its 1995 restored box-office release, making a total of $11,138,641. It was the 17th highest-grossing film of 1969.

===Versions===
There have been several versions of the film:
* The original, 1969 European release is 145 minutes long, with an intermission (per the distributor&#x27;s request, before the train robbery)
* The original, 1969 American release is 143 minutes long
* The second, 1969 American release is 135 minutes long, shortened to allow more screenings
* The 1995 re-release (labeled &quot;The Original Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, available in home video) is 145 minutes long and identical to the 1969 European release

In 1993, Warner Bros. resubmitted the film to the MPAA ratings board prior to an expected re-release. To the studio&#x27;s surprise, the originally R-rated film was re-rated NC-17, which delayed the release until the decision was appealed. The controversy was linked to 10 extra minutes added to the film, although none of this footage contained graphic violence. Warner Bros. trimmed some footage to decrease the running time to ensure additional daily screenings. When the restored film finally made it to the screen in March 1995, one reviewer noted:

By restoring 10 minutes to the film, the complex story now fits together in a seamless way, filling in those gaps found in the previous theatrical release, and proving that Peckinpah was firing on all cylinders for this, his grandest achievement. ... And the one overwhelming feature that the director&#x27;s cut makes unforgettable are the many faces of the children, whether playing, singing, or cowering, much of the reaction to what happens on-screen is through the eyes, both innocent and imitative, of all the children.

Almost all of the versions of the film include the missing scenes. Warner Bros. released a newly restored version in a two-disc special edition on January 10, 2006. It includes an audio commentary by Peckinpah scholars, two documentaries concerning the making of the film (one of them is the Oscar-nominated &quot;The Wild Bunch: An Album in Montage&quot;), and never-before-seen outtakes.

==Critical reception==
Critical reaction in New York was mixed, with four reviewers with favorable reviews and three with unfavorable opinions, although there was debate as to whether the &quot;New York Post&quot; Archer Winsten&#x27;s review was mostly favorable despite asking &quot;was this violence necessary?&quot;. Vincent Canby began his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by calling the film &quot;very beautiful and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It&#x27;s also so full of violence—of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story—that it&#x27;s going to prompt a lot of people who do not know the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it.&quot; He observed, &quot;Although the movie&#x27;s conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat&quot;. About the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: &quot;After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he&#x27;s always done, not because he really wants the money but because there&#x27;s simply nothing else to do.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; also liked Holden&#x27;s performance, describing it as his best since &quot;Stalag 17&quot; (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar), noting Robert Ryan gave &quot;the screen performance of his career&quot;, and concluding that &quot;&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; contains faults and mistakes&quot; (such as flashbacks &quot;introduced with surprising clumsiness&quot;), but &quot;its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers.&quot;

William Wolf for &quot;Cue&quot; magazine found no merit in the film and gave it a two sentence dismissal and Judith Crist of &quot;New York&quot; magazine was also negative about the film.

In a 2002 retrospective Roger Ebert, who &quot;saw the original version at the world premiere in 1969, during the golden age of the junket, when Warner Bros. screened five of its new films in the Bahamas for 450 critics and reporters&quot;, said that, back then, he had publicly declared the film a masterpiece during the junket&#x27;s press conference, prompted by comments from &quot;a reporter from the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; [who] got up to ask &#x27;Why was this film ever made?&#x27;&quot; He compared the film to &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;: &quot;praised and condemned with equal vehemence.&quot;

&quot;What &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was to movie lovers in 1941, &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was to cineastes in 1969,&quot; wrote film critic Michael Sragow, who added that Peckinpah had &quot;produced an American movie that equals or surpasses the best of Kurosawa: the Gotterdammerung of Westerns&quot;.

Today, the film holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 8.8/10 based on reviews from 66 critics with its consensus stating, &quot;&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; is Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s shocking, violent ballad to an old world and a dying genre&quot;.

&quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was cited as cinematographer Roger Deakins&#x27;s favorite film, and film director Kathryn Bigelow named it as one of her five favorite films. In the 2012 BFI &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; poll for The Greatest Films of All Time, &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; received 27 votes from critics and directors such as Michael Mann, Paul Schrader and Edgar Wright.

==Documentary==
Sam Peckinpah and the making of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; were the subjects of the documentary &quot;The Wild Bunch: An Album in Montage&quot; (1996) directed and edited by Paul Seydor. The documentary was occasioned by the discovery of 72 minutes of silent, black-and-white film footage of Peckinpah and company on location in northern Mexico during the filming of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Michael Sragow wrote in 2000 that the documentary was &quot;a wonderful introduction to Peckinpah&#x27;s radically detailed historical film about American outlaws in revolutionary Mexico—a masterpiece that&#x27;s part bullet-driven ballet, part requiem for Old West friendship and part existential explosion. Seydor&#x27;s movie is also a poetic flight on the myriad possibilities of movie directing.&quot; Seydor and his co-producer Nick Redman were nominated in 1997 for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).

==Remake==
In 2005, David Ayer was reported to be in final negotiations to direct and write a remake of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;. Jerry Weintraub would produce and Mark Vahradian would executive produce. The remake would be a modern reinterpretation of the original, involving heists, drug cartels and the CIA.

On January 19, 2011, it was announced by Warner Bros. that a remake of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; was in the works. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland was hired to develop a new script. The 2012 suicide of Tony Scott, who was scheduled to direct, put the project in limbo.

On May 15, 2013, &quot;The Wrap&quot; reported that Will Smith was in talks to star in and produce the remake. The new version would involve drug cartels and follows a disgraced DEA agent who assembles a team to go after a Mexican drug lord and his fortune. No director has been chosen, and a new screenwriter is being sought.

In 2015, a Hollywood insider website announced that Jonathan Jakubowicz was set to write and direct a remake. &quot;Our sources also tell us that the remake will update the story to a contemporary setting, revolving around the CIA, dangerous drug cartels, and a thrilling heist against the backdrop of the Southern California-Mexico border. Jakubowicz will be working from previous drafts submitted by David Ayer and Brian Helgeland.&quot;

In 2018, it was announced that Mel Gibson would co-write and direct a new version of &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;.

<doc id="76631" wikidata="Q931978" url="?curid=76631" title="Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?">
<text>Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? is a 1957 American satirical comedy film starring Jayne Mansfield and Tony Randall, with Betsy Drake, Joan Blondell, John Williams, Henry Jones, Lili Gentle, and Mickey Hargitay, and with a cameo by Groucho Marx. The film is a satire on popular fan culture, Hollywood hype, and the advertising industry, which was profiting from commercials on the relatively new medium of television. It also takes aim at the reduction television caused to the size of movie theater audiences in the 1950s. The film was known as Oh! For a Man! in the United Kingdom.

The film was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin, who also wrote the largely original screenplay, using little more than the title and the character of Rita Marlowe from the successful Broadway play &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; by George Axelrod. The play had run from 1955 to 1956 and also starred Jayne Mansfield as Rita.

==Plot==
Struggling writer Rockwell P. Hunter is low rung of the ladder at the La Salle advertising agency. With the agency set to lose its biggest account — Stay-Put Lipstick — he hatches an idea to get the perfect model and spokeswoman for Stay-Put&#x27;s new line of lipstick: famous actress Rita Marlowe. Fortunately, his teenage niece April — a huge fan of Rita — knows where Rita is staying in New York.

For Rita to endorse the lipstick, however, Rock has to act as her boyfriend to make her real boyfriend, TV actor Bobo Branigansky, jealous. Bobo leaks the news of Rita&#x27;s new romance in a TV interview and Rock is suddenly famous as her &quot;Lover Doll&quot;.

Rock&#x27;s boss decides to leverage his employee&#x27;s newfound fame, but when Rock gets Rita to agree on a television special sponsored by Stay-Put, Rock becomes the agency&#x27;s highest-regarded employee. The two agree to continue this mutually beneficial relationship, garnering media attention for Rita and business for Rock. Rita, meanwhile, is miserable, as she is not over her one real true love, George Schmidlap, the man who discovered her. Unable to find Schmidlap, she pursues Rock, though her secretary Vi warns her that she is playing a dangerous game. Meanwhile, Rock&#x27;s angry fiancée Jenny is jealous, and in a bid to get back his attention, starts dressing and talking like Rita, much to Rock&#x27;s frustration.

Rock soon realizes that fame is a double-edged sword; it brings him what he desires, but at a cost. While women admire him, he struggles to find peace of mind. In the end, he climbs the corporate ladder and becomes the company president, only to realize that it is not what he truly wanted. Rock tells Jenny that achieving this success has left him feeling empty, and she decides to take him back.

As Rita opens her television special for Stay-Put, she is surprised by the appearance of the show&#x27;s guest star (her one true love), George Schmidlap. The two kiss and reunite.

Freed from the strain of advertising, Rock and Jenny retire to the country to tend a chicken farm, announcing that he has found the real &quot;living end&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; received a nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Actor – Musical/Comedy (Tony Randall) and a nomination for the Writers Guild of America, East WGA Award (Screen) for Best Written American Comedy (Frank Tashlin). Initially, Tashlin envisioned Ed Sullivan for the role of Rockwell P. Hunter. Sullivan turned it down, so Tony Randall was awarded the part.

The film contains joking references to several of Mansfield&#x27;s other roles, including &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1956; also directed by Tashlin), &quot;Kiss Them for Me&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Wayward Bus&quot; (1957). The book Rita Marlowe reads in the bathtub scene is &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1956) by Grace Metalious, which became a feature film and a popular TV series. The buxom characters in the book were claimed to have been inspired by Mansfield. Joan Blondell, who was herself a major movie sex symbol some 30 years before (her sexuality being an early target of the Hays Code), was cast as Mansfield&#x27;s frumpy, middle-aged, all-business secretary.

Former silent film star Minta Durfee has an uncredited role as a scrubwoman.

Randall is featured at the beginning of the film playing the drums, a trumpet, and a cello during the 20th Century-Fox logo and fanfare sequence. At the end, he remarks, &quot;Oh, the fine print they put in an actor&#x27;s contract these days!&quot; He also performs a comedic intermission midway through the film, which he says is for the audience used to television break.

In lieu of a theme song and opening of the film, Tashlin instead laid traditional opening credits over faux television commercials for products that failed to deliver what they promised.

==Legacy==
&quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; is known as Mansfield&#x27;s &quot;signature film&quot;. In 1966 Frank Tashlin said it was the film of his with which he was &quot;most satisfied... there was no compromise on that one. Buddy Adler let me do it my own way.&quot;

No less than ten television shows had episodes parodying the title of the film, usually substituting a series&#x27; character&#x27;s name in place of Rock Hunter. Among the series who did so were The Munsters, My Three Sons, and The Bullwinkle Show. 

There is a reference to this film in the film of the 1964 spy novel &quot;Funeral in Berlin&quot;, starring Michael Caine as Harry Palmer. When the secret agent Palmer gets forged papers with a new identity, he is dissatisfied with the name given to him and complains, &quot;Rock Hunter! Why can&#x27;t I be Rock Hunter?&quot;

In 2000, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 88% of 24 critics have given the film a positive review. James Powers of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film as &quot;social satire at its most penetrating&quot; with a focus on &quot;the inanities of TV&quot; and on the mainstream notion of success itself. Powers wrote: &quot;The joy of Tashlin&#x27;s parable is so funny that you don&#x27;t feel the blow until you see the bruise. You are laughing at some very silly people that you do not realize until much later very much resemble you.&quot; Powers even claimed that the unconventional opening titles &quot;could stand by themselves as among the funniest sequences ever filmed.&quot; Picturegoer called the film &quot;the most savage debunking&quot; of television to date, claiming Hollywood &quot;cut its home-screen rival down to size.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called it one of the funniest films of the year, noting how effective Frank Tashlin&#x27;s &quot;one-man band&quot; approach was to the production: &quot;Producer Tashlin obviously was determined to shoot the works for director Tashlin who in turn knew how to handle the scripter Tashlin.&quot;

Film critic Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Tashlin&#x27;s script as lacking &quot;substance and cohesion,&quot; claiming that the satire failed to prove movie entertainment as superior to television. In his review, Crowther wrote: &quot;People who live in glass houses should not throw stones at their television sets, no matter how scornful and superior they may feel toward video. The rocks may miss the vexing targets and crash through their own fragile walls. This axiom is clearly demonstrated in the flimsy motion picture that has been made from the flimsy stage play &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;&quot;. He also criticized Mansfield&#x27;s portrayal of Rita Marlowe, a character meant to impersonate Marilyn Monroe, calling the portrayal a &quot;travesty.&quot;

Variety magazine praised the film, calling it &quot;a vastly amusing comedy&quot; and favorably noted that Mansfield did &quot;a sock job&quot; in the starring role. &quot;

Ethan de Seife wrote in his book, &quot;Tashlinesque: The Hollywood Comedies of Frank Tashlin&quot;, that we see with &quot;Son of Paleface&quot;, &quot;Marry Me Again&quot;, &quot;Artists and Models&quot;, &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;, &quot;The Man from the Diners&#x27; Club&quot;, &quot;The Private Navy of Sergeant O&#x27;Farrell&quot;, and many others that American animation and American live-action comedy derive from the same tradition. Peter Lev wrote in his book, &quot;Twentieth Century-Fox: The Zanuck-Skouras Years, 1935–1965&quot;, &quot;&quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; is more fragmented than &quot;The Girl Can&#x27;t Help It&quot;, and paradoxically it makes it a better film.&quot;

<text>The Jetsons is an American animated sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. It originally aired in prime time from September 23, 1962, to March 17, 1963, on ABC, then later aired in reruns via syndication, with new episodes produced from 1985 to 1987. It was Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s Space Age counterpart to &quot;The Flintstones&quot;.

While the Flintstones lived in a world which was a comical version of the Stone Age, with machines powered by birds and dinosaurs, the Jetsons live in a comical version of a century in the future, with elaborate robotic contraptions, aliens, holograms, and whimsical inventions.

The original had 24 episodes and aired on Sunday nights on ABC beginning on September 23, 1962, with prime time reruns continuing through September 22, 1963. It debuted as the first program broadcast in color on ABC, back in the early 1960s when only a handful of ABC stations were capable of broadcasting in color. In contrast, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, while always produced in color, was broadcast in black-and-white for its first two seasons.

The show was originally scheduled opposite &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; and &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; and did not receive much attention. Due to poor ratings, it was cancelled after its first season but was then moved to Saturday mornings, where it went on to be very successful. Following its primetime run, the show aired on Saturday mornings for decades, starting on ABC for the 1963–64 season and then on CBS and NBC. New episodes were produced for syndication from 1985 to 1987. No further specials or episodes of the show were produced after 1989, as the majority of the core cast (George O&#x27;Hanlon, Mel Blanc, and Daws Butler) had died in 1988 and 1989. The 1990 film &quot;&quot; served as the series finale to the television show, though it failed to achieve critical and commercial success.

==Premise==
In the future, the Jetsons are a family residing in Orbit City. The city&#x27;s architecture is rendered in the Googie style and all homes and businesses are raised high above the ground on adjustable columns to avoid the pollutions from below. George Jetson lives with his family in the Skypad Apartments: his wife Jane is a homemaker, their teenage daughter Judy attends Orbit High School, and their son Elroy attends Little Dipper School. Housekeeping is performed by a robot maid named Rosie, who handles chores not otherwise rendered trivial by the home&#x27;s numerous push-button Space Age-envisioned conveniences. The family has a dog named Astro that talks with an initial consonant mutation in which every word begins with an &quot;R&quot;, as if speaking with a growl; a similar effect would also be used for Scooby-Doo.

George Jetson&#x27;s work week consists of an hour a day, two days a week. His boss is Cosmo Spacely, the bombastic owner of Spacely Space Sprockets. Spacely has a competitor, Mr. Cogswell, owner of the rival company Cogswell Cogs (sometimes known as Cogswell&#x27;s Cosmic Cogs). Jetson commutes to work in an aerocar with a transparent bubble top. Daily life is leisurely, assisted by numerous labor-saving devices, which occasionally break down with humorous results. Despite this, everyone complains of exhausting hard labor and difficulties living with the remaining inconveniences.

==Production==

The first season for the series was produced and directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. When Warner Bros. Cartoons closed in May 1961, several of its animators, including Gerry Chiniquy and Ken Harris, joined Hanna-Barbera to work on the first season.

==Morey Amsterdam and Pat Carroll controversy==
In 1963, Morey Amsterdam and Pat Carroll each filed $12,000 suits against Hanna-Barbera for breach of contract, claiming they had been cast and signed to the roles of George Jetson and Jane Jetson, respectively. Although their contracts stipulated they would be paid US$500 an episode with a guarantee of twenty-four episodes (i.e., a full season) of work, they recorded only one episode before being replaced. Several sources claimed the change had occurred as a result of sponsor conflict between Amsterdam&#x27;s commitment to &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and Carroll&#x27;s to &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;. The case had been closed by early 1965. In a 2013 interview, Pat Carroll indicated that the court had ruled in favor of Hanna-Barbera.

==Episodes==


&quot;The Jetsons&quot; original aired at primetime on ABC. It was a commercial failure in its first season and was negatively reviewed according to Bob Hathcock. Reruns were aired on CBS in 1963, and NBC from 1964 to 1967. It was brought back to NBC&#x27;s schedule in 1971, and ongoing when 41 new episodes were ordered.

In 1984, Hanna-Barbera began producing new episodes specifically for syndication; by September 1985, the 24 episodes from the first season were combined with 41 new episodes and began airing in morning or late afternoon time slots in 80 U.S. media markets, including the 30 largest. The 41 new episodes were produced at a cost of $300,000 each, and featured all of the voice actors from the 1962–1963 show. During 1987, 10 additional &quot;season 3&quot; episodes were also made available for syndication.

===Broadcast history===
Following its prime time cancellation, ABC placed reruns of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; on its Saturday morning schedule for the 1963–1964 season. The program would spend the next two decades on Saturday mornings, with subsequent runs on CBS (1964–65 and 1969–71) and NBC (1965–67; 1971–76; 1979–81 and 1982–83). &quot;The Jetsons&quot; began airing in syndication in September 1976, and these runs continued after the program returned to NBC&#x27;s Saturday morning schedule. Along with fellow Hanna-Barbera production &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; and Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; shorts, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; is one of the few series to have aired on each of the Big Three television networks in the United States.

On February 21, 2021, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; began airing on MeTV.

==Theme song==
The series&#x27; theme song, by composer Hoyt Curtin, became a pop hit in 1986.

==Science fiction themes==
Animation historian Christopher P. Lehman considers that the series shares its main science fiction theme with &quot;Funderful Suburbia&quot; (1962), a &quot;Modern Madcaps&quot; animated short. Both feature people involved in space colonization. However, there is a key difference in the nature of the colonization: in &quot;Funderful Suburbia&quot;, humans colonize outer space in order to escape the problems of planet Earth, while the Jetsons live in a place where space colonization is already established. Life in outer space is depicted as a fact of life, and the reasons behind humanity&#x27;s takeover of outer space are never explained.

Lehman argues that the series offers no explanation for its science fiction premise and does not directly satirize the social problems of any era. The setting is combined with standard sitcom elements, which serve as the series&#x27; main focus.

Smithsonian&#x27;s Matt Novak, in an article called &quot;Why The Show Still Matters&quot; asserts, &quot;Today &quot;The Jetsons&quot; stands as the single most important piece of 20th century futurism.&quot;

Novak continues, &quot;It&#x27;s easy for some people to dismiss &quot;The Jetsons&quot; as just a TV show, and a lowly cartoon at that. But this little show—for better and for worse—has had a profound impact on the way that Americans think and talk about the future.&quot;

==Reception==
After the announcement of the fall 1962 network television schedule &quot;Time&quot; magazine characterized &quot;The Jetsons&quot; as one of several new situation comedies (along with &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Dickens... He&#x27;s Fenster&quot;, and &quot;Our Man Higgins&quot;) that was &quot;stretching further than ever for their situations&quot;; after all the season&#x27;s new shows had premiered—a season &quot;responding to Minow&#x27;s exhortations&quot;—the magazine called the series &quot;silly and unpretentious, corny and clever, now and then quite funny.&quot; Almost all of the new sitcoms disappeared at the end of the season; only &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; would be renewed for new episodes in 1963–64, while &quot;The Jetsons&quot; would continue in Saturday morning reruns, eventually leading to its 1980s revival.

Thirty years later, &quot;Time&quot; wrote: &quot;In an age of working mothers, single parents and gay matrimony (same-sex marriage), George Jetson and his clan already seem quaint even to the baby boomers who grew up with them.&quot; In contrast, economist Jeffrey A. Tucker wrote in 2011 that &quot;The Jetsons&quot; is &quot;distinguished in science-fiction lore by
the fact that it is a rare attempt in this genre that actually succeeds in predicting the future.&quot; Apart from flying cars, which are as yet unfeasible in the real world (&quot;a lot of fun, until that first accident occurs&quot;), much of the technology of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; has become commonplace: people now communicate via video chat on flat screens; domestic robots such as the Roomba are widespread, and various high-tech devices are used for leisure. Tucker notes that &quot;The Jetsons&quot; depicts neither a grim dystopia nor an idyllic utopia, but rather a world where capitalism and entrepreneurship still exist and technology has not changed fundamental elements of human nature.

In 2017, Devon Maloney from &quot;The Verge&quot; described the show as a &quot;bone-chilling dystopia&quot;, stating how a reboot-comic book revealed that an environmental apocalypse caused humans to seek refuge in aerial cities. Maloney also notes the lack of people of color in the show and theorizes how discrimination against impoverished groups and developing countries could&#x27;ve taken place, stating &quot;though long held up as the quintessential utopia, &quot;The Jetsons&quot; is a perfect dystopia, built on the corpses of a billions-strong underclass deemed unworthy of a life in the clouds.&quot;

==Differences between versions==

Added characters:
* In the first episode of the 1980s episodes, an alien named Orbitty joined the family after Elroy discovered him on a field trip to an asteroid. Orbitty speaks in his own garbled dialect, has coil springs for legs, and changes colors according to his mood.
* Various appliances appear in the 1980s episodes such as Memo-Minder and Di-Di, Judy&#x27;s diary, which is shaped like a giant pair of wax lips.

Other differences include the following:
* The original 1960s episodes are distinguished by 1960s design motifs, music, and references (similar to &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and other Hanna-Barbera shows of that period). The 1980s version had a custom soundtrack with new sound-effects created by synthesizer.
* Whereas the 1960s stories were basically 1950s sitcom plots in a setting, the 1980s stories delved into fantastic, sci-fi cartoon territory.
* The 1960s version was more adult-oriented than the 1980s version, which was aimed at younger viewers.
* The 1980s opening credits contain a re-recorded version of the original &quot;Jetsons&quot; theme song, which features the use of synthesized drums and synth lead tracks typical of 1980s music.
* The 1960s closing credits were similar to the closing credits scenes from &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, which feature the family getting ready for bed as well as a disaster with their pets. In &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, George is walking Astro on a treadmill, Astro chases a cat, and then both animals jumping off after the treadmill malfunctions leaving Jetson running for his life. The 1980s version had to accommodate a larger production staff, including dozens of voice actors, and this closing credits segment was replaced with static multicolored backgrounds with pictures of The Jetsons arranged next to numerous credits. The 1960s episodes were rereleased with the redesigned closing segment (containing fewer production staff credits than the 1980s episodes, but has more names than the original closing scene which left several people uncredited) but are usually seen rebroadcast with their original credits segment.
* The 1960s episodes do not contain title cards. When the 1980s episodes were made, title cards were also made for the 1960s episodes, which explains the appearance of Orbitty in the title cards of the 1960s episodes. (Orbitty also appears in the 1980s closing credits, which style was also used for the 1960s episodes.)
* Many of the 1980s episodes were colored and composited using computer animation technology including digital ink and paint, rather than the more traditional ink and paint on cels.
* The backgrounds in the 1980s version contain vivid colors, and are more detailed than the 1960s version.
* While the 1960s episodes referenced rockets and other &quot;space age&quot; theme devices, reflective of the real-life American space program which fascinated the United States, the 1980s episodes leaned more towards how computers would influence life in outer space.
* In the 1980s version, Rosie the Robot appears more often than in the 1960s (when she only appeared in two episodes). Astro is also featured more prominently.
* The original spelling of Rosie&#x27;s name is &quot;Rosey&quot;, as featured in the 1962 premiere &quot;Rosey the Robot&quot;. Her spelling was modified to &quot;Rosie&quot;, as featured in the 1985 episode &quot;Rosie Come Home&quot;.
* Instead of the buttons, knobs, dials, and switches in the 1960s version, the 1980s version uses flat buttons and brightly lit consoles.
* The 1960s episodes were fitted with a laugh track (as was &quot;The Flintstones&quot;); the 1980s episodes were not.
* Many of the 1980s episodes were released in stereo sound, a first for series starring classic Hanna-Barbera characters.

==Proposed continuations and reboots==

A 1974 proposal would have created a sequel series to &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, set roughly ten years after the original series. CBS rejected the proposal and it was retooled into &quot;Partridge Family 2200 A.D.&quot;

Paramount Pictures first tried to film a live-action version of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; in 1985, which was to be executive produced by Gary Nardino, but failed to do so. In the late 1980s, Universal Pictures purchased the film rights for &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot; from Hanna-Barbera Productions. The result was &quot;&quot;, which was released in 1990. In November 2001, screenwriting duo Paul Foley and Dan Forman were brought onboard to revise a screenplay, with Rob Minkoff attached as director and Denise Di Novi as producer.

On March 18, 2003, it was announced that the script was again being reworked, with Adam Shankman entering negotiations to direct and co-write the film. In June 2004, with Shankman still onboard as director, Di Novi confirmed that the latest draft was penned by Sam Harper. By May 2006, the project was re-launched with Adam F. Goldberg confirmed as the new screenwriter, and Donald De Line was added as producer alongside Di Novi.

In May 2007, director Robert Rodriguez entered talks with Universal Studios and Warner Bros. to film a CGI adaptation of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; for a potential 2009 theatrical release, having at the time discussed directing a film adaptation of &quot;Land of the Lost&quot; with Universal. Rodriguez was uncertain which project he would pursue next, though the latest script draft for &quot;The Jetsons&quot; by Goldberg was further along in development.

In January 2012, recording artist Kanye West was mistakenly reported as creative director over the project, though West clarified on social media that &quot;I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson [&quot;sic&quot;] movie and someone on the call yelled out.. you should do a Jetsons tour!&quot; Longtime producer Denise Di Novi denied the confirmed involvement stating negotiations with West via conference call was merely &quot;preliminary and exploratory and introductory&quot;. In February 2012, Warner Bros. hired Van Robichaux and Evan Susser to rewrite the script.

On January 23, 2015, it was announced that Warner Bros. is planning a new animated &quot;Jetsons&quot; feature film, with Matt Lieberman to provide the screenplay. As of May 25, 2017, Conrad Vernon will direct the film.

On August 17, 2017, ABC ordered a pilot for a live-action sitcom version of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; to be written by Gary Janetti and executive produced by Janetti, Jack Rapke and Robert Zemeckis.

===Home media===
In 1990, Hanna-Barbera Home Video released six episodes from the show on videocassette. Warner Home Video released season 1 on DVD in Region 1 on May 11, 2004; upon its release, James Poniewozik wrote that it is &quot;as much about New Frontier 1962 as about the distant future. Its ditzy slapstick is like the peanut-butter-and-jelly mix Goober Grape—if you didn&#x27;t love it as a kid, you&#x27;re not going to acquire the taste as an adult—and the pop-culture gags ... have not aged well. But the animation is still a classic of gee-whiz atomic-age modernism.&quot;

The review of the DVD release from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said the show &quot;trots through surprisingly dated sitcom plots about blustery bosses, bad lady drivers, and Elvis Presleyesque teen idols, all greeted with laugh tracks&quot; but points out &quot;it&#x27;s the appeal of the retro-prescient gadgets (recliner massagers, big-screen TVs, two-way monitors) that still carries the show.&quot; Season 1 was released on DVD in Region 4 on July 5, 2006. Season Two, Volume 1 was released on DVD almost three years later, on June 2, 2009, for Region 1.

On November 8, 2011, Warner Home Video (via the Warner Archive Collection) released &quot;The Jetsons: Season 2, Volume 2&quot; on DVD in Region 1 as part of their Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner&#x27;s online store and Amazon.com. Warner Archive followed up by releasing Season 3 in the same way on May 13, 2014.

The complete ABC series was released on Blu-ray on September 10, 2019, by Warner Home Video (again via the Warner Archive Collection), sourced from new 2K scans of the original broadcast masters while maintaining the show&#x27;s original 4:3 aspect ratio.

==Legacy==
William S Higgins writing for &quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; noted that the show &quot;has become a popular metonym for &#x27;the future&#x27;. While satirizing Space Age notions of a better tomorrow, the series seems also to have visually codified expectations of the future to a great many viewers: when the twenty-first century arrived, complaints that flying cars and jet packs were missing often mentioned &quot;The Jetsons&quot;.&quot;.

The show influenced the turn-of-the-millennium show &quot;Futurama&quot;, which made a number of references to &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, or reused its tropes.

Boomerang has aired reruns of the show since April 1, 2000. Cartoon Network aired the show from 1992 to 2004 and returned the series October 2012. Also, some of the 1980s episodes were available for viewing on In2TV prior to its shutdown; these episodes were later moved to the online version of Kids&#x27; WB. Also the first two seasons of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; are available to download on Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Network, Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store and at the Xbox Live Marketplace. The Kids&#x27; WB website eventually shut down in 2015, however, the Kids&#x27; WB episodes can still be streamed, thanks to much of the website being preserved by the Internet Archive&#x27;s Wayback Machine.

&quot;Forbes&quot; magazine valued Spacely Sprockets at $1.3 billion, on its &quot;The 25 Largest Fictional Companies&quot; list.

The original cartoon series had several devices that did not exist at the time but subsequently have not only been invented but are in common usage: a flatscreen television, newspaper on a computer-like screen, a computer virus, video chat, a tanning bed, home treadmill and more.

In January 2009, IGN listed &quot;The Jetsons&quot; as the 46th best animated television series.

<doc id="76634" wikidata="Q2426434" url="?curid=76634" title="The Wind (1928 film)">
<text>The Wind is a 1928 American synchronized sound romantic drama film directed by Victor Sjöström. While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using both the sound-on-disc and sound-on-film process. The movie was adapted by Frances Marion from the 1925 novel of the same name written by Dorothy Scarborough. Featuring Lillian Gish, Lars Hanson and Montagu Love, it is one of the last films released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer without audible dialogue and is considered to be among the greatest &quot;silent&quot; films.

The film entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

==Plot==
An impoverished young woman named Letty Mason travels west by train from Virginia to live at her cousin Beverly&#x27;s isolated ranch in Sweetwater, Texas. On the way, she is bothered by the constantly blowing wind. Fellow passenger and cattle buyer Wirt Roddy makes her acquaintance and tells her the wind usually drives women crazy.

Upon arrival, she is picked up by Beverly&#x27;s closest neighbors, Lige Hightower and the older, balding Sourdough, who live 15 miles from her cousin. Wirt assures her he will drop by occasionally to see how she is doing.

After endless miles in sand and wind, they arrive at the ranch. Beverly is delighted to see her, but his jealous wife Cora gives her a cold reception, despite Letty saying she and Beverly (who was raised by Letty&#x27;s mother) are like brother and sister. Cora is further angered when her children seem to like Letty better.

At a party, Sourdough tells Lige that he intends proposing to Letty. Lige explains he was planning to do the same. After Wirt drops by, a cyclone interrupts the festivities. Most of the guests seek shelter in the basement, where Wirt declares his love for Letty and offers to take her away from the dismal place. After the cyclone passes, Lige and Sourdough talk to Letty in private. When they flip a coin to see who will ask for her hand in marriage (Lige wins), Letty thinks it is just a joke.

Afterward, Cora demands that Letty leaves the ranch. Because she has neither money nor a place to go, she decides to go away with Wirt, but then Wirt reveals that he wants her for a mistress, informing her that he already has a wife. She goes back to Cora, who tells her to choose from her two other suitors. She marries Lige.

When Lige takes her home, he kisses Letty for the first time, but her lack of enthusiasm is unmistakable. Worse for the drink, he becomes more forceful, and she tells him she hates him. He promises he will never touch her, and will try to make enough money to send her back to Virginia. In the meantime, Letty works around the house, but is bothered by the ever-present wind.

One day, Lige is invited to a meeting of the cattlemen, who must do something to avoid starvation. Letty, terrified of being left alone with the wind, begs to go with him, and he agrees. After she cannot control her horse in the fierce wind, he has her get on behind him on his horse. When she falls off, Lige tells Sourdough to take her home.

When the cattlemen return, they bring an unwanted guest, an injured Wirt. After he recovers, Lige insists he participate in a roundup of wild horses to raise money for the cattlemen. Wirt goes along, but later sneaks away and returns to Letty. Out of her mind with fear as she endures the house shaking from the worst wind storm yet, Letty faints soon after Wirt&#x27;s arrival. He picks her up and carries her to the bed.

The next morning, Wirt tries to persuade Letty to go away with him, but she coldly rejects him. He insists, noting Lige will kill them both if they remain. As Wirt becomes more aggressive, Letty picks up Wirt&#x27;s revolver from the table to defend herself. Confident that Letty will not fire, Wirt grabs the gun and it goes off, killing him. At first startled by Wirt&#x27;s death, Letty looks confusedly at him and at the gun in her hand; she then decides to bury him outside.

After she is done, she goes back inside the cabin. The wind blows into an even greater fury, and Letty stares with mounting fear through a window as the wind gradually uncovers Wirt&#x27;s body, terrifying her. Letty runs away from the window, but then sees two hands clasped around the cabin&#x27;s door trying to force it open; Letty hysterically believes it is Wirt returned from the dead, and falls prone with terror, her face hidden, as someone enters. The hands turn her over, and Letty stares upward blank with madness. However, it is actually Lige, who has returned. After a few moments, Letty returns to sanity and recognizes Lige; she is so glad to see him, she frantically kisses her husband. She then confesses she killed and buried Wirt. When Lige looks outside, however, the corpse is nowhere to be seen. He tells Letty that the wind can remove traces when a killing is justified. He has enough money to send her away, but Letty declares that she loves him, that she no longer wants to leave, and that she is no longer afraid of the wind or anything else.

==Cast==
* Lillian Gish as Letty
* Lars Hanson as Lige
* Montagu Love as Roddy
* Dorothy Cumming as Cora
* Edward Earle as Beverly
* William Orlamond as Sourdough
* Carmencita Johnson, Laon Ramon and Billy Kent Schaefer as Cora&#x27;s children

==Music==
In 2019, the Dallas Chamber Symphony commissioned an original film score for &quot;The Wind&quot; from composer Alain Mayrand. The score premiered during a concert screening on November 23, 2019 at Moody Performance Hall with Richard McKay conducting.

This film featured a theme song entitled &quot;Love Brought The Sunshine&quot; which was composed by William Axt, David Mendoza, Herman Ruby and Dave Dreyer.

==Production==


Gish came up with the idea of making a film adaptation of the novel of the same name. Irving Thalberg immediately gave her permission to do so. Gish recalled wanting Lars Hanson as her leading man after seeing him in a Swedish film with Greta Garbo. She also assigned Victor Sjöström as the director herself. Sjöström directed Gish before in the 1926 film &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;.

In the original novel, the heroine is driven mad when the wind uncovers the corpse of the man she has killed. She then wanders off into a windstorm to die. According to Gish and popular legend, the original ending intended for the film was the unhappy ending, but it was changed in response to the decree, by the studio&#x27;s powerful Eastern office, that a more upbeat ending be shot. It is rumored that this tampering caused Seastrom to move back to Sweden. Mayer&#x27;s biographer rejects this on account that the &quot;sad ending&quot; is not known to exist in any form, written or filmed. Regardless of whether an unhappy ending was originally intended, in the resulting film the &quot;happy&quot; ending replaced the original ending against the wishes of both Lillian Gish and Victor Sjöström.

The film was shot partially near Bakersfield and the Mojave Desert, California.

==Release==
Although it was completed by the summer of 1927, the film&#x27;s release was delayed by the studio until November 23 in 1928, a full year after the release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), when audiences wanted sound films. Gish recalled: “Mr. Thalberg said we had a very artistic film, which I knew was a veiled punch,” Like a number of films that appeared on the cusp of the new sound film era, The Wind was overlooked by critics, much as was Josef von Sternberg’s &quot;The Case of Lena Smith&quot; (1929).

===Box office===

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was nervous about releasing the film and did not release it for a full year until November 1928. It was released with a Movietone score and sound effects for theaters equipped with sound, however by that time, films with 100% dialogue/ talking sequences were being released in theaters, which contributed to &quot;The Wind&quot; recording an $87,000 loss.

===Contemporary response===
&quot;The Wind&quot; is considered to be a classic, and one of Gish&#x27;s most brilliant performances. It is the last silent film starring Gish, one of the last films directed by Sjöström in America, and the last major silent released by MGM. At its time it was simultaneously panned and hailed by American critics, and its late release at the dawn of the sound era contributed to a net loss for the production. However, the film had significant critical and considerable commercial success in Europe.

When the film first opened in 1928, many critics panned it. Mordaunt Hall, film critic for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; for example, was very critical of the film and he found it difficult to suspend his disbelief regarding the special effects and Lillian Gish&#x27;s acting. He wrote, &quot;Yesterday afternoon&#x27;s rain was far more interesting than...&quot;The Wind,&quot;...The rain was real, and in spite of the lowering skies there was life and color around you. In the picture, the wind, whether it is a breeze or a cyclone, invariably seems a sham, and Lillian Gish, the stellar light in this new film, frequently poses where the wind is strongest; during one of the early episodes she does her bit to accentuate the artificiality of this tale by wearing the worst kind of hat for a wind. Victor Seastrom hammers home his points until one longs for just a suggestion of subtlety. The villain&#x27;s sinister smile appears to last until his dying breath.&quot;

===Retrospective assessment===
&quot;The Wind&quot; has gained significant prestige retroactively.

The British newspaper, &quot;The Guardian,&quot; in 1999 reviewed the work of director Victor Sjöström and they wrote,

In a retrospective of silent films, the Museum of Modern Art screened &quot;The Wind&quot; and included a review of the film in their program. They wrote, &quot;What makes &quot;The Wind&quot; such an eloquent coda to its dying medium is Seastrom&#x27;s and Gish&#x27;s distillation of their art forms to the simplest, most elemental form: there are no frills. Seastrom was always at his best as a visual poet of natural forces impinging on human drama; in his films, natural forces convey drama and control human destiny. Gish, superficially fragile and innocent, could plumb the depths of her steely soul and find the will to prevail. The genius of both Seastrom and Gish comes to a climactic confluence in &quot;The Wind.&quot; Gish is Everywoman, subject to the most basic male brutality and yet freshly open to the possibility of romance. As a result, the film offers a quintessential cinematic moment of the rarest and most transcendentally pure art.&quot;

Biographer Lewis Jacobs compares &quot;The Wind&quot; favorably to Austrian-American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim’s 1924 masterpiece &quot;Greed&quot;:
Jacobs adds that Seastrom, in his treatment of American Midwesterners was “as uncompromising as von Stroheim in depicting it.”

==Theme==
The chief thematic element of the picture is suggested by the title, namely “human lives molded by the elements.” Jacobs writes:
Film historian Scott Eyman locates the theme in a social issue that preoccupied Hollywood in the late 1920s: “the dangers of the city, and the homicidal small-mindedness of the country.” Eyman writes:

==Legacy==
In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

<text>Within Our Gates is a 1920 American silent race drama film produced, written and directed by Oscar Micheaux. The film portrays the contemporary racial situation in the United States during the early twentieth century, the years of Jim Crow, the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, the Great Migration of blacks to cities of the North and Midwest, and the emergence of the &quot;New Negro&quot;.

The plot features an African-American woman who goes North in an effort to raise money for a rural school in the Deep South for poor Black children. Her romance with a Black doctor eventually leads to revelations about her family&#x27;s past and her own mixed-race, European ancestry. The film portrays racial violence under white supremacy, and the lynching of black people. It is the oldest known surviving film by an African-American director and has been named as one of the greatest films of all time by a Black director.

Sylvia Landry, a young African-American woman, visits her cousin Alma in the North. Sylvia is waiting for the return of Conrad as they plan to marry. Alma also loves Conrad. Larry, Alma&#x27;s step brother, attempts to woo Sylvia but is rebuffed. Larry kills a professional gambler after cheating during a game of poker. Alma arranges for Sylvia to be caught in a seemingly compromising situation by Conrad when he returns. Conrad begins to strangle Sylvia but is stopped by Alma. Conrad leaves for Brazil. Sylvia returns to the South.

Sylvia meets Rev. Jacobs, a minister who runs a rural school for black children called Piney Woods School. The school is overcrowded, and Rev. Jacobs cannot continue on the small amount offered to blacks for education by the state. With the school facing closure, Sylvia volunteers to return to the North to try to raise $5,000.

Sylvia&#x27;s purse is stolen in Boston. A man named Dr. Vivian chases after the thief and recovers the purse. After running into the street to save a child from being run over, Sylvia is hit by the car herself. As she recovers in the hospital, she meets the owner of the car - Elena Warwick, a wealthy philanthropist. Learning of Sylvia&#x27;s mission, Elena decides to give her the needed money. When her Southern friend Mrs. Stratton tries to discourage her, Warwick increases her donation to $50,000. This amount will save the school, and Sylvia returns to the South.

Rev. Jacobs asks for Sylvia&#x27;s hand in marriage, but Sylvia, now in love with Dr. Vivian, refuses. Larry, on the run from the police, runs into Sylvia and attempts blackmail with secrets of Sylvia&#x27;s past. Instead of having her secrets revealed to the school by Larry, Sylvia runs away in the night and heads north. Later on, Dr. Vivian searches for Sylvia. Larry, who has run out of money and returned to Alma, is fatally shot during an attempted bank robbery. Dr. Vivian by chance ends up treating Larry and meets Alma. Alma tells Dr. Vivian about Sylvia&#x27;s past: these flashback scenes are portrayed in the film. Sylvia was adopted and raised by a poor black family, the Landrys, who managed to provide her with an education.

During her youth, Sylvia&#x27;s father Jasper Landry was wrongfully accused of the murder of Philip Gridlestone, an unpopular but wealthy white landlord, the accusation done by Philip&#x27;s loyal black servant, Efrem. A white mob attacked the Landry family, lynching the parents and burning their bodies afterwards. Their young son Emil managed to escape after nearly being shot. The mob also lynched Efrem despite him collaborating with them. Sylvia also escaped after being chased and attacked by Armand Gridlestone, Philip&#x27;s brother, who overpowered her and was close to raping her. Noticing a scar on her breast, Armand realized that Sylvia was in fact his mixed-race daughter, born of his marriage to a local black woman and had paid for her education.

After hearing about her life, Dr. Vivian meets with Sylvia; he encourages her to love her country and take pride in the contributions of African Americans. He professes his love for her, and they marry.

==Production==
&quot;Within Our Gates&quot; was produced when early film studios in America&#x27;s first motion picture industry were based in Fort Lee, New Jersey at the beginning of the 20th century.

Often regarded in the context of D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), Micheaux&#x27;s project has been considered by critics as a response. The film&#x27;s portrayal of lynching shows &quot;what Blacks knew and Northern Whites refused to believe&quot;, turning the &quot;accusation of &#x27;primitivism&#x27;... back onto White Southern culture&quot;.
Also during this period was the Chicago Race Riot of 1919, in which white mobs killed numerous Black people, and burned residential districts, leaving thousands of Black citizens homeless. The critic Ronald J. Green believes that Micheaux had seen that Black citizens had fought back in Chicago, and chose the title with an allusion to the risk to whites in future racial violence.

&quot;Within Our Gates&quot; was the second of more than forty films directed by Micheaux. On a limited budget, Micheaux had to use borrowed costumes and props. He had no opportunity to reshoot scenes.

==Preservation==
After being presumed lost for decades, the film was found when a single print, titled &quot;La Negra&quot; (&quot;The Black Woman&quot;), was discovered in 1979 Spain by film historian Thomas Cripps. A brief sequence in the middle of the film was lost. Only four of the original English intertitles survived, the rest having been replaced with Spanish intertitles when acquired by the Filmoteca Española for Pts 4,000 in 1956.

In 1993, the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center restored the film as closely as possible to the original. Scott Simmon translated the Spanish titles back into English, removed explanatory material added for Spanish audiences, and drew from the style and diction used by Micheaux in his novels and in the intertitles for &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, his only silent film to survive with the original intertitles. The missing sequence was summarized with an intertitle frame.

==Response==
&quot;Within Our Gates&quot; initially was rejected by the Board of Censors in Chicago when Micheaux submitted the film in December 1919. An article in the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; of January 17, 1920, asserted: &quot;This is the picture that required two solid months to get by the Censor Boards.&quot; A week later the &quot;Defender&quot; reported,

Those who reasoned with the spectacle of last July in Chicago ever before them, declared the showing pre-eminently dangerous; while those who reasoned with the knowledge of existing conditions, the injustices of the times, the lynchings and handicaps of ignorance, determined that the time is ripe to bring the lesson to the front.

Critics of the film feared that scenes with lynching and attempted rape would spark interracial violence in a city still tense from the riots of July 1919. Officials in Omaha (which also suffered a racial riot), New Orleans, and other cities objected for similar reasons when they blocked the screening of the film or demanded that those scenes be cut.

When released in January 1920 against reports of the controversy, the film garnered large audiences in Chicago. It was screened in differently cut versions. For example, an article in the &quot;Defender&quot; reported that on February 24, 1920, &quot;Within Our Gates&quot; would be shown at the States Theater in Chicago &quot;without the cuts which were made before its initial presentation.&quot; Other evidence of cuts were extant film stills of scenes that did not appear in the surviving film copy, and viewers&#x27; descriptions that differed from the current version of the film.

It is considered an important expression of African-American life in the years immediately following World War I, when violent racist incidents occurred throughout the United States, but most frequently in the South. In 1992, &quot;Within Our Gates&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant&quot;.

DJ Spooky created a new score for the film as part of a box set with Kino Lorber.

In 2023, &quot;Within Our Gates&quot; was named by Slate as one of the greatest films ever created by Black directors. The film was also the earlier film listed by Slate as being part of the &quot;new Black film canon.&quot;

==Aesthetics==
Micheaux&#x27;s work has often been criticized as lacking aesthetic finesse or artistic power. Micheaux constructed &quot;Within Our Gates&quot; to educate his audience about racism, uplift, peonage, women&#x27;s rights, and the urban &quot;new Negro&quot; emerging after the Great Migration.

His movement in the plot between North and South was similar to that of D. W. Griffith, who used a north–south marriage plot, but also expressed the mobility of peoples during this period. Griffith dramatized a white reunion of regions that canceled the legacy of the Reconstruction Era to leave blacks out of the national picture. Micheaux&#x27;s film ended with a wedding that united sophisticated African Americans from the North and South. Together, they symbolically lay claim to the whole nation, despite discrimination against blacks in the military, and the racial riots of 1919, which were based in labor and social competition.

Critics (such as Jane Gaines, Ronald Green, and Pearl Bowser and Louise Spence) note how Micheaux intercut the lynching of the Landry family with the attempted rape of Sylvia by Gridlestone. This editing deconstructed the white ideology that lynching was to punish black men for alleged sexual assaults against white women. Micheaux portrayed the more frequent sexual assaults of black women by white men, alluding to the widespread historical practice of white men taking advantage of black women slaves. Other passages were edited to deconstruct white visual traditions and white ideologies. The film also touched on several current social and political events, including the death of Theodore Roosevelt, the contributions of African-American soldiers to the war, and debates in the US Senate over Jim Crow laws and labor peonage in the South.

==Representation of racism==
The film portrayed several aspects of contemporary African-American society. Heroes and heroines included Sylvia Landry and Reverend Jacobs, criminals such as Larry, and &quot;lackeys&quot; such as a minister whom Mrs. Stafford supported, who encouraged African Americans to reject suffrage. The critic Ronald J. Green suggests that Bernice Ladd as Mrs. Statton represents a &quot;Lillian Gish figure&quot;, referring to her role in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;. Statton is portrayed as racist and anti-feminist. Green notes that Micheaux intended the links between the films, and cast Ladd in part for her physical resemblance to Gish. Early in &quot;Within Our Gates&quot; Micheaux uses the character Mrs. Geraldine Stratton, a rich southern white woman, to depict the reality of American life not a world where there are no white people. Mrs. Stratton embodies the essence of southern prejudice; as a result of her fear of black women receiving the right to vote, she opposes women suffrage. With the use of the cinematic techniques, the viewer looks over the shoulder of Mrs. Stratton as she reads a newspaper article entitled &quot;Law Proposed to Stop Negroes&quot;. This article explains that the Mississippi senator James K. Vardaman has proposed a bill to negate the Fifteenth Amendment. Vardaman justifies his action by stating: &quot;from the soles of their flat feet to the crown of their head, negroes are undoubtedly inferior beings, therefore, how can we in conscience permit them to vote?&quot;

Efrem, a servant to Gridlestone, denounced Mr. Landry as the murderer, although he was not a witness to the crime. Overturning the relationship which Efrem believed he had with whites, a mob lynched him when it failed to find the Landrys.

The character of Old Ned justifies the present racial system as God&#x27;s ordained plan; being poor and uneducated are attributes that will lead African Americans into heaven. He preaches to his congregation that &quot;white folks, with all their schooling, all their wealth, will most all fall into the everlasting inferno, while our race, lacking these vices and whose souls are more pure, most all will ascend to heaven.&quot; In one of the most heartbreaking and provoking scenes of the film, Old Ned after humiliating himself in a room full of whites, closes the door and turns from a smiling buffoon to a repulsed black man. It has all been a performance. Old Ned says to the camera, &quot;Again I&#x27;ve sold my birthright. All for a miserable &#x27;mess of pottage.&#x27;&quot; Hopeless and unfulfilled, he states: &quot;Negroes and whites - all are equal. As for me, miserable sinner, Hell is my destiny.&quot; Uncle Tom characters are a staple in mainstream media. As Old Ned reprimands himself, Micheaux implies that these characters are less than a man.

<text>Minerva &quot;Minnie&quot; Mouse is an American cartoon character created by the Walt Disney Company. As the longtime sweetheart of Mickey Mouse, she is an anthropomorphic mouse with white gloves, a red or pink bow, blue (or pink or red) polka-dotted dress, white bloomers and yellow low-heeled shoes occasionally with ribbons on them. 

The comic strip story &quot;Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers&quot; (published September 22 – December 26, 1930) introduced her father Marcus Mouse and her unnamed mother, both farmers. The same story featured photographs of Minnie&#x27;s uncle Milton Mouse with his family and her grandparents Marvel Mouse and Matilda Mouse. Her best-known relatives, however, remain her uncle Mortimer Mouse (Mortimer was almost the name of Mickey) and her twin nieces, Millie and Melody Mouse, though most often a single niece, Melody, appears. In many appearances, Minnie is presented as the girlfriend of Mickey Mouse, best friend of Daisy Duck and a friend to Clarabelle Cow.

In honor of her 90th anniversary, on January 22, 2018, she joined the ranks of other animated celebrities by receiving her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was the sixth Disney character to receive this honor. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Winnie the Pooh, Tinker Bell and Snow White have already received this distinction.

As of January 1, 2024, Minnie Mouse as depicted in her first shorts entered the public domain.

==History==
===Origins of the character===

Minnie was initially created to be the love interest of Mickey Mouse, concept art for Mickey showed a female mouse alongside him.

Minnie was designed in the fashion of a flapper girl. Her main outfit consisted of a short flapper girl dress that often revealed her distinctive patched knickers. In the 1929 cartoon &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot;, it was also revealed that she wears black stockings which were also fashionable among flapper girls. Her shoes are probably her most distinctive article of clothing. For comedic effect, she wears oversized high heeled pumps that are too big for her feet. Her heels often slip out of her shoes and she even loses her shoes completely in &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;. When she walked or danced, the clip clop of her large pumps was usually heard clearly and often went with the rhythm of the music that was played in the background. Along with Mickey, she was redesigned in 1940. Her hat was replaced with a large bow and bows were added to her shoes as well. Her eyes were also given more detail. Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, her look and personality became more conservative. Minnie almost always wears red or pink, but in her early appearances, she could be seen wearing a combination of blue, black or green (when not depicted in black and white).

Minnie&#x27;s early personality is cute, playful, musical and flirtatious. She often portrays an entertainer like a dancer or a musician whose affection Mickey is trying to win. Part of the comedy of these early shorts is the varying degree of success Mickey has in wooing Minnie. Unlike later cartoons after the redesign, Minnie often becomes a damsel in distress whom Mickey tries to rescue. She is also subject to a lot of slapstick and rubber hose animation gags. Over the course of the 1930s, Minnie&#x27;s and Mickey&#x27;s relationship solidified and they eventually became a steady couple.

Minnie was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;. Minnie is invited to join Mickey in the first flight of his aircraft. She accepts the invitation but not his request for a kiss in mid-flight. Mickey eventually forces Minnie into a kiss, but this only results in her parachuting out of the plane. This first film depicted Minnie as somewhat resistant to the demanding affection of her potential boyfriend and capable of escaping his grasp.

Their debut, however, featured the couple already familiar to each other. The next film featuring them was &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;. The film was the second of their series to be produced, but the third to be released and was released on December 30, 1928. We find Minnie employed at the &quot;Cantina Argentina&quot;, a bar and restaurant established in the Pampas of Argentina. She performs the Tango for Mickey the gaucho and Black Pete the outlaw. Both flirt with her, but the latter intends to abduct her while the former obliges in saving the Damsel in Distress from the villain. All three characters acted as strangers first being introduced to each other.
But it was their third cartoon that established the definitive early look and personality of both Mickey and Minnie, as well as Pete. &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot; was the third short of the series to be produced, but was released first, on November 18, 1928. Pete was featured as the Captain of the steamboat, Mickey as a crew of one and Minnie as their single passenger. The two anthropomorphic mice first star in a sound film and spend most of its duration playing music to the tune of &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;.

===Minnie&#x27;s Yoo-Hoo===
Her next appearance was arguably more significant. &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Follies&quot; (August 28, 1929), featured the first performance of the song &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Yoo-Hoo&quot;. &quot;The guy they call little Mickey Mouse&quot; for the first time addresses an audience to explain that he has &quot;got a sweetie&quot; who is &quot;neither fat nor skinny&quot; and proudly proclaims that &quot;she&#x27;s my little Minnie Mouse&quot;. Mickey then proceeds to explain his reaction to Minnie&#x27;s call. The song firmly establishes Mickey and Minnie as a couple and expresses the importance Minnie holds for her male partner.

===Damsel in distress===
Her final appearance for the year was in &quot;Wild Waves&quot;, carried by a wave into the sea. She panics terribly and seems to start drowning. Mickey uses a rowboat to rescue her and return her to the shore, but Minnie is still visibly shaken from the experience. Mickey starts singing the tune of &quot;Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep&quot;, a maritime ballad, in an apparent effort to cheer her up. Minnie cheers up and the short ends. This is the second time Minnie is placed in danger and then saved by her new boyfriend. It wouldn&#x27;t be the last.

In fact, this was the case with her next appearance in &quot;The Cactus Kid&quot; (May 10, 1930). As the title implies, the short was intended as a Western movie parody, but it is considered to be more or less a remake of &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot; set in Mexico instead of Argentina. Minnie was again cast as the local tavern dancer who is abducted by Peg-Leg Pedro (Black Pete in his first appearance with a peg-leg). Mickey again comes to the rescue. The short is considered significant for being the last short featuring Mickey and Minnie to be animated by Ub Iwerks.

&quot;The Shindig&quot; (July 11, 1930) featured Minnie joining Mickey, Horace and Clarabelle in a barn dance. Among them, Clarabelle seems to be the actual star of the short. Director Burt Gillett turned in another enjoyable entry in the series, proving that production could go on without Iwerks. This was arguably the first time Minnie was upstaged by a female co-star.

In &quot;The Fire Fighters&quot; (June 20, 1930), Minnie is trapped in a hotel during a fire. She spends the duration of the short in mortal peril but is rescued by firefighters under Chief Mickey Mouse. Horace Horsecollar is among the firefighters. An unnamed cow in the background is possibly Clarabelle making a cameo. The music of the short was, appropriately, the tune of &quot;There&#x27;ll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight&quot;.

The next entry in the series is considered curious: &quot;The Gorilla Mystery&quot; (October 1, 1930). The short starts with Beppo the Gorilla escaping from a zoo. Mickey learns of it and terribly panics. He phones Minnie to warn her about the dangerous gorilla wandering about. Minnie is unconcerned and plays tunes on her piano for Mickey to hear over the phone and know she isn&#x27;t afraid. Her tunes are interrupted by her scream and Mickey rushes to her house to save her. Meanwhile, Beppo has wrapped up Minnie in rope and holds her hostage. Mickey confronts the gorilla and once again rescues the damsel in distress.

===Introduction of a pet===

In &quot;The Picnic&quot; (1930), Minnie introduces her boyfriend to her new pet dog, Rover. This is actually Pluto making his first appearance as an individual character. Two unnamed bloodhound guard dogs strikingly similar to him had previously appeared in &quot;The Chain Gang&quot; (August 18, 1930) which featured Mickey incarcerated in prison without Minnie at his side. Otherwise, the short features a typical picnic excursion harassed by forest animals and brought to a premature end by a sudden rain.

The final appearance of Minnie during the year was &quot;Pioneer Days&quot; (November 20, 1930). The short featured Minnie and her mate as pioneer settlers heading to the American Old West driving a covered wagon in a wagon train. They are unsurprisingly attacked by Native Americans on their way, this was a stock plot of Western movies at the time. While their fellows are either subjected to scalping or running for their lives, Minnie is captured by the attackers. Mickey attempts to rescue her, only to be captured himself. In a reversal of their usual roles, Minnie escapes her captors and rescues her mate. They then dress as soldiers of the United States Army. Their mere appearance proves sufficient to have the entire tribe running for the hills. The Mouse couple stands triumphant at the end. The short has been criticized for its unflattering depiction of Native Americans as rather bestial predators. The finale has been edited out in recent viewings for depicting the &quot;braves&quot; submitting to cowardice.

In several shorts, comics and TV shows, Minnie owns a black and white kitten named Figaro, who had originated in the Disney animated feature &quot;Pinocchio&quot;.

===Waning years===
During the second half of the 1930s, Minnie didn&#x27;t appear as often in Mickey cartoons. This was mainly due to the growth in popularity of Mickey&#x27;s new sidekicks, Goofy, Donald Duck and Pluto, whose appearances in Mickey cartoons had more or less replaced Minnie&#x27;s role. Minnie&#x27;s appearances in Mickey cartoons thus became less numerous, but she did have a few major roles in some Pluto and Figaro cartoons during the 1940s. Minnie made a sort of comeback in the 1980s when she was re-introduced in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; and then got her own starring role in &quot;Totally Minnie&quot;.

===Contemporary appearances===
*She starred in a 1988 musical television special on NBC called &quot;Totally Minnie,&quot; it was the first film to feature Minnie in a lead role. She also appeared in a line of merchandise called Minnie &#x27;n Me in the 1990s. On September 18, 1990, the CD &quot;Minnie &#x27;n Me: Songs Just For Girls&quot; was released.
*Minnie&#x27;s return to animation came in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (December 16, 1983). She was cast as Mrs. Cratchit. As with most Disney characters, she was given a small cameo in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) but doesn&#x27;t have any lines in the latter movie, despite her voice actress being listed in the end credits.
*Minnie Mouse makes an appearance in every episode of &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot;.
*Minnie ran a neighborhood in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Toontown Online&quot; called Minnie&#x27;s Melodyland. It was an intermediate area with access to Toontown Central, The Brrrgh and Donald&#x27;s Dreamland.
*Minnie is available to sign autographs and take pictures throughout the day in various locations at the different Disney Resort Theme Parks around the world. She also appears in all of the daily parades that take place at the Disney resorts. 
*In the 2013 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; television series, Minnie was restored to her classic 1930s look with the flowered bowler hat and flapper girl outfit. Minnie also gained more character quirks, and like the older cartoons, was subject to more slapstick and rubber hose cartoon gags.
*On June 22, 2017, it was announced that Minnie, alongside &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, Zoe Saldana and Lin-Manuel Miranda, would be receiving her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018.
*In December 2019, both Minnie and Mickey served as special co-hosts of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; for two weeks during Disney&#x27;s Secret Santa Giveaway while Vanna White served as the main host during Pat Sajak&#x27;s absence.

On January 1, 2024, the copyrights of the first three animated Mickey Mouse cartoons and their portrayal of Mickey and Minnie Mouse expired, and they entered the public domain. They are the silent versions of the cartoons &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; and &quot;The Gallopin&#x27; Gaucho&quot;, and the sound cartoon &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. Newer versions of Minnie Mouse remained copyright protected. On January 1, 2025, the sound versions mentioned above, and another twelve cartoons and their depictions of Minnie become public domain.

==Television==
In &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot;, she appeared in her own segments. Occasionally, she starred in &quot;Maestro Minnie&quot; shorts, in which she conducts an orchestra of living instruments that she usually has to tame.

In &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, Minnie is in charge of running the nightclub, while Mickey primarily serves as the host. In one episode of House of Mouse, &quot;Clarabelle&#x27;s Big Secret&quot;, Minnie reveals that she has gone to the movies with Mortimer Mouse, although it isn&#x27;t a date.

She appears in two children&#x27;s shows on Disney Jr.: the full-length educational &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; and the spin-off series of shorts &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Bow-Toons&quot;, where she runs a &quot;bow-tique&quot; selling bows like the ones she and Daisy wear. In season 2 of &quot;Bow-Toons&quot;, she displays high physical strength and balance at least twice, able to balance her entire bodyweight in a 1-finger handstand.

In the 2013 &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; television series and its 2020 spinoff &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot;, she exhibits the ability to survive her head coming off, doing a 360 degree flip and re-attaching itself, which can happen when she feels surprised.

In 2017, as part of the launch of &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;, Minnie&#x27;s Happy Helpers adventures appear in the second half of every new episode.

==Minnie as a queen and princess==
Minnie has had several appearances as a princess throughout the ages, including the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; short films &quot;Ye Olden Days&quot; (1933) and &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot; (1938).

===&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series===
Minnie appears in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game series as the queen of Disney Castle, with Mickey serving as the king and her husband. She, at the suggestion of a letter left by the missing King, sends Donald Duck and Goofy on their mission to find Mickey and the Keyblade Master, Sora. During &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, when Pete&#x27;s tampering of the past causes the Heartless to appear in Disney Castle, Minnie is forced to fall back to the library up until Sora and company arrive. While Donald and Goofy head out to get the other residents to safety, Sora serves as the Queen&#x27;s bodyguard to get her to the Cornerstone of Light. During this time, Minnie shows powers as a sorceress of white magic, casting a holy light on the Heartless that attack. In the prequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;, she oversees the annually held Dream Festival in Disney Town, where Pete causes mischief up until she banishes him to another dimension as a punishment. She appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot; in a role mirroring that in the film &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;, where she is referred to as Princess Minnie and rules a world called the Country of the Musketeers. By this, it is inferred that she, not Mickey, is the rightful ruler of Disney Castle, which is why he leaves her in charge. She makes a brief appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, welcoming Mickey, Donald and Goofy back to Disney Castle.

===&quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;===
In the 2004 direct-to-video film &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot;, Minnie plays the role of the princess of France, who continually daydreams about her true love, Mickey. She is also the only monarch getting in the way of the plans of Pete, who can&#x27;t take over the kingdom if he can&#x27;t get rid of her. For this particular film, Minnie is drawn with hair bangs, which do not appear in any later cartoons.

===&quot;Wizards of Mickey&quot;===
In the fantasy comic series &quot;Wizards of Mickey&quot;, Minnie is the sorceress princess of the kingdom of Dolmen whose people have been turned to stone, leading her to seek a magical Crystal to restore them. In her quest, she partners with her friends Daisy and Clarabelle as team Diamond Moon and eventually meets up with Mickey, the Supreme Sorcerer of Dolmen, and his group.

==Voice actors==

Minnie Mouse was first voiced by Walt Disney, who was also the original voice of Mickey Mouse.

Marjorie Ralston, a Disney inker who joined the animation team as Disney&#x27;s thirteenth employee, voiced her in the 1929 short &quot;Wild Waves&quot;, but didn&#x27;t further pursue the role out of shyness. Then, from 1930 up until 1941, Minnie was voiced by Marcellite Garner. Then, from 1941 to 1942 and on the radio program, &quot;The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air&quot;, she was voiced by Thelma Boardman. Boardman also voiced her in the short &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Birthday Party&quot; in 1942. Shirley Reed voiced Minnie in &quot;Two-Gun Mickey&quot; expect the end. Following this, from 1944 to 1952, Ruth Clifford provided the character&#x27;s voice. Janet Waldo voiced Minnie in the 1974 Disneyland record album, &quot;An Adaptation of Dickens&#x27; Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players&quot;.

Minnie would go without any spoken dialogue up until 1986, when Russi Taylor inherited the role, which she performed up until her death in 2019 (her husband, Wayne Allwine, voiced Mickey from 1977 up until his death in 2009), Taylor&#x27;s voice is used in various TV series and theme parks via archival and posthumous dialogue. Kaitlyn Robrock officially took over as the new voice of Minnie, beginning with two Disney Jr. stop-motion Mickey Mouse shorts, &quot;Mickey Mouse and the Magical Snowy Holiday&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mouse and the Magical Holiday Bag&quot;, both released in November 2019.

Robrock continues voicing Minnie in &quot;The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse&quot; on Disney+ and onward.

<doc id="76640" wikidata="Q179126" url="?curid=76640" title="John Ruskin">
<text>John Ruskin (8 February 1819 20 January 1900) was an English polymath a writer, lecturer, art historian, art critic, draughtsman and philanthropist of the Victorian era. He wrote on subjects as varied as art, architecture, political economy, education, museology, geology, botany, ornithology, literature, history, and myth.

Ruskin&#x27;s writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. He wrote essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. He also made detailed sketches and paintings of rocks, plants, birds, landscapes, architectural structures and ornamentation. The elaborate style that characterised his earliest writing on art gave way in time to plainer language designed to communicate his ideas more effectively. In all of his writing, he emphasised the connections between nature, art and society.

Ruskin was hugely influential in the latter half of the 19th century and up to the First World War. After a period of relative decline, his reputation has steadily improved since the 1960s with the publication of numerous academic studies of his work. Today, his ideas and concerns are widely recognised as having anticipated interest in environmentalism, sustainability, ethical consumerism, and craft.

Ruskin first came to widespread attention with the first volume of &quot;Modern Painters&quot; (1843), an extended essay in defence of the work of J. M. W. Turner in which he argued that the principal duty of the artist is &quot;truth to nature&quot;. This meant rooting art in experience and close observation. From the 1850s, he championed the Pre-Raphaelites, who were influenced by his ideas. His work increasingly focused on social and political issues. &quot;Unto This Last&quot; (1860, 1862) marked the shift in emphasis. In 1869, Ruskin became the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at the University of Oxford, where he established the Ruskin School of Drawing. In 1871, he began his monthly &quot;letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain&quot;, published under the title &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot; (1871–1884). In the course of this complex and deeply personal work, he developed the principles underlying his ideal society. Its practical outcome was the founding of the Guild of St George, an organisation that endures today.

==Early life (1819–1846)==

===Genealogy===
Ruskin was the only child of first cousins. His father, John James Ruskin (1785–1864), was a sherry and wine importer, founding partner and &quot;de facto&quot; business manager of Ruskin, Telford and Domecq (see Allied Domecq). John James was born and brought up in Edinburgh, Scotland, to a mother from Glenluce and a father originally from Hertfordshire. His wife, Margaret Cock (1781–1871), was the daughter of a publican in Croydon. She had joined the Ruskin household when she became companion to John James&#x27;s mother, Catherine.

John James had hoped to practise law, and was articled as a clerk in London. His father, John Thomas Ruskin, described as a grocer (but apparently an ambitious wholesale merchant), was an incompetent businessman. To save the family from bankruptcy, John James, whose prudence and success were in stark contrast to his father, took on all debts, settling the last of them in 1832. John James and Margaret were engaged in 1809, but opposition to the union from John Thomas, and the problem of his debts, delayed the couple&#x27;s wedding. They finally married, without celebration, in 1818. John James died on 3 March 1864 and is buried in the churchyard of St John the Evangelist, Shirley, Croydon.
===Childhood and education===

Ruskin was born on 8 February 1819 at 54 Hunter Street, Brunswick Square, London (demolished 1969), south of what is now St Pancras railway station. His childhood was shaped by the contrasting influences of his father and mother, both of whom were fiercely ambitious for him. John James Ruskin helped to develop his son&#x27;s Romanticism. They shared a passion for the works of Byron, Shakespeare and especially Walter Scott. They visited Scott&#x27;s home, Abbotsford, in 1838, but Ruskin was disappointed by its appearance. Margaret Ruskin, an evangelical Christian, more cautious and restrained than her husband, taught young John to read the Bible from beginning to end, and then to start all over again, committing large portions to memory. Its language, imagery and parables had a profound and lasting effect on his writing. He later wrote:

Ruskin&#x27;s childhood was spent from 1823 at 28 Herne Hill (demolished ), near the village of Camberwell in South London. He had few friends of his own age, but it was not the friendless and joyless experience he later said it was in his autobiography, &quot;Praeterita&quot; (1885–89). He was educated at home by his parents and private tutors, including Congregationalist preacher Edward Andrews, whose daughters, Mrs Eliza Orme and Emily Augusta Patmore were later credited with introducing Ruskin to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. 

From 1834 to 1835 he attended the school in Peckham run by the progressive evangelical Thomas Dale (1797–1870). Ruskin heard Dale lecture in 1836 at King&#x27;s College, London, where Dale was the first Professor of English Literature. Ruskin went on to enrol and complete his studies at King&#x27;s College, where he prepared for Oxford under Dale&#x27;s tutelage.

===Travel===

Ruskin was greatly influenced by the extensive and privileged travels he enjoyed in his childhood. It helped to establish his taste and augmented his education. He sometimes accompanied his father on visits to business clients at their country houses, which exposed him to English landscapes, architecture and paintings. Family tours took them to the Lake District (his first long poem, &quot;Iteriad&quot;, was an account of his tour in 1830) and to relatives in Perth, Scotland. As early as 1825, the family visited France and Belgium. Their continental tours became increasingly ambitious in scope: in 1833 they visited Strasbourg, Schaffhausen, Milan, Genoa and Turin, places to which Ruskin frequently returned. He developed a lifelong love of the Alps, and in 1835 visited Venice for the first time, that &#x27;Paradise of cities&#x27; that provided the subject and symbolism of much of his later work.

These tours gave Ruskin the opportunity to observe and record his impressions of nature. He composed elegant, though mainly conventional poetry, some of which was published in &quot;Friendship&#x27;s Offering&quot;. His early notebooks and sketchbooks are full of visually sophisticated and technically accomplished drawings of maps, landscapes and buildings, remarkable for a boy of his age. He was profoundly affected by Samuel Rogers&#x27;s poem &quot;Italy&quot; (1830), a copy of which was given to him as a 13th birthday present; in particular, he deeply admired the accompanying illustrations by J. M. W. Turner. Much of Ruskin&#x27;s own art in the 1830s was in imitation of Turner, and of Samuel Prout, whose &quot;Sketches Made in Flanders and Germany&quot; (1833) he also admired. His artistic skills were refined under the tutelage of Charles Runciman, Copley Fielding and J. D. Harding.

===First publications===
Ruskin&#x27;s journeys also provided inspiration for writing. His first publication was the poem &quot;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Lines written at the Lakes in Cumberland: Derwentwater&quot; and published in the &quot;Spiritual Times&quot;) (August 1829). In 1834, three short articles for Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Magazine of Natural History&quot; were published. They show early signs of his skill as a close &quot;scientific&quot; observer of nature, especially its geology.

From September 1837 to December 1838, Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;The Poetry of Architecture&quot; was serialised in Loudon&#x27;s &quot;Architectural Magazine&quot;, under the pen name &quot;Kata Phusin&quot; (Greek for &quot;According to Nature&quot;). It was a study of cottages, villas, and other dwellings centred on a Wordsworthian argument that buildings should be sympathetic to their immediate environment and use local materials. It anticipated key themes in his later writings. In 1839, Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Remarks on the Present State of Meteorological Science&quot; was published in &quot;Transactions of the Meteorological Society&quot;.

===Oxford===
In Michaelmas 1836, Ruskin matriculated at the University of Oxford, taking up residence at Christ Church in January of the following year. Enrolled as a gentleman-commoner, he enjoyed equal status with his aristocratic peers. Ruskin was generally uninspired by Oxford and suffered bouts of illness. Perhaps the greatest advantage of his time there was in the few, close friendships he made. His tutor, the Rev Walter Lucas Brown, always encouraged him, as did a young senior tutor, Henry Liddell (later the father of Alice Liddell) and a private tutor, the Reverend Osborne Gordon. He became close to the geologist and natural theologian William Buckland. Among his fellow undergraduates, Ruskin&#x27;s most important friends were Charles Thomas Newton and Henry Acland.

His most noteworthy success came in 1839 when, at the third attempt, he won the prestigious Newdigate Prize for poetry (Arthur Hugh Clough came second). He met William Wordsworth, who was receiving an honorary degree, at the ceremony.

Ruskin&#x27;s health was poor and he never became independent from his family during his time at Oxford. His mother took lodgings on High Street, where his father joined them at weekends. He was devastated to hear that his first love, Adèle Domecq, the second daughter of his father&#x27;s business partner, had become engaged to a French nobleman. In April 1840, whilst revising for his examinations, he began to cough blood, which led to fears of consumption and a long break from Oxford travelling with his parents.

Before he returned to Oxford, Ruskin responded to a challenge that had been put to him by Effie Gray, whom he later married: the twelve-year-old Effie had asked him to write a fairy story. During a six-week break at Leamington Spa to undergo Dr Jephson&#x27;s (1798–1878) celebrated salt-water cure, Ruskin wrote his only work of fiction, the fable &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot; (not published until December 1850 (but imprinted 1851), with illustrations by Richard Doyle). A work of Christian sacrificial morality and charity, it is set in the Alpine landscape Ruskin loved and knew so well. It remains the most translated of all his works. Back at Oxford, in 1842 Ruskin sat for a pass degree, and was awarded an uncommon honorary double fourth-class degree in recognition of his achievements.

===&quot;Modern Painters I&quot; (1843)===

For much of the period from late 1840 to autumn 1842, Ruskin was abroad with his parents, mainly in Italy. His studies of Italian art were chiefly guided by George Richmond, to whom the Ruskins were introduced by Joseph Severn, a friend of Keats (whose son, Arthur Severn, later married Ruskin&#x27;s cousin, Joan). He was galvanised into writing a defence of J. M. W. Turner when he read an attack on several of Turner&#x27;s pictures exhibited at the Royal Academy. It recalled an attack by the critic Rev John Eagles in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1836, which had prompted Ruskin to write a long essay. John James had sent the piece to Turner, who did not wish it to be published. It finally appeared in 1903.

Before Ruskin began &quot;Modern Painters&quot;, John James Ruskin had begun collecting watercolours, including works by Samuel Prout and Turner. Both painters were among occasional guests of the Ruskins at Herne Hill, and 163 Denmark Hill (demolished 1947) to which the family moved in 1842.

What became the first volume of &quot;Modern Painters&quot; (1843), published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co. under the anonymous authority of &quot;A Graduate of Oxford&quot;, was Ruskin&#x27;s answer to Turner&#x27;s critics. Ruskin controversially argued that modern landscape painters—and in particular Turner—were superior to the so-called &quot;Old Masters&quot; of the post-Renaissance period. Ruskin maintained that, unlike Turner, Old Masters such as Gaspard Dughet (Gaspar Poussin), Claude, and Salvator Rosa favoured pictorial convention, and not &quot;truth to nature&quot;. He explained that he meant &quot;moral as well as material truth&quot;. The job of the artist is to observe the reality of nature and not to invent it in a studioto render imaginatively on canvas what he has seen and understood, free of any rules of composition. For Ruskin, modern landscapists demonstrated superior understanding of the &quot;truths&quot; of water, air, clouds, stones, and vegetation, a profound appreciation of which Ruskin demonstrated in his own prose. He described works he had seen at the National Gallery and Dulwich Picture Gallery with extraordinary verbal felicity.

Although critics were slow to react and the reviews were mixed, many notable literary and artistic figures were impressed with the young man&#x27;s work, including Charlotte Brontë and Elizabeth Gaskell. Suddenly Ruskin had found his métier, and in one leap helped redefine the genre of art criticism, mixing a discourse of polemic with aesthetics, scientific observation and ethics. It cemented Ruskin&#x27;s relationship with Turner. After the artist died in 1851, Ruskin catalogued nearly 20,000 sketches that Turner gave to the British nation.

===1845 tour and &quot;Modern Painters II&quot; (1846)===
Ruskin toured the continent with his parents again during 1844, visiting Chamonix and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of Titian, Veronese and Perugino among others at the Louvre. In 1845, at the age of 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In Lucca he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by Jacopo della Quercia, which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the then object of his love, Rose La Touche). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the Campo Santo in Pisa, and in Florence. In Venice, he was particularly impressed by the works of Fra Angelico and Giotto in St Mark&#x27;s Cathedral, and Tintoretto in the Scuola di San Rocco, but he was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on the city: &quot;Venice is lost to me&quot;, he wrote. It finally convinced him that architectural restoration was destruction, and that the only true and faithful action was preservation and conservation.

Drawing on his travels, he wrote the second volume of &quot;Modern Painters&quot; (published April 1846). The volume concentrated on Renaissance and pre-Renaissance artists rather than on Turner. It was a more theoretical work than its predecessor. Ruskin explicitly linked the aesthetic and the divine, arguing that truth, beauty and religion are inextricably bound together: &quot;the Beautiful as a gift of God&quot;. In defining categories of beauty and imagination, Ruskin argued that all great artists must perceive beauty and, with their imagination, communicate it creatively by means of symbolic representation. Generally, critics gave this second volume a warmer reception, although many found the attack on the aesthetic orthodoxy associated with Joshua Reynolds difficult to accept. In the summer, Ruskin was abroad again with his father, who still hoped his son might become a poet, even poet laureate, just one among many factors increasing the tension between them.

==Middle life (1847–1869)==
===Marriage to Effie Gray===
During 1847, Ruskin became closer to Euphemia &quot;Effie&quot; Gray, the daughter of family friends. It was for her that Ruskin had written &quot;The King of the Golden River&quot;. The couple were engaged in October. They married on 10 April 1848 at her home, Bowerswell, in Perth, once the residence of the Ruskin family. It was the site of the suicide of John Thomas Ruskin (Ruskin&#x27;s grandfather). Owing to this association and other complications, Ruskin&#x27;s parents did not attend. The European Revolutions of 1848 meant that the newlyweds&#x27; earliest travels together were restricted, but they were able to visit Normandy, where Ruskin admired the Gothic architecture.

Their early life together was spent at 31 Park Street, Mayfair, secured for them by Ruskin&#x27;s father (later addresses included nearby 6 Charles Street, and 30 Herne Hill). Effie was too unwell to undertake the European tour of 1849, so Ruskin visited the Alps with his parents, gathering material for the third and fourth volumes of &quot;Modern Painters&quot;. He was struck by the contrast between the Alpine beauty and the poverty of Alpine peasants, stirring his increasingly sensitive social conscience.

The marriage was unhappy, with Ruskin reportedly being cruel to Effie and distrustful of her. The marriage was never consummated and was annulled six years later in 1854.

===Architecture===
Ruskin&#x27;s developing interest in architecture, and particularly in the Gothic, led to the first work to bear his name, &quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot; (1849). It contained 14 plates etched by the author. The title refers to seven moral categories that Ruskin considered vital to and inseparable from all architecture: sacrifice, truth, power, beauty, life, memory and obedience. All would provide recurring themes in his future work. &quot;Seven Lamps&quot; promoted the virtues of a secular and Protestant form of Gothic. It was a challenge to the Catholic influence of architect A. W. N. Pugin.

===&quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;===
In November 1849, John and Effie Ruskin visited Venice, staying at the Hotel Danieli. Their different personalities are revealed by their contrasting priorities. For Effie, Venice provided an opportunity to socialise, while Ruskin was engaged in solitary studies. In particular, he made a point of drawing the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro and the Doge&#x27;s Palace, or Palazzo Ducale, because he feared that they would be destroyed by the occupying Austrian troops. One of these troops, Lieutenant Charles Paulizza, became friendly with Effie, apparently with Ruskin&#x27;s consent. Her brother, among others, later claimed that Ruskin was deliberately encouraging the friendship to compromise her, as an excuse to separate.

Meanwhile, Ruskin was making the extensive sketches and notes that he used for his three-volume work &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot; (1851–53). Developing from a technical history of Venetian architecture from the Byzantine to the Renaissance, into a broad cultural history, &quot;Stones&quot; represented Ruskin&#x27;s opinion of contemporary England. It served as a warning about the moral and spiritual health of society. Ruskin argued that Venice had degenerated slowly. Its cultural achievements had been compromised, and its society corrupted, by the decline of true Christian faith. Instead of revering the divine, Renaissance artists honoured themselves, arrogantly celebrating human sensuousness.

The chapter, &quot;The Nature of Gothic&quot; appeared in the second volume of &quot;Stones&quot;. Praising Gothic ornament, Ruskin argued that it was an expression of the artisan&#x27;s joy in free, creative work. The worker must be allowed to think and to express his own personality and ideas, ideally using his own hands, rather than machinery.

This was both an aesthetic attack on, and a social critique of, the division of labour in particular, and industrial capitalism in general. This chapter had a profound effect, and was reprinted both by the Christian socialist founders of the Working Men&#x27;s College and later by the Arts and Crafts pioneer and socialist William Morris.

===Pre-Raphaelites===
John Everett Millais, William Holman Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rossetti had established the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848. The Pre-Raphaelite commitment to &#x27;naturalism&#x27; – &quot;paint[ing] from nature only&quot;, depicting nature in fine detail, had been influenced by Ruskin.

Ruskin became acquainted with Millais after the artists made an approach to Ruskin through their mutual friend Coventry Patmore. Initially, Ruskin had not been impressed by Millais&#x27;s &quot;Christ in the House of His Parents&quot; (1849–50), a painting that was considered blasphemous at the time, but Ruskin wrote letters defending the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to &quot;The Times&quot; during May 1851. Providing Millais with artistic patronage and encouragement, in the summer of 1853 the artist (and his brother) travelled to Scotland with Ruskin and Effie where, at Glen Finglas, he painted the closely observed landscape background of gneiss rock to which, as had always been intended, he later added Ruskin&#x27;s portrait.

Millais had painted a picture of Effie for &quot;The Order of Release, 1746&quot;, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1852. Suffering increasingly from physical illness and acute mental anxiety, Effie was arguing fiercely with her husband and his intense and overly protective parents, and sought solace with her own parents in Scotland. The Ruskin marriage was already undermined as she and Millais fell in love, and Effie left Ruskin, causing a public scandal.

During April 1854, Effie filed her suit of nullity, on grounds of &quot;non-consummation&quot; owing to his &quot;incurable impotency&quot;, a charge Ruskin later disputed. Ruskin wrote, &quot;I can prove my virility at once.&quot; The annulment was granted in July. Ruskin did not even mention it in his diary. Effie married Millais the following year. The complex reasons for the non-consummation and ultimate failure of the Ruskin marriage are a matter of enduring speculation and debate.

Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti. He also provided an annuity of £150 in 1855–1857 to Elizabeth Siddal, Rossetti&#x27;s wife, to encourage her art (and paid for the services of Henry Acland for her medical care). Other artists influenced by the Pre-Raphaelites also received both critical and financial assistance from Ruskin, including John Brett, John William Inchbold, and Edward Burne-Jones, who became a good friend (he called him &quot;Brother Ned&quot;). His father&#x27;s disapproval of such friends was a further cause of tension between them.

During this period Ruskin wrote regular reviews of the annual exhibitions at the Royal Academy with the title &quot;Academy Notes&quot; (1855–1859, 1875). They were highly influential, capable of making or breaking reputations. The satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; published the lines (24 May 1856), &quot;I paints and paints,/hears no complaints/And sells before I&#x27;m dry,/Till savage Ruskin/He sticks his tusk in/Then nobody will buy.&quot;

Ruskin was an art-philanthropist: in March 1861 he gave 48 Turner drawings to the Ashmolean in Oxford, and a further 25 to the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge in May. Ruskin&#x27;s own work was very distinctive, and he occasionally exhibited his watercolours: in the United States in 1857–58 and 1879, for example; and in England, at the Fine Art Society in 1878, and at the Royal Society of Painters in Watercolour (of which he was an honorary member) in 1879. He created many careful studies of natural forms, based on his detailed botanical, geological and architectural observations. Examples of his work include a painted, floral pilaster decoration in the central room of Wallington Hall in Northumberland, home of his friend Pauline Trevelyan. The stained glass window in the &quot;Little Church of St Francis&quot; Funtley, Fareham, Hampshire is reputed to have been designed by him. Originally placed in the &quot;St. Peter&#x27;s Church&quot; Duntisbourne Abbots near Cirencester, the window depicts the Ascension and the Nativity.

Ruskin&#x27;s theories also inspired some architects to adapt the Gothic style. Such buildings created what has been called a distinctive &quot;Ruskinian Gothic&quot;. Through his friendship with Henry Acland, Ruskin supported attempts to establish what became the Oxford University Museum of Natural History (designed by Benjamin Woodward) — which is the closest thing to a model of this style, but still failed to satisfy Ruskin completely. The many twists and turns in the Museum&#x27;s development, not least its increasing cost, and the University authorities&#x27; less than enthusiastic attitude towards it, proved increasingly frustrating for Ruskin.

===Ruskin and education===
The Museum was part of a wider plan to improve science provision at Oxford, something the University initially resisted. Ruskin&#x27;s first formal teaching role came about in the mid-1850s, when he taught drawing classes (assisted by Dante Gabriel Rossetti) at the Working Men&#x27;s College, established by the Christian socialists, Frederick James Furnivall and Frederick Denison Maurice. Although Ruskin did not share the founders&#x27; politics, he strongly supported the idea that through education workers could achieve a crucially important sense of (self-)fulfilment. One result of this involvement was Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Drawing&quot; (1857). He had taught several women drawing, by means of correspondence, and his book represented both a response and a challenge to contemporary drawing manuals. The WMC was also a useful recruiting ground for assistants, on some of whom Ruskin would later come to rely, such as his future publisher, George Allen.

From 1859 until 1868, Ruskin was involved with the progressive school for girls at Winnington Hall in Cheshire. A frequent visitor, letter-writer, and donor of pictures and geological specimens to the school, Ruskin approved of the mixture of sports, handicrafts, music and dancing encouraged by its principal, Miss Bell. The association led to Ruskin&#x27;s sub-Socratic work, &quot;The Ethics of the Dust&quot; (1866), an imagined conversation with Winnington&#x27;s girls in which he cast himself as the &quot;Old Lecturer&quot;. On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it is a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, Whitelands College, a training college for teachers, where he instituted a May Queen festival that endures today. (It was also replicated in the 19th century at the Cork High School for Girls.) Ruskin also bestowed books and gemstones upon Somerville College, one of Oxford&#x27;s first two women&#x27;s colleges, which he visited regularly, and was similarly generous to other educational institutions for women.

===&quot;Modern Painters III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot;===
Both volumes III and IV of &quot;Modern Painters&quot; were published in 1856. In &quot;MP&quot; III Ruskin argued that all great art is &quot;the expression of the spirits of great men&quot;. Only the morally and spiritually healthy are capable of admiring the noble and the beautiful, and transforming them into great art by imaginatively penetrating their essence. &quot;MP&quot; IV presents the geology of the Alps in terms of landscape painting, and their moral and spiritual influence on those living nearby. The contrasting final chapters, &quot;The Mountain Glory&quot; and &quot;The Mountain Gloom&quot; provide an early example of Ruskin&#x27;s social analysis, highlighting the poverty of the peasants living in the lower Alps.

===Public lecturer===
In addition to leading more formal teaching classes, from the 1850s Ruskin became an increasingly popular public lecturer. His first public lectures were given in Edinburgh, in November 1853, on architecture and painting. His lectures at the Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester in 1857, were collected as &quot;The Political Economy of Art&quot; and later under Keats&#x27;s phrase, &quot;A Joy For Ever&quot;. In these lectures, Ruskin spoke about how to acquire art, and how to use it, arguing that England had forgotten that true wealth is virtue, and that art is an index of a nation&#x27;s well-being. Individuals have a responsibility to consume wisely, stimulating beneficent demand. The increasingly critical tone and political nature of Ruskin&#x27;s interventions outraged his father and the &quot;Manchester School&quot; of economists, as represented by a hostile review in the &quot;Manchester Examiner and Times&quot;. As the Ruskin scholar Helen Gill Viljoen noted, Ruskin was increasingly critical of his father, especially in letters written by Ruskin directly to him, many of them still unpublished.

Ruskin gave the inaugural address at the Cambridge School of Art in 1858, an institution from which the modern-day Anglia Ruskin University has grown. In &quot;The Two Paths&quot; (1859), five lectures given in London, Manchester, Bradford and Tunbridge Wells, Ruskin argued that a &#x27;vital law&#x27; underpins art and architecture, drawing on the labour theory of value. (For other addresses and letters, Cook and Wedderburn, vol. 16, pp. 427–87.) The year 1859 also marked his last tour of Europe with his ageing parents, during which they visited Germany and Switzerland.

===Turner Bequest===
Ruskin had been in Venice when he heard about Turner&#x27;s death in 1851. Being named an executor to Turner&#x27;s will was an honour that Ruskin respectfully declined, but later took up. Ruskin&#x27;s book in celebration of the sea, &quot;The Harbours of England&quot;, revolving around Turner&#x27;s drawings, was published in 1856. In January 1857, Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Notes on the Turner Gallery at Marlborough House, 1856&quot; was published. He persuaded the National Gallery to allow him to work on the Turner Bequest of nearly 20,000 individual artworks left to the nation by the artist. This involved Ruskin in an enormous amount of work, completed in May 1858, and involved cataloguing, framing and conserving. Four hundred watercolours were displayed in cabinets of Ruskin&#x27;s own design. Recent scholarship has argued that Ruskin did not, as previously thought, collude in the destruction of Turner&#x27;s erotic drawings, but his work on the Bequest did modify his attitude towards Turner. (See below, Controversies: Turner&#x27;s Erotic Drawings.)

===Religious &quot;unconversion&quot;===
In 1858, Ruskin was again travelling in Europe. The tour took him from Switzerland to Turin, where he saw Paolo Veronese&#x27;s &quot;Presentation of the Queen of Sheba&quot; at the Galleria Sabauda. He would later claim (in April 1877) that the discovery of this painting, contrasting starkly with a particularly dull sermon that he had listened to at a Waldensian church in Turin, led to his &quot;unconversion&quot; from Evangelical Christianity. He had, however, doubted his Evangelical Christian faith for some time, shaken by Biblical and geological scholarship that was claimed to have undermined the literal truth and absolute authority of the Bible: &quot;those dreadful hammers!&quot; he wrote to Henry Acland, &quot;I hear the chink of them at the end of every cadence of the Bible verses.&quot; This &quot;loss of faith&quot; precipitated a considerable personal crisis. His confidence undermined, he believed that much of his writing to date had been founded on a bed of lies and half-truths. He later returned to Christianity.

===Social critic and reformer: &quot;Unto This Last&quot;===
Although in 1877 Ruskin said that in 1860, &quot;I gave up my art work and wrote &quot;Unto This Last&quot;… the central work of my life&quot; the break was not so dramatic or final. Following his crisis of faith, and urged to political and economic work by his professed &quot;master&quot; Thomas Carlyle, to whom he acknowledged that he &quot;owed more than to any other living writer&quot;, Ruskin shifted his emphasis in the late 1850s from art towards social issues. Nevertheless, he continued to lecture on and write about a wide range of subjects including art and, among many other matters, geology (in June 1863 he lectured on the Alps), art practice and judgement (&quot;The Cestus of Aglaia&quot;), botany and mythology (&quot;Proserpina&quot; and &quot;The Queen of the Air&quot;). He continued to draw and paint in watercolours, and to travel extensively across Europe with servants and friends. In 1868, his tour took him to Abbeville, and in the following year he was in Verona (studying tombs for the Arundel Society) and Venice (where he was joined by William Holman Hunt). Yet increasingly Ruskin concentrated his energies on fiercely attacking industrial capitalism, and the utilitarian theories of political economy underpinning it. He repudiated his sometimes grandiloquent style, writing now in plainer, simpler language, to communicate his message straightforwardly. 

Ruskin authored several works on political economy. Ruskin&#x27;s social view broadened from concerns about the dignity of labour to consider issues of citizenship and notions of the ideal community. Just as he had questioned aesthetic orthodoxy in his earliest writings, he now dissected the orthodox political economy espoused by John Stuart Mill, based on theories of laissez-faire and competition drawn from the work of Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. In his four essays &quot;Unto This Last&quot;, Ruskin rejected the division of labour as dehumanising (separating the labourer from the product of his work), and argued that the false &quot;science&quot; of political economy failed to consider the social affections that bind communities together. He articulated an extended metaphor of household and family, drawing on Plato and Xenophon to demonstrate the communal and sometimes sacrificial nature of true economics. For Ruskin, all economies and societies are ideally founded on a politics of social justice. His ideas influenced the concept of the &quot;social economy&quot;, characterised by networks of charitable, co-operative and other non-governmental organisations.

The essays were originally published in consecutive monthly instalments of the new &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; between August and November 1860 (and published in a single volume in 1862). However, the &quot;Cornhill&quot;&#x27;s editor, William Makepeace Thackeray, was forced to abandon the series by the outcry of the magazine&#x27;s largely conservative readership and the fears of a nervous publisher (Smith, Elder &amp; Co.). The reaction of the national press was hostile, and Ruskin was, he claimed, &quot;reprobated in a violent manner&quot;. Ruskin&#x27;s father also strongly disapproved. Others were enthusiastic, including Carlyle, who wrote, &quot;I have read your Paper with exhilaration… Such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads… will do a great deal of good&quot;, declaring that they were &quot;henceforth in a minority of &quot;two&quot;&quot;, a notion which Ruskin seconded.

Ruskin&#x27;s political ideas, and &quot;Unto This Last&quot; in particular, later proved highly influential. The essays were praised and paraphrased in Gujarati by Mohandas Gandhi, a wide range of autodidacts cited their positive impact, the economist John A. Hobson and many of the founders of the British Labour party credited them as an influence.

Ruskin believed in a hierarchical social structure. He wrote &quot;I was, and my father was before me, a violent Tory of the old school.&quot; He believed in man&#x27;s duty to God, and while he sought to improve the conditions of the poor, he opposed attempts to level social differences and sought to resolve social inequalities by abandoning capitalism in favour of a co-operative structure of society based on obedience and benevolent philanthropy, rooted in the agricultural economy.

Ruskin&#x27;s explorations of nature and aesthetics in the fifth and final volume of &quot;Modern Painters&quot; focused on Giorgione, Veronese, Titian and Turner. Ruskin asserted that the components of the greatest artworks are held together, like human communities, in a quasi-organic unity. Competitive struggle is destructive. Uniting &quot;Modern Painters&quot; V and &quot;Unto This Last&quot; is Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Law of Help&quot;:

Ruskin&#x27;s next work on political economy, redefining some of the basic terms of the discipline, also ended prematurely, when &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, under the editorship of James Anthony Froude, cut short his &quot;Essays on Political Economy&quot; (1862–63) (later collected as &quot;Munera Pulveris&quot; (1872)). Ruskin further explored political themes in &quot;Time and Tide&quot; (1867), his letters to Thomas Dixon, a cork-cutter in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear who had a well-established interest in literary and artistic matters. In these letters, Ruskin promoted honesty in work and exchange, just relations in employment and the need for co-operation.

Ruskin&#x27;s sense of politics was not confined to theory. On his father&#x27;s death in 1864, he inherited an estate worth between £120,000 and £157,000 (the exact figure is disputed). This considerable fortune, inherited from the father he described on his tombstone as &quot;an entirely honest merchant&quot;, gave him the means to engage in personal philanthropy and practical schemes of social amelioration. One of his first actions was to support the housing work of Octavia Hill (originally one of his art pupils): he bought property in Marylebone to aid her philanthropic housing scheme. But Ruskin&#x27;s endeavours extended to the establishment of a shop selling pure tea in any quantity desired at 29 Paddington Street, Paddington (giving employment to two former Ruskin family servants) and crossing-sweepings to keep the area around the British Museum clean and tidy. Modest as these practical schemes were, they represented a symbolic challenge to the existing state of society. Yet his greatest practical experiments would come in his later years.

In 1865–66, Ruskin became involved in the controversy surrounding Edward John Eyre&#x27;s suppression of the Morant Bay rebellion. Mill formed the Jamaica Committee for the purpose of holding Governor Eyre accountable for what they perceived to be his unlawful, inhumane, and unnecessary quelling of the insurrection. In response, the Eyre Defence and Aid Fund was formed to support Eyre for having fulfilled his duty to defend order and save the white population from danger; Carlyle served as the chairman. Ruskin allied with the Defence, writing a letter which appeared in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in December 1865 (&quot;they are for Liberty, and I am for Lordship; they are Mob&#x27;s men, and I am a King&#x27;s man&quot;), donating £100 to the Fund, and giving a speech at Waterloo Place on Pall Mall in September 1866, also reported in the &quot;Telegraph&quot;. In addition to this, Ruskin &quot;threw himself into&quot; personal work for the Defence, &quot;enlisting recruits, persuading waverers, combating objections.&quot;

===Lectures in the 1860s===
Ruskin lectured widely in the 1860s, giving the Rede lecture at the University of Cambridge in 1867, for example. He spoke at the British Institution on &#x27;Modern Art&#x27;, the Working Men&#x27;s Institute, Camberwell on &quot;Work&quot; and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich on &#x27;War.&#x27; Ruskin&#x27;s widely admired lecture, &quot;Traffic&quot;, on the relation between taste and morality, was delivered in April 1864 at Bradford Town Hall, to which he had been invited because of a local debate about the style of a new Exchange building. &quot;I do not care about this Exchange&quot;, Ruskin told his audience, &quot;because &quot;you&quot; don&#x27;t!&quot; These last three lectures were published in &quot;The Crown of Wild Olive&quot; (1866).
The lectures that comprised &quot;Sesame and Lilies&quot; (published 1865), delivered in December 1864 at the town halls at Rusholme and Manchester, are essentially concerned with education and ideal conduct. &quot;Of Kings&#x27; Treasuries&quot; (in support of a library fund) explored issues of reading practice, literature (books of the hour vs. books of all time), cultural value and public education. &quot;Of Queens&#x27; Gardens&quot; (supporting a school fund) focused on the role of women, asserting their rights and duties in education, according them responsibility for the household and, by extension, for providing the human compassion that must balance a social order dominated by men. This book proved to be one of Ruskin&#x27;s most popular, and was regularly awarded as a Sunday School prize. Its reception over time, however, has been more mixed, and twentieth-century feminists have taken aim at &quot;Of Queens&#x27; Gardens&quot; in particular, as an attempt to &quot;subvert the new heresy&quot; of women&#x27;s rights by confining women to the domestic sphere. Although indeed subscribing to the Victorian belief in &quot;separate spheres&quot; for men and women, Ruskin was however unusual in arguing for parity of esteem, a case based on his philosophy that a nation&#x27;s political economy should be modelled on that of the ideal household.

==Later life (1869–1900)==

===Oxford&#x27;s first Slade Professor of Fine Art===

Ruskin was unanimously appointed the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford University in August 1869, though largely through the offices of his friend, Henry Acland. He delivered his inaugural lecture on his 51st birthday in 1870, at the Sheldonian Theatre to a larger-than-expected audience. It was here that he said, &quot;The art of any country is the exponent of its social and political virtues… she [England] must found colonies as fast and as far as she is able, formed of her most energetic and worthiest men;—seizing every piece of fruitful waste ground she can set her foot on…&quot; It has been claimed that Cecil Rhodes cherished a long-hand copy of the lecture, believing that it supported his own view of the British Empire.

In 1871, John Ruskin founded his own art school at Oxford, The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art. It was originally accommodated within the Ashmolean Museum but now occupies premises on High Street. Ruskin endowed the drawing mastership with £5000 of his own money. He also established a large collection of drawings, watercolours and other materials (over 800 frames) that he used to illustrate his lectures. The School challenged the orthodox, mechanical methodology of the government art schools (the &quot;South Kensington System&quot;).

Ruskin&#x27;s lectures were often so popular that they had to be given twice—once for the students, and again for the public. Most of them were eventually published (see Select Bibliography below). He lectured on a wide range of subjects at Oxford, his interpretation of &quot;Art&quot; encompassing almost every conceivable area of study, including wood and metal engraving (&quot;Ariadne Florentina&quot;), the relation of science to art (&quot;The Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;) and sculpture (&quot;Aratra Pentelici&quot;). His lectures ranged through myth, ornithology, geology, nature-study and literature. &quot;The teaching of Art…&quot;, Ruskin wrote, &quot;is the teaching of all things.&quot; Ruskin was never careful about offending his employer. When he criticised Michelangelo in a lecture in June 1871 it was seen as an attack on the large collection of that artist&#x27;s work in the Ashmolean Museum.

Most controversial, from the point of view of the University authorities, spectators and the national press, was the digging scheme on Ferry Hinksey Road at North Hinksey, near Oxford, instigated by Ruskin in 1874, and continuing into 1875, which involved undergraduates in a road-mending scheme. The scheme was motivated in part by a desire to teach the virtues of wholesome manual labour. Some of the diggers, who included Oscar Wilde, Alfred Milner and Ruskin&#x27;s future secretary and biographer W. G. Collingwood, were profoundly influenced by the experience: notably Arnold Toynbee, Leonard Montefiore and Alexander Robertson MacEwen. It helped to foster a public service ethic that was later given expression in the university settlements, and was keenly celebrated by the founders of Ruskin Hall, Oxford.

In 1879, Ruskin resigned from Oxford, but resumed his Professorship in 1883, only to resign again in 1884. He gave his reason as opposition to vivisection, but he had increasingly been in conflict with the University authorities, who refused to expand his Drawing School. He was also suffering from increasingly poor health.

===&quot;Fors Clavigera&quot; and the Whistler libel case===
In January 1871, the month before Ruskin started to lecture the wealthy undergraduates at Oxford University, he began his series of 96 (monthly) &quot;letters to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain&quot; under the title &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot; (1871–84). (The letters were published irregularly after the 87th instalment in March 1878.) These letters were personal, dealt with every subject in his oeuvre, and were written in a variety of styles, reflecting his mood and circumstances. From 1873, Ruskin had full control over all his publications, having established George Allen as his sole publisher (see Allen &amp; Unwin).
In the July 1877 letter of &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot;, Ruskin launched a scathing attack on paintings by James McNeill Whistler exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery. He found particular fault with &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket&quot;, and accused Whistler of asking two hundred guineas for &quot;flinging a pot of paint in the public&#x27;s face&quot;. Whistler filed a libel suit against Ruskin, but Ruskin was ill when the case went to trial in November 1878, so the artist Edward Burne-Jones and Attorney General Sir John Holker represented him. The trial took place on 25 and 26 November, and many major figures of the art world at the time appeared at the trial. Artist Albert Moore appeared as a witness for Whistler, and artist William Powell Frith appeared for Ruskin. Frith said &quot;the nocturne in black in gold is not in my opinion worth two hundred guineas&quot;. Frederic Leighton also agreed to give evidence for Whistler, but in the end could not attend as he had to go to Windsor to be knighted. Edward Burne-Jones, representing Ruskin, also asserted that &quot;Nocturne in Black and Gold&quot; was not a serious work of art. When asked to give reasons, Burne-Jones said he had never seen one painting of night that was successful, but also acknowledged that he saw marks of great labour and artistic skill in the painting. In the end, Whistler won the case, but the jury awarded damages of only a derisory farthing (the smallest coin of the realm) to the artist. Court costs were split between the two parties. Ruskin&#x27;s were paid by public subscription organised by the Fine Art Society, but Whistler was bankrupt within six months, and was forced to sell his house on Tite Street in London and move to Venice. The episode tarnished Ruskin&#x27;s reputation and may have accelerated his mental decline. It did nothing to mitigate Ruskin&#x27;s exaggerated sense of failure in persuading his readers to share in his own keenly felt priorities.

===Guild of St George===

Ruskin founded his utopian society, the Guild of St George, in 1871 (although originally it was called St George&#x27;s Fund, and then St George&#x27;s Company, before becoming the Guild in 1878). Its aims and objectives were articulated in &quot;Fors Clavigera&quot;. A communitarian protest against nineteenth-century industrial capitalism, it had a hierarchical structure, with Ruskin as its Master, and dedicated members called &quot;Companions&quot;. Ruskin wished to show that contemporary life could still be enjoyed in the countryside, with land being farmed by traditional means, in harmony with the environment, and with the minimum of mechanical assistance. He also sought to educate and enrich the lives of industrial workers by inspiring them with beautiful objects. Toward this end, with a tithe (or personal donation) of £7,000, Ruskin acquired land and a collection of art treasures.

Ruskin purchased land initially in Totley, near Sheffield, but the agricultural scheme established there by local communists met with only modest success after many difficulties. Donations of land from wealthy and dedicated Companions eventually placed land and property in the Guild&#x27;s care: in the Wyre Forest, near Bewdley, Worcestershire, called Ruskin Land today; Barmouth, in Gwynedd, north-west Wales; Cloughton, in North Yorkshire; Westmill in Hertfordshire; and Sheepscombe, Gloucestershire.

In principle, Ruskin worked out a scheme for different grades of &quot;Companion&quot;, wrote codes of practice, described styles of dress and even designed the Guild&#x27;s own coins. Ruskin wished to see St George&#x27;s Schools established, and published various volumes to aid its teaching (his &quot;Bibliotheca Pastorum&quot; or &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Library&quot;), but the schools themselves were never established. (In the 1880s, in a venture loosely related to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, he supported Francesca Alexander&#x27;s publication of some of her tales of peasant life.) In reality, the Guild, which still exists today as a charitable education trust, has only ever operated on a small scale.

Ruskin also wished to see traditional rural handicrafts revived. St. George&#x27;s Mill was established at Laxey, Isle of Man, producing cloth goods. The Guild also encouraged independent but allied efforts in spinning and weaving at Langdale, in other parts of the Lake District and elsewhere, producing linen and other goods exhibited by the Home Arts and Industries Association and similar organisations.

The Guild&#x27;s most conspicuous and enduring achievement was the creation of a remarkable collection of art, minerals, books, medieval manuscripts, architectural casts, coins and other precious and beautiful objects. Housed in a cottage museum high on a hill in the Sheffield district of Walkley, it opened in 1875, and was curated by Henry and Emily Swan. Ruskin had written in &quot;Modern Painters&quot; III (1856) that, &quot;the greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to &quot;see&quot; something, and to tell what it &quot;saw&quot; in a plain way.&quot; Through the Museum, Ruskin aimed to bring to the eyes of the working man many of the sights and experiences otherwise reserved for those who could afford to travel across Europe. The original Museum has been digitally recreated online. In 1890, the Museum relocated to Meersbrook Park. The collection is now on display at Sheffield&#x27;s Millennium Gallery.

===Rose La Touche===

Ruskin had been introduced to the wealthy Irish La Touche family by Louisa, Marchioness of Waterford. Maria La Touche, a minor Irish poet and novelist, asked Ruskin to teach her daughters drawing and painting in 1858. Rose La Touche was ten. His first meeting came at a time when Ruskin&#x27;s own religious faith was under strain. This always caused difficulties for the staunchly Protestant La Touche family who at various times prevented the two from meeting. A chance meeting at the Royal Academy in 1869 was one of the few occasions they came into personal contact. After a long illness, she died on 25 May 1875, at the age of 27. These events plunged Ruskin into despair and led to increasingly severe bouts of mental illness involving breakdowns and delirious visions. The first of these had occurred in 1871 at Matlock, Derbyshire, a town and a county that he knew from his boyhood travels, whose flora, fauna, and minerals helped to form and reinforce his appreciation and understanding of nature.

Ruskin turned to spiritualism. He attended séances at Broadlands. Ruskin&#x27;s increasing need to believe in a meaningful universe and a life after death, both for himself and his loved ones, helped to revive his Christian faith in the 1870s.

===Travel guides===
Ruskin continued to travel, studying the landscapes, buildings and art of Europe. In May 1870 and June 1872 he admired Carpaccio&#x27;s &quot;St Ursula&quot; in Venice, a vision of which, associated with Rose La Touche, would haunt him, described in the pages of &quot;Fors&quot;. In 1874, on his tour of Italy, Ruskin visited Sicily, the furthest he ever travelled.

Ruskin embraced the emerging literary forms, the travel guide (and gallery guide), writing new works, and adapting old ones &quot;to give&quot;, he said, &quot;what guidance I may to travellers…&quot; &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot; was revised, edited and issued in a new &quot;Travellers&#x27; Edition&quot; in 1879. Ruskin directed his readers, the would-be traveller, to look with his cultural gaze at the landscapes, buildings and art of France and Italy: &quot;Mornings in Florence&quot; (1875–1877), &quot;The Bible of Amiens&quot; (1880–1885) (a close study of its sculpture and a wider history), &quot;St Mark&#x27;s Rest&quot; (1877–1884) and &quot;A Guide to the Principal Pictures in… Venice&quot; (1877).

===Final writings===

In the 1880s, Ruskin returned to some literature and themes that had been among his favourites since childhood. He wrote about Scott, Byron and Wordsworth in &quot;Fiction, Fair and Foul&quot; (1880) in which, as Seth Reno argues, he describes the devastating effects on the landscape caused by industrialization, a vision Reno sees as a realization of the Anthropocene. He returned to meteorological observations in his lectures, &quot;The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth-Century&quot; (1884), describing the apparent effects of industrialisation on weather patterns. Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Storm-Cloud&quot; has been seen as foreshadowing environmentalism and related concerns in the 20th and 21st centuries. Ruskin&#x27;s prophetic writings were also tied to his emotions, and his more general (ethical) dissatisfaction with the modern world with which he now felt almost completely out of sympathy.

His last great work was his autobiography, &quot;Praeterita&quot; (1885–1889) (meaning, &#x27;Of Past Things&#x27;), a highly personalised, selective, eloquent but incomplete account of aspects of his life, the preface of which was written in his childhood nursery at Herne Hill.

The period from the late 1880s was one of steady and inexorable decline. Gradually it became too difficult for him to travel to Europe. He suffered a complete mental collapse on his final tour, which included Beauvais, Sallanches and Venice, in 1888. The emergence and dominance of the Aesthetic movement and Impressionism distanced Ruskin from the modern art world, his ideas on the social utility of art contrasting with the doctrine of &quot;l&#x27;art pour l&#x27;art&quot; or &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; that was beginning to dominate. His later writings were increasingly seen as irrelevant, especially as he seemed to be more interested in book illustrators such as Kate Greenaway than in modern art. He also attacked aspects of Darwinian theory with increasing violence, although he knew and respected Darwin personally.

===Brantwood and final years===

In August 1871, Ruskin purchased, from W. J. Linton, the then somewhat dilapidated Brantwood house, on the shores of Coniston Water, in the English Lake District, paying £1500 for it. Brantwood was Ruskin&#x27;s main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site for more of his practical schemes and experiments: he had an ice house built, and the gardens comprehensively rearranged. He oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the &quot;Jumping Jenny&quot;), and he altered the house (adding a dining room, a turret to his bedroom to give him a panoramic view of the lake, and he later extended the property to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream and craggy rocks rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.

Although Ruskin&#x27;s 80th birthday was widely celebrated in 1899 (various Ruskin societies presenting him with an elaborately illuminated congratulatory address), Ruskin was scarcely aware of it. He died at Brantwood from influenza on 20 January 1900 at the age of 80. He was buried five days later in the churchyard at Coniston, according to his wishes. As he had grown weaker, suffering prolonged bouts of mental illness, he had been looked after by his second cousin, Joan(na) Severn (formerly &quot;companion&quot; to Ruskin&#x27;s mother) and she and her family inherited his estate. &quot;Joanna&#x27;s Care&quot; was the eloquent final chapter of Ruskin&#x27;s memoir, which he dedicated to her as a fitting tribute.

Joan Severn, together with Ruskin&#x27;s secretary, W. G. Collingwood, and his eminent American friend Charles Eliot Norton, were executors to his will. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn edited the monumental 39-volume &quot;Library Edition&quot; of Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;, the last volume of which, an index, attempts to demonstrate the complex interconnectedness of Ruskin&#x27;s thought. They all acted together to guard, and even control, Ruskin&#x27;s public and personal reputation.

The centenary of Ruskin&#x27;s birth was keenly celebrated in 1919, but his reputation was already in decline and sank further in the fifty years that followed. The contents of Ruskin&#x27;s home were dispersed in a series of sales at auction, and Brantwood itself was bought in 1932 by the educationist and Ruskin enthusiast, collector and memorialist, John Howard Whitehouse.

Brantwood was opened in 1934 as a memorial to Ruskin and remains open to the public today. The Guild of St George continues to thrive as an educational charity, and has an international membership. The Ruskin Society organises events throughout the year. A series of public celebrations of Ruskin&#x27;s multiple legacies took place in 2000, on the centenary of his death, and events are planned throughout 2019, to mark the bicentenary of his birth.

===Note on Ruskin&#x27;s personal appearance===

In middle age, and at his prime as a lecturer, Ruskin was described as slim, perhaps a little short, with an aquiline nose and brilliant, piercing blue eyes. Often sporting a double-breasted waistcoat, a high collar and, when necessary, a frock coat, he also wore his trademark blue neckcloth. From 1878 he cultivated an increasingly long beard, and took on the appearance of an &quot;Old Testament&quot; prophet.

===Ruskin in the eyes of a student===
The following description of Ruskin as a lecturer was written by an eyewitness, who was a student at the time (1884):

An incident where the Arts and Crafts master William Morris had aroused the anger of Dr Bright, Master of University College, Oxford, served to demonstrate Ruskin&#x27;s charisma:

==Legacy==
===International===
Ruskin&#x27;s influence reached across the world. Tolstoy described him as &quot;one of the most remarkable men not only of England and of our generation, but of all countries and times&quot; and quoted extensively from him, rendering his ideas into Russian. Proust not only admired Ruskin but helped translate his works into French, describing him as &quot;for me one of the greatest writers of all times and of all countries&quot;. Gandhi wrote of the &quot;magic spell&quot; cast on him by &quot;Unto This Last&quot; and paraphrased the work in Gujarati, calling it &quot;Sarvodaya&quot;, &quot;The Advancement of All&quot;. In Japan, Ryuzo Mikimoto actively collaborated in Ruskin&#x27;s translation. He commissioned sculptures and sundry commemorative items, and incorporated Ruskinian rose motifs in the jewellery produced by his cultured pearl empire. He established the Ruskin Society of Tokyo and his children built a dedicated library to house his Ruskin collection.

A number of utopian socialist Ruskin Colonies attempted to put his political ideals into practice. These communities included Ruskin, Florida, Ruskin, British Columbia and the Ruskin Commonwealth Association, a colony in Dickson County, Tennessee in existence from 1894 to 1899. One of Ruskin&#x27;s students, Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead, founded the Byrdcliffe Colony in Woodstock, New York, partly inspired by his teacher&#x27;s beliefs.

Ruskin&#x27;s work has been translated into numerous languages including, in addition to those already mentioned (Russian, French, Japanese): German, Italian, Catalan, Spanish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Czech, Chinese, Welsh, Esperanto, Gikuyu, and several Indian languages such as Kannada.

===Art, architecture and literature===
Theorists and practitioners in a broad range of disciplines acknowledged their debt to Ruskin. Architects including Le Corbusier, Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright and Walter Gropius incorporated his ideas in their work. Writers as diverse as Oscar Wilde, G. K. Chesterton, Hilaire Belloc, T. S. Eliot, W. B. Yeats and Ezra Pound felt Ruskin&#x27;s influence. The American poet Marianne Moore was an enthusiastic Ruskin reader. Art historians and critics, among them Herbert Read, Roger Fry and Wilhelm Worringer, knew Ruskin&#x27;s work well. Admirers ranged from the British-born American watercolourist and engraver John William Hill to the sculptor-designer, printmaker and utopianist Eric Gill. Explorer Edward Wilson used his works as an influence as while painting scientific and artistic sketches and watercolours of the Terra Nova Expedition. Aside from E. T. Cook, Ruskin&#x27;s editor and biographer, other leading British journalists influenced by Ruskin include J. A. Spender, and the war correspondent H. W. Nevinson.

===Craft and conservation===
William Morris and C. R. Ashbee (of the Guild of Handicraft) were keen disciples, and through them Ruskin&#x27;s legacy can be traced in the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin&#x27;s ideas on the preservation of open spaces and the conservation of historic buildings and places inspired his friends Octavia Hill and Hardwicke Rawnsley to help found the National Trust.

===Society, education and sport===
Pioneers of town planning such as Thomas Coglan Horsfall and Patrick Geddes called Ruskin an inspiration and invoked his ideas in justification of their own social interventions; likewise the founders of the garden city movement, Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin.

Edward Carpenter&#x27;s community in Millthorpe, Derbyshire was partly inspired by Ruskin, and John Kenworthy&#x27;s colony at Purleigh, Essex, which was briefly a refuge for the Doukhobors, combined Ruskin&#x27;s ideas and Tolstoy&#x27;s.

The most prolific collector of Ruskiniana was John Howard Whitehouse, who saved Ruskin&#x27;s home, Brantwood, and opened it as a permanent Ruskin memorial. Inspired by Ruskin&#x27;s educational ideals, Whitehouse established Bembridge School, on the Isle of Wight, and ran it along Ruskinian lines. Educationists from William Jolly to Michael Ernest Sadler wrote about and appreciated Ruskin&#x27;s ideas. Ruskin College, an educational establishment in Oxford originally intended for working men, was named after him by its American founders, Walter Vrooman and Charles A. Beard.

Ruskin&#x27;s innovative publishing experiment, conducted by his one-time Working Men&#x27;s College pupil George Allen, whose business was eventually merged to become Allen &amp; Unwin, anticipated the establishment of the Net Book Agreement.

Ruskin&#x27;s Drawing Collection, a collection of 1470 works of art he gathered as learning aids for the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (which he founded at Oxford), is at the Ashmolean Museum. The Museum has promoted Ruskin&#x27;s art teaching, utilising the collection for in-person and online drawing courses.

Pierre de Coubertin, the innovator of the modern Olympic Games, cited Ruskin&#x27;s principles of beautification, asserting that the games should be &quot;Ruskinised&quot; to create an aesthetic identity that transcended mere championship competitions.

=== Politics and critique of political economy ===
Ruskin was an inspiration for many Christian socialists, and his ideas informed the work of economists such as William Smart and J. A. Hobson, and the positivist Frederic Harrison. Ruskin was discussed in university extension classes, and in reading circles and societies formed in his name. He helped to inspire the settlement movement in Britain and the United States. Resident workers at Toynbee Hall such as the future civil servants Hubert Llewellyn Smith and William Beveridge (author of the Report … on Social Insurance and Allied Services), and the future Prime Minister Clement Attlee acknowledged their debt to Ruskin as they helped to found the British welfare state. More of the British Labour Party&#x27;s earliest MPs acknowledged Ruskin&#x27;s influence than mentioned Karl Marx or the Bible. In Nazi Germany, Ruskin was seen as an early British National Socialist. William Montgomery McGovern&#x27;s &quot;From Luther to Hitler&quot; (1941) identified Ruskin as a thinker who made Nazism possible, and one 1930s German headmaster told his students that &quot;Carlyle and Ruskin were the first National Socialists.&quot; More recently, Ruskin&#x27;s works have also influenced Phillip Blond and the Red Tory movement.

===Ruskin in the 21st century===
In 2019, Ruskin200 was inaugurated as a year-long celebration marking the bicentenary of Ruskin&#x27;s birth.

Admirers and scholars of Ruskin can visit the Ruskin Library at Lancaster University, Ruskin&#x27;s home, Brantwood, and the Ruskin Museum, both in Coniston in the English Lake District. All three mount regular exhibitions open to the public all the year round. Barony House in Edinburgh is home to a descendant of John Ruskin. She has designed and hand painted various friezes in honour of her ancestor and it is open to the public. Ruskin&#x27;s Guild of St George continues his work today, in education, the arts, crafts, and the rural economy.
Many streets, buildings, organisations and institutions bear his name: The Priory Ruskin Academy in Grantham, Lincolnshire; John Ruskin College, South Croydon; and Anglia Ruskin University in Chelmsford and Cambridge, which traces its origins to the Cambridge School of Art, at the foundation of which Ruskin spoke in 1858. Also, the Ruskin Literary and Debating Society, (founded in 1900 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), the oldest surviving club of its type, and still promoting the development of literary knowledge and public speaking today; and the Ruskin Art Club in Los Angeles, which still exists. In addition, there is the Ruskin Pottery, Ruskin House, Croydon and Ruskin Hall at the University of Pittsburgh.

Ruskin, Florida, United States—site of one of the short-lived American Ruskin Colleges—is named after John Ruskin. There is a mural of Ruskin titled &quot;Head, Heart and Hands&quot; on a building across from the Ruskin Post Office.

Since 2000, scholarly research has focused on aspects of Ruskin&#x27;s legacy, including his impact on the sciences; John Lubbock and Oliver Lodge admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin&#x27;s links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist David Gauntlett argues that Ruskin&#x27;s notions of craft can be felt today in online communities such as YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin&#x27;s understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.

Notable Ruskin enthusiasts include the writers Geoffrey Hill and Charles Tomlinson, and the politicians Patrick Cormack, Frank Judd, Frank Field and Tony Benn. In 2006, Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury, Raficq Abdulla, Jonathon Porritt and Nicholas Wright were among those to contribute to the symposium, &quot;There is no wealth but life: Ruskin in the 21st Century&quot;. Jonathan Glancey at &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Andrew Hill at the &quot;Financial Times&quot; have both written about Ruskin, as has the broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. In 2015, inspired by Ruskin&#x27;s philosophy of education, Marc Turtletaub founded &quot;Meristem&quot; in Fair Oaks, California. The centre educates adolescents with developmental differences using Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;land and craft&quot; ideals, transitioning them so they will succeed as adults in an evolving post-industrial society.

==Theory and criticism==

Ruskin wrote over 250 works, initially art criticism and history, but expanding to cover topics ranging over science, geology, ornithology, literary criticism, the environmental effects of pollution, mythology, travel, political economy and social reform. After his death Ruskin&#x27;s works were collected in the 39-volume &quot;Library Edition&quot;, completed in 1912 by his friends Edward Tyas Cook and Alexander Wedderburn. The range and quantity of Ruskin&#x27;s writing, and its complex, allusive and associative method of expression, cause certain difficulties. In 1898, John A. Hobson observed that in attempting to summarise Ruskin&#x27;s thought, and by extracting passages from across his work, &quot;the spell of his eloquence is broken&quot;. Clive Wilmer has written, further, that, &quot;The anthologising of short purple passages, removed from their intended contexts [… is] something which Ruskin himself detested and which has bedevilled his reputation from the start.&quot; Nevertheless, some aspects of Ruskin&#x27;s theory and criticism require further consideration.

===Art and design criticism===
Ruskin&#x27;s early work defended the reputation of J. M. W. Turner. He believed that all great art should communicate an understanding and appreciation of nature. Accordingly, inherited artistic conventions should be rejected. Only by means of direct observation can an artist, through form and colour, represent nature in art. He advised artists in &quot;Modern Painters&quot; I to: &quot;go to Nature in all singleness of heart… rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and scorning nothing.&quot; By the 1850s. Ruskin was celebrating the Pre-Raphaelites, whose members, he said, had formed &quot;a new and noble school&quot; of art that would provide a basis for a thoroughgoing reform of the art world. For Ruskin, art should communicate truth above all things. However, this could not be revealed by mere display of skill, and must be an expression of the artist&#x27;s whole moral outlook. Ruskin rejected the work of Whistler because he considered it to epitomise a reductive mechanisation of art.

Ruskin&#x27;s strong rejection of Classical tradition in &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot; typifies the inextricable mix of aesthetics and morality in his thought: &quot;Pagan in its origin, proud and unholy in its revival, paralysed in its old age… an architecture invented, as it seems, to make plagiarists of its architects, slaves of its workmen, and sybarites of its inhabitants; an architecture in which intellect is idle, invention impossible, but in which all luxury is gratified and all insolence fortified.&quot; Rejection of mechanisation and standardisation informed Ruskin&#x27;s theories of architecture, and his emphasis on the importance of the Medieval Gothic style. He praised the Gothic for what he saw as its reverence for nature and natural forms; the free, unfettered expression of artisans constructing and decorating buildings; and for the organic relationship he perceived between worker and guild, worker and community, worker and natural environment, and between worker and God. Attempts in the 19th century to reproduce Gothic forms (such as pointed arches), attempts he had helped inspire, were not enough to make these buildings expressions of what Ruskin saw as true Gothic feeling, faith, and organicism.

For Ruskin, the Gothic style in architecture embodied the same moral truths he sought to promote in the visual arts. It expressed the &#x27;meaning&#x27; of architecture—as a combination of the values of strength, solidity and aspiration—all written, as it were, in stone. For Ruskin, creating true Gothic architecture involved the whole community, and expressed the full range of human emotions, from the effects of soaring spires to the comically ridiculous carved grotesques and gargoyles. Even its crude and &quot;savage&quot; aspects were proof of &quot;the liberty of every workman who struck the stone; a freedom of thought, and rank in scale of being, such as no laws, no charters, no charities can secure.&quot; Classical architecture, in contrast, expressed a morally vacuous and repressive standardisation. Ruskin associated Classical values with modern developments, in particular with the demoralising consequences of the Industrial Revolution, resulting in buildings such as The Crystal Palace, which he criticised. Although Ruskin wrote about architecture in many works over the course of his career, his much-anthologised essay &quot;The Nature of Gothic&quot; from the second volume of &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot; (1853) is widely considered to be one of his most important and evocative discussions of his central argument.

Ruskin&#x27;s theories indirectly encouraged a revival of Gothic styles, but Ruskin himself was often dissatisfied with the results. He objected that forms of mass-produced &quot;faux&quot; Gothic did not exemplify his principles, but showed disregard for the true meaning of the style. Even the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, a building designed with Ruskin&#x27;s collaboration, met with his disapproval. The O&#x27;Shea brothers, freehand stone carvers chosen to revive the creative &quot;freedom of thought&quot; of Gothic craftsmen, disappointed him by their lack of reverence for the task.

Ruskin&#x27;s distaste for oppressive standardisation led to later works in which he attacked &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism, which he thought was at its root. His ideas provided inspiration for the Arts and Crafts Movement, the founders of the National Trust, the National Art Collections Fund, and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.

Ruskin&#x27;s views on art, wrote Kenneth Clark, &quot;cannot be made to form a logical system, and perhaps owe to this fact a part of their value.&quot; Ruskin&#x27;s accounts of art are descriptions of a superior type that conjure images vividly in the mind&#x27;s eye.
Clark neatly summarises the key features of Ruskin&#x27;s writing on art and architecture:

# Art is not a matter of taste, but involves the whole man. Whether in making or perceiving a work of art, we bring to bear on it feeling, intellect, morals, knowledge, memory, and every other human capacity, all focused in a flash on a single point. Aesthetic man is a concept as false and dehumanising as economic man.
# Even the most superior mind and the most powerful imagination must found itself on facts, which must be recognised for what they are. The imagination will often reshape them in a way which the prosaic mind cannot understand; but this recreation will be based on facts, not on formulas or illusions.
# These facts must be perceived by the senses, or felt; not learnt.
# The greatest artists and schools of art have believed it their duty to impart vital truths, not only about the facts of vision, but about religion and the conduct of life.
# Beauty of form is revealed in organisms which have developed perfectly according to their laws of growth, and so give, in his own words, &#x27;the appearance of felicitous fulfilment of function.&#x27;
# This fulfilment of function depends on all parts of an organism cohering and co-operating. This was what he called the &#x27;Law of Help,&#x27; one of Ruskin&#x27;s fundamental beliefs, extending from nature and art to society.
# Good art is done with enjoyment. The artist must feel that, within certain reasonable limits, he is free, that he is wanted by society, and that the ideas he is asked to express are true and important.
# Great art is the expression of epochs where people are united by a common faith and a common purpose, accept their laws, believe in their leaders, and take a serious view of human destiny.
===Historic preservation ===
Ruskin&#x27;s belief in preservation of ancient buildings had a significant influence on later thinking about the distinction between conservation and restoration. His position at the beginning of his career was very radical and he believed that if no conservation had been done on a building it should be left to die. In &quot;The Seven Lamps of Architecture&quot;, (1849) Ruskin wrote:

For Ruskin, the &quot;age&quot; of a building was crucially significant as an aspect in its preservation: &quot;For, indeed, the greatest glory of a building is not in its stones, not in its gold. Its glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysterious sympathy, nay, even of approval or condemnation, which we feel in walls that have long been washed by the passing waves of humanity.&quot;

It has been thought that he was a strong proponent of his contemporary, Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, who promoted the view that &quot;if no conservation had been done [to] a building it should be restored&quot;. In fact, Ruskin never criticised Viollet-le-Duc&#x27;s restoration work, just the idea of restoration. Ruskin&#x27;s radical position on restoration became more nuanced at the end of his life, as he wrote in his last book, &quot;Praeterita&quot;, that &quot;he regretted that no one in England had done the work that Viollet-le-Duc had done in France&quot;.

===Critique of political economy===
Ruskin wielded a critique of political economy of orthodox, 19th-century political economy principally on the grounds that it failed to acknowledge complexities of human desires and motivations (broadly, &quot;social affections&quot;). He began to express such ideas in &quot;The Stones of Venice&quot;, and increasingly in works of the later 1850s, such as &quot;The Political Economy of Art&quot; (&quot;A Joy for Ever&quot;), but he gave them full expression in the influential and at the time of publication, very controversial essays, &quot;Unto This Last&quot;.


At the root of his theory, was Ruskin&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the role and position of the worker, and especially the artisan or craftsman, in modern industrial capitalist society. Ruskin believed that the economic theories of Adam Smith, expressed in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; had led, through the division of labour to the alienation of the worker not merely from the process of work itself, but from his fellow workmen and other classes, causing increasing resentment.

Ruskin argued that one remedy would be to pay work at a fixed rate of wages, because human need is consistent and a given quantity of work justly demands a certain return. The best workmen would remain in employment because of the quality of their work (a focus on quality growing out of his writings on art and architecture). The best workmen could not, in a fixed-wage economy, be undercut by an inferior worker or product.

In the preface to &quot;Unto This Last&quot; (1862), Ruskin recommended that the state should underwrite standards of service and production to guarantee social justice. This included the recommendation of government youth-training schools promoting employment, health, and &#x27;gentleness and justice&#x27;; government manufactories and workshops; government schools for the employment at fixed wages of the unemployed, with idlers compelled to toil; and pensions provided for the elderly and the destitute, as a matter of right, received honourably and not in shame. Many of these ideas were later incorporated into the welfare state.

== Controversies ==

===Turner&#x27;s erotic drawings===
Until 2005, biographies of both J. M. W. Turner and Ruskin had claimed that in 1858 Ruskin burned bundles of erotic paintings and drawings by Turner to protect Turner&#x27;s posthumous reputation. Ruskin&#x27;s friend Ralph Nicholson Wornum, who was Keeper of the National Gallery, was said to have colluded in the alleged destruction of Turner&#x27;s works. In 2005, these works, which form part of the Turner Bequest held at Tate Britain, were re-appraised by Turner Curator Ian Warrell, who concluded that Ruskin and Wornum had not destroyed them.

===Sexuality===
Ruskin&#x27;s sexuality has been the subject of a great deal of speculation. He was married once, to Effie Gray, whom he met when she was 12 and he was 21, and Gray&#x27;s family encouraged a match between the two when she had matured. The marriage was annulled after six years owing to non-consummation. Effie, in a letter to her parents, claimed that Ruskin found her &quot;person&quot; repugnant: He alleged various reasons, hatred of children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and finally this last year he told me his true reason… that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April [1848]. Ruskin told his lawyer during the annulment proceedings: It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it. The cause of Ruskin&#x27;s &quot;disgust&quot; has led to much conjecture. Mary Lutyens speculated that he rejected Effie because he was horrified by the sight of her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of nudes which lacked pubic hair. However, Peter Fuller wrote, &quot;It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife&#x27;s pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood.&quot; Ruskin&#x27;s biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also took the view that menstruation was the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. There is no evidence to support any of these theories. William Ewart Gladstone said to his daughter Mary, &quot;should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin [for the breakdown of the marriage], remember that there is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.&quot; Ruskins&#x27; marriage is the subject of a book by Robert Brownell.

Ruskin&#x27;s later relationship with Rose La Touche began on 3 January 1858, when she was 10 years old and he was about to turn 39. He was her private art tutor, and the two maintained an educational relationship through correspondence until she was 18. Around that time he asked her to marry him. However, Rose&#x27;s parents forbade it, after learning about his first marriage. Ruskin repeated his marriage proposal when Rose became 21, and legally free to decide for herself. She was willing to marry if the union would remain unconsummated, because her doctors had told her she was unfit for marriage; but Ruskin declined to enter another such marriage for fear of its effect on his reputation.

Ruskin is not known to have had any sexually intimate relationships. During an episode of mental derangement after Rose died, he wrote a letter in which he insisted that Rose&#x27;s spirit had instructed him to marry a girl who was visiting him at the time. It is also true that in letters from Ruskin to Kate Greenaway he asked her to draw her &quot;girlies&quot; (as he called her child figures) without clothing:
Will you – (it&#x27;s all for your own good – !) make her stand up and then draw her for me without a cap – and, without her shoes, – (because of the heels) and without her mittens, and without her – frock and frills? And let me see exactly how tall she is – and – how – round. It will be so good of and for you – And to and for me.
In a letter to his physician John Simon on 15 May 1886, Ruskin wrote:
I like my girls from ten to sixteen—allowing of 17 or 18 as long as they&#x27;re not in love with anybody but me.—I&#x27;ve got some darlings of 8—12—14—just now, and my Pigwiggina here—12—who fetches my wood and is learning to play my bells.
Ruskin&#x27;s biographers disagree about the allegation of &quot;paedophilia&quot;. Tim Hilton, in his two-volume biography, asserts that Ruskin &quot;was a paedophile&quot;, alluding by way of explanation to a sensual description by Ruskin of a half-naked girl he saw in Italy and quoting Ruskin&#x27;s own statements about his liking for young girls, while John Batchelor argues that the term is inappropriate because Ruskin&#x27;s behaviour does not &quot;fit the profile&quot;. Others point to a definite pattern of &quot;nympholeptic&quot; behaviour with regard to his interactions with girls at a Winnington school. However, there is no evidence that Ruskin ever engaged in any sexual activity with anyone at all. According to one interpretation, what Ruskin valued most in pre-pubescent girls was their innocence; the fact that they were not (yet) fully sexually developed. However, James L. Spates describes Ruskin&#x27;s erotic life as simply &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; and concludes that he &quot;was physically and emotionally normal&quot;. The age of consent in the United Kingdom was 12 for females until 1875 and then raised to 16 in 1885, having been 13 in Great Britain between those dates.

===Common law of business balance===
Ruskin was not a fan of buying low and selling high. In the &quot;Veins of Wealth&quot; section of &quot;Unto This Last&quot;, he wrote: &quot;So far as I know, there is not in history record of anything so disgraceful to the human intellect as the modern idea that the commercial text, &#x27;Buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest,&#x27; represents, or under any circumstances could represent, an available principle of national economy.&quot; Perhaps due to such passages, Ruskin is frequently identified as the originator of the &quot;common law of business balance&quot;—a statement about the relationships of price and quality as they pertain to manufactured goods, and often summarised as: &quot;The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot.&quot; This is the core of a longer statement usually attributed to Ruskin, although Ruskin&#x27;s authorship is disputed among Ruskin scholars. Fred Shapiro maintains that the statement does not appear anywhere in Ruskin&#x27;s works, and George Landow is likewise sceptical of the claim of Ruskin&#x27;s authorship. In a posting of the &quot;Ruskin Library News&quot;, a blog associated with the Ruskin Library (a major collection of Ruskiniana located at Lancaster University), an anonymous library staff member briefly mentions the statement and its widespread use, saying that, &quot;This is one of many quotations ascribed to Ruskin, without there being any trace of them in his writings – although someone, somewhere, thought they sounded like Ruskin.&quot; In an issue of the journal &quot;Heat Transfer Engineering&quot;, Kenneth Bell quotes the statement and mentions that it has been attributed to Ruskin. While Bell believes in the veracity of its content, he adds that the statement does not appear in Ruskin&#x27;s published works.

Early in the 20th century, this statement appeared—without any authorship attribution—in magazine advertisements, in a business catalogue, in student publications, and, occasionally, in editorial columns. Later in the 20th century, however, magazine advertisements, student publications, business books, technical publications, scholarly journals, and business catalogues often included the statement with attribution to Ruskin.

In the 21st century, and based upon the statement&#x27;s applicability of the issues of quality and price, the statement continues to be used and attributed to Ruskin—despite the questionable nature of the attribution. 

For many years, various Baskin-Robbins ice cream parlours prominently displayed a section of the statement in framed signs: &quot;There is hardly anything in the world that someone cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper, and the people who consider price alone are that man&#x27;s lawful prey.&quot; The signs listed Ruskin as the author of the statement, but the signs gave no information on where or when Ruskin was supposed to have written, spoken, or published the statement. Due to the statement&#x27;s widespread use as a promotional slogan, and despite questions of Ruskin&#x27;s authorship, it is likely that many people who are otherwise unfamiliar with Ruskin now associate him with this statement.

==Definitions==

The OED credits Ruskin with the first quotation in 152 separate entries. Some include:
* Pathetic fallacy: Ruskin coined this term in &quot;Modern Painters&quot; III (1856) to describe the ascription of human emotions to inanimate objects and impersonal natural forces, as in &quot;Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy&quot; (Charlotte Brontë, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;).
* Fors Clavigera: Ruskin gave this title to a series of letters he wrote &quot;to the workmen and labourers of Great Britain&quot; (1871–84). The name was intended to signify three great powers that fashion human destiny, as Ruskin explained at length in Letter 2 (February 1871). These were: &quot;force&quot;, symbolised by the club (&quot;clava&quot;) of Hercules; &quot;For&quot;titude, symbolised by the key (&quot;clavis&quot;) of Ulysses; and &quot;For&quot;tune, symbolised by the nail (&quot;clavus&quot;) of Lycurgus. These three powers (the &quot;fors&quot;) together represent human talents and abilities to choose the right moment and then to strike with energy. The concept is derived from Shakespeare&#x27;s phrase &quot;There is a tide in the affairs of men/ Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune&quot; (Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;). Ruskin believed that the letters were inspired by the Third Fors: striking out at the right moment.
* Illth: Used by Ruskin as the antithesis of wealth, which he defined as life itself; broadly, where wealth is &#x27;well-being&#x27;, illth is &quot;ill-being&quot;.
* Theoria: Ruskin&#x27;s &#x27;theoretic&#x27; faculty – theoretic, as opposed to aesthetic – enables a vision of the beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, at least in terms of the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world. For an example of the influence of Ruskin&#x27;s concept of theoria, see Peter Fuller.
* Modern Atheism: Ruskin applied this label to &quot;the unfortunate persistence of the clerks in teaching children what they cannot understand and employing young consecrated persons to assert in pulpits what they do not know.&quot;
* Excrescence: Ruskin defined an &quot;excrescence&quot; as an outgrowth of the main body of a building that does not harmonise well with the main body. He originally used the term to describe certain Gothic Revival features also for later additions to cathedrals and various other public buildings, especially from the Gothic period.

<doc id="76641" wikidata="Q1212587" url="?curid=76641" title="Woman of the Year">
<text>Woman of the Year is a 1942 American romantic comedy drama film directed by George Stevens and starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The film was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin (with uncredited work on the rewritten ending by John Lee Mahin), and produced by Joseph L. Mankiewicz.

The film&#x27;s plot is about the relationship between Tess Harding—an international affairs correspondent, chosen &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;—and Sam Craig—a sportswriter—who meet, marry, and encounter problems as a result of her unflinching commitment to her work.

In 1999, this film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

Tess Harding and Sam Craig are journalists for the (fictional) &quot;New York Chronicle&quot;. Tess, the daughter of a former ambassador, is a highly educated, well-travelled political affairs columnist who speaks several languages fluently. Sam is a knowledgeable and well-informed sports writer. Their difficulties are presented as stemming from differences of class, experience and temperament, as well as from gender.

After Tess suggests on the radio that baseball be abolished for the duration of the war, Sam leaps to the sport&#x27;s defense. Their editor summons them to his office: he will not stand for an intramural feud at his paper. Sam invites Tess to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium. She is unfamiliar with the rules of the sport; Sam has some difficulty explaining them. Tess invites Sam to her apartment later that night. What he thought would be a date is actually a cocktail party where the guests are discussing the world situation in foreign languages. He leaves. She sends him champagne to apologize and asks him to take her to the airport so he can kiss her goodbye. On the drive back to town, Sam hits it off with Ellen Whitcomb, Tess&#x27;s aunt, who is a world-famous feminist. She advises him to &quot;marry the girl&quot;.

Sam has his mind on a personable wedding, but it quickly escalates into a production. A justice of the peace in South Carolina is arranged by Gerald, Tess&#x27;s ultra-competent secretary, to fit her schedule and that of her illustrious senator father. Their wedding night is disrupted by the arrival of a Yugoslavian statesman who has just escaped from the Nazis, and a stream of European disciples.

Conflicts large and small arise over Tess&#x27;s priorities and Sam&#x27;s place in her life, beginning with her decision to have Sam move into her apartment instead of them choosing a place together. Her business continually comes before her personal life, with Sam largely reduced to the role of an aide. Sensing her husband is unhappy, Tess floats the idea of having a child, which Sam is warm to until Tess reveals that she has already agreed to adopt a young Greek refugee named Chris, who speaks no English. Sam is very upset, but hides his anger from the child. Before the couple can discuss the issue, they are interrupted by the news that Tess has been named &quot;America&#x27;s Outstanding Woman of the Year&quot;.

Tess plans to leave Chris by himself while they go to the award gala, while Sam, already not keen on the gala, states his refusal to leave the boy alone. While Tess is at her gala, Sam returns the child to the orphanage; Chris is thrilled to see his friends again. Tess returns home with a following of photographers and discovers that Sam and Chris are gone. She attempts to reclaim Chris, but he refuses, preferring to stay with his friends. The next day, Tess receives a telegram from her aunt, telling the couple to come to her home in Connecticut. Sam declines to join, and opines that their marriage has neither been &quot;perfect or a marriage&quot;. Tess comes home to learn that her aunt and father are finally to be married that night. The ceremony has all the reverence and grace that was lacking in the Craigs&#x27; wedding; Tess is moved to tears. She drives through the night and arrives at Sam&#x27;s new Riverside apartment.

Allowed in by a super, Tess decides to prepare Sam breakfast while he sleeps in. She is inept in the kitchen and Sam is awakened by the clatter. Tess confesses to Sam of her recent wedding experience, and proclaims her newfound inspiration to serve only as his wife. Sam asks Tess to walk back her overbearing dedication, and to assume the role of &quot;Tess Harding Craig&quot; rather than just &quot;Tess Harding&quot; or &quot;Mrs. Sam Craig&quot;. She agrees. Gerald appears with a champagne bottle, announcing that Tess is expected to launch a battleship. Sam takes Gerald outside and returns with the broken bottle, announcing that he has just &quot;launched Gerald&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Writing===
The outline for the film was developed by Garson Kanin, a close friend of Hepburn&#x27;s. The character of Tess Harding was based on Dorothy Thompson, an American journalist and radio broadcaster who was highly influential. Hepburn then passed the outline to Joseph L. Mankiewicz at MGM, and said the price was $250,000 – half for her, half for the script. He liked it and agreed to produce the movie. Kanin was fighting in the war at the time, so the script was written by his brother, Michael Kanin, and mutual friend Ring Lardner Jr. Hepburn contributed significantly to the script – reading it, suggesting cuts and word changes, and generally providing helpful enthusiasm for the project. As a part of the deal, Hepburn had the option of selecting her co-star and director (Tracy and Stevens).

===Casting===
&quot;Woman of the Year&quot; was the first of nine films Hepburn and Tracy made together. They met for the first time on the shoot. In the 1993 documentary &quot;Katharine Hepburn: All About Me&quot;, Hepburn herself says she was wearing high heels at the first meeting with Tracy and producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and said &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m a bit tall for you, Mr. Tracy&quot;. Mankiewicz then responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, Kate, he&#x27;ll cut you down to size.&quot; It was during the filming of &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; that Hepburn and Tracy became romantically involved – a relationship that lasted until Tracy&#x27;s death in 1967.

===Reshoots===
The film was originally shot with a different ending, but it proved unpopular at test screenings. The decision was made to change it, and the final fifteen minutes of the film were re-written and shot. In the original ending, Sam went missing after returning the child to the orphanage, while he was supposed to write an article about an upcoming boxing match. Tess decides to take over for him and visits the gym to learn about the fight. Sam, who is in a language school trying to learn French and Spanish to &quot;be important&quot;, is shocked when he sees the article. He goes to the fight, where he encounters Tess. She insists that she did the work to be a &quot;good wife,&quot; and states her dedication to Sam. He says that he does not want either extreme; he just wants her to be &quot;Tess Harding Craig&quot; (as in the released ending).

Ring Lardner Jr. describes in Archive of America Television oral history interviews (2000) that changes made to the ending of the film were against the wishes of Katharine Hepburn, and were implemented while both screenwriters were on vacation in New York. The changes were instigated by Louis B. Mayer, producer Joseph L. Mankiewicz and director George Stevens, with the actual new ending being written by John Lee Mahin (who was uncredited). In an interview, Lardner indicated that these parties all believed that Tess Harding &quot;had to get her comeuppance for being too strong in a man&#x27;s world, so they wrote a scene where she tried to fix breakfast ... and gets everything wrong.&quot; Lardner and Kanin were given some room to rewrite the new ending on returning from New York, and in the same interview Lardner recalls &quot;some of the worst lines we rewrote, but we couldn&#x27;t fix it, we couldn&#x27;t change it fundamentally&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Woman of the Year&quot; holds a rating of 83% from 30 reviews. The consensus states: &quot;In the first romantic comedy pairing of Tracy and Hepburn, the stars&#x27; chemistry is off to a working start and the film&#x27;s sparkling comedy smooths out any rough patches.&quot;

===Box office===
The film earned $1,935,000 in the United States and Canada and $773,000 elsewhere during its initial release, making MGM a profit of $753,000.

==Awards and honors==
At the 15th Academy Awards, Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner Jr. won the award for Best Original Screenplay, and Katharine Hepburn was nominated for Best Actress.

American Film Institute included the film in the 2000 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs (#90) and in 2002, in AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions (#74).

A 1976 remake of the film, made for television and starring Joseph Bologna and Renée Taylor, was broadcast on CBS.

In 1981, the film was adapted into a successful Broadway musical of the same name, starring Lauren Bacall, who won a Tony Award for her work.

<text>A Woman Under the Influence is a 1974 American drama film written and directed by John Cassavetes, and starring his wife Gena Rowlands and close friend Peter Falk. Rowlands plays a housewife whose unusual behavior leads to conflict with her blue-collar husband (Falk) and family.

The film, Cassavetes&#x27; seventh as director, premiered at the 1974 New York Film Festival, before going into wide theatrical release on November 18, 1974. It received two Academy Award nominations: for Best Director and Best Actress (for Rowlands). Rowlands won a Golden Globe Award and National Board of Review Award for her performance.

In 1990, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

== Plot ==
Although she is hesitant to do so, Mabel Longhetti, a Los Angeles housewife and mother who exhibits strange behavior, sends her three young children—Tony, Angelo, and Maria—to spend the night with her mother so she and her husband, Nick, can have a date night. Unfortunately, Nick, who is the foreman of a utility crew, has to cancel to fix a burst water main. Alone and drunk, Mabel goes to a bar and behaves very familiarly to a stranger named Garson Cross, who takes her home. She is almost unconscious by the time they get there, and Garson forces himself on her while she feebly attempts to fight him off.
The next morning, a confused Mabel briefly argues with Garson—whom she confuses by calling him &quot;Nick&quot;—before he leaves. Nick brings his 11-member crew to the house for breakfast after their long night, and Mabel makes everyone spaghetti. She is very polite to Nick&#x27;s colleagues, but she asks several of them for their names, even though they have met before. The meal is superficially pleasant, until Nick snaps at Mabel for making one of his men feel uncomfortable by being overly warm to him, and the men use a phone call from Nick&#x27;s mother as an excuse to make a hurried exit.

Mabel hosts a play date, but the father of the other children, Harold Jensen, is disturbed by her behavior and reluctant to leave his children alone with her. Nick comes home with his mother, Margaret, to find all of the children half-naked and running wild, with Jensen trying to get his children dressed. He slaps Mabel and gets into a fistfight with an angry Jensen, but Margaret breaks them up, and Jensen leaves with his children.

At his wits&#x27; end, Nick calls Mabel&#x27;s doctor, Dr. Zepp, to evaluate her mental health. Mabel gets worked up, particularly by the presence of her mother-in-law, who calls Mabel a bad wife and an unfit mother when Nick is trying to calm her down. She becomes increasingly detached from reality, and violently resists when Dr. Zepp tries give to her a sedative injection. Convinced she has become a threat to herself and others, Dr. Zepp has Mabel involuntarily committed.

At work, Nick is on edge and yells at his coworkers when they ask about what happened with Mabel. Eddie, Nick&#x27;s closest friend, remains quiet, but even this rubs Nick the wrong way. He yells at Eddie while Eddie is rappelling down a steep incline, and Eddie falls and gets injured. Afterward, Nick picks up his children from school early to go to the beach and allows them to sip his beer.

Six months later, Nick plans a large surprise welcome home party to celebrate Mabel&#x27;s return from the hospital. However, his mother points out that this may be overwhelming for her, and Nick has her ask all of the guests who are not family to leave. When Mabel arrives, she is quiet and apprehensive, and no one else knows what to say, either. Nick tries his best to make Mabel feel comfortable, but, when she begins to joke around, he blows up and says they are going to have a normal conversation. Mabel says she does not know how to act without the routine provided by the hospital, which included therapies and medications and shock treatments, and she asks everyone to leave. While the guests get their coats, Mabel begins to dance on the couch while humming the theme from &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.

When Nick approaches Mabel, she runs into the bathroom and cuts her hand with a razor. He stops her, and she runs to the living room and climbs back up on the couch. The children, confused and concerned, try to protect Mabel by pushing Nick away from her. Nick slaps Mabel, knocking her to the ground, and then tries to put the children to bed, but they escape and go back to Mabel. Seeming somewhat recovered, Mabel, still bleeding, takes the children upstairs and tucks them in while they express their love for her. She and Nick go back downstairs, where he tends to her hand and they clean up and get ready for bed.

== Cast ==
From the American Film Institute:
== Production ==
John Cassavetes was inspired to write &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; when his wife Gena Rowlands expressed a desire to appear in a play about the difficulties faced by contemporary women. His completed script was so intense and emotional that she knew she would be unable to perform it eight times a week, so he decided to adapt it for the screen.

When he tried to raise funding for the film, Cassavetes was told that &quot;No one wants to see a crazy, middle-aged dame.&quot; Lacking studio financing, he mortgaged his house and borrowed money from family and friends, one of whom was Peter Falk, who liked the screenplay so much that he invested $500,000 in the project.

The crew consisted of professionals and students from the American Film Institute, where Cassavetes was serving as the first &quot;filmmaker in residence&quot; at their Center for Advanced Film Studies. Working with a limited budget forced him to shoot scenes in a real house near Hollywood Boulevard, and Rowlands was responsible for her own hairstyling and makeup.

== Release ==
Upon completion of the film, Cassavetes was unable to find a distributor, so he personally called theater owners and asked them to show it. He got it booked at art houses and shown on college campuses, where he and Falk would discuss it with the audience. According Jeff Lipsky, a college student who was hired to help distribute the film: &quot;It was the first time in the history of motion pictures that an independent film was distributed without the use of a nationwide system of sub-distributors.&quot;

The film was screened at the San Sebastián Film Festival, where Rowlands was named Best Actress and Cassavetes won the Silver Shell Award for Best Director, and the New York Film Festival, where it captured the attention of such film critics as Rex Reed. When Richard Dreyfuss appeared on &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot; with Peter Falk, he described &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; as &quot;the most incredible, disturbing, scary, brilliant, dark, sad, depressing movie&quot;, and added that he &quot;went crazy. I went home and vomited&quot;, which prompted curious audiences to seek out the film capable of making Dreyfuss (who is himself bipolar) ill.

=== Home media ===
In 1992, Touchstone Home Video released the film on VHS.

On September 21, 2004, The Criterion Collection released the film—together with &quot;Shadows&quot; (1959), &quot;Faces&quot; (1968), &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; (1976), and &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977)—in Region 1 as part of the eight-disc DVD box set &quot;John Cassavetes: Five Films&quot;. Bonus features for the film include an audio commentary by composer and sound recordist Bo Harwood and camera operator Mike Ferris, a video conversation between Rowlands and Falk, an essay by film critic Kent Jones, and audio and written interviews with Cassavetes from 1975. On October 22, 2013, the box set was re-released on Blu-ray.

== Reception and legacy ==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 86% of 36 critics&#x27; reviews of the film are positive, with an average rating of 8.2/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;Electrified by searing performances from Gena Rowlands and Peter Falk, &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; finds pioneering independent filmmaker John Cassavetes working at his artistic peak.&quot;

Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed: &quot;Miss Rowlands unleashes an extraordinary characterization. [...] The actress’s style of performing sometimes shows a kinship with that of the early Kim Stanley or the recent Joanne Woodward, but the notes of desperation are emphatically her own. [...] Peter Falk gives a rousing performance [...] and the children are very well directed. But the movie didn&#x27;t need to be 2 hours and 35 minutes long: there&#x27;s too much small talk, which doesn&#x27;t really reveal character. Still, the most frightening scenes are extremely compelling, and this is a thoughtful film that does prompt serious discussion.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, calling it &quot;terribly complicated, involved and fascinating – a revelation&quot;, and saying: &quot;The characters are larger than life (although not less convincing because of that), and their loves and rages, their fights and moments of tenderness, exist at exhausting levels of emotion. [...] Cassavetes is strongest as a writer and filmmaker at creating specific characters and then sticking with them through long, painful, uncompromising scenes until we know them well enough to read them, to predict what they&#x27;ll do next and even to begin to understand why.&quot; He later added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list, in which he called it &quot;perhaps the greatest of Cassavetes&#x27; films.&quot;

&quot;Time Out London&quot; wrote: &quot;The brilliance of the film lies in its sympathetic and humorous exposure of social structure. Rowlands unfortunately overdoes the manic psychosis at times, and lapses into a melodramatic style which is unconvincing and unsympathetic; but Falk is persuasively insane as the husband; and the result is an astonishing, compulsive film, directed with a crackling energy.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film four stars out of four, calling it &quot;tough-minded&quot;, &quot;moving&quot;, and &quot;an insightful essay on sexual politics.&quot;

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, however, condemned the film as a &quot;didactic illustration of (R.D.) Laing&#x27;s version of insanity.” Stanley Kauffmann of &quot;The New Republic&quot; also panned the film in his 1974 review, writing: &quot;To me this film is utterly without interest or merit&quot;. John Simon, noted for his frequently caustic and disparaging reviews, called the film &quot;dreadful.&quot;

In &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;″s 2012 poll of the greatest films of all time, the film placed 59th in the directors&#x27; poll and 144th in the critics&#x27; poll. In 2015, the BBC named &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; the 31st greatest American film ever made.

In 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, one of the first fifty films to be so honored.

=== Accolades ===
== Restoration and preservation ==
The world premiere screening of a restored print of the film was held at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco on April 26, 2009, as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival. Gena Rowlands attended the premiere and spoke briefly. The restoration was performed by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, with funding provided by Gucci and The Film Foundation.

<text>Clarabelle Cow is a cartoon character created by The Walt Disney Company. As an anthropomorphic cow, Clarabelle is one of Minnie Mouse&#x27;s best friends. She was once depicted as the girlfriend of Horace Horsecollar, although now she is often paired with Goofy.

==Appearances==

===Animation===
Clarabelle first appeared as a nonhumanized cow in the Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;Plane Crazy&quot; in 1928. Humanized soon afterward, she appeared frequently in cartoons from 1930 to 1932 and less frequently afterwards, taking her final classic-era bow in 1942. As with most Disney characters, she was later given small cameos in the featurettes &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; (1990) and the 1988 feature film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;.

Clarabelle mostly played bit-parts in the 30+ films in which she appeared and her character was never as fully developed as Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald Duck or Pluto. She and Horace Horsecollar changed from normal farmyard animals into anthropomorphized beings as necessary.

In modern animation, Clarabelle has returned to active use, appearing first in a few segments of &quot;Mickey Mouse Works&quot; and in a brief scene in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmas&quot;. In &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, she regularly turned up as a gossip columnist with the tagline &quot;Gossip is Always True&quot;.

Clarabelle has also made appearances in the preschool series &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; and is featured as Goofy&#x27;s girlfriend (in which she owns a puppy named Bella) and in the direct-to-video movie &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot; as Pete&#x27;s lieutenant and Goofy&#x27;s love interest. She also appears in &quot;Mickey and the Roadster Racers&quot;, where she displays attraction towards both Goofy and Horace.

===Comics===
When the Disney characters started to feature in comic strips and comic books, Clarabelle Cow was one of the first. Her first appearance was in the &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; comic strip for April 2, 1930. Along with Horace Horsecollar, Clara Cluck, Goofy, Minnie, and Mickey, she appeared in comics on a regular basis in the fifties, sixties and seventies.

For a brief time, during the late 1960s, Clarabelle began dating Goofy. During this time, Horace&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown. Clarabelle&#x27;s status with Goofy was challenged by a rival named Glory-Bee. In later comics, Clarabelle and Horace were a couple again. Clarabelle also has a young cousin, Bertie the Jinx, a niece, Itsy-Betsy, and a socialite aunt named Miss Bovina, who have appeared in several issues of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;.

From the eighties forward, only a few stories with Clarabelle Cow were made in the United States. In Europe, especially in Italy, the production of stories continued to the present day. In Italian comics, Clarabelle (called &quot;Clarabella&quot;) is very popular and she is the girlfriend of Horace Horsecollar (&quot;Orazio Cavezza&quot;).

===Disney theme parks===

From September 2006 to September 2008, Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar appeared together for meet-and-greets in Town Square at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World. Also, they were in the Main Street Family Fun Day Parade. Clarabelle appears seasonally in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Boo-to-You Halloween Parade&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Once Upon a Christmastime Parade&quot;, and the &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Most Merriest Celebration&quot; castle show. She and Horace both appear in the Hoedown Happening in Frontierland and as featured characters in the &quot;Move It! Shake It! Mousekedance It!&quot; street party, with Clarabelle in particular atop her own party box and with her own dialogue.

Clarabelle also appears (without Horace) at Disneyland Park. She has also appeared in several Disneyland parades and shows over the years, including The World According to Goofy, Light Magic, the Parade of the Stars, Fantasmic, A Christmas Fantasy Parade and Celebrate! A Street Party. Clarabelle and Horace come out for meet-and-greets and appear in parades and shows on a regular basis at Tokyo Disneyland as well. In 2009, Clarabelle played a leading character in the New Year&#x27;s Greeting at Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea.

Clarabelle Cow was chosen to meet and greet for Character Fan Days at Disneyland. She is accompanied by Horace Horsecollar which is his first meet and greet at Disneyland in Anaheim.

At Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort, in the Buena Vista Street area there is an ice cream shop named &quot;Clarabelle&#x27;s Hand-Scooped Ice Cream&quot;.

She also features with Horace in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Halloween Celebration&quot; and &quot;Goofy&#x27;s Garden Party&quot; in Disneyland Paris. In Christmas 2016, Clarabelle returned to Magic Kingdom for &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Most Merriest Celebration&quot;.

===Video games===
Clarabelle appeared as the DJ of the song &quot;Miwaku No Tango&quot; in the 2000 Japanese Nintendo 64 game &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Disney Dancing Museum&quot;.

Clarabelle appears in &quot;Disney&#x27;s Toontown Online&quot;. She plays the role of giving the player furniture to decorate their estates, with the catalog players must order from is a &quot;Cattlelog&quot;. Her appearance is also somewhat changed to look like an operator.

She also makes a minor appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; in the Timeless River World using her old black and white design. She appears with the same design in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; in the minigame &quot;The Karnival Kid&quot;.

Clarabelle is also seen in the &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; video games, as one of the forgotten characters that Mickey sees during his journey. She lives in OsTown, one of the games environs, and is known to be romantically involved with Horace Horsecollar.

<doc id="76647" wikidata="Q1321622" url="?curid=76647" title="Yankee Doodle Dandy">
<text>Yankee Doodle Dandy is a 1942 American biographical musical drama film about George M. Cohan, known as &quot;The Man Who Owned Broadway&quot;. It stars James Cagney, Joan Leslie, Walter Huston, and Richard Whorf, and features Irene Manning, George Tobias, Rosemary DeCamp, Jeanne Cagney, and Vera Lewis. Joan Leslie&#x27;s singing voice was partially dubbed by Sally Sweetland.

The film was written by Robert Buckner and Edmund Joseph, and directed by Michael Curtiz. According to the special edition DVD, significant and uncredited improvements were made to the script by the twin brothers Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein. The film was a major hit for Warner Brothers, and was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning three.

In 1993, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, and in 1998, the film was included on the American Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;100 Years...100 Movies&quot; list, a compilation of the 100 greatest films in American cinema.

==Plot==
In the early days of World War II, George M. Cohan comes out of retirement to star as President Roosevelt in the Rodgers and Hart musical &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Right.&quot; On the show&#x27;s first night, he is summoned to the White House to meet the President, who presents him with a Congressional Gold Medal (although the Cohan character on screen incorrectly identifies the award as the Congressional Medal of Honor). Cohan is overcome and chats with Roosevelt, recalling his early days on the stage.

The film flashes back to Cohan&#x27;s supposed July 4 birth while his father is performing on the vaudeville stage.

Cohan and his sister join the family act as soon as they learn to dance, and soon The Four Cohans are performing successfully. But George gets cocky as he grows up and is blacklisted by theatrical producers for being troublesome. He leaves the act and hawks his songs unsuccessfully to producers.

In partnership with Sam Harris, another struggling writer, Cohan finally interests a producer and they are on the road to success. He marries Mary, a young singer/dancer. As his star ascends, he persuades his now-struggling parents to join his act, eventually vesting some of his valuable theatrical properties in their name. Cohan retires but returns to the stage several times, culminating in the role of the U.S. President.

The film returns to the White House, where George has just received the Congressional Gold Medal. As Cohan leaves, he tap-dances down a set of stairs (which Cagney thought up before the scene was filmed and undertook without rehearsal). Outside, Cohan joins a military parade where the soldiers are singing &quot;Over There&quot;; at first, he isn&#x27;t singing. Not knowing Cohan is the song&#x27;s composer, one of the soldiers asks if he knows the words. Cohan responds &quot;I believe I do&quot; with a smile before joining in.

Cast notes:
*In his role as adviser to the film, George M. Cohan, who admired Fred Astaire&#x27;s work, let it be known that he preferred Astaire, who also bore a passing resemblance to him, to star in his life story. Cohan presented several studios one of which had Fred Astaire playing Cohan, but Astaire repeatedly turned it down. Astaire turned it down because Cohan&#x27;s eccentric, stiff-legged dancing was far removed from Astaire&#x27;s own, more fluid, style.
*James Cagney reprised the role of George M. Cohan in &quot;The Seven Little Foys&quot; (1955) on the condition that he receive no money; he did the film as a tribute to Eddie Foy. In &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, Eddie Foy Jr. played his own father. In &quot;The Seven Little Foys&quot;, Bob Hope portrayed Foy; Charley Foy (brother of Eddie Foy, Jr.) served as a narrator.
*Actress Jeanne Cagney, who played Cohan&#x27;s sister, was James Cagney&#x27;s real-life sister. Cagney&#x27;s brother, William Cagney, was the Associate Producer of the film.
*Rosemary DeCamp, who played George&#x27;s mother, was 11 years younger than Cagney.
*President Franklin D. Roosevelt was played by Captain Jack Young, a lookalike seen only from the back. An uncredited impressionist, Art Gilmore, provided the voice of Roosevelt. Gilmore would narrate the Joe McDoakes film shorts produced by Warners, and became a well-known announcer on television through the 1970s.

==Background and production==
Cagney, like Cohan, was an Irish-American who had been a song-and-dance man early in his career. His unique and seemingly odd presentation style, of half-singing and half-reciting the songs, reflected the style that Cohan himself used. His natural dance style and physique were also a good match for Cohan. Newspapers at the time reported that Cagney intended to consciously imitate Cohan&#x27;s song-and-dance style, but to play the normal part of the acting in his own style. Although director Curtiz was known as a taskmaster, he also gave his actors some latitude. Cagney and other players came up with a number of &quot;bits of business&quot;, as Cagney called them, meaning improvised lines or action in theater parlance.

A number of the biographical particulars of the movie are Hollywood-ized fiction, such as omitting the fact that Cohan divorced and remarried. Cohan&#x27;s two wives, Ethel and Agnes, were combined into a single character named Mary (in the film, Cohan wrote &quot;Mary&#x27;s A Grand Old Name&quot; about her). It also took some liberties with the chronology of Cohan&#x27;s life and the order of his parents&#x27; deaths.

In one scene, after Cohan suffers a flop with an atypical non-musical drama, &quot;Popularity&quot;, he writes a telegram apologizing to the public. He then leaves the Western Union office to find newspaper sellers announcing the torpedoing of the &quot;Lusitania&quot;. In reality, the failed play was staged in 1906 and the &quot;Lusitania&quot;″s sinking occurred in 1915.

Nevertheless, care was taken to make the sets, costumes, and dance steps match the original stage presentations. Cagney sprained an ankle twice while mastering Cohan&#x27;s stiff-legged dance style. This effort was aided significantly by Jack Boyle, a former associate of Cohan&#x27;s who knew the original productions well. Boyle was also in some of the dancing groups featured in the movie.

Cagney, as Cohan, is shown performing as a singing and dancing version of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Although it was well known, Roosevelt&#x27;s use of a wheelchair after a paralytic illness was not emphasized at the time. In the film, Roosevelt never leaves his chair when meeting Cohan.

Cohan himself served as a consultant during the production of the film, as well as being credited with the incidental score. Due to his failing health, his actual involvement in the film was limited. But when completed, the film was privately screened for Cohan and he commented on Cagney&#x27;s performance: &quot;My God, what an act to follow!&quot;

Because of Cohan&#x27;s health, Warner Brothers moved the scheduled gala premiere from July 4 to May 29. The original date was chosen because of the film&#x27;s patriotic theme and because in the movie, Cohan is said to have been born on the Fourth of July (as he wrote in the lyrics of &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;). However, Cohan was actually born July 3. Cohan lived for several months after the film&#x27;s release.

The movie poster for this film was the first ever produced by noted poster designer Bill Gold.

==Production==
Cagney had initially been opposed to a biopic of Cohan&#x27;s life, having disliked Cohan since the Actors&#x27; Equity Strike in 1919 in which he sided with the producers. In 1940, Cagney and 15 other Hollywood figures were named in the grand jury testimony of John R. Leech, self-described &quot;chief functionary&quot; of the Los Angeles Communist Party who had been subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities. &quot;The New York Times&quot; printed a front-page allegation that Cagney was a communist. Cagney refuted the accusation and Martin Dies, Jr. made a statement to the press clearing Cagney. William Cagney, one of the film&#x27;s producers, reportedly told his brother &quot;We&#x27;re going to have to make the goddamndest patriotic picture that&#x27;s ever been made. I think it&#x27;s the Cohan story&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film nearly doubled the earnings of &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot; (1942), Cagney&#x27;s previous effort, bringing in more than $6 million in rentals to Warner Brothers. According to Warner Brothers records, it earned $4,631,000 domestically and $1,892,000 foreign. This made it the biggest box-office success in the company&#x27;s history up to that time. The star earned his contractual $150,000 salary and nearly half a million dollars in profit sharing. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film earned $4.8 million in theatrical rentals through its North American release.

===Critical response===
Contemporary reviews were highly positive. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said film patrons would do well to see it, for &quot;you will find as warm and delightful a musical picture as has hit the screen in years, a corking good entertainment and as affectionate, if not as accurate, a film biography as has ever—yes, ever—been made ... there is so much in this picture and so many persons that deserve their meed of praise that every one connected with it can stick a feather in his hat and take our word—it&#x27;s dandy!&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;as entertaining as any top filmusical ever made ... James Cagney does a Cohan of which the original George M. might well be proud.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; wrote: &quot;Excellent! Audiences should find this musical comedy, which is based on the life of George M. Cohan, one of the most sparkling and delightful musical pictures that have ever been brought to the screen. Much of its entertainment value is due to the exceptionally fine performance of James Cagney, whose impersonation of Mr. Cohan is uncanny—his gestures, his talk, and his dancing, are done to perfection.&quot; John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;a complete delight, an extravaganza of tunes the country has liked for decades,&quot; although he considered it &quot;dubious&quot; as a biography of Cohan.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 90% of 29 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;James Cagney deploys his musical gifts to galvanizing effect in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, a celebration of patriotic fervor as much as it is a biopic of George M. Cohan.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 89 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Awards and honors===
The film won Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role (James Cagney), Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture (Ray Heindorf and Heinz Roemheld), and Best Sound Recording (Nathan Levinson). It was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Walter Huston), Best Director, Best Film Editing for George Amy, Best Picture and Best Writing, Original Story. In 1993, &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Naval architecture, or naval engineering, is an engineering discipline incorporating elements of mechanical, electrical, electronic, software and safety engineering as applied to the engineering design process, shipbuilding, maintenance, and operation of marine vessels and structures. Naval architecture involves basic and applied research, design, development, design evaluation (classification) and calculations during all stages of the life of a marine vehicle. Preliminary design of the vessel, its detailed design, construction, trials, operation and maintenance, launching and dry-docking are the main activities involved. Ship design calculations are also required for ships being modified (by means of conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or repair). Naval architecture also involves formulation of safety regulations and damage-control rules and the approval and certification of ship designs to meet statutory and non-statutory requirements.

==Main subjects==
The word &quot;vessel&quot; includes every description of watercraft, mainly ships and boats, but also including non-displacement craft, WIG craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water. The principal elements of naval architecture are detailed in the following sections.

===Hydrostatics===

Hydrostatics concerns the conditions to which the vessel is subjected while at rest in water and to its ability to remain afloat. This involves computing buoyancy, displacement, and other hydrostatic properties such as trim (the measure of the longitudinal inclination of the vessel) and stability (the ability of a vessel to restore itself to an upright position after being inclined by wind, sea, or loading conditions).

===Hydrodynamics===
* Hydrodynamics concerns the flow of water around the ship&#x27;s hull, bow, and stern, and over bodies such as propeller blades or rudder, or through thruster tunnels. 
*Ship resistance and propulsion concern resistance towards motion in water primarily caused due to flow of water around the hull. Powering calculation is done based on this.
* Propulsion is used to move the vessel through water using propellers, thrusters, water jets, sails etc. Engine types are mainly internal combustion. Some vessels are electrically powered using nuclear or solar energy.
* Ship motions involves motions of the vessel in seaway and its responses in waves and wind.
* Controllability (maneuvering) involves controlling and maintaining position and direction of the vessel.

=== Flotation and stability ===

While atop a liquid surface a floating body has 6 degrees of freedom in its movements, these are categorized in either translation or rotation.

* Translation
** Sway: transverse
** Surge: fore and aft
** Heave: vertical
* Rotation
** Yaw: about a vertical axis
** Pitch or trim: about a transverse axis
** Roll or heel: about a fore and aft axis

Longitudinal stability for longitudinal inclinations, the stability depends upon the distance between the center of gravity and the longitudinal meta-center. In other words, the basis in which the ship maintains its center of gravity is its distance set equally apart from both the aft and forward section of the ship.

While a body floats on a liquid surface it still encounters the force of gravity pushing down on it. In order to stay afloat and avoid sinking there is an opposed force acting against the body known as the hydrostatic pressures. The forces acting on the body must be of the same magnitude and same line of motion in order to maintain the body at equilibrium. This description of equilibrium is only present when a freely floating body is in still water, when other conditions are present the magnitude of which these forces shifts drastically creating the swaying motion of the body.

The buoyancy force is equal to the weight of the body, in other words, the mass of the body is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the body. This adds an upward force to the body by the amount of surface area times the area displaced in order to create an equilibrium between the surface of the body and the surface of the water.

The stability of a ship under most conditions is able to overcome any form or restriction or resistance encountered in rough seas; however, ships have undesirable roll characteristics when the balance of oscillations in roll is two times that of oscillations in heave, thus causing the ship to capsize.

===Structures===

Structures involves selection of material of construction, structural analysis of global and local strength of the vessel, vibration of the structural components and structural responses of the vessel during motions in seaway. Depending on type of ship, the structure and design will vary in what material to use as well as how much of it. Some ships are made from glass reinforced plastics but the vast majority are steel with possibly some aluminium in the superstructure.

The complete structure of the ship is designed with panels shaped in a rectangular form consisting of steel plating supported on four edges. Combined in a large surface area the Grillages create the hull of the ship, deck, and bulkheads while still providing mutual support of the frames. Though the structure of the ship is sturdy enough to hold itself together the main force it has to overcome is longitudinal bending creating a strain against its hull, its structure must be designed so that the material is disposed as much forward and aft as possible.

The principal longitudinal elements are the deck, shell plating, inner bottom all of which are in the form of grillages, and additional longitudinal stretching to these. The dimensions of the ship are in order to create enough spacing between the stiffeners in prevention of buckling. Warships have used a longitudinal system of stiffening that many modern commercial vessels have adopted. This system was widely used in early merchant ships such as the SS Great Eastern, but later shifted to transversely framed structure another concept in ship hull design that proved more practical. This system was later implemented on modern vessels such as tankers because of its popularity and was then named the Isherwood System.

The arrangement of the Isherwood system consists of stiffening decks both side and bottom by longitudinal members, they are separated enough so they have the same distance between them as the frames and beams. This system works by spacing out the transverse members that support the longitudinal by about 3 or 4 meters, with the wide spacing this causes the traverse strength needed by displacing the amount of force the bulkheads provide.

===Arrangements===

Arrangements involves concept design, layout and access, fire protection, allocation of spaces, ergonomics and capacity.

===Construction===

Construction depends on the material used. When steel or aluminium is used this involves welding of the plates and profiles after rolling, marking, cutting and bending as per the structural design drawings or models, followed by erection and launching. Other joining techniques are used for other materials like fibre reinforced plastic and glass-reinforced plastic. The process of construction is thought-out cautiously while considering all factors like safety, strength of structure, hydrodynamics, and ship arrangement. Each factor considered presents a new option for materials to consider as well as ship orientation. When the strength of the structure is considered the acts of ship collision are considered in the way that the ships structure is altered. Therefore, the properties of materials are considered carefully as applied material on the struck ship has elastic properties, the energy absorbed by the ship being struck is then deflected in the opposite direction, so both ships go through the process of rebounding to prevent further damage.

==Science and craft==

Traditionally, naval architecture has been more craft than science. The suitability of a vessel&#x27;s shape was judged by looking at a half-model of a vessel or a prototype. Ungainly shapes or abrupt transitions were frowned on as being flawed. This included rigging, deck arrangements, and even fixtures. Subjective descriptors such as &quot;ungainly&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, and &quot;fine&quot; were used as a substitute for the more precise terms used today. A vessel was, and still is described as having a ‘fair’ shape. The term ‘fair’ is meant to denote not only a smooth transition from fore to aft but also a shape that was ‘right.’ Determining what is ‘right’ in a particular situation in the absence of definitive supporting analysis encompasses the art of naval architecture to this day.

Modern low-cost digital computers and dedicated software, combined with extensive research to correlate full-scale, towing tank and computational data, have enabled naval architects to more accurately predict the performance of a marine vehicle. These tools are used for static stability (intact and damaged), dynamic stability, resistance, powering, hull development, structural analysis, green water modelling, and slamming analysis. Data are regularly shared in international conferences sponsored by RINA, Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME) and others. Computational Fluid Dynamics is being applied to predict the response of a floating body in a random sea.

==The naval architect==

Due to the complexity associated with operating in a marine environment, naval architecture is a co-operative effort between groups of technically skilled individuals who are specialists in particular fields, often coordinated by a lead naval architect. This inherent complexity also means that the analytical tools available are much less evolved than those for designing aircraft, cars and even spacecraft. This is due primarily to the paucity of data on the environment the marine vehicle is required to work in and the complexity of the interaction of waves and wind on a marine structure.

A naval architect is an engineer who is responsible for the design, classification, survey, construction, and/or repair of ships, boats, other marine vessels, and offshore structures, both commercial and military, including:

:* Merchant ships – oil tankers, gas tankers, cargo ships, bulk carriers, container ships
:* Passenger/vehicle ferries, cruise ships
:* Warships – frigates, destroyers, aircraft carriers, amphibious ships
:* Submarines and underwater vehicles
:* Icebreakers
:* High speed craft – hovercraft, multi-hull ships, hydrofoil craft
:* Workboats – barges, fishing boats, anchor handling tug supply vessels, platform supply vessels, tug boats, pilot vessels, rescue craft
:* Yachts, power boats, and other recreational watercraft
:* Offshore platforms and subsea developments

Some of these vessels are amongst the largest (such as supertankers), most complex (such as aircraft carriers), and highly valued movable structures produced by mankind. They are typically the most efficient method of transporting the world&#x27;s raw materials and products. Modern engineering on this scale is essentially a team activity conducted by specialists in their respective fields and disciplines. 
Naval architects integrate these activities. This demanding leadership role requires managerial qualities and the ability to bring together the often-conflicting demands of the various design constraints to produce a product which is fit for the purpose.

In addition to this leadership role, a naval architect also has a specialist function in ensuring that a safe, economic, environmentally sound and seaworthy design is produced. To undertake all these tasks, a naval architect must have an understanding of many branches of engineering and must be in the forefront of high technology areas. He or she must be able to effectively utilize the services provided by scientists, lawyers, accountants, and business people of many kinds.

Naval architects typically work for shipyards, ship owners, design firms and consultancies, equipment manufacturers, Classification societies, regulatory bodies (Admiralty law), navies, and governments. A small majority of Naval Architects also work in education, of which only 5 universities in the United States are accredited with Naval Architecture &amp; Marine Engineering programs. The United States Naval Academy is home to one of the most knowledgeable professors of Naval Architecture; CAPT. Michael Bito, USN.

<text>The Fenian Brotherhood () was an Irish republican organisation founded in the United States in 1858 by John O&#x27;Mahony and Michael Doheny. It was a precursor to Clan na Gael, a sister organisation to the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB). Members were commonly known as &quot;Fenians&quot;. O&#x27;Mahony, who was a Gaelic scholar, named his organisation after the Fianna, the legendary band of Irish warriors led by Fionn mac Cumhaill.

==Background==
The Fenian Brotherhood trace their origins back to 1790s, in the rebellion, seeking an end to British rule in Ireland initially for self-government and then the establishment of an Irish Republic. The rebellion was suppressed, but the principles of the United Irishmen were to have a powerful influence on the course of Irish history.

Following the collapse of the rebellion, the British Prime Minister William Pitt introduced a bill to abolish the Irish parliament and manufactured a Union between Ireland and Britain. Opposition from the Protestant oligarchy that controlled the parliament was countered by the widespread and open use of bribery. The Act of Union was passed and became law on 1 January 1801. The Catholics, who had been excluded from the Irish parliament, were promised emancipation under the Union. This promise was never kept and caused a protracted and bitter struggle for civil liberties. It was not until 1829 that the British government reluctantly conceded Catholic Emancipation. Though leading to general emancipation, this process simultaneously disenfranchised the small tenants, known as &#x27;forty shilling freeholders&#x27;, who were mainly Catholics.

Daniel O&#x27;Connell, who had led the emancipation campaign, then attempted the same methods in his campaign to have the Act of Union with Britain repealed. Despite the use of petitions and public meetings that attracted vast popular support, the government thought the Union was more important than Irish public opinion.

In the early 1840s, the younger members of the repeal movement became impatient with O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s over-cautious policies and began to question his intentions. Later they were what came to be known as the Young Ireland movement.

During the famine, the social class comprising small farmers and laborers was almost wiped out by starvation, disease and emigration. The Great Famine of the 1840s caused the deaths of 1 million Irish people and another million emigrated to escape it, with a further million over following decades. That the people starved while livestock and grain continued to be exported, quite often under military escort, would leave a legacy of bitterness and resentment among the survivors. The waves of emigration also ensured that such feelings would not be confined to Ireland, but spread to England, the United States, Australia and every country where Irish emigrants gathered.

Shocked by the scenes of starvation and greatly influenced by the revolutions then sweeping Europe, the Young Irelanders moved from agitation to armed rebellion in 1848. The attempted rebellion failed after a small skirmish in Ballingary, County Tipperary, coupled with a few minor incidents elsewhere. The revolt&#x27;s failure was much influenced by the general weakening of the Irish population after three years of famine, mixed with premature promptings to rise up early, resulting in inadequate military preparations in turn contributing to disunity among the rebellion&#x27;s leaders.

The Government quickly rounded up many of the instigators. Those who could, fled across the seas and their followers dispersed. The last flicker of revolt in 1849, led by amongst others James Fintan Lalor, was equally unsuccessful.

John Mitchel, the most committed advocate of revolution, had been arrested early in 1848 and transported to Australia on the expressly created charge of Treason-felony. He was to be joined by other leaders, such as William Smith O&#x27;Brien and Thomas Francis Meagher who had both been arrested after Ballingary escaped to France, as did three of the younger members, James Stephens, John O&#x27;Mahony and Michael Doheny.

== Founding ==
After the collapse of the &#x27;48 rebellion James Stephens and John O&#x27;Mahony went to the Continent to avoid arrest. In Paris, they supported themselves by teaching and translation work and planned the next stage of &quot;the fight to overthrow British rule in Ireland&quot;. In 1856 O&#x27;Mahony went to America and in 1858 founded the Fenian Brotherhood. Stephens returned to Ireland and in Dublin on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 1858, following an organising tour through the length and breadth of the country, founded the Irish counterpart of the American Fenians, the Irish Republican Brotherhood.

In 1863 the Brotherhood adopted a constitution and rules for general government. The First National Congress was organised in Chicago in November 1863. It allowed the organisation to be &quot;reconstituted on the model of the
institutions of the Republic, governing itself on the elective principle&quot;. Motions were passed to elect a Head Centre, with a Central Council of five elected members in 1863. This was extended to a Council of ten members at the second congress, held at Metropolitan Hall in Cincinnati, Ohio in January 1865, also with a President to be elected by the Council. This established a more distinctive republican style of governance with a Central Council or Senate and a Chief of the Senate, as well as a Presidential role with limited powers; O&#x27;Mahony was made President. Subsequently, this created a divided camp, as the Senate had powers to out-vote O&#x27;Mahony on future decisions.

==Fenian raids into Canada==
In the United States, O&#x27;Mahony&#x27;s presidency over the Fenian Brotherhood was being increasingly challenged by William R. Roberts. Both Fenian factions raised money by the issue of bonds in the name of the &quot;Irish Republic&quot;, which were bought by the faithful in the expectation of their being honoured when Ireland should be &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot;. These bonds were to be redeemed &quot;six months after the recognition of the independence of Ireland&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants subscribed.
Large quantities of arms were purchased, and preparations were openly made by the Roberts faction for a coordinated series of raids into Canada, which the United States government took no major steps to prevent. Many in the US administration were not indisposed to the movement because of Britain&#x27;s actions of what was construed as assisting the Confederacy during the American Civil War, such as CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and blockade runners smuggling in weapons. Roberts&#x27; &quot;Secretary for War&quot; was General T. W. Sweeny, who was struck off the American army list from January 1866 to November 1866 to allow him to organise the raids. The purpose of these raids was to seize the transportation network of Canada, with the idea that this would force the British to exchange Ireland&#x27;s freedom for possession of their Province of Canada. Before the invasion, the Fenians had received some intelligence from like-minded supporters within Canada but did not receive support from all Irish Catholics, as there those who saw the invasions as threatening the emerging Canadian sovereignty.

In April 1866, under the command of John O&#x27;Mahony, a band of more than 700 members of the Fenian Brotherhood arrived at the Maine shore opposite Campobello Island with the intention of seizing it from the British. British warships from Halifax, Nova Scotia were quickly on the scene and a military force dispersed the Fenians. This action served to reinforce the idea of protection for New Brunswick by joining with the British North American colonies of Nova Scotia, Canada East, and Canada West in Confederation to form the Dominion of Canada.

The command of the expedition in Buffalo, New York, was entrusted by Roberts to Colonel John O&#x27;Neill, who crossed the Niagara River (the Niagara is the international border) at the head of at least 800 (O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s figure; usually reported as up to 1,500 in Canadian sources) men on the night and morning of 31 May/1 June 1866, and briefly captured Fort Erie, defeating a Canadian force at Ridgeway. Many of these men, including O&#x27;Neill, were battle-hardened veterans of the American Civil War. In the end, the invasion had been broken by the US authorities&#x27; subsequent interruption of Fenian supply lines across the Niagara River and the arrests of Fenian reinforcements attempting to cross the river into Canada. It is unlikely that with such a small force they would have ever achieved their goal.

Other Fenian attempts to invade occurred throughout the next week in the St. Lawrence Valley. As many of the weapons had in the meantime been confiscated by the US army, relatively few of these men actually became involved in the fighting. There even was a small Fenian raid on a storage building that successfully got back some weapons that had been seized by the US Army. Many were eventually returned anyway by sympathetic officers.

To get the Fenians out of the area, both in the St. Lawrence and Buffalo, the U.S. government purchased rail tickets for the Fenians to return to their homes if the individuals involved would promise not to invade any more countries from the United States. Many of the arms were returned later if the person claiming them could post bond that they were not going to be used to invade Canada again, although some were possibly used in the raids that followed.

In December 1867, O&#x27;Neill became president of the Roberts faction of the Fenian Brotherhood, which in the following year held a great convention in Philadelphia attended by over 400 properly accredited delegates, while 6,000 Fenian soldiers, armed and in uniform, paraded the streets. At this convention, a second invasion of Canada was conceived. The news of the Clerkenwell explosion was a strong incentive to a vigorous policy. At the time, Henri Le Caron, a mole for British Intelligence, held the position of &quot;Inspector-General of the Irish Republican Army&quot;. Le Caron later asserted that he distributed fifteen thousand stands of arms and almost three million rounds of ammunition in the care of the many trusted men stationed between Ogdensburg, New York and St. Albans, Vermont, in preparation for the intended raid. It took place in April 1870 and proved a failure just as rapid and complete as the attempt of 1866. The Fenians under O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s command crossed the Canadian frontier near Franklin, Vermont, but were dispersed by a single volley from Canadian volunteers. O&#x27;Neill himself was promptly arrested by the United States authorities acting under the orders of President Ulysses S. Grant.

After resigning as president of the Fenian Brotherhood, John O&#x27;Neill unsuccessfully attempted an unsanctioned raid in 1871 and joined his remaining Fenian supporters with refugee veterans of the Red River Rebellion. The raiding party crossed the border into Manitoba at Pembina, Dakota Territory and took possession of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post on the Canada side. U.S. soldiers from the fort at Pembina, with permission of Canadian official Gilbert McMicken, crossed into Canada and arrested the Fenian raiders without resistance.

The Fenian threat prompted calls for Canadian confederation. Confederation had been in the works for years but was only implemented in 1867, the year following the first raids. In 1868, a Fenian sympathiser assassinated Irish-Canadian politician Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee in Ottawa, allegedly in response to his condemnation of the raids.

Fear of Fenian attack plagued the Lower Mainland of British Columbia during the 1880s, as the Fenian Brotherhood was active in both Washington and Oregon, but no raids ever materialized . At the inauguration of the mainline of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, photos taken of the occasion show three large British warships sitting in the harbour just off the railhead and its docks. Their presence was explicitly because of the fear of Fenian invasion or terrorism, as were the large numbers of troops on the first train.

==1867 and after==

During the latter part of 1866 Stephens endeavoured to raise funds in America for a fresh rising planned for the following year. He issued a bombastic proclamation in America announcing an imminent general rising in Ireland; but he was himself soon afterwards deposed by his confederates, among whom dissension had broken out.

The Fenian Rising proved to be a &quot;doomed rebellion&quot;, poorly organised and with minimal public support. Most of the Irish-American officers who landed at Cork, in the expectation of commanding an army against England, were imprisoned; sporadic disturbances around the country were easily suppressed by the police, army and local militias.

After the 1867 rising, IRB headquarters in Manchester opted to support neither of the dueling American factions, promoting instead a new organisation in America, Clan na Gael. The Fenian Brotherhood itself, however, continued to exist until voting to disband in 1880.

In 1881, the submarine &quot;Fenian Ram&quot;, designed by John Philip Holland for use against the British, was launched by the Delamater Iron Company in New York.

<text>Workflow is a generic term for orchestrated and repeatable patterns of activity, enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms.

From a more abstract or higher-level perspective, workflow may be considered a view or representation of real work. The flow being described may refer to a document, service, or product that is being transferred from one step to another.

Workflows may be viewed as one fundamental building block to be combined with other parts of an organization&#x27;s structure such as information technology, teams, projects and hierarchies.

== Historical development ==
The development of the concept of a workflow occurred above a series of loosely defined, overlapping eras.

=== Beginnings in manufacturing ===
The modern history of workflows can be traced to Frederick Taylor and Henry Gantt, although the term &quot;workflow&quot; was not in use as such during their lifetimes. One of the earliest instances of the term &quot;work flow&quot; was in a railway engineering journal from 1921.

Taylor and Gantt launched the study of the deliberate, rational organization of work, primarily in the context of manufacturing. This gave rise to time and motion studies. Related concepts include job shops and queuing systems (Markov chains).

The 1948 book &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; introduced the emerging concepts to the context of family life.

=== Maturation and growth ===
The invention of the typewriter and the copier helped spread the study of the rational organization of labor from the manufacturing shop floor to the office. Filing systems and other sophisticated systems for managing physical information flows evolved. Several events likely contributed to the development of formalized information workflows. First, the field of optimization theory matured and developed mathematical optimization techniques. For example, Soviet mathematician and economist Leonid Kantorovich developed the seeds of linear programming in 1939 through efforts to solve a plywood manufacturer&#x27;s production optimization issues. Second, World War II and the Apollo program drove process improvement forward with their demands for the rational organization of work.

=== Quality era ===
In the post-war era, the work of W. Edwards Deming and Joseph M. Juran led to a focus on quality, first in Japanese companies, and more globally from the 1980s: there were various movements ranging from total quality management to Six Sigma, and then more qualitative notions of business process re-engineering. This led to more efforts to improve workflows, in knowledge economy sectors as well as in manufacturing. Variable demands on workflows were recognised when the theory of critical paths and moving bottlenecks was considered.

==Workflow management==
Basu and Kumar note that the term &quot;workflow management&quot; has been used to refer to tasks associated with the flow of information through the value chain rather than the flow of material goods: they characterise the definition, analysis and management of information as &quot;workflow management&quot;. They note that workflow can be managed within a single organisation, where distinct roles are allocated to individual resources, and also across multiple organisations or distributed locations, where attention needs to be paid to the interactions between activities which are located at the organizational or locational boundaries. The transmission of information from one organization to another is a critical issue in this inter-organizational context and raises the importance of tasks they describe as &quot;validation&quot;, &quot;verification&quot; and &quot;data usage analysis&quot;.

== Workflow management systems==
A workflow management system (WfMS) is a software system for setting up, performing, and monitoring a defined sequence of processes and tasks, with the broad goals of increasing productivity, reducing costs, becoming more agile, and improving information exchange within an organization. These systems may be process-centric or data-centric, and they may represent the workflow as graphical maps. A workflow management system may also include an extensible interface so that external software applications can be integrated and provide support for wide area workflows that provide faster response times and improved productivity.

== Related concepts ==
The concept of workflow is closely related to several fields in operations research and other areas that study the nature of work, either quantitatively or qualitatively, such as artificial intelligence (in particular, the sub-discipline of AI planning) and ethnography. The term &quot;workflow&quot; is more commonly used in particular industries, such as in printing or professional domains such as clinical laboratories, where it may have particular specialized meanings.

# Processes: A process is a more general notion than workflow and can apply to, for example, physical or biological processes, whereas a workflow is typically a process or collection of processes described in the context of work, such as all processes occurring in a machine shop.
# Planning and scheduling: A plan is a description of the logically necessary, partially ordered set of activities required to accomplish a specific goal given certain starting conditions. A plan, when augmented with a schedule and resource allocation calculations, completely defines a particular &quot;instance&quot; of systematic processing in pursuit of a goal. A workflow may be viewed as an often optimal or near-optimal realization of the mechanisms required to execute the same plan repeatedly.
# Flow control: This is a control concept applied to workflows, to distinguish from static control of buffers of material or orders, to mean a more dynamic control of flow speed and flow volumes in motion and in process. Such orientation to dynamic aspects is the basic foundation to prepare for more advanced job shop controls, such as just-in-time or just-in-sequence.
# In-transit visibility: This monitoring concept applies to transported material as well as to work in process or work in progress, i.e., workflows.

== Examples ==

The following examples illustrate the variety of workflows seen in various contexts:

# In machine shops, particularly job shops and flow shops, the flow of a part through the various processing stations is a workflow.
# Insurance claims processing is an example of an information-intensive, document-driven workflow.
# Wikipedia editing can be modeled as a stochastic workflow.
# The Getting Things Done system is a model of personal workflow management for information workers.
# In software development, support and other industries, the concept of &quot;follow-the-sun&quot; describes a process of passing unfinished work across time zones.
# In traditional offset and digital printing, the concept of workflow represents the process, people, and usually software technology (RIPs raster image processors or DFE digital front end) controllers that play a part in pre/post processing of print-related files, e.g., PDF pre-flight checking to make certain that fonts are embedded or that the imaging output to plate or digital press will be able to render the document intent properly for the image-output capabilities of the press that will print the final image.
# In scientific experiments, the overall process (tasks and data flow) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This DAG is referred to as a workflow, e.g., Brain Imaging workflows.
# In healthcare data analysis, a workflow can be identified or used to represent a sequence of steps which compose a complex data analysis.
# In service-oriented architectures, an application can be represented through an executable workflow, where different, possibly geographically distributed, service components interact to provide the corresponding functionality under the control of a workflow management system.
# In shared services, an application can be in the practice of developing robotic process automation (called RPA or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0 based on artificial intelligence) which results in the deployment of attended or unattended software agents to an organization&#x27;s environment. These software agents, or robots, are deployed to perform pre-defined structured and repetitive sets of business tasks or processes. Artificial intelligence software robots are deployed to handle unstructured data sets and are deployed after performing and deploying robotic process automation.

== Features and phenomenology ==
# Modeling: Workflow problems can be modeled and analyzed using graph-based formalisms like Petri nets.
# Measurement: Many of the concepts used to measure scheduling systems in operations research are useful for measuring general workflows. These include throughput, processing time, and other regular metrics.
# Specialized connotations: The term &quot;workflow&quot; has specialized connotations in information technology, document management, and imaging. Since 1993, one trade consortium specifically focused on workflow management and the interoperability of workflow management systems, the Workflow Management Coalition.
# Scientific workflow systems: These found wide acceptance in the fields of bioinformatics and cheminformatics in the early 2000s, when they met the need for multiple interconnected tools that handle multiple data formats and large data quantities. Also, the paradigm of scientific workflows resembles the well-established practice of Perl programming in life science research organizations, making this adoption a natural step towards more structured infrastructure setup.
# Human-machine interaction: Several conceptualizations of mixed-initiative workflows have been studied, particularly in the military, where automated agents play roles just as humans do. For innovative, adaptive, and collaborative human work, the techniques of human interaction management are required.
# Workflow analysis: Workflow systems allow users to develop executable processes with no familiarity with formal programming concepts. Automated workflow analysis techniques can help users analyze the properties of user workflows to conduct verification of certain properties before executing them, e.g., analyzing flow control or data flow. Examples of tools based on formal analysis frameworks have been developed and used for the analysis of scientific workflows and can be extended to the analysis of other types of workflows.

== Workflow improvement theories ==
Several workflow improvement theories have been proposed and implemented in the modern workplace. These include:

# Six Sigma
# Total Quality Management
# Business Process Reengineering
# Lean systems
# Theory of Constraints

Evaluation of resources, both physical and human, is essential to evaluate hand-off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.

== Components ==
A workflow can usually be described using formal or informal flow diagramming techniques, showing directed flows between processing steps. Single processing steps or components of a workflow can basically be defined by three parameters:
#input description: the information, material and energy required to complete the step
#transformation rules: algorithms which may be carried out by people or machines, or both
#output description: the information, material, and energy produced by the step and provided as input to downstream steps

Components can only be plugged together if the output of one previous (set of) component(s) is equal to the mandatory input requirements of the following component(s). Thus, the essential description of a component actually comprises only input and output that are described fully in terms of data types and their meaning (semantics). The algorithms&#x27; or rules&#x27; descriptions need only be included when there are several alternative ways to transform one type of input into one type of output – possibly with different accuracy, speed, etc.

When the components are non-local services that are invoked remotely via a computer network, such as Web services, additional descriptors (such as QoS and availability) also must be considered.

== Applications ==
Many software systems exist to support workflows in particular domains. Such systems manage tasks such as automatic routing, partially automated processing, and integration between different functional software applications and hardware systems that contribute to the value-addition process underlying the workflow. There are also software suppliers using the technology process driven messaging service based upon three elements:

* Standard Objects
* Workflow Objects
* Workflow

<doc id="76665" wikidata="Q105095016" url="?curid=76665" title="Government of Botswana">
<text>The Government of Botswana often abbreviated as GOB, is the union government created by the constitution of Botswana having the executive, parliament, and the judiciary. The Seat of the Government is located in Gaborone, Botswana. The government is led by the president.

== Executive ==
This section defines the executive branch including the President, Vice President, and Cabinet.

=== The President ===
The President is the chief executive of the state. The President is elected president by members of the National Assembly. These members state on the ballot who they would support for President if elected, and after election to the National Assembly vote for whomever they indicated they would elect as President. The President has the following requirements: (a) is a citizen of Botswana by birth or descent; (b) has attained the age of 30 years; and (c) is qualified to be elected as a Member of the National Assembly. The President&#x27;s term is limited up to 10 years, or however long the President holds office in the National Assembly.

The executive power of Botswana resides solely in the President. The President is also the commander of the armed forces. The president also has the power to pardon a person convicted of a crime.

=== The Vice President ===
The Vice President is chosen by the President from among the members of the National Assembly. The Vice President takes over for the President when the President is unable to fulfil his duties either because of illness, death, or other reasons.The Vice President is second-in-command to the President and carries out the missions of the President.The current vice-president is Ndaba Gaolathe.

=== The Cabinet ===

This Cabinet is composed of the President, the Vice President and no more than six ministers who are appointed by the President from the National Assembly. The Ministers in the Cabinet are responsible for advising the President with respect to the policy of the government.

== Parliament ==
This section describes both the National Assembly as well as the Ntlo ya Dikgosi, which together create the Parliament of Botswana.

=== National Assembly ===
The Parliament consists of the President and National Assembly. The president is a voting member of the National Assembly. There are an additional 57 elected members of the National Assembly. There is also a speaker of the Assembly who is elected by the members of the Assembly, but does not necessarily have to be a member of the assembly themselves. There is also a deputy speaker elected by the Assembly.

In order for a person to be eligible to be a member of the Assembly they must: be a citizen of Botswana, be 18 years old, be registered to vote, and be able to speak and read in English. There are many conditions that disqualify a member from eligibility, most of these dealing with allegiance to other countries.

Botswana is divided into the number of constituencies that they have members of parliament so that each district sends one member to the Assembly. People in Botswana are eligible to vote if they are: 18, a citizen, and have resided in Botswana for 12 consecutive months.

=== Ntlo ya Dikgosi ===
In addition to a parliament, Botswana also has a Ntlo ya Dikgosi. The Ntlo ya Dikgosi acts as an advisory body to the Parliament of Botswana. This body consists of 33-35 members. In order to be eligible to be a member one must be 21 years old and a citizen. There are similar disqualifying conditions for this body as there are for the National Assembly. Members are appointed for 5-year terms. No member may participate in party politics, and many members are tribal chiefs. This body possesses no legislative power, including approval or veto power; rather they advise the Parliament on bills and measures. A power the body does have is to summon members of the government to appear before it.

== Local government ==
Local government is administered by nine district councils and five town councils. District commissioners have executive authority and are appointed by the central government and assisted by elected and nominated district councillors and district development committees. There has been ongoing debate about the political, social, and economic marginalization of the San (Bushmen). The government&#x27;s policies for remote area dwellers continue to spark controversy and may be revised in response to domestic and donor concerns.

== Judicature ==
This section describes the varying parts of the judiciary in Botswana including the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and the Judicial Service Commission.

=== High Court ===
The High Court of Botswana acts as the supreme legal source, in which the court possesses unlimited original jurisdiction to hear any cases. The court has a Chief Judge as well as a number of other judges, in which the number is determined by the Parliament. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President, as are all of the other Justices, but these can be advised to the President by the Parliament. In order to be qualified to be a judge on this court one must have either been a judge, been an attorney, been a law professor with a law degree, or been a Chief Magistrate. Appointments to this court are until the person reaches the age of 70. The only other reason a judge would leave the high court is if the Parliament decides the person is no longer able to properly perform their duties.

The High Court has authority to interpret the constitution. If there is disagreement on any interpretation, that disagreement is settled by the High Court.

Botswana has had ten chief justices:
=== Court of Appeal ===
The Court of Appeal has the right to hear any case in Botswana in which one party has appealed the decision found. This court consists of a President of the Court of Appeal, a number of other judges, and the entirety of the High Court. Like the High Court, the President is appointed by the President as are the other judges, with the advice of Parliament. In order to be qualified a person must have been either a judge, attorney, or law professor. As is with the High Court a person is appointed until the age of 70, barring Parliament does not find them incapable during their tenure.

=== Judicial Service Commission ===
The Judicial Service Commission is created to help advise the President on judicial nominations. It consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeals, the Attorney-General, the Chairman of the Public Service Commission, a member of the Law Society nominated by the Law Society, and a person of integrity and experience who is not a legal practitioner appointed by the President.

== Politics of Botswana ==
Politics of Botswana takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic, whereby the President of Botswana is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Parliament of Botswana. In part because the party system has been dominated by the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), which never lost power since the country gained independence, until 2024, the Economist Intelligence Unit has rated Botswana as a &quot;flawed democracy.&quot;

== Foreign relations ==
=== International organizations ===
ACP, AfDB, C, ECA, FAO, G-77, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, ICCt, ICFTU, ICRM, IDA, IFAD, IFC, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, Interpol, IOC, ISO, ITU, NAM, OAU, OPCW, SACU, SADC, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UNIDO, UPU, WCO, WFTU, WHO, WIPO, WMO, WTO, WT.

<doc id="76670" wikidata="Q105638570" url="?curid=76670" title="Government of Brunei">
<text>The Government of Brunei is the union government created by the constitution of Brunei where by the Sultan of Brunei is both head of state and head of government (Prime Minister of Brunei). Executive power is exercised by the government. Brunei has a legislative council with 36 appointed members, that only has consultative tasks. Under Brunei&#x27;s 1959 constitution, His Majesty Hassanal Bolkiah, is the head of state with full executive authority, including emergency powers since 1962. The Sultan&#x27;s role is enshrined in the national philosophy known as &quot;Melayu Islam Beraja&quot; (MIB), or Malay Islamic Monarchy. The country has been under hypothetical martial law since a rebellion occurred in the early 1960s and was put down by British troops from Singapore. The Seat of the Government is located in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei.

== Ministers and departments ==
The Deputy Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) assists the chief executive officer, who is known as the Menteri Besar. The state secretary, the attorney general, and the state financial officer are the three senior critical officials. The state financial officer is in charge of the treasury, the attorney general is in charge of the Criminal Prosecution Department, and the state secretary oversees all administrative matters with the assistance of an assistant state secretary. The heads of the state departments oversee the other departments, and they are required to confer with the state secretary prior to carrying out any projects or proposals. This holds true for the district as well.

Each state department has a branch in a district, and these branches report to the head of the department in charge at the department headquarters. The relevant district officers will function in this capacity in districts without such branches. The penghulus, ketua kampongs and assistant district officers themselves report to the District Officers.

== Judicial branch ==
Brunei has a dual legal system. The first is the system inherited from the British, similar to the ones found in India, Malaysia and Singapore. It is based on the English common law, but with codification of a significant part of it. The common law legal system covers most of Brunei&#x27;s laws.

The structure of the common law courts in Brunei starts with the magistracy. There are currently less than 10 magistrates for the country, all of whom are locals. A rung above the magistracy is the intermediate courts. This was set up to be a training ground for the local. There are currently two intermediate court judges, both are locals.

The High Court of the Supreme Court currently consist of three judges, two of whom are locals. The Chief Justice is a High Court of Hong Kong judge.

There is no jury system in Brunei; a judge or magistrate sits alone to hear a case except for capital punishment cases where two High Court judges will sit.

The Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court consists of three Judges, all of whom are currently retired British judges. The Court of Appeal sits twice a year for about a month each time.

Appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom in criminal cases are no longer available, whilst still retaining a very limited right of appeal to the J.C.P.C. in civil cases.

The other system of justice in Brunei is the shariah courts. It deals mainly in Muslim divorce and matters ancillary to a Muslim divorce in its civil jurisdiction and in the offences of &quot;khalwat&quot; (close proximity) and &quot;zina&quot; (adultery) amongst Muslims.

The shariah court structure is similar to the common law court structure except that it has no intermediate court and that the Court of Appeal is the final court of appeal.

All magistrates and judges in both the common law courts and the shariah courts are appointed by the Government. All local magistrates and judges were appointed from the civil service with none thus far being appointed from private practice.

== Territorial disputes ==
The sovereignty of the Territory of Limbang has been an ongoing issue between Brunei and Malaysia. It was reported in 2009 that a solution &quot;was achieved between the two governments, when Brunei dropped all claims to Limbang, thus recognising it as a Malaysian territory&quot;. These reports, however, were dismissed by Brunei&#x27;s former second minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade on 18 March 2009, who clarified that the claim on Limbang was never discussed [with Malaysia]. What was discussed between both countries was the demarcation of land boundaries on the whole. 

Brunei is one of many nations that lay claim to the disputed Spratly Islands, several small islands situated between Brunei and Labuan, Malaysia which include Kuraman Island. They are contested between Brunei and Malaysia, but are internationally recognised as part of the latter.

<doc id="76676" wikidata="Q336433" url="?curid=76676" title="Edward White Benson">
<text>Edward White Benson (14 July 1829 – 11 October 1896) was archbishop of Canterbury from 1883 until his death. Before this, he was the first Bishop of Truro, serving from 1877 to 1883, and began construction of Truro Cathedral.

He was previously a schoolmaster and was the first Master of Wellington College from 1859 to 1872.

== Life ==
Edward White Benson was born at Lombard Street in Highgate, Birmingham, on 14 July 1829, the eldest of eight children of chemical manufacturer Edward White Benson senior (26 August 1802 – 7 February 1843) and his wife Harriet Baker Benson (13 June 1805 – 29 May 1850). He was baptised in St Martin in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, on 31 March 1830. The family moved to Wychbold when his father became manager of the British Alkali Works at Stoke Prior, Worcestershire.

From 1840, he was educated at King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham and then Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA (8th in the Classical tripos) in 1852. At King Edward&#x27;s, under James Prince Lee, Benson &quot;manifested a deeply religious tone of mind and was fond of sermons&quot;.

===Cambridge Ghost Society===

The Cambridge Association for Spiritual Inquiry, known informally as the Cambridge Ghost Society or the Ghostlie Guild, was founded by Benson and Brooke Foss Westcott in 1851 at Trinity College. Westcott worked as its secretary until 1860. The society collected and investigated reports of ghosts. Other notable members included Alfred Barry and Henry Sidgwick. It has been described as a predecessor of the Society for Psychical Research. According to the &quot;Notebooks of Henry James&quot;, his source for the novella &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; was the Archbishop of Canterbury (i.e. Benson) at Addington Palace on 10 January 1895.

===Schoolmaster at Rugby and Wellington===

Benson began his career as a schoolmaster at Rugby School in 1852, and was ordained deacon in 1853 and priest in 1857. In 1859 Benson was chosen by Prince Albert as the first Master of Wellington College, Berkshire, which had recently been built as the nation&#x27;s memorial to the Duke of Wellington. Benson was largely responsible for establishing Wellington as a leading public school, closely modelled upon Rugby School.

===Lincoln and Truro===

From 1872 to 1877, he was Chancellor of Lincoln Cathedral. In 1874, he set up Lincoln Theological College.

He was appointed the first Bishop of Truro, where he served from 1877 to 1882. He was consecrated bishop by Archibald Campbell Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, on St Mark&#x27;s day, 25 April 1877 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.
The Diocese of Truro was established in December 1876. Construction of Truro Cathedral began in 1880 to a design by the Gothic Revival architect John Loughborough Pearson. From 24 October 1880 until 1887 a temporary wooden building on an adjacent site served as the cathedral. As archbishop, Benson consecrated the cathedral on 3 November 1887.

He founded Truro High School for Girls in 1880.

===Archbishop of Canterbury, 1883–1896===

In 1883 he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.

Five years later Benson avoided Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln, being prosecuted before a lay tribunal under the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 for six ritual offences by hearing the case in his own archiepiscopal court (inactive since 1699). In his judgement (often called &quot;the Lincoln Judgement&quot;), he found against the bishop on two points, with a proviso as to a third that when performing the manual acts during the prayer of consecration in the Holy Communion service, the priest must stand in a way that is visible to the people.

Benson tried to amalgamate the two Convocations and the new houses of laity into a single assembly. In 1896 it was established that they could &#x27;unofficially&#x27; meet together.

In September of the same year, the papal bull &quot;Apostolicae curae&quot;, which denied the validity of Anglican orders, was published and Benson had started a reply. He preached his last sermon at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Armagh on 27 September: there is a memorial to him in the north aisle there. He was taken ill while attending Sunday service in St Deiniol&#x27;s Church, Hawarden, Wales, on 11 October 1896, during a visit to the former Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone. His death was attributed to heart failure. Three days later his body was put on the train at Sandycroft station to be returned to London.

He was buried at Canterbury Cathedral, in a magnificent tomb located at the western end of the nave. The tomb is emblazoned with the epitaph Benson had chosen: &quot;Miserere mei Deus Per crucem et passionem tuam libera me Christe&quot; (&quot;Have mercy on me O Christ our God, Through Thy Cross and Passion, deliver thou me&quot;).

His work concerning Saint Cyprian, &quot;Cyprian: his life, his times, his work&quot;, was published posthumously, in the year after his death.

==Legacy==

Benson is best remembered for devising the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, an order first used in Truro Cathedral on Christmas Eve, 1880. Considerably revised by Eric Milner-White for King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, this service is now broadcast every Christmas around the world.

Benson was the founder of the Church of England Purity Society, an organisation which later merged with the White Cross Army. Alfred Ryder served as a trustee of the organisation.

Benson told Henry James a simple, rather inexpert story he had heard about the ghosts of evil servants who tried to lure young children to their deaths. James recorded the idea in his &quot;Notebooks&quot; and eventually used it as the starting-point for his classic ghost story, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;.

The hymn &quot;God Is Working His Purpose Out&quot; was written by Arthur C. Ainger as a tribute to Benson as both were Masters at Eton and Rugby respectively.

In 1914, a boarding house at Wellington College was named in his honour. Benson House carries the emblem of a blue Tudor Rose, and is situated in its own corner of the college grounds.

== Personal life ==
Benson married his second cousin Mary (Minnie) Sidgwick, the sister of philosopher Henry, when she was 18, having proposed to her when she was 12 and he was 24. The couple had six children. Benson also supervised the education of his younger sister Ada Benson who was left an orphan in 1852.

Their fifth child was the novelist Edward Frederic Benson, best remembered for his &quot;Mapp and Lucia&quot; novels. Another son was Arthur Christopher Benson, the author of the lyrics to Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot; and master of Magdalene College, Cambridge. Their sixth and youngest child, Robert Hugh Benson, became a priest in the Church of England before converting to Catholicism and writing many popular novels. Their daughter, Margaret Benson, was an artist, author and Egyptologist. None of the children married; and some appeared to suffer from mental illnesses, possibly bipolar disorder.

After the archbishop&#x27;s death, his widow set up household with Lucy Tait, daughter of the previous archbishop of Canterbury, Archibald Campbell Tait. A biography of Mary Benson, using her numerous letters, was published in 2011. It characterised her husband as living &quot;a life of relentless success&quot;.

Edward Benson&#x27;s aunt, his father&#x27;s maternal half-sister, was the botanical illustrator Mary Ann Jackson.

==Ancestry==

The Benson family was of Scandinavian origin with the name of Bjornsen. The Bensons &quot;emerge into history&quot; as an English family in 1348 when John Benson held a &quot;&quot; from the Abbey at Swinton-by-Masham in Yorkshire.

Arthur Christopher Benson, the archbishop&#x27;s son, wrote a genealogy of his family. He found that &quot;Old&quot; Christopher Benson (born 1703) was the &quot;real founder of the fortunes&quot; of the Benson family having acquired a &quot;good deal&quot; of land. He also &quot;established a large business.&quot;

Archbishop Edward White Benson&#x27;s grandfather was Captain White Benson, of the 6th Regiment of Foot. The archbishop&#x27;s seal and the Captain&#x27;s coat of arms show their branch of the Benson family arms were blazoned: Argent, a quatrefoil between two trefoils slipped in bend sable, between four bendlets gules.

The archbishop&#x27;s father was Edward White Benson (born in York in 1802, died at Birmingham Heath in 1843). He was a Fellow of the Royal Botanical Society of Edinburgh and the author of books on education and religion. He was also an inventor whose inventions made &quot;considerable fortunes&quot; for others, but not for him.
